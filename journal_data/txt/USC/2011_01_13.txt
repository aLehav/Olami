Even without their senior leader Jaevan Catron, the hapless Oregon Ducks (8-9, 1-4) treated the 12,000 strong at the brand new Matthew Knight Arena with an opening night 68-62 victory on Thursday night over USC (10-7, 2-2).
Staked to a 20-point lead midway through the 2nd half, the Ducks behind a balanced offensive attack led by  sophomore forward E.J. Singler (10 points and six rebounds) and junior guard Malcolm Armstead (11 points and three assists), survived a late 25-11 run by the Trojans to notch their first win in conference play.
For the Trojans, senior guard Donte Smith led all scores with 13 points, and junior forward Nikola Vucevic tallied 11 points and 13 rebounds in a losing effort.
The loss denied USC of their first three-game win streak on the 2010-2011season and drops them to a tie for 4th place in the Pac-10 standings.
USC will close out their two-game Oregon road trip in Corvallis on Saturday night at 7:30 p.m. PST to take on the Oregon State Beavers (7-9, 2-3).
The Cardinal and Gold haven’t won on the road at Oregon State since January of 2008.
FIRE KO!  He cannot run an offense to beat the zone to save his life.  What a joke.  We’re wasting the opportunity to really put together a great program with UCLA down by keeping KO – fired everywhere he has been.  If Pat Haden cared at all about bball – He’d go find USC a coach that can teach offense.

USC’s Panhellenic Council wants to widen the positive gap between the all-Panhellenic GPA and the all-female GPA in hopes of combatting stereotypes and making the Greek system more attractive to potential members.
Sisterhood · A student enters the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority house on The Row. A study shows that Panhellenic sorority members have higher GPAs than the average female student attending USC. - Cory Sanford | Daily Trojan 
For the spring 2010 semester, Panhellenic sorority members had an average GPA of 3.41, which is .07 points higher than the all-school female average of 3.34.
To further raise the Panhellenic GPA, Zara Abrams, vice president of scholarship, is planning a number of new initiatives for 2011.
“I want to create a website to help provide tutoring and study groups among Greek women,” Abrams said. “Also, I have been working with the Career Center to plan networking opportunities for the Greek community.”
Historically, the Panhellenic GPA tends to be above that of the university-wide, all-female GPA. In the fall of 2009 the Panhellenic GPA was 3.38 and the all-women’s was 3.35. This is a trend the new Panhellenic President Ayushi Gummadi hopes to continue.
“Scholarship is a number one priority,” Gummadi said. “Showing the USC community that sororities hold themselves to a high academic standard will not only fight stereotypes, but increase our attractiveness to incoming students because it shows we are a very well-balanced community.”
Beth Saul, director of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership, said one possible explanation for the higher Panhellenic GPA could be the academic support system in each house.
“There is a lot of attention given to scholarship as a new member, and also as a continuing member,” Saul said. “The sororities have some pretty high standards regarding requirements and they really monitor members if they are below certain GPAs.”
Furthermore, the resources available to those in Panhellenic houses are helpful in achieving academic goals, Gummadi said.
“I think having communities, the support of your chapter and having girls in your chapter to study with is helpful,” Gummadi said.
Individual incentives for sororities on The Row are also in place to stimulate high academic performances.
“We would like to raise the Panhellenic GPA even higher, so we decided to put out an academic challenge last year,” Saul said. “Any chapter that raised its GPA by .03 or higher received a special dinner for their scholarship chair. The incentive was so successful that we have decided to do it again with the fall to spring grades.”
Despite the high academic support in the Panhellenic community, there are still many stereotypes surrounding sororities.
“I had no idea that the sorority GPA was higher. If they are concerned with changing what they think might be a negative image, then they need to advertise their GPA more,” said Scott Macklin, a senior majoring in aerospace engineering.
The new Panhellenic cabinet aims to increase the academic resources and opportunities for all Panhellenic sororities on campus to bolster their GPAs.
“One of the main reasons I wanted to be a part of Panhellenic was because I have experienced the stereotype of sorority women first hand,” Abrams said. “People have to realize it’s a stereotype and they are not embracing an academic picture of Greek life. It is not so much about changing our image but showing them what Greek life really is.”
I can’t believe the university all-female GPA is so high! Should the average student really be getting a B+?? [This isn’t sexist–I’m sure the men’s GPA is just as inflated–the article just doesn’t discuss the male statistics…]
HA! I guess you Greeks forgot to mention the massive test banks you have in your files.

USC athletic director Pat Haden resoundingly ended a few circulating rumors today concerning the university’s upcoming appeal to the NCAA. While reports last week from uscfootball.com stated that USC would sue the NCAA and appeal further after the Jan. 22 hearing, Haden refused to give those statements any validity.
“This is it,” Haden said. “There is no appeal after this. This is the final frontier.”
When USC sits before an NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee in 10 days, it hopes to cut down the sanctions currently imposed on the football program by half.  Currently the sanctions include a two-year bowl ban and the loss of 30 scholarships.
According to Haden, who spoke at the ground breaking of the new athletic complex today, the recent NCAA cases concerning Auburn and Ohio State have no relation to USC and its case with the NCAA. He made clear his belief that those decisions will not affect the final decision to be made concerning USC.
“A lot of people say it’s going to help you – I don’t think so,” Haden said. “I don’t think it helps or hurts us; I think it’s irrelevant.”

The USC Computing Center in King Olympic Hall reopened its doors Monday with improvements to its facilities and technology.
The new area includes collaborative spaces for students, a classroom with 33 computers, 16 open computers, 30 loaner laptops, wireless printing, eco-friendly mobile furniture and a more interactive layout, according to Emanuel Alvarez, a learning environment support specialist.
“It used to look very institutional and old school with just rows of computers,” Alvarez said. “We wanted to make it more accessible and comfortable for students.”
The computing center in KOH, along with the two other learning centers on campus in the Henry Salvatori Computer Science Center and the Waite Phillips Hall of Education, now offer laptops and computers that are dual-boot so students can choose whether to work with Mac or PC software.
Some students like the new layout of the center, but say they wish it had more computers.
“It’s in a convenient location and it’s pretty comfortable to do work here, but there are not really as many computers as the old one,” said Soyoung Kang, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering.
Though there are fewer computers in the updated center, Joseph Cevetello, the director of Learning Environments, said the space is designed with students in mind.
“Almost 90 percent of our students have laptops so we want them to use their computers in a more comfortable and collaborative environment,” Cevetello said.
Students can rent the laptops for free for four hours with a USC ID card and work together in the shared spaces that include a whiteboard and 60-inch display boards for students who want to demonstrate their powerpoints in a soundproof room.
The center is accessible for all students, faculty and staff every day from 7:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.

USC’s Queer and Ally Student Assembly next week will use art to provide an outlet for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth and to educate the public about bullying, depression and other challenges LGBT youth face.
The event, called Pride Project @ USC, is open to the public and will take place in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Forum from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday Jan. 18. The evening will consist of a silent auction of art made by LGBT youth from around the country.
Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center, said one of the evening’s primary goals is to provide creative alternatives to hatred and other negativity, in light of last fall’s highly publicized LGBT youth suicides.
“It offers an alternative for those youth to put their anger or frustration or anxiety about being LGBT by focusing that energy into art … whether that be graphic art or actual paintings or poetry,” Vigil said.
Proceeds from the auction will go to a fund to help incorporate Pride Project, which seeks to put Gay-Straight Alliance groups in middle and high schools and promote art as self-expression within those groups.
Kylie Johns and Ayden Mace, the organization’s founders, will speak Tuesday evening.
Victoria Quintanar, a junior majoring in theatre and vice president of community outreach for Rainbow Scholars, said she is hoping for about 100 people will  attend.
“Art is a universal language, and a lot of college students can relate to that,” she said. “If they show up and are there to bid on the art, that is how it comes full circle.”

Students will soon have another option for their pharmacy needs.
CVS Pharmacy is scheduled to open Jan. 23 in the University Gateway complex on Figueroa and 32nd Streets, according to Michael DeAngelis, the director of public relations for CVS.
Convenience · Freshmen Gordon Chen, undeclared, and Alexa Chiang, a business administration major, sit outside the new CVS opening at University Gateway on Figueroa and 32nd at the end of this month. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
The only pharmacies currently available near campus for students is the USC Pharmacy located on the first floor of the Student Union Center and the pharmacy in the University Village.
John Hrovat, director of Urban Partners, LLC, the developers of Gateway, wrote in an e-mail that he thinks both USC students and the surrounding area will benefit from the addition of CVS.
“University Gateway is very excited to have CVS as part of the retail mix,” Hrovat wrote. “We knew that adding a CVS at Gateway would not only be a good fit with the building – but an excellent service to the community.”
The hours for CVS will be 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Mondays through Fridays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m on Saturdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. The hours for the USC Pharmacy are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Mondays through Fridays.
“It’s convenient to use a CVS,” Hrovat said. “You can drive there, park and go in. We’re not going to operate 24 hours from the get-go, but we will probably work up to it.”
Justin Lacey, a senior majoring in finance and accounting, said the longer hours would entice more students to go to CVS.
“The hours for the USC Pharmacy are not long at all,” Lacey said. “So if another place has more opportunities for student to pick up meds and stuff then they’ll definitely go there.”
Mackenzie Martin, a junior majoring in health and humanity, said she is excited for CVS to open because she has found that the USC Pharmacy tends to be expensive.
Despite some beliefs that the USC Pharmacy is more expensive than other pharmacies, Michael Rudolph, executive director of the USC Pharmacy, said there is no significant price difference between products sold at CVS or at the USC Pharmacy.
“We specifically offer generic alternatives to most over-the-counter products with large savings for our students,” Rudolph said.
Although the CVS in Gateway will provide students with another pharmaceutical option, Rudolph said he is not worried about the competition because the USC Pharmacy offers a range of products and services that are unique to students.
“The USC Pharmacies offer many programs for students, including smoking cessation, asthma and diabetes management and numerous other student-centered education programs to help proactively provide medication and disease management,” Rudolph said.
Cathy DeFrancesco, senior associate administrator and student health plans administrator for the University Park Health Center, said the USC Pharmacy customizes its services for students.
“The pharmacists and the pharmacy staff have worked to build relationships with their student customers, and I know that this level of caring is important to students and their families,” DeFrancesco said.
For students, the decision about which pharmacy to shop at might depend on which store is more convenient.
Nicole Cruz, a junior majoring in Italian and psychology, said the USC Pharmacy’s unique student services wouldn’t be enough to draw her away from CVS.
“I don’t have much free time, so I would probably just go to CVS since it’s closer to me,” Cruz said.
“The pharmacists and the pharmacy staff have worked to build relationships with their student customers…”
Yea, right. The ladies that work there are so slow and grumpy.
The headline reads that “CVS opens close to Gateway”, while it is actually within gateway itself, not close to it.
Students beware: CVS sells products which are out of date, so be sure to check freshness for everything…..Over the counter medications and food…..It iis not against the law to do this…..Just another tricky way for CVS to make money…
It should be noted that the CVS will sell liquor, and that has to be a big part of its business plan. There is even a “Liquor” sign up next to the CVS sign.

The best summary of Cirque Berzerk came from a photographer attending the event’s celeb-studded red carpet: “A sexy mix between Cirque du Soleil and Tim Burton’s movies.”
The show is an upscale circus act mixed with an engaging plot, a variety of music and complex costumes that make for a thrilling experience.
Nathan Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
Cirque Berzerk, which opened Jan. 7th at L.A. Live’s Club Nokia to a full house, begins with a humorous opening act. A pathetic magician materializes and performs unsuccessful tricks for  anticipating audience members, who are unaware that the poor attempt at wizardry is just a distraction in preparation for the upcoming spectacle.
A slender woman (Emilie Livingston) wearing a bright red dress and surrounded by burly men wearing matching grey suits enters the stage to kick off the show, which follows the journey of the woman in red as she escapes her mundane corporate life and discovers the wonders of Cirque Berzerk: A traveling acrobatics freak show headed by the daunting ringmaster and his midget assistant.
From authentic magicians, male trapeze artists, contortionists and a couple using acrobatic straps, Cirque Berzerk has it all. Actors dance, jump, twist and fly across the stage in dazzling and resplendent musical numbers.
Nathan Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
The physical highlight of the show is easily “Dig It Down,” where four men bounced from one trampoline to the top of a tall wall or to another trampoline on the other side. This carefully orchestrated event is fun, humorous, death-defying and brought the fearful audience to its its feet several times Wednesday night.
The music that accompanies the show covers every genre imaginable, compliments of pitch-perfect back up singers and a groovy band featuring Oingo Boingo bassist Johnny Avila. There are rock, cabaret, opera, heavy metal and ballad numbers, each matched with a different circus act. The music enhances the scenes and gave each one a distinct ambiance.
Although the acts are amazing, the most outstanding element of the show is the work behind the scenes.
The sets are brilliant and mesmerizing, filled with so many things in the limited stage space. Actors fill three-floored structures on either side of the stage as well as a main elevated stage filling the back. A white sheet acts as a backdrop for numerous projections throughout the show. The characters’ makeup and costumes are intricate, frightening and very Burton-esque.
Cirque Berzerk did, however, encounter some technical mishaps during the show.
The sound level was borderline unbearable in the first number, with sudden blares of music capable of knocking a few eardrums out, but the event technicians managed to fix the sound level by the third song.
Nathan Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
The cheesy dialogue could also have used some work. The show clearly wasn’t written with any literary aspirations in mind, but its childish poetry is nothing to be admired.
Despite these weaknesses, the strengths of Cirque Berzerk, which was conceived at the 2004 Burning Man festival by Suzanne Bernel and Kevin Bourqe, far outweigh any simple dialogue or audio tremors.
It is a bizarre yet enjoyable show and definitely worth the investment.
Cirque Berzerk will continue performances through the end of the month at Club Nokia.

2 011 is the year of the tablet.
At least, that’s the buzz from Las Vegas. The annual Consumer Electronics Show wrapped up Sunday, and although it showcased a variety of new devices and software, like 4G Mobile and a TARDIS, shaped iPhone dock, tablets reigned supreme.
CES is a promotional tool for the tech industry. Many of the products on display won’t come out for a few more months, but they’re shown off as if to say, “Hey, look what our new device can do!,” or “This is something that will reinvent the tech industry.”
So,  will tablets really be that cutting-edge this year?
When Steve Jobs unveiled the iPad last year, it was an innovative device — a tablet that felt truly unique to its medium and not simply like a converted laptop.
Less than a year later, all the other developers are jumping on the bandwagon with their own versions of the tablet, from the HP Windows Slate to the upcoming Lenovo LePad, all with varying quality compared to the first superstar, but universal in their hope to garner the same amount of consumer interest and profit.
What the tablet craze has done, however, is highlight a cultural and consumer trend: Mainstream is not cutting edge.
When the iPad debuted, the cost and lack of a specialized app market kept it mostly in the hands of the heavy tech users — bloggers, tech reviewers and website developers. It was not something the average consumer was using.
So why is that? Most consumers are not interested in trying out technology just because it is a new, unproven design.
There is just not an interest in pursuing technology development among the general public. They are consumers, not innovators.
And although there is a kind of bemused fascination with those interested in technological development — from tech celebrities like Kevin Rose or Steve Jobs — or the occasional fad based around technology (like when computer hacking briefly took off after the first Matrix film came out), the mainstream has mostly kept the more complex aspects of the technological world at an arm’s length, and the technological world keeps most of its products to an exclusive group before deciding to mass market them.
With technology becoming a part of life, it would seem prudent for consumers to be more aware of the latest revolutionary tool, and continue to jump on it as quickly as possible.
The devices should not remain just elusive products that computer software geniuses use, but innovations that make life easier.
Perhaps the bigger issue is that the technological devices are not marketed to the average consumer first, but handed to those few completely immersed in the tech world.
Until Apple’s silhouetted dancing commercials came out, everyone was still rocking CD players and MP3 players were untested devices.
They weren’t really popular and not heavily marketed to the masses, despite the fact that MP3 players were clearly the way of the future.
The ultimate truth is that tablets are an important part of the current technological world, and as time passes they will catch on simply due to developers’ production of the devices.
And now that the manufacturers know what’s big in the consumer world, that means it will go widespread, and soon everyone will have some version of a tablet.
Events like CES are supposed to be a time to find the latest technology, and to see what will set the course for future development and lifestyles.
But really, it’s always going to be the dark horse, the out of nowhere surprise that takes the world by storm when the tech world decides to reveal the latest gadgets.
But only after the inside track has had its time to play with it.

It could be said that Mexico City-based Hello Seahorse! is what happens when first-world indie rock meets electronic-tinged experimental rock en español, but the band’s singer, Los Angeles-born Denise Gutierrez, would not agree.
Quirky quartet · Not only does their music show their personalities, but each member of Hello Seahorse! has a nickname. The band also strives to break the language barrier by creating songs that reel the listener in and vocals that express emotion even for those who don’t speak Spanish. -  Photo courtesy of Nacional Records  
“We are part of a new generation of bands in Mexico that are playing stuff that isn’t pop or traditional norteño,” said Gutierrez, who is also known as “Lo Blondo.” “But all these genres being thrown around — I just don’t feel part of it.”
Isolated from much of the mainstream music culture that inundates the lives of many Westernized teenagers, Gutierrez and her bandmates, including Fernando Burgos, a.k.a. Oro de Neta, Gabriel de Leon, a.k.a. Bonnz! and José Borunda, a.k.a. Joe, instead drew from their upbringings in Mexico to create music that is both personal and effortlessly universal.
“We as a band grew up listening to Mexican romance ballad singers like José José and people that aren’t from our generation,” Gutierrez said. “It’s a geographical thing, though. Wherever you are standing and whatever is happening around you — it can be new or old — is going to be an influence for you.”
Hello Seahorse! formed the group as teenagers, brought together by a Myspace ad in 2005. The band’s first album was … And the Jellyfish Parade, an album of cutesy, mostly English-language songs about heartache and mixtapes.
Hoy a Las Ocho, originally released in 2007 as a seven-song EP through the band’s Myspace page, brought more bubbly hooks and whimsical lyrics, but hinted at the changes to come.
Hoy a Las Ocho also ends with “Universo 2,” a song whose fuzzy guitars and electronic overload is such a departure from their previous efforts that it might as well have been produced by another band.
Bestia, the band’s 2009 breakout album, expanded on the experimental sounds of “Universo 2” (a remixed version of which ended up on Bestia’s final track list) by abandoning the sparkly Architecture in Helsinki vibes of its early days and capitalizing on its members’ maturing craftsmanship.
Gutierrez’s classically trained voice, Burgos’ electronic whimsy and de Leon’s complex time signatures culminated in ten tracks of English-free songs that thrust them into the Pitchfork-fueled indie spotlight and garnered them international airplay, a Stateside tour, a Latin Grammy and praise for being a more passionate, Mexican version of Canadian sweethearts Metric.
But that was merely the old Hello Seahorse!.
“Bestia really opened a lot of opportunities for us,” Gutierrez said.
“But it got to be too much. We weren’t prepared to have everyone falling over us. We were so young. We had to grow.”
They were supposed to be on a break in Mexico City for a month, but the band returned to the city after only a week and quickly decided to tell their label they were ready to record a new album.
“It would have been really sad to put those songs away and forget about them,” Gutierrez said.
“Other people thought we were crazy and that we were going to make something terrible, but this was a new year and we were new people with new ideas — it was just something we needed to do.”
Despite the fact that the entire album went from jam session to a mastered copy in less than four months, Lejos. No Tan Lejos — which translates to “Far. Not so far away” — is the band’s most artfully composed and musically adventurous album to date.
Full of dark synth melodies and lyrics, Lejos, which was released on iTunes in the United States on Tuesday,  doesn’t get stuck in your head like previous albums, but that’s exactly the point.
Scaling back from the band’s previous spritely hooks, Lejos’ mellow electronics take a more somber tone, and it’s here that Gutierrez’s voice shines. Acting as an instrument unto itself, her vocals soar above cloudy beats, communicating emotion that the music cannot do alone.
Like an opera singer, Gutierrez’s vocals express feelings beyond the all-Spanish words she is singing so that her message is clear even to those who haven’t met their foreign language requirement.
“It’s actually more fun knowing you have to prove to yourself that you have to be so expressive that someone who doesn’t speak your language is going to understand your emotions,” Gutierrez said.
Instead of trying to appeal to certain fan bases or waiting for record label approval of their ideas, Hello Seahorse! lives in the moment.
Gutierrez and her bandmates find no shame in changing their style.
It’s part of their growing process both as individuals and as a group, and Gutierrez is the first to admit there is much more to learn.
“I think a lot of things have been done already,” Gutierrez said. “But we’re always looking for something different.”
Hello Seahorse! will be performing at the El Rey Theater on Saturday at 8 p.m.
Correction: An earlier version of this article implied that Hello Seahorse! garnered international acclaim for Hoy a Las Ocho. That description in fact applies to Bestia, a different album. The article also mischaracterized the band’s Thursday night show as a launch party.

Love is in the air for Kisses.
Kisses’ Jesse Kivel and Zinzi Edmundson are an unusual duo with notable echoes of Hot Chip and David Byrne.
The band’s  music is  intriguing, given its laidback, nu-disco ambiance, a boon in today’s Lady Gaga and Katy Perry-dominated world.

With electronic, dance and pop elements, Kisses throws a modern spin on beloved and cherished seventies styles, particularly through their vast incorporation of keyboards.
The best part: Kisses remain decidedly low-profile, providing our privileged Trojan community with the opportunity to see them perform tonight at Tommy’s Place at 9 p.m. The performance is being put on by USC Spectrum.
The enthralling band found its start a year and a half ago. Kivel is actually part of another group, Princeton, and on the side he began working on his own music with Edmundson, his girlfriend. Princeton focused more on extensive touring and with the downtime came the creation we know as Kisses.
Musicians can radiate vanity, self-absorption and superiority. Kisses, however, is an exception.
Kivel and Edmundson prefer the intimacy of performing for a smaller crowd versus larger venues.
Granted, this preference is partially because they aren’t as well known, but Kivel and Edmundson both thrive on the energy of college student fans.
In terms of favorite creations, Edmundson favors “Midnight Lover,” possibly because she likes the idea of a chivalrous man; the lyrics repeatedly state, I would like to take you out for a nice steak dinner.
Jesse, on the other hand, prefers “A Weekend in Brooklyn,” a sweet and relaxed confession of thinking about one’s other half.
The two found inspiration for these songs and the others on their debut LP, The Heart of the Night Life, from the likes of Blondie, Talking Heads, electronic dance music and even art.
As the pair continues to build its own characteristic style, they are finding less need to imitate others.
As much as Kisses loves what it is doing, making a living as musicians is not without its tribulations.
“It can easily make you cynical,” Kivel said.
Both members of Kisses suggest that any aspiring musicians should understand that the music industry will always be skewed in interest and demographics, but they advise remaining optimistic.
Although the two are quite relaxed, they realize their profession is a serious business.  The duo understands the importance of finding a secure way to make the necessary funds amid the new fad of illegal internet downloading, but also do not necessarily condemn it.
“I’d be a hypocrite to frown upon pirating,” Kivel said.
He recognized filesharing as something that will always be a part of the music industry, but suggested that websites make it harder for files to be accessed, to discourage people from attempting to cheat hard-working musicians.
As a temporary solution, Kivel sees branding as the best way to be financially successful.
Kisses has found that from concert tickets to CDs to T-shirts, ancillary goods can provide a significant income boost for up-and-coming bands.
As for future plans, Kivel and Edmundson believe collaborations and opportunities will come naturally.
Princeton will be coming out with a record this year, a release that will be Kivel’s primary focus for the next few months.
A second Kisses release, however, is still within the realm of possibility.
“I’d saturate the market if I put out everything I wanted to,” Kivel said.

Presidential memoirs are regarded as a premier source of insight into the inner workings of government, and former President George W. Bush’s new book, Decision Points, effectively provides that insight. The book describes relationships between members of the administration, gives the President’s take on a number of important issues and illuminates the way our former leader during his time in office.
Deborah Ho | Daily Trojan
Unfortunately, the book leaves a disappointing impression. After reading it, I was convinced that Bush must be either ignorant or dishonest, because his descriptions of his time in office and of the world at large were far from fair.
According to Decision Points, Bush did virtually nothing wrong during his time in office, and there was little he could even have improved upon. He seems to think that his domestic and foreign policies left the country in a better position in 2009 than when he took office in 2001.
Bush’s most egregious mischaracterizations are in regard to the Middle East.
“The most dramatic advances for freedom came in the Middle East,” he writes. “In 2001, the region saw terrorism on the rise, raging violence between Palestinians and Israelis, the destabilizing influence of Saddam Hussein … and little progress toward political reform.
“By 2009, nations across the Middle East were actively fighting terrorism … Iraq was a multi-religious, multi-ethnic democracy and an ally of the United States. The Palestinian people had an increasingly peaceful government … momentum toward a democratic state that would live side by side with Israel in peace.”
Though there have been significant advances in some Middle Eastern countries, the region remains in turmoil. With each individual country he mentions, Bush grossly overstates progress and neglects to mention negative developments, many of which are related to his own policies.
Iraq might now be a democracy, but it also remains a site that still claims the lives of U.S. troops. The war there has been the largest source of instability in the region, and it has turned terrorists like Muqtada al-Sadr into politicians, distracted military resources from the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and helped turn Iran into an increasingly powerful threat to U.S. interests.
The future of Iraq remains uncertain; it seems likely that after the scheduled troop withdrawal at the end of this year, the young Iraqi state might not be strong enough to withstand the various internal pressures it faces.
Lebanon, meanwhile, might have kicked out Syrian troops, but its democracy continues to harbor Hezbollah, one of the world’s most dangerous terrorist organizations. Hezbollah currently holds 14 seats in the Lebanese parliament and, according to a recent report by The Economist, deployed 40,000 to 50,000 rockets along the Israeli border last summer.
The Palestinians have also elected a terrorist organization, Hamas, which currently controls Gaza. On the Israeli side, the governing coalition has become increasingly dependent on the counterproductive ultra-Orthodox settlers movement, giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu very little room to reach a prospective peace settlement. Clearly, peace is further off than ever.
This trick by Bush — overstating accomplishments, understating failures — is a pattern throughout the book. Bush would have us believing that the No Child Left Behind Act is a piece of civil rights legislation. That he made all the right decisions in the aftermath of Katrina, but wishes that others had not gotten in his way so he could have made them sooner.
Decision Points isn’t entirely bad. Bush comes off as a decent man, one with genuine intentions and strong moral convictions. If the book gives an honest assessment of his presidency and its effect on the United States and the world, then he clearly lacks the type of understanding necessary to govern properly.
“I believe that it will be impossible to reach definitive conclusions about my presidency for several decades,” he writes.
It is too early to pass final judgment on the Bush administration. But if Decision Points is an accurate indication of how Bush thought about the challenges he faced in office, then it might not be too early to judge that he lacked the skills necessary to be a good president.
Daniel Charnoff is a senior majoring in international relations (global business). His column, “Through the Static,” runs Fridays.
In his book, Bush claims that the worst moment of his Administration was being called a racist by Kanye West.
Wow, for a supposed leader to consider what this one hot-tempered individual THINKS or SAYS about him to be the worst part of his Administration tells volumes.  Really, this is worse than the fact that his decisions (Iraq, Katrina) led to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians is not much worse proves that this guy was far from the “Compassionate Conservative” he and Karl Rove marketed Bush as.

With a new semester underway, a perennial question comes to mind: What is the best way to purchase textbooks?
The number of options can be overwhelming. The bookstore offers every book you need for a course, but there are new books, used books and rentals, plus outside options like Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble and rental sites like Chegg.com.
Rentals are often the cheapest, and going that route can be tempting. Students will find that buying books online is the optimal solution in the long run, however.
Purchasing a textbook is a better use of money than renting. I always purchase textbooks online, except for when I have to buy the USC published titles, it’s easy for me to find a title online with the same quality and at a much lower price than in the bookstore. For example, a used novel on Amazon can cost less than $5, compared to one with a $20-$30 sticker in the bookstore.
Besides the low prices, the Amazon marketplace helps its customers make smart choices by providing detailed information for the books, such as a description, seller’s rating and feedback from other customers.
Renting textbooks might seem like an attractive option. Some rental companies try hard to minimize the differences between rented and owned books. Websites like Chegg.com advertise that you can “save hundreds of dollars by renting books,” while CampusBookRental.com allows students to highlight and take notes on their books for free.
The USC bookstore provides an online textbook rental service, which directly links to Bookrenter.com. Although companies try to give students more benefits, I would rather own a book without concern for additional charges for inappropriate use of the book.
These days, though, textbooks are facing some competition. E-books have become an attractive alternative, particularly with the introduction of the iPad. Admittedly, e-books are lighter, greener and sometimes cheaper. They also allow you to take as many notes as you want.
Last fall, USA Today reported that students at the Stanford School of Medicine who were given iPads found it easier to take notes and draw diagrams with the attached stylus pens than with their laptops. But purchasing e-books does bring several concerns including limited titles and high initial investment on e-books devices.
E-books users will also be able to recoup any of their costs by selling an unwanted title they have finished, as you could with a physical book, and they can’t buy used copies at significant discounts. If you order books on Amazon, you can still sell them back to the USC bookstore and make a few dollars at the end of the semester.
Amazon is the best mainstream choice to get your books without breaking the bank. But if you want to get creative,  the best way to get your textbooks for the semester is taking the initiative and organizing a trading system with students in your residential hall or apartment building. Students did just that to create Parkside’s Book Buddy program, where residents who don’t have the patience to sell their books online simply exchange books with each other.
Are we in the process of making a “net bookstore” that dominates the current system — the overpriced USC bookstore? Perhaps, but it requires overwhelming participation from the student body, a system that is good in theory but difficult to implement.
Emily Wang is a freshman majoring in business administration.
I suppose you can buy all your books, but my motto is, “if there is a cheaper/more efficient alternative — why not utilize it for your benefit?” I’ll always buy my favorite books, but why buy something new (that I may not possibly like) when I can read it first for free at the library? If I have a car, why live in expensive university housing when the neighborhood up the street is clean, safe, and cheaper?
For novels and older editions of texts I say online bookstores are a fine start. But newer texts that I won’t ever touch again after a semester or two? I do the comparison every year and renting always seems to win. The Amazon Marketplace included. Why? like novels, I do keep a few favorites, but the majority of texts are just wasting space and the buyback prices are horrific. It’s so much simpler to just rent the book, use it, and then send it back. 
Now of course, I was never a book highlighter – we couldn’t ‘abuse’ the texts in such a way back in primary and secondary school, so flashcards and handwritten notes have always been my preference – so worries of ruining a book to the extent that I’d have to pay extra has never crossed my mind. And the due dates are always reasonable, (and up until now, you could adjust it to your liking on chegg) so sending it back late is another fear I haven’t had to worry about. And furthermore, you’d have to drop your book in the toilet a couple times and then return it a week or two after the due date to be charged extra. They’re generally very lenient.
Now I love Amazon more than the next person. It is usually my first choice because of the student-free prime deal, and their incredibly fast shipping. However, with buying textbooks, it drifts down into the 3rd or 4th positions as my go-to store. But that’s just me. Some people really enjoy owning everything they have. I’m content with having my cake and eating it too.
Supply & Demand. All of my textbooks were cheaper “new” on Amazon than they were “used” at the bookstore for this semester.
To the naysayers aka “Mr. Schmidt antagonists”: 
I did a thorough PPM for my FBE entrepreneurial class that delved into the college textbook industry, and this was last year. I dubbed it “Rent-a-Book” and it’s essentially a textbook rental service. Unfortunately, Chegg and a few other industry “first movers” already hit this market, and usually it’s difficult to play catch up. Anyways, college bookstores aren’t the egregious, profit-grubbing entities that you naysayers believe to be. Yes, the textbook prices are noticeably higher relative to online entities. However, it’s true that a bulk of the profits from college stores are reinvested into the school’s other programs, such as athletic teams and other things that make attending college cheaper. College bookstores do not act like private businesses; the profits are “break even” if not anemic, and used for the betterment of the school. USC, with its stellar football program (well, maybe not these past couple years), greatly benefits from the bookstore profits. Those uniforms/gear and other logistical needs don’t fall on the football players’ laps out of thin air. 
You people, Trojans especially, are very smart people. You are tech-savvy, but act like the bookstore victimizes you. If you want to buy/rent from a cheaper online source, so be it. To each his/her own.
@ Charles Schmidt,
Your response to the author of this article is quite interesting in terms of the statistics you present, but there are several things I like to quickly address:
1. If you are referring to books sold directly from Amazon, then about 20% of the time, I have found the price of a book is the same at the bookstore, but many students buy used books and Amazon’s marketplace book prices are 2-3x cheaper than what is offered at a bookstore. Furthermore, one might say the bookstore may have used copies, but I have found it difficult to purchase a used copy due to limited quantities. Furthermore, your statistics regarding amazon’s price differences is solely based on new books, which doesn’t offer much strength to your argument since used copies are preferred by college students and when you put used books’ prices into play, then the price drop is quite big.
2. This may sound quite selfish of me but frankly, if a legitimate business (online or not) offers the ability to purchase a textbook/book at a lower cost, then I will undoubtedly purchase my book from there. I really don’t care if my purchase doesn’t benefit the economy or not. I have to find ways to save money and help take the pressure off of my parents and I’m sure many other college students share the same sentiments. 
3. To me, your lower half of your response makes me feel that you don’t support online businesses like ebay or craigslist which is fine, but sometimes it all comes down to saving money one way or another. In the end, you are a PR director for the NACS so you have to promote the sentiments of your organization which is fine also.
4. Thank you for your response. I appreciate being enlightened on the matter from a different perspective.
I think that to say one textbook option is ALWAYS better than another is not true; sometimes it’s much better to buy, sometimes it’s much better to rent textbooks. The key is comparison shopping.
I’m with miss Wang and E on this one. There was a time when campus bookstores were the best places for students to shop. That was ing time ago. I’ll disclose also – as a professor, I’ve been finding better shopping alternatves for my students for decades. The return to the schools is apallingly low considering the revenues.
Sorry Charles,
Anyone actually associated with USC knows how hilariously jacked up the prices are at the book store.
Good try.
Dear Ms. Wang,
Wow, that’s quite a crush you have on Amazon. Makes one wonder what would prompt such devotion. Especially to cause a busy student like yourself to sit down and take the time to write such a lengthy letter singing the praises of a corporation that you have no connection to.
I also commend you on your research. For a freshman business major, you have an uncommonly detailed knowledge of the complex textbook market and the many options available. It must have taken quite some time to get up to speed on all that.
I realze this is an opinion piece, and I have no quarrel with Amazon, nor any of the options you mention; however, I take exception to your general statement that the college store is always overpriced. You are buying into a common misperception. A Florida study found that college stores were extremely price-competitive. It found that students purchasing new college textbooks online saved an average of only $2.15 per item. In fact, online prices were HIGHER for 27 percent of the textbooks examined by the study.  
Also, did you ever stop to consider how shopping at your college store generates benefits to the local economy? College stores in the U.S. directly employ 150,000 persons, of which approximately 30,000 are students.
When a student makes a purchase from the campus store, they can be confident that a portion of that price will be returned to the campus through scholarships, paying the salaries of student workers, and supporting student activities. In fact, a 2010 survey found that college stores contribute an average of $223,691 annually to their college campuses.
A study by the Council of Smaller Enterprises states that for every $100 spent at a locally owned business, $45 stays in the local economy creating jobs and expanding the region’s tax base. The same can’t be said for money spent at the online site of a company based halfway across the country
Finally, unlike some, I will fully disclose my affiliation so my statements can be clearly judged.
— Sincerely,
Charles Schmidt, Dir. of PR

Wide receiver Thearon Collier, who transferred to USC from Miami (Fl.) in August 2010, has left the program, according to multiple media reports.
Collier sat out the past season due to NCAA transfer rules, which require players to miss an entire season when leaving for a school. A native of Florida, Collier originally arrived at USC after being dismissed from Miami by then-coach Randy Shannon for a violation team rules.
The loss of Collier comes in the aftermath of tight end Blake Ayles, who recently announced that he would be transferrng to Miami. Ayles will be reunited with former position coach Brennan Carroll.
The departures shorten USC’s current roster to just 59 scholarship players.
Under NCAA sanctions, USC is allowed to feature just 75 scholarships, including its 2011 recruiting class which is to be capped at 15.

The No. 1 Trojans were quick and decisive in proving their top ranking, winning 25-18, 25-17, and 25-20 in straight sets Wednesday against No. 12 Cal State Northridge (1-3, 0-1).
In the process, the Trojans also earned some much-needed redemption, as the Matadors ended the Trojans’ 2010 season with a four-set win in the MPSF Tournament’s first round last spring. The recent win, however, was also the first time USC has beaten Northridge in 17 matches.
Earlier in the week, USC coach Bill Ferguson continually stressed focus on the Trojan side of the net, especially in regards to honing their passing and defense.
Paired with their potent offense, this turned out to be the recipe for success.
USC dramatically outpaced the Matadors in hitting percentage (.455 to .227), blocks (5.5 to 1.0) and digs (29 to 20).
Northridge also finished with 18 service errors, compared to just eight for USC.
Freshman outside hitter Brandon Lebrock led the Matadors with 10 kills and senior libero Kaleo Baxter led the team with eight digs.
The Trojans executed Ferguson’s plan to near perfection. Northridge’s vaunted serving attack was annulled by strong passing by the Trojans, who finished with only two serve receive errors.
Behind sharp passing, senior setter Riley McKibbin exposed the aptly-named Matador defense, dishing out 27 assists that led to a .540 kill percentage.
“The middle attack in volleyball is just like running the ball up the middle in football,” Ferguson said. “If you can establish it successfully, the other parts of the game become much more open.
With most passes coming right to McKibbin, the quick middle attack became available on nearly every play.
The Trojans showcased their quick and sharp middle attack, led by seven kills from senior middle blocker Austin Zahn, followed by three kills from junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick.
Both Shandrick and Zahn hit above an astronomical .500 clip.
“We always start by attacking their middle blocker. We have two great middle blockers – two of the best in the league,” McKibbin said. “I can set them anywhere and expect them to put it away.”
This strategy worked well for the Trojans. Once the middle attack was established, McKibbin’s outside sets were often met by only one blocker at a time.
This led to opportunities for junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, who led the charge with 11 kills.
Senior opposite hitter Murphy Troy had a monstrous match, finishing with 10 kills at a .667 kill percentage, displaying a bevy of tips and tools over and around the Matador block in conjunction with his intimidating power attack.
“All the credit goes to the passers. We had great passing, which led to great sets to me and the rest of the hitters,” Troy said. “Riley could get one-on-ones all the time. At that point, putting the ball away is easy.”
Ferguson reinforced his co-captains’ benefits from a strong passing game.
“The key [to a strong middle attack] is that we’re passing the ball great,” Ferguson said. “[Freshman libero] Henry Cassiday is playing great volleyball, and Ciarelli and [sophomore outside hitter] Maddison McKibbin are passing great too.”
Cassiday finished with 13 digs in his first career conference match.
“Our technique looked good. If we prepare in the gym and come with the right tools, we can handle anything thrown our way,” Ferguson said.

Fresh off its first loss in the last seven games, the USC women’s basketball team is eager to rebound this week with home games against Oregon and Oregon State.
Driving · Junior guard Ashley Corral and USC will host OSU and  Oregon this week and attempt to keep their home winning streak alive. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
“In the Pac-10 there’s not a lot of time to sit and sulk about a loss,” junior guard Ashley Corral said. “No matter how good or bad a game is, in the next three or four days you have another to play.”
First on the docket for the Women of Troy (10-4, 2-1) is a Thursday night game against Oregon, which leads the Pac-10 in scoring at 85.3 points per game. Like their gridiron counterparts, the Ducks (11-4, 2-2) play fast and score quick, forcing opponents to match their tempo.
“[Oregon] has played 15 games this year and scored over 100 points five times,” Corral said. “We’re just running, running, running this week to prepare.”
Sophomore forward Christina Marinacci said the coaching staff’s emphasis leading up to the game has been getting back on defense.
“We just have to get back on transition,” Marinacci said. “We call them the track team of the Pac-10. They look to run and score as many points as they can, they don’t really try to stop you.”
Last season, USC took two out of three games in the series. Each team narrowly won on the other’s home court during the regular season, and the Women of Troy eked out an 80-76 victory in the opening round of the conference tournament.
The two stars from the Oregon team are gone, but a new duo has stepped in to fill their place. Junior forward Amanda Johnson leads the conference in scoring with 17.3 points per game, while redshirt junior guard Nia Jackson is close behind at 16.3 points per game.
Marinacci said the undersized Women of Troy are better equipped than most teams to slow down Johnson.
“We have post players who can run up and down the court,” she said. “I think we’ll match up with her okay. It’s just a matter of finding her in transition.”
On Saturday, the Women of Troy host Oregon State (7-8, 0-4), which finished last in the Pac-10 Conference a season ago with a 2-16 conference record. USC beat the Beavers 61-34 last year at the Galen Center.
Records and history aside, Corral said it was important for USC to not overlook the Beavers.
“We just have to worry about ourselves,” Corral said. “Whether we’re playing the No. 1 team in the nation or the worst team, it’s about us and what we have to do to get the job done.”

The green and yellow-clad fans of Eugene, Ore. are still down in the dumps just days after watching their hometown Ducks lose the BCS National Championship game in heartbreaking fashion to the Auburn Tigers on Monday night .
First to arrive · Junior forward Nikola Vucevic and USC are on the road this week to play conference opponent Oregon in their new arena. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
But just when it looked like Duck fans would have to trudge through another bleak winter in the blistering cold of the Northwest, the university’s proudest alum, Nike founder Phil Knight, once again has come to the rescue with the gift of a new home.
Tonight, when coach Kevin O’Neill and the USC men’s basketball team (10-6, 2-1) make its longest road trip during conference play, they will be greeted to the newest collegiate basketball cathedral money can buy, as Dana Altman’s underwhelming Oregon squad (7-9, 0-4) unveils the 12,000 seat Matthew Knight Arena.
“It’s going to be a lot of fun,” junior forward Nikola Vucevic said. “I mean they have been talking about this for a while. I’m glad we will be the first ones to play in it, but I just hope we get the win.”
Outside of the frenzied atmosphere that will likely come with the opening of the best gymnasium Nike could buy, the already road-tested Trojans will face a Pac-10 foe that employs more than just a high-definition scoreboard and NBA-like amenities.
Altman and Co. are avid proponents of the 1-1-3 and 2-3 zone — a strategy that worked favorably for Rider and Washington this season as they looked to stop USC’s low-post duo of senior forward Alex Stepheson (10.2 points and 9.1 rebounds per game) and Vucevic (16.1 and 9.6).
O’Neill has remained an ardent supporter of his own team’s recent ability to make stops at the defense end, however, since the Trojans have held teams to under 34 percent shooting in their last eight games — a pattern he hopes will continue Thursday night regardless of the boisterous crowd expected to fill the Knight Arena.
“The bottom line is we aren’t playing the crowd, we are playing the team out there,” O’Neill said. “We know it’s going to be a tough game and a great crowd, but we just have to go out there and play as best we can and try to get a win.”
In the Trojans’ 63-52 win against their crosstown rival, UCLA, at the Galen Center on Sunday, it was Stepheson’s effort on the offensive and defensive glass that proved to be the difference, personally recording a career-high 16 rebounds and playing without a cast on his right hand for the first time all season.
The Trojans’ senior forward will have little time to be starstruck by the grand opening of the Ducks’ new home, as he will be tasked with the challenge of stopping Oregon’s undersized senior power forward Joevan Catron.
The fifth-year senior leads the Ducks in points (15.9 per game) and rebounds (6.4 per game), while also providing the type of leadership and experience Altman and his staff have struggled to find during his first season at the helm in Eugene.
While not showing his entire hand heading into their Pac-10 road opener, O’Neill suggested that to counter Catron’s craftiness and strength around the basket, he might even utilize the Trojans’ most prized weapon and defensive stopper, senior guard Marcus Simmons.
“I am not against putting [him] on their best inside guy and then just going from there,” O’Neill said.
Thursday night’s 8 p.m. tilt also marks the beginning of a stretch in which USC will play the role of the unwanted visitor in five of their next seven games.

As the semester begins at USC, nine new signees have enrolled in spring semester classes and will suit up for spring practice.
The Trojans are not traditionally known for signing junior college transfers, but USC coach Lane Kiffin scoured the junior college ranks looking for talented players to fill in the depth chart.
“It was very apparent that we had depth issues and that we should not wait until the fall,” Kiffin told the Los Angeles Times. “We had the ability to get some guys and count them back. That’s why we did it and we think we helped ourselves.”
—
Defensive back Isiah Wiley, a transfer from Arizona Western Junior College, registered 44 tackles and three interceptions in ten games at Arizona Western J.C. Wiley is only 6-foot-1, but he is known for always being in position to make a play on the ball.
Offensive linemen David Garness and Jeremy Galten add much needed depth to the Trojans’ offensive line. Both will compete for playing time as two starters, Tyron Smith and Kristofer O’Dowd, were lost to graduation. Garness and Galten were named All-NorCal Conference first team selections in each of their two seasons playing at the junior college level.
Linebacker Dallas Kelley led Chaffey Junior College in tackling and was subsequently named to the All-Central West Conference first team. With two starting spots open, significant playing time is there for the taking if Kelley can impress coaches in spring ball.
Quarterback Cody Kessler, the 2010 Gatorade California Player of the Year has been lauded for his strong arm and mobility. As a high school senior, he threw for 2,831 yards and 36 scores, while running for eight touchdowns.
Quarterback Max Wittek, the Mater Dei graduate, threw for 2,252 yards and 24 touchdowns and ran for six scores during his senior year. Although Wittek is not as mobile as Kessler, his vision is better, and he is more of a gunslinger.
Fullback Soma Vainuku the cousin of former USC standout and current Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Rey Maualuga, was named to the Cal-Hi All-State Medium Schools first team.
Long snapper Peter McBride graduated from high school early and will be a valuable addition to John Baxter’s special teams unit. Some scouts believe McBride is ahead of the curve when it comes to long snapping technique.
Placekicker Andre Heidari, the gem of the class and ranked number one at his position by several recruiting services is known for his powerful, accurate leg. Field goals have been an adventure for the Trojans the past two seasons, as they have made just 22-of-33 attempts. Lane Kiffin was hesitant to attempt any field goal over 30 yards in 2010, but Heidari’s presence should allow USC to expand its range.

All nine players will count against USC’s scholarship total for 2010, with the 2011 class being limited by NCAA sanctions. USC is only allowed to offer fifteen scholarships, per class.
“Identifying, enticing and signing players capable of completing coursework so they can graduate early from high school or transfer mid-year from a junior college is more difficult than it appears,” Greg Biggins of ESPNRise.com told the Los Angeles Times.
“As a high school player, you basically have to know at least a year in advance so you can start stacking your [class] schedule,” he said. “And the school has to make sure kids want to do that and that their school and district will allow them to.”
Easy now, boys.  
Madrid was just pointing out that Heidari might have the most impact on the 2011 Trojans team, that’s all.  ..and that’s a good point.  Regarding the Wittek comments, I think the point was that he’s more of a true “pocket” passer – and if you watched the UA game, he was a monster.  Wittek did a great job of bringing his team back from a big deficit – something that with only a week of practice together is actually quite impressive.  Kessler great in his own right.  It should be a fun battle to watch, as both recruits have big-time potential.
Who cares if Vainuku’s accolades came from 2009?  That’s still impressive – and now he’s a year older/stronger.
Regarding the 6-1″ comment, I agree.  That’s good size for a DB.  
Peace.
Completely agree with Steve B.
Not to mention Tyron Smith was not lost to graduation, but to early departure to the NFL.  This writer needs to do a lot more work before publishing anything else.
So many statements that need commenting about in this article. First, a defensive back at 6’1 is a very decent size not only which is ridiculous. Talk to former Trojan Troy Polamalu under six feet. Next, three starters were lost on the offensive line with Reardon and Lewis sharing one Guard position the whole season. Interesting you know for a fact that Wittek’s vision is better than Kessler being an optometrist or do you realize how many interceptions Wittek had in his senior year at Mater Dei. Vainuku was a highschool senior in 2009 when he was named whatever by Cal-Hi Sports. Lastly if Heidari is the gem of the class enrolling early something is amiss here with Kessler the Gatorade California Player of the Year!

Boy, it was a sight to witness.
On display Sunday night was something reminiscent of what I’d normally see at a football game.
A sea of cardinal and gold jam-packed the entire student section and proceeded to fill the upper decks.
A raucous, standing-room-only Galen Center crowd screamed, shouted and cursed voraciously at the powder blue and gold dispersed throughout the arena.
“It was awesome to see the crowd we had,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said.
Feeding off a frenzied crowd, the Trojans used their home-court advantage to pull away down the stretch.
After it was all said and done, the USC marching band topped it all off with “Tusk,” in tune to the fans reminding everybody that UCLA just isn’t very good.
“[The] win means everything to us,” senior forward Alex Stepheson said.
The victory wasn’t just any win for USC though — this marked the fourth consecutive win over crosstown rival UCLA.
Ever since taking over the coaching job in 2009, O’Neill remains unbeaten against the Bruins.
Besides exerting its seemingly eternal dominance between the gridirons, the school more known for its football program is now flexing its muscles on the hardwood floors.
For years, the collegiate sports teams in Los Angeles were largely recognized for their success.
Travel to USC and peer into Heritage Hall graced with Heisman Trophy winners and National Championships.
If you want to talk about dominance in basketball, take a trip down to Westwood and gaze at the NCAA championship banners hanging from the rafters.
Before, USC basketball couldn’t even be mentioned in the same breath as UCLA basketball.
All of that may be changing.
“When you’ve beaten UCLA, you’ve beaten tradition,” O’Neill said following the win Sunday night.
And he’s right.
After all, UCLA’s basketball program has won 11 NCAA national championships, and they’re known for having arguably the greatest coach of all time in John Wooden.
Despite NCAA-mandated sanctions that will haunt the team until 2014, O’Neill has managed to make use of the players he has now and control what is in his hands.
The NCAA might be trying its hardest to derail us from dominating collegiate athletics, but it’s not working when it comes to beating UCLA.
They might have been able to recruit cream of the crop talent in the form of five McDonald All-Americans, guards Jerime Anderson and Malcolm Lee, center Josh Smith and forwards Travis and David Wear (who transferred from North Carolina earlier this year), but rankings don’t mean everything.
The culture of USC revolves around football, but O’Neill is changing the basketball program and, bringing it to a level where it is more than just an afterthought.
He has managed to lure guys to come play and start a winning tradition of their own. Freshman guard Maurice Jones was an unheralded prospect out of Michigan, and only recruited by a handful of smaller Division-I schools back East.
But as the floor general for a team in need of a true point guard after Mike Gerrity left, his leadership cannot be taken for granted.
Freshman guard Bryce Jones was a highly touted prospect out of local Woodland Hills Taft High and ESPN evaluators say he has the potential to be one of the best wing-type players on the West Coast.
His contributions might not have shown up in the box score, but his strong play off the bench sparked the Trojans when they needed it most.
O’Neill was even able to lure junior Jio Fontan, whose contributions cannot be overstated, from Fordham.
With him, the Trojans stand at 4-2 and without him, O’Neill believes it could easily be the other way around.
“He leads us, and he really cares about winning,” O’Neill said. “If we did not have Jio these last six games, we would be 2-4 or 1-5.”
But they’re not, and more importantly, USC is showing everybody in Los Angeles they are more than just a football school.
Currently, the Trojans are consistently beating their rivals in basketball, almost as if it were tradition.
It might have been just a rivalry game in the eyes of many, but the win and the recent success signifies a power shift.
Get used to it — the Trojans might very well be at the top of the basketball hierarchy now.

Junior tight end Blake Ayles has told teammates he will transfer, according to a report appearing on ESPNLosAngeles.com Wednesday.
Ayles has yet to comment on the matter publicly, but USC coach Lane Kiffin told reporters that he heard that Ayles was “contemplating some things” but had not been made aware of any final decision.
“That’s all I know,” Kiffin said. “I don’t know that anything’s happened.”
NCAA sanctions handed down last June permit Ayles to transfer without penalty to any non-Pac-10 school. Under normal circumstances, he would be forced to sit out the 2011 season.
Last June, six players took advantage of the exception, including defensive end Malik Jackson, who transferred to Tennessee, and linebacker Jordan Campbell, who left for Louisville.
Sources say that a possible destination for Ayles is Miami (Fla.), which recently hired former USC tight ends coach and recruiting coordinator Brennan Carroll to the same position. Carroll was one of Ayles’ primary recruiters when coming out of Orange Lutheran High School in 2007, along with quarterback Aaron Corp.
Ayles, who was originally a four-star prospect in 2008 and rated as the fifth best player overall in the state of California by Rivals.com, amassed 14 catches for 182 yards and a touchdowns in three seasons with the Trojans.
If reports are correct, Ayles will become the second player to transfer this offseason after redshirt junior defensive tackle Hebron Fangupo transferred to Brigham Young.
It might also be worth mentioning that head Douche Bag of the NCAA’s COI Paul Dee is a prominent supporter of Miami Football and this will be the second Trojan to go there since technically Sentrel “Just give me Me” Henderson asked for and was granted a release from his scholarship to go there.
Can you say conflict of interest? I would think if the NCAA really wants to appear fair and just, that members of the COI should exclude their universities from potentially gaining a recruit as a result of sanctions they levy.
Now that would go a long way in pulling their foots out of their you know whats and being “fair” and “objective”.
yeah….right. Keep dreaming.
Die Douche bag Dee, Die.

On the basketball court, USC junior guard Jio Fontan is used to success.
At powerhouse St. Anthony High School (N.J.), the Paterson, N.J. native was a three-year letterman. As a sophomore, his team went 24-2 in the regular season before bowing out to eventual New Jersey state champion St. Patrick’s in the round of 16.
Fast start · Despite not playing in the Trojans’ early season games, junior guard Jio Fontan has made a strong first impression on teammates while helping USC to a 4-2 record with him in the lineup. Fontan and the Trojans face Oregon and Oregon State in Pac-10 play this weekend. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
As a junior, the Friars went undefeated in the regular season before again falling again at the hands of St. Patrick’s, who would go on to defend their state title.
As a senior co-captain, he helped lead St. Anthony’s to another undefeated regular season, and the Friars finally avenged their losses to St. Patrick’s en-route to a 32-0 season and a state and national championship.
Five of his teammates received Division I scholarship offers to school like Rutgers, Pittsburgh and Kansas.
While not as heavily recruited, Fontan was still nationally-ranked as a point guard and considered schools such as St. John’s and George Mason, but eventually committed to play across the Hudson River at Fordham University in New York, attempting to turn around the once proud program.
Fontan found personal success immediately, leading Fordham in both scoring and assists as a freshman, and earning a spot on the Atlantic-10 All-Rookie team. But the Rams went just 3-25, and Fontan requested to be released from his scholarship. Following a 1-4 start in 2009, the school granted his release.
“I wanted to get out of Fordham,” Fontan said. “I was not happy with the situation there. I did not feel comfortable, and I did not like the direction that the program was headed in.”
It was a big risk for Fontan, who had no visits planned or transfer offers at the time of his release. He quickly found himself being recruited, however, by several major programs, including Tennessee, Miami and Alabama, but ultimately committed to the Trojans after watching them rout then-No. 9 Tennessee in December 2009.
Fontan enrolled at USC in spring 2010, but because of NCAA transfer rules was not eligible to play for a year following his transfer. Nonetheless, he reaped praise from teammates and coaches alike, especially for his court leadership.
“He’s going to lift our team up a couple more levels, just by his presence, his ability, his leadership,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill after Fontan’s transfer. “I’ve been coaching basketball for 30 years, and unless I’m completely out of my mind, he’s going to be the best leader I’ve ever coached.”
“The thing about Jio, everything he says, people listen,” said senior guard Marcus Simmons.
Since he first took the court as a Trojan, that leadership ability has clearly manifested itself.
His debut came against the No. 3 Kansas Jayhawks at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kan. where the Jayhawks had won 64 consecutive games.  Although USC ended up losing by two points, Fontan started, played 35 minutes, scored 15 points and was an integral part of the Trojans’ 14-point comeback in the second half.
Three days later, he scored 13 points in 30 minutes as the Trojans knocked off then-No. 18 Tennessee in Knoxville, Tenn.
In just his third game as a Trojan, Fontan led the team in scoring with 21 points in a win over Lehigh. In fact, he has scored double digits and played at least 30 minutes in five of his six games as a Trojan, and USC, as a result, is 4-2 in that span.
“If we did not have Jio these last six games, we would be 2-4 or 1-5,” O’Neill said.
“He is a commander on the court,” said senior forward Alex Stepheson. “He is able to guide and help the other wing players, especially the younger guys.”
Despite the accliam, Fontan is not satisfied. “I am my biggest critic,” he said. “I don’t feel I’ve played a complete game yet.”
Fontan, however, not only sees room for improvement in himself, but in the team.
“We need to do a better job playing a complete game,” he said. “At times, we take too many plays off and fall asleep on defense or take bad shots on offense. We have not hit our peak yet, and that is a beautiful thing.”
But overall, Fontan is quite happy at USC, saying the “best part about USC is the weather,” and that he even texts his dad, Jorge, back in New Jersey to compare it.
In fact, Fontan likes it so much he says he wishes his family could relocate with him to Southern California.
On the basketball side, Fontan says he is “getting more and more comfortable adjusting,” and O’Neill certainly agrees.
“He’s our glue out there,” said the second-year coach. “He leads us.”
Before arriving at USC, Fontan said his vision was “to play major minutes right away and help this team as much as possible.”
Through six games starting in the Trojans’ backcourt, there remains little doubt he’s done that.

After working for 40 years in Las Vegas, Thomas Leary was officially appointed Monday to oversee all of USC’s Capital Construction, which coordinates building and renovation used with university funds.
Experienced · Thomas Leary was appointed the new Vice President of Capital Construction and Facilities Management at USC. - Robin Laird | Daily Trojan 
Leary will also oversee Facilities Management, which maintains the buildings on both the University Park and Health Sciences Campuses.
“It’s a beautiful, beautiful campus,” Leary said. “I come from the Philadelphia area, and they have Drexel and Penn and Temple, and I can tell you now that none of those campuses are as nice as this.”
Leary will be in charge of making sure the buildings run properly in terms of heating, cooling, electricity and other safety aspects. He will also make sure that there are enough funds for earthquake remediation and overseeing the construction of new buildings.
“The complexity of running this campus and the medical campus is quite a significant responsibility,” said USC Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer Robert Abeles.
Abeles also hopes that Leary will be able to bring new ideas from his past experiences on how to run the university.
“I have certain ideas on how the design process and the construction process should be conducted,” Leary said. “I’ve seen the wrong way to do things and the right way to do things. I don’t know how they do things here — I’m just getting my feet wet.”
Leary has worked in the construction and renovation industry for about 40 years, spending the first 20 years mostly in construction and the past 20 working on the development, managing design and legal aspects of renovation and construction projects. He spent the past 12 years working for the MGM Mirage in Las Vegas, and was one of four primary project managers on the City Center, a $9 billion complex with hotels, residences, dining, shopping and spas.
“The university has significant expansion plans on both the campus here and the medical campus,” Abeles said. “He’ll be involved with those decisions and how to get those buildings built over time, because of his background, Leary will provide a different perspective on the way the University is currently operated.”
Nice! I bet USC hired him, because of the USC Village project and the up-coming take over Expo Park. Fight On!

The Lyon Center completed renovations during winter break intended to improve its facilities.
Facility maintenance has updated the floors in all of the Lyon Center’s common areas including hallways and stairwells, according to Justine Gilman, director of Recreational Facilities and Fitness.
Renovation · Students play ping pong in the upstairs hallway of the Lyon Center. The Lyon Center finished installing new flooring in the common areas including hallways and stairways over winter break. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
Gilman said the Lyon Center is currently working to replace the pool deck, which is scheduled to be finished in the middle of February.
The pool area will continue to be improved this semester as external landscaping and fencing for the pool are currently in a concept stage. The Lyon Center is also looking to redo the dive tower later this semester.
Some students, however, wish the Lyon Center focused the renovations more on the machines.
“[The flooring] doesn’t really mean a lot to me,” said Travis McLain, a sophomore majoring in interactive entertainment. “Maybe some more machines would be better because the cardio ones get really crowded.”
Dana Levin, a junior majoring in biological sciences, said she would work out at the Lyon Center if there were more machines.
“I don’t go to the Lyon Center much because its always just a bit too crowded but if they are adding in more spaces, the changes might entice me to go more often,” Levin said.
Gilman said the center is constantly trading old equipment for new equipment, but more machines are not likely to be added in the near future.
“As for adding a number of pieces, I don’t see that happening right now in terms of space,” Gilman said. “But we will continue to trade out and bring in new equipment.”
Nehi Ogbevoen, vice president of Undergraduate Student Government, said he hopes the construction will benefit students and address their past complaints about the Lyon Center.
“We kept hearing complaints from students about how the machines are broken, spaces are limited, and we are very excited about the new renovations because it will begin to address some of these needs,” Ogbevoen said.
In addition to the flooring and pool deck renovations, the Lyon Center is awaiting new digital televisions that should arrive by the end of the month, Gilman said.
“When the university went from analog to digital, 50 percent of our TVs were analog, so we are replacing the old to bring in the new digital ones,” Gilman said.
Inconveniences to students were minimal because the bulk of the renovation took place during break and the multiple rainstorms in Southern California caused only minimal delays, according to Gilman.
The Lyon Center was closed from Dec. 14 to Dec. 17 to seal the flooring, but only parts of the center were closed during the rest of the renovating process.
The construction was a collaborative effort of USG, Recreational Sports and Programs and Recreational Facilities and Fitness.
Chris Cheng, USG president, said there are a wide array of possibilities for university construction in the future.
“Now that the campus center is done, it opens up the door for new construction projects across the campus,” he said.
The Brothers of Pike thank USC for upgrading the flooring in the Lyon Center.  It was not a waste of money as many of us have soft feet.
I walked in last Thursday and found the floors replaced.  Even if facilities did it it still cost money, and a complete waste of money.  While I see the point that they are hesitant to add more machines, there is the room for it.
The facility is completely mismanaged.  Common practices that are used at commercial facilities are not employed here, such as separating weights and cardio equipment into their own areas, whereas the Lyon Center has both weights and machines both upstairs and downstairs, making people wait for cardio machines in one place where machines may be available in the other place.  
Someone really should be hired who worked at a commercial facility to take over and re-vamp the place.

The Undergraduate Student Government has been preparing for the spring semester with plans to expand its various committees, focus more heavily on collaboration between student groups and increase student involvement.
USG is continuing with a project from last semester, the Greater L.A. Initiative, aimed at providing students with transportation to locations around Los Angeles.
“This is meant for students … who aren’t local and don’t have cars, so that they can see L.A.,” Ogbevoen said.
Waleed Ishtiaq, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering, said he feels trapped within campus because he does not have a car.
“I wish I could see more of Hollywood and Malibu,” Ishtiaq said. “I feel like I’m contained just within the university.”
The next Greater L.A. Initiative event is a trip to Universal Studios City Walk on Jan. 21, which students can sign up for online. Trips to the Getty Museum, Venice Beach and the Getty Villa in Malibu are also planned for later in the semester.
“I appreciate USG trying to help students to experience L.A. because there are not a lot of things to do on campus,” said Michael Lin-Brande, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “This will give us the opportunity to see L.A. that we otherwise couldn’t.”
Liz Trower, senior director of communication for USG, said another one of USG’s primary goals this semester is to focus on growing their committees to include a wider variety of students from all across campus.
“[It’s] sort of an overall theme of what we’re doing,” she said. “What we’re trying to do is get students more involved [in USG decisions] by getting more committee members that represent different interests across campus, and then try to get directors to use those committees to cross boundaries.”
USG committee membership saw an increase of almost 100 students last fall. USG officials hope to see comparable membership increase this semester, Trower said.
With this additional membership, committees will look to step up their work on joint projects.
USG President Chris Cheng said lack of collaboration between campus sources can make getting things accomplished difficult.
“Collaboration is key,” he said. “[I’ve] learned in this job that this university is too decentralized.”
USG’s focus on collaboration will therefore move beyond the organization itself, and will include elements throughout campus.
As a first step toward meeting those goals, USG will host its third-annual Council of Presidents meeting Feb. 2, where the leaders of all campus organizations will be invited to collaborate with those whom they might not otherwise interact.
This year, however, Trower said USG will be taking a slightly different approach.
“Last year it was about what USG is as an organization,” she said. “This year, it’s about how we can connect, and what USG can do for student groups to increase funding and other opportunities.”
Lauren Mills, co-executive director of Troy Camp, who will be attending the meeting, said she is looking forward to forming a relationship with members of USG.
“I think that Troy Camp has strong support from USG, but communication between the two doesn’t really happen unless it’s about money,” Mills said. “It will be nice to get to know the people you ask for money from.”
Good work USG!

Newly inaugurated Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget proposal includes plans to slash more than $1 billion from California’s public higher education system, which has long been considered a model for other states.
Brown promised during his campaign to tackle California’s mounting debt and enforce state fiscal responsibility. In his inaugural address on January 3, Brown emphasized the necessity of budget cuts for the recovery of California’s economy.

The proposed budget would cut $500 million from the University of California and the both California State University systems and $400 million from the state’s community colleges.
Ann Crigler, USC professor of political science, said the cuts to higher education will challenge the ability of state universities to award financial aid and attract esteemed faculty, something that could actually benefit a private university like USC.
“There are ramifications for the number of dollars [those schools] are going to receive for financial aid,” Crigler said. “If faculty in the UC and CSU systems are not getting support in research and salary, then it will be easier for USC to attract the best faculty.”
Although USC is a private university, the budget cuts will still affect the USC community, according to Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
“Students are still residents of California and would end up dealing with budget cuts in a whole range of areas,” said Schnur.
One key way the cuts will affect USC is by decreasing the number of potential transfer students entering the university. As community colleges face overcrowding problems, it is becoming difficult for potential transfer students to find space in the classes they need to apply to USC.
“If our community colleges sustain reductions of this magnitude, we anticipate up to 350,000 students will be turned away next year,” said California Community Colleges Chancellor Jack Scott in a media statement.
In 2010, USC received a total of 9,590 transfer applications, 59 percent of which came from California community colleges and 10 percent from CSU and UC schools.
The state budget cuts are expected to total $12.5 billion and include a 10 percent decrease in state salaries, as well as a $1.5 billion slash in welfare. A final budget solution will be decided on later in the spring.
