Since 2014’s teenage-grunge Tumblr era, Halsey has been releasing albums that emanate the loneliness of growing up in today’s young generation. Her BADLANDS’ track “New Americana” explored dependency on “cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles” while her more recent hit “Walls Could Talk” reminisces toxic love and everlasting youth. 
Halsey’s newest album, “If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power,” employs emotive lyricism to stab at loneliness and emotional struggle –– this time in an entirely new way. The album is released alongside an IMAX film produced by Trent Rozner and Atticus Ross, known for their production of “Nine Inch Nails.” 
Reznor and Ross’s unique production, characterized by sirens to screams, fill the EP with texture and layers. Their work co-writing each song and creating such a serious project compliments Halsey’s growth as a songwriter while pushing her vocally out of the traditional pop atmosphere.
“If I Can’t Have Love” has no singles or features, instead focusing on creating an eerily emotional space emphasizing “the joys and horrors of pregnancy and childbirth.” The album’s cover art, featuring Halsey in a Schiaparelli dress while breastfeeding, conveys Halsey’s sentiments surrounding her relationship with her body during this period of her life. The art was unveiled at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the dress was designed by ​​Daniel Roseberry. The gown’s luxe sequin bodice and silk wrap skirt are central to Halsey’s effort to communicate the oneness of her sexuality and identity as a mother.
“The idea that me as a sexual being and my body as a vessel and gift to my child are two concepts that can co-exist peacefully and powerfully,” Halsey said in an Instagram post.
The contents of the album itself carry the grand gestures to loneliness and emotional struggle we have seen previously from Halsey. Her opening track, “The Tradition,” is made up of slow distant piano, melodic tunes and odes to a lonely girl whose “fear will eat her alive.” By the third track, there is already a major shift present. “Easier than Lying” reverberates around the room with intense guitar chords, yelling and heavy drum beats which change the song’s energy entirely. This EP uses an infusion of different genre elements – from icy gothic tones to heavier rock elements, the album’s dark production and hard tone shifts illustrate the turbulence of emotions that accompany pregnancy. 
Tracks “Lilith” and “honey” maintain the electric pop-elements of some of Halsey’s earlier work. “honey,” an ode to a previous love, features precise and funny lyrics set against an empowering drum beat. 
“But she’s hell in a basket, just makin’ a racket / I love every second, it’s fuckin’ fantastic,” Halsey sings, yearning for the thrill of her old lover with these lyrics. The track’s formula draws upon the elements of earlier hit pop tracks like “New Americana” and “Colors.”
The entirety of their EP touches on universal themes of love, despair, power and the complications of how one views oneself — allowing this album to enter new territories beyond Halsey’s former angsty teenage ballads.
“Sabotage the things you love the most,” Halsey says in “Whispers.” “Camouflage so you can feed the lie that you’re composed.”
Her lyrics reflect human tendencies of self-sabotage and hiding personal struggle. On the other hand, her work on “I am not a woman, I’m a god” results in an anthem marked by the duality of both self-love and self-worship. In one chorus, they reference themself to be a “God,” “problem,” and “fraud”, bringing light to the common tendency to simultaneously love and hate parts of one’s nature.
It is no doubt that the versatility of the album has allowed Halsey to trek down new paths beyond traditional pop. Although each single provides interesting depth, the highlight of their musical transition can be seen in “Girl is a Gun,” which heavily pulls on guitar, drum, pop-punk and throwback-rock elements to create a skittering uniqueness that preaches power and independence. 
As Halsey jumps between love, hate and confusion, one thing is for sure –– she has created an emotional space in which listeners can feel less alone in their personal struggle. They may not have provided the secrets to managing pregnancy or the internal duality of love and hatred, but by processing their own trials and tribulations surrounding love and motherhood, they fill the album with power and understanding. The final track, “Ya’aburnee,” brings closure to both the album and listener as Halsey melodically sings of finding immortality through a child’s love. 
“You know I swear I’d give you anything,” she sings to her one-month-old child Ender Aydin. “And I think we could live forever / In each other’s faces ‘cause I’ll / Always see my youth in you.”

In the first episode of “You” Season Two, Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) moves to Los Angeles to escape from his past after murdering his  prior love-interest Beck (Elizabeth Lail). To Goldberg, L.A. — with all its perceived insincerity and superficial focus on illusions and appearances — is a nightmare, particularly for someone who believes in his own genuine goodness above all else. At the very beginning of this episode, Goldberg walks past an Instagram-worthy wall, where a group of influencers are busy hosting livestreams and posing for social media photos. 
“I’m here for the moment where everyone is too into themselves to connect with another person,” Goldberg says in a voiceover. “It’s the worst city in the world and the last place I wanna be, and that’s perfect.” 
Those words stuck with me for a long time, mostly because of their irony. “You,” which tells the story of Goldberg and the lengths he goes to for his obsessions, is about the delusional, dangerous side of dreams. Even as he criticizes the shallowness of what appears as dominant L.A. culture, Goldberg is obsessed with crafting who he is within his own love story. When Goldberg falls in “love” again, this time with Love (Victoria Pedretti), he might not be an influencer curating a social media feed, but he curates his own identity to justify his pattern of killing and behavior. All of this is done to maintain his idealistic dream of romance. 
In a twisted way, his pattern of behavior is his “influence.” That’s part of what makes “You” as a television show so subversive. The story, especially with Season Two’s L.A. setting, is willing to engage with ideas so crucial to romantic imagination. After distorting these images, it then asks: are these actions, are these people, really what they present themselves to be, or is this only a performance? 
At the very end, when Goldberg discovers that Love isn’t who he thought she was, he attempts to kill her. It’s an immediate shun that others have written about for its important reflection of his narrative arc. He is so unwilling to see beyond the image that he doesn’t realize he has anyone other than himself to blame. Goldberg’s too into himself, too intent on preserving his vision and imagining his role in it. He never truly understands that illusions are only a slightly more romantic term for lies. 
Watching “You,” I couldn’t help but think about the idea of illusions as driving forces. It’s in the digital presence that I focused on curating in high school. It’s in college, where I find myself still wanting to “perform” a certain way to others and to be seen as a “cool” person. It’s especially prevalent coming to USC, where I can’t help feeling inferior for not conforming to USC stereotypes, not looking the way I’d like to or not being extroverted enough. 
These sentiments brought me to the backdrop for which this preoccupation with image and illusion all occurs: L.A. In many ways, that was the catalyst for this column. I wanted to write “Reel LA” because as a USC student, I’m interested in Los Angeles, specifically how this contemporary city is cinematically represented in the cultural imagination. As a student majoring in narrative studies and minoring in cinematic arts, I also know how important exposition is on a visual level. 
“Reel LA” intends to analyze the L.A. imaginary in our own imaginations, but it’s also about discovering what’s real, or “reel.” I want to examine the city specifically in relation to the dichotomy of illusions and reality. I hope that we can use that framework to critically look at our own identities and experiences as USC students in L.A., and more importantly, just as human beings. In the process of watching how L.A. culture explicitly and implicitly parallels the decisions of fictional characters, I hope that we can think of ourselves as characters in our own stories. 
That’s what I think is so powerful about film, television and visual culture as a whole — the self-referential awareness that you’re consuming the world around you, but only through a certain lens. At some point, you might watch a movie like “La La Land’’ about L.A. as a city of dreams. At the same time, you buy into those dreams while watching the characters that chase after them. You look for that idealized version of the city. You consume these personas knowing that they’re fiction, and yet you crave them. Sometimes you love them not in spite of, but because they represent an unattainable reality. 
It’s a story that “You” tells, albeit through a psychological thriller that implicitly deals with themes of power and performance. The core of “You” is about Goldberg, who embodies the essence of L.A. even as he denies it. It’s about how Goldberg, like the culture around him, is obsessed with ideas of people. He’s obsessed with what they represent for him. 
Consuming his fiction means that Goldberg can freely imagine the world around him on his own terms. It means performing an imagination where the only audience is yourself. I believe it’s a sentiment all too apt in the city of dreams — loving images for the “realities” they represent, and not the myths that they are.

In an era where social media stars are invited to the Met Gala, it’s natural for their next conquest to be the silver screen. “He’s All That” — a remake of the 1999 rom-com “She’s All That” — starring TikTok darling Addison Rae released Aug. 27 on Netflix. The film focuses on Padgett Sawyer, a beauty influencer specializing in makeovers. When her famous boyfriend cheats on her and her ensuing breakdown is broadcasted live on social media, Padgett loses all her brand deals and must find a way to get the money back so she can afford to go to university. Capitalizing on the fame garnered from her makeover content, Padgett tries to transform unpopular classmate Tanner Buchanan into prom king in order to regain the followers she lost. The film opens with Padgett maintaining her perfect influencer façade. She wakes up twice – once to make herself presentable for her followers: brushing her teeth, fixing her hair and applying makeup, and again to document her “real morning routine.” 
These critiques of influencer culture are present from the beginning. Mark Waters, director of the film, satirizes the unattainable lifestyle and image influencers show their followers and fans — and it’s all the more ironic when the influencer is played by social media aficionado Rae. 
Kourtney Kardashian appears in a minor role as an owner of a brand that sponsors Padgett. It’s actually a really fun addition to the film, though underutilized. Hearing Kardashian’s Californian accent and monotone speech is enough to elicit a giggle out of anyone. 
Former “Girl Meets World” star Peyton Meyer stars as Padgett’s sleazy boyfriend Jordan Van Draanen (AKA JVD). JVD becomes a caricature — a critique of the ease of fame during the age of social media. While clearly untalented, he remains loved for reasons no one can really determine. Even in the face of Padgett’s live-streamed breakdown where anyone watching can clearly see JVD is at fault for cheating on her, he still manages to frame himself as the victim. 
JVD’s one and only single, which has somehow garnered him hundreds of thousands of followers, consists mostly of the words “La La La.” (He sings it at every opportunity — even karaoke.) Padgett scathingly insults the song where he recounts his “difficult” childhood. “Oh, and by the way,” Padgett says, “There are no mean streets of Pali. You live on the same block as Gwyneth Paltrow.”
Toward the end of the film the critique is more glaring and borders on cheesy. In the typical Mark-Waters-Mean-Girls-Esque scene where the female lead wins prom queen and forfeits the crown to get with the male love interest, Padgett gives a surface-level speech about the perils of being fake on social media. She shares photos of “the real her” — featuring her actually waking up and one where she has a pimple — oh the horror. “For the last four years, I’ve been so busy selling myself on social media, putting out this image of who I wanted people to think I am,” Padgett says “This perfect person with perfect makeup, perfect clothes, perfect grades, the perfect boyfriend.”
With a TV-14 rating the message could land for middle schoolers to maybe sophomores in high school, but for any viewer older than that it’s a bit too shallow. As a reboot, the film inevitably invites comparison to the original. In a virtual college roundtable promoting the film attended by the Daily Trojan, Buchanan spoke about how the original influenced how he performed his role. 
“It’s trying your best to make sure that anybody that [is a fan] of the original are going to be happy with it and understand that maybe it’s not the same exact character,” Buchanan said. “So it did influence [it a lot]. But not at all, if that makes sense.”
“[It’s] like how can I make this movie almost make you feel the same way, but not by doing everything they’re doing in that movie,” Rae said.
Other than the critique of microcelebrity and social media, the acting is adequate. The performances are not spectacular, but none are so terrible they take you out of the film. Even Rae in her first film role demonstrates promise. She described her experiences seeking out acting coaches and doing script analysis to help her prepare for the role.
“I auditioned, did some self-tapes, did many self-tapes, actually, many, many, many, probably, like 10 different versions, just like of different scenes and just seeing how well it [fit],” Rae said. 
Tanner Buchanan’s rendition of the unpopular makeover subject Cameron Kweller is moderately better. However, Kweller’s portrayal is still the stereotypically edgy, jaded above-it-all Jughead Jones-esque kind of character that toes the line between arrogant and charming. 
The harshest disruption of the film is the brazen and obnoxious product placement — just how many times do we need to see an EOS product to know they were financially involved in the film? Other brands are heavily featured with a character blatantly asking “Can I get some KFC to go?” 
Other low points include random dance breaks and singing numbers. Rae performs a decent rendition of “Teenage Dream” by Katy Perry along with Buchanan but it feels unnecessary to the story. The randomly added dance competition before the prom scene is too long and another superfluous addition. It seemed like a bid to include some kind of acknowledgment of Rae’s dancing history and ability rather than to contribute anything useful to the plot. 
Overall, if you suspend your latent superiority complex and watch it like a middle schooler with 10 hours worth of daily TikTok screen time, it’s a pretty enjoyable film.

Women’s soccer lost their second straight game Thursday. BYU defeated the Trojans 2-1 in a dominant performance that left little room for USC to make a comeback.
Following their defeat, the Trojans finally found their way into the win column against Utah Valley Saturday. In a 4-2 victory, the Trojans held the lead for the majority of the game. Junior midfielder Croix Bethune, redshirt senior midfielder Savannah DeMelo, freshman midfielder Aaliyah Farmer and freshman forward Simone Jackson all scored in USC’s first victory of the season.  
Against BYU, the Trojans fell behind early in the 13th minute. Behind the play of sophomore forward Brecken Mozingo, who tallied a goal and an assist in the game. Mozingo’s left-footed shot lasered into the back of the net before USC senior goalkeeper Anna Smith could save it. 
BYU secured a 2-0 halftime lead by way of sophomore forward Bella Folino’s header off of a cross from Mozingo.
Senior midfielder Mikayla Colohan and freshman midfielder Olivia Smith contributed on defense for a BYU team that allowed eight shots for the Trojans in the first half. 
The game could have gotten even more out of hand in the 33rd minute, when a handball call resulted in a penalty kick for BYU, which was later saved by Smith. Despite allowing a pair of goals, Smith ended the game with five saves. 
USC appeared to have potentially turned things around early in the second half, with several more on-target shots. However, BYU’s defense and goalkeeping continued to pull through for the Cougars. With speed, aggression and precision, the BYU backline effectively countered each USC possession. 
In the 84th minute, BYU was penalized for a handball in their own penalty box, resulting in a penalty kick for Bethune. 
Bethune, who spent her freshman season recovering from an ACL injury, beat the keeper and put USC on the board. In fact, Bethune’s late-game score was the first of the season for USC, whose offense has struggled in each of its games. 
Toward the end of the game, redshirt senior forward Jada Talley had multiple shots on target, including one in the 87th minute that would have completed a comeback for the Trojans. 
The loss dropped USC’s record to 0-2-0, with both games against non-Power 5 conference teams. With other Pac-12 teams such as No. 4 UCLA and No. 13 Stanford, the Trojans could be in for a long season if they are unable to solve their offensive and defensive woes. 
USC has not started a season 0-2-0 since 2011, when they went 7-13-0. While both No. 24 BYU and No. 8 Pepperdine are Top 25 teams in the country, USC will continue to face tough opponents. With games against No. 18 Michigan and Western Michigan on the horizon, the Trojans should have plenty of opportunities to fine-tune their offense before the Pac-12 schedule begins. 
USC’s next game is Sept. 4 at 4:00 p.m. at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich.

Women’s volleyball won two of their three games in the Trojan Invitational this weekend after dropping a heartbreaker to the University of Denver in the season opener Friday. 
The Trojans fought through five sets but ultimately lost by a score of 26-24, 15-25, 25-20, 22-25 and 15-11. The Pioneers also defeated Cal State University, Northridge 3-0 earlier that day.
The Trojans easily won the second set of Friday’s game but were handled in the third and fifth sets, sealing an upset victory for Denver. The Pioneers went 14-3 last season and clearly have not lost a step. Denver also swept Campbell University, sealing a perfect 3-0 record for the Pioneers in the Trojan Invitational. 
“I think we were just kind of [at] a loss the entire night, just always trying to find rhythm that never seemed to be there,” head coach Brad Keller said after the loss. “I think that we played tentative[ly] tonight, and I actually think that that’s because we didn’t [prepare] them well enough as a coaching staff. We did not get them ready for what this actually was, and that’s on us.”
This was USC’s first game with fans in Galen Center since Nov. 29, 2019, when the Trojans lost to UCLA to close out the regular season. The atmosphere of the crowd made an impact on graduate senior captain and outside hitter Brooke Botkin. 
“We were scared, and we should have beat them. That’s the bottom line,” Botkin said after the game against Denver. “This is the first time we’ve played in front of a crowd [since 2019]. I haven’t had that much loudness around me in almost the entire year. I think we kind of broke down fundamentally. We just started to play scramble volleyball, and we were just nervous to lose instead of wanting to beat them.”
Botkin played well against the Pioneers, tallying 13 kills and 7 digs. Junior opposite hitter Emilia Weske led the team in kills with 19, but it wasn’t enough to earn the win.
Despite the tough loss to Denver, the Trojans rallied the following day and swept both Campbell and CSUN 3-0, ending the tournament with a 2-1 record. Botkin led the team in kills in both games.
“As a leader, I just want to [set by example], so I want to go out there and give it my 100%,” Botkin said. “This match was a huge a learning curve. We go back, we watch film, we break down everything we did wrong [and] what we can do better at, and that should motivate us.”
After opening play this weekend, Keller is optimistic about his team’s potential and is excited to watch them develop as players throughout the season.
 “I think we’re only scratching the surface of what this team can do,’’ Keller said. “If we can get there mentally and [if] we [can] understand how tough it’sreally going to be and the barrage of stuff that we’re going to have to go through, then I think that this team can actually do some pretty great things. We have a deep bench this time.”
The Trojans will now prepare to face Northern Iowa, Creighton and defending national champion No. 3 ranked Kentucky in the Bluegrass Battle next weekend in Lexington, Ky. 
Play will begin against the Panthers on Friday at 7:30 a.m., which will be followed by a matchup against the Blue Jays at 2 p.m. Both games can be streamed on ESPN3. The marquee matchup against No. 3 Kentucky will tip off Saturday at 4:30 p.m. and will air on SEC Network Plus.

With in-person classes beginning last Monday, USC’s schools began adhering to University and county coronavirus guidelines as well as taking school-specific precautions. 
Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences
Last Wednesday, Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Dean Amber Miller and College Dean of Undergraduate Education Emily Hodgson Anderson sent an email to all Dornsife students about the coronavirus pandemic protocols set for the upcoming school year. With over 95% of Dornsife faculty and staff already vaccinated, the message informed students that masking will be required indoors and outdoors to follow county guidelines. Students who wish to eat or drink must step outside the classroom. 
The letter also informed students of upgrades to facilities and classrooms that follow USC Environmental Health and Safety guidelines, which follow the protocols of the California Division of Occupational Safety and Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. 
Students who wish to seek further information can visit the FAQ section of the COVID-19 Resource Center website. They are encouraged to seek emotional and mental support from a team of school-specific embedded counselors.
School of Architecture 
The Daily Trojan reached out multiple times for comment on any recent updates regarding coronavirus protocols but did not hear back in time for publication. 
Any coronavirus news from the School of Architecture can be found on the “COVID-19 Information and Updates” section of their website, which was last updated in December 2020.
Roski School of Art and Design
The Roski School of Art and Design intends to follow the same coronavirus protocols as mentioned in a letter sent out by Dean Haven Lin-Kirk on Aug. 11. 
The letter specified a series of “enhancement projects” in response to the ongoing pandemic, which includes renovations to Watt Hall, such as better ventilation systems and touchless faucets. Canopies that provide outdoor venues aim to reduce classroom densities and provide places for students to “hang out.” 
Like other schools, Roski hostsin-person, hybrid and online courses. The status of each course can be found on the Schedule of Classes.  
Iovine and Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation
The Daily Trojan reached out for comments on any recent updates regarding coronavirus protocols but did not receive a statement in time for publication. 
Marshall School of Business
The Marshall School of Business does not have any new updates according to Matthew Simmons, senior manager of media relations and executive communications at Marshall. On July 28, Marshall’s Vice Dean for Undergraduate Programs Ramandeep Randhawa sent an email informing students that Marshall and, the Leventhal School of Accounting, expected to offer all of their courses in-person, with some exceptions for students who needed specific accommodations, such as medical needs or the inability to travel abroad.
Students determined to be “medically unsafe” need to immediately contact USC’s Office of Student Accessibility Services and notify their instructors with an accommodation letter from the office. International students unable to enter the United States needed to complete a petition in order to obtain accommodations for their Marshall and Leventhal classes. 
The letter noted that the accommodations listed are “Marshall-provided” and may not apply to “non-Marshall classes” in students’ schedules. 
School of Cinematic Arts
The Daily Trojan reached out for comment on any recent updates regarding coronavirus protocols but did not receive any statement in time for publication. The last updated notification from the School of Cinematic Arts came from an SCA Human Resources webpage released on April 21, informing staff of the preparations being made in response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
While noting the unpredictability of the pandemic, the webpage read that the official SCA website will include an FAQ section about the school’s coronavirus protocols. The webpage also provided a link to vaccination information and noted the creation of the University’s Remote Work Team Force that will help set up the “parameters” of doing remote work. 
Changes made to the SCA area include updates to the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system to allow air filtration, as well as reconfiguring classroom and theater settings to allow for social distancing. Theaters will have signs placed on seats to indicate six feet of social distancing and rooms will have furniture moved to allow for a more spacious environment. Common areas will follow similar guidelines and will have hand sanitizing stations.
Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism 
The Daily Trojan reached out for a comment on any recent updates regarding coronavirus protocols and was redirected to the central communications of the University.
Glorya Kaufman School of Dance
In a statement provided to the Daily Trojan on Aug. 10, Cecile Oreste, head of communications at the Kaufman School of Dance, said that Kaufman students would have in-person courses and be required to follow the mask mandates set by county guidelines. 
However, according to Dean Robert Cutietta, there has been some difficulty with students and faculty needing to wear masks. 
“We are just following the regular guidelines,” Cutietta said. “We are indoors but it’s really uncomfortable for our dancers. Imagine trying to dance or teach dance in a mask. It’s really hard but that’s what we’re doing. We’re just following the rigid guidelines.”
Cutietta said that if any student or faculty member tests positive for the coronavirus, they are required to follow the University’s procedures, which follow the CDC guidelines of quarantining for at least 10 days away from others. In terms of making accommodations for international students, he said that there is little issue.
“We have very few international students in the Kaufman school,” Cutietta said. “Fortunately, they have been vaccinated and they’re back so we haven’t had a problem there.”          
School of Dramatic Arts
In an interview with the Daily Trojan on Aug. 11, the Vice Dean of the School of Dramatic Arts, Lori Ray Fisher, said that they would work closely with the University to ensure a proper following of school and county guidelines. In order to comply with guidelines and ensure that the performing aspect of the school is kept, students and faculty will have the opportunity to utilize clear masks. 
“[Students will] have approximately two to three clear masks to start the semester and this will help with their ability for their faculty to see their faces when they act, whether they’re in a voice class, whether they have rehearsal, whatever those protocols are,” Fisher said. “They will be masked indoors.”
Fisher also said that supplemental teaching material and meeting spaces have been provided alongside four additional outdoor tents for the purposes of providing more space. She said that SDA staff will serve as coronavirus compliance officers who will be conducting a presentation for faculty and students about coronavirus classroom protocols.
However, the school currently has no restriction on the number of students entering a classroom. 
“We’re following the University guidelines and the University guidelines says that there are no density rules that are set in classes,” Fisher said. “If a class has a capacity of 15 to 20 students, then we’re able to put 15 to 20 students in that class, and the guideline and the rule requires those students to wear masks.”
Like other colleges, SDA’s physical building has been adjusted with new ventilation systems, such as the implementation of MERV 13 air filters. 
Courses in SDA have the option to switch to a “hybrid modality” in the case of specific scenarios, such as if a student tests positive for the coronavirus, Fisher said. She also discussed the ability to be flexible with Zoom sessions, especially for camera courses. 
“We’ve talked about students who are international who may not be able to make it into the country,” Fisher said. “We’ve worked with our advising office to determine how those students can stay on track curricularly, so we’re prepared to offer one of our incoming freshman acting classes online should our incoming freshman class have international students that are not able to secure the visas to get here.”
Students with disabilities will be accommodated as well. SDA will look toward the Office of Student Accessibility Services and serve these students accordingly. 
Viterbi School of Engineering
In an email sent out to students on July 20, Dean Yannis Yortsos announced that most of the Viterbi School of Engineering’s courses will be held in a hybrid format due to the “challenges and barriers” faced by students who cannot attend in-person classes because of travel restrictions or medical needs. However, in an interview with the Daily Trojan, Yortsos clarified that no courses will be offered completely online except in very special circumstances, such as courses with doctorate students.
“[I] just want to make sure that it’s very clearly understood that students who want to take their classes on campus, they will be able to take the class on campus,” Yortsos said. “There will be no courses offered by a faculty who are teaching remotely, except over very special rare cases.”
Yortsos further encouraged students who may need to take a lab course to take such a course on campus since he believes that the “the lab experience is best obtained in-person.”
Leonard Davis School of Gerontology 
The Daily Trojan reached out for recent updates regarding the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology’s coronavirus protocols but did not receive a response in time for publication.
Thornton School of Music
The Thornton School of Music began the in-person semester with its students playing outdoors. Thornton Dean Robert Cuttieta said that the situation stems from county guidelines inhibiting music students from being able to make music indoors. 
“We have a very unusual situation that’s unique on campus,” Cuttieta said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Our students produce aerosols when they play an instrument, when they sing, and the county guidelines are very unclear on what that means but [those guidelines] say that we can’t perform indoors.”
As a result, Thornton created and placed temporary stages all over the University Park campus, such as outside the Hancock Foundation Building and the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance building. Traditional classroom lectures, however, are not as bound by the guidelines as performance courses are, and are allowed to be taught indoors.
Cutietta, supported by the University’s Provost Office, has appealed to L.A. County to allow for changes to the guidelines that would allow students to perform indoors. If the guidelines do change, Cutietta intends to alter the setting.
“We will instantly move inside because we don’t want to be outside. We know it’s going to be disruptive to other people trying to learn,” Cutietta said. “Our halls are perfectly designed for acoustics and our Symphony Hall was designed so that when you’re playing in the orchestra, you can hear yourself, you can hear everything.”
Gould School of Law 
The Daily Trojan reached out to the Gould School of Law for recent updates but did not receive any statement in time for publication. 
The last update provided by the Gould School of Law comes from a letter sent out to students on Aug. 9 informing them that they would need to comply with University policy, including ensuring they complete Trojan Check and screening each student before they enter the building. 
The same letter asks students who need certain accommodations to reach out to the University’s Office of Student Accessibility Services. Furthermore, employees who need accommodations must reach out to the law school personnel office. 
The Gould School of Law building previously allowed entries and exits from the north entrance located in the Ackerman Courtroom. However, Gould now allows for students and staff to use both the north and west entrances of the building. 
School of Pharmacy 
The Daily Trojan reached out to the USC School of Pharmacy for recent updates but did not receive a statement in time for publication. 
Sol Price School of Public Policy
The Daily Trojan reached out to the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy but did not receive a statement in time for publication. 
Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry
The Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC has established that it will apply the University guidelines for both students and employees, such as completing Trojan Check daily. The east side of the dental school building is reserved for students and employees to enter or exit, while the west side is reserved for patients. Patients must be screened for coronavirus symptoms between 24 to 48 hours before their procedures. Patient screenings also occur at the door. 
Mask mandates apply to anyone who enters the building. Those who treat patients, though, upgrade their safety attire when coming into contact with patients.
“We’re a healthcare facility so everybody has to wear a mask at all times while in the building,” said Chief Health Officer Joyce Galligan. “It’s at least a surgical mask when they’re in the building, but when they’re treating patients, everybody has to wear an N95 mask as well as a face shield, head cover, shoe covers, gown and gloves.”
Both students and employees are required to take training courses before entering the dental school. Alongside the Trojan Learn mandatory training, students and employees need to complete Herman Ostrow mandatory training that can be accessed on the dental school’s intranet. 
While some classes are hybrid and online, the dental school continues to teach in-person for students to gain hands-on experience. Originally closed down for two weeks back in March 2020, the dental center eventually opened back up for patient care.

Ah yes — the sweet smell of “Back to School” in the air. 
Parents profusely sweating while helping their kids move in. Goodbyes to family and hellos to new friends. Dad installing a handicap shower head while Mom battles insurance over the phone. Two cartfuls of medicine rolled into an open corner. Carefully transporting temperature-sensitive ketamine lozenges while a nurse named Brian schedules you for in-dorm infusions and transferring 20-plus prescriptions to the student pharmacy.
Oh sorry — your back to school doesn’t look like that? Yeah, I never thought mine would either. 
For some background, this is my second big move to college. My first move was across the country in 2016 when I was 18, able-bodied and not living with chronic illness. This time around — after a three-year medical leave of absence — I’m 23 and moving to a new college with a host of chronic health conditions and certainly not as able-bodied as my 18-year-old self.
In 2016, I had eager butterflies about moving in. This time, I had a nervous knot in my gut which made me nauseous.
In preparation for move-in at USC, I vigorously planned. For weeks, I coordinated to ensure I stocked up on all my regular, emergency and refrigerated medications, IV therapies, physical therapy tools and more. 
Oh yeah, and don’t forget all the other shit you need for school like a backpack, pens, books, chargers, glasses and more.
In all honesty, it was genuinely hard to get excited for my triumphant return to college. Everyone who cared about me and their mother was excited for me, so why couldn’t I flip a switch and feel as excited as they did? I was on the precipice of something amazing, right? And lest I forget my deep anxiety over the ever-presence of the coronavirus as it continues to take its toll.
Instead, I felt like I was returning to college in a new body, dragging all my trauma from the past three years behind me like another heavy back-to-school suitcase. 
I was so desperate I even genuinely tried to enjoy the back-to-school Target commercials which usually felt like nails on a chalkboard. 
All that said, I wasn’t surprised when I cried four times on the third day of move-in. It felt like my disability was standing in my way of experiencing all the hype. I was here physically, but I wasn’t here mentally. 
Or maybe I just didn’t want to be present because that meant I had to acknowledge and accept that I was finally taking a chance with my health. 
It took three long, painful and complex years to have crafted a delicate and manageable health plan. Now, I’d have to trust all the work I’d done — all the lessons I’d learned, obstacles I’d overcome, suffering I’d endured, compensatory strategies I’d developed — to start working toward my goals which had taken a backseat during this medically necessary pause in my life. 
Amid all the tears, I reached out to my support system and was gently reminded of a few things:
And as I write this through tears again (you’re welcome to join me) in a moment of catharsis, I feel as if I can see clearly now that the time has come to pivot from surviving to thriving. 
I’m also weepy because I know I’m not alone. We’ve all gone through so much trauma — collective and individual — in the past 18 months that in all my feelings of uncertainty, I know I do not walk alone in struggling with this transition, regardless of able-bodiedness. 
So to the people I’ve met so far who’ve embraced all parts of me — including my need to rest every little bit — thank you. 
To the people I’ve yet to meet who are feeling the same way: Girl, I see you and I can’t wait to meet you.
And even if you aren’t struggling and you’re able to feel all the excitement of returning to campus, I extend a massive thank you because feeling your energy lifts me and everyone up around you. Your joy is contagious.
Most of all, to the people who got me to this point — the ones who reminded me that although I haven’t used my wings in this way in a while, it doesn’t mean they’re not ready and ripe for flying — I thank you from the depths of my heart. 
So if you’re like me, and you’re feeling like you’re taking a big chance right now, I invite you to join me in taking the first step, because then at least we’ll all be walking forward together.

Harvard is one of the most prestigious universities in the United States. It is also one of the most difficult and competitive to be accepted into. 
However, Harvard graduates often leave with significant amounts of debt, owing $1.2 billion in total. Yale students owe approximately $760 million, while students at the University of Pennsylvania are $2.1 billion in debt. 
The most frustrating part is that such universities have the funds to provide financial relief to their students. Harvard’s endowment is nearly $41 billion; for Yale and UPenn, it is over $30 billion and $14.5 billion, respectively. 
Rich, elite universities are taking advantage of their tax-exempt status, receiving billions of dollars in funding from the government but failing to utilize the revenue for academia and student services. 
Schools such as Harvard and Yale receive millions in research money from the federal government by being tax-exempt. Additionally, many higher-education institutions seek endowments — financial assistance from the government or outside sources to generate income to support budgets and fiscal stability. 
However, many of them are using this wealth to pay professors more, construct new buildings and facilities and add new bureaucracies of administrators. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the employment of postsecondary education administrators will grow 4% from 2019-2029, which is the fastest average growth rate increase for all occupations. 
For example, student enrollment in the University of California system increased by 38% in 2015, but managers and administrators more than doubled. Additionally, the UC Board of Regents gave a 3% pay raise to some of UC’s highest-paid employees. 
All of this occurred despite the student debt crisis. From 2015-2019, student loan debt grew almost 6% per year; today, the rate has more than doubled. 
Endowment money is going to administrators and construction when it should be alleviating the student debt crisis. According to one research study, out of the 67 wealthiest, private, nonprofit universities, 35 of them spent less than 5% of their endowment in 2013. If those schools ticked up their spending to equal 5%, they could fund the tuition of 2,376 students from families making $30,000 or less.
Furthermore, affluent, private universities rack in millions of dollars from U.S. taxpayers. The cost of subsidies for a student at a university such as Yale or Harvard is approximately $45,000- $70,000 per year. For a student going to California State University, Fullerton, it is $4,000; for someone going to Queensborough Community College, it is a little over $5,000. 
This is an appalling use of taxpayer dollars — tax-exemption statutes essentially aid affluent schools in spending egregiously on unnecessary sectors at the expense of students. 
In May, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas introduced a bill that would propose a new tax on the largest endowments of private institutions. The Ivory Tower Tax Act would put a 1% tax on the fair market value of private colleges’ endowments to support apprentice programs. 
Additionally, universities would be required to disburse 5% of their endowment per year “to support an educational mission.” Failing to distribute these funds would result in a deduction of 30% in funding. 
However, Sen. Cotton’s Ivory Tower Tax Act does not go far enough, as it only applies toward registered apprentice programs. More efficient and comprehensive laws should mandate that universities spend large percentages of their endowments and tax what they receive. 
In his book, “The War on Normal People: The Truth About America’s Disappearing Jobs and Why Universal Basic Income is our Future,” former Democratic presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang advocates for a law that requires any private university with an endowment of over $5 billion to lose its tax-exempt status unless it spends its total financial income from the previous year on educational fees, student support, and domestic expansion.
If such a theoretical law included public universities such as the University of California system, this would incentivize higher-learning institutions to spend millions more each year on their students. This would also motivate investment from schools near the $5 billion thresholds, such as USC.
Another plausible solution is a government tax on wealthy universities’ endowments; then, the federal government could use the revenue to subsidize students’ educations. 
For instance, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act implemented a new tax on some private, nonprofit universities and colleges. Higher-learning institutions with a minimum of 500 students and aid exceeding $500,000 per student will pay a surcharge of 1.4% on their net investment income. 
This tax still comes up short in requiring universities to provide for their students financially and ultimately include more schools. While it is estimated to generate $200 million, this number could be significantly higher if more universities are taxed. 
Ultimately, reforms must occur to hold elite universities accountable for amassing billions of tax-free dollars and not supporting college students financially.
