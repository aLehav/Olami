USC women’s water polo’s pursuit of back-to-back national championships was cut short on Saturday, as the third-ranked Trojans fell to No. 2 Stanford 11-10 in the NCAA semifinals in Indianapolis.
The 2017 season ultimately ended in disappointment for head coach Jovan Vavic’s squad, despite setting a national-record 52-game winning streak and opening the spring with 25 consecutive victories. USC didn’t have an answer to the Cardinal all season (1-3 in four meetings), and Stanford completed its Trojan-killing trifecta last weekend — snapping the streak in April and knocking USC out of both the MPSF Tournament and NCAA Championships.
The Trojans entered the championships as the No. 3 seed, coming off a third-place finish at the conference tournament. The defending national champions eased past Michigan to open their repeat bid at the IU Natatorium — 10 different USC players found the scoresheet and three goalies combined for 21 saves in a 12-6 victory, setting up a semifinal clash against Stanford — a repeat of last season’s national championship game.
Similar to four of the last five meetings between the two programs, one goal decided Saturday’s tilt. Stanford opened the scoring with a goal from senior Maggie Stefens, but junior utility Annika Jensen took a feed from freshman utility Maud Megens and slammed it home to bring the Trojans level 18 seconds later. This trend continued throughout the first half as the Cardinal edged ahead, only for USC to knot the game back up before Stanford could extend its lead. Megens, freshman driver Denise Mammolito, junior driver Brianna Daboub, junior utility Hayley McKelvey and senior driver Stephania Haralabidis all scored tying goals to send the teams into halftime deadlocked at six goals apiece.
The Trojans finally pushed their noses in front early in the third quarter. Megens powered in a shot from the point to once again break the tie, and Daboub turned in a pass from Haralabidis soon after to double USC’s advantage.
However Stanford roared back, scoring two unanswered goals after a timeout to tie the game for the eighth time. Haralabidis then set up Daboub for another goal to reestablish the Trojans’ lead, and sophomore goalie Amanda Longan turned away a Cardinal power play to maintain USC’s 9-8 edge going into the fourth quarter.
But heartbreak awaited the Trojans in the final frame. Stanford forced a 10-10 tie with 4:20 to play thanks to a converted six-on-five and Stefens’ fourth goal of the game, which cancelled out Haralabidis’ go-ahead effort just 14 seconds earlier. Less than a minute later, an exclusion on Megens set the Cardinal up on another power play, and junior Jordan Raney beat Longan to give Stanford its decisive 11-10 edge. Senior Gabby Stone saved efforts from Haralabidis and Megens in the Cardinal net, and USC bowed out of the NCAA Championships. Stanford went on to beat UCLA in Sunday’s final and lifted its sixth national title (USC has four).
With the 2017 season now in the books, the Trojans will graduate seven seniors before their next campaign, including three players who rank in the top 20 for scoring in program history: Haralabidis; her twin sister, Ioanna; and two-meter Brigitta Games. Though USC is losing a great deal of firepower on paper, the Trojans have finished in the national top five for 14 consecutive years. A new-look squad will look to make it 15 next season, in Vavic’s 24th year at the helm.

After winning back-to-back MPSF championships, the USC women’s lacrosse team looked to carry over its success in conference play to the NCAA Tournament. In pursuit of the first national championship in the program’s five-year history, the Trojans took a step in the right direction over the weekend, returning to the quarterfinals with wins over Jacksonville and No. 3 Florida. With the upset over Florida, USC joins Navy and Boston College as one of three unranked teams in the quarterfinals.
The Trojans opened their tournament with a 13-10 win over Jacksonville. Senior attacker and reigning MPSF Player of the Year Michaela Michael led the way with four goals and three assists, while freshman Kaeli Huff and senior attackers Kylie Drexel and Cynthia Del Core added three goals each to sink the Dolphins.
After the victory over Jacksonville, the Trojans advanced to a second-round matchup with regional host No. 3 Florida on Sunday. Despite suffering a loss to Florida earlier in the season, USC edged the Gators in a 15-12 upset.
In a well-rounded team win, the Trojans won thanks to six different goal scorers and another stalwart performance from Johns. The goalie tallied 14 saves, forced two turnovers and grabbed seven ground balls. Del Core led USC offensively, racking up her 14th career hat trick with four goals on the day. Freshman midfielder Kerrigan Miller scored three times while seniors Michaela Michael, Kylie Drexel, Gabby McMahon and Drew Jackson pitched in two apiece.
After conceding the opening goal to junior Allie Pavinelli, USC responded with goals of their own from Del Core, Michael and Miller, taking a 7-6 advantage into halftime, but Florida hit back with a 3-0 run to retake the lead. The Trojans and Gators traded goals in a back-and-forth second half, but USC went on a decisive 5-1 run in the last nine minutes of the game. The pivotal moment came when Jackson scored with six minutes left, evening the score at 12. Jackson struck again two minutes later on a free position shot, and the Trojan’s lead was further solidified with two late goals from McMahon. The 15-12 upset gave USC its 12th win in a row.
Next, Boston College (15-6) will host USC (18-3) on Saturday in Newton, Mass. The Eagles boast an impressive home record of 8-1 this season and are led by sophomore attacker Sam Apuzzo, who recorded 7 points in each of the Eagles’ tournament games over the weekend. BC, also unranked going into the tournament, reached the quarterfinals with a pair of convincing wins. The Eagles beat Canisius 21-9 in their first-round game and followed up with a 21-10 win over No. 6 Syracuse — the team that sent the undefeated Trojans home last year.
With 2016’s heartbreaking 12-11 quarterfinal loss in the back of their minds, the Trojans will look to do one better this year and advance to the semifinals for the first time in program history. With eight seniors on the roster, USC has talent and plenty of tournament experience, and the Trojans will continue their championship pursuit this weekend, with their match against BC set to begin at 1 p.m. EST on Saturday.

The USC beach volleyball team won the NCAA National Championship on May 7, beating Pepperdine 3-2 to clinch the program’s third consecutive national title.
The No. 1 ranked Trojans had been dominant all year, finishing with a 38-1 record, so it was no surprise they found themselves in Gulf Shores, Ala. last weekend, looking to defend their back-to-back national championships. USC carried its regular-season momentum into the National Collegiate Beach Volleyball Championship, running rampant through the competition. Facing the top programs in the nation, the Trojans were flawless, and they swept South Carolina, Hawaii and Pepperdine to earn a spot in the final.
But for the first time since their sole loss of the season against UCLA in the Pac-12 Championship, the Trojans faced major adversity in their rematch against Pepperdine. The first dual of the final matchup went in favor of Pepperdine’s Deahna Kraft and Anika Wilson, who downed the young pair of sophomore Abril Bustamante and freshman Joy Dennis. The Trojans responded quickly, as juniors Jenna Belton and and Jo Kremer dispensed of their competition 21-18, 21-15.
With the two teams tied at 1-1, Pepperdine’s Brittany Howard and Corinne Quiggle regained the Waves’ advantage with a tough three-set victory over seniors Sophie Bukovec and Allie Wheeler. The seesawing affair continued with the Trojans’ decorated senior pair of Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes winning another tightly contested three-set dual, evening the match at two wins apiece.
Both teams were set for a deciding final matchup with the National Championship on the line. It was up to junior Terese Cannon and senior Nicolette Martin to notch a win over Pepperdine’s Skylar Caputo and Heidi Dyer and bring home another national title. After capturing the first set 21-19, the Trojan pair dropped the second 18-21, setting up a dramatic final frame in an already razor-thin final.
But the Trojans were able to seize the moment, as Cannon and Martin won the title-clinching set 15-13, giving USC 104 all-time NCAA team championships. For seniors Kelly Claes, Sophie Bukovec, Allie Wheeler, Sara Hughes and Nicolette Martin — who made up head coach Anna Collier’s first recruiting class — the win over Pepperdine marked their third national championship in four years at USC.
“They came in and pretty much set the tone from the beginning,” Collier said. “From the moment they were sophomores, they took control of the situation and started building a team culture. They improved so much in volleyball, but more than that, they became a unit.”
Collier refers to the group as the “Fab Five,” and on Sunday, the senior class solidified its legacy in USC history, giving the Trojans their 20th NCAA championship in women’s sports.
“It came down to those last two points,” Claes said. “It was just an unreal feeling — I’m on cloud nine right now. I’m just so proud of all these girls and the fight that all of us had.”
To wrap up a season full of silverware, the Trojans had three pairs selected to the all-tournament team, including Claes and Hughes, who were named the top overall pair. Cannon and Martin were honored as the No. 3 pair, with Bustamante and Dennis following just behind in No. 4.

Cooper Nelson thought she wanted to go to college on the East Coast when she was in high school. But little did she know, her college career on the West Coast would end with her delivering the valedictorian speech for the USC Class of 2017 as the first valedictorian from the School of Cinematic Arts.
“The work that’s done [at the School of Cinematic Arts] is wonderful,” Nelson said. “The talent that comes out of that school is incredible, and it was just an honor to kind of represent all of my fellow cinema kids.”
Originally from Marin County in Northern California, Nelson was drawn to USC due to receiving the prestigious Trustee Scholarship. She majored in cinema and media studies and history, culture and law, and minored in screenwriting. However, her work at USC went beyond her classes.
Along with receiving a 4.0 grade point average, Nelson is a member of the ski and snowboard teams, and also gave back to the community during her time in college by working as Pi Beta Phi’s philanthropy chair. She said she was most proud of promoting child literacy with local elementary school children through the national program Champions Are Readers with which the sorority partners.
“I never would have guessed that one of my best memories of my sorority would have been being able to engage in efforts in local schools,” she said.
Heliya Alam, Cooper’s friend and graduated with a degree in cinematic arts and critical studies on Friday, said that Nelson never let her commitment to academic pursuits get in the way of her extracurricular activities.
“She does a lot extracurricular activities that I do not know how she got her 4.0,” Alam said. “Every weekend she’s in the nature doing some type of activity and surfing, and she used to be on the ski team. I’m just so excited to see what she comes up with.”
Nelson and Alam became friends through their mutual love for the entertainment industry. They shared classes at the School of Cinematic Arts and both rushed the Pi Beta Phi sorority.
“She’s been one of my best friends and almost like a sister to me,” Alam said. “I could totally see her at my wedding, and I think that goes both ways. We’ve gone through a lot together.”
According to Alam, she and Nelson refer to each other as “princesses” because they are both in need of each other’s friendship. When Nelson spent a semester abroad in Australia, the two of them face-timed each other three times a week. The two will be roommates post-college starting in the fall.
“I don’t think I’m going to let go of her all too easily, and I don’t think she wants to let go of me that easily,” Alam said. “She’s still stuck with me.”
Alam said she is sure Nelson will “make it big” in Hollywood by creating a cartoon that she said will somehow change the world.
Nelson said she had never thought about going into the entertainment business until SCA showed her what was possible.
“[SCA is] the best in the world; it’s revered” Nelson said. “And, you know, it’s one of the only places where you can get this kind of education. The combination of a USC education with like really the best training in entertainment that’s available.”
Nelson found out she would be valedictorian sitting alongside Alam and 30 other sisters from her sorority.
“My reaction was more shocked and excited than her reaction because I think she was just speechless … I’m really, really proud of her.” Alam said.
Nelson said the feeling of being valedictorian still puts her in shock.
“I’m absolutely honored to have been chosen,” Nelson said. “There are amazing kids in the graduating class … USC only gets better and better, and it was incredible to be given this opportunity to represent the school, especially the School of Cinematic Arts.”

A 24-hour Starbucks will replace Café 84 this fall, according to Erik Russell, associate director of residential dining at USC Hospitality. Along with this change, the new dining hall at USC Village will serve both residents at the complex and West Residential College.
“One of the main things that students have been looking for is a study space, something that’s open 24 hours, that’s not a library,” Russell said.
Russell said that side of campus was underserved with study spaces and that the new Starbucks will provide a space for students to do work and study. He also said that USC Hospitality is looking to add a food vendor along with the Starbucks at that location. However, the exact vendor has yet to be determined.
Though the new dining hall will be closer to Fluor and Webb towers than either Everybody’s Kitchen or Parkside Restaurant and Grill, former Fluor Tower residential adviser Cindy Andrade said that having to walk off campus will be inconvenient for residents at West Residential College.
“I think it is nice that [USC Village] will have its own dining hall, but Fluor and Webb residents did not have nearby dining halls on weekends [prior to this change] and now they have to go somewhere else everyday,” Andrade said. “I think it’s sad that they’re removing Café 84 from that area.”
Despite the closure, the new dining hall at USC Village will be open on weekends unlike Café 84, Russell said. He added that it will accommodate roughly twice the amount of people as Café 84, and will feature an all plant-based dining station, which he said students had requested.
“I think that kind of makes up for it a little bit because Café 84 wasn’t open on weekends so that was inconvenient because I had to go across campus,” former Fluor resident Karel Cobian said.
Russell also added that thanks to the closure of Café 84, one of the dining halls will be able to stay open during spring break, which he said was one of the concerns students had during the year. In addition, Everybody’s Kitchen will be open an extra hour each day, closing at 11 p.m. for students living in that area.
“We’ve been working with the Office of Residential Education, really trying to meet the students’ needs,” Russell said.
Café 84 was originally built during the 1984 Olympics to serve as a dining option for athletes. The Café 84 space used to serve as a food court, but became a residential dining hall in 2013.
USC Housing declined to comment.

Keynote speaker, comedian and alumnus Will Ferrell was a crowd-favorite among students and their families at USC’s 134th annual commencement ceremony on Friday, delivering a speech with advice, insights and song. However, the day before USC’s commencement ceremony at the historically black Bethune-Cookman University, graduating seniors had a very different experience.
School officials selected Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has demonstrated shocking ignorance about historically black colleges and universities, as the school’s 2017 commencement speaker.  Students were rightfully frustrated to reach the end of their college careers and be confronted with a speaker so antithetical to their values and misrepresentative of their experiences. Despite dedicating four years of hard work at the institution, they were given no say or agency in deciding who would speak at one of the most important events of their lives. Therein lies a recurring issue at universities across the nation, an issue that could and should be remedied by giving students — whom commencement ceremonies are supposedly all about honoring — a voice.
On Wednesday, Bethune-Cookman University’s graduating students, who had risen from their seats to boo and turn their backs to DeVos, were warned that if they did not stop, the ceremony would be canceled and their diplomas would be mailed to them. Still, the students did not relent. It’s important that we not allow accusations of purported millennial hypersensitivity and intolerance of other viewpoints to distract from the real issue at hand — that commencement is about the graduates and offering them an opportunity to reflect on four years of growth through speakers who they believe can adequately speak to this.
In Bethune-Cookman University’s case, graduating students were wholly justified in their belief that DeVos could not speak to those experiences. DeVos has previously identified historically black colleges and universities as “pioneers” for “school choice” — an ignorant and painfully ironic sentiment given their origins in addressing segregation and nationalized racism. Her words disregarded the many black students who were historically barred from attending schools that were not designated for African Americans, and were tone-deaf to the continued discrimination faced by black youth.
DeVos wasn’t wrong to praise the many achievements of historically black colleges, but her ignorance of the rich history of racism and oppression from which these achievements stem from was not only offensive, but also signaled her inability to speak to the experiences of Bethune-Cookman University’s graduating class.
Additionally, the appointment of DeVos as Secretary of Education, for no other apparent reason than her millions of contributions to the Republican Party was offensive in itself to college students across the nation. DeVos’ ignorance and stark lack of experience with college loans and student debt is already being translated into unforgiving policies that make paying off debt more difficult for students and graduates. Her dedication to favoring private schools and instituting a system of school vouchers would decimate public schools and harm middle-class and low-income students.
Frankly, student protest is always justified. Contrary to Trump’s sentiments that students should not be “critics” at his Saturday commencement speech at Liberty University, we should aspire to create a society of young people guided to speak and act on their convictions.
That being said, it is an entirely separate debate as to whether individuals such as DeVos should be invited and given platforms to speak at colleges at any time of the year. However, commencement is unique from all other speaking opportunities at American universities — it is separate from merely giving a speaker a platform, as it is a direct demonstration of honor for the chosen speakers. Commencement ceremonies should not disrespect students by taking a ceremony meant to celebrate their values and achievements and using it to honor individuals who do not align with their values. DeVos’ statements and work against students’ best interests should have rendered her ineligible for such an honor.
Ultimately, when it comes to commencement, no school can claim that the ceremony is about celebrating its graduating students if their input is entirely disregarded, and if they are offered no determinism in how they will be celebrated. To that end, graduating students should have the power to nominate and vote for commencement speakers, or at the very least, be given choices by the university’s administration.
Now more than ever, higher education is about the exploration of students’ values and convictions. It may be that commencement ceremonies are apolitical and are not about honoring any particular values and convictions. They are about honoring the unique processes and experiences that allow students to grow and develop these values and convictions. To invite and honor individuals who students do not perceive as reflective of these processes and experiences, and to offer students no voice in shaping a ceremony that is meant to honor them, strips the ceremony of its value and purpose.
This graduation day speaker was a dud, in the opinion of writer Cheing. OK, but even if so, is this a good reason for the BCC administration to abdicate from selecting graduation day speakers? What if the BCC students had traditionally chosen graduation speakers, and picked a dud? Then they should abdicate from selecting graduation day speakers? This makes no sense.
This, in her article, makes sense, though: 
     “Ultimately, when it comes to commencement, no school can claim that the ceremony is about celebrating its graduating students if their input is entirely disregarded . . . graduating students should have the power to nominate and vote for commencement speakers, or at the very least, be given choices by the university’s administration.”

USC is more than a campus — it’s a community. And this fall, it will welcome an entirely new village. After years of construction, hundreds of millions of dollars and over 1 million hours of toil, USC’s recent expansive development project will open this July. USC Village will undoubtedly expand the horizons of the University and thousands of its students. Despite the progress that has been made, relationships between USC and its surrounding community must be mended and new bridges need to be built when the final bricks of construction are laid.
After years of negotiations with Los Angeles City Council and community activists, USC agreed to pay $20 million to fund affordable housing in the area and to support other measures that would benefit the local community. One of these measures is a job-hiring and training program that will benefit thousands of USC’s neighbors. As the largest private employer in the city of Los Angeles, USC hired several thousand workers to construct USC Village, with 15 percent of these workers commuting within a five-mile radius of the construction. For the workers, this project is more than just a job; it’s a key to a better future. Not only did this construction provide the training and experience for workers to move on to other jobs, but also through programs like 2nd Call and My Brother’s Keeper, the work provides a second chance to formerly incarcerated community members who were recruited for the job. Once the project is completed, 100,000 square feet of retail space will provide more opportunities for job-seekers.  Already ,more than 1,000 resumes have already been submitted.
These stories and statistics are often lost among students, who are misguided in believing that gentrification is the only effect of USC Village. Encroaching gentrificatoin is evident in surrounding areas, especially in south central Los Angeles near Hollywood and Downtown. With new developments in historically low-income areas attracting wealthier homebuyers, the local population often becomes displaced by higher rental prices. So when USC Village, an impressive collection of apartment buildings located right off campus, began to rise, so did fears of squeezing out members of the surrounding community.
Yet USC Village could solve this very same problem. After their freshman year, many students search for housing in the local neighborhood, inadvertently raising rental prices for community members as retailers can charge higher prices for these college students. But now, with nearly 3,000 more USC students living on-campus in USC Village, there will no longer be as many students competing with local community members for housing. USC Village will then reducing the housing demand surrounding campus, and potentially drive down prices.
That’s not to say problems will no longer exist. The real effects of gentrification could manifest in the retail shops dotting the ground level of USC Village. Seventeen of the 37 businesses removed from the University Village complex were non-franchise businesses. Any of these non-franchise businesses were locally owned, from mom-and-pop convenience stores to small businesses. Despite the fact that USC provided financial assistance for the relocation or closing of these businesses, the community still lost a part of their neighborhood. Even though the University, according to the USC Village website, emphasizes “that student customer price points and community member custom prices points are an extremely good match,” many worry that these new shops, catered to the USC community, will be unaffordable to a surrounding population where almost half of the residents live in poverty.
As our campus expands, so too must our perspectives and consciences. USC Village is not only a blessing and an opportunity, but it is also a challenge. The University must be conscious of its effects on the community, and students must also engage with neighbors and do their part to build and strengthen a village of their own. It is the students’ responsibility to extend their hand and spend these next years engaging with — not isolating — the community. This could take place in the form of volunteering through the Joint Educational Project or working to make the Village more of a community space through communal events in the new quad and new outreach initiatives. Because ultimately, the Trojan Family extends past the vast borders and alumni base.

Some of the most talented literary masterminds will gather at the Skirball Cultural Center on Wednesday for a night of storytelling and reflection. Hosted by the prestigious National Book Foundation, “An Evening with the National Book Awards” provides an intimate space for readers to speak to some of today’s most popular authors. The event will consist of a panel with author and USC professor Viet Thanh Nguyen, poet Robin Coste Lewis and fiction author Karan Mahajan.
Nguyen is a professor of English and American studies and ethnicity at USC. His book, Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War, was one of five finalists nominated for the 2016 National Book Awards in the nonfiction category.
“I wanted to write stories that would contest the American stories of the Vietnam War,” Nguyen said, in a previous interview with Daily Trojan. “We as Vietnamese refugees are people considered [to those in Vietnam] as traitors, losers, dissidents. It’s a struggle to make our presence and our memory heard and felt.”
Nguyen’s first and best-selling novel The Sympathizer won a Pulitzer Prize in 2015. Since then, he has continued to pursue his passion as a writer and storyteller. His other works include Race and Resistance: Literature and Politics in Asian America and a collection of short stories titled The Refugees.
“It took me 18 years of struggle and pain of writing constantly and continually, of experiencing rejection and obscurity before I got to write The Sympathizer in two years,” Nguyen said. “What I’ve learned is that in terms of writing, it’s the art, the discipline that matters.”
Robin Coste Lewis will also speak on the panel about writing and authorship in the modern era. A Ph.D. candidate in creative writing and literature at USC, Lewis is an award-winning poet whose passion and talent have not gone unnoticed. Her work, Voyage of the Sable Venus, won the 2015 National Book Award for Poetry — the first poetry debut to receive the honor since 1974.
“I wanted the poem both to talk about the history of visual culture (race, gender, power) while also performing the history of poetic forms in English, simultaneously,” Lewis said in an interview with Literary Hub. “To perform poetic history over time, formally, on the page, while using the language itself to discuss the visual culture that flourished aside that poetic tradition.”
Lewis’ long poem attempts to redefine what beauty is, while also retelling historical events. Her poetry is deeply spiritual and reflective of her background studying comparative religious literature at Harvard University,
The final author, Karan Mahajan, is an Indian American fiction writer who writes about the aftermath of a terrorist attack in New Delhi, following the stories of people who grapple with loss, strength and fear.
“Extreme emotions exert an enormous pull on characters and the writer; it is possible to accidentally exalt them or veer into melodrama. What I wanted to do was normalize states of extremity — to show that, despite their horror, these are human states,” Mahajan said in an interview with the National Book Foundation. “Realizing that there was an intricate link between terrorists and victims—or at least the mentality of victimhood — was a way in.”
These authors all carry an innate talent for storytelling, as reflected in their nominations for the the National Book Awards.
Tickets are available on the Skirball Center website. The event will take place from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Wednesday.

When Daniel Newman heard that a group of student entrepreneurs in New York had created a Shark Tank-style competition for undergraduates, he realized USC would be the perfect venue for the West Coast counterpart.
“I thought, we need to bring this to L.A.,” said Newman, a sophomore majoring in business administration and real estate development. “We have venture capitalists who are really focused on students here. And we have the fanatic Shark Tank viewers. Everyone I know watches Shark Tank.”
Newman founded the New York event’s organizers through the TAMID Group, a student organization that supports Israeli startups through consulting and educating American investors about Israeli stocks traded on U.S. exchanges. At the New York TAMID Tank, entrepreneur Kevin Harrington, a former “shark” on Shark Tank, made an on-the-spot $100,000 investment in a student project.
Newman spotted the opportunity to draw attention to USC’s entrepreneurial scene and moved quickly. As the vice president of operations for TAMID at USC, Newman recruited 15 classmates to plan the TAMID Tank event that was held April 24 in Bovard Auditorium.
Three startups were chosen as finalists to present at the event and compete for $3,500 in prize money. To divvy up the cash awards, Newman and his team opted for a different model than the spontaneous buyouts for which Shark Tank is known. Instead, the 500-person audience texted in their votes. First prize and $2,000 went to Aqus, a profit-generating water filtration system for aspiring capitalists in impoverished nations.
Newman suggested the Shark Tank model misrepresents the amount of time that goes into a real investment decision.
“The whole venture capital process takes a bit more than a 10-minute pitch,” Newman said. “There’s a whole due diligence process, which sometimes takes two months, sometimes a whole year. It’s very rare you’ll see a venture capitalist invest on the spot like they do on Shark Tank.”
But that doesn’t mean those who appeared at TAMID Tank were mere referees.
“What I was able to do is connect the winners with the [venture capitalists] afterward for potential investment, after a couple of meetings,” Newman said. “These are all very serious startups that the students are planning on pursuing full time in the summer if not after they graduate.”
In other words, the TAMID Tank finalists will likely reinvest their winnings back into their companies.
Though Newman served in a curatorial role for TAMID Tank, he is an entrepreneur himself, too. In high school, he created a startup employing high school seniors as tutors for younger students in their communities. He also built a marketing agency to help businesses reach millennials with Snapchat geofilters.
In the future, Newman may pursue a career as an entrepreneur, but his work with TAMID has inspired him to take greater interest in venture capitalism. He hopes to deepen his ties to USC’s network of student startups and build a community of student entrepreneurs during his remaining two years in school.
As a next step, Newman will spend this summer interning at UpWest Labs, a diverse venture capital firm based in Tel Aviv, with 240 other TAMID students.
