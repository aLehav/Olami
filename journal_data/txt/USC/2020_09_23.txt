The Undergraduate Student Government appointed a new executive cabinet in a 10-1 vote during its Senate meeting Tuesday. The new appointments come after USG President Gabe Savage and Vice President Trinity Moore during their Senate confirmation meeting expressed their desire to bolster diversity within USG and bridge divides between the organization and the student body that arose over the summer. 
The new cabinet will serve for the remainder of Savage and Moore’s term. 
The cabinet appointments follow the resignations of former President Truman Fritz, former Vice President Rose Ritch and former Sen. Isabel Washington, all of whom stepped down during the summer after evidence and allegations of racial misconduct arose involving the three USG members. Savage and Moore were sworn in to replace Fritz and Ritch in late August. 
“We know an issue with the previous cabinet was that it did not properly reflect the student body … so I think that even the virtue of being more representative is a step in the right direction in terms of closing the gap and reestablishing some of that trust,” Savage said at Tuesday’s meeting. “One of USG’s primary goals this year is going to be to earn that trust back in order to show that the structure, system and integrity of this organization was not completely demolished this summer and that [those instances reflected] a couple of people and not the 200-member organization that we are.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan following the Senate meeting, Moore described the delicate balance between finding potential cabinet members with USG experience and considering those whose backgrounds might be more representative of the student body. 
“Are we weighing USG experience … and then how much do we want to yield to this movement that led us all here — this movement that directly called for more representation within USG; a cabinet that represented the greater student body,” Moore said. “Those were the main two things we were focusing on when building the cabinet. We think it’s important to have USG experience, but we also think that right now, maybe that’s not what we need. Maybe an outside perspective is what this movement calls for.”
Among those appointed to the executive cabinet was Lucy Warren, a junior majoring in economics and political science. Warren has no previous experience with USG and will serve as the cabinet’s chief diversity officer. Warren said she was excited to see that some of her own calls for increased diversity within USG were answered by her appointment to the executive cabinet. 
“I was one of the many calling for diversity within USG and really [hoped] to see myself represented within USG,” Warren said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “So I’m really proud of our team — to see so many faces that don’t look like the typical [USG member] is great.”
Warren also discussed the importance of improving transparency between USG and the student body. 
“I was so frustrated with transparency — not being able to understand what projects are happening, why they are happening, what’s stalling them,” Warren said. “My role will be to head the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, and a big goal of mine is to work and sit down with [student] groups … and create a way for students to be in constant communication with me.” 
Shreya Chaudhary, a junior majoring in business administration, will be joining Warren as the executive cabinet’s chief communications officer. Like Warren, Chaudhary joins the cabinet with no previous USG experience but shares Warren’s same conviction that USC’s student body must be empowered. 
“My goal is to maintain the brand of USC as well as to ensure that the communications that USC puts across is reflective of our values as well as everything we’re trying to make happen change-wise,” Chaudhary said. “My goal in regards to the position is to ensure that we make students feel like their voices are heard and represented and that they feel, as students, that they can make a positive impact.”
In addition to Warren and Chaudhary, Jina Hur — who previously held the same position in Fritz’s cabinet — Rachel Moten and Zachariah Taymuree were also appointed to the executive cabinet. Hur, a senior majoring in psychology and philosophy, is the cabinet’s chief programming officer. Moten, a senior majoring in public policy, will serve as chief of staff and Taymuree, a junior majoring in economics and mathematics, will serve as chief financial officer. Moten and Hur previously worked for USG in various capacities. Taymuree is a founding member of USC MENA, a cultural center at USC that celebrates Middle Eastern and North African voices. 
Following the cabinet confirmation, the Senate also discussed the Troy Philippines Support Resolution, which called for USG to sign and endorse its support of the Philippine Human Rights Act, an American bill that calls on the U.S. government to suspend security assistance to the Philippines.
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated that Zachariah Taymuree is the founder of USC MENA when he instead is one of the organization’s founding members. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

When Ava Sanchez was applying to colleges as a high school senior, she had trouble navigating the admissions process. Although some of her family members had gone through college, they did not have experience with the Common Application or applying to private universities. And unlike some high school students, she had no options for resources or application help services in her area outside of her school counselor.
Coming across essay editing services that charged between $100-$300 per essay, Sanchez realized she would have to rely on her school’s college counselor who also needed to work with around 500 other seniors. Her difficulty navigating the college admissions process inspired Sanchez to create an organization where college students could help high school students navigate the college application process by editing their application essays free of charge. 
“You’re just trying to put your best foot forward to the schools, which are essentially gatekeepers to your future [and] now — whatever ambitions you have for yourself,” Sanchez said. “Having great essays is a really big part of that. No one really knows what a great essay is. You just have to try and figure it out, and the best way to do that is to find people that have done it.”
Sanchez, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and economics who is a Trustee Scholar, created Ava Edits Essays in late-July to help students going through the college admissions process. Along with her team of undergraduate volunteers, Sanchez reviews and revises personal statements for many high school and transfer students. Sanchez said that she intends to keep the organization’s services free to edit three University of California statements, or three edits of one statement, since most universities require one personal statement and several personal insight questions.
Unlike many college preparatory services across the country, which offer standardized testing practice or application revisions, Sanchez wanted to make Ava Edits Essays accessible by not charging students.
“There are ambitious students that would benefit from these kinds of programs and just cannot afford them,” Sanchez said.
With each service, Ava Edits Essays provides line-by-line editing and feedback regarding the applicant’s strengths and weaknesses in writing. By keeping a small client base, the group’s goal is to provide an intimate and personable experience. 
Ava Edits Essays officially began offering services in August, when the Common App opened for high school seniors to apply to universities across the country. So far the organization has about 20 essays to review, but Sanchez said she expects demand to increase by the end of the month as deadlines approach. Many of the applicants using Ava Edits Essays are applying to University of California schools, and two are hoping to get into USC.
When she decided to start her organization, Sanchez initially made a post on social media calling for volunteers. Since then, she has curated a team of four other undergraduate students to assist by editing essays. Two of these volunteers were already friends of Sanchez, and the other two reached out via Instagram. All volunteers were required to submit writing samples for consideration and were selected from a pool of about 10 applicants.
“The idea is that [Sanchez] will manage it,” said Karina Aguirre, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture and an editor for Ava Edits Essays. “She gets the input from the essays and then based on our interests or qualifications in terms of if we worked on Cal State essays, UC statements, private schools or what schools we got into, we could help.”
Since many school counselors are overloaded with work during the pandemic, Sanchez said she hopes Ava Edits Essays can be a useful resource for applicants. 
“We try to be as holistic as possible, and we try to focus our whole entire goal to empower disadvantaged students and give them the voice that they need,” said Antonio Okeke, a sophomore majoring in business administration and the creative director and editor for Ava Edits Essays. 
In addition, some college essay editing services can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars, which Aguirre believes is inherently contributing to a privilege gap in college admissions.
“I strongly believe that there is [advantage] when you have students who are able to hire private tutors, who are able to hire essay editing services, and who have generations of parents that have gone to college,” Aguirre said. “It’s just much different.”
Because the program is fully online, Aguirre said it is also more accessible to students living in communities and rural areas that may lack tutoring and editing services and other resources that help students navigate college admissions. 
Okeke said that change starts from those who experience the disadvantage, and he hopes that Ava Edits Essays can be a light in the darkness scenario for those who don’t have access to most college application resources. He also said that the inequality can be traced back to the initial admissions of marginalized people into higher education institutions and while the process has changed over the years, there is still a long way to go before college application resources are completely accessible.
“Honestly, just coming from [the Black] community is the biggest inspiration that I can probably have,” Okeke said. “Without that, then I wouldn’t know what it’s like being a disadvantaged student and student of color. And students that are a minority need the help to get through this whole process. I think especially right now is the best time to have more of a voice in how the whole process goes.”
Currently, Ava Edits Essays is taking essay submissions and answering application questions on its Instagram page. Sanchez said the organization is taking steps to launch a website by the end of September, which will have FAQ forums for questions about the application process, information about scholarship opportunities and curated content for specific deadlines and dates.
“We’re trying to make sure that all of our plans are thoughtful, and actually effective and efficient, where we can actually stay open and helpful, hopefully create a bigger impact as time goes on,” Okeke said.
Correction: A previous version of this article mislabeled Ava Edits Essays as a nonprofit organization, implied that Sanchez is a first-generation student and that her family could not help her with the college application process. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

Four Thornton School of Music students performed at the inaugural Empowered Music Showcase Saturday Sept. 12, a virtual concert to raise money for the Groundswell Community Project. Backed by a four-piece band composed of popular music performance majors, the young artists brought down the warehouse in San Diego from which the event was streamed.
The high-production-value show marked the first event to take place on GigStreamTV, a new platform designed to bring the excitement of concerts to the homes of locked-down live music lovers. The showcase aimed to highlight female talent while raising money for Groundswell, an organization that provides support to women who have experienced trauma through surf therapy. Surf therapy is a recently developed method of treatment that harnesses the power of the ocean to combat stress and depression.
“Our hope is that every surfsister who opts into our programs creates their own sustainable surf practice held and supported by a community of surfsisters,” according to Groundswell’s website.
The first set of the night came from Maddy Davis, a sophomore majoring in music industry. Her setlist, which included a mix of singles, covers and unreleased songs, concluded with a standout, forthcoming jam titled “You Still Send Me Beats Though.” Having seen firsthand how the underrepresentation of women pervades the music industry, the theme of the showcase resonated with her.
“Being a music industry major and just like always having been in the music industry … it’s so obviously such a historically male-dominated network of people,” Davis said. “[Women empowerment] is about being OK if you are the only woman in the room, you’re OK with using your voice and making sure that you’re not any lesser than the men around you.”
Next up was Tippy Balady, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance with a songwriting emphasis. Her red, blue and gold eye makeup glimmering under the stage lights, she strummed her futuristic-looking, cherry red ukulele while powerfully belting out self-written vocals.
“I shift between imagination and real life events,” Balady said. “I’ve written about pirates, stuff from my childhood, about scuba diving … and then stuff that is prominent in my life in the moment. ‘Family Dinners’ is about my parents’ divorce, and I’ve written a song about how anxiety affects me.”
Ellie Williams, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance, delivered the third set of the night. A screen spanning the stage’s length displayed visuals of warm-colored clouds, a fitting accompaniment for an out-of-this-world performance. She identified strongly with the inclusive message of the event.
“Being a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I think women empowerment to me just means acceptance and encouragement,” Williams said. “I, in a sense, challenge heteronormative storylines for women in today’s world through my music. I have songs about other girls and women and my experiences, and I think to just have those stories accepted by my peers … has played such a huge role in how I present myself and being able to be comfortable in who I am.”
Cordelia Degher, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance with a songwriting emphasis who performs mononymously as Cordelia, closed out the show. During her performance, she brought all three of the previous performers on stage with her to sing backup for her unreleased original “Good Time.” All four artists supported one another throughout the night by providing backup vocals intermittently during each other’s sets.
“For me, female empowerment is just being your unapologetic self, being confident and knowing your worth, and also encouraging all the women around you to do the same,” Degher said. “I’m always cussing and talking about sex, I’m not classy. People are always like ‘oh my God, Cordelia, like blah.’ But I want to be rowdy, and I want to be loud cause I don’t care, and I want other girls to feel that way too and not feel like they have to suppress themselves and suppress their emotions.”
The inspiration for the event followed the wave of concert cancellations that came as a result of the coronavirus. The team behind GigStreamTV decided to create a live music streaming platform and launch with the Empowered Music Showcase.
“We wanted to be able to offer something that looks more like a made-for-TV live event that still has multiple camera shots, high definition and is just a really exciting, interesting show to watch,” Matt Schwartz, the event’s stage manager, said.
The Empowered Music Showcase is available to watch in its entirety at gigstreamtv.com.

I have always felt that Candace from “Phineas and Ferb” is misunderstood. 
If you haven’t seen the show (and you really should), it is a Disney Channel cartoon about Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb who try to occupy each day of their summer vacation by building large elaborate structures such as roller coasters and spaceships. Candace, the almost-antagonist of the show and their older sister, attempts to snitch on Phineas and Ferb to their mom but fails to do so because in every episode, their invention gets destroyed before she gets home. 
Throughout the show, we see Candace as the classic representation of a moody teenager: She’s obsessed with a boy, she’s mean to her younger siblings and she has a no-one-understands-me complex. But I always sympathized with Candace. I thought there was more to her. 
So you can imagine the joy I felt when I found out about the new movie, “Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe,” in which Candace is the protagonist, and we finally get to see her perspective. Watching this movie, I realized that not only did I relate to Candace personally, but her space adventure has more meaning than I anticipated. 
As an actor, I’ve always struggled with the knowledge that while I may have my own artistic ambitions, the money-first nature of the entertainment business will not always allow me to pursue them. As artists and as people, we have to reconcile our visions and dreams with the harsh realities of what actually sells. “Candace Against the Universe” provides insight into how we can do what we want — and be happy with where that takes us — without getting pulled away from our dreams by the promise of fame and fortune. (by the way I’m pretty much going to talk about everything that happened in this movie, so if you haven’t seen it and don’t want spoilers, watch and come back.) 
The movie begins with Candace’s perfect-day song sequence (á la “Legally Blonde”) ruined by Phineas and Ferb’s newest invention, which she fails to bust them for. Candace breaks down and sings a song about how everyone has always focused on how special her brothers are and no one pays attention to her throughout her life. Which honestly, girl, same. We all feel like that sometimes, pushed aside and antagonized for being annoyed by it. Next, Candace gets abducted by aliens (because it’s a children’s movie), and they tell her that she is their “chosen one” because her body contains the rare element remarkalonium. We see Candace finally get to step into the spotlight and be special. 
Candace reminded me of a man I consider a mentor. For the purposes of this article, let’s call him Ted. Ted grew up in Chicago’s suburbs in a family of lawyers (pretty much everyone in his family, three generations back, has been a lawyer). His older sister was in law school when he entered high school and their parents praised her for her academic success. On the other hand, Ted never earned higher than a “C” all of high school and graduated by the skin of his teeth. He wasn’t going to be a lawyer. 
The day after he graduated, he moved to New York to figure out what he wanted to do with his life. He became really close friends with an actor who encouraged him to audition for a teen romance TV show through his job at a restaurant. Not expecting much, Ted auditioned for the show. He got the part. And from that show, he booked another. And another. And another. Pretty soon, he was booking more jobs than he could keep up with. Ted thought that he finally belonged. He found his remarkalonium, the element that made him special. 
Anyway, back to Candace. After spending a couple of hours as the chosen one, Candace began to question her status. The aliens told her that the remarkalonium that she possessed was the ability to convert oxygen to carbon dioxide. They needed to power their special plant, so they trapped Candace and handcuffed her to a treadmill so she would produce more carbon dioxide. Candace realized she was trapped and had to escape this planet and go back home. And with the help of Phineas and Ferb, she found out that she had been special all along and didn’t need a group of extraterrestrial creatures to tell her that. Awww. Roll credits. 
Like Candace, Ted began to feel trapped. He was doing the same rom-coms, playing essentially the same character for years. He wasn’t going anywhere. And like Candace, he had to escape. So he took a leap of faith and started his own theater company. It was scary and stressful at first, but Ted finally got to do what he had been longing for so long. He was writing, producing, directing and acting in plays that mattered to him. Plays that said something about the world that he wanted to share with his audience. Ted realized that he didn’t need fame. He didn’t need to be “the chosen one” to be special. He was special all on his own. Awww. Roll credits. 
“Candace Against the Universe” isn’t a story about a girl who has to go through a space adventure to realize that she’s special. Well, it is. But to me, it’s about so much more than that. It’s about the life of an artist and the instability of feeling unspecial and craving that little place in the universe where you’re the most special. It’s about realizing that you don’t need others to validate you. It’s about choosing what you want to do, and what really matters over pursuing popularity and fame.

The United Black Student-Athletes Association was founded following the brutal and graphic murder of George Floyd in May. Shocked by continual brutality and fed up with the constant disregard for Black people in America, several student-athletes banded together to form an organization within USC Athletics to advocate for ourselves as Black people, athletes and students. We recognize how being an athlete adds intersectionality to our identities and experiences, and how racist structures are present even within athletic departments. 
One of our more tangible goals in the UBSAA is to create a community and safe space within Athletics for student-athletes to convene, discuss and advocate for ourselves and each other. Among our calls to action for the USC Athletic Department were: a statement affirming that USC Athletics stood behind the Black Lives Matter movement, commitment to diversifying the Athletics staff, creating safe and healthy work environments for employees and providing more Black physicians and sports psychologists to help better serve Black student-athletes. At the root of our advocacy is the knowledge that as student-athletes, we have a platform where we can advocate independently. 
But, this platform usually exists in a liminal space between our athleticism and education. When we step outside the realm of sports and schoolwork, our platform falls beneath us and we are told to “shut up and dribble.”
To those within the realm of athletics, we exist as a form of income to the university and another statistic to add to prestige. We are stereotyped as spoiled “jocks” who separate themselves from the rest of our campus communities. At the basis of both of these viewpoints is one key dividing factor: our scholarships. Paid tuition for student-athletes equates to equal compensation for our blood, sweat and tears in the university’s opinion. For non-athletes, it’s an unfair advantage. Existing between this crux of opinions is exhausting as it is. But even more tiring is how both views work to silence or diminish any concerns or hardships student-athletes encounter. 
We are told that our scholarships are more than enough compensation for our athletic dedication to the school. However, the secondhand scholarship cost is the right to our personal image — we cannot profit or benefit from the promotion of ourselves and our likeness. 
These scholarships fail to cover certain school-related costs. Stipends don’t fully cover the cost of living, our scholarships only cover the bare minimum of school credits per semester and often it takes the full effort of an athlete to advocate for the full protection of their scholarship when it comes to tutors, testing fees and even medical care. As a governing body, the NCAA views athletes only as a source of income and the very thing we are supposed to be so grateful for, our free education, is unabashedly threatened and manipulated by this institution if an athlete chooses to transfer. Suddenly, a student who is supposed to be more than grateful for their opportunity to higher education faces the threat of having an entire coast of the country blocked off from them should they choose to transfer from their current institution. 
And it continues at an even smaller level. Across athletic departments, microaggressions and racialized gate-keeping tactics form anywhere from the assistant coach level to an athletic director threatening to kick anyone out of the school should they choose to kneel during the anthem. Our fans, supporters and donors get away with hurling slurs at us from the sidelines or via social media. But at the end of the day, we are getting a “full ride,” so we should be more than gracious. 
To our peers, classmates and teachers, we are immediately othered the second we walk into class with the identifying student-athlete backpack. Professors often intimidate student-athletes into dropping their classes, assuming that said athlete will not complete assignments and therefore fail the class. For some athletes, coaches advise them away from studying certain majors — effectively derailing their futures. 
Our peers who take the same classes and exams as us regularly diminish any academic prowess a student-athlete may or may not possess. They claim we exist only within the bubbles of our sports — our admission was circumstantial, our intelligence inconsequential and any hardship is diminished. 
Cycling through this dichotomous campus existence, most forget to factor in any other parts of our being. When we begin advocating for ourselves, particularly outside the realm of our sports and schoolwork, we face belittlement, retaliation and the potential loss of our scholarship. Suddenly, we are advocating for these civil justice movements only because they’re “trending” in the media and not because of the fact that outside of the context of campus, we are just Black, and the “privileges” afforded to us as student-athletes become moot points. Within the UBSAA, our goal is to better the student-athlete experience and address racism and inequality within our own department and on campus.

The 2020 NFL season kicked off in early September, with players and coaches alike adjusting to unique safety protocols and mostly empty stadiums.
For USC, the beginning of another season offers an opportunity to watch former Trojan stars perform and solidify themselves on the professional stage. Here’s an update on how some USC alumni in the NFL have performed as a new season gets underway.
Porter Gustin
After struggling to find a home on an NFL roster in his first season as a pro, former Trojan defensive star Porter Gustin seems to have asserted himself as a force on the Cleveland Browns’ defensive line. 
Gustin has been active and played in both of Cleveland’s first two games this season, including a memorable performance on Thursday Night Football where Gustin consistently pressured the Cincinnati Bengals’ offensive line throughout the contest. Gustin finished the evening with four total tackles including one tackle for loss and an immense impact not seen on the stat sheet, with his presence threatening last year’s Heisman winner, quarterback Joe Burrow, all night.  
JuJu Smith-Schuster
After what Smith-Schuster might consider a down year by his standards, the former USC wideout will be looking to get back on track with the Pittsburgh Steelers this season following the return of starting quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. 
In Smith-Schuster’s first two seasons as a pro with Roethlisberger as signal-caller, he caught a combined 14 touchdown passes, compared to just three last season while battling injuries and inconsistent quarterback play from Mason Rudolph and Devlin Hodges.
Smith-Schuster’s 2020 season looks to be on the right track so far as he’s caught 13 passes for 117 yards and two touchdowns across the first two games thus far.
Austin Jackson
In just his rookie season, former USC offensive tackle and first round draft pick Austin Jackson has already been named a starter for the Miami Dolphins. Jackson has started and played most offensive snaps for Miami at the ever-important left tackle position in both of their games so far this season. 
Jackson and Miami are still in search of their first win of the 2020 season.  
Robert Woods
After signing a four-year extension with the Los Angeles Rams worth potentially up to $65 million, Woods will be looking to assert himself once again as one of Los Angeles’ top offensive weapons. 
After leading the team in targets in 2019, Woods is looking to maintain his steady production as a pass-catcher and occasional rusher for head coach Sean McVay and the Rams’ offense this season. Over his first two games, Woods has been in familiar form, posting strong outings in back-to-back wins to open up the 2020 campaign. In Week 1, Woods eclipsed the century mark in receiving yards, hauling in six passes on eight targets for 105 yards. In Week 2, Woods collected two passes and three rushing attempts along with his first touchdown of the season on the ground. 
Leonard Williams
Despite a lack of team success, former first round draft pick defensive lineman Leonard Williams is settling into his role under new head coach Joe Judge. In two frustrating losses for the New York Giants, Williams has racked up a total of six tackles and two tackles for loss, including one sack. 
Williams is in the final year of his rookie contract and will be looking to earn himself a hefty payday this offseason. 
Sam Darnold
Across town, Darnold and the New York Jets are undergoing a similarly frustrating start to their season as the Giants. 
The Jets have lost their first two games convincingly while Darnold and the offense have struggled mightily. Darnold has a 62.7% completion percentage with just two touchdowns in two games, while also being sacked four times and intercepted once. 
Nelson Agholor 
The former Super Bowl champion left Philadelphia after five seasons this offseason, making the move to Las Vegas to join John Gruden and the Raiders in their first season after relocating.
Agholor agreed to a one-year veteran minimum contract worth just more than $1 million. The former first-round draft pick will be hoping to regain his past form in the Silver and Black. Agholor has caught just two passes in his first two games, but one of them was for a 23-yard touchdown in the Raiders’ Week 1 win against the Carolina Panthers. 
Ronald Jones II
Despite a host of talent in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers skill positions and backfield, head coach Bruce Arians recently gave the former second-round draft pick Jones a vote of confidence. After announcing Jones as the starter but signing former first-round running back Leonard Fournette just a few days later, speculation swirled surrounding Jones’ status as the starter. Arians doubled down on his statement and reiterated that Jones was the lead back just days before the start of the season. 
Arians has followed up on his statement, as Jones has received more touches than any other member of the Tampa Bay backfield through two games, recording 24 carries and four receptions along with a touchdown in two games so far.

With dreamy visuals and refreshing lyricism, Boy Willows — also known as Landon Fleischman — is solidifying his place in the music industry. His innovative blend of experimental folk draws on a sense of nostalgia that resonates with Gen-Z listeners.
Influenced by his upbringing in Maryland, Fleischman began to develop an affinity for music. Early on, the natural landscape informed his intimate and acoustic-based sounds. As he made the move to the West Coast, the inclination toward music followed.
As a music industry major, the now USC graduate started exploring the possibilities with songwriting and music production. For the budding artist, the process was satisfying as he realized his capability to execute projects independently.
At the time, Fleischman shared that he was influenced by the likes of Toro y Moi, Sylvan Esso and James Blake. After reflecting on the direction of his sound, Fleischman focused on creating music that would speak to him even if he wasn’t the one who made it. 
“I’ll find a little snippet that’s like really sick, and then I’ll drag it into another session and like that will start the next song,” Fleischman said. “There’s like one thing that connects every single song I’ve ever put out that no one would ever hear.” 
The interrelation between the songs serves as testimony to Fleischman’s attentiveness into each work released, even if it’s only for himself. 
During his time at USC, Fleischman connected with Nikoli Partiyeli, a USC alumnus and Los Angeles-based creative. The two often partnered with each other to execute their original ideas.
“I bounce ideas off him. He’d bounce ideas off me,” Partiyeli said. “And then we’d kind of meet in the middle with things and then we would just go do it.” 
The 2019 release “Greyhound” encapsulates the ease and flexibility they worked under.
As Fleischman was driving over to visit, Partiyeli sent a demo for him to listen to. By the time Fleischman reached Partiyeli’s place, he had a verse ready to go.
The two wasted no time recording Fleischman’s verse, deciding then to shoot a music video and prepare for a future release date.
“And so like, same day, within like an hour, we filmed the music video,” Partiyeli said. “I edited it. And then we wrapped it up.” 
The workflow between the two was always high-speed, while never compromising the quality of the art itself. Partiyeli has worked on additional Boy Willows projects, including the cover art for the 5-track EP “oof” and directing the “Crool” music video.
“I like the way we work,” Partiyeli said. “It is always really fluid and easy.”
After graduating from USC, Fleischman found himself working as a video jockey in live event production. With visual direction and lighting experience, he started touring with artists such as Alan Walker, Dillon Francis and Wallows.
Now with live music on pause, the multifaceted artist is channeling his energy into music. 
In July, Boy Willows released “I Love It When You Talk,” a floaty single made up of fuzzy piano chords and heavy drum tracks. The faded sound combined with Fleischman’s silvery vocals makes the off-beat song a must-listen.
The track was followed by recent single “Fila,” which featured Wallows frontman, Dylan Minnette. The mellowed song served as a self-described therapy session for the two. 
“Landon first played me the song when we were sharing a tour bus together,” Minnette said. “He asked me if I wanted to throw on a verse myself and … the melodies I wanted came to me immediately.” 
The result is a natural collaboration that seemingly incorporates the sonic style of each individual. Paired with subtle harmonies, the candid songwriting cuts through the hazy production.
When it came time to develop accompanying visuals, Fleischman partnered with Seannie Bryan, a L.A.-based cinematographer.
“Landon is a great collaborator because he has such a clear vision of what he wants,” Bryan said. 
As a cinematographer, Bryan was able to head logistics of the shoot granting Fleischman the headspace to direct.
On what Bryan recalled being an extremely hot morning, the team arrived at Elysian Park at 6 a.m. Having to stop only once (when Fleischman got dizzy from spinning for the opening shot) the video was complete in a short hour and a half.
Their previously established rapport led to straightforward execution and streamlined production. 
“That’s what I like about working with friends that are musicians,” Bryan said. “It’s not a big involved process.”
While on the road, Fleischman, alongside touring band member Danny Ferenbach, ad-libbed a song. The duo released the song “Crabwalk,” under the moniker Party in the Hills. The impromptu song has reached over 100,000 streams on Spotify.
Completely improvised and humorous, the lighthearted track proved to Fleischman the worth in incorporating playfulness into his work.
“[‘Crabwalk’] is a sign that I should just try to be as much as myself as possible and like try to showcase all aspects of myself, not just like brooding or introspective,” Fleischman said.
Fusing his creative talents, Fleischman continues to elevate his artistry with each release. With the future projects on the horizon, Boy Willows invites listeners to take on honest perspective-taking with a notion of kindness.
“I would love for people to be more present with each other as a result of listening,” said Fleischman. 
With an electric and hypnotic blend of synths, Fleischman is doing more than standing out amid new indie acts. 
The single “Fila” and its accompanying music video are out now.
