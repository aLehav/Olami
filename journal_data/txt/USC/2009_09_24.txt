Shoppers who frequent Superior should consider adding a flu shot to their grocery list.
On Sunday, the Superior Grocers in the University Village will offer seasonal flu shots — administered by Onsite Wellness — to employees, students and local residents.
Alan Derow, benefits manager of Superior Grocers, said although the flu shots are not aimed primarily at students, it’s a good idea for them to consider getting the shot.
“It’s important for students to get the shot for two reasons,” Derow said. “We’re trying to do our part.”
Though the University Park Health Center has no role in Superior’s decision to administer flu shots, Corinne Ash, a program specialist at the health center, said it’s good to have other places in the community giving out the shots.
“The more people getting flu shots the better,” Ash said.
The flu shots will be administered outside the supermarket for both sanitary and space reasons, Derow said.
Some students expressed trepidation about getting a flu shot from a grocery store as opposed to a health clinic.
“I wouldn’t go to Superior because I’d prefer to go to a medical establishment for my flu shot,” said Colleen Brosnan, a sophomore majoring in international relations.
Other students, however, said they would consider getting a flu shot at Superior because of the convenience.
“If I needed to get a flu shot, I would get it at Superior,” said Mohamed Alloo, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “Superior is a lot closer to my dorm than the health center.”
Superior’s shoppers and employees had only good things to say about the market’s flu shot program.
“Superior is a very good market. It offers flu shots at a very good price,” said Yolanda Hernandez, an area resident who has gotten a flu shot at Superior before.
Constance Matthews, a Superior employee, has received her vaccination from Superior before and plans to get her shot there this year. She said offering flu shots is good for the whole community.
“The flu shots are benefiting everyone, because many people do not get their flu shots,” she said. “This way, they can just come do their shopping and get their flu shots while they’re here.”
Derow said he is not sure how many people will show up to get flu shots this weekend, but said the provider could probably give shots to up to 300 people in three hours.
Although Superior currently only offers the seasonal flu vaccination, Derow said Superior might be able to give out different shots in the future.
“The H1N1 vaccine is a big question mark. If our provider gets the vaccine from the government, then we would think about having another flu shot campaign with the H1N1 vaccine,” he said.
Superior is trying to make sure that its vaccinations are more affordable than what its competitors are offering. Stores such as Walmart and Walgreens are offering flu shots that might cost as much as $25, but Superior’s shots will cost $20 and only $15 for students or faculty members with USC IDs. Flu shots from the USC pharmacy cost $25.
Derow is anxious to find out if Superior’s efforts for his employees, the community and students pay off.
“It is kind of exciting,” he said. “I hope that the turnout is good because I think the community needs to be vaccinated for the flu.”
[…] of fish I want to comment on hits particularly close to my current home – USC. According to The Daily Trojan, Superior Grocers plans to start selling and administering flu shots to its customers this weekend. […]

For the USC women’s cross country team, the most important day of the season thus far has arrived. On Saturday, the Women of Troy will compete in the Stanford Invitational, the race that coach Tom Walsh has pointed to multiple times as the crux of the cross country campaign.
“This is our first big test of the year,” Walsh said. “The first two meets [at Fullerton and Irvine] were just to see where we were at.”
High hopes · With the return of the USC women’s cross country team’s star runner Zsofia Erdelyi, the Women of Troy expect much better results at the Stanford Invitational than at their first two competitions. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
The main reason that Saturday will be a test for USC is the presence of several top-notch programs. Host Stanford is ranked No. 5 in the nation entering the invitational, and teams from UC Davis, Loyola Marymount and Sacramento State all represent regionally ranked teams from the West.
“At Stanford it’s a much higher-level meet,” Walsh said. “In addition to great teams from California we’ll see a lot of great out-of-state girls who can really run. It’s a good chance for our girls to test themselves out.”
Walsh also noted that with the rise in competition comes the need for USC to rise to the challenge.
“I expect for the level at which we race to be much higher than it was the past two races,” he said. “Much higher.”
Part of that expectation stems from the return of standout junior Zsofia Erdelyi, who missed USC’s first two races with a foot injury. Erdelyi, who last year qualified for the NCAA Championships, adds star power to a consistently strong USC squad in need of a top-five quality runner.
“[Zsofia’s return] will be very positive because she’s the heart and soul of our team,” Walsh said. “Obviously she won’t be at 100 percent for this meet, but she’s so talented that she could be as high as fifth or sixth in this race and it wouldn’t surprise me.”
Walsh’s confidence would appear to be well placed. The course that the Women of Troy will run Saturday is the same course that Erdelyi ran last year to finish in the top 10 in regionals and qualify for nationals.
Erdelyi isn’t the only runner whom Walsh expects to make a comeback on Saturday. Team captain Bridget Helgerson, who had what Walsh called a “poor” race at Irvine two weeks ago, is looking to restore her status as one of USC’s top three runners.
“Last week was definitely a wake-up call for Bridget,” Walsh said. “She’s lucky she got her bad race out of the way. It’s really motivated her to train better and work hard during these past two weeks. I’m expecting her to bounce back.”
Walsh expects the two-week race layoff to benefit not just Helgerson, but the entire team.
“When you have a meet on Saturday, you don’t push as hard at the end of the week because you want the girls’ legs to be fresh. So this week off allowed us to do some intense training. I’m excited to see where we’re at,” Walsh said.
USC will see exactly where it is at when the gun goes off at 11 a.m. in Palo Alto on Saturday.

Although it was proven last weekend that the USC men’s water polo team is, in fact, mortal, the Trojans still have every opportunity to retain the one title that truly matters: national champion.
The next step in moving closer to a second championship in just as many years begins this weekend, when the Trojans make their debut at home with a doubleheader against Pepperdine and Long Beach City College.
Deadly assault · USC two-meter Shea Buckner leads the Trojans’ offensive attack this week in a major test against Pepperdine. The Trojans are coming off their first loss in two seasons after falling 5-4 to UCLA. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“I can’t wait for it. Friends, family … I’ve been telling [everyone] to come to our game, come support us,” sophomore two-meter Matt Burton said. “I really think you’ll see a huge bout out here. Pepperdine is always a fun team to play.”
The Trojans will have their hands full against a strong Pepperdine team that finished the 2008 regular season ranked No. 2. USC won all three matches between the two teams in 2008, but two of them were decided by a single goal, including a 3-2 win over the Waves in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championship game that secured the title for the Trojans.
Pepperdine lost two of its top performers from last season but has managed to stay ranked in the top 10 every week this season, despite poor showings in both the Triton Invitational and NorCal Tournament. Coach Jack Kocur returns for another season with the Waves, a year after the MPSF voted him Co-Coach of the Year alongside USC’s coach Jovan Vavic.
This weekend’s matchup with the Trojans will be the Waves’ first MPSF game of the year.
USC enters the weekend with an overall 8-1 record, with its only blemish stemming from a close loss to UCLA in the semifinal round of the NorCal Tournament. Before the defeat, the Trojans were riding a 36-game win streak that dated all the way back to the first match of the 2008 season.
“We had a very long meeting when we came back to practice on Tuesday, where we outlined all the problems that were inherent in both the team chemistry and dynamic, as well as the game plan and execution,” Burton said of the Trojans’ preparation after the loss. “I think now we’ve gotten past [the loss] and identified a lot of things that were wrong with our team, and we’re definitely looking to move on.”
Immediately after the Pepperdine match, the Trojans face off in a scrimmage against Long Beach City College. The game was recently scheduled as an opportunity for additional practice for both teams, who don’t normally play each other during the course of the season. Regardless, the Trojans remain focused on their first test of the day.
“We’re definitely focused on Pepperdine,” Burton said.
The Trojans’ seniors continue to anchor the team on both sides of the ball, accounting for four of USC’s top five scorers and a large part of the defense that has allowed only 39 goals so far this season. Six of the seven seniors (excluding goalkeepers) scored at least once in the tournament, and all seven have three or more goals this year alone.
In addition, sophomore goalkeeper Joel Dennerley has been steady, offering reassurance that the position will be well-manned for the next couple of seasons. Dennerley had 22 saves during the NorCal Tournament, raising his season total to 52 in nine games.
Despite the end of its winning streak, this weekend marks an opportunity for a new one to begin.
“I think we just have to get back to the basics,” Dennerley said. “We got away from some things we were doing last year as a team that made us so successful. We’ve had a really good week of practice so far. Things have definitely improved and we’re more than ready for Pepperdine this weekend.”

Looking to build on a season-high four-game winning streak, the USC women’s soccer team heads north this weekend to take on Pacific and No. 9 Santa Clara.
The Women of Troy started off the season 1-3, but have rebounded in the last two weeks behind improved defensive play.

The absence of senior All-American defender Meagan Holmes and the season-ending knee injury sustained by her replacement junior Ashli Sandoval have forced the other young members of the backline to step up.
USC has posted three shutouts in its last four games, including two on the road against Oklahoma and Oklahoma State.
“The ladies are growing up,” coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We still have areas where we need to improve but we’re definitely a lot better than we were in week 1.”
The Women of Troy will be without starting sophomore leftback Chelsea Buehning for the match against Pacific, as she must sit out one match following the red card she received in USC’s last game.
Starting in her place will most likely be freshman Kelly Morgan, who will line up alongside junior Karter Haug, sophomore Claire Schloemer and fellow freshman Stephanie Morgan.
Pacific enters the 7 p.m. Friday match on a three game unbeaten run. The Tigers (5-2-2) lost to Pac-10 foe Cal 3-0 earlier this season in an exhibition.
Pacific is led by Maricela Padilla and Angelica Figueroa, two young and talented midfielders. Padilla, a freshman, leads the team with six goals and also has two assists. Figueroa, a sophomore, has posted four goals and a team-leading six assists.
USC will take on Santa Clara (7-2) on Sunday at 1 p.m., in what could be one of USC’s most challenging games this season.
The Broncos have already knocked off two top-10 foes this season, beating at the time No. 5 Notre Dame and No. 7 Purdue.
Santa Clara features a balanced scoring attack, with nine players having scored goals for the Broncos this season.
USC defeated Santa Clara 2-1 a year ago at McAlister Field and leads the all-time series with the Broncos 4-1.
The Women of Troy will rely heavily on the play of their senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen this weekend, both for her shot-stopping and her organization skills.
Olsen has helped lead the young backline and received the Pac-10 Player of the Week award for her two shutouts in the victories over Oklahoma and Oklahoma State last weekend.
She said the biggest improvement the team has made since the beginning of the season has been greater composure and intelligence on the field.
“We know all the answers to what we’re supposed to do and how to play good soccer,” Olsen said. “It’s just actually applying it in a game.”

The No. 13 USC women’s volleyball team (11-1, 0-0) looks to extend its 11-match winning streak this weekend as it opens Pac-10 play in Arizona against No. 19 Arizona (11-0, 0-0) and Arizona State (10-2, 0-0).
Since dropping their first match of the season against Michigan State, the Women of Troy have eased past their competition with 11 straight victories heading into conference play. But USC coach Mick Haley knows his team needs to continue its solid all-around play if it wants to have success against the stronger teams in the Pac-10.

“I expect us to play hard,” Haley said. “I look forward to opening the conference and playing these two teams. I think the whole fun of college volleyball is getting to the meat of your schedule and getting challenged. I expect some good battles.”
USC opens the weekend in Tucson against Arizona tonight at 7 p.m. The undefeated Wildcats are hitting .264 as a team with a 13.16 kills per set and 2.24 blocks per set average. Arizona is third in the Pac-10 with a 1.68 service aces per set average.
The Women of Troy will have to contain either junior outside hitter Tiffany Owens or senior middle blocker Jacy Norton of Arizona to come out with a victory. Owens has 144 kills this season (3.89 kps) and 107 digs (2.89 dps), while Norton leads with her strong play at the net. She is fourth in the Pac-10 with 45 blocks (1.32 bps).
“We have to challenge both of those kids,” Haley said. “They’re two big point scorers for Arizona, and we have to shut down one of them and keep the rest of the team at bay.”
Unlike USC, Arizona has yet to have a letdown this season. And although USC expects to win tomorrow, Haley is the first to admit the match will be very difficult against a top-tier team in the conference.
“We can’t give them anything free, and we can’t look past them,” he said. “We have to go in there and, if we want to start the conference right, we have to be the first people to beat them.”
USC and Arizona have split their last four matches in Tucson.
Following tonight’s opening match, USC will take on Arizona State Saturday at 7 p.m. USC has won 26 straight matches against the Sun Devils dating back to 1995, but the match away from the Galen Center will present a challenge to Haley’s squad.
Arizona State is hitting .254 as a team with a 12.51 kps. The Sun Devils lead the conference with a 3.03 bps average due in large part to senior outside hitter Paige Mittelstaedt’s 58 blocks (1.29 bps).
“I think that that’s one of the keys for them. They have to block a lot of balls to win,” Haley said. “We have to be very smart and not give them a lot of opportunities to block. If we cover for our hitters well, we can hold them down there.”
Arizona State junior outside hitter Sarah Reaves may represent the strongest challenge for USC this weekend. She leads the Sun Devils with 181 kills (4.31 kps) and is second in the Pac-10 with a 5.04 points per set average.
“We have a lot of respect for Sarah, really a fine player for them,” Haley said. “She has to have one of her best games every night if they’re going to win.”
The return of USC junior outside hitter Kimmee Roleder — who missed last weekend’s victories against Portland and Fresno State — to accompany the strong play of sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter will help USC in Arizona. Senior outside hitter Jessica Gysin remains a game-time decision tonight as she is still nursing a hamstring injury that kept has kept her out of the last two matches. If she can’t play, junior Geena Urango or freshman Katie Fuller will replace Gysin in the lineup.
Regardless of who is on the court for USC, Haley is sure his team is ready to compete in a tough conference that has a whopping seven teams ranked in the top 25 this season. USC’s quest for a Pac-10 title begins tonight.
“It’s going to be hard because we really haven’t been challenged yet,” Haley said. “Both of these games will be a real intense challenge for us. We just have to step up and take that challenge.”

One thing is for sure — there are no ifs, ands, or buts about it this time.
Unlike last week, freshman Matt Barkley is certifiably the starting quarterback this Saturday, when the No. 12 Trojans (2-1) host struggling Washington State (1-2).
Back in action · After a shoulder injury held freshman quarterback Matt Barkley out of the lineup last week in Seattle, Barkley is back behind center this Saturday looking to help the Trojans rebound. - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan
This comes in direct contrast to USC coach Pete Carroll’s method last week, when he declined to publicly name a starter with Barkley severely limited in practice and backup Aaron Corp tentative in practice.
Corp, a redshirt sophomore, told reporters after the game — his first career start — that he was never officially told he would be the starter.
Of course, the Trojans lost to Washington on the penultimate play of the game, 16-13.
Since then, USC has dropped nine spots in the Associated Press Top-25 poll and the public’s approval of the team — and Carroll’s coaching — has noticeably decreased.
Carroll took full responsibility in Seattle, pointing only to himself when asked who was to blame.
Senior safety Taylor Mays has yet to take part in 11-on-11 drills since suffering a right knee sprain against Ohio State on Sept. 12. Starting junior weakside linebacker Malcolm Smith is likely out for the Washington State tilt with a high ankle sprain.
But not all is gloomy in the land of Troy.
Collectively, the USC defense, which Carroll called “really good” in his Tuesday press conference, ranks 12th among all Football Bowl Subdivision schools in yards allowed per game.
And on offense, the Trojans have nearly doubled what their defense has allowed in yards.
Sitting on the schedule after Washington State is a date with No. 6 Cal next weekend.
But USC is adamant to not look past Saturday’s game first.
“Washington State comes off a very dramatic and resounding and very exciting comeback win,” Carroll said. “It was really a great effort, and one that I know they’re excited about and have worked hard to deserve and all.”
The Cougars outlasted Southern Methodist 30-27 last Saturday. They came back from trailing 27-13 in the fourth quarter to win on a 39-yard field goal by Nico Grasu in overtime.
“This is an improved football team,” Carroll said. “They come into the Coliseum, hopefully we’ll play very well against them and make it very difficult on them to keep their positive stuff from happening.”
Of course, the Cougars will be without the services of their leading rusher, junior James Montgomery, who suffered a severe leg injury in overtime of the win over Southern Methodist.
Montgomery, a transfer from Cal who made his Washington State debut this season, was rushed to the emergency room early Sunday morning when it was learned he had acute compartment syndrome, which, if untreated, can lead to amputation and even death.
Replacing him will be senior Dwight Tardy. The Walnut, Calif. native, has led the Cougars in rushing for each of the last three seasons but has averaged only 4.3 yards per carry.
Redshirt sophomore Marshall Lobbestael will start at quarterback for the Cougars. He rotated with redshirt senior Kevin Lopina for the first two games but took over the job full-time last Saturday.
Washington State second-year head coach Paul Wulff spoke highly of Lobbestael in his Tuesday press conference.
“We just felt like we needed more of a spark in our game and I think that Marshall Lobbestael can do that for us and we wanted to give him an opportunity,” Wulff said. “He’s coming off an injury from a year ago that sidelined his season and he seems to be kind of slowly making it back and getting more and more comfortable.”
Against SMU, Lobbestael completed 24-of-52 passes for 239 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions.
On defense, Washington State boasts two award-winners at linebacker. Senior Andy Mattingly, a former defensive end, was all All-Pac-10 Honorable Mention as a sophomore. Sophomore outside linebacker Louis Bland, a Phil Steele Freshman All-American Third-Team last season, is undersized at just 5-foot-10, 202 pounds but is known as a rising star in the Pac-10.
That said, it’s likely that Washington State will be overmatched come Saturday.
Last season’s matchup between these two teams saw USC win 69-0 on the road.
“We’re facing a very, very talented football team,” Wulff said. “They’re well-coached and it’s going to be a heck of a challenge.”
Haha, I think it’s funny that USC is actually taking this game seriously. Carroll is fooling himself if he’s calling that Southern Methodist game an impressive win. This is Washington State we’re talking about. They haven’t had a winning record since 2003. If USC loses this game, they should be dropped (and banned) from the top 25 for the rest of the season.

Ever since I can remember, Lisa Leslie has been the face of women’s basketball. The star from Compton was one of those figures that never seemed to age. If there was a women’s basketball game on TV, be it a WNBA or an international game, chances were Leslie was right in the middle of it.
But those days will soon be nothing but memories and tape reels. Because tonight could be the last game the greatest women’s basketball player and one of the best USC athletes in history will play. Leslie has said she’ll retire at the end of this season, and with the Los Angeles Sparks facing playoff elimination from the Phoenix Mercury, it could be the last chance to see Leslie set up in the post or knock a jumper down from 15 feet.

It might surprise you to learn that the three-time WNBA MVP is only 37 years old. She’s been so dominant for so long, it feels like she came from the Paleolithic era. In an age when athletes are still competing as they reach their 40s (Dara Torres won an Olympic silver medal in swimming at the ripe age of 41 in Beijing last year), it sure seems plausible that Leslie could continue to play for a few more years. But the 6-foot-5 center has done so much in her career, it’d be a bit selfish to ask her to stay.
And why should she stay? She has won four Olympic gold medals, more than any women’s basketball player in history, and two WNBA championships. She is only one of four players left from the inaugural season of the WNBA in 1997, and she is the league’s all-time leading scorer and rebounder. While at USC, she became the first player in conference history to be named to the All-Pac-10 team all four years, and she was an All-American for three of those years. She also won the Naismith Award in 1994.
Oh yeah, she was also the first player to ever dunk in a WNBA game.
It was her play, as well as her attractive personality, that made her the perfect ambassador for the game. After 13 years in the league, the ambassador hasn’t lost her charm.
“Hi, my name is Lisa,” she said at a news conference following the Sparks’ win in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals last week. “I’m not sure if you guys had any questions for me, but I thought I’d come in.”
You cannot measure Leslie’s impact on women’s basketball. She was one of the first players to make of name for herself in high school, as she actively tried to break Cheryl Miller’s record of 105 points in a game (she scored 101 in the first half, then the opposing team failed to come out for the second half). She dominated at USC, but after graduating, she found there was no place for women basketball players in the States.
So she moved to Italy for a year and played there, but came back in 1996 to capture the gold medal in the Olympics in Atlanta. The United States was still without a league, and she thought her career was over before it even started.
“At that moment, I thought I had retired from basketball,” Leslie told The New York Times last month.
Thankfully, her retirement was postponed 13 years. Because after the Olympics, she played a big part in instituting the WNBA.
Ever since that inaugural season in 1997, Leslie has been scoring baskets and inspiring young players around the country. If it wasn’t for her, there might not even be a WNBA, and once-in-a-generation talents such as Candace Parker might be playing overseas, or not at all.
“I don’t think there’s an athlete on the court today or in this league or in youth leagues all around this country who don’t owe a debt of gratitude to Lisa Leslie, or don’t look up to her as an iconic figure in women’s basketball,” said Donna Orender, president of the WNBA, at this year’s All-Star Game. “She has been one of the great competitors, the most fierce competitor.”
Being the competitor that she is, Leslie is going out on her own terms. She had a baby two years ago and could have easily called it quits after that, but she decided to come back and play. She injured her knee early this season and could have made an excuse about being too old, and nobody would’ve questioned her.
But she’s here to win one last WNBA title. If she doesn’t, there are no plans to pull a Brett Favre or Michael Jordan. She’s done with her career and wants to spend time with her daughter and husband.
When she finally takes off her shoes for the last time, be it tonight or a few weeks down the road after her third WNBA championship, she will leave a void larger than Los Angeles in women’s basketball. There’s not a single player who can fill that void, and because of her long-lasting career and fame, she will continue to be the face of women’s basketball long after she takes off the No. 9 jersey.
She has arguably been the greatest Trojan ambassador in any sport. For that, Leslie deserves a standing ovation, and, maybe, just maybe, she could give us one last dunk.

You might want to check your facts before publishing.  Lisa Leslie is not from Compton but Gardena, California….and attended school in Inglewood.
Amy,
 Lisa states on page 6 of her autobiography,  “Don’t Let The Lipstick Fool You: The Making of a Champion”, that while she was born in Gardena, she is from Compton. Check it out.

For the funding boards of USC’s Undergraduate Student Government, every new school year means a new flood of applications for financial assistance.
On Wednesday, USG held its annual funding application workshop, where officials from USG’s financial division told members of student organizations how to tap into the funding board’s $300,000 allocated budget.

“All of our funding boards’ goals are making sure we improve student life on campus,” said Kelsey Ford, the director of Discretionary Fund for USG. “It’s about maximizing that student dollar.”
USG Treasurer Appiah said they want to streamline the funding application process and better inform organizations of the various financial resources available to them.
Specifically, Appiah said he had several initiatives planned to improve efficiency in the funding process, starting with a measure to move from paper applications to online forms.
The transition, which has been in the works since last year, would allow student organizations to submit funding applications through USG’s website.
“The application gets sent to the funding directors directly. There’s no paper trail. It’s easier for us and it’s easier for [student organizations],” Appiah said. “This is one of my main goals that I want to finish this year because it will be easier for future administrations.”
The new system is projected to be in place for the spring semester, Appiah said.
For now, student clubs planning to use USG funds for their events — anything from guest lectures to community service events — have to complete the regular paper application.
To successfully complete the process, organizations are required to submit general information about their proposed event, descriptions of each expense with its corresponding invoice and a line item budget outlining projected expenses and requested funding.
When finished, these elements of the application can result in up to 30 pages of paperwork, Appiah said.
Appiah, along with the other funding board directors, used the workshop to explain the need for the various pieces of information in the application process, while also telling attendees which funding board their individual events would come under.
Diana Smith, a sophomore majoring in communication,  was one of about 70 people who attended Wednesday’s funding workshop. Though her organization, the USC Chamber Ballet Company, usually succeeded in getting USG to financially sponsor its events in the past, the process of securing those funds was lengthy.
“It was very straightforward and they told you what you had to do, but it was time-consuming getting everything we needed for the application,” Smith said.
While completing the application can become a painstaking process, the forms’ details give funding board officials confidence that student organizations will use any aid responsibly, said Kelsey Ford, director of USG’s Discretionary Fund.
“We want to make sure our money’s being spent wisely, so these checkpoints are our way of making sure that’s really being done,” Ford said.
With a combined allocated budget of $300,000 — the same amount as last year — to distribute among individual students and campus organizations that qualify for their financial support, USG’s funding boards each have an average of 15 committee members and meet weekly to evaluate applications. The Discretionary, Philanthropy, Professional, Leadership and Academic Research Funding Boards review requests that fall under their individual jurisdictions.
Each funding board has its own budget, with the Discretionary Funding Board, which finances cultural and entertainment events, typically given access to the most money since it receives the most applications, Appiah said.
Depending on their individual budgets, the funding boards have different limits regarding the amount of money student organizations can apply for every year.
Student organizations must submit funding applications at least four weeks prior to their event and give a presentation to the appropriate funding board. Committee members then discuss the legitimacy of the
funding request and vote on whether and how much to give to the organization.
Criteria for approval include meeting application
requirements and the appropriate funding board’s event guidelines, hosting an event that targets and serves all USC students and seeking to improve and expand events from year to year, Ford said.
“We’re able to look at these applications and the guidelines can decide for themselves whether the applicants qualify,” Ford said.
Emily Connors, director of USG’s Professional Fund, said hosting events catered to the entire student body is an important requirement for successful applications, primarily because the funding boards’ budget comes from the student programming fee.
“The money we are in charge of is everyone’s money, so we want to make sure it’s going towards something everyone can enjoy,” she said.
Despite the funding boards’ allocated budget, funding for returning student organizations is not guaranteed, and student leaders need to assume responsibility for applying for aid early, Ford said.
Though the lack of a budget increase might affect how much financing student organizations can expect, Appiah said he and the funding board directors will take full advantage of their resources and provide as much aid as possible.
“I want to use the money we have wisely to make sure students’ money is used effectively. But my goal this year is not to reject apps because we don’t have money,” Appiah said. “In a way, it’s a good thing if we run out of money, because it shows students are taking advantage of our resources.”

“We don’t really like tradition,” is the motto of the Bellydance Superstars, the latest cultural dance group to spread its expansive wings and propel itself into mainstream American entertainment. Although the troupe’s style originated in ancient Egypt — where it is known as raqs baladi — it could possibly be Westernized to the point of cultural extinction.
The Bellydance Superstars has a certain appeal that has enabled them to rise above any other bellydancing troupe in the world. According to the troupe’s manager, media mogul Miles Copeland III, the dancers’ appeal radiates from a combination of structure and fusion.

“It’s not really an organized dance form,” Copeland explained. “[I was the one who said] lets put it to mainstream, let’s professionalize it, let’s get dancers together to present themselves the way they’ve never been able to do before on a big stage with proper production and training, and that led to the Bellydance Superstars.”
With Copeland — who’s most famous for managing popular musician Sting — at the helm, the Bellydance Superstars is in very capable hands. Having been involved with the entertainment industry as an agent, producer and manager since the late 1970s, Copeland knows better than anyone how to produce a show that will entertain the masses — even if it is at the expense of tradition.
“We were the first to mix the tribal and the cabaret style in the same show,” Copeland said. “Tribal dancing has tattoos, heavy jewelry… it is more ominous in a sense. And the cabaret style is what you imagine traditional bellydancing to be.”
Although bellydancing is primarily an individual dance form, Copeland was able to collaborate many different dancers into a systematic production.
“Wherever you have an individual dance, there’s going to be individual elements added to it,” Copeland said.
He was also able to develop his vision of an organized group and to provide greater opportunities for the women in the troupe. This vision, he insisted, has only been made possible because of American influences.
“In the Arab world, [bellydancing] is still stuck in restaurants and it’s a tacky tourist thing,” Copeland said. “Here, it evolved into women’s empowerment and it’s almost spiritual.”
In restructuring and revolutionizing bellydance, however, it appears as though the culture of the dance may have suffered casualties, despite Copeland’s insistence that it is necessary to “look at it in the standpoint of there [being] no traditional bellydance.”
But Copeland’s description of his troupe is littered with credit to America, in particular the West Coast and Hollywood.
“The best dancers were actually American, which was surprising because one imagines bellydance coming from the Middle East,” he said.
While Copeland is certainly the expert on the topic, one wonders if this oddity is simply because Middle Eastern women were not given the same opportunities and exposure to mainstream bellydancing as American women were.
“The original  bellydance costume was not two-piece,” Copeland continued. “[Egyptians] started seeing that in Hollywood movies and they took the idea.”
Copeland believes that his American dance troupe is a leading innovator when it  comes to re-creating the image of bellydance,  transforming the style of dance from mere entertainment to a viable art form.
“We have given [bellydancing] prestige by putting it in the context of professional arts such as ballet,” Copeland explained. “Whereas in the Middle East, it does not have prestige.”
Copeland maintains that bellydancing is a metaphorical bridge between the cultural divide that plagues our world today.
“From a cultural standpoint, an Arab in the US doesn’t see very much relating to his culture,” Copeland said. “If it is dance that brings interest in a culture to us, then so be it. And music is a great cultural bridge.”
It is through this cultural convergence that the Bellydance Superstars have been able to incorporate other influences and create a fusion dance style.
“I think what happens is if an art form is interesting enough, it will translate beyond its borders,” Copeland explained. “And as it goes across borders, it picks up other influences.”

Sometimes, the news can be depressing. Other times, it can be uplifting and amusing. And then there are times when the news can be downright twisted, especially if The Daily Show gets its hands on it.
But what goes into making one of the world’s most popular news satire show? Aasif Mandvi was on campus Wednesday to tell USC how the show runs.
Faux pas · Aasif Mandvi of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart displayed his sharp wit and comedic skill during his show at Bovard Wednesday. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Billed as “Life on The Daily Show,” the event did not disappoint. In front of a packed house at Bovard Auditorium, Mandvi, the show’s senior Middle East correspondent, strolled across the stage poking fun at himself, his job and, occasionally, the audience.
“I’m here tonight to give you a little lecture that I call behind the scenes of the real fake news, aka how to [screw] with people and make them look stupid,” he said.
Trained in theater, Mandvi has acted in numerous plays and films, including his two-time Obie award-winning one-man act Sakina’s Restaurant. Despite his obvious success as an actor and comedian, Mandvi was quick to mock his notoriety on The Daily Show.
“I am the brown guy on The Daily Show,” Mandvi said. “Unless you’re homeless, of course, then I’m the guy who fired Spiderman. More homeless people come up to me and are pissed off about the fact that I fired Spiderman than any other demographic.”
Before he delved into his comedy, Mandvi addressed some of the common questions about The Daily Show.
“Let me get to the obvious questions first that people always ask me: Yes, those people that we interview really do see that [stuff] they say,” Mandvi said. “Jon Stewart is a very short man, and Rob Riggle is a she-male.”
Mandvi spoke of his own experiences working on the show instead of simply giving a play-by-play of the show’s daily filming process. This gave the event a more personal perspective, and Mandvi came across as a relatable and easygoing figure rather than an arrogant television personality. His friendly air and quick wit kept the audience entertained, even when he discussed trivial things such as walking around Minneapolis with his parents at the Republican National Convention.
One of the most intriguing elements of the evening was hearing about what goes into producing the show’s field pieces.
“A field piece requires a whole different skill set,” Mandvi explained. “It basically requires us going out into the world and leaving our souls behind… taking innocent people with kids, wives, husbands, friends and family, and completely just [screwing] up their lives. We do this very well.”
Mandvi even passed along a bit of advice from former correspondent Stephen Colbert.
“Look for the ‘[screw] the chicken moment,’” he said, defining the moment in an interview where the guests will say something that embarrasses them and exposes the absurdity of their argument.
A constant theme throughout the show was Mandvi’s ethnicity and how it plays into the segments he does. Rather than shy away from the issue, he acknowledged the role his race plays, and the stereotypes of Indians in the media.
“I started on The Daily Show in 2006… For all you freshmen, that was before the iPhone,” Mandvi joked, before going into more serious detail. “I got this call from The Daily Show basically saying they would like me to come down. They were looking for a Middle East correspondent. Initially I said ‘No, I won’t do that.’ As a brown actor who’s done Ibsen, Chekhov and Shakespeare, I knew that this day would end up with me wearing a turban, sitting crossed legged on a carpet, pretending to fly.”
Instead of making the event about negative stereotypes and racism, Mandvi took a positive approach, explaining how his race allows him to provide a unique perspective on the show. For a comedian on a fake news show, his understanding and levity on the subject displayed a rather unexpected level of wisdom.
Near the end of the show, Mandvi opened up the floor for audience questions. Mandvi verbally played with the crowd, giving some wonderfully snarky one-liners at students who hesitated with their questions.
“Who’s your favorite journalist to make fun of?” one student asked. “I ask because I’m journalism major.”
“Well, I’ll just make fun of you,” Mandvi replied.
With his casual demeanor and sharp wit, Mandvi had the audience rippling with laughter. His act never came across as a forced series of jokes, but instead felt like a friendly conversation over a few drinks.
When it comes to Mandvi and The Daily Show, things seem to be going very well for them. Between the Emmy wins earlier this week and Mandvi’s enthusiasm for what is to come in the future, the show seems more popular, successful and humorous then ever.

Intelligent isn’t a word I like to throw out all that often. It infers that a person is rational and consistently makes smart decisions. Idiot, on the other hand, I use daily. Whether it’s me or someone else, it doesn’t take much to fit that bill. So back in high school when my friend Carlton told me he amassed $1,000 worth of overdraft fees during one summer, the first words out of my mouth were, “You’re an idiot.”
Unfortunately, the age of debit cards has made the ability to balance a checkbook obsolete.
Andrew Laskowski | Daily Trojan
It’s easy to put the blame on the customer in Carlton’s situation, but the matter isn’t so black and white when a customer is in an economic bind and has to live from paycheck to paycheck. The industry argues that it’s the responsibility of the account holder to know how much he has available. Agreed. Don’t spend $20 if when you only have $10. On the other hand, banks have an ethical responsibility not to engage in practices that intentionally make customers prone to overdrafts, like Chase has been doing for years.
ATM and debit transactions for Chase accounts are grouped together at the end of the day then subsequently charged from highest debit first to the lowest. This increases the probability of an overdraft for account holders that expect transactions to be processed chronologically. Suddenly, a $6 miscalculation winds up costing $41 when the $35 penalty is added. Couple this with the fact that some institutions like Bank of America let customers rack up to 10 overdrafts a day and a consumer could be looking at $350 worth of fines. Nor does it help that these fees increased 4 percent over last year and are up from just $10 a decade ago. That’s just ripping customers off.
There’s no doubt that penalties can add up quickly, but just how often do customers overdraw? In a survey by the American Bankers Association, a reported 82 percent of the 1,000 Americans polled didn’t pay overdrafts in the past 12 months, and of those that did pay them, 96 percent were glad the bank processed their transaction anyway to avoid embarrassment.
On the surface, that looks pretty good, but the survey failed to mention the $38.5 billion the bank earned on those fees charged to 17 percent of their account holders. The fact remains banks have made a substantial amount of their profits at the expense of their poorest customer segment, which is certainly at odds with the fact that 85 percent of the nation’s wealth is held by the top 20 percent.
There are alternative ways for banks to handle overdraft fees. The most logical approach would have to be applying a fee proportional to the amount withdrawn. Banks could easily dip into a savings account when a customer’s checking account dries up or offer credit cards with a $300 limit instead, as some banks currently do. Banks for the most part, however, are steadfastly charging overdrafts and not allowing customers to opt out of the program because of the income they bring in from the associated fees.
Congress has heard the complaints. Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), the senate banking committee chairman, wants to introduce a bill requiring banks to ask permission to overdraft their accounts, rather than automatically billing them. Transactions instead would just be rejected if an overdraft was to occur.
Certainly banks are struggling right now with the economic landscape, but, as Dodd commented, “People out there are getting whacked. They should have the right to say, ‘Deny me the transaction.’”
Thankfully, government action won’t be necessary.
Banks have responded to the criticism nobly. Rather than sending some fat-cat lobbyist down to Washington, Bank of America has changed their overdraft policies to go in effect by Oct. 17 by giving customers the option to deny transactions when their accounts hit zero and plans to further limit the amount of times customers can overdraft their accounts to fight against rolling fees. Overdrafts fees less than $10 have been dropped all together. Chase plans on billing customers chronologically rather than grouping transactions from highest to lowest to protect account holders.
Hopefully now banks can get back to their old way of making money, or, as This American Life put it, the 3-6-3. Save money at 3 percent. Loan at 6 percent. Be on the golf course by 3 p.m.

Demonstrations at the University of California at Berkeley are difficult to avoid; in terms of magnitude, they are matched at USC only by solicitors and the syllabic overload that is the SoCal spell out. Berkeley, famous for being the seat of student unrest for decades, is a hotbed for indignancy — so the scene that played out on Cal’s campus yesterday, as well as on the campuses of almost all the schools in the UC system, was not unusual.
The protests’ importance, however, cannot be diluted. The third day of classes at all public universities in the Golden State was interrupted by student and faculty demonstrations against substantial tuition increases and pay cuts across the board.
Across town in Westwood, about 700 students and faculty members gathered in UCLA’s Bruin Plaza to protest; at UC Irvine, hundreds of students crowded the steps of the administration building. Berkeley, never to be outdone in the arena of public outcry, saw a crowd of between 1,500 and 2,000 at Sproul Plaza, equipped with signs that read “Don’t tread on public education” and battlecries of “Si se puede!”
Some UC students can expect to pay 44 percent more in student fees next year — a total of $10,300.
This initiative comes on the heels of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s so-called “faustian” 2004 agreement with UC President Robert Dynes, in which it was decided that student fees would increase in exchange for a long-term augmentation of UC funding.
However well-intentioned Dyne’s pact with the governator was, the fact remains that tuition increases are boosting school funds at the expense of the students, not the state. Faculty, already famously underpaid, are also largely taking the brunt of the budget cuts.
The purpose of a public education system, especially one so lauded as the UC schools, is to provide affordable education. Budget cuts cannot be battled by undercompensating faculty and increasing tuition.
USC students are not insulated from the economy’s effect on education; the school-wide hiring freeze is testament to that. In this time of economic duress, we must remember our priorities and speak out.

Remember that the choice is between them paying their tuition, or us paying their tuition. People receiving subsidies out of other people’s wallets don’t really have much of a right to complain when those other people have budget problems and have to reduce (but not cut off) the subsidies. Consider this: as a USC graduate with student loans, you will spend the next probably 15 or 20 years paying your USC tuition with interest out of your monthly paychecks. What else will you be paying for by a mandatory deduction from your paychecks? Yeah, you’ll be paying for those UCLA and Berkely students’ tuition, too.

In the film industry, the battle of sexes might better be regarded as a massacre in favor of the men.
This year, however, is arguably one of the most productive for women directors in recent memory.
At face value, the distinction “women directors” seems condescending — a “good for you” kind of backhanded compliment that suggests an imbalance between the sexes.
Such an imbalance exists, though it runs along the lines of opportunity rather than talent. The distinction between male and female directors is sadly necessary because Hollywood, through a long tradition of favoring men in the director’s chair, has built the system up this way.
In 2009, five prominent women directors — one paired with arguably the most prominent American female screenwriter — have managed to put out four films in a diverse range of genres: war, romance, horror and biography.
Kathryn Bigelow, the director behind this summer’s critical darling The Hurt Locker, deserves real credit for rewriting the most masculine of genres: the war film. Bigelow’s daring dissection of the hard-wired mind of a bomb specialist in Iraq smashed open the genre in ways too numerous for this survey to list.
While there’s still an entire season full of movies left to see this year, once the dust has cleared in January, Bigelow — aided by a supernatural performance from Jeremy Renner — might well remain the director of the year’s best film. Barring an awkward violation of the Academy’s bylaws — the film was technically released in 2008 and nominated for a few Independent Spirit Awards this year — Bigelow’s potential omission in the Best Director category would be worthy cause for a riot.
Released locally last week, Bright Star marks an about-face from Jane Campion’s 1993 masterpiece, The Piano. The story of romantic poet John Keats’ affair with a talented young woman named Fanny, Bright Star is a classic parlor romance of subdued lusts and intellectual flirtation — a far cry from the provocative sexuality of Campion’s The Piano and her underrated In the Cut. Campion also champions the notion of the woman as an artist, comparing Fanny’s free spirit and skill for fashion design with Keats’ own beloved poetry.
Campion’s film is not quite great romance, however, as she opts to understate the passion and the visuals in general. This is an effective tactic for a parlor drama, but Bright Star lacks the explosive romantic tension and joy of Joe Wright’s kinetic, beautiful version of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice — certainly the best romantic film of the past decade.
For all its visual blandness, Bright Star is the most purely poetic film since the unfairly maligned romantic comedy Shakespeare in Love. Campion’s film revels in the romantic words of John Keats and, in a stunning and effective move, allows the credits to be consumed by a reading of an entire Keats poem.
Jennifer’s Body, directed by Karyn Kusama (Girlfight) and written by ultra-popular Juno scribe Diablo Cody, is currently unseen by me — and, unfortunately for the filmmakers, most of the country.
Cody and Kusama’s film, which centers around a monstrous femme fatale, is apparently intended to be a subversion of the traditional female role in horror films. Although the film has been advertised as rife with camp and lesbian subtext, Jennifer’s Body has been subverted by the Hollywood marketing machine, and the appeal of the film’s subtext is all but lost when the majority of its advertisements air in between penis enlargement ads and Girls Gone Wild spots on late-night Comedy Central.
Unfortunately, Cody is no stranger to being co-opted by Hollywood for its own purposes. Her beloved screenplay for Juno — which I found unbearably hip way before it was cool to say so — was certainly deserving of its Best Original Screenplay Academy Award, but it was easy to see the Academy salivating at the chance to appear open-minded by letting a dyed and inked former stripper into its boys’ club: something I call the “Crash Rule.”
Last, and possibly least, is the visually talented Mira Nair, whose forthcoming Amelia looks like a fairly standard biopic with a girl-power twist — the heroine is the famous pilot Amelia Earhart. Also on the slate is first-time director Drew Barrymore, whose Whip It stars the remarkable other half of the Juno dynamo, Ellen Page. Unlike Nair’s film, Barrymore’s at least looks like it has a new and interesting angle, specifically girls’ rollerblading.
Except for The Hurt Locker, the one element each of these films shares is the privileging of the female perspective. For cinematic artisans like Campion, Kusama — whose Girlfight is a modern classic — and Nair, their films are especially valuable for their realistic portrayal of women. The potential importance of the director’s gender to a film is made apparent by these works, and complementarily of works by hyper-masculine directors like Guy Ritchie, Martin Scorsese and — going way back — Akira Kurosawa.
Something this meager list makes clear is that things need to change in Hollywood; more viewpoints need to be brought into the fray or else the industry will continue to stagnate. But Hollywood is an old stone not easily moved or eroded, and it is a wonderful and sad thing that just six prominent women artists would find their unique films released within the same year. It feels like laughable progress, but it is progress nonetheless.

As university admissions offices nationwide cut back on visits to high schools as a way of dealing with budgetary constraints, USC is taking the opposite route and increasing its number of visits in hopes of making a personal connection with more prospective students.
Timothy Brunold, the associate dean and director of undergraduate admission, said USC admissions is increasing its high school visits by 50 percent. This year, USC will conduct 1,400 high school visits compared to 850 visits during the 2008-2009 school year.
“USC wants to continue to aggressively recruit incoming freshmen, and we feel like we have a very good opportunity right now to continue building on the gains we’ve made in the last several years,” Brunold said. “We know there are still a great many students in different parts of the country and different parts of the world who would present a very good match for USC.”
But in a time of shrinking endowments and tight budgets, this uptick in high school visits goes against the grain.
Nancy Heinisch, career adviser at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, Calif.,  said the school will only host 15 colleges on its campus this September and October, compared to 25 in 2008 and 24 in 2007.
“Most schools are cutting back dramatically on high school visits. They told us at the UC Conference the other day that it’s pure economics: ‘We’re not coming to your schools,’” said Dan Blanchfield, a Saugus High School counselor.
It’s not just the UC schools that are cutting back. The Yale Daily News reported this week that Yale’s admissions office will be decreasing their number of high school visits. The admissions offices at Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dartmouth College are also reducing presentations at high schools to save money.
Brunold could not say how much USC will spend on admissions visits this year because of unpredictable factors such as gas prices, mileage reimbursements and the cost of flights. He said, however, the expenditure will definitely be more than the $250,000 annual budget of past years.
While Brunold acknowledged that USC has been practicing financial prudence in other ways, such as curtailing hiring, he said increasing high school visits is a “strategic priority for the university.” He said the university believes, by looking at where USC stands versus its competitors, that this is the right place to be investing.
“Given the current marketplace and given the current strength of USC, this certainly wouldn’t be the time to let up,” Brunold said. “We know, the data shows, that high school visits are definitely a strong determining factor in whether a student applies to a university.”
The undergraduate admissions office, Brunold said, has been lucky in its ability to increase its travel budget while that of other universities is shrinking.
“What colleges and universities have to do is take limited resources, because everyone has limited resources, and decide how they’re going to spend those resources. And that’s a challenge faced by every single university,” Brunold said. “We’re just very fortunate that we’ve been given more of an opportunity to do more of these school visits.”
In addition to 12 staffers who travel part-time to visit high schools and attend regional recruiting events, Brunold’s team is made up of about 25 people whose primary job will be to visit high schools throughout 40 states and eight countries.
The team will strategically target cities and states that Brunold described as having “untapped potential,” such as Texas, Florida, Boston, Georgia, New York, Philadelphia and Washington DC.
Even within California, Blanchfield said he thinks it is still in USC’s best interest to continue its high school visits. Students who were once in the audience for one of USC’s high school visits agree.
Cassie Rice, a recent USC graduate, said during her senior year at Beverly Hills High School, she was absolutely convinced that even though her father had attended USC, it was not the school for her.
“What’s interesting is that the fall that I applied to USC, I went to some big recruiting event at USC. During and after the recruiting event, I swore that there was no way I would go to USC,” Rice said. “Then, after the USC admissions visit … I decided to go to USC.”
Though some of the UCs are switching gears and turning to less expensive recruitment methods such as “webinars,” where prospective students can come online and interactively ask questions to recruiters, Blanchfield said it is in USC’s best interest to continue its visits.
And with the number of students entering college expected to decline in the next few years, Brunold said it is more important than ever to make that personal connection with potential students.

Coming off its first tournament of the season, the No. 9 USC men’s golf team has had little time to work out the kinks before they head north for the PING/Golfweek Invitational in Bremerton, Wash.
NCAA regulations and the elements conspired against the Trojans’ practice schedule this week. The team took a mandatory day off Monday before a heavy fog Wednesday morning blanketed the Trump National Golf Club and kept the team off the course.
With only two days of practice between tournaments, one might expect the team to be unprepared this weekend, but coach Chris Zambri said several aspects of the Gold Mountain Golf Course favor his team.
“I think it plays to our strengths in that it’s a ball striker’s course,” Zambri said. “It’s not a real old course, but it’s a traditional course with tree lines.”
Gold Mountain also mirrors the course USC played at last week, which should help the Trojans.
“It’s somewhat like where we just played,” he said. “It probably won’t play as tough, but it’s the same style of golf course.”
The course may not be as challenging as the one USC played last week but the competition will be just as stout. No. 3 Oklahoma State and No. 10 Washington headline the opposition. The Cowboys placed second last week at the Olympia Fields Invitational, 11 strokes ahead of the Trojans.
Defending NCAA champion Texas A&M, No. 21 North Carolina State ­— who is returning national player of the year Matt Hill — and No. 24 UNLV will also test the Trojans.
USC will bring the same lineup to Washington that they used last week. Freshman Sam Smith beat out redshirt junior Bo DeHuff in a qualifying round this week at practice, meaning the Trojans will once again call upon three freshmen this week.
Junior Matthew Giles, sophomore Steve Lim and freshmen Martin Trainer and T.J. Vogel round out the group.
USC spent what little practice time they had this week hitting irons and figuring out how far they were going.
“Guys worked on making sure they knew their yardages with their irons, especially the newer players,” Zambri said. “They don’t get a lot of opportunities to do that before they come here.”
If the Trojans can figure out their yardages they have a chance to do well at a course that has been good to them in the past. USC won their NCAA Regional at the course two years ago.
“We have a totally different makeup now so that’s not necessarily relevant, but as a program we have had success there,” Zambri said.
Most of that regional-winning team might be gone, but one member remains who should play a key role this weekend. Giles helped USC to a victory then as a freshman and will be counted on to do the same this year.

The No. 2 USC women’s golf team begins its quest for a NCAA title this weekend at the Mason Rudolph Championship at the Vanderbilt Legends Club in Franklin, Tenn.
The purpose of the first tournament of the season for the Women of Troy is “to give everyone some competitive experience,” coach Andrea Gaston said.
With a more experienced team this year, veteran Mason Rudolph will provide the younger players with more competitive practice, while two of the team’s three seniors have the weekend off.
Traveling to Nashville will be sophomore Jennifer Song, junior Lizette Salas, senior Caroline Kim, sophomore Inah Park and freshman Cyna Rodriguez. As individuals, returning first-team All-Americans Song and Salas are ranked first and fifth, respectively.
“I definitely want to get some wins this year,” Song said.
This weekend presents one of the better opportunities this season. Last season, the team finished second, and Song tied for third in what was her debut as a Trojan.
Rodriguez, a highly touted freshman from the Philippines, is making her Trojan debut this week. Gaston expects her to contribute immediately to the team.
“She had a strong summer and played a lot of top amateur events,” Gaston said. “She’s looking forward to our first trip.”
The Women of Troy will get an early season look at some of their top competition for the national title. The field includes 13 top-25 teams, including No. 1 Arizona State, No. 3 UCLA and No. 4 Oklahoma State.
“We definitely know we’re going to see a lot of competition with the Pac-10, especially from Arizona State and UCLA,” Gaston said. “All of our fall tournaments have really strong fields.”
The strong competition will give the younger players the experience they need for the team to be able to “count on every player,” Gaston said.
The tournament takes place Friday through Sunday.
