USC football is almost back. 
The Pac-12 CEO Group unanimously voted Thursday to carry out a seven-game conference-only fall football season, beginning Nov. 6 and culminating with a conference championship game Dec. 18.
The vote also included the resumption of all winter sports — including men’s and women’s basketball, which will begin Nov. 25, the same day the NCAA plans to officially start its basketball season.
In a press release announcing the decision, the Pac-12 cited updated testing capabilities — the conference has partnered with Quidel Corporation for daily testing with a turnaround as quick as 15 minutes — as well as decreased prevalence of the coronavirus in member communities, increased capacity to monitor cardiac issues resulting from COVID-19 and guidance from state and local health officials.
University of Oregon President and Pac-12 CEO Group Chair Michael Schill said the Thursday meeting had nothing to do with money and that financial implications were never a part of the decision to return.
“From the beginning of this crisis, our focus has been on following the science, data and counsel of our public health and infectious disease experts,” Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said in the release. “Our agreement with Quidel to provide daily rapid-results testing has been a game-changer in enabling us to move forward with confidence that we can create a safe environment for our student-athletes while giving them the opportunity to pursue their dreams.”
According to the press release, universities that utilize daily antigen testing will also administer weekly PCR tests, which detect genetic material of the virus, for each student-athlete.
“We’re moving forward now, but we’re not moving forward with our eyes shut,” Schill said in a media webinar following the announcement.
The release said that the conference agreed that both a fall and winter football season were feasible, and that the CEO Group unanimously favored the fall option.
“I am thrilled for our student-athletes, coaches, and fans that the Pac-12 Conference presidents and chancellors voted to resume athletics practices and competitions for football, basketball, and winter sports seasons,” USC athletic director Mike Bohn wrote in a statement. “We are proud of our student-athletes who made this resumption possible by their adherence to our health and safety protocols.”
Competitions on Pac-12 campuses will not permit fans, a decision that will be revisited in January.
Pac-12 teams will be eligible for selection to the College Football Playoff, and every college football team — even if they finish under .500 — will be bowl eligible. The conference-only schedule will be released in the coming days, with each team playing every team from its division and each team playing on the weekend of the Pac-12 Championship Game.
“The patience that our University leaders showed has allowed us the time to produce the safest environment possible for our student athletes,” USC head coach Clay Helton wrote in a statement. “We thank the Pac 12 Conference and their medical advisory team for not only supplying the daily testing needed but also the scientific knowledge and advice that led to today’s decision.”
The other fall sports that had initially been postponed until spring — including men’s water polo, soccer and women’s volleyball — will commence in January, and practices may occur in the fall as allowed by the NCAA.

“Real Women Have Curves”
“Real Women Have Curves” is a coming-of-age movie starring America Ferrera as the leading role of Ana Garcia. The film is based on a play of the same name by Chicana playwright Josefina López. 
The film feels like a love letter to Los Angeles. While Garcia travels from East L.A. to Beverly Hills to attend high school, the camera takes us through the familiar street art, buildings and scenery whilst a jazzy sultry song “Chica Dificil” by Aterciopelados plays. As an 18-year-old, Garcia has to decide between going to her dream college (Columbia University) and making her mother happy by staying home and fulfilling her purported gender role by becoming a wife and mother. Her mother teeters on being emotionally abusive to her daughter by constantly criticizing her weight and looks. Garcia, being the youngest of sisters, does not take the insults lying down.  
In my personal favorite scene in the film, Garcia convinces the other women working in her family’s factory to take off their clothes in the severe summer heat. They all compare bodies and laugh. The camaraderie among the women who all admit they struggle with self-love is something that made a lasting impression on me. 
Additionally, Garcia wants to be known beyond her reproductive capacities and shamelessly enjoys sex. The film is about body confidence. In Latinx households, it’s generally frowned upon to talk back to guardians, but watching Garcia stand up to her mother gave me the confidence I needed to embrace my own body despite toxic societal expectations. 
The film is now streaming on HBO Max.

“La Misma Luna” 
In 2007, Mexican-born Patricia Riggen made her feature-directorial debut with the Spanish language film, “La Misma Luna” (Under the Same Moon). The film centers around Rosario (Kate de Castillo) and her 9-year-old son Carlitos (Adrián Alonso Barona) as they dream to build a better life in the United States.
For four years, Rosario has been undocumented and working in the U.S. while Carlitos stays with his grandmother in Mexico. When his grandmother dies, Carlitos decides to cross the Mexico-U.S. border to be with his mom. Meeting a migrant worker named Enrique (Eugenio Derbez) along the way, Carlitos gains someone who cares for him and helps him overcome the dangers of being undocumented in the U.S. Cutting between the paralleled journeys of Rosario and Carlitos, both are shown experiencing first-hand the hardships and sacrifices of the Mexican immigrant experience, all while remaining hopeful that they will reunite.
The film undoubtedly displays Riggen’s connection to telling stories of immigration and its realities. In what ultimately could have been a completely somber film, this movie is filled with drama, comedy and adventure. I appreciate those moments of fear, laughter and tears because they highlight that the immigrant experience, like all human experience, is multifaceted, consisting of a plethora of different emotions. Riggen humanizes the characters, allowing the audience to put a face to the immigrants that so often become statistics. An overall heartwarming film, “La Misma Luna” serves as a beautiful reminder that no matter where in the world someone you love is, you are both always under the same moon.
The film is available to stream on Amazon and STARZ through Hulu.

“Roma”
In the critically-acclaimed film “Roma,” Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón guides viewers in a striking story of domestic life. Set against social unrest in 1970s Mexico, the movie follows the life of Cleo, a live-in housekeeper of a middle class family. Captured in digitized black and white, the otherwise mundane plot transforms into a remarkable portrait of everyday life. In true Cuarón fashion, the use of the long one-shot throughout the film, develops a stunning visual for viewers.
Readily available on the Netflix streaming platform, the film itself was nothing short of a game changer. The new found accessibility to a wide-range audience makes it so compelling. The cast itself mostly consisted of non-actors, including the standout Yalitza Aparicio. Her performance landed her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, making her the first Indigenous American woman to be considered. 
The film tackles the manner in which crucial societal movements manifest themselves in the personal. “Roma” distinguishes itself by focusing on the commonalities of life. Cuarón’s film is an immersive experience that asks viewers to actively reflect on their own memories rather than nostalgia.

“Güeros”
Set during the 1999 Mexican student strikes against the National Autonomous University of Mexico, “Güeros” is a coming-of-age movie that encapsulates the tumultuous, subversive nature and unbounded potential of young people. 
Shot in black and white, “Güeros” chronicles a significant moment in Mexican history while following the story of Tomás (Sebastián Aguirre), his brother Federico (Tenoch Huerta) and their friend Santos (Leonardo Ortizgris). The trio embark on a roadtrip to find the musician Epigmenio Cruz (Alfonso Charpener), who, according to Tomás, once made Bob Dylan cry. 
Director and screenwriter Alfonso Ruizpalacios does not shy away from social criticism in “Güeros,” as depicted by his decision to touch on themes such as misogyny and colorism that are rampant in the Latinx community. Ruizpalacios constantly brings up the question of power dynamics throughout the movie, as shown by the slurs directed at people with darker skin, the mistreatment and intentional erasure of women’s voices and the suppression of students’ rights. 
“Güeros” also discusses classism throughout the movie by addressing the privileged backgrounds of certain characters and juxtaposing the lack of resources of low-income communities with the grandeur and hedonism of the elite. 
In one of the movie’s most profound scenes, a banner hangs off one of the walls that leaves the viewer with a central message — “Ser joven y no ser revolucionario es una contradicción” — to be young and not a revolutionary is a contradiction. 
“Güeros” is available to stream with a Sling premium subscription or to rent from Amazon Video and iTunes.

“Como caído del cielo”
“Como caído del cielo” is nostalgia set to a modern tempo. Legendary Mexican actor and singer Pedro Infante (Omar Chaparro) returns to life on Earth after decades in purgatory. God has given him one more shot to right his wrongs as a womanizer and make his way to heaven by fixing the life of Pedro Guadalupe Ramos (also played by Chaparro), an Infante imitator. 
Director and USC alumnus José Pepe Bojóroquez weaves themes of modernity, feminism and machismo into this light-hearted comedy-drama-musical. Though the movie truly only touches the surface of these topics, it pays respect to such a well-known legend in a way that celebrates the good he brought to the world while also acknowledging his imperfect past. The movie contradicts Infante’s line from his 1957 film “Pablo y Carolina,” “yo sigo siendo soltero, la casada es mi mujer,” “I continue to stay single, the married one is my wife,” which is referenced in the film. Infante’s journey demonstrates the power women hold and the importance of acknowledging one another’s humanity — lessons he learns from Guadalupe’s wife (Ana Claudia Talancón) and his own granddaughter (Yare Santana).
Throughout this 2019 Netflix film, Chaparro brings Infante alive through classic songs and movie references. “Como caído del cielo” touches the hearts of those who grew up listening and watching the legend. It reminds me of days spent watching Infante’s movies with my grandpa, who’s loved him since his youth. It reminds my mom of growing up with my grandpa, listening to his rancheras blast throughout the house.
“Como caído del cielo” is currently streaming on Netflix.

“My Family”
“My Family” is a 1995 film that centers around the Sanchez family, a Mexican American family living in East Los Angeles. Narrated by the eldest son Paco (Edward James Olmos), the film begins with Jose (Jacob Vargas) starting a family with his wife Maria (Jennifer Lopez) in East L.A. in the early 1930s after emigrating from Mexico. The film depicts the family over the course of the next several decades as they deal with social and political turmoil, such as racial tensions, gang fights and mass deportations. During all of this, the family is tested as the children grow up and deal with all the trials and tribulations life brings.
“My Family” is a beautiful film that utilizes great acting, wonderful cinematography and a memorable soundtrack to capture what makes the idea of family, especially Latinx families, so compelling. The film does a great job exploring the difference in ideologies between Latinx immigrants and their more Americanized children. It is a great representation of the struggles so many Latinx immigrants and first-generation Latinx Americans go through.
Despite these struggles, the movie emphasizes the importance of “la familia” and how those people can help a person get through anything. Dealing with themes of loss, fatherhood and redemption, “My Family” hits the entire emotional spectrum. It is one of those few movies that can make you laugh in one scene and cry in the next.
“My Family” is available to watch on YouTube.

Pose
Set in 1980s New York City, “Pose” follows Blanca Rodriguez (MJ Rodriguez), a Puerto Rican transgender woman, who develops a “house,” a home with a chosen family that financially supports and uplifts LGBTQ+ youth who have been shut out by their biological families. Rodriguez becomes a house mother to a talented group of lost youth, including Damon (Ryan Jamaal Swain), Angel (Indya Moore) and Lil Papi (Angel Bismark Curiel). Rodriguez’s protections come with a caveat: Each of the members of the house must work and compete in balls, competitive fashion and lip syncing shows that laid the groundwork for the modern drag shows that we know today. Yes, you read that right: Drag culture comes from Black and Latinx trans women. While doing so, each of the members of the family faces their own set of challenges, including battling HIV and AIDS and the stigma that came with it, along with racial discrimination, transphobia and the loss of loved ones. When tackling those issues, “Pose” confidently struts through these issues, offering a nuanced portrayal of trans women of color and distinguishing the toxicity of transphobia and racism within the often homogenized LGBTQ+ community. The House of Evangelista continues to push each other to grow beyond their circumstances with tough love. 
The show’s opening theme features MC of the balls, Pray Tell, portrayed by Emmy-nominated actor Billy Porter, as he commands “Live. Work. Pose,” a theme that guides the series throughout. The glamour of the underground balls is contrasted with the harsh up-and-coming white, young, urban-professional culture and how it deliberately rejects anything that goes against the status quo. This juxtaposition is explored through a romance between trans sex worker Angel and Trump Tower prodigy, Stan (Evan Peters).
As a huge fan of ’80s aesthetic, music and fashion, “Pose” honors African American and Afro Latinx trans women, who built and carried that very culture without praise. “Pose” delivers a poignant message to stand tall and choose the life you want and need for yourself.  
Next time you listen to Madonna’s 1990 hit, “Vogue,” take a moment to remember the Black and Latinx women who had to vogue for their soul’s survival.
As we eagerly await season three, seasons one and two of the FX show are now available to stream on Netflix.

Amid deteriorating United States-China relations in recent months, hostility against Chinese students in the U.S. has reached new highs. This decline in relations has manifested not only in daily life but in higher education as well. Recently, a Syracuse University chemistry professor was placed on administrative leave for allegedly writing “Wuhan flu” and “Chinese Communist Party Flu” in his syllabus notes. It was an incident students said reflected yet another example of racism against Chinese students during the coronavirus pandemic. 
In order to take steps toward bridging the divide between the U.S. and China, USC must tailor its education accordingly. That includes being receptive to all forms of cross-cultural exchange on a University-wide scale. Cross-cultural education is not only an integral part of supporting Chinese international students at USC, but it also enriches our understanding of the cultures that shape USC as a global university. 
The larger anti-China narrative has been exacerbated by racist, anti-Chinese rhetoric concerning the coronavirus, including the use of the terms “kung flu” and “Chinese virus.” Chinese international students are particularly vulnerable to this rhetoric. According to a recent BBC article by journalist Zhaoyin Feng, many Chinese international students have been shocked by the racial harassment they have experienced in the wake of the pandemic. With many of these students left unable to return home due to travel restrictions, they often feel isolated from both countries, unsure of where to turn. 
Furthermore, as evidenced by the Trump Administration’s decision to shut down the Fulbright scholarship programs in China, cross-cultural education is often one of the first scapegoats for political tensions. Consequently, USC must ensure that it is facilitating platforms for open discussion about the U.S.-China relationship in consideration of its status as a global university.
For one, the USC US-China Institute is an acclaimed part of the University that aims to cultivate global forums for dialogue about the evolving, multi-faceted U.S.-China relationship. In addition to offering China-centered public programming, the Institute also provides digital resources dedicated to a greater understanding of the country from political economics to cultural practices. Professors, especially those teaching courses with a global focus, should clearly advertise these opportunities to their students. 
Making attendance at the US-China Institute’s events available for extra credit, for example, could provide an incentive for students to improve their own cross-cultural understanding of China. Such an initiative from professors would demonstrate that Chinese culture and perspectives at USC are valued and integral to the University’s educational foundations. 
Moving forward, USC must also welcome conversations between Chinese international students and U.S. students amid the decline of the U.S.-China relationship. Inevitably, it may be more challenging to facilitate these conversations over online learning, but it is still important that these platforms are made accessible and visible to USC students.
The Chinese-English Language Exchange, for instance, is a student organization at USC that aims to provide a shared space for students to practice not only their English and Chinese skills but also develop a nuanced understanding of Chinese perspectives. It is essential that the University actively publicize organizations such as this to the student body so that students are made aware of the many benefits that a multi-dimensional education can bring. 
While it is unlikely that every class across the University can implement such an endeavor in their class structure, a common theme of cross-cultural education must be incorporated in all courses, regardless of content. U.S. students ought to be more open to perspectives shared in class that are not necessarily centered around the Western gaze. Likewise, Chinese international students can listen to the perspectives of their U.S. student counterparts and respond accordingly. Such sharing can illustrate the commonalities between cultures and create a space to openly talk about differences — a key element of conflict resolution on both domestic and global scales. 
By fully considering its capacity for nuanced perspectives on China, USC can place itself in a position to enact change not only domestically but on the international stage as well.

With Fall 2020 semester classes being conducted entirely online, students and faculty have found themselves facing the computer screen for hours instead of having face-to-face interactions with each other. From taking classes and completing homework to participating in campus activities, students have to fully rely on the internet — or the virtual environment nicknamed “Zoom University.” Although the internet is able to provide an alternate option for students to study in safety during the pandemic, it also has some negative effects that students and faculty should be aware of, one which has to do with physical wellness.
Using a digital device excessively may cause eye discomforts. The American Optometric Association refers to this as “computer vision syndrome,” which includes a number of vision-related problems caused by “prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader and cell phone use.” Some of the symptoms include eye strain, blurry vision, dry eyes and headaches. Staring at a screen closely may even worsen myopia, also known as nearsightedness. Although some people can quickly recover from eye discomfort, others who already have certain vision problems may find it harder to get back to normal. 
The same article from the American Optometric Association also mentioned that, because the viewing distances and angles people utilize digitally are distinct from traditional reading, the digital screen actually places more stress on the visual system and often significantly affects people’s comfort and performance on the computer. In this case, students’ attention may also be easily diverted when they are irritated by blurry vision or trying to rub their dry eyes. This discomfort may result in the reduced effectiveness of online learning.
Besides eyes and vision, students’ wrong postures in front of the computer also pose potential health risks. Sitting slouched for a long period of time can create neck, shoulder and back pains that make people more lethargic. For international students who want to synchronously engage with campus activities and socialize with their classmates to a greater extent, they may have to stay up late to attend the live sessions. This leads to disruptions in the sleep cycle, causing low energy levels and hindering mental functioning. These problems, once again, mean students may find it harder to concentrate on their tasks.
Even though online learning is the best choice for students during the pandemic, its negative impacts should not be ignored. The University has already taken active measures to help students reduce mental pressures by providing mental health counseling and focus groups. The administration should consider paying more attention to students’ physical wellness by implementing specific policies. 
For example, students and faculty in long, live classes should be mandated to take short breaks, get some water, go to the restroom, stand up, do some stretches or turn their eyes away from the digital screen. Implementing these breaks into the class schedule can help reduce students’ feeling of exhaustion.  
An article published by Harvard Business Review suggested built-in breaks for looking away from the computer to combat Zoom fatigue and reduce eye strain. USC can also provide recordings for guest speaker events or adjust the time for involvement sessions so that international students do not have to stay up very late to attend. More importantly, the university ought to host lectures to educate students on what they can do to protect their eyes and improve their physical wellness. 
For students, many things can be done to prevent computer vision syndrome. While working in front of the computer, the best posture is sitting up straight and adjusting the arms’ positions to provide support for wrists while typing. Harvard Health also recommends that students sit approximately two feet away from the computer screen and make the center of the computer screen slightly lower than eye level. 
Moreover, the glare from the computer screen is harmful to the eyes but can be minimized by using anti-glare screen filters. Turning on night mode on digital devices in a darker environment can also help replace the blue light on the screen with a warmer color that is less irritating on one’s eyes. Experts have suggested the 20-20-20 rule, which entails taking a 20-second break from the screen and looking at something 20 feet away every 20 minutes to help mitigate the negative impacts digital screens have on the eyes. 
Adjusting to a whole semester of online learning is certainly not easy, which means the administration and the students should put in effort to help alleviate Zoom fatigue, eyestrain and other stress caused by online learning. Only by paying attention to their physical wellness can students better prepared for the rest of the semester.

On Sept. 10, the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans began the NFL season by locking arms among themselves in a display of unity against social injustice. What was meant to be a reverent moment of silence soon turned into a cascade of fans heckling in disapproval.
Am I surprised that Kansas City fans booed both teams on opening night? No. Like a parent who’s not mad, however, I’m just disappointed. 
Following my immediate disappointment, I couldn’t help but think, “This is the most representative image of the United States I could imagine at the moment.” 
Rewind only four years ago and Colin Kaepernick is kneeling during the national anthem in protest against police brutality and racial oppression. As more players join him, fans of the NFL begin expressing wide disapproval, including then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, who argued players who protest should be fired and leave the country. 
This past summer to now, the country has experienced a larger wave of protests that captured the attention and participation of millions. Many in power agreed there is systemic racism that the United States has to work to correct. The progress of the movement has been well-documented on social media and in news cycles.
This is why when I saw that players were still being booed, I sighed and paused for a moment. In the past, all summer and through to this current moment, millions of people made it their mission to have their voices heard, and some still have not listened. 
A central argument for those who opposed the protests was that protests needed to be done peacefully. According to data referenced in a Washington Post article, 93% of protests since the police killing of George Floyd were peaceful. This makes it abundantly frustrating when players protest peacefully and still receive disapproval. 
This leaves me wondering: When will the U.S. truly be receptive to the systemic issues it faces?
I recently read an article in The Players’ Tribune by Bill Russell, a Hall of Fame former NBA center during the 1950s-60s. In his piece “Racism is not a Historical Footnote,” he details his experience with racism in the U.S. as a Black man during the civil rights movement through today. 
Capturing the essence of racial violence in the country, Russell retells his grandfather’s story of surviving an attack by members of the Ku Klux Klan, then subsequently explaining, “Black kids today don’t grow up worried the Klan will kill them in the middle of the night — they worry the police will.”
The civil rights movement may seem distant in the past, but hearing a man recall violence from the KKK, the degrading nature of segregation and the unjust killing of Breonna Taylor all within the span of his lifetime puts things into perspective.
We are not living in a post-racial America, racism has just taken another face. 
Hearing fans preach about the greatness of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, then ridicule him and his teammates for being citizens opposed to social injustice demonstrates many fans’ dehumanizing views of athletes. 
I often hear “just leave politics out of sports,” in an effort to preserve the sense of escapism that comes with them, but now is actually the worst time to do so. 
I understand though, it might not be particularly captivating to hear legislators and media outlets argue back and forth perpetually about the multitude of issues in the U.S. During an election year, politics typically overrun the news, a trend that has been amplified with the rise of social media. 
Watching two family members go at it on Facebook is no worse than over the Thanksgiving table.
Unity and understanding are hard to come by now, but professional sports leagues have been an exemplary model that many should look to for a break from disagreement. These players standing in solidarity for social justice are not just points for your fantasy team, but citizens using their elevated status for good. Seeing them coming together like two opposing teams lined up together in protest should be a gleaming light of hope for the U.S.
Even more impressive is the image of Miami Heat power forward Meyers Leonard standing as his teammates kneel beside him, but with all three embracing each other in the moment. With his two teammates wrapping their arms around his legs and his arm on one of their shoulders, these gestures show a mutual respect and understanding.
So yes, for the foreseeable future, there will be racist resentment as U.S. politics take center stage in professional sports. And yes, there will be racism in the U.S. Instead of using sports as the distraction from racism in the country, use sports as a source of hope needed to believe that the United States can unify to move past it in the future to come.

Raymiro Gomez-Galiano is not experiencing the typical freshman year — and that’s not just because he’s taking classes remotely from his home in Palmdale, Calif. 
Between balancing an internship with e-board positions for three social justice organizations, playing trumpet for the Trojan Marching Band and binge-watching “Avatar the Last Airbender”  — not to mention navigating his first semester of classes — Gomez-Galiano runs the New Colors Project, an organization that he founded to help underserved communities through the coordination of various projects. 
New Colors is an umbrella organization with various micro-organizations, or projects, that focus on more specific social justice and equity issues. So far, New Colors has two micro-organizations: Aprende Inglés, an online school aimed at bringing free English education to low-income Spanish-speaking adults, and New Colors – New Hope, an advocacy project for individuals experiencing homelessness that will include food and clothing drives, starting with a food drive they will have with Palmdale SAVES on Oct. 4. 
“Statistically speaking I was never supposed to achieve higher education,” said Gomez-Galiano, a freshman majoring in non-governmental organizations and social change. “I was supposed to work at a factory like my mother or obtain a fast food restaurant job. But because of resources I’ve been able to get, people that I’ve been able to talk to, learn from, it’s been pushing me. I’ve been believed in, and I want to believe in others to share that same sense of growing together.”
Throughout his education, Gomez-Galiano said he has had to figure things out on his own because his parents, who emigrated from Guatemala, worked late hours and didn’t have time to learn English. His experiences growing up inspired his organization and led him to create Aprendes Inglés to help adults learn English.
“I have been basically advocating for myself throughout my education, and I feel like it’s really hard to do that when your parents don’t know English, don’t understand the whole education system,” Gomez-Galiano said. “And that way, I want to help other parents throughout California and the world be able to connect with their child.”
Gomez-Galiano launched New Colors in May as an Instagram account that highlighted social issues, resources and undocumented heroes who have helped shape their communities. But when that project died down because members stopped posting, Gomez-Galiano said he realized he wanted to give the project new life. 
The idea for an adult English tutoring program had been on Gomez-Galiano’s mind for some time, he said, since many of his mother’s coworkers had reached out to him for English tutoring. Many of them were undocumented, could not afford lessons and never had the opportunity to achieve higher education, so Gomez-Galiano said he wanted to create a program where other adults in similar positions would be able to receive free education.
Gomez-Galiano created interest forms, a plan, had his friend design a logo, then released the project on Instagram in August. Since then, over 20 volunteers and 30 students have joined New Colors, which is still expanding to new members and projects.
“One thing that I do tell my volunteers is that it is so open to share what you are passionate about,” Gomez-Galiano said, “I want to know what you’re passionate about, and I want to make that happen … it’s very open right now, we’re carving this whole organization together, creating, collaborating with things being put together and hopefully growing.”
Because New Colors is an online organization, Gomez-Galiano has been able to find students from Guatemala, El Salvador and around Los Angeles. Some of the volunteers are people Gomez-Galiano already had connections with, but about half of them found him through his Instagram account and volunteer sites. 
Jaquelin Cantu, a senior from North High School in Arizona, said that she found out about New Colors through a website called From Students For Students. She is an English tutor and the historian for New Colors and wanted to join the organization to help others from low-income backgrounds. 
“I’m a daughter of Mexican immigrants myself,” Cantu said, “Being part of [Aprende Inglés] allows me to use the gift of knowledge that I was given, growing up here in the United States, being able to speak English. We’re able to share this gift with others who, like myself, come from low-income backgrounds and might lack the opportunity to learn English because of a lack of access and opportunities. This really hit home to me when I found out about it.” 
The volunteers are divided into two groups: the English tutors and the academia task force.
English tutors meet with students to figure out their personal needs and goals. Each tutor and student pairing works in a team with an academia task force member, who helps craft their personalized curriculum. Between October through the end of November, the English tutors will meet with their students once a week on Zoom, starting with a class-wide lesson that narrows into smaller breakout rooms. 
Lula Haji, an English tutor and academia task force member, met Gomez-Galiano at a summer program two years ago. Haji said she was eager to help him with his project because she has always noticed his passion to advocate for others.
“Anybody that interacts with him can see that he has that natural and innate ability and desire to change the world,” said Haji, a freshman at USC majoring in international relations and law, history and culture. “Whether it’s through one interaction, whether it’s through this program that he created and founded, whether it’s through public speaking.”
Beyond Aprende Inglés and New Colors – New Hope, Gomez-Galiano said he is also planning a third micro-organization in collaboration with Leaders United for Change, a student-led organization that works to help the community by sharing their talents. Through that collaboration, he said he wants to provide resources and tutoring in math, science and English to low-income K-12 students, starting with schools in L.A. County.
Ultimately, Gomez-Galiano said that he hopes New Colors can become an official nonprofit — but beyond that, he hopes the organization can transform lives. 
“I see it going big,” Gomez-Galiano said. “I see it partnering up with school districts, I see it going throughout the United States, throughout underserved communities, different countries and hopefully it can be an organization that can help many lives and transform them to what they should have been given in the first place.”
Gomez-Galiano’s vision does not stop at New Colors. He said that one day he hopes to become the mayor of L.A., a congressman, then president of the United States, to help every community succeed.
“I see the potential in this world, in this country,” Gomez-Galiano said, “And I want to make sure it happens.”

In Feb. 2020, real estate development company VF Developments issued 60-day eviction notices to the tenants of 920 Everett, a Los Angeles Chinatown building home to many older Southeast Asian refugees. Forced out of their ancestral homelands by war, these tenants face displacement once again, this time during a global pandemic.
While the coronavirus has prompted Los Angeles County to freeze evictions temporarily, this is hardly a permanent solution. The temporary moratorium only protects those who are unable to pay rent due to the coronavirus, and 920 Everett’s tenants have already been paying rent. Moreover, the real issue is a loophole in the California Tenant Protection Act, which allows for no-fault evictions if the landlord claims to make “major renovations.”
In other words, these tenants are being thrown out of their houses even though they did nothing wrong.
Enter Jerome Fink, a VF Developments co-founder and executive committee member on the board of USC’s Lusk Center for Real Estate. Fink and founding partner Victoria Vu have made a career out of purchasing housing in L.A., pushing out the original tenants and selling it at remarkably higher prices, a practice symptomatic of gentrification. Vu’s LinkedIn account, in fact, proudly proclaims VF Developments’ mission: “gentrifying areas of Los Angeles and Orange County Class A building design finishes at accessible market rents to future tenants.”
These market rent prices are hardly accessible to victims of gentrification, who are most often low-income and members of marginalized communities who look to ethnic enclaves such as Chinatown for safe havens. Such neighborhoods have historically served as hubs filled with familiar people, cultures and communities, all at relatively affordable rates.
However, such enclaves have become increasingly attractive to corporations and real estate development companies like VF Developments, which purchase property in these areas to build profitable real estate ventures. The changes are obvious: sterile minimalist architecture, whispers of a “safer” neighborhood and boba that suddenly costs twice as much as before. 
The ramifications, though, extend far beyond wood-panel finishes and $6 jasmine milk tea. They look like local businesses forced to shut their doors, their closure rooted in surging market rates. They look like people ripped from their homes, composing the larger trend of displacement all across America’s urban landscapes.
VF Developments promises pretty apartments at prettier prices, but they leave countless tragedies in their wake. And Fink, as the bridge between VF Developments and USC, shifts the weight of his injustices onto our shoulders as well.
Though Fink is not the face of VF Developments, his actions show that he is still involved in its operations. Using PropertyShark and California Secretary of State Business directories, we found at least 10 properties registered in his name. Moreover, Fink, as co-founder, is responsible for creating and perpetuating a predatory business model, one that destroys the affordable housing stock in communities of color. 
When one of our own is responsible for exploiting vulnerable people, they bring shame to the name of our university. We call on the Trojan Family to rally together against Fink’s exploitative practices in support of the tenants of 920 Everett. We must ensure that VF Development rescinds the 60-day eviction notices or that the management of 920 Everett falls into safe hands.
We ask the Trojan Family to sign and share our petition to demand that Fink to stop predatory evictions in Chinatown. We’re nearing 1000 supporters, but the full support of the USC community would tell Fink that he does not represent our values and aspirations.
We ask the Trojan Family to contact Fink to tell him that he cannot clothe his wrongdoings in the cardinal and gold. He must safeguard the housing of the 920 Everett tenants.
We ask the Trojan Family to contact the USC Board of Trustees and Lusk Executive Board to tell them that they must hold Fink accountable.
We must “Fight On” for the tenants of 920 Everett.
