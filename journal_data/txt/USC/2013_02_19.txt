USC’s El Centro Chicano, which provides programs and services to Latino/a students, is slated to be relocated this summer to the Student Union to better accommodate the organization and those it serves, according to a statement released by El Centro Chicano Director William N. Vela.
El Centro Chicano is currently located at the privately owned United University Church on 34th Street. Other university cultural and diversity organizations, such as the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, the Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center and the Asian Pacific American Student Services, are located in the Student Union on the second and fourth floors.

Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Denzil Suite said the relocation is in a preliminary discussion phase but is something that administrators have discussed in the past.
“We’ve been talking about ‘Why are they all the way over there?’ for years, but this time we want to really have a good discussion and examination,” Suite said.
Suite said the possible move has been suggested because it might make more sense to have El Centro Chicano closer to all the other student affairs organizations on campus.
Though he did not give a firm reason for the relocation, Suite emphasized that funding issues are not necessarily the reason for the move.
“There are absolutely no plans to cut any funding from El Centro, at all,” Suite said. “No funding cuts, no staffing reduction, nothing like that has even been mentioned.”
Suite acknowledged that though the United University Church is a “historical artifact” on campus, the recent construction of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center has created expanded the opportunities for the university’s cultural organizations to work together more closely.
“[El Centro Chicano] works with the other groups on campus to offer a wide spate of understanding of what it means to be a person of color in this ever-changing, diverse Los Angeles and world,” Suite said.
The organization was established in 1972. Suite said its goal for the past four decades has been to provide educational outreach and support to students of Latino heritage through programs that raise cultural awareness and growth.
“The organization is the cultural and programmatic arm for Chicano and Latino students,” Suite said.
The organization offers services to Latino students to learn more about their cultural heritage. There is a Latino floor residential program located in Fluor Tower for first-year students.
In addition to supporting academic programs and services such as the Latino Honor Society, El Centro Chicano works to promote awareness of Latino issues within the community. The organization offers many programs aimed at fulfilling this goal, such as the Latino Speaker Series, in which prominent Latino leaders from many professional fields speak to students in an effort to inspire and educate the next generation of Latino leaders.
Suite recognized the importance of fostering diversity through cultural centers.
“Students today don’t come for just one thing even if they are Latino,” Suite said. “[Students] want to explore other options and services available at the university.”
The center and its possible relocation provides an additional opportunity for students to connect with one another through culture and experience.
“The possibility of El Centro Chicano’s relocation is an opportunity to say we can make that happen by bringing them [the organizations] closer together,” Suite said.
After 40 years, how will this move support Chicano/Latino students? or the community?  Where is the discussion and the data supporting such a move? and more importantly, how does this fit into USC’s more long-term goals of increasing Latino enrollment and retention? ECC was started by students, & the first time ECC was moved from its OWN building (which was demolished) to ONE FLOOR,  the church was suppose to have been temporary until a better location could be found. Thirty-two years later its still there and now it is understood that the church as an independently run building, turned out to be an ideal location for student/parent/community programs.  After over 3 decades of services in it’s current location, El Centro Chicano provides a unique intellectual/cultural space that has allows for the student community to ENGAGE not just with other campus students groups and resources but with the larger community in general.  Could we say that a move to Student Union will facilitate the same functions the church has provided .  Now the university wants to move ECC to smaller offices in Student Union, less space, less opportunity, instead of RETURNING the space that was lost when El Centro was “temporarily” relocated… and for the the “given” reasons of moving the center closer to other groups? El Centro Chicano already does that and it would only hinder it’s ability to continue to do so….. these “plans” to move ECC makes me question the motives that the University has in regards to it’s commitment to Chican@/Latin@ students and community.
The fact that USC states that El Centro Chicano is “too far” from student Union and other students, is ridiculous. How is it being 3 min away from Student Union  considered to be too “far”? Its on campus, with a huge banner at the front labeled “El Centro Chicano.” It is known, trust me. Not only that, El centro Chicano already connects with all other cultural centers. Yet, relocating them wont make that difference since its already been done and will continue that way. It  has been at the University Church for 33 Years and has not failed to attend any student or limited access to only simply Latino students. It is open to everyone and has become a home, a sanctuary to all of those who benefit from its resources.Relocating El Centro is taking away its history and cornering it to a small tight room, clustering all multi-cultural centers into one tight building.  Why sweep us under the rug? In fact, I believe that all cultural centers should have their own floors! Its just USC ways of cornering its minority to one small tight spot. As a student, I refuse that USC relocates this center. Most might believe its not a big deal but trust me, it is. It affects us students in various ways who utilize the centers space for events, meetings, studying and etc. I refuse to let USC take away El Centro Chicano’s history and push its minorities into one tight corner of a space and label it the “multi-cultural Center” with one voice. 
Si Se Puede! Fight On!
To me, having El Centro at the church makes it a sanctuary, similar to the spaces of the Sanctuary movement–a dedicated and safe, protected space for community and dissent, rather than one that can be too-easily controlled, co-opted, or manipulated by the university. I would love to see it stay at its current location, not as simply out of habit, or even a nod to history (which is important), but as a statement about the present and future of our culture and our organizing. That said, I can see why some would prefer to move it. We will go on, either way, of course. Though it remains to be seen what may happen to our voice if we are put in a university owned and operated space. Well, our voice and our cojones. 
Con cariño, que viva…

Undergraduate Student Government passed a resolution Tuesday to resolve funding and communication issues between USG’s Program Board and university’s administration.
After the implementation of new security measures this January, the univeresity requires Program Board to allocate more money for security. This has resulted in higher costs for Program Board to put on events, such as the free concerts students enjoy each year. These higher security costs cut into Program Board’s budget and its ability to hire performers, according to Program Board.
Program Board Director Juan Espinoza said the costs of extra security measures hinder Program Board’s ability to put on events for students, potentially leading to a lack of student participation. Without the measure in place, funds for the additional security would come straight from the Program Board’s student programming budget.
“There should be a culture of participation at USC and things shouldn’t be shut down because we can’t afford fencing or security,” Espinoza said. “If the university wants to create these new security and fencing policies, then I think that the university should start contributing funds to that. We shouldn’t need to spend student programming funds to support these extraneous policies that the university created.”
Furthermore, Espinoza believes these new measures and a lack of university cooperation with Program Board have already directly affected Program Board’s ability to hire performers for student events.
“Sometimes, we get an opportunity where there’s a cool speaker or band who wants to come to campus in three weeks, but we can’t make that happen because the university doesn’t allow it or can’t be flexible to it,” Espinoza said. “We have to go through this huge bureaucracy that doesn’t let us do the best things for students sometimes, and that’s just not fair.”
Lamar Gary, the executive director of the Black Student Assembly, said the extra costs have already forced organizations to cancel their events because they cannot afford the cost of security.
“At the start of the semester, a Women’s Student Assembly event was canceled because it did not meet the security requirements,” Gary said. “With this resolution, events like this can happen. Each organization, including Concerts Committee, the Black Student Assembly and the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, will be able to reallocate their budget to spend more on programming expenses rather than paying for additional security.”
This new resolution encourages student input in the creation of policies that affect student programming. The resolution stipulates that the university requires a more comprehensive and flexible programming process, as well as contribute funds to Program Board to cover the costs of extra security and fencing.
The resolution was drafted by residential senators Sarah Loh and Jasmine McAllister.
Students agree that the student programming funds should be put toward putting on events for students, not toward adhering to university policies. Molly Barber, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said social events are important for creating a sense of student community.
“The university should be supporting events for students because events are great ways for students to come together,” Barber said. “I get that security for events is important, but if the costs of security are preventing events from happening, then there isn’t any point for the increased measures in the first place.”
Espinoza said he hopes that the university will respond to the resolution’s passage and help Program Board with its events.
“The resolution sends a message to the administration and I hope they listen,” Espinoza said. “If the university were to be responsive, it would help us have more funds to work on programs if they are to cover the increased security … it would also be helpful to be included in the process of policy changes because we are the most impacted by these policies, and we’re rarely taken into consideration.”

Students have elected juniors Christian Kurth and Ryan Park to serve as Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president, respectively, for the 2013-14 school year.
Kurth, the current USG director of university affairs, and Park, a Greek senator, received 2,925 votes, winning by a margin of 7.5 points. The presidential ticket of current USG Senate Speaker Pro Tempore Matthew Arkfeld and Greek Senator Alexander Cascante placed second with 2,499 votes.
Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
Kurth said that he plans to begin his term by first building a strong foundation of leaders for their team, hiring individuals who will be able to best serve USG during the coming academic year.
“Our first plan of action will be to make sure we hire the best team possible by searching out the most talented and incredible individuals this school has to offer,” Kurth said.
Park agreed, saying that he and Kurth will play a crucial role in the execution of the goals of USG.
“We’ll start by making sure that our team is the best that it can be by bringing in those individuals who are ready to take on a new year of leadership, to work with us and to make USG the best that it can be in every aspect possible,” Park said.
This year’s election brought 5,631 students to the polls, nearly a 100-ballot increase from last year’s election, in which a total of 5,546 students participated.
Current USG President Mikey Geragos said that such a large turnout is encouraging for the elections team and for USG as a whole.
“I think for having just two candidates running, we had a great turnout,” Geragos said. “The turnout speaks volumes about how well the elections recruitment team did. We’re excited that people cared and were actually interested in voting. That’s obviously a big boost for this organization.”
Park said he is looking forward to working with and learning from Geragos and current USG Vice President Vinnie Prasad through the end of this year and into his term as vice president for the 2013-14 academic year.
“Although we are going to spend the rest of this year serving out our terms, I think that a large majority of that will be transitioning and learning from the current president and vice president, and making sure we can do everything that we can to be prepared for once we do set in officially and take over the reins,” Park said.
USG also announced the election of 12 new senators. No incumbents ran for re-election.
Sophomore Nicole Schrad, freshman Logan Heley and junior Jamie Dick were elected to serve as Greek senators.
Heley said that as a Greek senator he hopes to bridge relations between the Greek community and other student populations.
“My first goal is to make sure that the relationship between the Greek community and the rest of the university continues to be a positive one,” Heley said. “I’m hoping to help the Greek community connect with the rest of the students at the university.”
The six winners of the residential senator election were freshmen David Choi, Michael Nguyen and Samantha Cheng and sophomores Matthew Prusak, Brandon Chang and Brianna McRee.
Juniors Brett Ressler, Matthew Leiv and Lorin Winata were elected to serve as commuter senators.
Kurth said that now the election has concluded, he can begin focusing on his next leadership role within USG.
“I’m most looking forward to another year with this amazing organization. This will be my fourth year, and I couldn’t be more excited to begin leading it,” Kurth said.

A wrongful death lawsuit, filed  against the university by the parents of two USC graduate students who were shot off campus last year, was dropped Friday by a Los Angeles judge. The lawsuit was filed in May.
The parents filed the suit seeking unspecified damages and claiming that USC misled them into believing that the school was one of the safest in the nation. USC gave their sympathies but said the case was baseless, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Superior Court Judge Michael Johnson dismissed the case by citing insufficient legal arguments.
Alan Burton Newman, the attorney for the parents of Qu and Wu, said he plans to appeal the decision, claiming that if it were not for the misrepresentations, the engineer students would have studied elsewhere.
Ming Qu and Ying Wu, 23-year-old electronic engineering students, were shot and killed off-campus April 11, 2012 while sitting in Qu’s BMW around 1 a.m. They were near the intersection of 27th Street and Raymond Avenue.
According to the Los Angeles Police Department, the two were found dead after an apparent robbery that turned deadly; Wu was found in the passenger seat and Qu stumbled to a nearby residence.
Wanzhi Qu and Xiahong Fei, Qu’s parents, and Xuyong Wu and Meinan Yin, Wu’s parents, argued that the university is responsible for areas beyond the campus. The suit alleged that USC “provided no patrolling” in the neighborhood where the shooting occurred and persisted with a “clearly misleading” portrayal of safety after the incident.
But the parents did not have evidence of the university’s responsibility for off-campus crimes committed by people not affiliated with USC. The judge said that even if USC misrepresented the safety of the surrounding area, these misrepresentations did not directly lead to the shooting.
The lawsuit alleged that USC claimed on its website to be “ranked among the safest of U.S. universities and colleges, with one of the most comprehensive, proactive campus and community safety programs in the nation.” The suit also stated that USC provides 24-hour security on campus and in the surrounding area.
USC attorney Debra Wong Yang told the Times the university security can only stretch so far. She said the incident occurred in the third tier of security, where officers respond to incidents but do not patrol.
The neighborhood where the incident occurred ranks 27th out of 209 L.A. neighborhoods for violent crime, according to a Times analysis of crime data.
Bryan Barnes and Javier Boldon, both 20-years-old and from South Los Angeles, were charged with the killings and robbery.
Yang could not be reached for statement.

USC alumnus Gerald “Jerry” Buss, chairman and majority owner of the Los Angeles Lakers, died Monday morning from kidney failure. He was 80.
The legendary owner had been hospitalized with an undisclosed form of cancer in the past 18 months, according to a statement released by the Lakers.
Buss was born on Jan. 28, 1933 in Salt Lake City, Utah, and was raised in a coal-mining town in Wyoming during the Great Depression.
Buss received a Master of Science and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from USC in 1957 after graduating from the University of Wyoming with a Bachelor in Science in chemistry. After graduating from USC, he worked in aerospace technology for Douglas Aircraft in California and made real estate investments during the Los Angeles real estate boom, according to the New York Times.
Buss served as a professor and was an inaugural member of the USC College Board of Councilors.
Though Buss left the university to work in the business and sports world, he conducted philanthropic work at USC. In January 2008, Buss donated $7.5 million to the chemistry department in the USC College, which is now the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, in order to expand and support chemistry education and research at the university.
The donation funded two endowed chairs in the chemistry department, which were named after his USC mentors Sidney Benson and David Dows. The endowment also created a scholarship directed at chemistry graduate students.
In 1974 Buss became a founding owner of the Los Angeles Strings, a team within the World Team Tennis league. Buss bought the Lakers, the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and The Great Western Forum, along with some other real estate, in 1979 for $67.5 million, making it the largest transaction in sports history at the time.
Buss also operated the Los Angeles Sparks, a WNBA team. In 1999, he moved the three professional sports teams to their current location at the Staples Center. He sold The Forum in the same year.
Under Buss, the Lakers won 10 NBA championships from 1980 to 2010. Buss was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. Forbes valued the Lakers at $1 billion in January, making it the second-most profitable team in the NBA.
Ownership of the Lakers will remain with the Buss family, according to a statement from the Lakers. Funeral and memorial service arrangements are pending.

They why have you removed so many comments?   Who are you protecting?
As the DT is now limiting free speech I suggest we take over this article to continue the discussion.
I ask the following:
1) Is Melissa the real racist?
2) Is Phi Kap even worth discussing as part of the Greek system at SC?
3) Why is the DT trying to limit the free discussion of this topic?
Unfortunately, an error in the WordPress moderation of the comments led to 110 comments being switched into the “Pending approval” category instead of the “Approved” category, where they were originally. There was no purposeful comment takedown — apologies for the inconvenience.

USC men’s baseball started a new era this weekend under interim head coach Dan Hubbs, and until the bottom of the ninth in the third game of the opening series, the Trojans were off to a rough start.
Strong start · In his college debut, freshman pitcher Kyle Twomey gave up three earned runs in 6.1 innings with four strikeouts and just one walk. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
USC (1-2) faced three different teams in their opening weekend series, losing two games on the road against Cal State Fullerton and Bakersfield.
But the Trojans returned to Dedeaux Field to face Nebraska (0-4) in what began as an old-fashioned pitcher’s duel and ended in a thrilling 4-3 walk-off victory in USC’s home opener on Sunday afternoon.
“Sunday is that day where you either sweep the series, win the series or salvage the series,” Hubbs said. “I thought we did a great job of salvaging the weekend.”
Freshman pitcher Kyle Twomey took the mound for the Trojans in his first collegiate start and held his own in a game dominated early by starting pitching. USC took an early 1-0 lead in the second inning that lasted until the sixth, when Twomey surrendered three runs in his only rocky inning of the day.
As it did for most of the opening series, the Trojan offense looked like it was about to come up short. The team was unable to score in consecutive innings with runners in scoring position and frequently fell victim to elusive timely hitting.
In the bottom of the ninth, trailing the Huskers 3-2, the Trojans pieced together its best, and most clutch, offensive effort of the game. Freshman right fielder Vahn Bozoian and junior third baseman Kevin Swick tacked together a pair of hits, forcing Nebraska to intentionally walk the bases loaded. Sophomore catcher Garrett Stubbs tied the game with a sacrifice fly.
The team is no stranger to walk-offs and senior infielder Adam Landecker said he was confident stepping up to the plate in a high-pressure situation.
“When we came in for the bottom of the ninth, we knew we were going to win,” Landecker said.
He sent the team home with a two-out walk-off single and helped the team notch its first victory.
The win over Nebraska had added importance following the two tough losses that preceded it. On Saturday, Bakersfield took advantage of an inconsistent and inexperienced pitching staff and topped the Trojans, 9-4.
Three of the five Trojan pitchers stepped into new positions Saturday: Sophomore right-hander Wyatt Strahan made his first career start and freshmen right-handers Shane Gonzalez and Kyle Davis both made their collegiate debuts for the Trojans. USC sent five pitchers to the mound and the staff collectively allowed eight hits and walked 10 batters.
Offensively, the team struggled with plate discipline, striking out 11 times and walking only once.
The poor showing against Bakersfield followed a strong effort in the team’s season-opening loss to  No. 22 Cal State Fullerton, in which the Trojans again struggled to muster any consistent hitting.
The Titans kept the Trojan bats quiet for all but two innings, starting off the game with 4.2 hitless innings and closing the game with three more. USC only reached base in the fifth and sixth innings, with its first base runner coming off a two-out single by Swick to break up a no-hitter in the fifth inning. USC’s only runs came off the bat of junior shortstop James Roberts, who launched a two-run home run to left field with two outs in the sixth inning.
Junior left-hander Bob Wheatley, who pitched four scoreless innings after surrendering a run in the first frame, gave up two go-ahead runs in the bottom of the sixth.
Friday’s loss marks the first time in five seasons that the Trojans have dropped an opening game.
Hubbs said Sunday that he’s focused on working with his young team and building confidence in his players, and freshmen such as Twomey are hoping to improve enough to keep the team’s momentum going.
“I hope I can continue to just go out and get good starts,” Twomey said. “As long as I can give us a chance to win every time, I’ll be content.”
A win against Loyola Marymount today would even their 1-2 record and give them a chance to bounce back.
“If we can hold our heads just above water until we really get in our groove, I think we’ll be in good shape,” Hubbs said.
USC was scheduled to play Loyola Marymount on Tuesday night, but the game was postponed because of impending rain and will be played this evening at Dedeaux Field at 6:00 p.m.
Freshman pitcher Brent Wheatley, brother of Friday night starter Bobby Wheatley, will start on the mound for the Trojans in his collegiate debut.

On Monday, Los Angeles Lakers owner and USC alumnus Jerry Buss passed away at the age of 80. Buss had owned the team since 1979, winning 10 championships at the helm of one of the NBA’s most profitable and successful franchises.
Buss’ legacy has been covered extensively since his death — he reinvigorated the Lakers, giving them an identity as a basketball powerhouse over the last three decades. He oversaw the careers of legends  such as Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O’Neal and, most recently, Kobe Bryant. And along the way, he established himself as quite the provocateur, frequenting The Forum and later the Staples Center with female companions often a third of his age.
It would be easy for me to sing Buss’ praises as others have done, to list off his accomplishments and give him credit as perhaps the best owner in professional basketball. But that wouldn’t really be a fair bit of analysis. In fact, it would mostly be lazy.
I’m not a Lakers fan. I don’t dislike the franchise — I just have no real ties to Los Angeles (instead, I’m a proud supporter of the hapless Washington Wizards). I love the NBA and watch it more than any other sports league, but I’d be lying to myself if I pretended to truly understand the impact Buss had on the Lakers since he took the reins.
What I do know is this: Buss helped shaped my, and countless other college-aged basketball fans’, views of the NBA.
What does that mean, exactly? Buss helped establish a trend of super teams in the NBA — franchises that are consistently competitive and turning a profit. The Lakers were obviously one of the better squads in the league before Buss, winning five championships between 1949 and 1954 (albeit in Minneapolis) and another title in 1972. They were not, however, a powerhouse by any stretch of the imagination. Buss changed that.
The Lakers quickly joined the Boston Celtics as the NBA’s marquee teams in the ’80s. Their “Showtime” offense revolutionized the game and brought in huge ratings for a lagging league that was reinvigorated by the rivalry between Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. The team enjoyed an incredibly productive stretch of five championships in a single decade, which was quite the accomplishment in an increasingly competitive landscape of opponents.
The ’90s were dominated by another super team — Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls — but the dawn of the new millennium brought forth another run for Los Angeles’ premier sports team. The early 2000s were also when most early-’90s babies, myself included, started showing a vested interest in the NBA.
In fact, some of my earliest memories of the NBA stem back to 2001, when the Lakers took down Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the Finals. Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant were an unbeatable duo surrounded by a group of knockdown shooters. The 76ers were easy to root for as the underdogs led by the undersized Iverson, but Los Angeles’ pure dominance was impossible to dismiss.
That 4-1 shellacking of the 76ers sold me on the Lakers. They were clearly the cream of the crop in the NBA, and though my knowledge of the game has increased from a third grader’s level since then, that viewpoint hasn’t changed. I may not root for them, but I certainly expect the Lakers to be a title contender on a year-to-year basis. Some have made the connection between L.A.’s struggles this year and Buss’ declining health. Seems like quite a stretch to me, but it’s not a stretch to say that everyone in the Lakers organization had immense respect for the owner.
Here’s the bottom line — Jerry Buss single-handedly helped make the NBA what it is today. Professional basketball would have a completely different outlook without the Lakers as the biggest draw in the sport.
Clearly, Buss didn’t control the destinies of his star players, and quite a bit of luck and timing was involved in attaining the sheer amount of Hall of Fame talent the Lakers have taken in. But that doesn’t change the fact that Buss led the way in transforming the organization into the biggest sports draw in the second-biggest media market in America.
For better or worse, the Lakers are the Dallas Cowboys and New York Yankees of professional basketball, and the team continues to serve that role for the foreseeable future thanks to its legendary owner.

In a game of runs, the Trojans tripped during the final sprint.
After outplaying Cal nearly the entire game, USC blew a 10 point lead in the final six minutes, losing 76-68 to the Golden Bears in Berkeley after being outscored 25-7 to finish the game. The Trojans actually held a 15-point lead in the second half, but could only muster two field goals after taking a 10 point lead with 5:52 left.
“I think we played really well to that point,” said USC interim head coach Bob Cantu. “At the end, we weren’t able to get stops and we had some key turnovers that led to some run-outs for them.”
Moving on · Senior guard Jio Fontan, who scored 16 points in the loss at Cal, looks to get the team refocused for Sunday’s game against UCLA. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
Junior shooting guard J.T. Terrell led the Trojans with 17 points, while sophomore guard Byron Wesley had 16 points, including a season-high four 3-point shots on six attempts. Senior point guard Jio Fontan also had 16 points to go along with five assists.
After the Trojans took their 61-51 lead with just under six minutes to go, Cal went on an 11-0 run over the next 2:40. The run was Cal’s third run of at least nine straight points, and was fueled by a 3-pointer each from leading guards Allen Crabbe and Justin Cobbs, who combined for 45 points.
Down 62-61, the Trojans resolutely ended the run on the next possession with a spot-on 3-pointer from Fontan to go back up 64-62 with 3:25 to go. Instead of the momentum turning back to USC, though, the Golden Bears went on another run, this time a 10-0 sprint to give them a 72-64 advantage with 34 seconds left.
The sides traded points for the next four possessions, but after Fontan missed a 3-pointer with USC down 76-68 with 16 seconds left, the Trojan comeback effort was officially finished.
Finishing with a game-high 23 points and 10 rebounds, Crabbe found his stroke late and outscored USC himself, 10-7, to finish the game.
“He made big shot after big shot,” Cantu said on Crabbe. “He played tremendously and those shots were able to catapult [Cal] over the hump late.”
The agonizing part of the loss for USC was that the Trojans had the game in hand for the first 34 minutes.
After Cal found a jumper for a quick two on their first possession, USC reeled off a 9-0 run, capitalized by a signature Terrell 3-pointer. The Trojans then missed their next eight shots and Cal had a 13-0 stretch to retake the lead at 15-9 with 11:15 to go in the half.
The scoring streaks weren’t done yet though. USC had a 12-0 run in them this time, capped off by junior forward Dewayne Dedmon nailing an off-balance jumper while being fouled; he made a free throw for the three-point play. USC led 21-15 at this point, and the sides traded baskets for the rest of the half as USC entered the break leading 32-28. Cal had nine turnovers in the opening 20 minutes, and USC had 16 points off of those Golden Bear miscues.
Just like the first half, Cal scored with a jumper on the first possession of the second half. And, just like the first half, USC went on another run. This time, the Trojans made their first six shots of the half for a 15-2 spurt that gave them a 47-32 with 16:01 left in the game.
Cal pulled off a 9-0 stretch of their own to cut it back to 10 as the Trojans kept turning the ball over. But USC was still hot from the floor, and shot 58 percent through the first 14 minutes of the second half. Unfortunately, the last six minutes were the ones that mattered most.
In earning the weekend split, one of USC’s bright spots was the stellar play of Dedmon, who logged a season-high 32 minutes on Sunday, while junior center Omar Oraby played only four. Oraby totaled just seven minutes against Cal and Stanford, in part because of Dedmon’s growth.
“Dewayne has done a great job of not getting in foul trouble these last few games,” Cantu said. “And we’ve also been going small lately, and [senior forward] Aaron Fuller is getting a lot more time because of this.”
Dedmon played 31 minutes against Stanford on Thursday, his previous season high.
USC’s next game is on Sunday when it plays rival UCLA at the Galen Center. Tipoff is scheduled for 12:30 p.m.

After a weeklong break following a 2-1 showing at the ITA National Team Indoor championships in Charlottesville, Va., the USC women’s tennis team will return to action today with a home matchup against San Diego State at 1:30 p.m.
The Trojans are undefeated this year at Marks Stadium and will look to continue that home winning streak against the visiting Aztecs, who hold a respectable 3-2 record on the season but have yet to play away from home.
Following a weekend in which the Women of Troy played matches against three ranked teams, there is an understandable concern that the squad would look past an unranked San Diego State team, especially with a rematch against the No. 7-ranked Cal Golden Bears on the horizon.
USC head coach Richard Gallien, however, did not think that overlooking an opponent would be any cause for concern among his players.
“Certainly we talked about that and we’ll find out,” Gallien said. “More than anything, with a week and a half off, we’re tired of practicing with each other and ready to go compete against someone else.”
Following their first loss of the year in the quarterfinals of the ITA’s against No. 8 North Carolina, the Women of Troy dropped from No. 4 to No. 6 nationally. However, the USC was impressive enough two weekends ago that three members of the team rank in the top five nationally.
Senior Danielle Lao jumped from No. 14 to No. 3 overall (in addition to winning Pac-12 player of the week, the third Trojan to do so this year). Meanwhile, sophomore Sabrina Santamaria found herself ranked No. 1 in singles and doubles play. She and her doubles partner, junior Kaitlyn Christian, are undefeated on the year. Santamaria and Lao enter the matchup against the Aztecs with the highest singles rankings in either of their USC careers.
Santamaria’s accomplishments are especially impressive and, rather than attempting to keep the sophomore away from her press clippings, Gallien decided to let her enjoy the accomplishment a bit by showing off the rankings in his office. He insisted that he was not concerned about the possibility that the adulation would distract her.
“We decided to have fun with it. It’s pretty cool to say you were No. 1 in the nation in something,” Gallien said. “I would be more worried if Sabrina wasn’t such a grounded kid, but she is.”
USC will look at this matchup as a tough test before beginning Pac-12 conference play this weekend with a rematch against Cal. The Trojans won the first matchup against the Golden Bears in Charlottesville in dominating fashion, 4-1, but the Pac-12 conference is notorious for being a daunting exercise with top-notch competition every few days.
Gallien himself believes that four teams in the Pac-12, including USC, are among the top six in the nation when healthy. Defending their conference title will be tough, but the Women of Troy are certainly up to the challenge.
Following the match against Cal, the Women of Troy play twice more on the road — against San Diego on March 1 and UCLA on March 8.

The No. 2 USC men’s tennis team suffered its first loss of the season this weekend, falling to No. 1 Virginia in the finals of the ITA National Team Indoor championships in Seattle, Wash.
Setting the pace ·Sophomore Yannick Hanfmann was named the Pac-12 player of the week thanks to his efforts at the ITA National Indoors. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The Trojans defeated several ranked opponents, including crosstown rival UCLA, to reach the championship match, but eventually lost 4-2 to the Cavaliers, who were hungry for revenge after losing to the Trojans in last year’s national championship.
In the first round of the tournament, the Trojans swept the No. 15 Texas A&M Aggies 4-0. The next day, the Trojans took down the No. 7 Kentucky Wildcats 4-1 in the quarterfinals. The win against Kentucky set up a semifinal battle between USC and UCLA, ranked just behind the Trojans at No. 3 in the nation.
USC opened up the match by dropping the doubles point for the first time all season. After UCLA’s No. 2 duo defeated sophomore Roberto Quiroz and freshman Max de Vroome 8-3, USC’s No. 3 pair, junior Emilio Gomez and sophomore Eric Johnson, who are ranked No. 49, evened the score with an 8-4 win over their opponents. The Trojans lost the doubles point when junior Ray Sarmiento and sophomore Yannick Hanfmann, ranked No. 48, fell to UCLA’s No. 1 pair 8-4.
USC faced a unique challenge in playing from behind for the first time this season, but some hotly contested wins in singles helped the team secure a dramatic 4-3 victory over the Bruins. Hanfmann, ranked No. 94 in the country, was the only Trojan to win in straight sets, upsetting his opponent, No. 55 Dennis Mkrtchian, 6-4, 6-2 to even the score at 1-1. The five remaining singles matches all went to three sets.
The Bruins regained the lead when Dennis Novikov, ranked No. 58 nationally, upset No. 12 Sarmiento 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. To tie the score up again, No. 46 Johnson defeated Karue Sell 1-6, 7-5, 6-4. Then, No. 10 Gomez beat Marcos Giron, ranked No. 13 nationally, 2-6, 7-5, 6-2 to put USC ahead again. To keep things close, UCLA’s Clay Thompson upset   No. 109 de Vroome 2-6, 6-4, 6-4.
With the score tied at 3-3, the fate of the match lay in the hands of No. 23 Quiroz. After dropping the first set to Adrien Puget, who is ranked No. 42 nationally, Quiroz came back and won the second set to force a third, which went to a tiebreaker. To the delight of his teammates, Quiroz emerged victorious by a score of 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4) to put USC through to the finals of the tournament.
“Any time a player can be in that moment and be successful in that moment, it’s great for them to draw upon,” USC head coach Peter Smith said. “[Quiroz] is a very talented kid and he’s coming of age.”
After winning three matches in three days, USC faced No. 1 Virginia in the finals of the tournament. For the second match in a row and only the second time all season, the Trojans fell behind when they conceded the doubles point to the Cavaliers. Virginia’s No. 15 doubles team of Justin Shane and Ian Uriguen defeated de Vroome and Quiroz 8-3. Then, Gomez and Johnson fell 8-4 to another pair from Virginia, suspending play at the No. 3 spot, where Sarmiento and Hanfmann were about to pull off an upset against a pair from Virginia that was ranked No. 4 nationally.
This time, the Trojans were unable to come back from their early deficit and ended up falling by a 4-2 score. To open up singles play, Gomez fell to the top-ranked player in the nation, Alex Domijan, 6-3, 6-2. Then, Johnson gave the Trojans their first point of the day with a 7-5, 6-4 victory over Justin Shane.
Virginia responded by extending its lead when No. 7 Jarmere Jenkins handed Sarmiento his third loss in as many days by a score of 6-2, 6-4. De Vroome was able to overcome No. 25 Ryan Shane, 7-6 (4), 6-3, but the Cavaliers secured their victory soon after, with Mitchell Frank pulling off the upset over Quiroz, 6-3, 7-5.
“Virginia outplayed us,” Smith said. “They were just a better team today.”
Despite the loss, Smith remained optimistic. After all, the Trojans didn’t go undefeated last season either, and they still ended up winning the national championship. Smith merely sees this as an early test for his team.
“To me, this is all just studying for the final,” Smith said. “We have finals in May … and we didn’t do so well on one of the tests.”
The Trojans look to bounce back from their first loss in a home match against UCLA on Friday at 3 p.m.

Entering Monday’s showdown with crosstown rival UCLA, the USC men’s volleyball team was hoping to put its past woes behind it. Instead, the night proved only to add to the team’s frustration. This match, which marked the Trojan’s third in five days, would leave the Trojans in disappointment once again as the Bruins overpowered them, 25-18, 25-21, 25-17.
Not enough · Sophomore middle blocker Robert Feathers (16) had four kills in USC’s defeat at the hands of No. 2 UCLA on Monday. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
USC (3-7) entered Monday night’s game coming off a tough contest against top-ranked BYU on Saturday night. The Trojans were upended by the Cougars (9-3) in four sets, unable to capitalize on the momentum of their victory over Cal Baptist on Thursday. Though disappointing, the match featured impressive performances from junior opposite Tanner Jansen and sophomore setter Micah Christenson. The production of these two helped USC stay competitive against a tough BYU squad.
UCLA (10-8), led by junior outside hitter Gonzalo Quiroga, proved to be another difficult challenge for the Trojans. Owners of the fifth-best hitting percentage in the nation, the Bruins took advantage of some strong attacks, as well as some Trojan errors, to jump to an early 7-2 lead. Though the Trojans were able to settle down, the strong blocking from UCLA made it nearly impossible to chip away at the lead. The Bruins took the first set easily, 25-18.
UCLA jumped out to a quick lead once again in the second set, thanks largely to the many service errors made by the Trojans. But this time, USC was able to bounce back and, thanks to some key kills from Jansen, evened the game at 15. From there, the two teams traded points until UCLA pulled away once again. With two powerful kills at the end, the Bruins took the set, 25-21.
Neither team was able to gain an early advantage in the third set. Though the Bruins’ strong attack won them a number of points, the Trojans earned many back from UCLA’s serving mistakes. Eventually, the clutch play of Quiroga allowed the Bruins to pull ahead 12-7. The Trojans did their best not to fall behind but, as was the story of the night, they were unable to close in on their cross-town rivals. UCLA finished off the set 25-17 and took the match.
“The serving and passing is what made the difference,“ USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “We couldn’t get them into trouble. Our players that usually put guys in trouble at the service line didn’t have any success doing that and their offense was in rhythm all night.”
Though the Trojans hit a respectable .338 in this match, their poor serving would be their undoing. Christenson, who has had six aces in each of the previous two matches, was not nearly as effective against the Bruins, and the rest of the team combined for 12 service errors.
However, USC still had reason to celebrate Monday night, as they saw the return of junior All-American libero Henry Cassiday. Cassiday, who was sidelined as a result of his off-season hip surgery, got his first action of the season on Monday night, marking the Trojan’s return to full strength.
“Henry wasn’t his best, but it was great to have him out there,” Ferguson said. “It was good to have his experience and level of understanding, that helped settle us down quite a bit.”
The Trojans dropped to 3-7 with the loss and finish off their homestand with a match against UC Santa Barbara at the Galen Center on Thursday at 7 p.m.
Agreed completely…like Lane Kiffin…our men’s volleyball coach needs to be fired
A completely pathetic showing by the Trojans. Coach Ferguson showed his complete lack of skills which
should be rewarded by another Haden firing. Why would Cassiday come back this late in the season to
use up his junior year when his presence will not produce any significant changes in the end result? Serving
was the absolute worst. Please ask the Coach the reason that no out of conference matches were scheduled
this season while the ‘ruins had six. The game experience could only help this young team to find out who
really belongs on the court.

Resembling a giant metallic saltshaker, a dalek, the most infamous villain on the hit science-fiction television show Doctor Who, rolled slowly across the red carpet floor on the Marriott Los Angeles Ballroom on Saturday. As the contraption made its way through the crowd, it shouted in an unmistakable, synthesized voice:“Exterminate! Exterminate!”
Family affair · Baba Bueller (right) purchased the last two tickets to the convention as a Christmas present for his daughter, Lauren Hirsch (left). Bueller began watching the show in high school because he enjoyed the writing. – Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan
It continued to shout until it backed into a registration table, causing the table to jerk and the officials sitting behind it to become trapped.
If this were the TV show, the dalek would have then aimed one of its arms (which resembles a kitchen whisk) at the three people trapped behind the table and vaporized them. Instead, the dalek did something out of character: It apologized.
“Sorry! Sorry!” said the dalek in the same robotic voice, as it backed away from the table. “I didn’t realize I had gotten so close!”
As the dalek continued to stutter apologies, fans watching the scene at the 24 Hours of Gallifrey One Convention immediately stopped what they were doing and moved to help the officials get the table back into place. (As one member of the crowd noted, “Only here will you hear a dalek apologize.”)
The moment provided a glimpse of insight into what Gallifrey One, the annual Doctor Who convention held in Los Angeles from Friday to Sunday, is all about. The convention, now in its 24th year, offers panels, interviews, Q&As, a dealer and art show and a masquerade ball for those who dress up for the event. More than that though, the convention fosters a camaraderie among attendees, who gather to Gallifrey One to share in their love of Doctor Who.
Establishing that friendly environment can easily be traced back to the philosophy of the founders of the convention. Led by Shaun Lyon and Robbie Bourget, the founders are friends who met through a local Doctor Who fan club back when the British science-fiction show enjoyed a small, cult-like following in the United States, said Guest Relations Director Bill Watson, who has been involved with Gallifrey One since its first year.
“We sort of adopted each other as the strays of the science fiction world,” Watson said.
The show has gotten a considerably larger audience since its reboot in 2005 and the convention has now become a destination for fans. Watson still makes a point to walk the floor and ask people how they are doing.
“We try to go around to people and ask if they’re having a good time because, when I used to attend other conventions, you didn’t know who the people running the convention were and it didn’t seem like they cared,” Watson said. “We care.”
This was apparent to attendees Gemma Ramsbottom, 26, and Kate Taylor, 24 who have been frequenting conventions for some time. The friends, who flew out from Kansas to attend Gallifrey, said the openness of the convention surprised them.
“I like the atmosphere a lot more than anime convention[s]; there are a lot more friendly people here,” said Taylor, who dressed as a Cyberman (another classic Who villain). “There’s a lot of elitism in some communities and I haven’t encountered that here.”
Ramsbottom, who was wearing a Lolita-ized Rory Williams costume (a companion to the current Doctor) that she designed herself, nodded.
“Everyone just seems to be nicer,” she said.
Doctor Who, which holds the title of the longest running science-fiction show ever, was first created by the BBC in 1963. The longevity of the show is thanks to its premise, which hinges on the fact that the main character, a time-traveling alien called the Doctor, does not die but rather regenerates, allowing the show to replace the Doctor with different actors over time.
As the show’s popularity has grown, Gallifrey One has actively fought to maintain its close-knit environment. For many years, attendance at the convention ranged from 300 to 750 guests, reflecting the small-but-dedicated American viewership of the show. After the series rebooted in 2005 and the show found a new home and advertising budget after switching from the SciFi Channel to BBC America, the show’s viewership in the United States jumped and attendance at Gallifrey has surged. Faced with a guest list of more than 3,000 people, the team made the decision to cap the convention’s attendance for the first time this year, to preserve the welcoming environment that guests have come to expect.
Though it meant that not everyone could come, the decision seemed to be the right one as the 3,600 attendees fit snugly into the Marriott’s large convention room. They were there to hear the main panel discussions during the weekend, which included speakers such as Freema Agyeman, who played companion Martha Jones in the new series’ third season in 2007, and Sylvester McCoy, who played the seventh doctor in 1987-89.
“Eventually, it gets so large you don’t want to ruin it,” Watson said. “Look what happened to San Diego Comic-Con: The first time I went in ’76 it was all one hotel — now it’s like 120,000 people and you stand in line all day. We didn’t want that. We didn’t want it to just be about standing in line and waiting to see things. This way it’s still small enough that the fans and actors can interact.”
For those unfamiliar with the Doctor Who universe, it might seem strange that so many adults make such a big deal out of attending a convention centered on a children’s show. But people like Brad Trechak, who flew from New York to attend the convention in honor of his 42nd birthday, say that the show includes elements that anyone can draw inspiration from.
“It’s one of the few shows on television which could literally go on forever. [The Doctor] can go anywhere in time and space, he can be anyone, he can do anything, so that, in itself contributes to its longevity. Pretty much anybody can relate to him because he can be everyone and he can do anything,” Trechak said. “I started watching in the ’80s and I thought it was such a marvelous concept: It’s a man who travels alone in time and space and just tries to do good. To me, it’s a universal concept that can describe anyone who’s ever felt lonely.”
This year, the series is celebrating its 50th anniversary. Many long-time fans at the convention reflected on the path that the show has traveled since its first episode aired in the ’60s.
In honor of the occasion, Cassandra Deviny, 55, from Concord, Calif., wore a shirt to the convention that read: “You never forget your first doctor.” Deviny instantly cited Jon Pertwee when asked, referring to the actor who played the third reincarnation of the Doctor from 1970-74. Deviny attended the conference with her guide dog Wiggles, who was dressed as K-9, the Doctor’s robotic animal companion. She said she has been a fan of Doctor Who for more than 30 years.
“The BBC has grown quite a bit, where with the old monsters we used to joke it was the ‘duct tape monster of the week’ and the show was always shot in one or two of the quarries in England; we knew what was going to happen or we were waiting for one of the costumes to fall apart,” Deviny said. “Now the BBC has put a lot of money in it and there’s great special effects. It’s a lot of fun.”
Despite the improved production value and expansion of the fan base, what hasn’t changed about the Doctor Who franchise is its themes of family and friendship. Baba Bueller, 40, used to watch the show with his dad; he now watches it with his daughter Lauren Hirsch, 13. The father-daughter pair flew in from Austin, Texas, to attend the convention wearing matching scarves, a trademark of the fourth Doctor. Bueller agreed that the heart of the show is what makes it resonate with so many and why he believes Gallifrey One is such a successful convention.
“The people who come to these things are really friendly, really nice,” Bueller said. “People forget about everything and have fun enjoying something when they come here. It’s totally make-believe and I think we need more of that.”
 
Gallifrey One will be back in 2014 to celebrate its 25th anniversary. Presale tickets will be available online at http://www.gallifreyone.com.

The genre of punk has long been sliced and diced into various subgenres, and nowadays it seems that just about every slightly hardcore indie band seems to slap the “post-punk” or “prog-punk” label onto itself. In the 1970s, the meaning of punk was clear as hair gel — no one was confused about the dude with the three-foot-tall mohawk or the music that he was into.
The 1980s saw various genres come out of punk, such as post-punk and thrash, but the definition of pure “punk” still held some clout. In the 1990s, the rise of pop-punk began the deviation from the roots of the genre, and the 21st century has seen just about every genre of music contain “punk” somewhere in its description.
Whether this is good or bad is a conversation for another column, but this week’s edition of New Noise looks at four different bands with new releases that all fall under the “punk” category, even though there are distinct musical differences between them all. From the retro influences of the Swingin’ Utters to the post-thrash of Big Dick, punk seems to have become a master of disguise that musicbombs (the musical equivalent of a photobomb) as many bands as it can, similar to your drunk friend who can’t help popping up looking half-dead in every picture from your night out. Oh, punk — what are we going to do with you?
Big Dick: big dick
Named after a song by the legendary Victoria punk band NoMeansNo, Big Dick is a post-punk duo based out of Ottawa, Canada. The Dirt Cult labelers released their self-titled debut last week and the result is a melange of the hardest, thrashiest, loudest, most wonderful music that you can imagine.
The band is just drums and a heavy, distorted bass, and each song on the LP grabs you by the ear and demands your attention. Big Dick wants you to headbang until you’ve rocked yourself out into a coma, and with gems such as “Wolves,” “School Yard Violence” and “Colours,” it would be best to keep your doctor on speed dial. The frantic frenzy of the LP is a perfect embodiment of the post-punk sound, and fans of bands such as NoMeansNo, the Melvins, Big Black, The Jesus Lizard and Death From Above 1979 are sure to get their kicks from Big Dick.
The Thermals: “Born To Kill”
Portland, Ore., is one of those cities that surprises you with how vivid it actually is, at least music scene-wise. Just like Minneapolis, Portland has a mind-blowing underground scene with some of the best bands getting churned out constantly.
The Thermals is one of the greats from PDX, made up of Westin Glass, Hutch Harris and Kathy Foster, the latter two notable for their folk project Hutch and Kathy.
The Thermals’ “Born To Kill” finds the band going back to its lo-fi, basic punk rock style: short, sweet and to the (very blatant) point. The anthemic “Born To Kill” serves as a sing-at-the-top-of-your-lungs song that brings back memories of the vintage British punk anthems of Stiff Little Fingers and The Business. Harris’ distinct vocals add to the charm of the song and build up much anticipation for the band’s next release, Desperate Ground, which is due out in April.
Fake Problems: “Small Devil Song”
Naples, Fla., three-piece Fake Problems is one of those bands that has had a number of genres describe their musical style, one of them being punk.
If Fake Problems is punk, it’s surely not the classical definition of punk, but the various musical styles that have influenced the band work for it and result in a unique sound that is further inimitable thanks to the unique vocals of lead singer Chris Farren.
“Small Devil Song” is off of their Florida Doesn’t Suck split album with You Blew It!, and the song is like a punkish version of the Rolling Stones’ “Sympathy for the Devil,” at least lyrics-wise. Farren sings from the POV of a “small devil” and the yearning melody works well with the sarcastic tone of the words. The beginning of the song and the subsequent verses have a staccato, playful feel to them, and the chorus begs to be sung along to. The band is unique in that its arrangement and instrumentation differs from the usual indie-punk acts of late, and fans of The Sainte Catherines and The Menzingers are sure to dig having some Fake Problems.
Swingin’ Utters: Poorly Formed
After hearing “Stuck In A Circle” and “Brains” from Singin’ Utters upcoming album, it is clear that the S.F.-based band is making a left turn from its usual punk-rock route. The band’s eighth studio album is a collection of more radio-friendly songs, yet somehow the band manages to keep its authentic feel and doesn’t conjure up disgruntled feelings of “They sold out!”
Songs such as “Brains,” “In A Video” and the title track employ a frantic guitar against a simple melody that suggests influences from bands such as The Velvet Underground, Television and The Cure (or, for all you young’uns, The Strokes). “I’m A Little Bit Country” stands out just for being a parody of a country song with the hilarious opening line of “I’m a little bit country / And a little bit of an asshole,” while “Greener Grass” has a … violin?!
The whole album is catchy and melodic, but even with the perfectly pitched package that the songs come in, when you unwrap it all, the punk sentiments that always defined the Utters are still there. There is not one bad song on Poorly Formed, and the album serves as an example of risks gone right. Twenty-six years later, these Utters are still Swingin’, and news doesn’t get much better than that.

When a spontaneous round of golf proved to be the turning point in his career as an entrepreneur, Ryan Ozonian thought nothing could get better.
Then, an email changed his life again: The Class of 2009 USC alumnus had come across the blog of billionaire entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, and after seeing a post expressing interest in social mobile game developers, Ozonian decided to reach out.
Game on · Mention Mobile’s newest game Word Derby lets players compete to try and create the best possible words from a pot of letters. — Courtesy of Chillingo
Eight minutes later, he received a reply that would, after two weeks of discussion, turn into a $250,000 investment. Ozonian was thunderstruck.
Two years before the email, Ozonian had just graduated from USC. Equipped with a major in communication and a minor in entrepreneurship, he teamed up with his brother and a friend to self-fund a social bookmarking project. The startup flopped, but Ozonian says the money lost was nothing compared to the hands-on experience.
“It was as good of a learning experience to do that on our own as it was to take four years of entrepreneurship classes,” he said. Needless to say, Ozonian pressed on.
He found himself at O Negative Media, a company that aimed to bring hit MySpace games to Facebook. He stayed through 2010 and early 2011, but after realizing that he wanted to go on to do bigger and better things, Ozonian left the company. He had the next three months to live on savings, his perseverance and an idea. So he played golf.
One fateful afternoon, Ozonian was paired by the course with a headhunter for various Los Angeles tech firms. After Ozonian’s mobile application ideas were exchanged over pars and bogeys, the headhunter gave Ozonian the contact information for Kory Jones, an iPad application developer in Los Angeles whose multimedia experience ranges from Star Wars to the Emmys.
“I remember telling him, ‘I have all these great ideas, all I need is a little bit of seed funding. Let’s see if we can create one of these games,’” Ozonian said with a smile. “He gave me the chance.”
Thirty thousand dollars in startup funding and an office space from Jones led Ozonian to create Mention Mobile, the company he currently co-runs with Jones. Together, they initially produced two Facebook games, Super Friends and Trivia Friends. The games didn’t reach the level of popularity that Ozonian expected, but he tried to stay focused on the positive.
“Our first attempts taught us that we knew we could execute on an idea. The moral to that story is that we knew we could do it,” he said. He never looked back.
The next item on the agenda was to develop a large-scale, asynchronous, turn-based game played between friends in which each person takes turns on his or her mobile device over the air (as with Words With Friends). That’s when Ozonian sent the email of his life. Mark Cuban’s endorsement gave Ozonian and Jones the money they needed to hire a small staff and begin development.
Ozonian has decided to share his success with the school he came from.
“Everyone I’ve tried to hire as interns have been from USC,” he said. “It’s awesome because I’m only four years out of school and able to bring on [students] is amazing.”
The staff of seven released Word Derby on Nov. 29. The app allows users to play games with up to four friends, where skillfully crafted words power avatars around a track toward the finish line. They partnered with Chillingo, the company behind games such as Angry Birds and Cut the Rope. After 30 million turns in one month, the game reached the second slot of the Apple App store’s top-50 word games and made the list of top-50 apps in the Apple App store.
“For a team of seven people, it’s been a pretty big success for us,” Ozonian said.
The team has plans to release an additional app in the spring, and Ozonian can barely contain his excitement.
Ozonian has not forgotten his roots. He explains how his experiences at USC motivated him to give younger Trojans the opportunity to work with him. As a student, he remembered how exciting the prospect of interning at a startup sounded.
“I wanted to be able to give back to the school I went to in one way or [another]. We have some of the most talented students,” he said.
Ozonian’s biggest advice to students looking to start up businesses is to stay persistent. He describes days when he didn’t feel confident in his ideas — days he knew he would have to get through to make his dreams become reality.
“I was scared that I could somehow take my ideas from paper and make them a reality,” Ozonian, “Eventually, I realized you have to keep trying and be as persistent as possible.”
Ozonian’s diligence paid off. After months of hard work, things simply fell into place.
As he describes it, “Had I never played golf that day, I never would have met Kory Jones. Had I never reached out to Cuban, I never would have received startup funding. As long as you’re working hard and what you have is quality and you continue to reach out to people, you can get pretty far.”

Coming into this weekend’s Lancer Invitational at Cal Baptist University, the USC women’s water polo team was ranked second in the nation and first among participating schools. After the final whistle of the game against Concordia on Saturday, the Women of Troy left no doubt that they were the team to beat in Riverside.
Energized by a selfless offense — the Women of Troy had 13 different scorers on the day — USC jumped out to an early 7-0, first-quarter lead and never looked back, going on to win the game 24-6.
Junior attacker Kelly Mendoza opened the scoring with two quick goals within the first two minutes, and junior driver Olivia Cummins added two more before the next minute had elapsed. Speed was the key for the Trojans’ offense as the team scored early and often — usually without a defender between the ball and the goal.
Along with Cummins, sophomore driver Monica Vavic led the team with four goals, including a scorching five-meter penalty shot that found the back of the net in the fourth quarter to put the Trojans up 23-3. Also tacking on goals for the Trojans were seniors drivers Constance Hiller and Dominique Sardo, juniors two-meters Kaleigh Gilchrist (3), Madeline Rosenthal, Colleen O’Donnell, sophomore driver Sara Salamon (2), freshmen two-meters Jayde Appel (2) and Courtney Walters (2) and freshman driver Emilie Myers.
Sardo, one of the team’s captains, wasn’t surprised at all by the number of different scorers. “We’re all confident in each other,” Sardo said. “We all trust each other to do the right things.”
Gilchrist, the other team captain, put it a little bit more bluntly.
“The ultimate goal is to win, you know? Who cares about stats? Who cares about goals?”
Maybe the players themselves aren’t concerned with their personal statistics, but you can bet that upcoming opponents will be wary of the offensive potential of this team.
Though the team has started strong, opening the season with a perfect 8-0 record, USC coach Jovan Vavic sees room for the squad to improve.
“We’ve got to play a little quicker,” Vavic said. “Sometimes we’re taking too long to make the next pass or to set each other up.”
The Women of Troy will look to keep up the winning streak this weekend as they enter the UCI Invitational in Irvine before conference play begins the following weekend.

The ladies, donned in beautiful long dresses, are touching up their make up, guaranteeing a perfect picture that each will remember for the rest of her life. The gentlemen linger in the foyer in their rented tuxedos, anxiously awaiting their Cinderellas to appear at the end of the hall.
It’s that time of year again: prom night, the infamous high school dance when students can wear their fanciest attire, bring a date and dance the night away. It’s often a night to remember and a night that younger freshmen and sophomores look forward to.
Unfortunately, this wish may not come true for certain students at Sullivan High School in Wabash Valley, Ind.
This year, there is a new demand for a “traditional” prom — a dance that does not allow any homosexuals to attend. Some students and teachers, all who attend the Sullivan First Christian Church, claim the dance would only perpetuate the idea that homosexuality is acceptable. Though the school itself claims that such a traditional prom would take place off school grounds and would not officially be sanctioned by the district, the problem of those attempting to force their homophobic agendas on the small town remains.
The proposal would certainly collide with the main purpose of education: to open the mind to new ideas and ways of thinking. With global connections expanding, these students are not too far away from being working adults in the professional world. If a simple event like a school dance discriminates against homosexuals, then students might take that home as a lesson. Looking at themselves as righteous, these young teenagers could enter the real world not accepting diversity in what is a very diverse world whether they like it or not.
High school is a place of learning, both academically and socially. One learns how to treat another person the way he or she wishes to be treated. Segregating those who don’t “fit into the mold” only teaches young students that everyone in this world is not, in fact, created equal.
In a time when same-sex marriage debates are playing out across the country, it is important to begin the march toward equality at the smallest level, especially when the danger that gay teens experience increases daily.
According to the Huffington Post, gay teens in conservative areas without programs that support gay rights attempt suicide significantly more than straight teens. In a study with 32,000 subjects, roughly 20 percent of gay teens stated that they had attempted suicide while a mere four percent of straight teens said that they had. Constant bullying and segregation only contributes to this epidemic.
Those wanting a traditional prom need to realize that holding a prom that invites all is not a way of brainwashing America’s youth. Once citizens begin to realize that homosexuality is not a disease or a choice but simply a fact of life, then we all can start to properly live by our constitution, which guarantees the right to liberty and happiness for all.
Religious freedom is sacred in this country, but the United States also has a duty to protect its citizens — regardless of their sexual orientation. If members of Sullivan First Christian Church and Sullivan High so desperately desire to rob students from a momentous night in a high school student’s life, then they cannot say that they believe in the founding ideals of our nation.

This condemnation is ridiculous. At USC, we had a LGBT Prom last year which I assume was exclusively for the LGBT community and allies. If some folks want to start a traditional prom independently, that’s their right to do so. Instead of whining (which liberals are so exceptionally good at), you should (or folks in that town) start a LGBT prom – EVEN tho they are already invited to the regular, sanctioned prom. Its like anything else – quit complaining if someone privately makes their club or event exclusive and make your own if you care so much.
Force. Government is force. Do we really need the government to force people to include government favored groups of people into their lives?
Does government force allow the pursuit of happiness for all or only the government protected groups?
Is there a concept of privacy left in this country?
Are individuals or groups of individuals allowed to choose with whom to associate?
Is not choice a natural right?
Is there any choice that is still reserved to individual persons or are all decisions subject to government veto?
Rich,
One can’t observe the fact that people have the same right to host a private non-gay prom as much as gays have a right to live their lives, and then complain that stories are being published calling out homophobia. The general public has as much of a right to publish stories (en masse) calling out homophobia in society just as much as people have a right to be homophobic. As far as gays “respecting” heterosexuals’ explicit and vocal disgust for their natural instincts, well that itself is a two-way street. If heterosexuals are justified in showing disgust for gays’ natural instincts toward each other, then gays are just as justified in showing disgust, offense, and incredulity at those heterosexual reactions. Personally, I don’t think the way toward change is found with mutual respect for one another’s active disgust and contempt.
When you label everything homophobic, nothing is homophobic.
My point being, stop trying to make it look like the straight person is a evil mean person because they have natural instinct to be repulsed by gay behaviour. The more you do that, the more thicker the wall gets for most people.
Christians have just as much a right to be offended by the behaviour of those of the gay community as those of the gay community have a right to live their lives. Since this prom is private, they have a right to invite whomever they want. That being said, I would like to see a day when being gay isn’t a big deal. It is natural for a straight person to be disgusted by two people of the same sex kissing etc…it’s the way the straight brain works. Until that’s accepted and respected by the gay population, nothing will change. This type of change needs to be a two way street of respect and consideration.

In regard to Pi Kappa Phi’s “Phi-esta”
I am proud of who I am. I am Catholic, liberal and sometimes a little outspoken. This is one of those times. I am a Trojan through and through, but first, I am a woman of Mexican-American descent.
A couple weeks ago, the students of the Duke Asian Student Alliance held a protest against a “racist rager” that took place on the Duke University campus. This protest, with over 500 people in attendance, received national recognition in the media. These students banded together to protest a fraternity party in which other students dressed as different Asian stereotypes, openly mocking Asian culture with costumes, words and hand gestures. Shockingly, the Asian students of the campus took offense.
Now, only two weeks later, a fraternity at USC is throwing its very own “racist rager.” The brothers of Pi Kappa Phi are holding a “phi-esta.” That in itself does not seem too concerning, but when accompanied by a blatantly racist photo and a statement saying that partygoers should bring their “sombreros and accentos to a night of classy fun,” the mockery starts to peek through. The description then goes on to clear up any confusion about what to wear by encouraging viewers to look to the photo depicting two shirtless Mexican men in sombreros for inspiration.
I love a fiesta and a good margarita as much as the next girl, but not when it is just an excuse to make racist jokes and poke fun at a different culture. There is a big difference between celebrating a culture and mocking it.
A few hours after the event was posted, the description was edited to include “what not to expect”: “border patrol, pickpockets, those kids selling you chicle gum, [and] Montezuma’s Revenge.” Classy, indeed.
Is this what Mexican culture has been reduced to? An entire country, an entire people, an entire tradition is recognized solely by negative stereotypes. Is it not possible to hold a party without the predictably offensive costumes and mocking accents? Will it be less of a good time if guests refrain from obvious racism? I highly doubt it.
It is offensive that race is so easily used as a party theme. This is not the first “fiesta” and I am sure that it will not be the last, but I’m not waiting for the party to be over before I speak up.
I’m not waiting for the pictures of drawn-on mustaches, illegal immigrants and gardeners to make the rounds on Facebook. I’m not waiting for my heritage to be ridiculed before I start my protest.
This is my protest. This is me speaking up for what I believe in. This is me taking a stand.
Though I find this event to be utterly disrespectful, I mostly just find it disappointing. I refuse to believe that other students on the USC campus — other members of the Trojan family — can be so ignorant and reckless. We live in Southern California with one of the most ethnically diverse campuses in the country, yet we still face situations like these.
If you read this and think I am overreacting, then I am sorry for you. I am sorry that you do not understand.
I am Mexican and proud, and I very much take offense.
 
Melissa Morales
Junior, Political Science
Everyone is entitled to their opinions and insults.
What I find funny is that fact that Melissa Morales isn’t actually from or holds residency in Mexico.. She probably doesn’t even have a Mexican passport.
So, coming from an actual Mexican, I find it more offensive that someone like Melissa who isn’t even from Mexico, is using cultural sensitivity to get her article in the spotlight.
Don’t get me wrong, ethnicity is ethnicity and I am not degrading her as a Mexican for not being from Mexico. The stereotypes highlighted however, directly impact Mexicans from Mexico. So for a person who has never had to confront these stereotypes in Mexico, or its insulting to Mexicans from Mexico, that they would try and take advantage of the tension with Mexico and America in order to solidify her article’s credibility.
 As a Mexican who resides in a border-town…”If you read this and think I am overreacting, then I am sorry for you. I am sorry that you do not understand.” You are overreacting, I feel sorry for you that you have to use your minority complex(which at this point is debatable since your from pasadena, NOT MEXICO) to get your 15 minutes of fame, I feel sorry for you that you do not understand satire.
Such a ridiculous overreaction. Where was this girl when there was a “Delts of Hazzard” that encouraged party goers to dress up as “white trash” and “rednecks” for the night? Seems as though she is a bit selective in her protests. 
More importantly, to insinuate that this was intended to be anything more than a light-hearted themed party is laughable.
probably at delta of hazard… after all, she is in gphi
Oh come on Melissa stop stirring the pot. The Pi Kapp fraternity clearly had no intention of insulting or demeaning the Mexican race. They were putting on a Mexican themed party and listed a few things most Americans tend to associate Mexico with (sombreros, mariachi, border patrol). I don’t see the Mexican community crying foul on Cinco de Mayo when Americans are having the exact same themed parties (sombreros, tequila, drawn on mustaches). I also doubt you have felt this way after Cinco de Mayo celebrations in the past.  
While Pi Kapp’s event description was insensitive to say the least, labeling the party a “racist rager” is stirring the pot. I don’t see anyway the fraternity could be called racist (usually defined as a hate for another race or believing one race is superior to another). They were simply playing with the stereotypes commonly associated with Mexico. 
Throwing the term “racist” around in modern America is extremely provocative and is probably what has gotten this article so much attention. However, in the future you should consider the power and effect of using such a word before you attack an entire fraternity and college’s character.
This entire thread is so disappointing.
I have never been so, so disappointed with the Greek system. 
First of all, all of these comments 
1) supporting the removal of this post
2) hating on the Gamma Phi sorority (who didn’t even bring themselves into, was dragged into a terrible analogy by Drew from Pi Kapp – they merely defended themselves)
3) commenting  that if you are ugly or a GDI or a low tier organization you don’t deserve an opinion
all solidifies the fact that the Greek system believes they are entitled. They are entitled organizations of students who pay thousands of dollars more than the non-Greek students for “programming” (aka. mixers, date dashes, “philanthropies”, registers, thursday night parties, a frat house) hence they deserve to rise above criticism.
I may not agree with what Melissa has done, but she has a right to point out what she does not agree with. 
I also agree that the fraternities and sororities of USC have a right to defend themselves. But with logical arguments. I think that if you offend someone, albeit unintentionally, the best thing to do for you and your reputation is to apologize and explain yourself – not be defensive and inflammatory in return. 
Please do not defend yourself by saying you are trying to be satirical or that other fraternities throw similar parties or that the fact that “I’m also Hispanic and I have no problem with it.”
That does not change the fact of the matter that she was offended. 
Pi Kapp, instead of flaming her and coming up with excuses, please contact her personally and resolve this issue. The people you’re allowing to post on your behalf is definitely doing worse for your reputation than Melissa’s commentary
What is truly disappointing is that you let your privilege and upbringing blind you to the truth.  Contact her?  Talk about it?  There is no time for talking.  Now is a time of action.  Growing up white and rich makes you think you can always talk your way out of everything.
I’m actually Asian. And I’m on a full scholarship. My family are all immigrants. I’m not quite sure what your argument is saying.
I’m confused… I feel like we agree with each other. I think that the best way to resolve this in the best way for everyone involved is to talk about it. Open discussion and communication is powerful. 
What exactly do you mean “Now is a time for action…” 
Please clarify what you’re trying to say
As a Trojan from the Class of 2011, this unfortunate revelation from the row is deeply embarrassing. I love a good rager as much as the next bro, but demeaning an entire culture like this is completely uncool and backwards. It further propagates the notion – true or untrue – that the Greek system is little more than a bunch of Good Ole Boys.
I believe you, Melissa, should have put much more thought into this article. Do you realize the potential harm you’ve brought to this fraternity, your own sorority and the USC row in general? I have a feeling the Gamma Phi social calendar will be shrinking… How are frats supposed to put a mixer together without some sort of theme that could potentially be considered racist? How about Sigma Chis around the world where every room was themed as a different stereotype? Are you going to consider their American Pi Kapp racist towards Americans?
Gamma Phi social calendar shrinking?  hahaha, its already been shrunked.
Look at this mess.  All of you are Trojans and unless I’m mistaken, we are called the Trojan family for a reason.  Here is a member of that family expressing how she feels about how her culture and heritage has been misrepresented and all some of you can do is argue with her emotions.  As much as you say, in an attempt to defend yourself and your organization against the information published, the simple fact remains that Pi Kappa Phi had some descriptions on the event that were in bad taste. No amount of arguing is going to change that. I don’t know how many of you have ever legitimately experienced racism and prejudice in your lives but for some it is a daily thing and USC is supposed to be a place where that stuff doesn’t happen.  If the party is a celebration for Cinco de Mayo, as some claim, then change up the description to show some more respect to the culture as a whole. Easy fix. This isn’t a CEOs and Office Hos theme where you are supposed to make crude descriptions and muck up the idea, this is a celebration, according to some of the bros that have posted, so make it into a positive one.
I know that the brothers of Pi Kappa Phi are intelligent Trojan men and it’s up to them to turn the negative into a positive by revamping the event image and understanding that it’s possible to offend even when the offense was unintentional. This doesn’t make them racist or insensitive it makes them uninformed and if no one is willing to step up and communicate then they also allowed the situation to occur.
I respect your opinion and your statements Melissa but I hope that in the future you take the time to educate your fellow Trojans and give them a legitimate chance to change things before making anyone into a villain.  If you can express yourselves to the entire USC community, why did you not express yourself directly to the people that you took offense with?  Open communication and mutual understanding is always better than image smearing and accusations.
Instead of conflict, this could have been an opportunity to bridge gaps between Trojan family members and show some much needed love and understanding.
Are you suggestion they make sure to invite the gardener and everything will be alright?
Then why are you arguing???  Pi Kapp please stop your self-promotion and trolling.
To everyone who is writing critical comments, I hope you realize that you can be proud of being in a fraternity or being part of the Greek system while also being critical of some of its activities and being open to hearing criticisms. Actually, it should make you more proud to see that people within your system are open-minded, critical thinkers, because often the Greek system is (maybe unfairly) stereotyped as close-minded and sheep-like.
To the author, thank you for writing this article. Don’t listen to the hate in the comments section. What you did by writing this was brave and admirable.
The most tiresome stage of these controversies is the part where the offending group or individuals tries to turn it around like they’re the ones being persecuted. The event description was clearly insensitive. The only way you would not think that it was is if you’re part of an in group which has never experienced broad insensitivity toward your identity. As a white guy, I’ve never  been discriminated against based on my skin color at USC, but as a gay man, I have faced insensitivity based on my sexual orientation. My point is, even if you are of the particular out group that is being made fun of, you do not get to declare that the person who has raised concerns about conduct is over reacting. Personally I would not have written to the DT if another fraternity choose to have a fag night and drink cocktails and “dress gay” as one memorably did my freshman year, but Melissa’s choice to air her concerns is valid. She didn’t call for the fraternity to be shut down, or even for the party to be canceled. She merely pointed out that the rhetoric coming from the fraternity was offensive to her. The defensive posturing of several men claiming to be from the frat on this board seems to me to be an unfortunate fight or flight reaction. Hiding behind the semantic argument that Mexican is not a race is just a straw man argument. Being Mexican identified in this country means dealing with many of the stereotypes in the party’s description during your life. I don’t care if you have the party, I don’t particularly care if it stays Mexican themed, just own up to the fact you made comments that could reasonably be considered insensitive, where a wide audience could view them. Apologize to the people who were offended and get on with you’re lives. The apology will cost you nothing and might go a long way to preventing this from turning into a much bigger deal than it has to be.
I can automatically see what’s wrong with the party, but I find it strange that members of the fraternity can’t or aren’t even attempting to empathize. Moreover,  I’m concerned that minority students are essentially bashing these organizations instead of pushing for a healthy dialogue about why this is “hurtful” and seeking some reasonable behavior changes…
I think we as minorities tend to take it for granted that the vast majority of those who don’t identify as minorities have next to no idea of what is culturally sensitive and why it’s culturally sensitive. We also don’t give them an equal footing to express their perspectives outside of defending themselves from being attacked in media as “racist”. (Even though I don’t think Melissa says anything about the people being racist but rather that what they are doing has racist connotations)
It sucks but it’s our job as those who are “sensitive” to these issues to educate others that don’t see this, I think, reasonable perspective. Regardless, it’s probably what has to happen if you want people to actually treat others respectfully…

More minorities = lower tier.
Melissa,
You need not be so offended here.  Phi Kappa Phi from what I understand is a lower tier house and very few if any would have attended this Mexican themed party.   You have done nothing but bring attention and publicity to this fraternity and likely this party will have move attendees as a result.  Sometimes it is best to keep things like this to yourself.  Likely as you mature, you will learn this as a valuable life lesson.
Best of Luck!
Truly Sad Melissa, 
I just Googled “USC Phi Kap…” to learn more about them and Google auto-populated the words “Racism and Racist” and linked to this article.   Melissa, you may have permanently defamed these boys with your article.   I spoke with my son who’s in another fraternity earlier this morning and he said Phi Kap may have been on the rise on the row.   Still solidly lower tier but rising with a recent larger pledge class.  I’m not sure how this other commenter came up with middle tier. 
You likely owe them an apology!
What I find funny about this letter and all the responses is that the houses in question here are totally irrelevent.  Gamma Phi is is in the lower tier of sororities. Pi Kapp is lower middle tier at best with fraternities.  Both of these houses try so hard to be relevent, but just aren’t.  I smell a lot of self promotion going on on this board.  No one cares about your Piestas and Italian all you can eat buffet fundraisers.
Let me start by saying I am big fan of the Mexican culture.  I love Taco Bell, Del Taco, Chipotle and soccer.   I further believe salsa is by far the best condiments created to date.   The Mexican people are some of the kindest and warm hearted people on the planet.   Melissa, you are just plain wrong and your article does nothing to promote Mexican culture or bring any light to this situation.   How did a real Mexican get a name like Melissa?  Some how I doubt your parents, pushing one of those bacon-wrap hotdog carts after the SC home games (BTW: Delicious!) gave you a name like Melissa.  Far too “white-bread” of name for a proper Mexican girl.   Do you even care that your people have stolen the American hotdog, wrapped it with bacon and claimed it as there own?   I do!  I want our uniquely American food back!   I’m mad and disgusted your people have stolen our hotdog and you need to change your name.   Once you have corrected this, I am happy to take you seriously.
Where is the best place get a good sombrero and a welfare check?  I want to look totally authentic.
The way that this was handled is pathetic.  If Melissa would have contacted the fraternity about her concerns, I am absolutely certain they would have responded positively.  Instead, she writes to the Daily Trojan in hope that she will get her 15 minutes of fame for creating “Duke 2.0.”  It is pathetic.
Agreed.
Responded by claiming the event is satire, intended to draw attention to harmful stereotypes?
I literally do not see what the big deal is. Every themed party that occurs on the row (I assume you know this since you’re in Gamma Phi) takes on some type of stereotype and it really seems like no one even notices anything wrong with any of them until something like the Duke protest makes national attention and stirs up the inner-activists in people who have, hypocritically and ironically, probably been to a themed party at one point or another. What’s next? Cancel the next Western themed party because it makes fun of cowboys? Cancel the next America themed party because we’re dressing up like Americans and mocking our own country? Cancel the next Around The World party because it makes fun of everyone? God forbid. No one is making fun of anyone. We are so obsessed with being politically correct and what’s not politically correct these days that it is actually just so ridiculous. Clearly Pi Kapp isn’t trying to be mean-spirited as much as they are trying to be fun and drunk-spirited (is that a thing?). For example, I am Chinese, and both my parents are from China. Did I boycott Sigma China last year? Of course not. People don’t throw these parties to be hurtful, so just because someone with thin skin finds it offensive doesn’t automatically make it racist, especially when the large majority of the stereotype in question is perfectly fine with it.  No one else thought anything of this which goes to show you that events like this are not a big deal until someone with nothing better to do blows it out of proportion like you did.
Thank you. You have taken the words right out of my mouth.
#totaldebmove #tdm
You know the Western theme comparison does not make sense considering cowboys are not a race. LOL Racial stereotypes are much more hurtful than that. TRY AGAIN! 
If you do not see that it is a big please stop being ignorant and see both sides of the picture.
I never said cowboys were a race, I said they were part of a stereotype. Clearly you are not as smart as you think you are because “Mexican” isn’t a race either (races are based on genetics and skin color… Ex. there are White people and Black people and Asian people who are citizens of Mexico). Both are cultures (though Mexicans obviously share a nationality, which is not the same thing as race), so why would “mocking” Cowboys be okay when to you, “mocking” Mexicans clearly is not?
Furthermore, they are part of an ethnicity that is not even considered a race. According to the US Census Bureau:
Hispanic or Latino origin is independent of race and is termed “ethnicity” by the United States Census Bureau. The racial categories are: American Indian and Alaska Native, White, Black or African American, Asian, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, Some other race, and Two or more races. The distinction made by government agencies for those within the population of each race category is between those of Hispanic or Latino origin, and all others of Non-Hispanic or Latino origin.
Your last sentence also makes no sense at all. I’m ignorant and don’t see both sides of the picture because I don’t think that this party is a big deal? Can’t I say that you’re ignorant and don’t see both sides of the picture because you do think this party is a big deal? Yep.
In attempt to come off as condescending and intellectually superior, you have made yourself look so stupid, and I sincerely hope it was not with this ignorance that you were accepted into USC. 
I am not going to argue with someone who hides behind a screen and uses “Anon” as their name because they aren’t confident enough to publicly stand behind their words. Feel free to message me on Facebook if you would genuinely like to continue this conversation (though I can’t say I’m too interested in your opinion). facebook/deborah.y.liu
^^^^Finally, someone with some common sense.
I agree that the debate over themed parties is getting out of hand and may ruin light hearted fun.
However, I think it is perfectly valid for someone to bring up an issue with it. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and it is okay to be offended. It is okay as a gay person, to be offended that someone uses “gay” as a derogatory term. It does not matter so much the intent (while it is worthy to note) but the effect it has on people.
I also disagree that a majority of the “stereotype” in question does not have a problem with it. Please look up “false-consensus effect”. I’m happy for you that you are able to overcome cultural sensitivity in good fun, but that definitely doesn’t hold true for some people. And to be fair, most people in the Greek system are of Caucasian descent. So, I’m not quite sure where you are getting the “majority of people are okay with it” – because no one protests?
Well here is one lady protesting her opinion, and suddenly she is the crazy psycho minority who is trying to ruin it for the “majority”. 
I’m of Chinese descent as well, and I have only once attended Sigma China – never again. I was there for ten minutes, and then out. Why? I walked and  80% of the party was made up of Caucasian people who were wasted – drinking and grinding and hooking up in kimonos, “rice” costumes, farmer costumes, Asian mom costumes, or skimpy outfits + chopsticks in hair. 
I get that it wasn’t meant to be offensive. But it was. It was incredibly offensive to me. My grandparents are still farmers in China. They work very hard every day just to make a simple living. They eat rice, everyday. 
And here was a party, celebrating stereotypes based on them because it was funny for said partiers. How clever could you be with your costume? I remember a guy who walked out in all white and said he was rice. He immediately proceeded to get high fived by multiple people who all commented on how hilarious his costume was.
To be fair, beyond just party themes, I have encountered students who have yelled racist things on me at the Row. 
I have been yelled at for walking home with my Caucasian boyfriend. Six sorority/fraternity students hanging out on an unnamed house’s lawn yelled “the asian thing is so over, why are you going home with an asian girl?” and various comments about “fetishes” and “yellow fever.”
I am a human being first and foremost, beyond my race. I do not think the Row is completely free from racism. I think it definitely exists. And while this racism may not stem from negative intent and while these parties are light hearted and I do think people are allowed to enjoy them, please do not overlook the fact that racism does exist, and it is okay for people to voice their opinions about them – especially when they are offended.
Just because you think someone is being too PC, doesn’t mean you aren’t being boorish.
It’s a bit unfair to deem this party a “racist rager” but maybe insensitive is a better word. I think we can all agree that this party was well intentioned. But don’t kid yourselves, you didn’t organize this fiesta to celebrate Mexican culture, you’re just using Mexican culture as an excuse to party (which is fine). As a minority, I can take these little jabs but they do add up, and maybe this just broke Melissa’s tolerance threshold. Again, it isn’t ignorance but rather insensitivity that can make someone feel uncomfortable, and one should not feel uncomfortable amongst their peers. 
On a slightly less diplomatic note, the overwhelming sense of entitlement that some individuals have displayed through these comments, many of which are coming from the said fraternity, is painful to read. Don’t get all butt hurt just because someone is challenging you, bro.
^cosign
I am a pi kapp pledge. Both my parents immigrated here from Mexico and my first language is Spanish and grew up in the streets of LA. I still believe this theme is hilarious
With all due respect, you may think this theme is hilarious, but you have to be aware of the opinions of others- the party was for everyone to attend, and sometimes humor doesn’t translate in the manner than you think it might.
John:
Actually, not really. Like one of the members of the fraternity itself said, there was a line crossed. Border patrol isn’t evoked for people in Mexico. The pickpockets and [poor] kids selling you gum is preceded by “what not to expect.” You know, as if that’s what these Pi Kappa guys consider a trip to Mexico like. Which obviously suggests these guys don’t need to party, they need to read a book.
“Comments meant to..provoke a response”? Oh, you mean like words?
And with your use of analogy we could also say, “why let men join fraternities, it just perpetuates the stereotype of the dull, druggie, tasteless male.”
Which oh goodness, we certainly know is not true.
Though let’s have THAT theme party. <–(That's satire.)
I'm kidding. Of course that would be in bad taste. And probably a little boring in my opinion.
ps. To that guy making "A Bold Claim," you don't make sense. First you say she's making a "bold" accusation to call everyone affiliated with that party a racist. Then you say "maybe you're not slandering the attendees." You can't have both. 
And btw, there's a difference between Mark Twain and the "description's creator." Mark Twain was funny.
obviously the guys dont think mexico is just border patrol & kids selling gum, since that is just the border, not even mexico. By saying that is ‘what not to expect’ they are acknowledging how bad that stuff is.
i’d be be down for a ‘frat’ themed party. it would be like Jimmy Tatro’s videos: a mockery of ‘frat’ culture. i think it would be funny, but we can never have a themed party because somewhere in the world might find it offensive.
Sorry it was hard for you to understand Sam. I said I believed she was accusing everyone who would have attended the party of being racist. Then i thought that maybe that’s not the case. Maybe she isn’t slandering the attendees, just the party description writer. Then i wrote a response to that. In other words i wrote a response to both possibilities because i didn’t want to assume one or the other because i don’t know what Melissa thinks.
I told this to someone else but apparently it was unclear: I asked Melissa if she understood Mark Twain novels: ‘Do you appreciate Mark Twain?’. Mark Twain is a famous satirist so if she understood Mark Twain she should clearly see the very cheesy satire in the party description.
What are we supposed to do when it’s Cinco de Mayo?!?!
First I’d like to say that some of the truly hurtful, slanderous, rude, & tasteless comments on here should not be implied to be from a brother of Pi Kappa Phi. 
To Melissa,
I’m bitter sweetly enjoyed that you brought this up because I wanted to address the Duke article this morning. Now it is even more relevant to me.
I find YOUR letter to be utterly disrespectful to my fraternity. I also find it disappointing. I refuse to believe that other students on the USC campus — other members of the Trojan family — can be so ignorant and reckless. To follow you in making the extremely bold accusation of calling me, my fraternity, & everyone who will attend this party a racist with such little evidence or knowledge of even a fraction of them.
Regardless, I question you motives for writing this article. I may assume you’re riding the skirt tails of the aforementioned Duke article because it is extremely likely that you’ve been to a themed party that you have not gone up-in-arms about. In this case I wish you’d have thought about the consequences your inflammatory article would make before you impulsively tried to take ‘racist ragers’ viral. You may have likely ruined an otherwise good time for many people. Further, your lone article may have slandered the reputation of my fraternity & detracted from the years of blood, time, sweat, money, & tears of every man that has worked to build a positive reputation for it over the years. Also, you have ironically drawn attention to your stereotyping of fraternity culture with your assumptions towards our intentions & beliefs without knowing us & before we even held this event.
However; maybe you are not slandering the attendees but the description’s creator. In this case you truly do not understand satire. Do you not appreciate Mark Twain? Do you not understand the effectiveness of comedy to delicately & indirectly bring to light controversial issues? Do you not appreciate the role of Feste in ‘The Twelfth Night’? Do you take ‘Team America’ so literally that you do not understand the stereotypes it brings to light through mockery that would otherwise cause conflict if address through another medium? Do you find the Mexican section of ‘Small World’ at Disneyland to be racist because the majority of boys are wearing sombreros… everyone in Mexico doesn’t wear a sombrero & dance all day right?
I’m in the house & you retaliated so quickly that you’ve seen things on the description even I hadn’t. Much of what you have a problem with was immediately taken down when we saw that it could be deemed offensive by people who take things too literally & cannot appreciate satire without a lengthy legal disclaimer. Personally I would have left every controversial, blatantly stereotypical, & clearly satirical statement on that description because it brought to light the fact that all those stereotypes still exist. Also, nothing in the description encouraged ‘gardener’ or ‘illegal immigrant’ costumes. I don’t see what you expect people to wear if not a sombrero & a Mexican accent (things I find quite beautiful for people to experience) since if it was a truly literal Hispanic party everyone would show up in normal clothes right? By saying what to bring & ‘what not to expect’ we were encouraging people to avoid stereotypical costumes related to border patrol, child labor, & crime in favor of sombreros & accents. By the way accent’o’s is satire on the many people who do not understand the Spanish language’s use of gender distinction in words. It’s a subtle joke reminding people that not all words in the Spanish language have an ‘o’ attached. Good to know that literary device fell on deaf ears =/
If you read this and think I am under-reacting, then I am sorry for you. I am sorry that you do not understand satire.
I am Mexican and proud, and I very much take offense to this article.
Proud to Be
PROUD TO BE!
swole
Mark Twain? lolz
HAHA! Oh yes. A brilliant satirical piece utterly ruined by social consciousness. You poor poor thing. I might have to print this out and bring it to one of my classes. Hands down the most illogical series of arguments I’ve seen in a while. 
I don’t even think your aware of how satire actually functions……
How dare Melissa interrupt such an intellectual endeavor, such a “delicate” display of cultural analysis, such an illuminating example of tropes that would otherwise be ignored and forgotten by the ignorant masses.
Lily J
While I hate to be “that” guy, I just could not help but notice that your attempted eloquence in your comment (against the previously written post) contained a very basic grammar mistake.
Please at least pretend to proof-read your comment before you go about making fun of other people. Big words and fancy sentence structure does not make you seem any smarter or better than the people you are trying to belittle, when you can’t even get a simple concept like “you’re” and “your” correct.  
The fact that someone like yourself would try to represent an idea or (God forbid), this institution, with mistakes and an attitude like that scares me more than the thought that a few frat guys just wanted to have an excuse to drink tequila and have an easy costume theme.
The description is full of sarcastic, blatantly racist stereotypes so the writer clearly does not believe what he wrote & is therefore not trying to be racist. It was very very blatant satire…
Satire:  use of wit to criticize behavior: the use of wit, especially irony, sarcasm, and ridicule, to criticize faults 
to help you understand: the writer used SARCASM to CRITICIZE FAULTS. Those faults are the commonly held stereotypes about Hispanic culture.
Also, next time i’ll use bullet points. I did address a lot of loosely connected issues. I can understand how it may have been hard for you to follow.
^ I just laughed reading your post Lily. Intellectual endeavor? What are you smoking? (Must be some crazy marijuana). How about demeaning a whole fraternity and attempting to tarnish their reputation? Think before you write.
Homeboy compared his fraternity’s sorry excuse for satire to Mark Twain……..
Let’s be real, if your Thursday night party really was such a clever parody of harmful Mexican stereotypes, why would your brothers be scurrying around trying to play this off as a cultural celebration? Cause the public can’t handle your literary genius?
I did not compare what was probably a 5 minutes of thought party description to works by Mark Twain. I was asking Melissa if understands Mark Twain (‘do you appreciate Mark Twain?’) because he is known for his satire & if she cant see blatant satire in the party description she probably doesn’t see it in a sophisticated Mark Twain piece.
And it probably got taken down because its much easier to appease sensitive people like Melissa & continue about our days then deal with a massive conflict. I say in my message that i’d have loved to leave it up & make it even more stereotypical because you’re supposed to hate who wrote it. The writer intentionally embodies an ignorant bigot to make you disagree with his stereotypes & realize how stupid it would be to be like him & hold those same stereotypes.
i cant understand how literally this was taken. Someone intentionally acts like a racist to mock the ignorance of  stereotypes & people actually believed the writer is racist.
Hahaha, you guys try so hard but you are so lower middle tier.  Stop self promoting on the DT.
And you must be a gdi.
As philanthropy chair of Gamma Phi Beta, I just want to clarify that there was no theme to our “Have a Heart” philanthropy event. Drew, perhaps if you had stopped by to support our cause, you would have been better informed. The purpose of “all you can eat,” which has been a tradition for this particular philanthropy, was not meant to be associated with “Italy’s problem with obesity” whatsoever. The point of “all you can eat” for $5, was my attempt to get as many people to come to our philanthropy as possible, so we could raise as much money as we can to help support USC Troy Camp and the McPherson Foundation, which is founded by one of our sister’s family.  In addition, I chose spaghetti as the meal out of consideration for our chef, who has to cook for 300+ guests and spaghetti is convenient and easy to make. It shocks me that you would even label a candid and genuine philanthropy as “racist” based on your own false assumptions, and then compare it to a fraternity party, calling them “very similar.” Assuming that your party was in fact, “planned with good intent,” it is still widely different from the purpose of a philanthropy.
This is the problem exactly. People see things differently. Some see the party as racist, some see your philanthropy as racist, and some see neither as racist. In fact, the people who planned both were not trying to be racist but there were aspects that may have seemed racist.
what?
I most definitely did not see your philanthropy as racist at all. Please reread that paragraph of my comment. I most definitely wrote about the absurdity of that statement. My point was that anything can be seen as anything under a very narrow lens.
Sorry for the confusion.
Drew
drew… get outta here
By definition, for something to be racist, it has to target a particular race.
“Mexican” is not a race, any more than “American” is a race.  Rather, it is a culture and a national identity.
You mean to using some form of the word “stereotype.”  Precise word choice is important when constructing a persuasive argument.
Finally someone pointed this out!
Okay, so instead of “racist”, let’s use the term “bigoted”.  Bigotry instead of racism.  Now what?
I graduated from SC in 2012 and was in a fraternity for 3 1/2 years. I find it hilarious that suddenly this is a big deal. In my time at SC we threw at least one “South of the Border” party every semester and no one ever said a word. My only guess as to why this party is getting bad press is because maybe it is a registered and a description was made on Facebook.
We also had Hawaiian themed parties where we swapped sombreros for aloha shirts. Where was the outrage then? Shouldn’t that have been a stereotype aimed at Hawaiians? If you are so proud of being Mexican then why are you so offended when others want to wear something that celebrates your culture while celebrating the weekend with their friends?
The real reason they chose this theme, and let’s be real, is because it’s an easy theme to dress up for, they probably like tequila, and they want to get drunk in a festive environment. I highly doubt the reason was to mock Mexicans and I guarantee there are Mexican Americans in their house who are treated as equals. I understand that the description did get out of hand a bit and why some of it offended you, but I refuse to think that parties such as these are a full on mockery of Mexican culture. Oh yeah and one more thing I’m also Mexican. And I’m proud.
HE DOESNT EVEN GO HERE!
Whatever the disagreements may or may not be, I think this post should come down. While Melissa posits a valid argument, demeaning the fraternity as a whole is unfair to those associated with it and who did not make the event description. Some may argue that it was in bad taste others may disagree. I think for the benefit of both Pi kappa phi and Melissa, this post should be taken down. Pi kappa phi realizes its mistake and will handle the situation accordingly. Melissa’s voice was heard and the fraternity responded by removing the event. It is not their intention to instigate negativity towards anyone or any race and taking the event down shows that we acknowledge that. For the credibility of the fraternity, I think this is the work of one person and the whole fraternity should not be punished for it. Good day to all and God bless
It’s more than just the event description. It’s the event in its entirety, and I’m sure that one person is not solely responsible for the entire event. Taking this post down silences a valid point. It sends the message that making sure a fraternity looks good is more important than bringing attention to racism at USC. Even if Pi Kappa Phi truly understands that their actions were wrong, and based on Drew’s response I don’t believe that’s the case, the fact that people are making comments on this article in defense of the party says that there’s a larger group of people who don’t understand the issue. People don’t see a problem, and that’s the very reason why people need to see this letter.
Lauren, you saying that there is a problem is your own opinion. I’m not going to comment on what I think of the party, I just want to say that you thinking there is a problem is your opinion. I personally think that it is absolutely ridiculous for you to think that every single person should see this as a problem. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I don’t think that you should not be saying that one opinion is either right or wrong, because an opinion cannot be right or wrong. There is nothing wrong with expressing your opinion, but please don’t try to force your opinion on others and say that any opinion that is not yours is wrong. It’s just not fair.
It’s really sad if you think it is an “opinion” that we need to address the fact that racism is still such a huge problem in America.
PS “opinion” count in your comment: 8
Her views of the party is her opinion. I highly doubt pi kapp meant anything bad/racist/malicious by it and by this thread, I think it’s obvious that many people believe the fraternity did not mean anything bad by it. Her thinking this is bad or inappropriate is her opinion. Many believe there’s an issue with the party, many don’t. All I’m saying is she shouldn’t try to say that people who feel differently than her are wrong.
PS who cares how many times I said opinion.
Racism isn’t the problem here. People being easily offended by what they believe to be racism seems to be the problem. Racism implies coming from a place of hate, and trying to bring down or belittle a group. From what I can tell, that’s not the case in this particular situation. Some of the words or phrases used in this Facebook event may have been a bit off-color, but I don’t think that the person who wrote the event page or the house as a whole was doing it with any hatred intended, but rather comedy or satire. Using this as evidence that “racism is still such a huge problem in America” is like watching Tosh.0 and and getting the same conclusion. And really, I’m guessing all anyone wanted was an easy party theme and everything has gotten blown out of proportion. If the event page was written with better tact, this party would have gone down just like every other Mexican or Cinco de Mayo themed party.
“Racism implies coming from a place of hate, and trying to bring down or belittle a group.”
Yeah no……..
Let us open a book on Sociology no? Intention does not define oppression….
Definition 1 on Merriam-Webster: “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race ”
I’d say that there’s an implication of hatred and/or belittling based on this definition of racism.
Also, please tell me where anything that has been said promoted a sense of inherent superiority of a race. Sombreros, border patrol, and kids selling gum are examples of racial stereotyping perhaps, but I wouldn’t say that naming those things necessarily means that this person believes that his race is inherently better than another’s.
I am appalled that you would think an entire fraternity to be racist. Your claim proves your ignorance. People see the problem, and that’s why the event was taken down. I don’t understand what is so hard for you to see here. And its not about “looking good”, more about not being STEREOTYPED OURSELVES AS RACIST, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT. Again, it was one person’s actions, not the actions of every single member of the fraternity. If this is not sufficient enough for you to understand, I’ll give you my e-mail and explain to you more thoroughly what has ACTUALLY transpired.
I agree with Drew. Anything can be contorted to be much more severe than it was intended.
Also, I know for a fact that the description of the event was the work of one individual and at the outbreak reactions to it many members of the fraternity urged him to take it down and that it didn’t represent the values of the frat or its brothers.
Last mexican I knew about in pi kap was nearly kicked out for rape allegations if I recall correctly. Might want to pick some classier Mexicans.
I think you need to get the entire story straight before you post gossip and slander on a website. You clearly know nothing about what happened.
We have 8 hispanic initiated members in our fraternity which is over ten percent of the entire house. Please refrain from throwing information out there without any actual evidence.
just so insanely false, please check your facts before you slander such an organization
Allegations being the keyword.  Girls falsely accuse guys all the time of that stuff for whatever reason and do not think about whose life they are ruining.  People like you are pathetic.
Did you actually just say that? 
I’m incredibly disappointed in this comment. 
“Girls falsely accuse guys all the time of that stuff for whatever reason and do not think about whose life they are ruining.” 
Excuse me? 
In my freshman year, I was at an unnamed fraternity house, and some guy kept hitting on me. We were both inebriated. I agreed to one kiss, and nothing more. Soon after, he literally picks me up and I’m yelling for him to stop. His fraternity brothers are laughing because they think we’re just joking around. I am not. He takes me to one of the back rooms and tries to force me to have sex with him. He held me down and didn’t stop until I started sobbing, and he freaked out and walked out. 
I was a freshman and didn’t want to say anything. I only told a few close friends. Do you know why? Because people like you (“yea…”) in fraternities seem to think that if a girl accuses a guy for attempting to rape her, she’s ruining his life. 
Oh my bad. He only tried to rape me, no big deal. Excuse me for my ulterior motives. I really was just MAD he wouldn’t date me after trying to rape me. 
The sad thing is, over this anonymous commenting process, you can see the attitudes of a lot of fraternity members. 
I don’t want to generalize, so I won’t judge your whole house on it.
But shame on you. Shame on you for assuming that girls falsely accuse guys for no reason. 
For the record, I didn’t ever accuse this guy. I was too scared his fraternity brothers were going to hound me for “ruining their fun” and their “reputation” – I mean, f*** b****** get money right?
What’s the address and when does it start?  I hope my decidedly non-Latin mustache doesn’t preclude me from a good night of clean fun.
lol
Hi there,
As a member of the fraternity in question, I have never seen racism or racial dominance influence the decisions we make as a fraternity. We have had many themed parties and I honestly feel that none (including this one) were created to inspire hatred of any kind, to perpetuate stereotypes or in a way that is ignorant of preexisting social constructs. As a Spanish-speaker and having lived a significant portion of my life in the country of Spain, I could equally say that this party attempted to mimic the fiestas, and possibly the stereotypes, of the predominately white and Arab Spanish population. Thus, this becomes a question of culture versus race. Rather, we wished to appreciate Spanish, Mexican, and Latin American cultures. Sombreros are not a form of racism but an art, and an appreciation for tequila, margaritas, and coronas is high class and an acquired taste. 
The great sorority sisters of Gamma Phi Beta at USC recently had an “all you can eat” fundraiser for their philanthropy. The theme for the event was Italian. I couldn’t even begin to attack this event as racist against Italians because none of you reading this would take me seriously. Only Italian food was served, and the event probably had some Italian music and maybe even some simple decor. This event and Pi Kappa Phiesta, I feel, are very similar; both were planned with good intent. But nothing is stopping me from pointing out Italy’s low economic postion, show up in a mime costume, and laugh at Italy’s problem with obesity in relation to the “all you can eat” function of the event. While this is outlandish, this is what I feel you have done to our event.
While we have canceled the party in response to this article, I feel we need to rethink how we view race in America. Distinguishing cultural characteristics that may be associated to race, is something that is taboo in our society that attempts to be too politically correct, but how can any reasonable discussion of race and the perpetuation of other cultures in America (which is a good thing) take place if we must be hush hush about the subject?
I also am a little personally upset, because I was going to dress the same way I did for the model UN in sixth grade. I wore a sombrero and a poncho, and I wore them proudly. There was no racism attached, and millions of other hispanic and non-hispanic children wear just the same for their model UNs, their Spanish projects, their world fairs.  
I would like to end with a question. While I feel I have elaborated to my full extent on the racial implication that certain events have, where is the opposition to the outbreak of “thrift store” parties that have exploded on campus. Many greek and non-greek organizations (including businesses such as the 9-0) have held “thrift store” parties that essentially consist of wealthy USC students dressing “down” as the lower class residents of the community that surrounds USC. Everyone participates without thinking about the implications these parties have on the imbalance of class, nor do they even pause to notice the members of the lower class who have to sell their clothing to Goodwill while the students laugh and browse through the “ridiculous” and “disgusting” clothes on the racks. (two words I have heard used to describe the apparel that basically originates from the South Central community).
Please contact me Melissa Morales if you would like to continue this conversation. I think it is wonderful because I have found myself on both sides of this argument of whether it is okay or not okay to notice racial stereotypes. I would like to hear further input from you.
Drew Klopfer
Freshman, Undecided
Drew, 
While I support the opinion’s expressed by Melissa and do not agree with some of the points you brought up, I appreciate your well thought out response. Clearly we will not all agree on these controversial issues but I am glad that you have expressed your thoughts and disagreements in a respectable manner. 
I believe the entire Trojan community can learn from Melissa’s and Drew’s comments. There is nothing wrong with disagreement, but a student should not be personally attacked on appearance and other unrelated characteristics for expressing their concerns.
The theme of “Have a Heart” was not Italian. It was Valentine’s Day. No Italian music was played, and there were desserts from many different cultures served.
Obesity is definitely not a significant problem in Italy. Which just further proves that you are have generalized any image you have in your head of an “Italian” to the entire population of that country. AKA you are racist.
As philanthropy chair of Gamma Phi Beta, I just want to clarify that there was no theme to our “Have a Heart” philanthropy event. Drew, perhaps if you had stopped by to support our cause, you would have been better informed. The purpose of “all you can eat,” which has been a tradition for this particular philanthropy, was not meant to be associated with “Italy’s problem with obesity” whatsoever. The point of “all you can eat” for $5, was my attempt to get as many people to come to our philanthropy as possible, so we could raise as much money as we can to help support USC Troy Camp and the McPherson Foundation, which is founded by one of our sister’s family. In addition, I chose spaghetti as the meal out of consideration for our chef, who has to cook for 300+ guests and spaghetti is convenient and easy to make. It shocks me that you would even label a candid and genuine philanthropy as “racist” based on your own false assumptions, and then compare it to a fraternity party, calling them “very similar.” Assuming that your party was in fact, “planned with good intent,” it is still widely different from the purpose of a philanthropy.
I don’t think you understood what drew was saying in his paragraph about G Phi’s philanthropy. He was saying that anyone can take any small thing & take it to the extreme & be offended by it. He said that just because you served all you can eat spaghetti someone could have viewed it was a mockery of obesity in Italy. Drew prefaces that he wouldn’t attempt to make that argument because it would be so far-fetched & said he was just using it as an example.
Those “thrift store” parties sound pretty tasteless as well.  Or are they just satire to highlight the plight of the poor?
Interesting that the description on the facebook event has since been changed. CLEARLY there were racist remarks.
Hello everyone,
Melissa Morales, I am Mexican. 100% Mexican. And I am liberal…I grew up in San Francisco, the liberal capital of the world. I saw the party on facebook and thought it seemed hilarious. Obviously……OBVIOUSLY…….I doubt people in the phi kappa phi fraternity are racist. Grow a goddamn brain. This phi-esta was not meant to be racist but rather to be fun…..
I’m sure they all despise you now, and for good reason…..I bet their party is seriously going to be messed up now.
From,
An admirer
OBVIOUSLY, obviously someone is racist… “border patrol, pickpockets, those kids selling you chicle gum, [and] Montezuma’s Revenge.” You’re right there party is going to to be seriously messed up now.
To Cole:
Where do you get off on attacking a girl about her appearance!? Her appearance has nothing to do with this article and is not a relevant critique. Next time you write a blatantly slanderous comment please refrain from being a asshole and write something actually worth reading. You go to USC, use that brain of yours.
Guys. You aren’t helping your case. The mature and responsible thing to do would be to stop being defensive and reactionary and to own up to your error. Clearly the party theme was offensive enough to someone that she decided to write about it. I can only imagine how many others thought the same exact thing but held their tongue.
Cole, you can go shave your back now.
As a Mexican-American brother of this fraternity, it is incredible to see this blown so out of proportion. To say that a satirical poke at sombreros and accents is offensive means you don’t have any sense of humor. The party description was meant as an obvious satirization of innocuous elements of Mexican culture and to take offense to it is gross political-correctism. I agree with you that the mention of deportation certainly crossed a line and that’s why it was promptly removed from the description. Otherwise, the rest was just harmless fun that a member of any culture should be able to poke at itself.
This party is not a “racist rager.”  The thing that makes this country (and this city) great is diversity.  Diversity means understanding and celebrating various cultures that are different than your own and accepting that they are equal and that no individual is better or worse because of their ethnic, religious, social, gender, or sexual identity.  The men of this fraternity are celebrating Mexican culture and diversity by paying homage and attempting to corporate various aspects of it into a themed party.  How can a party be themed if it doesn’t include anything characteristic of that which it is trying to mimic?  Take your attempts to make a story out of nothing elsewhere.
How is this a celebration of diversity and culture? You cannot seriously believe that you guys are throwing this party (at which a great majority of you will get inevitably drunk and uncontrollable) in search of a greater understanding of Mexican culture. There are many Hispanic and specifically Mexican groups on campus that does just that with guest speakers and whole-hearted discussions. I am Asian-American, and I tend not to mind too much when individuals like you make cursory Asian jokes and think it’s actually funny or clever, but I did get offended by the Duke incident, especially knowing they were an aggregate of intelligent(?) university students. You might not think so because you are desensitized to it or because you are not of a race constantly made quips at, but that doesn’t mean we’re all like you. What do you want us to do, just “lighten up” and apologize for not being born white? I hope you find your brain in Oz… or at least at your “Mexican Phi-esta”.
no one said they picked fiesta theme to celebrate a culture. It’s just an easy theme because its common & easy for everyone to dress up for.
I’m Mexican( ‘a race constantly made quips at’ )& i dont take offense to jokes. Example: I think Carlos Mencia is funny even though he jokes about Hispanic stereotypes. Chris Rock sells out to black crowds as well. Many people do not take offense to cultural jokes.
I think our difference is that I try to see the best in people’s intentions & you see the worst.
I don’t think their was ill-will towards anyone in the party description & anyone who thinks there was anything but some cliche stereotypical jokes you’d find on comedy central or your local stand up should work on being more light hearted. You may enjoy yourself more when you dont think people are attacking you.
Hi Melissa
I put in a comment earlier… hopefully this isn’t a repeat, don’t wanna spam.
You’re so right that people should be offended by racism.
Great letter.
The hater comments were sadly very predictable.
Fight on! :)

This is ridiculous that you would scrutinize this fraternity like that. Just because a party is Mexican themed does not make it racist. You yourself are putting it in that light. Way to make a fraternity look bad by making all these ridiculous accusations. And yes, I don’t understand why you are saying this because it simply makes no sense
I’m pretty sure you’re taking the issue a little too much to heart. I’m not sure these people actually think less of Mexican or Latino people in general, I think they’re just poking fun at stereotypes. If it was openly a party about racial superiority or clear ultra nationalism or something, I would be a little concerned. But from all accounts I hear it’s not….
This letter is satire, right?  Like no one in their right mind would take offense to a country themed party with a few “racist” comments that are obviously meant to be over the top and provoke a response, right?  What’s next, ban St Patrick’s Day parties because they perpetuates Irish stereotypes?
^^^^^^ THIS
Actually, not really John. Like one of the members of the fraternity itself said, there was a line crossed. Border patrol isn’t evoked for people in Mexico. The pickpockets and [poor] kids selling you gum is preceded by “what not to expect.” You know, as if that’s what these Pi Kappa guys consider a trip to Mexico like. Which obviously suggests these guys don’t need to party, they need to read a book.
“Comments meant to..provoke a response”? Oh, you mean like words?
And with your use of analogy we could also say, “why let men join fraternities, it just perpetuates the stereotype of the dull, druggie, tasteless male.” 
Which oh goodness, we certainly know is not true.
Though let’s have THAT theme party. <–(That's satire.)
I'm kidding. Of course that would be in bad taste. And probably a little boring in my opinion.
So true. I blame the modern era’s need to be politically correct.

After six bloody days in which four people were killed, former Los Angeles Police Department officer and accused murderer Christopher Jordan Dorner’s body burned in a cabin in Big Bear.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
It’s quite difficult to pick just one insane moment from his murderous rampage: Was it his merciless killing of an LAPD officer’s daughter and her fiancee, a USC Dept. of Public Safety officer? Or was it his manifesto sent to several news outlets “explaining” his actions? Perhaps it was the elusive manhunt through the mountains that ended in an epic gunfight?
No, in the ongoing controversy over Dorner, the only thing crazier than his siege on Southern California is the support that he has garnered from citizens in the days since his death. Whatever their reasons for supporting Dorner, the people involved in the pro-Dorner movement need to re-evaluate what is actually irrational support for a murderer.
Dorner claimed that his actions were the result of mistreatment and corruption from within the LAPD, and his supporters have risen behind a man they believe was fighting for his rights.
A Saturday protest in front of LAPD headquarters was organized through a Facebook page named “I support Christopher Jordan Dorner.” Protesters have voiced their opposition toward police misconduct and corruption, as well as the way police went about their search for Dorner that ended in the disgruntled ex-cop’s death. The Facebook page clarifies that it is not about “supporting the killing of innocent people.” This is interesting logic, though, considering the man they were so vocally supporting obviously killed innocent people. Such thinking is similar to someone saying that they support Osama bin Laden because they disagree with U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East or potential corruption in the Bush administration.
Dorner’s lengthy manifesto, aside from making terrorist threats toward L.A. police officers and their families, condemns the LAPD for corruption, racism and police misconduct.  Though his manifesto might have some valid points, there are examples of corruption in nearly every other bureaucratic institution in America. And though the manifesto might shed light on the continued need for systems of oversight to combat such corruption, this should not overshadow the positive things that the LAPD does for this city. Just because there are a few rogue cops does not mean that all police officers are inherently corrupt; most police officers are honorable men and women putting their lives on the line out of a desire to protect civilians as best they can.
Another point that Dorner supporters make is that Dorner’s death resulted from unconstitutional police tactics. Police shot two individuals mistaken for Dorner, for example. Though this is not OK and the officers involved should absolutely be investigated, it does not provide any legitimate foundation for supporting Dorner.
Additionally, a participant in Saturday’s protest said that the police acted as “the judge, the jury and the executioner” in their final standoff with Dorner.
Putting aside the fact that Dorner actually killed himself with one of his many guns, he implicitly waived his right to trial by jury when he shot at the authorities calling for his surrender. Not only had Dorner made terrorist threats and stockpiled military-grade assault weapons, but he shot at police during that siege, wounding one and killing another. There should be no question that had Dorner exited that cabin peacefully, unarmed and with his hands in the air, he would have received his fair trial.
Sure, the circumstances surrounding Dorner’s firing from the LAPD are unclear and might warrant further scrutiny, but nothing — not even an unfair termination of employment — can justify the murders of dedicated public servants and their innocent family members.
Misdirecting their ire toward the people trying to protect them from criminals like Dorner is the wrong route for protesters to take; instead, they should encourage police oversight while also wholly condemning the unjustifiable actions of a cold-blooded killer.
Treating Dorner as a sort of hero is ludicrous and an embarrassing result of the moral relativism that is at the root of so many of society’s ills. Dorner was far from a hero, and he immediately delegitimized himself as a moral or rational individual when he started taking innocent lives. He was just a mentally disturbed, angry ex-cop who acted with evil intent and should be remembered as such.

He at least deserved a trial and not a firing squad if the fire the police started didn’t get him first!
