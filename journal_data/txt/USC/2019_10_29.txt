Students struggling to schedule a therapy session at the Engemann Student Health Center may now be able to use a digital platform to contact a therapist, Undergraduate Student Government Sen. Hailey Robertson said at the Tuesday meeting. She is currently working on providing free access to a therapy app for students. 
Robertson and USG Director of Accessibility Affairs Gwen Howard received an anonymous survey from 110 students who indicated that they were dissatisfied with current mental health services at USC. The survey was administered to incorporate student perspective during the process of expanding mental health coverage. Robertson believes that a telehealth program such as Talkspace would help improve accessibility to counseling and alleviate the shortcomings of the Engemann Student Health Center. 
“We got a lot of good feedback that was just very, very evident that students needed something that was a little bit more accessible and flexible with their schedules and that was a little less stigmatized than actually going in person and getting counseling because that can be intimidating for students,” Robertson said. 
Robertson is collaborating with representatives from Talkspace, who have partnered with other universities such as Williams College, to provide a paid subscription to the service, which includes access to therapists via text or video call.  She has also spoken with USC administrators on the feasibility of implementing Talkspace. The health center is still debating whether to devise its own online counseling program or outsource to another company, Robertson said. 
Robertson also spoke about her work with Sens. Emily Donahue and Sara Khoshniyati on a pilot program that would provide access to free menstrual products for students. 
“The ultimate goal is to have menstrual products available for students and accessible in bathrooms for free,” Robertson said. “So that there’s not a barrier to students attending class or having access to the resources they need, essentially making them just as accessible as condoms are, for example.” 
Sen. Ben Rosenthal discussed his work on the Provost Task Force on University Nomenclature, which was formed in response to a 2018 USG resolution calling for a committee to address concerns regarding the name of the Von KleinSmid Center. The building is named after Rufus Von KleinSmid, a eugenicist and former USC president.
Rosenthal said the task force is still debating how to best approach a possible name change. 
“Our processes essentially have been discussions about what are the concerns and how are we going to evaluate someone’s legacy,” Rosenthal said. 
USG also voted unanimously during the meeting to pass a resolution that would create a working group to work toward authorizing select eateries on USC campuses too be federally subsidized food vendors. Students who are eligible for CalFresh would be granted an Electronic Benefit Transfer debit card to purchase groceries. 
Robertson applauded the intent of the resolution as a current recipient of CalFresh. 
”If we can do anything to help low-income students on campus stretch their money further and so that they don’t have to think about eating, paying rent … then that’s obviously something we should be doing as student government and being supportive of that,” Robertson said.
USG also passed a resolution in support of the Associated Students of the University of Utah Senate, which condemned the victim-blaming language used in its university’s motion to dismiss charges in a lawsuit filed by the parents of a deceased student. The student, Lauren McCluskey, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend despite repeated complaints of domestic abuse to university officials.

Nearly 60 people attended a conversation with CNN president Jeff Zucker at Wallis Annenberg Hall Tuesday. Zucker discussed the inner workings of the news business, his experience leading CNN and his time as the former president and CEO of NBC Universal.
The event was hosted by the Center on Communication Leadership and Policy. 
Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Willow Bay started the conversation by addressing rumors that Zucker would be resigning as president of CNN, especially in light of a tweet made by President Donald Trump earlier in the month on the subject. 
“I’m not resigning. That was actually fake news. So there’s no truth to that,” Zucker said. “There were all kinds of rumors … a couple of years ago that I was going to be fired from CNN. And I didn’t pay attention to those rumors at that time. So I don’t believe these rumors at this time, and I don’t pay attention to them now.”
Aside from social media platforms, CNN is considered the number one source of digital news and information, according to a CNN Digital press release. To compete with social media’s information-sharing capabilities, Zucker has implemented a new system at CNN to focus on the technological and digital aspects of news media right from the hiring stage. 
“We were only about hiring people who were editors and writers and producers. We didn’t hire people who understood technology, who knew how to write code,” Zucker said. “What we’ve been doing over the last two, three years and going forward will be [is hiring] people who understand technology.”
Bay asked about a 2016 interview with Variety when Zucker said he did not consider BuzzFeed and Vice “legitimate news organizations.” 
“I think that part of the back-and-forth that I’ve had with places like Vice and BuzzFeed is that … they’re always hitting up at us and they’re always trying to take shots at CNN, because they want to be mentioned in the same breath with us and they want to play in the big leagues,” Zucker said. “Has Vice and BuzzFeed done some good journalism? Yes. But on the whole, are they big, strong journalistic outlets? I don’t think they are. I think that they want to be, but they don’t have enough of the journalism and they don’t have enough of a business model to back it up.”
Teddy Williams, a sophomore majoring in communication, disagreed with Zucker and said she considers Vice to be a credible news outlet and should not be disregarded due to its non-traditional approaches to news. 
“I really like Vice,” Williams said. “I think it especially creates entertaining ways to convey news to people who don’t take news in the traditional sense like reading newspapers or going online.”
The conversation also touched on the growing threats against journalists, not only in conflict-ridden areas abroad, but in the United States as well — specifically with the Trump administration. 
“What Donald Trump is doing in terms of denigrating media and journalism is incredibly destructive not just here at home, to destroying this institution that the United States is frankly built on, but it’s also giving license to authoritarian leaders around the world to mistreat, ignore, arrest and put in danger journalists around the world,” Zucker said.
Once the floor was open to audience questions, Dan Toomey, a senior majoring in journalism who interned at CNN over the summer, asked Zucker for advice for students interested in pursuing a career in broadcast media even with it’s dwindling prevalence. 
“In terms of broadcast news, and sports, live programming, I think that is going to sustain for the next five, 10 years,” Zucker said. “So if you have dreams of broadcast television news, pursue it and just do a great job. The key thing to being a good journalist is knowing how to how to report a story and telling the story.” 
Morgan Stephens, a senior double-majoring in journalism and political science, asked how CNN attempts to approach objectivity in journalism, especially with public criticism of CNN’s inclination to show liberal and conservative views of an issue. 
“I do think it is important, and I have gotten criticism for having people on our payroll and voices who are Republican voices, pro-Trump voices, and I defend them, and I think it is really important for two reasons. First of all, I don’t want to be MSNBC. MSNBC doesn’t really have any of those voices. I think that’s a mistake,” Zucker said. “Two, I think that if we don’t understand what Trump voters and supporters are saying and thinking … then we wake up the day after an election and are surprised that Donald Trump has been elected.”
”It’s our obligation at CNN to call that out and hold them accountable and correct them, but I think not hearing from them is a disservice,” he added.

Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich called for a more aggressive stance toward China to an audience of nearly 300 at Bovard Auditorium Tuesday. 
During the event, titled “Facing America’s Biggest Threat,” Gingrich spoke on the economic and political relationships between the United States and China. The USC chapter of Young Americans for Freedom hosted Gingrich as part of a tour to promote his new book “Trump vs. China: Facing America’s Biggest Threat.”
“We are in a competition,” Gingrich said. “At the end of which either we will either be doing what the Chinese want or we will be sufficiently strong that the Chinese will avoid fighting with us and avoid trying to put pressure on us because we will be too dangerous.”
He criticized American infrastructure, saying the U.S. is falling behind other nations like Japan because of excessive bureaucracy and regulation. Gingrich said without sufficient infrastructure, such as improved public transport and better education, China would be able to dictate American economic interests.
“We can’t get our act together to build anything,” Gingrich said. “I was recently in Japan, riding around on a bullet train. Then I get on Amtrak the other day. I mean, it’s embarrassing.”
Gingrich argued that the U.S. government should protect domestic companies from Chinese buyout. He cited the NBA’s recent decision to bow to pressure from the Chinese government, saying that it is an early example of China’s economic power. 
Alix Ollivier, a class of 2019 alumnus who attended the event, disagreed with Gingrich and said his rhetoric painted China as a foreign enemy.
“They’re looking to position China as the next Russia,” Ollivier said. “Because the Republican Party has always done best when they have a clear enemy that they can target outside of the country.”
Ava von Wnuk Lipinski, a UCLA student, agreed with Gingrich and said the U.S. should take a harder stance against China.
“Definitely [China is] a threat to America,” Wnuk Lipinski said. “It’s crazy that some liberals in America want to do the same thing that they’re doing in China, in the sense of censorship, in the sense of data collection. There’s literally no privacy there.”
USC YAF holds speaking engagements for notable conservative figures on campuses across the country.
Earlier this year, YAF hosted political commentator Michael Knowles as part of his speaking tour. His talk, entitled “Men Are Not Women and Other Uncomfortable Truths,” prompted students from Trojan Advocates for Political Progress, Queer and Ally Students Assembly and other groups to organize a walkout over transphobic comments Knowles has made. 
TAPP also called for the University to stop recognizing YAF as a registered student organization because it believes the organization has broken University anti-discrimination policies. 
YAF also hosted conservative commentator Ben Shapiro last October, sparking protests outside Bovard Auditorium.
Tuesday’s event faced little opposition. While Kailee Evans, a business administration major and YAF activities chair, said that a few posters advertising the event were torn down, there were no protests leading up to or during the talk. 
“He was our former U.S. Speaker of the House. I don’t think Ben [Shapiro] or Michael Knowles are controversial figures, but a lot of people do,” Evans said. “I don’t think Newt has that same connotation in most people’s eyes.”

Most people know Pete Carroll for being an NCAA and Super Bowl champion with both USC and the Seattle Seahawks — two teams very close to my heart. 
However, not many people know about Rocky Seto, Carroll’s longtime right-hand man and assistant coach. Not only was his journey to becoming one of Carroll’s most important partners unique, but Seto is one of the very few Asian coaches in the history of the NFL. In the 2014 Super Bowl, he was the only coach or player of Asian decent. 
Asians make up a disproportionately small number of the athletes in each of the top four professional sports leagues in America. Compared to the 17.3 million Asians who live in the United States (according to the 2010 census), the number of Asians who play professional sports is miniscule at best.
In the NCAA, for example, just 2.1% of student-athletes are Asian. This is troublesome considering more than 5% of America’s population is Asian. For comparison, African Americans make up 13% of the United States population but 16% of the NCAA.
Why is there so little Asian representation in American sports?
The biggest reason may be simply because not many Asians participate in sports early in life. This was definitely true when I was in high school. Never in my four years did I witness an Asian athlete play basketball or take the football field on Friday nights. 
Most of the Asians in my high school friend group played tennis, including me. I used to always joke that a “typical Asian” was known for being in orchestra and playing tennis. Now, looking back at it, I realize I partially internalized it. 
It wasn’t until college that I realized not all Asians had to fit under a certain athletic stereotype. One of my Asian friends was a four-year varsity member of her high school basketball team; in fact, she was one of the star players, averaging 16 points over her career. That would’ve been almost unheard of at my high school.
She made me think about why there isn’t more Asian representation in the four biggest professional sports in America — football, baseball, basketball and hockey. I believe this is mainly because the majority of Asians don’t devote as much time to sports as people of different ethnicities, but even if this is the case, Asian professional athletes should be more common. 
The major sport with the most Asian players is, of course, baseball. Unlike football, which is really only widely popular in the United States, there are a number of high-quality baseball leagues around the world. 
As a matter of fact, baseball is one of the most popular sports in Japan. Many baseball players in America go to the Nippon Professional Baseball Organization. Yet with many skilled baseball players in Japan, MLB still does not consist of many Asian players.
Nonetheless, there are still Asian players who have made a profound impact on MLB. One, and perhaps the most notable, is Ichiro Suzuki. As a Mariners fan, I had the privilege of watching Ichiro play during his years in Seattle. In 2001, his first year in the Major Leagues, Ichiro won Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player. 
If Ichiro never had the level of success he did, there might not be as many Asian athletes playing in MLB — or other sport leagues, for that matter. The Los Angeles Angels have superstar two-way player Shohei Ohtani, and the Los Angeles Dodgers have pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu, the first player from Korea’s professional baseball league to come to the Major Leagues.
Likewise, in the NBA, Jeremy Lin became a household name when he burst onto the scene in 2011. Unlike Ichiro and Ryu, Lin was born in Southern California. However, when he entered the NBA in 2010 with the Golden State Warriors, Lin became one of the few players of Chinese descent to play in the NBA.
Even though there is not much Asian representation in the world of professional sports, there are still those that can make a significant impact. Whether it’s someone of Ichiro’s Hall of Fame caliber or not, Asians deserve to be equally recognized for their contributions to their respective sports as anyone else.

The Trojans relied on strong performances from wide receivers sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown, senior Michael Pittman Jr. and redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns in their comeback win over Colorado Friday night. 
That group — and more — will need to come out hot again Saturday to take down No. 7 Oregon.
Vaughns is confident in his unit ahead of the matchup against a dominant Ducks defense, which has grabbed a staggering 14 interceptions this season.
“They got to guard us,” Vaughns said after Tuesday’s practice. “I feel as if we do our jobs, we’re going to win.”
WELL-ROUNDED OFFENSE
However, those three weren’t the only ones who figure into USC’s gameplan. Freshmen quarterback Kedon Slovis, running back Kenan Christon and wide receiver Drake London have all responded well after seeing their roles increase. 
Having a true freshman significantly contribute is rare. Having three of them is an anomaly. 
“They’re a special group of guys,” offensive coordinator Graham Harrell said. “Most of the places I’ve been, true freshmen haven’t really played, but here, you get a little more developed and talented kid most of the time … You’re going to have to play with young guys, especially if they give you the best chance to win.”
London set career highs in Boulder with seven receptions for 85 yards. He also made one of the biggest plays of the game in the fourth quarter, hauling in a seam route with his defender draped over him to turn a second-and-20 into a manageable third-and-1. 
“[I was] ecstatic,” London said. “Me and my roommate [Christon] doing what we’ve been saying we wanted to do in the summer, and it’s finally coming true.”
Slovis had high praise for his teammate. 
“He’s a special player,” Slovis said. “Everyone talks about the other three [receivers], but I think that he’s just as good as anyone out here. He’s been great since fall camp … It’s just a matter of him getting more touches in games.”
Christon, who started the game at tailback for the Trojans, finished with 14 carries for 76 yards. He also saved the game on the last drive, falling on the ball after a strip sack of Slovis. The speedy running back has capitalized on his opportunity after injuries to running backs junior Stephen Carr, redshirt junior Vavae Malepeai and redshirt freshman Markese Stepp. 
“I just want to help the team as much as I can,” Christon said. “If that means pass blocking all game, then I’ll do that. I just want us to go as far as we can.”
Of course, there was also Slovis, who continued his outstanding season with a 406-yard and four-touchdown performance, leading the 10-point comeback that included two fourth-quarter touchdown passes and earning Pac-12 Freshman of the Week honors. 
“You see the defense for three quarters, so by that time you should be pretty familiar with what they do,” said Slovis of his clutch gene.
INJURY REPORT
Redshirt senior defensive lineman Christian Rector and freshman cornerback Chris Steele returned to practice Tuesday, but their status for the weekend is unknown. With so many players banged up, it’ll be important to watch the injury list before Saturday’s contest.
HIGH STAKES 
USC, traditionally a recruiting powerhouse, has recently struggled with losing top talent from Southern California to the Ducks. A win could immediately strengthen the Trojans’ Pac-12 title hopes, which Helton said could carry plenty of future implications. 
“When you win Rose Bowls and Pac-12 titles, those are when you sign great players,” Helton said. “If you look at all these great freshmen and sophomores that are playing right now, it’s not a coincidence that they got signed right after that Rose Bowl year and that Pac-12 title.”
At first place in the Pac-12 South by virtue of a tiebreaker over No. 9 Utah, USC needs a win to maintain a hold on the top spot. That win could also set the Trojans and Ducks up for a meeting in the Pac-12 Championship in December.

Imagine you were given $1 billion. If you were to spend $1,000 each day — to buy a new car every month or a new house every year — it would take you 2,740 years to spend every last dollar. If you began spending at the height of the Roman Empire, at that rate you would still have money in your account today. Now, imagine you hadn’t been given $1 billion. If you tried to earn this much money, working a job at the federal minimum wage, it would take you 69,000 years. If you were hired at the start of written history, you would still be flipping burgers in the year 62019. 
A billion dollars is a lot of money — enough that America’s 607 billionaires have drawn the continuous attention of our nation, with just three of them owning more wealth than the bottom half of Americans combined. Considering our massive and continually growing wealth gap, this begs the question: Should the billionaire class exist? 
The answer is tied to the status of millions of Americans who live in poverty: 39.7 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2017. They are unable to afford food without government assistance and have only enough money to survive the week. They live with the knowledge that just one accident or medical emergency could ruin them. And there are the millions who live on the streets, essentially abandoned by our government, save for meal kitchens and often unsafe shelters. Poverty is so endemic in our society that we treat it as a natural occurrence and have little hope of creating a nation in which no one faces financial suffering.  
It should not go unacknowledged that America’s poor subsidizes its rich, meaning that the richest few retain their incredible wealth at the expense of everyday citizens. We see this in tax cuts channeled toward the wealthy, one of which passed in 2017 that ensured that the richest Americans pay lower tax rates than the bottom half of the nation. 
This should be understood as nothing less than a handout to those who don’t need it, but the problem goes much deeper than President Donald Trump’s tax plan: The rich binge on a buffet of legal loopholes that allow them to, say, store the bulk of their wealth in stocks and property to avoid paying high rates on it. 
If the super-rich decide to sell any of their assets — be it a mansion or a superyacht — the capital gains taxes they would pay on any profit is significantly less than that on ordinary income, a loophole which cost the government an estimated $457 billion from 2011 to 2015, according to the The Joint Committee on Taxation. And if the array of easy-cut coupons were not enough, the rich are currently hiding an estimated $21 trillion in offshore shell companies, allowing them to pay nothing whatsoever for their wealth. 
Our system is not top-heavy by accident but by the design of those with undue political influence. If this sounds like a conspiracy theory, consider that there is a supposed billionaire in the Oval Office, one who has repeatedly bragged that paying as little as possible is “the American way.” 
Consider also the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which reinforced the notion that corporations are people and thus allowed to spend without limit on the political candidate who best represents their interests. 
This is all nothing short of disastrous. 
We are stingy on education spending and balk at the cost of universal health care while endorsing the tax cuts and subsidies that allowed Amazon to pay nothing in federal income tax last year. 
As of 2017, there are 40 million hungry Americans and workers fighting for a livable minimum wage while a select few hold more wealth than they could spend in a thousand lifetimes. It doesn’t have to be this way: There is a version of America where the rich pay their fair share — not a communist utopia, but a return to the status quo before several decades-long trends got us to a point of unprecedented wealth inequality. 
My point is not to demonize the rich, and granted, a good deal of America’s wealthiest have done enormous benefit to the economy. They shouldn’t be punished for their success, but neither should they reap the endless rewards of our poorly-weighted system. 
Democratic presidential candidates like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have laid out tax plans to target accumulated wealth instead of just income and to use that revenue to fund programs like healthcare and affordable housing. The hope is that the country’s most fortunate will do more in the assistance of its least — is that really so extreme?

In terms of diversity, USC’s incoming Class of 2023 hit many marks. According to USC News, 27% of incoming freshmen come from traditionally underrepresented groups. In addition, females make up 55% of the incoming class. Despite these developments, the diversity and equity of admissions can always be improved upon, and one of the ways in which USC can do so is by reexamining the culture of feeder schools.
A feeder high school is a school from which an exceptionally high number of students are accepted into a given university. USC’s top feeder high schools this year were Foshay Learning Center, Canyon Crest Academy, Loyola High School, Arcadia High School and La Cañada High School, all based in Southern California. 
Students from these schools make up around 3% of incoming freshmen, which, to put it into perspective, is half the percentage of incoming Black students. Though it makes sense that a school that is close both geographically and professionally with USC — Foshay, whose demographics include 82% Latinx students and 17% Black students has a college preparation program that was created in direct partnership with the University — would have a higher matriculation rate to the University, feeder schools may be limiting the diversity of the incoming freshman population.
La Cañada, Canyon Crest and Loyola all have fairly typical racial breakdowns, with white students making up around half of the student body. This parallels USC’s own student population, where white students also make up the largest race group at 32%. 
At Foshay, white students make up only 0.32% of the total student body, while underrepresented groups, including Latinx students at 83.7% and Black students at 15.11%, make up the remaining majority. Arcadia also sets itself apart, with Asian students making up the majority at 65.2% while white students are at 13.4% and other underrepresented groups, such as Black students are at 2.3% and Latinx students at 14.1%, fall behind comparatively. These two schools show how feeder schools can be used to expand the diversity of the University rather than curtail it.
Because most feeder schools emerge in primarily affluent communities, students from middle- and lower-class communities may also not have as much representation. For example, La Cañada Flintridge, where La Cañada High School is, placed 64th on Bloomberg’s 2017 list of most affluent cities in the United States.
In addition, while four of the five top feeder schools to USC are public schools, many of the feeder schools to top institutions such as Harvard University are private. This further widens the gap between lower- or middle-class students and upper-class students in terms of access to a quality college-preparatory education.
Feeder schools often provide the advantage of having teachers, administrators and alumni who are well-equipped with the information and resources needed to send their students to competitive colleges. The fact that they are able to send a high number of students to top colleges consistently each year means that they have learned the game of college admissions and have become seasoned players.
Not only do feeder schools give students an advantage when applying to elite colleges, they also give students a greater opportunity to succeed once accepted. 
USC is taking clear strides to welcome an increasingly diverse incoming freshman class each year, and this is evident in the makeup of the Class of 2023. 
The University cannot abolish feeder schools, nor can it ignore the academic excellence that students from its top feeder schools display. However, to keep diversity on an upturn, USC should consider the advantages that these students are given over other students in the admission process.

Stuck between ordering Fashion Nova’s sexy Buzz Lightyear or a cheap witch costume from Amazon for Halloween? Here’s an idea — close both tabs, and save yourself the money and stress about whether or not it will ship on time. You’ll be doing the planet a big favor.
In 2014, the National Retail Federation conducted a study that found more than two-thirds of celebrants will buy a costume for Halloween each year. Total spooky spending for that year by Americans? More than 7 billion dollars. And with big spending comes big waste. 
It’s no secret that the garment and textile industry has catastrophic effects on the environment. Capitalism and global warming are deeply connected, and if you’ve seen the 2015 documentary “The True Cost,” you know fast fashion is a leading cause of river pollution, structural poverty and oppression. Unsurprisingly, the demand for Halloween costumes only adds fuel to this fire. 
According to the environmental charity Hubbub UK, 82.5% of the materials found in Halloween costumes are plastic. When we consider how many costumes are thrown away after a single use, it is estimated that the annual plastic waste generated from the industry will be equivalent to about 83 million water bottles. 
So what can you do? It’s the day before Halloween, and you feel like you have no options besides hitting up Target’s makeshift costume section. Luckily for you, I’m here to give you a few last-minute ideas that won’t burn the ozone or your bank account.
First, my favorite places to shop for costumes are thrift stores. You never know what you’re going to find — a large faux fur jacket may inspire an animal costume, or you could get lucky and snag a crazy ‘80s windbreaker and pretend like you’ve just walked off the set of Olivia Newton-John’s “Physical.” 
A couple weeks ago, I found a beautiful red blazer from Jet Rag on La Brea Boulevard for only a dollar, which I incorporated into a devil costume (it was definitely hot). Some Goodwills even carry the same costumes as your local Party City does, for only at a fraction of the price and with a bit of secondhand love. 
Not only is thrifting super sustainable, but it’s also perfect for any college student on a budget. The Goodwill on Figueroa Street is pretty good, but if you can make the drive, Santa Monica has some amazing secondhand stores.
You could also repurpose something you already own. Do you own a striped shirt and black jeans? Cut an eye mask out of something black and be a burglar! Monochrome outfits are also wonderful starting points for costumes — my little sister had a purple sequin dress in her closet, and with the help of some fake leaves from potted plants around the house, I became a sexy grape. 
I also own a ridiculous amount of pink, so tomorrow I’ll be Barbie. There’s really no limit to your imagination here. 
If you’re into makeup or you obsessively watch beauty tutorials on YouTube, Halloween is your time to shine. 
Skulls, ghosts and clown makeup can be as understated or elaborate as you want them to be (side note: with all the clown memes that were spread this year, I feel like this is actually the perfect costume for 2019). You don’t even have to be objectively good at makeup to use this classic last minute trick. Put purple and red eyeshadow all over your face with some fake blood and be a corpse. Even lazier? I drew a red line at the corner of my friend’s mouth so he could be a vampire. Instagram was key for inspiration with this one. 
If you must go out and buy something, make sure you’ll be able to rewear it in the future or donate it to someone who won’t throw it in the trash after one use.
There’s nothing spookier than global warming, so please think before you buy! Now that’s hot.

Panteha Abareshi, a junior majoring in fine arts is currently showcasing their latest body of work, HIPAA VIOLATION. Their exhibition explores the nuances of existing in a chronically ill body and the implications of embracing and embodying one’s own mortality through a series of video, installation, performance and sculptural work. 
Abareshi lives with sickle cell beta thalassemia, a disorder that has caused them to spend a significant amount of their life in medical care. Art was initially a coping mechanism for Abareshi but quickly became their passion.
Abareshi has been working on this project for a year now, which they received funding for last spring through the Farber Award, a grant for artists. HIPAA VIOLATION is the first time Abareshi has showcased media different than their two-dimensional work, but the challenge has proven beneficial for them.
“This has been an opportunity to expand on work that [they’re] doing in film, video and in sculpture and installation,” said Jennifer West, an associate professor at the Roski School of Art and Design who is both Abareshi’s mentor and professor. 
The exhibition is an interactive space that invites viewers to step out of their own bodies and to enter Abareshi’s spaces.
“It’s going to be an interactive space because there is like stairs that people are going to be climbing just to sort of discuss ability and inability and accessibility and all of that,” Abareshi said. 
Featuring their medical records and various medical sculptural ephemera, the exhibit further encourages viewers to directly engage with the artist’s experience. 
“My work is very much so just me communicating my experience, and my experience isn’t one that’s accessible to a lot of people,” Abareshi said. “It’s also very unique to me, as everyone’s experience is, but disability and its intersections with gender and race and mental illness and all of that isn’t discussed or really ever put on open exhibition.” 
Abareshi explained that their approach has never been to change someone’s mind or provide a single concrete message. Instead, they simply aim to tell their story by using vulnerability to relate to audiences’ own experiences. 
“The things that I’m talking about — like fear and weakness and vulnerability — all of these things aren’t limited to the experience of someone with an illness,” Abareshi said.
Their art encourages people to step out of their comfort zones to find the commonalities between their stories and those of others. 
“Everyone experiences these things,” Abareshi said. “Everyone can be terrified and broken down and anxious and all of these things, but it’s like framing it in this way also communicates to people who never have experienced anything that I have … We all are going through this, but this is my very specific experience of that, and putting that on display.” 
Lucy Allen, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies and a friend of Abareshi, said this exhibit is particularly special in how it provides a visual representation of Abareshi’s experiences. 
“It’s always just cool to see a friend who’s an artist bring to life and bring into the physical world the concepts and thoughts that you’ve heard them express and that you know are important to them,” Allen said. 
HIPAA VIOLATION is set up inside the Helen Lindhurst Gallery at Roski, a space dedicated to providing student artists a place to explore their ideas through art. Abareshi’s work is a testament to the power of the space, as their work completely transforms the gallery to simulate being in a hospital. 
“What’s been really significant is [them] having a full solo exhibition in a space that [they] could take over and transform into what is an environment very similar to the mechanisms around a hospital,” West said.
Abareshi’s work is ultimately an exploration of the artist’s own configurations within their body, within medical systems and within society. But it’s also meant to stress empathy in everyone.
West emphasized the importance of Abareshi’s highly personal work connecting with a wide audience.
“[Abareshi has] dealt with these institutions very personally with [their] own body and [their] own mind, and so that would be of interest to the larger University and to the public in general,” West said.

The NCAA’s top governing board voted unanimously Tuesday to start the process to allow college athletes to profit from the use of their name, image and likeness. The move comes nearly a month after California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law the Fair Play to Pay Act, which prompted a number of other states to move toward adopting similar legislation.
According to a press release from the NCAA, the move directs each of the organization’s three divisions to update its bylaws in a way that allows student-athletes to be compensated “in a manner consistent with the collegiate model” by January 2021, stating that paying athletes directly for athletic performance is still entirely impermissible.
“We must embrace change to provide the best possible experience for college athletes,” said Dr. Michael Drake, president of The Ohio State University and chair of the NCAA Board of Governors, in the press release. “Additional flexibility in this area can and must continue to support college sports as a part of higher education.”
USC issued a statement Tuesday about the NCAA’s vote.
“The NCAA decision today is a step forward toward achieving a national framework for these critical issues,” the statement read. “We plan to work with California officials, the NCAA, the Pac-12 Conference and others to help develop reforms that support our student-athletes and allow them to continue to compete and excel.”
The NCAA’s statement clarifies that student-athletes are in no way employees of their respective universities and that the new rules should treat student-athletes similarly to non-athlete students. 
“As a national governing body, the NCAA is uniquely positioned to modify its rules to ensure fairness and a level playing field for student-athletes,” NCAA President Mark Emmert said in the press release. “The board’s action today creates a path to enhance opportunities for student-athletes while ensuring they compete against students and not professionals.”
The NCAA Board of Governors Federal and State Legislation Working Group provided recommendations to the NCAA’s top governing board, which helped guide their actions. 
The working group had been in communication for the past several months with administrators, commissioners, coaches and student-athletes across all three NCAA divisions. 
The group will continue to inform the Board of Governors about how to respond to state and federal legislation pushing for increased opportunities for student-athletes to earn compensation.
This article was updated at 7:39 p.m. Tuesday to include USC’s statement.

The notion that wine can be canned and easily accessible like Coors Light might make some self-anointed wine experts’ noses wrinkle, but I, for one, think canned wine is one of the greatest innovations in the wine world. 
It comes as no surprise that Australia, a country in the New World — meaning winemaking began there after the 15th century as opposed to in Europe, the Old World, where winemaking has been going on forever — had the first winery to offer canned wine in 2003. I mean, a country that can produce wines named Monsters, Monsters, Attack! and 19 Crimes is not going to be afraid to revolutionize winemaking and wine-drinking.
Accessibility 
Canned wines tackle the two barriers that keep most college students from drinking wine: costliness and formality. For the most part, canned wines are as affordable as beer and definitely cheaper than most bottled wines at the supermarket. The debate surrounding wine versus beer on the issue of cost and affordability should be less difficult with the introduction of this new form of drinking wine. Wine in a can removes the snobbery that is historically associated with wine. You can literally bring it to a tailgate, backyard barbecue, the swimming pool or a picnic with the casualness that you would bring any other beverage. You certainly don’t need a wine bottle opener, that’s for sure! 
Aesthetics
Whether you’re an influencer or seeking to maintain a certain vibe in your life, canned wines can help you on your journey. Canned wines, with their cylinder shapes, fit easily in your palm. With unique branding, will look better in any post on your Instagram or Snapchat than a red Solo cup ever would — not to mention the possibilities for those artful table designs at one of your upcoming holiday parties or birthday celebrations. Canned wines, such as Babe Rose with Bubbles ($10.99/TotalWine.com) and millennial wine brands like Nomadica, are being introduced to the market on a yearly basis so be sure to do some research. 
Sustainability
Important things to consider are our drinking habits and their environmental impacts. While this is a fairly new conversation within the wine world, canned wines show promising results in comparison to bottled wine in terms of recyclability and shipping. Recyclability of aluminum cans is more straightforward than that of glass bottles and can even boast a faster turnaround rate from the recycling center back onto the store shelves. 
When the vast majority of wine drinkers in the United States are drinking purely for consumption and not collection, the bottling of wine loses much of its intended purpose, and the transition to cans makes so much sense. You can also transport a larger quantity of canned wines than bottled wines in a single truck, so we’ll be cutting down on carbon emissions too!         
At the end of the day, canned wines can be a great alternative to bottled wines and beers. The benefits outweigh the negativity from the snobs that keeps people from drinking canned wines. But as the saying goes, haters are going to hate. So hit up your local liquor store or supermarket, and cheers to a can of wine!

The USC Trojan Council, comprises the presidents and vice presidents of the Undergraduate and Graduate Student governments, Academic Senate and Staff Assembly, held its second University Forum Monday evening. While the Trojan Council is recognized by some member organizations such as USG, GSG and Staff Assembly, it still lacks formal external recognition from the University.
“With regards to the Trojan Council, we’ve existed for a while, but we’ve kickstarted what we’ve been doing as an organization in the past two semesters,” USG Vice President Mahin Tahsin said. “I think there’s a lot of work we can do, what kind of collaborative force we can bring and what kind of issues we can really highlight for our University.” 
The forum, held once a semester, invites students, staff and faculty to openly discuss ideas, suggestions and concerns with University leadership. The event took place at the Tutor Campus Center on the University Park Campus and was live broadcasted to the Health Sciences Campus. 
Members of the new senior administration, including President Carol Folt, Provost Charles Zukowski and Senior Vice President for Human Resources Felicia Washington, were in attendance at the forum.
“This was our second-ever University Forum that we know of and I think it went incredibly well, particularly because it’s the first time where I think we brought together the larger USC community since a lot of administrative change,” USG President Trenton Stone said. “It was a good opportunity to have them in the room and hear from members of the Trojan Family that they probably have not met before. I think that’s really encouraging that [the senior administration] really [does] want this feedback and they really are trying to look at how to improve the University, especially those that are new in their role.”
The presidents of each body moderated the conversation revolving around four topics: communication, interconnectivity across campuses, community wellness and sustainability before the floor was opened to concerns related to all issues. 
Ideas ranged from streamlining the communication of safety and DPS reports to increase the availability of resources for students of color, to the University’s lack of preparedness for natural disasters. 
The forum allowed community members to express issues of personal relevance to them, especially regarding the university’s support in alleviating the cost of living for students, faculty and staff. Concerns about food insecurity, homelessness and the clear economic disparity between students were discussed during the event. 
“I guess your own personal experiences, a lot of times, dictates what you want to be brought up, so I was really happy with the low-income voice that was brought up and the attention to needing food accessibility, because as a low-income student, that’s something that is super vital,” said Correy McGlynn, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies.
“I really appreciated the personal stories that were shared to give a grounded aspect to the problems that students, staff, faculty, everyone across the University is facing, as well as the range of tangibility of projects,” said Truman Fritz, USG Senior Director of Communications. 
However, the forum’s format as a listening session resulted in a desire from attendees to engage in direct dialogue and discussion with senior leadership. 
“There were promises of ‘We’re going to listen, and also take action on this,’ and that’s up to them to do. We’ll be the judges of that in the coming months,” said Nathan Delgado, a senior majoring in economics. 
The Council’s next steps after their formal recognition are to better facilitate this engagement. 
“I definitely think there’s room for improvement to be able to have more direct engagement, and I think our priority will be trying to figure out how to move forward with that and encourage those around us to participate in those types of engaging dialogue,” Stone said.
Yet, some leaders believed that the Forum represented a move toward more collective efforts to fixing university issues. 
“I think the Trojan Council as a whole can really bring that force, and bring the entire constituency of USC together to push forward the needs that students, faculty and staff all have,” Tahsin said.

Strong Santa Ana winds brought raging fires to Los Angeles this past weekend. As the Getty, Saddleridge and Tick fires continue to burn throughout the city, causing thousands to evacuate, the USC community has felt the impacts of the devastation.
The fires have resulted in the closure of several major freeways in L.A, including the 405 Freeway near the Getty Center, where a brush fire continues to burn through more than 600 acres with 5% containment at time of publication. Dozens of schools and universities in the city are closed until further notice due to hazardous air quality and their proximity to the fires. 
Students at Mount Saint Mary’s University evacuated their Brentwood campus. Local colleges such as Santa Monica College and UCLA canceled classes Monday. 
While USC is not in close proximity to any of the fires devastating L.A., students, faculty and staff from the surrounding area have felt its effects. Monday Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Dean Amber Miller told students in an email expressing her support for students affected by the fires that she and her family were awakened by smoke and had to evacuate their home early that morning. 
“We were lucky enough to have family in the area, so we had a place to go, and our family is safe,” Miller wrote. “Many in our USC Dornsife community affected by the Getty Fire may not be as lucky as we are. If you are in need of help, please know that your USC Dornsife family has your back, and we fully support whatever measures you need to take to keep yourself and your loved ones safe.”
A similar email of support was sent from Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Willow Bay Monday and Price School of Public Policy Dean Jack Knott.
Emails from deans also listed services offered by USC to those affected by the fires or looking for a place to stay after evacuating their homes, such as Campus Support & Intervention, Trojans Care 4 Trojans and various counseling services.
“Safety is our foremost concern, so please coordinate with your department or unit to discuss class cancellations or allow for working remotely if need be,” Miller wrote. 
While fires in California are common, the power outages this year have worsened the situation for families in affected areas. Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric have been shutting off power for thousands of residents across California in an effort to prevent fires. However, these companies have failed to inform residents of planned blackouts and have sparked controversial backlash from those concerned with a lack of power in disaster areas.
“I don’t think I’ve ever really had like to experience power outages,” said Florence Yang, a sophomore majoring in computer science. “I don’t know what people are supposed to do back at home because if you go inside, there’s no power there, but if you go outside, the air is bad.” 
She mentions how her family had to cancel a trip to Napa Valley in November due to the raging wildfires and wonders why PG&E has to cut off the power supply. The Kincade Fire in Sonoma County has spread to more than 74,000 acres and was only 15% contained at time of publication.
“I just think I want to understand better why PG&E must shut down power due to these fires because they’ve gotten into a lot of trouble for being the instigator of these fires,” Yang said. “If anything its causing more inconvenience and problems … but also the fires are still happening.”
Melody Yao, a sophomore majoring in economics-mathematics, said while she is not directly affected by the fire, she remembers her high school in Northern California canceling classes for several days due to previous fires. 
She believes that USC should take several actions to ensure that students are safe, including providing free masks at the health center and issuing periodic updates about the fire to help students stay up-to-date. 
Audra Magness, a sophomore majoring in theatre, went to Fresno over the weekend and saw a lot of the smoke while returning to L.A. Sunday. She said her hometown is affected by fires every year and has dealt with poor air quality. 
 “I am from the Central Valley [and] we get a lot of the debris from the fires whether they are happening up north or down south,” said Audra Magness, a sophomore majoring in theatre. “Just this weekend, I was traveling from Fresno back to Los Angeles and the entire grapevine was so bogged down by smoke.”
According to the Times, the Getty and Kincade fires have smoke advisory warnings that have been issued in affected areas and “very unhealthy” air quality is widespread — from Northern California to the San Fernando Valley.
Magness says she is more worried now that the fires have reached L.A. and hopes that they will be able to control it before it begins to affect urban parts of the city. 
“I think it’s pretty scary that it’s reaching L.A. proper because normally it’s contained or farther away from the center of the city,” Magness said. “Now that it’s … [close to] UCLA, I feel like they will get it under control but [in] the city, everything is so close together — as soon as one thing catches fire, I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of other things, in turn, set ablaze and it’s a big tragedy if that happens.”
However, UCLA cancelled classes in 2017 after poor air quality resulting from similar fires caused concerns among the university community.

When Jameela Jamil took over as the first solo female host of the BBC’s The Official Chart, she said she helped grow the show’s following by 300,000 listeners in her first few months. However, the British instead covered her weight gain and published unflattering photos of her instead. 
“It was stressful and upsetting, and I decided to take it to Parliament and spoke in front of the government and became a full-time advocate within the body positivity movement because I was receiving death threats over my weight,” she said.
Jamil, who now stars as Tahani Al-Jamil on “The Good Place,” spoke to an audience of nearly 500 people in Bovard Auditorium Monday on her body neutrality movement, intersectional activism and her experience working as a woman of color in the entertainment industry. The Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment hosted the actor and activist to close out its programming for Body Love Month, which featured speakers like comedian Nicole Byer. Stacy Smith, director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, moderated the discussion. 
During the event, Jamil told the audience she was deaf until she was 12 years old and later developed an eating disorder. She dealt with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts throughout her 20s, after being hit by a car around the time she was 18. 
Jamil said she hopes to use her privilege and platform as an actor to bring attention to mental health as well as other issues related to lack of representation in media and disability rights.
“That horrifying experience of being me for at least 27 or 28 years of my life has made me determined to stop as many other people as I can from feeling the way that I did,” Jamil said. “I only ever got into show business to be able to find a way to talk to as many people as possible about how to avoid fucking up as badly as I have.”
When “The Good Place” production team made Jamil create an Instagram to help promote the show, she noticed posts about female stars’ weight and ads for different weight loss supplements. These posts led Jamil to tweet about various aspects of her life and career that she valued, including her financial independence, activism and the struggles she had overcome. 
Jamil said thousands of women wrote back to her that day with lists of traits they value in themselves, and people continue to send her posts every day. She then created the “I Weigh” Instragram movement, which now has more than 900,000 followers on Instagram and helped compel Facebook and Instagram to ban certain weight loss product ads.
Jamil plans to expand I Weigh into a company next year and has hired an all-female staff to work on curriculum for schools to educate parents, teachers and children on what they’re seeing online and to work with governments around the world to change advertising standards. 
Olivia Velasquez, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said she hopes to work in entertainment and enjoyed hearing from an actor who uses her platform to promote social change. 
“I thought it was inspiring to see an artist who is doing this out of the goodness of their heart and because they want to see change in the world and that is part of the reason why I want to pursue theater,” she said. “I think how honest she is about being so fed up with the current social climate … I thought was really inspiring.”
Jamil, who has a chronic disorder known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that causes overly-flexible joints and stretchy, fragile skin, also pushes for more representation for people with disabilities. 
Jamil said she turned down a role as a deaf woman earlier this year because she felt it belonged to a disabled person, even though she had been deaf previously. While some actors argue that they should be allowed to play these roles like any other character, Jamil said until more roles are written for and offered to underrepresented groups, actors from more privileged spaces need to give them up.
Seeret Singh, a freshman majoring in theatre, said Jamil’s talk encouraged her to pursue a career in entertainment and push for better representation in the industry. 
“I recently entered the industry, and Jameela Jamil being a South Asian woman who is also an actor and an activist is a huge inspiration to me,” she said. “Being able to hear her talk about the things that she’s passionate about and be the exact same way that she comes off on her platforms was cool.”

Ahead of his talk at Bovard Auditorium Tuesday, former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich spoke to the Daily Trojan about the rise of China, the 2020 election and the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Young Americans for Freedom, a conservative campus organization, will host the former representative and current presidential adviser for a discussion on his new book “Trump vs. China: Facing America’s Greatest Threat.” 
“The core of my initial presentation [in Bovard] will be about the nature of China and the degree to which we have misunderstood [China] and the need for us to really reassess how we are going to deal with a competitor of this scale,” Gingrich said. 
His new book, which was released Oct. 22, details that America’s greatest competitor is China and that the American system is being challenged by the Chinese system. Gingrich said the U.S. is currently facing two challenges with China — a domestic problem and an international problem.
“We have to recognize that China’s operating on a worldwide basis … and it is very different than what we are used to dealing with,” Gingrich said. “And the Chinese are doing a brilliant job of using free enterprise, the Belt and Road Initiative and Huawei 5G to network together countries all over the place in a way we currently are not close to matching.”
YAF Chairman Maxwell Brandon said he hopes students learn about the real issues facing the country, such as the trade war between China and the U.S.
“China is big in the news right now with the trade war going on, the theft of intellectual property, and it’s something I think is really relevant,” Brandon said. “Hopefully [students] can begin to solidify an opinion on China.”
Though Gingrich has made frequent appearances on television networks in an effort to promote his new book, he has also been a prominent voice related to the current impeachment inquiry. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House will vote on the impeachment inquiry into Trump Thursday, and Gingrich, a vocal supporter of the president, is against the decision. 
“The most accurate way to think of this is that this is a sore loser impeachment,” Gingrich said. “It isn’t about anything that Trump has done. It is about the fact that Trump exists, and 70% of people who favor impeachment favored impeachment the morning after the election.”  
The Daily Trojan could not independently confirm these statistics. 
As house speaker during the late 1990s, Gingrich led the impeachment against former President Bill Clinton. Just months after Clinton’s impeachment, which was determined on a party-line vote, Gingrich resigned from his position after revelations of an extramarital affair with a younger congressional employee garnered attention. 
When asked about the difference between the impeachment proceedings against Clinton and the current inquiry into Trump, Gingrich did not directly answer the question in detail and instead reiterated that the current investigation lacks due process and fails to be bipartisan.
“[The] investigation … violates the right of due process defined in the Bill of Rights and is done in secret by harsh partisans who clearly are bitterly determined to take out Trump,” Gingrich said. “It is an embarrassment. The fact is that you and I have no idea if they have discovered anything because everything is done in secret.”
Gingrich believes that under his leadership during Clinton’s impeachment, he approached the issue with a more bipartisan and transparent approach.
“They don’t let the Republicans have subpoena power, and they don’t let the White House council sit in the room,” Gingrich said. “This whole thing is being done as a hatchet job.”
While Gingrich is staunchly opposed to impeachment, recent FiveThirtyEight polls suggest that 83.3% of Democrats and 47.5% of independents support impeachment. Among Gingrich’s Republican party, only 11.4% of Republicans support impeachment. 
Gingrich also discussed the 2020 election and the upcoming Iowa caucus in February, the first nominating contest of the Democratic presidential primaries. 
“The most interesting thing about next year’s election is going to be whether or not people actually want to follow policies that so clearly don’t work,” Gingrich said. “My personal guess is that [former Vice President Joe] Biden is in trouble — he can’t raise money, and he is also goofy.”
Gingrich predicts that if Biden cannot gain enough support in 2020, Sen. Elizabeth Warren could potentially pose a threat to Trump in the fall.
“Anybody poses a legitimate threat until you beat him, but I think it would be very foolish to think that she’s not [a threat],” Gingrich said. “If you look at the range of her ideas, she would represent such a radical defining of America.”
Gingrich also discussed California politics and was critical of the state’s policymakers, especially regarding the recent wildfires raging across Northern and Southern California. 
“The politics of Sacramento have led to the kind of investment strategies so that PG&E has not put its money into modernizing its lines,” Gingrich said. “We have a power company in America so incompetent that its only solution is to quit being a power company … To turn off electricity to 2 million people, they basically give up being a power company.”
Gingrich will discuss these topics in detail during his talk Tuesday and looks forward to fielding questions from the audience.
“We will toss [the event] open to questions and let the students direct it,” Gingrich said.
