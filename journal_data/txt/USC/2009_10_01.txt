Seeking a long-term solution to The Row’s continual safety and traffic problems, Greek senators are resurrecting a USG proposal to close 28th Street to traffic.
The project has been discussed before, but now USG is taking steps to assess interest and has already started surveying students about the possibility of a full or partial closure of 28th Street. The senators have also created a Facebook group, “USG 28th Street Development,” to better communicate with students and address individual concerns.
Any proposed changes, however, would have to be approved by the city and garner strong support from USC administrators, likely after a study of its viability.
“It poses a lot of great things for the Greek community and the 28th street neighborhoods,” said USG Greek Senator Max Ukropina.
The primary motivation behind the project is to improve the safety, beauty and utility of The Row, Ukropina said. The senators are considering a proposal for a gate system or a guarded kiosk entrance, which would allow access only to the Department of Public Safety, Campus Cruiser and emergency vehicles.
Implementing any changes on 28th Street would have to be spearheaded by the USC administration. Officials first must decide whether a closure fits with the university’s overall goals for its campus and the surrounding areas. Then, USC would bring a funding proposal to the city, where it would go through a lengthy permit process. A number of Greek and parents’ associations would also be consulted.
According to Ukropina, this process could easily take up to eight years before the actual change would happen.
The idea of blocking off one or both sides of The Row is not a new one, according to USG President Holden Slusher, but it has always only been worked on in conjunction with other plans.
“It was an idea before, but now it’s an actual project that’s being worked on,” Slusher said. “Although it’s very popular on The Row, there are so many coordinating councils that need to discuss it … It has never been pushed to the point where it’s handed off to alumni or parent groups to get their support.”
DPS Chief Carey Drayton, who has met with the Greek senators to consider the idea, said they are still in the process of discussing and evaluating various plans to boost safety around campus with both the administration and the surrounding neighborhood associations.
“We are looking at ways to improve safety and security in our community, but that involves lots of different ideas,” Drayton said.
According to Ukropina and fellow Greek Senator Dylan Dann, 28th Street is exposed to a great deal of traffic.
Ukropina said he believed blocking off one or both sides of The Row would decrease traffic congestion, improve safety for bikers and pedestrians, add to the overall aesthetic quality of the street and dissuade thefts and violence.
However, some students said they doubt that blocking off The Row would accomplish the senators’ goals of improving safety.
Timothy Sattler, a junior majoring in public policy, management and planning, said both the Greek community and the senators should provide students with more information about the utility of the project before moving forward with any plans.
“I actually don’t see how it would make The Row that much safer,” Sattler said. “There would still be easy access to The Row even if there wouldn’t be direct access to Hoover.”
Sattler said he was skeptical about the usefulness of a gate or blockade on either side of The Row, and added that the cost and feasibility of such a project should also be considered.
Laura Redfern, vice president of communications for the Panhellenic Council, said they had concerns regarding the logistics of parking and movement in and out of The Row if a blockade was built.
“Girls are concerned about parking … It is already so scarce on The Row,” Redfern said. “[The] Greek senators reassured us that they wouldn’t just close down The Row and do nothing about [parking].”
Despite those concerns, Redfern said Panhellenic agreed that any sort of blockade would improve The Row’s safety.
“I think it would definitely improve the safety of not just the row but [of] the entire university,” Redfern said. “We’ll definitely be a part of the discussion when the time comes.”
Hamada said IFC would be willing to consider the plan if the discussion became more concrete and the senators were able to provide them with their research and all possible options.

The No. 13 USC women’s volleyball team (12-2, 1-1) is looking to continue its solid Pac-10 Conference play this weekend in home matches against No. 9 Cal (8-3, 1-0) on Friday and No. 11 Stanford (7-4, 0-1) on Saturday.
After a weekend of career-highs for sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter (31 kills and 20 digs against Arizona State) and sophomore Kendall Bateman (60 assists), as well as season-highs for senior libero Alli Hillgren (24 digs) and senior All-American outside hitter Jessica Gysin (19 kills and 19 digs), USC is ready to regain its composure from a one-match loss last weekend and come out with wins this time around.

The Women of Troy begin the weekend tonight against Cal at 7 p.m., after their five-set win over Stanford on Saturday. The Golden Bears are hitting .258 this season thus far, with a 13.28 kills per set and a 2.64 blocks per set average.
USC has lead the series against Cal by a 43-9 margin thus far, winning six of the last seven meetings, but Cal is coming to the match ready for a battle. Armed with senior outside hitter Hana Cutura, the leader in kills and points in the Pac-10 — with 209 kills (4.86 kps), hitting .298 with 87 digs (2.02 dps) and 231.5 points (5.38 pps) — and Carli Lloyd, the fourth among Pac-10 players with a 10.47 aps average, the Golden Bears are not looking to lose.
After tonight’s match, the Women of Troy will take on Stanford on Saturday evening, also at 7 p.m. Stanford is coming back from a five-set loss to Cal last weekend and hitting .287 as a team; the third-highest team average in the conference.
The Cardinal have some strong defensive teammates coming to play this weekend as well. Senior middle blocker Janet Okogbaa, the third in the Pac-10, with a 1.32 blocks per set average, and junior outside hitter and setter Cassidy Lichtman with her 136 kills (3.32 kps),  .328 hitting average with 144 assists (3.51 aps), and 92 digs (2.24 dps), held their own against the Golden Bears, but Stanford could not follow through with a win.

Elyn Saks has a long list of accomplishments.
The professor and associate dean at the Gould School of Law was valedictorian at Vanderbilt University, has a master in letters from the University of Oxford, published four books and earned her J.D. from Yale University, where she edited the Yale Law Review.
Genius · USC professor Elyn Saks, schizophrenic herself, will use her MacArthur grant to write a book featuring others with schizophrenia. - Vicki Yang | Daily Trojan
Most recently, Saks was named one of 24 fellows by the MacArthur Foundation, which awards recipients $500,000 to pursue their own creative, intellectual and professional goals. She is the first USC faculty member to be recognized by the organization.
She also has schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia, a mental illness that varies in severity from person to person, is typically characterized by hallucinations and delusions. Those affected by it often have difficulty functioning in day-to-day life.
Saks began to show signs of the illness while she was a student at Oxford, but it was not until she was at Yale — and hospitalized for the third time — that she was diagnosed.
“I was devastated,” she said.
A psychiatrist told her she should take a year off from school to find a less stressful occupation, suggesting the overachieving Saks take a job as a cashier.
“It’s like a sentence to a bleak and painful life,” she said. “People said, ‘Lower your expectations,’ and so on, and I just didn’t.”
Saks went on to complete her studies at Yale and enter the professional world, working as an attorney in Connecticut and teaching at the University of Bridgeport School of Law before coming to USC in 1989.
Here, her colleagues said, Saks has flourished.
“She’s exemplary,” Gould Dean Robert Rasmussen said. “She has nothing but the highest scholarly standards, she’s always supporting her colleagues and inspiring each of us. It’s almost unfathomable what she’s been able to do. Her story is incredibly gripping and moving, and the fact that she has overcome so much and been able to succeed is astonishing.”
Much of that inspiration comes from the work Saks has done. Saks, who has focused her career on mental health policy, has played an important role in the discussions of a multitude of mental health issues, including patients’ rights, the legal aspects of multiple-personality disorder and involuntary treatment.
“I like to think the policies I come up with are not biased because I’m a disgruntled ex-patient. I do propose things that wouldn’t have helped me but would have helped someone else,” she said. “When I do my scholarship, I’m on all sides of the couch so to speak. I used to represent people who were psychiatric patients and I do some consulting and I teach about mental health law … and then I have my own experiences.
“I like to think I can look at things from lots of different angles and that proves my scholarship instead of detracts from it.”
Although Saks might draw some inspiration from her past experiences, those who work with her — all of whom know about her diagnosis — say she is not defined by them.
“I don’t even think it’s a question of balancing mental health issues and professional life,” said Gould Professor Edward McCaffery, who has worked with Saks since 1989. “She’s been able to — beginning with her own will, her own agency — she’s been able to take control of her mental health condition and lead a normal, professional, high-functioning life.”
Saks said she has been able to better cope with her illness through her work.
“I’m lucky that I love to work. It really serves me well — it gives me a sense of focus and productivity and self-esteem,” she said. “For me, it’s one of the last things to go, so even if I’m starting to unravel, I can come into my office, sit and start writing an article or revising an article and that can focus my mind and push the other stuff to the fringes.”
But, Saks said, she is not the only one who has been able to manage her schizophrenia and be successful in the professional world.
Along with researchers from USC and UCLA, Saks is in the process of studying 20 high-functioning schizophrenics who, like herself, have developed ways to manage their symptoms to work as high-level professionals. They hope to use their research to develop a coping method for people with lower-functioning schizophrenia.
“Sometimes people tell me, ‘Elyn, you’re unique. There aren’t other people with schizophrenia like you.’ But that’s not true. We have an MD, we’ve got a couple of PhDs, some consumer advocates, full time students,” she said. “So I’m certainly not unique.”
To help other people with schizophrenia, Saks said the first thing she plans to do with her “genius grant” from the MacArthur Foundation is publish another book — this one a general interest book with interviews from other people with schizophrenia.
“I’ve told my story in my book, but I want to tell their stories,” she said.
Overall, Saks said one of her biggest goals — through her current work and future plans — is to encourage people with schizophrenia to not be held back by their diagnosis.
“I’m a really stubborn person, and that’s helped me and hurt me,” she said. “It’s helped me by saying, ‘You think I have this and I won’t be able to work? Well I’ll show you.’”
And, according to McCaffery, Saks has done just this.
“It’s not being a mental health patient half the time and a professional half the time,” he said. “She’s just Elyn Saks.”

As droves of students begin to migrate north for the weekend football game against Cal, so will the No. 3 USC men’s water polo team.
The Trojans take to the road to face No. 4 Cal and No. 16 Pacific in their second consecutive two-game weekend, a week after capping an undefeated homestand that featured No. 8 Pepperdine and Long Beach City College. The Trojans are 9-1 this season and undefeated in conference play.
“We’ve had our ups and downs. We’re not all the way to where we want to be, but there is progress,” said senior two-meter Shea Buckner. “We want to go to NCAA Championships.”
The Trojans’ matchup with Cal on Saturday looks to live up to the two teams’ storied rivalry, as both of the schools enter the weekend ranked in the top five nationally. In the past three years, the teams have met twice in the NCAA Championship, with the Bears coming out victorious both times. This includes a win in 2006 that was decided by a single goal scored in the final second of the game. The Trojans were 2-0 against the Bears in 2008, and won each of the closely contested games in the final minutes en route to an undefeated 29-0 championship season.
Buckner, who transferred from Cal to USC after his freshman year, knows what to expect from a strong Golden Bear attack.
“They’ve got good leadership. They’re really fast and great on the counter-attack,” Buckner said. “They play with a lot of energy and physicality.”
USC already faced off against Cal once this season when the teams met in the third place game of the NorCal Tournament in Palo Alto, Calif. The Trojans bested the Bears 8-6, in a game that featured eight different Trojan players scoring goals.
Pacific, who faces USC on Sunday in Stockton, Calif., has not had nearly as much success against the Trojans as Cal, having lost the last eight games played between the two teams. The Trojans were 2-0 against Pacific in 2008 and averaged a seven-goal margin of victory in the two wins. USC has a 35-7 all-time record against Pacific, and their .833 winning percentage over the Tigers is the third-highest out of all the opponents the Trojans face in 2009.
“Pacific isn’t an easy team either. Cal is obviously the focus, but you have to be ready for the game against Pacific at their home,” Buckner said.
Senior driver Justin Rappel leads the Trojans with 16 goals scored, while fellow senior driver Matt Sagehorn follows closely behind with 14. USC’s veterans continue to dominate offensively, as five of the Trojan’s top six scorers are seniors.
Sophomore goalie Joel Dennerley, who recorded eight saves in the Pepperdine match last weekend, now has 60 saves this season, and is averaging less than four goals allowed per game so far in 2009. He continues to anchor a powerful Trojan defense that has not surrendered more than eight goals in any game this season.
“Our goal is to never give up more than four goals a game,” Buckner said. “We’re always well prepared and we know our system. As long as we stick to it, we do a good job.”

As candidates and politicos across the state prepare for the race to replace California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger — State Attorney General Jerry Brown filed exploratory papers Tuesday, and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman announced her candidacy last week — Students for Gavin Newsom is getting a headstart on campaigning and recruiting supporters at USC.
The student coalition for Newsom, the current mayor of San Francisco, was founded in April, 19 months before the 2010 state election. It now boasts 25 active members with more than 300 signed supporters, according to Kim Ueyama, the group’s field director.
Gavinator · San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom has garnered a lot of early support from USC students and others throughout California. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“[The campaign] is really trying to develop the largest
grassroots, student-based coalition in the statewide election in California,” Ueyama said.
According to Thomas Hollihan, an expert in political communication and a USC professor, the early presence of a student campaign for Newsom can be attributed to his progressive policies and proposals. Students for Newsom is currently the only student group involved in the campaign for next year’s gubernatorial race, although Hollihan expects other organizations to start springing up as the election approaches.
“I think that when you come to students, the candidate that’s likely to attract the most interest early … would be Gavin Newsom,” Hollihan said. “His candidacy is likely to appeal to the more progressive students on our campus.”
Manisha Goud, a sophomore majoring in biological science and political science who was a volunteer in the Obama campaign last year, said she decided to start the campaign after seeing Newsom at a town hall in March.
Goud, who now serves as both the USC chapter director and the Los Angeles regional director for Students for Newsom, said the campaign team was already working with other chapter leaders to reach out to students in the area.
“We want to start off with a strong supporter base to show that Mayor Newsom does have support from Southern California schools, especially private schools,” Goud said.
On Saturday, the coalition will host one of the Newsom campaign’s five California phone banks. According to Goud, the students involved will use the opportunity to let Los Angeles residents know about Newsom’s candidacy and platform.
“We’re going to reach out to Gavin Newsom [supporters] and people in our community to let them know what he stands for,” she said. “We’re trying to work with other student groups like the GLBTA, environmental groups, and possibly the College Democrats in forming a coalition of support for Mayor Newsom.”
The campaign plans to draw from Newsom’s achievements as mayor — he is credited with establishing universal health care, affordable higher education and an extensive recycling program in San Francisco — in pitching him as a candidate to potential voters.
“What he’s done for San Francisco as the mayor is incredible. He completely changed the recycling program. I think if that was implemented on a larger scale, it would do a lot for California,” said Emily Gee, the deputy chapter director of the USC Students for Gavin Newsom.
According to Goud, Newsom’s strong support for GLBT rights would also be a significant advantage for the campaign at USC.
“Mayor Newsom is known for his outspoken views on gay marriage and gay rights. I think a lot of students can resonate with that on campus, especially the GLBTA crew,” Goud said. “There’s someone willing to fight for their rights.”
But Hollihan believes his steadfast support for gay rights will have its downside as well, referring to the position as “fracturing” for the populace.
“Newsom is going to get tremendous, enthusiastic support, because of his position,” he said. “And he’s going to get tremendous opposition, because he was so out in front of it when San Francisco was the first city to legalize gay marriage.”
With the recent budget cuts to the University of California, California State University and California Community Colleges,  the campaign is hoping students will be attracted to Newsom’s policies, especially his proposals to improve the state of higher education in California.
“[Newsom] is committed to making sure higher education is affordable and accessible to California students,” said  Nick Clemons, his campaign manager. “He is 100 percent against the fee increases that students in those two systems are being hit with right now.”
With Students for Newsom chapters at more than 40 UC, CSU and private universities in California, the candidate has already registered more than 5,000 student supporters, according to Clemons.
“I hope students will realize we’ve got a great opportunity,” said Eric Lee, a UC Davis student and the college director for Students for Gavin Newsom. “The state of California has really got some issues to tackle.”
According to Hollihan though, it is the magnitude of the problems the next governor will face that makes the race interesting.
“This state has proven to be almost ungovernable and the crises are so dramatic at the moment. The complexity of California is such that there are big structural problems that the next governor is going to have to deal with.” Hollihan said. “One has to wonder why people really want to take on a job like that.”

Throughout fall camp and into the season, Cal players have engaged in the chant “Pac-10 champs, that’s us!”
But if the Golden Bears are going to make their mantra come true, they will have to get past a team that they hasn’t beaten in six years.

During its run of seven straight Pac-10 championships, USC has seen many contenders to its conference supremacy. Cal has been one of its primary threats, but the Golden Bears have yet to break through to the Pac-10’s top spot.
But No. 24 Cal will be trying to reverse that trend when it hosts No. 7 USC at Memorial Stadium on Saturday at 5 p.m.
The conference clash was once thought to be a meeting of the Pac-10’s two decidedly best teams, with both USC and Cal ranked in the top 10 two weeks ago.
But some of the game’s luster has worn off after both teams lost their conference openers on the road. USC was stunned by Washington two weeks ago and Cal ran into a buzz saw when it faced Oregon last week and lost, 42-3.
For either team, a loss would severely damage any hopes of an outright conference title and shot at playing in the Rose Bowl at the season’s end.
“I’ve always said it about the Pac-10, you have to bring your A-game each and every week to be successful and I don’t see it any different this year,” Cal coach Jeff Tedford said.
The Trojans’ preparation this week was put on the back burner when Stafon Johnson’s weightlifting accident Monday left a dark cloud over the program throughout the week.
USC coach Pete Carroll said the team was keeping the senior in mind while not letting it become a distraction for the week’s game.
“The concern about the effect of this and having the effect on the game is not even an issue for us at all,” Carroll said. “I think our concern for now is Stafon and his family and everybody handling what’s going on.”
Despite losing handily to the Ducks last week, the Golden Bears are expected to pose numerous problems for the Trojans.
Cal leads the Pac-10 in scoring offense with an average of 37.2 points per game. The team’s attack is highlighted by junior running back Jahvid Best, a Heisman Trophy candidate who leads the conference in rushing touchdowns.
Last week against Oregon, Best was held to a season-low 55 yards on 16 carries. In last year’s game against the Trojans, the junior was bottled up for 30 yards on 13 carries in USC’s 17-3 win at the Coliseum.
But the Trojans are expecting to have their hands full with the star ball-carrier on Saturday.
“They know how to move him all around,” Carroll said. “They’re doing what we would think would be exactly the right stuff which makes it really hard to center in and focus on him.”
True freshman quarterback Matt Barkley has drawn equal amounts of praise throughout the week from Tedford. Although he is still on the mend, USC’s signal-caller could see plenty of opportunities against a suddenly vulnerable Cal secondary.
The Golden Bears allowed Oregon quarterback Jeremiah Masoli to throw for 253 yards and three touchdowns, all of which went to tight end Ed Dickson, on 21-of-25 passing. The previous week against Minnesota, Cal’s secondary allowed Eric Decker to haul in eight passes for 119 yards and two touchdowns.
“I think sometimes the veteran guys, they try to do too much and then take their eyes where they’re not supposed to be,” Tedford said. “That happened a couple times last week.”
Despite being ranked 67th in the country in passing, USC is optimistic about its chances in the passing game with Barkley, even though an injury to the quarterback’s throwing shoulder is keeping him from feeling 100 percent.
“He’s capable of throwing and has been introduced to everything that we’ve ever had,” Carroll said. “We need to do things he can do really well.”
Yawn. The stakes aren’t high, nothing is riding on this game. Both teams have now lost to unranked opponents, and subsequently lost all respect. The only way either one of them have a chance at winning a title is if they play each other, or some other team that’s half as overrated as they are. No self-respecting intelligent football fan takes either team seriously. We all just kind of look at the matchup and laugh at the futile efforts both teams are making.

Bo DeHuff knew he was in trouble. But nobody else did.
Redshirt sophomore DeHuff came to the second hole on the second day of a junior golf tournament as the leader. He held the overnight lead, and he was hitting the ball well. It was his senior year of high school, and he was headed to USC the next year to play on the men’s golf team. He was in a pretty enviable position.
But on that second hole, DeHuff recognized that something wasn’t right. Ever since sixth grade, he had clipped the same divot repair tool to his pocket — every day. As he checked around, he realized the repair tool was nowhere to be found.
Suddenly, just as he seemed to be getting into a groove, he started struggling. The front nine was tough, and he knew that he had to just get through the back nine and close out with a decent score.
He did just that and, with the repair tool recovered and clipped onto his pocket for the next two days, he rebounded and won the junior golf tournament.
Some people might think DeHuff, who is now a golfer on the USC men’s golf team, is crazy. He let a trivial matter, something that shouldn’t have changed the outcome of the match, invade his mindset. Indeed, there was nothing wrong with his swing, his clubs, the course or the weather. So, why should his forgotten divot tool make a difference?
“In golf, a lot of lucky things can happen,” DeHuff said. “You can get a good bounce or a bad break. That is where the superstition develops.”
Part of the wonder of sports is that athletes are superstitious. There might not be a larger group in society that believes so much in the influence of a seemingly meaningless action on performance or outcome. Almost every athlete has some sort of pregame ritual or lucky clothing.
DeHuff strays from those common superstitions. He replaced the repair tool with quarters about three years ago. He now marks his ball on the green with a quarter from the 1960s, because any score in the 60s is a good score for the round.
He makes sure he always has five different quarters from five different years. He even has a superstition within his superstition in that his favorite quarter is one from 1967 because seven is his lucky number. No word on whether he prefers heads or tails.
DeHuff isn’t the only USC athlete who has what could be called unusual superstitions.
Sophomore Ashley Freyer is on the USC women’s soccer team, and, if you’ve ever been to a game and looked closely, you might notice she is one of the only players wearing white cleats. She only wears white cleats, even if it draws comparisons to an iconic Disney character.
“My mom says they look like Mickey Mouse shoes on me,” Freyer said.
Like most athletes, Freyer’s superstition developed after a good performance. She wore white cleats during her freshman year of high school and turned into Cristiano Ronaldo.
From then on, Freyer and her white cleats became a tighter pair than Dennis Rodman and his hair. She tried black cleats once for a week during her senior year. Needless to say, she quickly abandoned those and she will do anything to avoid playing without white cleats.
Yet, that’s exactly what happened a few years ago when she traveled to Arizona for a tournament in high school. She realized two hours before her first game that she forgot her cleats at home in California. So instead of borrowing a teammate’s pair, she went to the nearest soccer store and bought a very cheap pair of white cleats.
“I’m never making that mistake again,” Freyer said.
Freyer knows what it’s like to face the task of playing without being fully prepared, as does sophomore water polo player Matt Burton. Burton has a playlist he listens to before every game, and if it’s time to start before the playlist finishes, Burton gets nervous.
Before Burton’s last game, “I’m Going In” by Lil Wayne, Young Jeezy and Drake blasted from his earbuds. When it came time to go, he was only halfway through the song and started panicking.
“It’s halfway through the song. Everybody’s jumping in the water and I’m just sitting in my locker like come on, come on, come on,” Burton said. “I didn’t get to listen to the full song.”
Usually Burton is able to listen to all three songs on his playlist: Eminem’s “Till I Collapse,” a song by Rage Against the Machine and “I’m Going In.” He changes the playlist after a bad performance, so it says something that he’s had the same playlist the entire year. Like Freyer, he started listening to a set playlist after a good game in high school, and he doesn’t dare to try and play without listening to his songs.
Superstitions are a part of sports, especially USC sports. If DeHuff loses his divot tool, Freyer plays without white cleats or Burton doesn’t listen to his music before a game, they could suffer through a bad performance.
Athletes need superstitions and rely on them as a form of psychological stability and preparation.
It’s not like in Space Jam, when the Monstars steal the talent from the NBA players. Freyer’s talent doesn’t disappear if she loses her white cleats.
But don’t try and steal them from her, because she will find a way to get new ones.

A lot has happened since the last time the USC women’s soccer team played a home game.
The Women of Troy left home as a young team struggling to find chemistry on the field. Questions lingered about the backline as junior Ashli Sandoval tore her ACL and All-American redshirt senior Meagan Holmes was still out with a knee injury.
Shutout specialist · USC goalie Kristin Olsen has held three of the team’s last four opponents scoreless, a major reason for USC’s turnaround. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
But No. 19 USC (7-3) returns home as a new team. The Women of Troy are riding a six-game winning streak after defeating two ranked teams on their recent four-game road trip. The team is still young, but they are back in the rankings for the first time in a month. Apparently a long road trip was just what the team needed.
“Our chemistry has gotten better with traveling,” junior midfielder Alyssa Davila said. “Traveling helped a lot and we’ve come a long way by practicing and spending time together.”
Today, the Women of Troy will get a chance to showcase the team’s improved harmony in their last non-conference game against No. 25 San Diego (6-3-1) at McAlister Field at 3 p.m.
A big reason for USC’s winning streak has been the improved play on defense and the outstanding goalkeeping by senior Kristin Olsen. Olsen has recorded three shutouts in the last four games and became the third player to win back-to-back Pac-10 Player of the Week honors.
But that’s not to take anything away from a vastly improved offense that previously had trouble finishing. In the last two home games in mid-September against Gonzaga and Michigan, USC had 41 shots and only four goals, or one goal every 10.25 shots. However, the Women of Troy have more than doubled their efficiency in the last two games, scoring five goals on 24 shots, or one goal every 4.8 shots.
“What’s happening is everyone is focused on finishing a possession rather than just focused on getting a shot off,” sophomore forward Ashley Freyer said. “We want points on the board and everyone is hungry for a goal.”
Coach Ali Khosroshahin acknowledges that his team has come a long way from being the great team he knows they can be, but he knows that it takes time for new players to adjust to their roles and to the team. He finally sees that happening.
“As the season goes on, that’s what’s supposed to happen. People are supposed to get comfortable in their roles and decision-making,” Khosroshahin said.
One of the players finding comfort in her new role is freshman midfielder Kat Parker. Khosroshahin inserted Parker into the lineup in the second half against Pacific last Friday when USC was trailing 2-0. Parker calmed the team down and helped the Women of Troy dominate possession, something they weren’t able to do in the first half. As a result, they scored three goals and won 3-2.
Khosroshahin would still like to see ball control and possession improve this weekend. USC was able to knock the ball around well in one half against Pacific, but not in the other half.
“We need to play simpler and just take care of the ball. Our possession is still inconsistent,” Khosroshahin said.
USC might still have a lot to work on to become the best team it possibly can be, but there’s no denying that this is a different team than the one that left home three weeks ago with a 3-3 record. New starters scored the game-winning goals in all four road wins, and the players now know they can beat almost any team. But they are careful not to get too caught up in their recent success.
“We haven’t met our standards yet so we are going to keep focusing on that,” Khosroshahin said.

As part of a push to meet high demand for blood at university medical centers, the USC Blood Donor Center at the Health Sciences Campus will open an additional location in the University Village Monday.
The current center at the Health Sciences campus has been open since 1996 and supplies the USC University Hospital and the USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, which USC purchased in April. The acquisition has increased the need for blood, and the USC Blood Donor Center hopes to help fill this need by opening the UV location.
Fresh blood · Beginning Monday, the USC University Hospital and the USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center will have access to more blood and platelets thanks to the opening of a new blood donor center in the University Village. - Vicki Yang | Daily Trojan
“What we really want to do is try to get the freshest blood possible for the hospital by having a donor center very close to campus,” said Maria Muniz, senior site manager of the USC Blood Donor Center. “We’re trying to encourage USC students to donate blood and platelets to better serve the hospital that needs them.”
As of now, the donor center is able to provide about 70 percent of the blood the university’s hospital needs, with the rest coming from secondary sources, Muniz said. The donor center hopes to eventually be able to fill 100 percent of the hospital’s blood needs.
Ira Shulman, professor and vice chair of pathology at the Keck School of Medicine said opening a donor center in the UV will help the USC hospitals become more self-sufficient.
“A donor center so close to campus will improve awareness and direct support for USC hospitals and their patients among USC students,” Shulman wrote in an email. “The convenient location and extended hours of operation may encourage students to donate more frequently.”
The HSC donor center bases its hours around the needs of the hospital. But once the UV center opens, its operating hours will be based on feedback from students.
“This will help the hospital tap into all the units it can potentially get,” Muniz said. “Right now, we’re open Monday through Friday, and closed on Thursday. But if students say Saturday is a good day [to donate], we will definitely look into that.”
Currently, students interested in donating blood around campus have to use the trucks that are often seen on Trousdale Parkway. The new center, however, will help the hospitals collect specific components they need, while the trucks focus just on blood.
“The center will specialize in collections using automated equipment to draw platelets and red cells from donors that meet specific requirements or have particular blood types that are in short supply at the hospital,” Shulman wrote. “Operation of the USC bloodmobiles will continue to focus on whole blood collections.”
Shulman said he expects the new center will have a significant impact on the hospital.
“This was the experience seen recently at UCLA, when that institution opened a blood and platelet donor center on campus this past summer. Donations among the student population rose because of the convenient location,” he wrote.
Students said having a permanent center close to campus would make them more likely to donate.
Sharon Kim, an undeclared freshman, donated blood frequently in high school, and has donated blood once since she’s been at USC. Though she said she didn’t mind giving blood to the donation truck, she believes some students would feel more comfortable donating blood in a formal location.
“Giving blood is a big deal to some people,” Kim said. “And some might not want to give blood to a random truck parked on campus.”
David Yoo, a junior majoring in creative writing, hasn’t donated blood to USC, but said he had similar feelings on the subject.
“I think it’s a good idea to have a location in an established building,” Yoo said. “It’ll definitely make it more convenient for students to have a center at the UV.”
Muniz said she hopes this new center will encourage students who are willing and able to donate blood to those in need.
“We want students to feel like they’re making USC get stronger,” Muniz said. “Every donor counts. Every single one.”

Composing for film, like every other facet of the film industry, has rapidly changed in recent decades due to advances in technology, the growth of popular culture and an increasingly independent mindset. As such, it is becoming increasingly difficult for young and talented composers to find success, or even recognition, in Hollywood.
Saturday, Oct. 3 marks the first conference held by the Film Music Guild, a new organization founded by a group of ambitious students at Biola University. The guild has been busy arranging workshops and seminars for those eager to learn the ins and outs of commercial composing while also emphasizing the skills needed to be an effective storyteller.
The guild aims to provide members with the most savvy information that is available to the craft. Topics of discussion at the conference will include the business of music, musical storytelling and modern film composing.
The conference will feature a powerhouse ensemble of speakers including Pete Docter (director of Pixar’s Monster’s Inc and Up), award-winning film composer and editor John Ottman (The Usual Suspects, Valkyrie, X-Men 2), and Christopher Young (composer for The Exorcism of Emily Rose).
David Martina, Film Music Guild president, feels the conference will cement the guild’s place in the industry.
“[The guild is looking to] establish a credible name-brand as a basis to build connections and networks between students and professionals,” Martina said.
Students and professionals alike agree that the business of scoring for movies is a cutthroat one, with jobs for composers as competitive as ever.
Joel Kreimeyer-Kelly, a scoring for motion pictures student, said he’d be “crazy” not to worry about finding work after graduation, and feels like it’s an unfair ratio of network to talent.
“I know some awesome musicians who just haven’t met the right people,” Kreimeyer-Kelley said.
USC professor of Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television Jon Burlingame agreed with Kreimeyer-Kelley’s sentiment.
“There are fewer movies made at studio level today, but more at an independent level,” Burlingame said.
Independent films often offer more range for creativity, but pay far less. Martina worries for the livelihood of the artists acquiring most of these jobs, warning that composers for film are often abused because they don’t have a union to fight for them.
“Composers have no bargaining chips. There are so many aspiring composers, they could be skipped over for someone willing to work cheaper,” Martina explained. “They are entirely at the mercy of the producer.”
Burlingame added that composers are also often under appreciated. Composers are hurt by the fact that “most film critics don’t understand the importance of film music, and therefore almost never mention it.”
According to Burlingame, music also  plays a key role in setting the location, mood and atmosphere of the story.
“People think of movies as a visual medium, but they’re not,” Burlingame explained. “They’re audio-visual.”
The emotional component music contributes to film is paramount to the overall success of moving an audience. Strong director-composer duos seamlessly connect the audio and visual portions of the story. Burlingame noted that pairs like Alfred Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann, who worked together on Psycho, North by Northwest and Vertigo, to name a few, yielded extraordinary results.
But this challenge of collaborating with a director is one of the chief factors that attracts composers to certain films.
“It’s very cool to get their vision across,” Kreimeyer-Kelley said.
And even though the primary goal of the music is to enhance the emotional undercurrent of a story, Burlingame reminds us that “the best film music works outside the confines of the film itself.”
The basic function of music in film, to assist a story and convey emotion, has never changed. And it probably never will, despite the fact that scoring films is done quite differently than it was in the Golden Age. For example, editing was once a much trickier process, involving the physical cutting of film. Now, with the advent of Avid, Final Cut Pro and all the other editing software, editing a film is so easy, it can be done up until the very last minute. This has made it very difficult for composers to keep up with the changes.
“Even the most minor changes visually change what the composer has to do,” says Burlingame.
But Burlingame says technologies have also made it easier on composers. Synthesizers and samplers allow instant playback of ideas and permutations, which enriches the collaboration between director and composer. There’s also a much greater variety in the types of music composed for film than there once was.
“You can take your music anywhere,” says Kreimeyer-Kelly. “Period pieces, techno, ethnic music or orchestral.”
The addition of pop songs, when used appropriately, has also enriched the film music experience.
The most troublesome change for Martina has been the accessibility of applications like Pro Tools and Garage Band. According to Martina, the quality of scores can greatly suffer from the overuse of these products, “over-saturating the industry and cheapening the process of writing songs. People who have studied music have more of a voice than those with just the tools.”
Although the film-scoring business is often an intimidating one, Martina and Burlingame do have words of advice. “Get as much training as you possibly can [in music] — and remember that this is a theatrical profession. Its all about the drama,” he said. Martina feels that unfortunately in this business, “it’s not what you know, but who you know… but don’t be that guy who just wants to give out business cards. Show people that you actually value them.”

Cinematic spectacle is on life support.
In some ways, the death knell of grand, eye-popping feats of onscreen ingenuity and artistry was finally sounded this year by the hack trio of Michael Bay, Stephen Sommers and Roland Emmerich.
With Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra and the upcoming 2012, these three filmmakers have signaled the final devolution of the disaster movie into grandiose, CGI-swollen pissing contests to determine who can blow up the most famous landmarks.
Regardless of the efforts of Hollywood to gorge themselves to death on CGI, digital cinema and obscene running times, the very notion of film as true spectacle remains in a strange purgatory. The limbo was created mostly due to the efforts of Jeffrey Katzenberg and James Cameron in pushing the medium fully into the third dimension.
Katzenberg, that gregarious DreamWorks Animation CEO who has poured an untold fortune into the technology, would certainly have you believe that 3-D is the future of the medium. With the help of his competitors at Disney, he is determined to shove it down our throats whether we want it or not.
Disney, not far behind DreamWorks, will release redone versions of the classic Pixar films Toy Story and Toy Story 2 in 3-D this weekend. The Toy Story films are undoubtedly made for such a transition — all manner of things have potential to fly off the screen in startling fashion — but it will be interesting to see if the narrative flow suffers from the distractions that 3-D entails.
Certainly, the wonderful colors will grow blander. Thankfully, Disney’s upcoming classically animated The Princess and the Frog will be in beautiful 2-D.
For all the money the industry is using to push the format, 3-D remains a gimmick. The process dulls color and the projection detracts from the image. Look at Up, that great Pixar film from this summer, which relied so heavily on color and conveyed the majesty of flight and motion so effectively in two dimensions — an emotional display Bay, Emmerich and Sommers could never reproduce.
So far, however, all 3-D has done for cinema is repeat the extravagant act of having objects fly off the screen and into your face to the point of exhaustion. For narrative and for visual coherency — falling deeply into the world on screen without being aware of it — it adds nothing.
The only hope for the third dimension in cinema stands with the master of modern spectacle, Cameron.
The Academy Award-winning director’s forthcoming Avatar, which might just arrive in theaters as the most expensive movie ever made, meshes the lifelike digital motion capture pioneered by Robert Zemeckis with Cameron’s own experiments in immersive 3-D technology. It is the film he has wanted to make since Titanic. It is the film he desires to use to redefine cinema as a visual and narrative experience. Lofty expectations, to be sure, but Cameron knows film — his films are wildly successful and critically acclaimed.
With money and preparation, any animated film can have the third dimension quality added in scenes of mayhem, but Cameron’s purpose with Avatar runs so much deeper. He wants to change the way we are immersed in a film’s world. It is easy to imagine the innovative director, so obsessed with deep sea diving, visualizing a cinema built on a similar model. The spectator floats in the fantasy onscreen, lost in the life passing him or her by. It would be a rebirth of cinema spectacle.
The preview footage of Avatar was received mildly and the trailer footage doesn’t seem to represent any revolution in narrative. Speculation into what Cameron’s film, if successful, might yield is especially difficult to predict. The process is expensive and, really, would only work for spectacle. Can you imagine an Apatow film or a courtroom drama in immersive 3-D?
Whenever this empty challenge that cinematic spectacle has become enters my mind, I think it would be nice to have been there at the beginning, in 1895 when cinema pioneers Auguste and Louis Lumière premiered their short film, Arrival of a Train at a Station. The pure spectacle of reproduced motion infamously drove patrons in terror from the theater. It was a simpler time.
While I might seem like some film studies snob sitting in his ivory, two-dimensional tower bemoaning the state of the medium — which is exactly what I am — innovation without purpose adds nothing to any art form or business model. Sure, Cameron’s experiment makes me very excited, but Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 3-D does not. If the format doesn’t have any room to expand within, then it will quickly grow tired and audiences will no longer seek it out.
3-D could be the wave of the future, the next step in a long tradition of cinema as spectacle and, if Cameron’s experiment proves successful, a new means of storytelling. All one can do is wait for December. As it stands now, 3-D remains an expensive, questionably lucrative gimmick — a revelation sold by false prophets as the next evolution.

As a quiet, under-the-radar home to many musicians and artists, Eagle Rock gives an incredibly extensive celebration to unite its residents with other performers in Southern California. Drive along Colorado Boulevard on Oct. 3, and you will find the centerpiece of its cultural events.
First held in October 1998 inside local restaurants and shops as a modest endeavor, the Eagle Rock Music Festival has become a nationally recognized event. As the festival gradually developed a devoted following, the number of attendees became a safety hazard, occasionally crowding into the streets. As a result, the festival underwent a major shift in 2006, closing off Colorado Boulevard for the evening to set up grand stages from Argus Street to Eagle Rock Boulevard.

With an audience of more than 30,000 at last year’s event, the festival is expected to push the boundaries again this year with potentially 40,000 or more attendees. Even the local fire department has shown concern about the large number of expected people.
A majority of festival-goers will be Eagle Rock residents, but residents from all over Los Angeles are expected to constitute much of the turnout.
“People from out of Eagle Rock can get to see what’s happening in this part of town,” Brian Martinez, director of festival events, said. “It allows Eagle Rock to differentiate itself and its music as being more organic as opposed to other music events that are all too common in LA.”
The greatest factor for the festival’s steady growth is that there is no charge. People are free to walk the closed-off streets without buying any tickets or paying entry fees, although donations are gladly accepted. This is thanks to the local businesses, the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs and co-sponsor LA City Councilmember José Huizar.
“Sponsorships have taken twice as long to get, to raise the same if not less money than last year,” Martinez explained. “Businesses have been really open and gracious, though.”
The festival’s outdoor atmosphere is a perfect way for local shops to expose themselves and appeal to residents who haven’t given them a try yet. Restaurants like Colombo’s and Camilo’s will host jazz bands, while the Women’s Twentieth Century Club will showcase revival rock.
One of the festival’s common themes — diversity of multicultural art — was a large factor in finding a wide range of music to be performed. While rock music has always been very popular at past festivals, support from sponsors, such as a grant from the James Irvine Foundation, allows greater freedom in the styles and genre of music this year. Though all the bands are from Southern California, there are a variety of performers — ’60s Middle Eastern psychedelic band The Gaslamp Killer and KoTolan’s Japanese salsa are only a taste of the eclectic musical acts featured this year.
Up from last year’s 40 bands, this festival will feature 60 musical groups.
“There’s no hierarchy — no real headliners,” Martinez said. “Certain bands got certain time slots and we put others later on or earlier to spread attention.”
According to Martinez, this year’s event has been focused on “refining relationships with programming partners.”
DUBLAB, the festival’s programming partner, is a collective of artists, musicians and performers founded by USC alumni, Mark McNeill. The collective is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year with 10 events starting Oct. 1 — one of which, the Future Roots Stage, will be at the music festival and includes diverse music like cosmic experimentalism from Julia Holter and Indonesian gamelan by Bali and Beyond Gamelan Ensemble.
With a firm infrastructure set in place, future festivals are guaranteed. In its 11th year, Eagle Rock Music Festival is still relatively young.
“As long as we keep the community included and focus on bringing music rather than profiting,” Martinez said, “I expect to see many more festivals.”
Among the bands performing at this year’s festival are LA music scene staples The Happy Hollows, No Age and Pocahaunted.

Good ol’ blue eyes, Frank Sinatra, was known not only for his charm and voice, but also for something he owed solely to genetics: his baby blues.
Blue eyes have long been alluring, in part because of their rarity: One must receive two recessive blue alleles — one from each parent — in order to exhibit the trait.
Interestingly, research conducted by Dr. Yazhu Ling, who performed a study on color preferences, has shown that there seems to be a universal preference to the color blue in general — evolutionarily, blue signals clear weather and a good water source, among other things.
However, studies show blue eyes are becoming increasingly rare, leading us to question how this will shape the traditionally unshakable Western beauty norm in the United States.
Where did blue eyes come from? And why have they stuck around? A recent study by researchers in Denmark reports that all blue-eyed people have one common ancestor, whose genes mutated 6,000 to 10,000 years ago in an area in the Balkans or near the Black Sea. Humans originally all had brown eyes prior to this. The study was led by Hans Eiberg, who traced the phenotype of blue eyes back to one specific area near a gene which affects melanin production. Blue eyes can, in effect, be seen as diluted brown eyes.
But if Darwin’s theories are to be believed, populations vary when mutations create new alleles and they are passed onto offspring through genes because of some evolutionary advantage they possess. If blue eyes came from one ancestor, why were they passed on — why were they favored?
It has been suggested that blue eyes, like lighter skin, provide an advantage to those living in colder climates because lower melanin levels allow for more vitamin D absorption from the sun. Some have also argued that at some point there was a genetic bottleneck where some survivors were blue eyed, passing on the gene through the population at a higher rate than it would have previously.
Nevertheless, these hypotheses remain untested and we are still left wondering why blue eyes have persisted, and why they are so often favored.
A study led by Dr. Bruno Laeng at the University of Tromso in Norway theorizes that blue-eyed mates are more attractive to blue-eyed men because it provides a man the evolutionary advantage of ensuring paternity in his blue-eyed child.
The researchers tested a group of 88 college students and showed them images of male and female models, whose eye colors were digitally manipulated to be blue or brown. The students were then asked to rank the photos by attractiveness on a scale of one to five, and the study found that blue-eyed men preferred blue-eyed women, rating them an average of 3.29, as opposed to 2.79 for the brown-eyed women.
While cultural factors could influence the results of the study, Laeng’s theory has legitimate anthropological reasoning. Why should males waste resources nurturing genes that aren’t their own? One need only look to the phenomenon of infanticide in primates to see the lengths that males of some species go to in order to promote their genes over those of other males.
While we may not know the exact evolutionary reasons as to why blue eyes have endured, they do seem to possess a certain allure. Carolyn Kaufman of Otterbein College in Ohio speculated that when people see something pleasurable, their eyes dilate to signal happiness; since dilated pupils are easier to see in lighter eyes, blue eyes could have a natural appeal. And blue eyes have long been the subject of fascination — regarded as preferable in Europe as far back as the Middle Ages, according to Face Value, a book by Hema Sundaram about the history of beauty.
But to say that blue eyes and fair skin are favored in the area where they may have originated seems only to say that there is cultural preference for eye color, and nothing more. One could extrapolate this idea to our country of America, and say that Americans also have such a preference, as our European founders came from the same location as did blue eye color.
However, as the cultural tides of the US change, it seems that blue eyes are becoming increasingly rare, attributable to immigration patterns, intermarriage and genetics. At the turn of the 20th century, about half of Americans born had blue eyes, but by the mid-century, this proportion had dropped to about a third, and is now currently lingering around one-sixth.
Mark Grant, an epidemiologist who conducted a study on the declining rate of blue eyes in America, argues that a century ago more people married within their ethnic group — meaning that the recessively inherited blue eyes were easily passed down. By mid-century, however, the historic taboo of intermarriage between nationalities began to fade. From 1900 to 1950, about one in 10 Americans was nonwhite, but today that ratio is 35 percent, suggesting that the “unusual” decline of blue eyes in America has more to do with changing demographics and cultural stereotypes, rather than any kind of evolutionary advantage or disadvantage blue eyes may have.
As the world’s population continues to mix and mingle — with increasingly fluid travel between countries, more diversity in ethnic composition and greater exposure to other cultures — perhaps our beauty norms will shift, and blue eyes will disappear altogether.

We also learned in one of my anthropology classes that blue eyes let in more light than brown eyes. They were therefore an evolutionary advantage areas with short days and long winters because you could see better in dim lighting. Brown eyes let in less light, which is what you would want in Africa and the Mediterranean since excessive sunlight is bad for your eyes.
I think blue-eyes are more of a Euro-centric aesthetic appeal. I like dark features.
Yesterday I had brown eyes, today I have pink eyes

The US educational system has long relied on standardized testing as an academic, economic and social barometer. From the yearly pageantry of the SAT to the slightly obscure and more Midwestern ACT, the tradition of tests with acronyms of dubious origin has been a mainstay of elementary, high school  and post-grad culture for decades. The system has garnered its fair share of criticism in the past decade, however, as standardized tests have come into more prominence.
Critics point to many drawbacks.; the tests narrow school curricula to only what is tested. The questions are biased in favor of the demographic group that creates the questions — statistically, white and middle class. Tests evaluate students without regard to learning difficulties, and only focus on a small portion of what could be termed a student’s general aptitude.
The vocal anti-standardized testing constituency hoped that President Barack Obama would help shelve the archaic testing formula in his recent agenda to improve education. Specifically, many hoped Obama would start the process of undoing former President George W. Bush’s well-intentioned but woefully inept No Child Left Behind Act, which established a system that linked school funding to net improvement in standardized scores.
The act has many flaws, despite its Lifetime Movie Network-like name. Tests administered under the act fail to accommodate students with disabilities or learning difficulties, and don’t provide resources for students for whom English is a second language. Corrective policies enforced in lower-performing schools are counterproductive — as programs that need more help are the ones that produce lower test scores, and thus are denied much-needed funds.
Unexpectedly, Obama reinforced the act by calling for more states to use standardized testing as a measure for evaluating both teachers and students.
Standardized testing has shown itself to be a flawed practice. By utilizing it not only as an evaluation of a student’s intelligence, but also a determination of a school’s financial future, the United States is encouraging a vicious cycle.
It is up to Obama to reverse a history of bad decisions made in the educational spectrum. Will he accept the challenge?

Job has nothing on Larry Gopnik.
A Serious Man, Joel and Ethan Coen’s darker-than-dark comedic update of the Old Testament story to a modern, thoroughly Jewish setting, places its pathetic protagonist in the position of fate’s punching bag.

The film opens in old Poland with the parable of a Yiddish couple’s run-in with a possible dybbuk, a reanimated corpse. The scene shallowly predicts the origins of Larry Gopnik’s curse but offers no deep or lasting connection to the main narrative.
The story shifts to Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor in late 1960s Minnesota who rather suddenly finds his family collapsing, his job prospects dwindling and his faith in his community shaken.
A Serious Man is strongly situated in its setting, partially as a function of its quasi-autobiographical nature. As with Fargo, the Coens draw from their own childhood experiences in the Midwest to create a complex canvas blotted with truths and fictions.
Certainly the film’s revolutionary themes ­— free love and Jefferson Airplane’s “Somebody to Love” serve as motifs — seen through the perspective of a stagnating religious community make it a unique perspective on a too often revisited part of American history.
One of the major problems with the Coens — who still might rank as the greatest modern American filmmakers — is that they hold such little respect for their characters. In pulling from their own Jewish upbringing, yet maintaining that level of disdain, they infuse their film with a generally negative image of American Jews.
A Serious Man is a deeply Jewish film — the press notes that accompanied it even included an extremely useful glossary of Yiddish and Hebrew terms. Paradoxically, the film is so saturated with the religion and culture of American Judaism that it becomes a strong criticism of that community. Unsubtly, the film is ostensibly about the impotence of religion and community in the face of depression and loss. But because it is the Coens, it is also about beating a character up as much as possible within a two-hour running time.
Nobody within Larry’s community can offer him substantial help and many serve as stubborn roadblocks to his progression — which is the joke and the point — but the Coens take these images to an extreme that might come off as anti-Semitic for anyone not in line with their derisive style of writing.
The real triumph of A Serious Man lies in the casting. The Coens pulled numerous members of the Minnesota theater community for bit parts and one-offs. The players use their one or two scenes to create strong impressions of nuanced characters, the best of whom might be George Wyner as a rambling rabbi who — in a reflection of the film itself — imparts on Larry a parable that lacks a message.
At the center of the maelstrom of Midwestern Jewish angst sways Michael Stuhlbarg in a nearly perfect performance as Larry. Stuhlbarg and the Coens effortlessly eschew the traditional character arc for a man under such duress and make Larry far more pitiful and identifiable than would be a man who simply lets the pressure build to a violent explosion in the third act.
After a schedule conflict barred his involvement from the Coens’ last film, Burn After Reading, Roger Deakins returned as cinematographer. His collaboration with the Coens, themselves great auteurs with a broad understanding of classical film, has yielded some of the most beautiful and effectively photographed films of the past 20 years.
The Coens and Deakins have created a world far removed from the epic legends O Brother, Where Art Thou? and No Country for Old Men. The film is small and ugly ­­— awash in the drabness that defined America on the eve of revolution. And though the filmmakers seem to ask some ancient and profound questions about the role of God in everyday life, Larry Gopnik’s world is marked by crushing insignificance.
Typical of the Coens — whose films seem so designed to go off the rails by the end — the last scene of A Serious Man lands a sucker punch on par with the masterful final moments of No Country for Old Men. Regardless of the scene’s power, it is ultimately an irreverent moment that effectively strips all meaning from Larry’s progression and from the film’s secular message. As they have done before, the Coens dare us to take them seriously and then mock us for doing so.
A Serious Man combines the best and the worst of the Coen Brothers into a narrative that is both complex and confused. The film might mean to inspire some deeper questions about religion and revolution, but the filmmakers would probably be just as happy if it didn’t. This is not Cormac McCarthy, after all. This is Joel and Ethan Coen, always masters of technique and tone but only occasionally masters of theme.
It would probably be enough for them to know that “Somebody to Love” is still playing in my head two weeks after seeing the film.

The first time Tito Rivera made the trek from El Salvador to Los Angeles, he was forced to move under the cover of night while using any means possible to cross the border.
The 43-year-old owner of Viztango Café was born in San Miguel, El Salvador, but fled in 1981 when a civil war overtook the country.

Rivera and his niece traveled for days before they made it across the border into the United States, eventually settling in Los Angeles.
“When you have no visa, you have to come however — by bus, by car, however,” said Rivera, who is now a US citizen.
Today, he travels in style.
Rivera, who has since become a successful restaurateur, now enjoys a more dependable method of transportation — his Cardinal and Gold-adorned Chevrolet Silverado.
He has also become active in the USC community, partnering with student organizations to give back to Salvadorans in need.
“You can see the necessity of the people,” he said. “They have nothing. They’re shoeless. They don’t have beds.”
But there was a time when Rivera was working hard just to fulfill his own needs and those of his family.
Fresh from El Salvador, the 15-year-old Rivera, charged with supporting his niece, found a job washing dishes at Dolores Restaurant & Bakery in West Los Angeles to pay his bills.
He worked his way up, landing a job at Campanile Restaurant and later spent 14 years as a cook under Wolfgang Puck at Spago in Malibu.
For much of that time, his country’s civil war prevented Rivera from returning home to El Salvador. It was not until 1992, 11 years after his departure, that Rivera returned to his family.
“I have my grandma; she’s 102 years old. She lives in the small town where we were born,” he said. “They were shot [at] with airplanes and everything, but she didn’t want to come along.”
Content with his life in Los Angeles, Rivera decided to stay in the United States, but began making annual trips home to visit family and to support his former community.
Soon, Rivera’s younger sister joined him in Los Angeles. He helped her enroll at USC and moved his family — a wife and two children — to the Jefferson Park neighborhood west of the University Park Campus.
It was there that he noticed a niche that his work experience could help him fill.
“I noticed there was nothing around, and we came up with the idea to bring in a restaurant,” he said.
With the money he had saved from working at Spago and the help of friends, Rivera drew up plans for the new restaurant.
“I wanted to have the food like in Malibu, where I had been working, but bring it to a price that students could pay for,” he said.
In 2003 Bistango Café, since renamed Viztango Café, opened its doors in the retail center on the corner of Figueroa and 30th streets.
Business was slow during the restaurant’s first three months, but it picked up once students returned to campus, and soon Rivera was forced to double his staff from eight to 16 to keep up with the rush.
“It was overnight,” he said. “Since then, we’ve gotten busier and busier. Now we are more and more stable, so we’re thinking about how to help people.”
The success of the restaurant encouraged Rivera to finally help his native country the way he had always wanted.
“People ask me, ‘You help because you have money,’” he said. “But I said, ‘No, because I have money makes me able to do it.’”
Rivera also became active in the USC community, donating more than $3,000 worth of food to the Swim With Mike fundraiser each year and often working with student groups on campus.
Rivera’s next venture is a fundraiser co-sponsored by Viztango and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, which will include food and live Latino music. All funds from the November event will go toward supporting impoverished Salvadorans.
“He came by the house and we just started talking and things went from there,” said Patrick Ahern, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention and the co-philanthropy chair for SAE.
Rivera has also partnered with the Central American Television Network and its anchor Antonio Ayala to raise money and toys to distribute throughout El Salvador in the winter.
Ayala, host of the program Hola El Salvador, has been building support for the Salvadoran community in Los Angeles, the second largest Latino community in California, for the last 13 years, and said he was enthusiastic when Rivera asked to come on board for the show’s annual Toy Telethon in November.
Ayala and Rivera expect to collect more than 50,000 toys at the fundraiser to distribute at churches, hospitals and other community centers in small Salvadoran villages over the winter holidays.
“I was born in a very small village and I remember, when I was a little kid, getting happy when someone gave me a toy,” Ayala, who is also a native of El Salvador, said.
Nearly 30 years removed from his initial covert journey out of El Salvador, Rivera remains rooted in his past, but embraces the life he’s made for himself at the heart of the USC student body. He owns football season tickets and can be seen driving his Trojan-colored Silverado to all events catered by Viztango.
“We feel like we are family. USC’s our family,” he said.
But despite his success, he will always feel an obligation to the people he left behind.
“When you want to help, you just feel it,” he said. “You don’t have to have money to do it.”
