It’s easy to feel tired of the endless onslaught of celebrity documentaries released every year. Unless you’re a die-hard Selenator, the announcement of  “Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me” may have simply been another headline to scroll past. But “My Mind & Me” differentiates itself from other celebrity documentaries in the fray, aiming higher and reaching its goal perfectly. While on a surface level, the film follows the same trope of peeking behind the curtain to reveal the dark side of a celebrity’s seemingly glamorous life, Gomez’s story has a way of lingering in your mind. 
Although originally slated to be a documentary about Gomez’s 2016 Revival Tour, the documentary developed into a journal chronicling Gomez’s mental health battle over the last six years. After Gomez canceled the tour due to depression and anxiety, the documentary revealed another reason Gomez never dressed — she suffered a psychotic break. 
Director Alek Keshishian initially believed there was no future for the film. But in 2019, Gomez invited Keshishian to film again. It was then that the movie took a turn — it would not be the story of Gomez’s career successes or a fight against controversies, but instead the story of a woman’s healing journey. 
“She was just out of the mental health facility, she had been diagnosed as bipolar, and I could see that there was so much hope in her, but also that she was still in recovery herself,” Keshishian said. “And she wasn’t entirely out of the woods, so to speak. She was trying to figure out what her purpose was and what she wanted in her life.” 
Keshishian describes his style as “cinéma vérité,” meaning he films everything. And at times, this can make the documentary uncomfortable to watch. Although Gomez consented to this when they first began filming, Keshishian began to feel that some moments were insensitive to film and didn’t want to cause Gomez any more stress. It was Gomez that requested that even her lowest moments, specifically in relation to her lupus, be filmed.
“She wanted people to see that rawness and that she’s going through pain. That’s not only physical, but also psychological pain,” Keshishian said. 
At times, Keshishian filmed using just his phone camera, with no other members of the crew in the room. The trust between Gomez and Keshishian is clear, as Gomez never seems to concern herself with the camera in the room. She openly fights with her friends, cries and delves into her struggles with bipolar depression. 
“The film is not just for people suffering [with] mental health. I think that people might be suffering [with] mental health, but it could just be that they’re feeling dark and isolated,” Keshishian said. “We’re living in a very isolated world, and I think that this movie reminds us of the power of human connection.”
While the film is clearly about superstar Selena Gomez, the end product is so much greater than that. Any self-commissioned documentary tends to have a twinge of narcissism, but Gomez and Keshishian somehow manage to dodge the overdone self-pitying fame trope. That’s not to say public figures don’t deserve to share a documentary about themselves, but “My Mind & Me” shouldn’t be put in the same category. 
Any person coming to the film for juicy gossip on Gomez’s exes or rumors will be sorely disappointed. “My Mind & Me” demands attention throughout its 95-minute runtime, never resorting to filler footage, fulfilling their promise to speak about mental health with no limits.  
“Our hope is, especially for some people that might not know what’s going on with them, and/or may feel isolated or depressed, there is a message of hope in this film,” Keshishian said. “And there is a message that says, you can get better, and that it can be difficult, but you shouldn’t lose hope.” 
“Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me” premieres on Nov. 4 on Apple TV+.

I recently saw a TikTok about the Perry Ellis SS93 collection that got designer Marc Jacobs fired. While it was his high magic touch that brought Ellis away from the early ’90s, J. Crew mainstream style and into the world of grunge and pop culture, his collection was reviewed as “ghastly” by British fashion critic Suzy Menkes. 
But what I noticed is that the collection felt almost as if taken out of my friends’ closets:  the same cut of thrifted dresses and the same patterns of brands like UNIF. It was even as if the models themselves raided their older sisters’ closets and more fearlessly layered and mixed up textures and fabrics. 
Still, this feeling isn’t a new one — in fact, I’ve been feeling it grow, like a sprouting pit, in my stomach for quite some time. It’s the same feeling I got when I was browsing Frankies Bikinis and realized that their Estelle Knit Tank was very similar to Aritzia’s Soloist Top, which is incredibly similar to Gigamus’s Mola Tank. And, while not as strong, the exact same feeling came up when realizing that Miaou’s heavenly bodies made me think of Pristine’s Angelyne skirts, which, in turn, vaguely reminded me of Y/Project x Jean Paul Gaulthier’s Body Morph dress.
You get what I’m saying here? 
This feeling is the recognition of a constant repeat with slight tweaks and is truly giving Nathan Fielder’s “Dumb Starbucks.” And I feel frustrated, uninspired and amused all at once because it’s not a surprise in the slightest. 
This is one of the many reasons the trend cycle is called just that: a cycle. Since our generation takes so much inspiration from the past, the cycle feels like it’s never even rotated. The rotation to keep the fashion economy and all of its stakeholders in check is still doing its job, but it feels like it’s spinning so fast that it isn’t even moving anymore. 
So what does that mean for us fashion devotees?
For consumers, maybe it’s time to consider a capsule wardrobe with a few statement pieces. It can be boring, but it’s possible to keep it interesting by mixing up textures, shades and cuts. You don’t have to get rid of all your fun pieces; just learn to experiment and incorporate them into everyday life. And, it’s more cost-efficient in the long run and easier to move around in your endeavors post-college.
For aspiring designers and stylists, we need to keep finding ways to be innovative in non-traditional ways while considering the circumstances of our future. In other words, keep finding ways to look at ordinary things in a new way and be sure to consider what is emerging and dominating — what technology, silhouettes or color schemes.  
In reflecting, maybe it is my fault. I can’t blame the world, especially the fashion world, for what I am feeling because, at the end of the day, they are my feelings. Maybe I feel uninspired and frustrated because I’m not challenging myself anymore. Maybe I’ve grown comfortable in my few outfits on rotation, my fear of the aging closet is beginning to show its effect and my frustration with the trend cycle is only growing stronger — I mean, the trend cycle cannot have a break because of a global pandemic and the forced shutdown of operations. But it needs to have a more purposeful “vacation.”
I think I need to take my own advice and look from a new perspective. Take a breather, take a chill pill and just take a risk. The end of the year is coming up, and just because Halloween is over doesn’t mean I have to stop playing dress up.
Every day is a new opportunity to make a change, so seize the day, Trojans! And look good while doing it.

In 1831, Omar ibn Said completed his autobiography, chronicling the heart-wrenching details of his life, from his beginnings in West Africa to his enslavement in the United States. It is the only known surviving Muslim American slave narrative. 
Nearly 200 years later, Rhiannon Giddens and Michael Abels have collaborated to create an operatic refashioning of Said’s story. “Omar” is a powerful statement of African American culture and identity, drawing attention to stories that so frequently go untold in this country’s history.
Drawing primarily from “The Life of Omar ibn Said,” Abels and Giddens set the opera in two acts, following the titular character from his beginnings in West Africa to his enslavement in Charleston, South Carolina and Fayetteville, North Carolina. Underpinning the entirety of the harrowing story is a theme of faith, whether it be Muslim, Christian or familial. 
In composing “Omar,” Giddens and Abels took a kaleidoscopic approach to style, incorporating as many Black-influenced genres as the opera allowed. Drawing from jazz, soul, hip-hop and much more, the work truly reflects the music of Black America, both past and present. Giddens’ syncretic, genre-bending approach to music is featured heavily, though interestingly, a hallmark of her music — the banjo — is absent. Instead, Abels’ orchestration weaves all of the disparate musical threads through the traditional orchestral palette, giving a sense of cohesion to the otherwise contrasting elements.
As the first act begins, Omar is established as a man of scholarship and faith in the region of Futa Toro in West Africa. Surrounded by an idyllic village and a caring family, his life seems complete and his faith secure. However, the peace of Omar’s life is violently disrupted when raiders arrive, murdering his mother, Fatima, and taking him captive. After enduring a horrific trip across the Middle Passage, Omar faces enslavement in the U.S., resulting in crises of culture, identity and faith.
The titular character is portrayed by tenor Jamez McCorkle, who brings enormous gravity to the role. McCorkle has a commanding stage presence, yet consistently represents Omar’s spiritualism in a manner which centers the entire work. His vocal performance is titanic, lending profundity to even the most skeletal material. Even when in prayer or meditation, McCorkle’s acting demands attention, enrapturing the audience in Omar’s story.
When Omar arrives in the U.S, he meets Julie (Jacqueline Echols) at a slave auction in Charleston. Julie advises Omar to run away to Fayetteville, where they will eventually meet again in the second act. An invented character, Julie’s exact relationship to Omar remains ambiguous in the opera — but her influence catalyzes Omar’s reclaiming of his identity. Echols’ performance is radiant, beautifully filling the tuneful melodies of Giddens and Abels. Her rendition of “Julie’s Aria” in Act Two is one of the most spectacular moments in the entire work.
Though Fatima dies early in the story, she remains with Omar for the entirety of the work, imparting motherly wisdom onto her son. Amanda Lynn Bottoms wonderfully embodies the matriarchal figure with her beautiful singing. Fatima’s reappearance throughout the opera is a reminder of Omar’s cultural heritage and identity, and Bottoms creates an aura of spiritual contemplation with each line.
Daniel Okulitch’s contributions also go far in deepening the opera’s impact. Portraying both of Omar’s enslavers, the cruel Johnson and the (comparatively) more benevolent Owen, Okulitch stirringly recalls the evils of slavery and its effects on African Americans, both then and now. Though Okulitch differentiates the two enslavers in his acting, the unique casting choice of two enslavers to one singer reinforces the universally corrupt nature of slavery.
Outside of the major characters, we often hear from members of the chorus who give individual accounts of slavery which run parallel to Omar’s story. These roles are all stunningly performed, with the cast truly taking ownership of every character. Each performer involved in the production truly breathes their own life into the opera, supplying the music with inordinate power.
Not only do the performers demonstrate enormous devotion to this production, but also the creative team. The staging, designed by Christopher Myers and Amy Rubin, never fails to impress, whether it be the incredible projections employed throughout the work or the use of suspended objects to create scenes like Omar’s Fayetteville jail cell. The costuming by April M. Hickman and Micheline Russell-Brown is gorgeous, subtly complementing the themes of the work.
When Omar comes to the decision to write his story at the end of the opera, every element of the production comes together. The opera takes on a uniquely communal feeling, as the ouroboros-inspired ending again returns to faith. In this LA Opera production, the Giddens/Abels collaboration comes to life, leaving the audience with a message about American culture that is unique in its poignancy and modern relevance. 
Remaining performances for “Omar” are on Nov. 5, 9 and 13. Student Rush tickets are available for $25 on the day of each performance.

In speaking with students on their experiences in coronavirus isolation during the fall semester, the Daily Trojan followed a common thread: students allege that parts of USC Student Health and USC Hospitality seem to be closed overnight and on the weekends, even to coronavirus matters. 
After testing positive for the coronavirus on the first day of classes this semester, Vaughn Hays, a freshman majoring in applied and computational mathematics, was directed to isolate at a hotel until he either tested negative on day six or had been in isolation for 10 days, as per protocol. However, he was unable to conduct that day six test. 
“My ‘day six’ that I’m supposed to be tested on would actually be either Saturday or Sunday, depending on when you count my first day of symptoms,” Hays said. “So I asked about scheduling the test and they say, ‘Oh, we’re closed on weekends.’ So they just don’t give people an opportunity to test on the weekends and come home, which is really insane to me.” 
If someone’s “day six” falls on a Friday, Hays said, and there’s no appointment availability that day, they’d be staying in isolation an additional three days. 
While he said he appreciated the ability to stay in a nice hotel, Hays found the apparent weekend closure to be puzzling.
“It’s just totally unreal,” he said. 
Lindsey Le, a freshman majoring in business administration, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday, Aug. 26. When she tried to get a room at a hotel with USC, she, too, found that certain University services were not available over the weekend. 
“It took the whole weekend for [USC Hospitality] to respond, so I had to isolate myself in the dorm,” Le said. “I live in an apartment with three other people, so I had to just stay in the living room and be very cautious of myself because I did not want to spread it to them.” 
This did not sit well with Le, as the fact that she had to wait for a hotel room in her apartment meant that more people could have been exposed. 
“[It was] like COVID didn’t exist over the weekend,” Le said. “It just didn’t feel super professional.”
Ian Wisecarver, a freshman majoring in aerospace engineering, said his roommate experienced the same situation as Le. When his roommate tested positive for the coronavirus over the weekend, USC Hospitality did not move him into isolation until the school week had restarted. Like Le, Wisecarver thinks Hospitality simply did not respond to the isolation request during the weekend. 
“It was a Saturday and a Sunday that he ended up spending locked in his room because they could not move him to isolation until Monday. Or … they, at least, chose not to,” Wisecarver said. 
Wisecarver remembers having to bring food to his roommate from the dining hall because he was unable to leave the dorm without exposing other students to the virus. 
Wisecarver also said that he experienced an inability to schedule appointments on MySHR — the online student health portal — on Saturdays and Sundays. 
Carissa Liu, a sophomore majoring in public relations, experienced a slightly different, yet similar, issue to what Hays and Le went through. When Liu tested positive, she first tried calling the USC Student Health Hotline, but it was after hours and the only service available was for mental health. She then emailed the University’s coronavirus email and filled out the contact tracing forms, but had to wait to request a hotel room because the form wasn’t open at the time. 
“That form is open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.… It was after 9 p.m., so I waited till the next morning to do it,” Liu said. “That’s probably one of my biggest gripes with [USC’s coronavirus procedures], is if you test [positive] at night, you don’t want to stay in your room because you know you’re positive already.”
Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said Student Health is open on Saturdays and offers telemedicine services on both days of the weekend. She said she hadn’t heard about students’ difficulties moving into hotel rooms over the weekend. 
“I really am not aware of that,” Van Orman said. “That should not be the case. As I mentioned, we do not oversee the isolation housing … when you test positive and you let us know you test positive, we provide you information with where to request a room, and there should not be any delays.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Vice President of USC Auxiliary Services Dan Stimmler wrote about the University’s coronavirus procedures. 
“For the past three years, the University has had COVID-19 procedures that include isolation and quarantine accommodations, working with locations across the Los Angeles area,” Stimmler wrote. “The process is led by an isolation team that works seven days a week, including holidays, to ensure that our students’ needs are met.” 
USC Auxiliary Services is the University arm responsible for USC Hospitality, including isolation services. Stimmler did not address students’ experienced inability to obtain isolation housing over the weekends.

Maria Madrigal, an education program specialist with USC Sea Grant, never considered herself a creative writer. She majored in studio arts and ecological teaching and learning in college. 
“I can write for work and things like that, but I’m not a creative writer, I guess I should say,”  Madrigal said. “I never envisioned [writing] a children’s book.”
Madrigal wrote a book about marine biology for Room to Read’s STEAM-Powered Careers collection. The collection features 10 children’s books about various professions — including oncology, data science and nanotechnology — written by professionals in the field with the goal of increasing resources for kids to learn about careers in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics.
Dieuwertje Kast pitched the collection to Room to Read, a nonprofit organization looking to address illiteracy and gender inequality, in 2020. Kast is the director of STEM education programs for the Joint Educational Project, an organization under the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences that provides the University with service-learning opportunities within the community.   
“We wanted to have a wide variety of different STEM careers, especially some that students may not have ever heard of before,” Kast said about the books in the project.
After pitching the idea to Room to Read, Kast incorporated people from the University into the STEAM-Powered Careers collection. University staff and alumni authored eight of the 10 books, which featured seven additional University scientists. Kast wrote the book about oncology and shared her experiences in the North Pole and South Pole in the book about polar science.
She was inspired to pitch the idea to Room to Read after noticing a lack of STEM children’s books with diverse characters. A 2018 study by the Cooperative Children’s Book Center at the University of Madison—Wisconsin School of Education revealed only 23% of characters in children’s books are people of color. 
The collection stars three characters — Cora, Mia and Jae — who learn about each career featured in the collection. The characters are Black, Latina and Asian, respectively. 
“[Kast’s] ability to elevate voices of people of color within the sciences is just really appreciated,” Madrigal said, referring to Kast’s efforts to share the STEAM-Powered Careers collection with the community. 
Jasmin Sanchez, a USC alumna who majored in health and human sciences, wrote the occupational therapy book in the collection. She said the collection empowers students to pursue their dream careers. The characters listen to advice, try new things and learn from wrongdoings to overcome challenges. Sanchez said she hopes to pursue a career in occupational therapy and participated in occupational therapy research at SoLa Peace Camp when she was a student.
“I think it’s very important to bring awareness to [occupational therapy] not only for students who may want to pursue it as they get older, but also if they need the services that occupational therapy can provide,” Sanchez said. 
The STEAM-Powered Careers collection features digital and print copies of the books in both English and Spanish. The digital version of the collection is available to read for free on the Room to Read website. The website also includes hands-on lesson plans and educational videos for each book.
“You can definitely see a child light up when you talk bilingually or [when] you explain something to them in Spanish that they’re having difficulty understanding in English,” Sanchez said.
Room to Read funded the STEAM-Powered Careers collection and provided 90,000 books to schools and education programs in the community. 
Kast also organizes book assemblies at elementary schools to share the stories with students, which authors from the collection attend to read to the community. After the book assemblies, students are able to bring an English or Spanish copy of the book home. 
“It’s been really great to see [the books] in the hands of kids, because they get excited,” Madrigal said. 
Madrigal said her favorite parts of working with the STEAM-Powered Careers collection were creating the storyline and visuals for the book and meeting some of the scientists and authors involved in the project. 
Sanchez said she hopes the collection makes children feel confident in pursuing the career of their choice. 
“I want [students] to know that they can do whatever they want to do with their lives,” Sanchez said. “They can pursue any career, any pathway, and they’re going to be amazing and they’re going to do great.”

The USC Gould School of Law celebrated the 52-year career of former dean and professor Scott Bice with more than 200 colleagues, alumni, staff and friends at the California Club in Downtown Los Angeles Oct. 27.
During his 20 years as dean, Bice established 25 endowed faculty positions, increased the law school’s endowment from $6 million to more than $100 million, and completed three fundraising campaigns. He and his wife, Barbara, continue to support many causes at Gould, particularly the Public Interest Law Foundation — now known as the Barbara F. Bice Public Interest Foundation.
At the event, Bice expressed his gratitude for the “great privilege” of teaching and following his students’ careers in a myriad of legal professions, including private and public service practice, the judiciary, education and elected office. 
“My colleagues on the faculty are a splendid group of scholars and teachers who exemplify what an academic community can be. Thanks to all of you for making our time at the law school so rewarding,” he said.
Colleagues and former students alike spoke throughout the event, detailing Bice’s influence at the law school and in the classroom, as well as his special talent for connecting with those around him.
Matt and Erin Matzkin, both USC Gould alumni, spoke about the influence Bice had on them during their time as students — and how close they’ve remained since, including Bice becoming ordained to officiate their wedding.
“As afraid of Scott as we all were as students, at a party, he brought out everybody,’’ Matt said. “We wanted to be his friend, we wanted to be on the same level as him in the conversation, and Barbara, we wanted to know everything about them.”
Gould School of Law Dean Andrew Guzman also announced the naming of the Dean’s Suite, at Gould as the Scott H. and Barbara F. Bice Suite, during the event, saying that Bice greatly influenced the alumni he taught, as well as the faculty he worked with and mentored.
“That legacy lives on in the lives and careers of thousands of graduates and in the culture and dynamism of the law school he did so much to shape,” Guzman said.

As the calendar turns to November, there couldn’t be a better time to be a sports fan in America. The NBA and NHL are finally underway, with the NFL currently in the thick of it. Despite that, the Holy Grail of world championships reigns supreme. The 118th edition of the World Series — MLB’s crown jewel — has finally, painstakingly arrived. Thankfully, the Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies have brought the heat.
I’m no magician, but my postseason bracket might say otherwise. For starters, I knew Houston would torment their American League peers, and boy did they, avoiding a single playoff loss through the first two rounds. With that, the Astros secured their fifth pennant in franchise history — and fourth since 2017 — thanks to a four-game sweep over the New York Yankees. With the American League Championship Series victory, Houston has now eliminated New York in the postseason for the fourth time in the past eight seasons. Unlike 2017 or 2019, however, this series was won without the usage of banging trash cans or buzzers under the jerseys. At least, as far as we know.
I’m especially proud of my Phillies pick, however. Who knew listening to blind ambition could take you so far? Speaking of Philadelphia, they seized the National League pennant over the San Diego Padres in five games, embarking on their first World Series trip since 2009. Designated hitter Bryce Harper captured the NLCS MVP as well, with his game-winning home run in Game 5 all but guaranteeing the award in his honor. During the postgame press conference, Harper declared, “We’re gonna bring this s— home, boys,” echoing his plans for the team when he first stepped foot in a Phillies uniform in 2019. With his bat in the lineup, the Phillies stand a chance against anyone. If Harper delivers on his pledge, I can’t even begin to conceive the level of chaos Philadelphians would wreck on the city streets. Amidst all the chaos, Harper would never have to pay for a cheesesteak in Philly again. 
Here we are, halfway through the series as of Nov. 2, and Philadelphia holds a 2-1 series lead. I briefly touched on this in my last column, but I’d like to double down on my championship pick. The Astros are an impending wall of doom, a baseball machine with no remorse for what stands in their wake. The Phillies are, well, let’s say “scrappy.” They have reached the precipice of the sport itself — now two wins from immortality — but fate has reared its ugly head. The bullpen lacks depth, the starting pitching tandem of Aaron Nola and Zach Wheeler can only take them so far and half the lineup has stopped producing. That didn’t stop Philadelphia from prevailing in Game 1, clawing and scratching their way to a five-run comeback victory in Houston. However, Game 2 told a different story, with the Astros pulling away in the first inning and never looking back. Game 3 was all Phillies, a 7-0 smackdown amidst an absolutely electric Philly crowd, edging the Astros closer and closer to the blade.
I’m not backing down. Despite all that, it’s far from over. A Game 3 rainout on Monday pushed the series back a day, allowing for Nola to seize an extra day of rest and setting him up for a Game 4 start against Houston righty Christian Javier. A shaky start from Nola (4.57 postseason ERA) would spell a 2-2 series tie, and suddenly the series becomes a best of three. Game 5 will likely be Houston’s Justin Verlander’s second start of the series and, despite his World Series struggles in the past, would set the Astros up well to capture the title in Game 6. Someone like third baseman Alex Bregman will land World Series MVP, and Houston will prove the haters wrong and win a legitimate title for the first and only time.
Do I hope this happens? Genuinely, no. Major League Baseball is at its best with a high level of parity and unexpectedness, with a sprinkling of underdog thrown in. The Atlanta Braves downing Houston last year after the midseason loss of their best player was an incredible story. The Chicago Cubs coming back down 3-1 to the Cleveland Indians in the 2016 World Series was breathtaking. Houston back in the World Series yet again, looking to add another trophy to their collection that started just five years ago, is simply not fun for me.
To sum it up, I like to think the Phillies represent the whims of the public. The out-of-nowhere contender, fueled by a pure competitive fire up against the tyrannical dynasty, only a few years removed from a major cheating scandal? Sounds like a movie to me. Unfortunately for myself and most of the country, the reality is often cruel. Houston is destined for greatness, and there’s nothing we can do about it.
With the Astros securing yet another title, the 2022 Major League Baseball has reached the tail end of its lifespan, and another excellent and emotionally-charged year for baseball is in the books. A year chock-full of milestones, records and all sorts of incredible moments deserves recognition. Over two years removed from the pandemic that put a pause on the baseball world, the nation’s pastime finally found its footing in one of the most noteworthy years in recent memory.
While championships are sealed in the fall, they are truly won in the offseason. In my next edition, I’ll discuss some of the biggest moves that will undoubtedly make (or break) ball clubs in 2023 and beyond.

After a hard-fought regular season of soccer, USC will face its biggest challenge yet and a litmus test for their potential NCAA tournament run in their matchup against the No. 1 UCLA Bruins — a team that has been ranked number one in the United Soccer Coaches Poll for nine consecutive weeks — on Friday. 
The No. 14 Trojans swept the state of Washington last weekend, beating the Huskies 2-1 on Thursday and the Cougars 3-2 on Sunday. Against the Huskies, the Trojans opened the scoring early, but Washington equalized the match in the 43rd minute. Senior midfielder Croix Bethune’s eighth goal of the season broke the deadlock five minutes later and won USC its 10th game. Playing Washington State in a matinee thriller, the Trojans made a comeback from down 2-1 after junior forward Angeles Escobar’s 53rd minute equalizer and sophomore forward Simone Jackson’s 64th minute winner. 
First-year Head Coach Jane Alukonis was proud of her team’s effort and ability to win both tightly contested games.
“We faced some adversity on Thursday and just overall on the weekend with how physical the other teams played,” Alukonis said. “I’ve been proud of the way the players have played. I think overall just the ability to keep the ball, fight through tough moments and find a way to win was just awesome.” 
Alukonis is no stranger to UCLA; she previously served as an assistant coach at the university before coming over as head coach of the Trojans. She detailed her excitement ahead of the match.
“[It’s] always a massive rivalry,” Alukonis said, “Obviously last year, it came down to the Pac-12 title. I think a win against them would position us really well in the tournament, but also just a testament to the team we are and the work we’ve put in this season.” 
As for any advantages Alukonis can bring the Trojans as an ex-Bruin, she dismisses that notion and describes UCLA as a well-rounded team.
“I think everyone across the Pac[-12] is fairly familiar with opponents,” Alukonis said. “Obviously, working with a lot of the players that are playing now, you know them well, but soccer is a funny game and you never know what each player is going to do each day.”
“Reilyn [Turner]’s had a really good year, Sunshine [Fontes]’s done really well, LB [Lauren Brzykcy]’s a great shot stopper and I think overall they’re just solid in each position.”
According to Alukonis, to cap the regular season off with a win, the team needs to stay grounded and play the way they’ve been doing so all year.
“Sometimes we just get tested by other teams or face tough, physical, direct opponents,” Alukonis said. “I think we’ve just got to stay strong mentally, and in how we play as well, stick to our game plans and make sure each day we’re doing our best in practice, but also taking care of our bodies.”
In Alukonis’s first year as USC’s head coach, the team started off slowly with a loss to Purdue University, but quickly rebounded and now sit third in the Pac-12 with 23 points. Though a win against UCLA will not win them the regular season championship, a win could prevent rivals UCLA from winning it themselves. And when it comes to her first year in charge post her UCLA tenure, Alukonis described the season as rewarding, yet challenging. 
“It’s been awesome,” Alukonis said, “I know it’ll continue to be awesome. I’m just really proud of the players and what they bring every day. Challenging, I would say, the pressure of being a head coach at times, but I’ve been really proud of how the players have played, what we’ve displayed on the pitch and generally proud of the results.”
USC will take on UCLA Friday at 2:00 p.m. at home at McAlister Field in a match that can determine the Pac-12.

Don’t take breathing clean air for granted — on campus or in Los Angeles County. In light of the coronavirus pandemic, lung health has received more attention in the past couple of years. But beyond the coronavirus, there is another ongoing pandemic that jeopardizes lung health: the use of flavored tobacco — a significant health concern among American youth.
Flavored tobacco products have a well-documented history of being extremely addictive and a pipeline towards nicotine addiction for many young Americans. These flavors, often candy or fruit-based, play a large role in contributing to youth smoking addiction, with the Food and Drug Administration claiming that 70% of underage smokers use e-cigarettes  “because they come in flavors I like.” Moreover, the use of flavored e-cigarette products has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with 84.7% of e-cigarette consumers using flavored e-cigarettes, a 20% increase since 2019. 
While California law bans the sale of tobacco and e-cigarettes to individuals under 21, studies have proven that the current age restriction on purchases is ineffective. For instance, the 2021 National Youth Tobacco Survey showed that 48.6% of adolescents do not purchase tobacco and e-cigarette products themselves, indicating that youth acquire products through older friends and family. The L.A. City Council responded to these concerns in early June when they passed a comprehensive ban on flavored tobacco products within the city. In the upcoming general election on Nov. 8, California voters will have the opportunity to expand L.A.’s protections to the entire state through Proposition 31. It is imperative that voters pass Prop 31 to protect youth from these highly addictive tobacco products. 
Prop 31 is designed to stop the sale of products that are extremely addictive for underage smokers, while also allowing adults who would prefer to keep smoking to do so. The proposition bans tobacco products with added flavors; however, it does not ban the sale of loose leaf tobacco, hookah, cigars and other products that contain tobacco flavor.
Those who are not in favor of the proposition often argue that a ban of flavored tobacco would create an illicit underground market that would be even harder to regulate. Empirical evidence, however, suggests the contrary. A peer-reviewed study conducted by the American Cancer Society found that Nova Scotia’s 2015 ban on menthol, a minty flavor additive, decreased illicit menthol purchases by over 80%. The success of Nova Scotia’s menthol ban suggests that California should adopt a similar one.
Opponents of the proposition also argue that enforcing such a ban would hurt California’s economy. However, when examining the healthcare costs of smoking, Prop 31 would actually benefit the economy. According to a University of Illinois study, a ban on flavored tobacco could save Californians $423 million in healthcare costs annually, including $144 million in Medi-Cal savings that could be used elsewhere to benefit California taxpayers.
Big tobacco companies use candy-like flavors to hook the younger generation into lifelong smoking addiction. With the cost of these addictions amounting to several hundred millions of dollars annually and the youth vaping crisis in California continually growing worse, statewide policy action is desperately needed. If you wish to protect Californian youth, vote “yes” on Prop 31 by Nov. 8.
If you are struggling with a smoking or vaping addiction and want to cut down or quit, contact USC Pharmacies’ Tobacco Cessation Program. Call (213) 821-6100 or visit pharmacies.usc.edu/services/ to learn more about this affordable and confidential program.

Did you know that USC has a vending machine that sells pregnancy tests, off-brand Plan B, tampons and other sex-related items? It’s the product of a partnership between USC Pharmacy and USC Student Health. Located in King Hall across from the Lyon Center, the vending machine offers a wide variety of other general health-related products as well. Even the off-brand Plan B is cheaper than both the name brand and off-brand version sold at Target — at the vending machine, it costs $22 while it costs $46.99 at Target. 
Although it’s great that the University has managed to come up with a creative and more cost-effective way for students to access these important resources, there has been little to no publicity about the machine. With a student population of over 49,000, it’s astonishing that so few know the machine exists. And, it’s even more astonishing that only one exists for the entire campus.
This concern comes with the ending of USC’s first-ever Sex Week. The week was filled with forums, conversations and even a sex therapist. The thought was there, but it’s more important for the school to implement these resources around the clock rather than simply pouring all their efforts into one over-the-top showboated week. 
It’s rather strange for the University to put so much effort into an initiative like this only for nothing to be promoted properly. In fairness, the machine was established right before the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, so it’s possible that the publicity wasn’t able to reach its full potential before everything was shut down. Nonetheless, it wouldn’t take too much effort for either USC Pharmacy or Student Health to send out an email that reinvigorates awareness.
The accessibility of this machine promotes a message that it’s okay to have sex, and that it’s okay even to make mistakes as a result. The discreteness of the vendor as a machine rather than a person can also provide a world of comfort for someone already in a difficult situation. It’s an incredible concept — so why not flaunt it? And on top of that, why not place more machines in more locations around campus and in USC Housing?
Colleges cannot assume that young adults entering their campuses already understand the nuances and precautions of having sex. Contrary to popular belief, students are not as sexually active as everyone may think they are. And while that is more than okay, it comes with a lack of knowledge that universities such as USC must understand and address. 
For some, sex is still an uncomfortable topic to discuss, and while Sex Week is great for those wanting to learn more about their sexuality, it can leave more apprehensive students at a standstill. Regardless of a student’s experience, discourse and events like Sex Week should always include reliable plugs for valuable resources.
Having access to safe sex-related items can be as easy and accessible as grabbing a Coke from a vending machine. But with only one machine on campus and only one dedicated week to broach the topic, ensuring students understand safe sex is not truly being pushed in a meaningful capacity.
It would be in the student body’s best interest if more of these health-related vending machines were erected in more locations. It’s not fair for the only one to be set in an area not central to the rest of the school. And with the establishment of more machines, there should be a great deal of coverage alongside it. 
With an increase in these machines, it could be possible that both Student Health and USC Pharmacy wouldn’t be flooded with as many questions or appointments dealing with sex-related incidents, freeing up time and resources for more pressing issues. At the same time, students could be saving themselves between $20 to $30, as well as the rather strenuous ordeal of asking a Target employee to unlock the box with the Plan B. It’s an all-around win.
