For the USC men’s basketball team, nothing is better than playing at home. The Trojans overcame a 15-point second-half deficit to defeat the Colorado Buffaloes 79-72. The win moved USC to 15-0 on the year at the Galen Center.
Guard Jordan McLaughlin scored a career-high 25 points to go along with five assists and four rebounds. Fellow backcourt mate, Julian Jacobs finished with 17 points, five steals, and two heart-pounding dunks, one of which was a reverse finish on a fastbreak.
“I just wanted to get the crowd going.” Jacobs said on the dunk. “It was a huge momentum shift. That dunk put a statement on our run and got the crowd into it. It’s hard to play in Galen when the crowd is involved like that.”
Behind 11 straight points from McLaughlin, the Trojans ended the game on a 34-12 run. The Buffaloes went on eight-minute dry spell from the field until guard Xavier Talton hit a 3-pointer with 10 seconds left in regulation.
The Buffaloes bullied their way to a huge advantage on the boards, out-rebounding the Trojans 37-21 for the game. The rebounding numbers were a season low for the Trojans.
“Their guards would blow by ours on the closeouts, and even if they missed the shot, their bigs would slide onto our guards and get the offensive rebound,” head coach Andy Enfield said about Colorado’s rebounding advantage.
USC jumped out to an early 14-9 lead behind the strong play of McLaughlin and Jacobs. Behind their bench, the Buffaloes responded with a 9-0 run that saw them take a four point lead.
An and-one dunk from Jacobs pulled the Trojans within one, 20-19. Colorado responded by ending the half on a 17-10 run to take an eight point lead into the half.
The Trojans were out-rebounded 23-11 in the first half. A strange turn of events happened after a missed free throw from Colorado’s Wesley Gordon. Forward Nikola Jovanovic failed to box out, leading an infuriated Andy Enfield to quickly sub him out for seldom-used Strahinja Gavrilovic. Jovanovic returned less than a minute later.
The Men of Troy came out of the half fighting. Back-to-back steals led to a vicious reverse slam from Jacobs that capped a quick 5-0 run to start the second half. The Trojans had numerous chances to cut the lead to a single possession but failed to convert from the free-throw line.
For the next five minutes, everything that could go Colorado’s way did. Bricked jump-shots led to easy offensive rebounds. Blocked shots went right to Colorado players under the basket. Off-balance 3-pointers to beat the shot clock went in. By the end of it the Buffaloes pushed their lead to fifteen, 60-45.
At the  time, Colorado was shooting 64 percent from the field in the second half. Enfield responded by switching to a 2-3 zone. The Buffaloes would miss their next eight shots from the field.
“Coach put an emphasis on defense.” McLaughlin said. “Coach said we were going to win with defense, and we did. It was a great call by coach [to switch to zone].”
The Men of Troy went on a 20-5 run that tied the score at 65. McLaughlin scored 11 straight points that helped put the Trojans up by five with under two minutes left to play. The Buffaloes would never threaten again.
McLaughlin and Jacobs finished with over half of the Trojans points, seven of their nine assists, and a combined nine steals.
“[McLaughlin and Jacobs] controlled the game down the stretch with their penetration, shot making, and defense” Enfield said.
Forward John Scott led the Buffaloes with 17 points and guard George King chipped in 13 points and nine rebounds. Colorado’s bench outscored the Trojans’ 37-15.
USC’s win snapped a seven game losing streak to the Buffaloes. Next up for the Trojans is a Sunday afternoon game against the Utah Utes. Tip off is set for 3 PM and will be aired on Pac-12 Network.

As the baseball team prepares to open its season this Friday, the loss to eventual national champion Virginia in the NCAA Regional Final still lingers. Yet, that extra-inning loss in Lake Elsinore has only provided more motivation for a talented Trojan roster.
“The preparation [for 2016] began in the summer when we lost to Virginia,” junior catcher Jeremy Martinez said. “Everyone is going to remember that feeling.”
The Trojans’ 24 returning players got to work over the summer and through the fall, and now, Martinez said the team was chomping at the bit to finally start the season.
“A lot of guys came back in shape, a lot stronger, and a lot of pitchers came up with better velocity,” Martinez said. “So I think the preparation is there. Now it’s just time to showcase all that hard work.”
Martinez is one member of a strong nucleus of players returning for the Trojans in 2016. Although USC will undoubtedly miss stalwarts such as Bobby Stahel, Garrett Stubbs and Dante Flores, who combined to account for over a third of USC’s hits in 2015, there is a wealth of returning talent both in the batting order and on the mound. Senior infielder AJ Ramirez and senior outfielder Timmy Robinson paced the team in home runs last year, swatting nine and seven, respectively. Pitching-wise, senior Marc Huberman earned six wins in 2015, while senior Kyle Davis tallied six saves (both figures led the team). In fact, two picks from the summer’s MLB First Year Player Draft return to USC this season, including Davis (29th round, Blue Jays). Senior pitcher Brent Wheatley was selected by the Oakland A’s in the 17th round.
But regardless of how much talent the Trojans lost, or how much talent is returning, head coach Dan Hubbs simply wants his players to push themselves to improve.
“They don’t have to replace those numbers,” Hubbs said. “They just have to continue to get better. All these guys are going to get more and more opportunities. We need them to be able to just do their thing.”
Hubbs was also very happy with the less experienced players he called on to step up in place of the graduated and professional Trojans.
“We think there’s a lot of talent there,” he said. “Whether they’re guys who were in the program who are now getting a bigger opportunity or the guys that are just coming in the program as freshmen.”
USC looks forward to a tough schedule in 2016. The Trojans face long road trips for series at TCU, Oregon, Washington State and Arizona State, while Cal and Oregon State highlight this season’s home series. They will also compete in the annual Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic, taking on Oklahoma and Mississippi State at Dedeaux Field before battling archrival and defending Pac-12 champion UCLA at Chavez Ravine.
The Trojans play nine of their first 11 games at home, including their first two games in the Classic, in series against North Dakota, Korean Baseball Organization franchise NC Dinos, and Wake Forest.
USC was ranked No. 12 in the nation in this year’s D1 Baseball preseason rankings — the first time in a decade that the school has cracked the top 25 to start the year. Ask around the team, however, and there is very little fanfare or self-congratulation regarding the achievement.
“We were unranked for the first three years, and then we’re ranked now,” Davis said. “I guess that’s kind of cool, but it really doesn’t mean much till the end of the year.”
Hubbs agreed with his veteran pitcher. After all, his program has the most national championships in NCAA history.
“The expectation at a place like USC is that you’re competing for a national title each and every year,” Hubbs said.
Hubbs, who signed a multi-year deal over the offseason after an impressive first three years at the helm, was excited to see his team take the field in 2016.
“As long as we play our game and do what we’re capable of doing, then I don’t think it matters who we play,” Hubbs said.
For now, however, the team’s focus is squarely on its season opening series against North Dakota, which starts on Friday at Dedeaux Field. Kyle Davis will toe the rubber for the Trojans on Opening Day, and first pitch will be at 6 p.m.

This past weekend, I had the privilege of running in the 2016 Los Angeles Marathon and after months of rigorous training and preparation, I’m happy to say that I successfully completed the 26.2 mile trek. There are only few feelings that measure up to crossing that finish line after running a race that stretches from Dodger Stadium in Chavez Ravine all the way to the Santa Monica Pier.
The sweetest part of it all, though, was not the finish line. Rather, it was the journey getting there. As German aviator Dieter F. Uchtdorf famously said, so often we become so focused on the finish line that we fail to enjoy the journey. While the finish can be rewarding, the journey and everything you learn along the way is unrivaled.
But it took me nearly 10 miles into the race until I realized how lucky I was to be running alongside 25,000 or so other individuals from diverse backgrounds. Some ran, some walked and others were racing to qualify for a separate marathon, but even while almost everyone was running for different reasons, all shared one common goal: to cross that finish line at some point in time.
Throngs of supporters lined the entire route with signs of encouragement, while thousands of volunteers handed out fluids, snacks and high fives throughout the duration of the race. So many different people played a tremendous role in making sure I had an unforgettable experience and I’m thankful for that.
I’m glad that I decided to live in the moment and take everything in during my first marathon. It was ever so gratifying, however, to take a look back at the extended journey that led up to it — one that began back in August when my training partner and I decided to take on a bucket list item after running just a couple miles on a trail by the beach.
Over a four-plus month training period that commenced back in early October, those two or three miles along the coast turned into weekly 10-milers around campus, 15-plus mile runs along the boardwalk in Santa Monica and Venice Beach and a number of long-distance strolls in the both the Midwest and Pacific Northwest.
If there’s something I learned looking back, it’s that one can train their mind to do just about anything, anywhere, anytime so long as they’re committed to some sort of means to an end. For a lot of athletes, though, it’s easy to get caught up in always looking ahead to that end goal and forget about what was right in front of us at a specific point in time. It’s a seemingly never-ending trend that extends beyond the finish line.
Now that I’m pretty sore and I’ve achieved the milestone I set out to accomplish, I can’t stop thinking to myself: now what? After countless hours of preparation, conditioning and recovery, it’s nearly impossible for me to just sit around, bask in glory and call it a day. I truly believe that it’s the natural tendency of all athletes to always be thinking, “on to the next one.” This is why the concept of enjoying the journey is a lot easier said than done. It is vital, however, that we at least acknowledge the pathway to our eventual success in whatever it may be in life, aside from athletics — that’s a major key.
The journey is something beautiful, foiled by the blood, sweat and tears that were present throughout my training. Crossing that finish line is a culmination of the fruits of your labor, but it’s always important to remember what got you there: who, what, where, why and how? The answers to those five basic questions served as my compass throughout the arduous process and provided me purpose, as they do for many other athletes competing regularly in their respective sports.
At times, especially in a world full of distractions, it was tough to not only endure but enjoy the pain and adversity en route to the finish line, but I’ve discovered that it’s this sense of passion and persistence that builds character. Having dealt with these emotions, I feel like I’m mentally stronger. I’m just hoping that I will take more time to relish in the process because I’m just getting started.

After a challenging weekend against the University of South Florida and the University of Florida, the No. 11 Women of Troy return home to Marks Stadium Friday in a nonconference match against the No. 1-ranked Cal.
The Golden Bears are undefeated on the season, and have moved up to No. 1 in the rankings after winning the ITA National Women’s Team Indoor Championship. The Women of Troy had a commanding 6-1 win over USF with the lone loss due to a retirement from Rianna Valdez. The next day was a different story, with Florida, a team many consider the favorites for the national title, completing a 7-0 sweep against the Trojans.
USC will be playing its first match in the newly renovated Marks Stadium, which was dedicated and officially completed on Tuesday. Both the men’s and women’s team received upgraded locker rooms as well as meeting rooms and lounges. For fans, canopies were added across the seating area to provide shade, and new entrances enhance the aesthetics of the stadium.
Coach Richard Gallien noted the difference between his team this year and last year at this point.
“We got to the top of the nation quickly, but there was always a bulls-eye,” he said. “[This year], we are the hunter.”
Cal comes in strong with four players ranked in ITA’s top 125, but USC counters with five. The Golden Bears have the two top-ranked players in the matchup, senior Klara Fabikova and junior Maegan Manasse, ranked an impressive fifth and 13th in the nation, respectively. Freshman Olivia Hauger and junior Denise Starr come in ranked 102nd and 121st, giving the Trojans a challenge across the board for singles. In addition Cal will try to get on the board early with the second-ranked doubles team of Manasse and Starr, which will be a difficult task for the 11th-ranked USC team of senior captain Giuliana Olmos and sophomore Gabby Smith.
The Trojans will be up for the challenge, with five players ranked in the top 100 this week. Olmos leads the way for the Women of Troy at No. 38, followed by sophomores Madison Westby at No. 62 and Smith at No. 87. Two freshmen also cracked the rankings: Rianna Valdez and Jessica Failla at 90 and 95. Junior Zoë Katz will likely be the sixth Trojan singles player to complete a solid lineup.
“Playing on a team is a new deal [for the younger players] … and although we have the right type of character, there is still some adjustment,” Gallien said.
The skill levels of both teams should bring an exciting match for fans between two of the nation’s top teams and the two teams at the top of the Pac-12 standings last season. Last season’s matchup between these two teams resulted in Cal’s only loss in the conference on its way to a 9-1 Pac-12 record, falling short only to the 10-0 Trojans in a thrilling 4-3 USC victory.
“We have a motivated and positive group that is focusing on what we can control and trying to get better day by day,” Gallien said.
While Friday’s contest is not a conference match, a win would be crucial for the Trojans’ confidence in their quest to repeat as Pac-12 champions for the 11th straight time, and jump back into the top 10 rankings.

As the vote-counting process dragged on, Andrea Parra grew nervous. As one of 240 Dornsife faculty members who voted on whether non-tenure track faculty in the school should unionize and one of the few who stayed to watch the votes being counted on Feb. 2, Parra was waiting to hear that the vote would swing in favor of unionization — but her optimism shrank as time went on.
“To me it was immediately obvious that the vote wasn’t going our way,” Parra said. “It was neck-and-neck the entire time, so we were kind of sitting on pins and needles.”
A strong supporter of unionization, Parra said she was “disappointed” when the vote results came in and Dornsife faculty decided against joining the union, SEIU Local 721, by a vote of 127-113. Parra, an associate professor of Spanish in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, has been teaching at USC for 17 years, and sees unionization as an important step toward righting many of the wrongs adjunct faculty face at the University.
“I think that we should be allowed to participate in determining what’s in our contract,” Parra said. “The administration makes a lot of decisions for us that limit the kind of professional development we can engage in and the kind of research that we can do.”
The vote was a cause for celebration for some adjunct faculty members at the Roski School of Art and Design, however, including Patrick Jackson, one of 31 faculty members who supported the successful unionization vote over the six faculty members who were opposed. For Jackson, a lecturer in Roski’s sculpture department, being part of a labor union is a move towards greater job stability, which he sees as especially important for artists.
“I’ve always had a fear of a class being canceled at the last minute and the possibility of losing health insurance and income with no kind of option to make that up,” Jackson said.
Teaching contracts are decided on a semester-to-semester basis, and as a result, Jackson could never be sure whether he would have a job the next semester, an issue that he hopes will be solved with the new vote to unionize.
That stability is something Parra and other Dornsife non-tenure track faculty are seeking, as well as a greater sense of transparency in the contract negotiation process. According to Parra, issues such as faculty salaries and teaching schedules are currently decided on an individual basis, which deprives faculty members of the bargaining power they would have as a collective unit.
“[Salary decisions are] a unilateral process,” Parra said. “Every year we receive a salary letter that lets us know what we’ll be making the following academic year, and if you are not satisfied there is an appeal process, but many people don’t know that that process exists. Even when you do appeal it, you just send it off and don’t know who’s viewing it or what the process is.”
In an email to USC faculty on Feb. 2, Provost Michael Quick explained that he was “personally disappointed” in the vote at Roski, and that the University plans to appeal the results on the basis that faculty members are managers who cannot unionize. However, the University will not contest the results of a vote at the USC International Academy, which supported unionization 32 to 3.
Quick also expressed a willingness to work together with Dornsife faculty to address some of the issues that spurred the push for unionization.
“I do not take lightly the fact that the Dornsife vote was close and that a substantial number of faculty expressed their dissatisfaction by their votes,” Quick wrote in the email. “The decision of the Dornsife faculty to reject unionization leaves us free to continue to work collaboratively within the university community on the issues that are important to faculty, building on what we already have achieved.”
Dornsife faculty, however, contested the results of the vote, alleging that USC officials had interfered with the process by promising to meet some of the faculty members’ demands and threatening that unionization would prevent them from participating in university governance. The complaint, which will be investigated by the National Labor Relations Board, named several emails sent out by Quick as the vote approached, which urged faculty members to reconsider their stance on unionization.
These emails may have contributed at least in part to the vote results, according to Parra, who said that 26 to 28 percent of eligible faculty members — defined as those who had taught in Dornsife the previous semester, were not tenured or on a tenure track, and were not teaching online classes only — did not vote, despite the guarantee of anonymity.
“Even though it was an anonymous vote, I think people are very fearful of being identified as having voted for the union,” Parra said. “I think that some people were still on the fence, and I spoke to some people who were happy that the threat of the union was already provoking change.”
Although Parra sees the voting results as a setback, she remains hopeful that it can be reversed in the future, as Dornsife faculty can file for another vote as early as November.
In the meantime, promises from administrators to address faculty concerns may make some changes — but Parra remains skeptical that these will hold any substance.
“I think we have to be vigilant that they make significant changes, so that people don’t forget about the injustice and lack of transparency that we’ve suffered over the years,” Parra said. “I’ve been here 17 years, and I’m not going to forget.”

The Price School of Public Policy’s Associated Students of Planning and Development hosted Planning for College on Wednesday, an event where high school students learned about urban planning and gained insights on the college admissions process.
The event was held from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. ASPD members in Price’s Master of Planning program organized the activities and led 42 visiting high school sophomores through a series of exercises and informational seminars.
The day began with an introduction from ASPD president Benjamin Frazier  and an address from Price professor David Sloane, who teaches courses in urban planning, policy and history and community health planning and policy. After the welcome, students participated in an activity in which they mapped out their own neighborhoods and schools, examining why these places are organized the way they are.
Following the neighborhood mapping, the high school students broke up into small groups and rotated between three different activities, including a “Before and After” exercise, where they matched old photos of different areas with their current counterparts to observe changes over time; a “Streetmix!” activity during which students designed their own street layouts and a Price admissions information session. Students engaged in a capstone activity where they designed their own cities using the tools and skills they gained throughout the day.
ASPD coordinated the event with GEAR UP 4 LA, a federally funded program that aims to help low-income minority high school students successfully graduate and enter college. The participating high schoolers came from the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools, located in the historically underserved areas of Koreatown and Pico-Union.
“[Planning for College] is meant to be an introductory seminar to let students know about planning as a career and show  them how they can get involved in their community even if they aren’t planners,” Frazier said. “Most urban planners didn’t know about planning when they entered college, so we just want to show high schoolers that planning is a viable career option and that it affects many aspects of their lives, while also incorporating college preparatory aspects.”
Justin Pascone, ASPD social chair and event volunteer , said that the Planning for College program merges city planning and life planning.
“At Planning for College, we try to combine the ideas of planning a city and planning your life,” Pascone said. “We show them how to set goals and achieve them through planning, which applies to both urban planning and college preparedness and bridges the gap between the two.”
Participating high school students also commented on what they learned, as well as their new interests in urban planning.
“It was really cool to learn about our neighborhoods now and what they looked like before, and seeing how they’ve changed over the years,” said Joshua Valdivieso, a sophomore at Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools.
Students also discussed different aspects of the college admissions process.
“I learned about how numbers, like GPA and test scores, aren’t that important and that it’s more about what you do and how you help other people,” said Sage Cuza, a sophomore at Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools. “It’s also not about making yourself look good on paper, but about doing what’s important to you.”

USC hosted the second Campus Climate Open Forum, which discussed profiling, safety and the Department of Public Safety, Wednesday at the Davidson Conference Center.
Issues from the previous forum included how USC will increase diversity in staff and students, address sexual assault cases and increase transparency from President C.L. Max Nikias. Some students were upset that Nikias did not attend the event.
The second forum focused on following the lead from universities like Harvard and the UC systems on racial profiling, sexual assault and transparency from the Provost.
DPS Chief John Thomas wants not just USC to be safer, but the community outside of the university as well.
“The community outside of USC idolizes us. I idolize us. We need to take action in not only helping kids, but with businesses and homeless advocates. We need to create the opportunity for engagement,” Thomas said.
Taj Frazier, a professor in the Annenberg School of Communication, raised a question on how to engage with young students outside of the USC community.
“How do students get introduced into the outside neighborhood? We have students,” he said. “Our purpose as a university is to find alternative representation to engage with the outside community.”
Juan Antonio Cordero Vasquez, a senior majoring in psychology, said that racial profiling is rooted in the enduring legacy of white supremacy.
Leslie Berntsen, a student organizer for the Campus Climate Coalition, is an advocate for victims of sexual assault and believes sex education is a great way to bring awareness to this issue.
Berntsen said that the University should offer students comprehensive education on sexual violence prevention and intervention.
Cynthia Wang, a graduate student in engineering management, attended this event to see what the issues are going on around campus.
“Some of the issues were stuff I never thought about before, as an RA, I am able to bring awareness to the community,” she said.
The next campus climate forum will be held March 9 in the Vineyard Room of the Davidson Center.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Leslie Berntsen said that the University should educate students on “sex and communication.” She said sexual violence prevention and intervention. The article also stated that Juan Antonio Cordero Vasquez is a member of the RISE Student Alliance. He is not. He also said that racial profiling was rooted in the legacy of white supremacy, not “relevant due to history,” as the article previously stated. This post has also been updated to reflect that Berntsen is an advocate for victims of sexual assault, not sexual assault. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

Marshall School of Business professor James O’Toole, founding director of USC Jerry and Nancy Neely Leadership and Ethics Institute, spoke about the values system of a democracy and its implications on American politics at Mortar Board’s Last Lecture Series on Wednesday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
O’Toole has been named one of the “100 most influential people in business ethics” by the editors of Ethisphere, and one of “the top 100 thought leaders on leadership” by Leadership Excellence magazine.
O’Toole started the lecture by saying that when he was young, he felt that he had a strong understanding of politics.
“I thought I understood what was going on in the world, particularly in regard to what was happening in government and politics,” O’Toole said.
He eventually realized, however, that he didn’t understand why people supported certain politicians.
“You try to make sense of who you like, and why you like the person,” O’Toole said. “There are all these debates. They seem very chaotic. No matter what you believe, how do you make sense of it?”
O’Toole went on to state that in a democracy, people make decisions based on their own personal values. He specifically sorted American values into four categories: liberty, equality, order and community.
“[Liberty] is a value that Americans in particular hold more dear than any other value,” O’Toole said. “Freedom or liberty. No one thought about liberty the way we think about it prior to 1620.”
He noted that this value conflicts with another American value — that of equality.
“If everyone is equal you are going to have chaos,” O’Toole said. “It was a long time before people began to value equality in society. However, if you want equality of outcome in society, this value of liberty is going to get in the way.”
He said that order is an important mediator between the two values.
“Any sensible person would trade off liberty and equality for a well-ordered society,” O’Toole said. “Order, to a lot of people, is the very highest value.”
But O’Toole also said that a sense of community was important for any democratic society to work.
“Aristotle said a just society is a society where every single individual can make a contribution to his or her society,” O’Toole said. “This notion of community then, really has to do with environmentalism and humanism.”
He then applied these values to politics, stating that most politicians derive their perspectives from these four core values.
“Almost every single politician today is reflecting one of these value sets. It is a shorthand for a broader idea of what they believe,” he said.
O’Toole said that these conflicting values can stall a country’s progress when applied to a political system.
“There are several problems,” O’Toole said. “Whose value is right? There are people with competing values who have made it almost impossible for society to move forward. Nobody is getting what they want.”
O’Toole ended the lecture by reminding the audience that backing a candidate doesn’t necessarily mean that the candidate will uphold the values of the people who voted for them.
“The problem is that democracy doesn’t guarantee anything,” O’Toole said. “All it guarantees is that you have a voice, nothing more than that.”
Allison Bajet, a senior majoring in print and digital journalism, said that the lecture really helped her think critically about the values that America has based itself on.
“I felt it was very informative. I never really thought about the values of our society,” she said. “It was very interesting for me. I really liked how he laid out the four pillars that our presidents used to create a just society.”

How often have you heard a friend say something like, “I had an urgent meeting at 2 a.m. in the morning,” or “It was unexpectedly surprising when my sister gave birth to a pair of twins”?
Here, what does 2 a.m. mean if not morning? What is a surprise if not unexpected? What are twins if not a pair? These redundant phrases are called pleonasms, meaning the use of more words than are necessary for the expression of an idea.
However, sometimes a writer may intentionally use a pleonasm to convey an idiomatic expression or to emphasize a particular idea. For example, phrases like “tuna fish” and “safe haven” are idioms in English. Hence, in written language, removing words not strictly necessary makes writing seem awkward at times, especially if the words are cut from an idiomatic expression. On the other hand, excessive use of pleonasm weakens writing and speech; words distract from the content.
The bottom line is, most writing should be concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.

In the rapidly expanding EDM industry, producer/DJ duo Louis The Child has been on the rise. Members Robby Hauldren and Freddy Kennett, natives of Chicago, have seen recent success with their new single “It’s Strange” and their subsequent national tour.
The duo has become very popular despite their young ages — Hauldren is a freshman majoring in music industry and Kennett is still in high school. However, Louis The Child often performs in clubs they would otherwise not even be old enough to enter. In April, the duo will complete their first national tour with performances at Coachella.
Robby Hauldren sat down in an interview with the Daily Trojan to talk about Louis The Child’s beginnings and the road ahead.
Daily Trojan: What initially sparked your interest in music, from an early age?
Robby Hauldren: I grew up in a very musical family. My dad plays a lot of guitar, and I have a lot of other family members on my dad’s side who sing in operas and are, like, singer-songwriters. My dad would always play guitar and make up songs about my siblings and I growing up. [Music] was just sort of always there, and I always wanted to be like my dad.
DT: How did Louis The Child start?
RH: [Kennett] and I originally met at a Madeon concert. We both happened to go to the show and had mutual friends there. My friend turned to me and said, “Hey, this is Freddy.” That was it, but after that we talked more on Facebook. I was making mashups under the name Haul Pass, and Freddy was producing under the name Fatboy. We were both just kids in our area that were really into electronic music and wanted to do something with it, and we decided to get together and work on stuff. We had a lot of similar interests and influences and we enjoyed working on stuff together.
DT: What would you say some of those interests or influences were?
RH: I’d say the biggest influences for Louis The Child would be Madeon, Flume, Porter Robinson and Odesza. Early on we were super influenced by electro-house people — way back we loved Dada Life, but our influences have changed.
DT: Where did the name Louis The Child come from?
RH: We went on Wikipedia and hit the random article button a couple of times, then Louis The Child popped up and we thought, “Yeah, that sounds good and we went with it,”
DT: EDM is an umbrella term representing many kinds of electronic music. What would you say the style of Louis The Child is within EDM?
RH: I really couldn’t tell you where our [style] fits because our sound is pretty broad, but it still feels like it’s cohesive. People might put us under the future bass category.
DT: How do you and Freddy split up your work? What is your group chemistry like?
RH: We both came from different backgrounds. I came from more of a DJing background and when I was making mashups, I was doing it through DJing and live mixing. Freddy came from more of a production background, actually using a [digital audio workstation] to make music. After getting together, we started to cross paths more with DJing and production. It’s getting better.
DT: Who do you like to listen to? Any particular bands or artists?
RH: I’ll listen to anything but country. It’s always changing, but I’ve been floating in and out of a Phish phase lately. Currently, I really dig Chance the Rapper.
DT: What do you think caused the song to be so successful?
RH: The song was very catchy and had more of a pop appeal, and it was an original song so that added some more meaning. We put in a lot of work behind the scenes trying to set up a big premiere for it. Taylor Swift posted a picture of songs she was really into, and “It’s Strange” was on it. Then Lorde tweeted out the lyrics to the song not too long ago. We put in a lot of work to get it out to as many people as possible.
DT: You guys are on a national tour. What have been some of the highlights so far?
RH: I think one of the coolest things so far is that we’ve been able to sell out the last 10 shows, including the Canopy Club in Urbana, which is way bigger than any venue we’ve played before. It was a huge success for us, especially because we’ve opened for the Chainsmokers and Madeon there, so coming back as a headliner and being sold out was really cool. And just seeing the amount of people who want to come out to our shows and all the people who sing lyrics to our songs.
RH: Have you ever received negative feedback, and how do you deal with that?
DT: We don’t pay too much attention to that. Kids are gonna hate and say what they want. If someone says the song just sucks, we don’t let it get to us. If someone has a compelling point, then sure we consider it, but in the end we know we’re confident with what we’re producing.
DT: How are you able to balance music with school?
RH: It hasn’t been too bad. I’ve manipulated my schedule to have certain days off and I find time for Louis The Child when I can. Freddy is a year younger than me, so he needs to finish up high school. Then he’s going to move out to L.A., and I’m planning on taking a leave of absence after this semester to work with Louis The Child full time, which I’m very excited about. We’ll see where things go.
DT: You guys are booked for Coachella. How did you get that gig?
RH: We have a booking agent that tries to get us gigs. He told us a while back that he was trying to get us Coachella. One day he sent over an email and said, “Hey, here’s the offer from Coachella. Let me know if you want to do it.” Obviously you say yes to that. When I saw the email, I was in my dorm room and I screamed! I had gone the past two years with my sister, and I have always considered it a dream festival to play.
DT: What are your immediate goals for LTC?
RH: We have an EP that we’re finishing up right now; we’re thinking probably about five songs. We’re trying to release a single for it before Coachella, but we still don’t know the exact timeline on it. We hope to do more touring this summer and in the fall.

With winter slowly coming to a close, everyone is getting ready for the next season: not spring, but Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 3 fashion collection that debuted last Thursday at Madison Square Garden in New York City. His Adidas collection not only showed off his latest clothing line, but his latest album titled The Life of Pablo. The 38-year-old rapper turned fashion designer showed gratitude to Adidas, the guest stars on the album and his family for supporting him in his bold career move.
The venue featured two raised platforms for plenty of remarkable models to stand on, such as English model Naomi Campbell and Ethiopian model Liya Kebede, while 1,200 extras stood in the pit underneath. The new looks, although similar to the previous Yeezy Season 2 collection, provide fans with a colorful sensation as splashes of maroon, orange, rose and yellow were interspersed in the show, especially in the new Yeezy Boost 350 shoes with side stripes.
The Yeezy Boost 350 has been spotted on celebrities and West’s close friends such as The Weeknd and Tyga, not to mention the entire Kardashian-Jenner family, who are in support of his transition into the fashion industry. Just last year the remarkable sneaker label was named the “Shoe of the Year” at the 29th Footwear News Annual Achievement Awards ceremony.
According to GQ magazine, West’s acceptance speech spoke about what it means to be an artist: “As a creator, it doesn’t matter how big your house is, how big your name is, how much money you have, your job is to create while you’re here and if anyone is in the way of that, if anything gets in the way of that, you got to burn it to the f–ing ground.”
Aside from the iconic shoes, which are promised to be sold at a lower price, both menswear and womenswear emphasize the classic muted color scheme of black, gray, beige, cream and olive green while promoting  warmer tones. The vibrancy of West’s collection illustrates the passion he has for both his musical and stylistic work. With the highly anticipated release of The Life of Pablo, he is ready to claim 2016 as the “Year of Yeezy.”
Yeezy Season 3 presented an almost entirely black cast of models that highlighted some of the cooler tones in the collection, whereas Yeezy Season 2 featured a predominantly white cast of models who were camouflaged within the nude pieces of the line, not to mention the actual camouflaged patterns from both seasons.
The shapeless cut of the men’s collection paired with the slim fit of the women’s line emulate West’s own effortless style. Despite his exquisite taste, Yeezy Season 3 deviates from cliché luxe attire and promotes a brand that is simple, yet distressed in telling the story of the creator. In consideration of his unconventional upbringing, the latest collection discloses what the world assumed West to be as a college dropout: ragged and unkempt. However, The College Dropout singer is making a name for himself through this aesthetic that represents who West is today as an artist in both the music and fashion industry: headstrong and confident.

Angry. Hairy. Man-hating. Feminist. For one of my earlier articles for this column, I received a lot of hate, most of which contained a combination of those terms. As I watched the comments pop up underneath the article, I was filled with a strange mix of disgust and happiness. How dare these people who clearly know nothing of feminism accuse me of such things? It would’ve been more upsetting had the hate comments not put the article in the popular section for days, which they did. I felt vindicated and tried to move on with my life. However, being the anal-retentive person that I am, I couldn’t stop thinking about it.
I am a feminist. I am angry. Man-hating? Never, except for the occasional ironic misandry and my Male Tears mug. As for hairy? Hell. Yeah. Let me explain why.
This past weekend, the Museum of Contemporary Art hosted the Los Angeles Art Book Fair. Hundreds of people were packed into the cavernous space, peering at subversive art and generally enjoying the air of anti-establishment that pervaded the scene. Everyone seemed to be high on the somewhat secret thrill that came with rebelling against  life through art. There was really good coffee, too, as most hipster scenes tend to have.
Rather than be a responsible quasi-adult and control myself, I bought more zines than anyone could possibly need, and put my name down for every mailing list I came across.  There were many, many feminist artists present. I noticed a pattern. Several tables had at least one zine, magazine, pamphlet or other medium expressing their dissatisfaction with the popular construct of the hairless woman. Even artists who were not necessarily hardcore feminists had addressed the issue, whether seriously or satirically.
Girls grow up being told that body hair is disgusting. Television ads show women shaving or waxing their already hairless legs. In stores, epilators and shavers are always tucked besides the tampons and pads — that dead zone which walking up to almost feels like being a soldier marching into battle. Mothers make appointments for their 12-year-old daughters to have their eyebrows plucked and barely there mustaches removed.
It’s almost as though the world is not allowed to know that women do in fact grow hair on places other than their heads. The truth is, body hair on females is not shameful.
Selfish Magazine, which is a self described “mostly memoir magazine” based in Los Angeles and Brooklyn, tackles body image and hair in its second issue, “Just One More.”
“Mom allowed me to tend to my eyebrows, maybe because they were part of the way I presented myself to the world. They should be well-groomed. Clean eyebrows could influence anyone I meet,” writes Kelsey Nolan in her piece, “From the Eyebrows Down for Selfish.” Nolan continues, “Everything else is for the consumption of those I choose.”
Isn’t that the crux of things? Social conditioning of women dictates that everything a woman does with her body is for the general public.
“Get in the shower. Wash, squeeze, exfoliate, massage. Tack the long, wet loose hairs from your head to the shower wall, lest they clog your drain. Shave. [Once you start, you can never stop],” writes Nolan, perfectly depicting the arduous routine of making oneself presentable according to society’s standards.
In “Let’s Talk About Body Hair,” a collaboration zine directed by Glamour Girl, artists such as Mia Lucci and Shahrnaz Javid combine striking images of female body hair with quotes about shaving.
Underneath a picture of two girls with pubic hair, Lucci writes, “I still get comments from guys that say things like, ‘Ew, you don’t shave, that’s gross,’ … It’s like damn, why would you ever think what I do with my body has anything to do with what you like?”
In “Female Fuzz: A Rant” by Shahrnaz Javid, she writes, “I don’t think growing out armpit, leg or pubic hair needs to be a feminist statement by any means at all … Female fuzz shouldn’t be progressive or forward thinking, it’s biology, organic, natural.”
Some feminists choose to dye their armpit hair pastel pink. Some revel in showing off their hairy legs in shorts, others prefer to be smooth like a baby’s bottom. I believe it is important to recognize that all these choices are valid because they’re choices made by women who refuse to succumb to societal pressure.
P.S. The pink tax is totally real. At CVS, a set of three men’s shavers cost $7.49. In comparison, a set of three women’s shavers (so-called because of their pink and purple colours) cost $13.99. Both are the same brand, but somehow women end up paying more!
P.P.S. Women derive no joy from the process of removing hair. Waxing hurts and a day or two after shaving, the cactus-leg effect comes into play when stubble starts growing underneath the skin. Ouch!
For more readings about why female body hair shouldn’t be an issue, I recommend the zines mentioned in this article, as well as “Static Zine Issue #11” by StaticCloud on Etsy, “Girls Don’t Do That” by Girls Don’t Zine, as well as “Ripley Zine” and “Grrrl Asylum,” both of which can be found on tumblr.com.

Sorry, but there is no such thing as “ironic hatred of men”.  Would you accept “ironic misogyny”?  “Ironic racism”?  “Ironic homophobia”?
I am endlessly fascinated by the mental gymnastics of misandrists  who attempt to hold forth on “equality”…while simultaneously justifying their own bigotry.   
In simpler terms-this is the “do as I say, not as I do” mentality.
In my day, we had a word for that.
Hypocrisy.
A matter of taste. Noorhan’s habit is valid and her right. Yes, it will likely limit men’s interest in her to those who are not turned off at seeing hairy legs or armpits. That is Noorhan’s choice and no decent person should deny her that or attack her tastes. Likewise, if she is Muslim, she may choose to wear a hijab, concealing most of her head and neck or even a niqab, leaving her only a viewing slit at the eyes. That too, is her choice. If this is unconventional in the US, that is fine. She is hurting no one by her personal grooming practices.

In a nation currently battling epidemics of obesity, heart disease and diabetes, it’s time that hospitals and schools feel obligated — not just incentivized — to provide healthy dining options.
A piece by The Atlantic written by gastroenterologist Dr. Shilpa Ravella last week underscored a simple point — having hospitals house fast food chains doesn’t send the right message. The same, however, goes for universities like USC, a school that not only shoulders responsibility for 43,000 students, but also staffs the internationally acclaimed Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and oversees one of the nation’s largest teaching hospitals, LAC+USC.
Putting students and patients first means making nutrition a priority. Though nutritional advice is available at the Engemann Student Health Center, the University needs to show genuine care through concrete changes on all its campuses.
Let the national medical front cast hope. In a survey of 208 hospitals last winter, the Physicians Committee found that 20 percent housed fast-food restaurants on their campuses, a high statistic that is set to decline. And in a major move last December, Allina Health declared that it would no longer offer any sugar-sweetened beverages or deep-fried foods in its 13 hospitals and over 90 clinics across Minnesota and Western Wisconsin.
Universities should also not be overlooked. Students tend to base decisions on a youthful sense of invincibility. Though it’s impractical to ban all fried foods on campus, having healthier options is doable.
For students and the surrounding community, it’s no secret that eating mindfully is difficult. After all, for a tour that hits virtually every fast food chain imaginable, one only needs to walk a few blocks down Figueroa. Jack in the Box, Carl’s Jr., McDonald’s, KFC, Panda Express, Taco Bell and Domino’s Pizza are all stationed within walking distance, landmarks of a “food swamp,” a term used to describe an area with an abundance of fast food restaurants and convenience stores. Even though a Panda Express already existed within a mile from main campus, another opened at Ronald Tutor Campus Center and yet another on the Health Sciences Campus, bringing fast food even closer to students. At California Pizza Kitchen, food isn’t much healthier, with salads averaging over 700 calories, and pizzas at over 1,000. The sandwiches, salads and yogurt parfaits offered at Seeds seem healthy, but when it comes to disclosing nutrition facts, the University hasn’t made a move. Under the nutrition info tab on USC Hospitality’s site, it still says, “Coming soon… until then, make wise choices!”
Students also need to be better educated about nutrition in general. Many students I know skip meals, forget them entirely or grab fast food and go. However, most can afford the time and money to prepare real food. It’s the idea of cooking after a long day that seems to deter this practice. As Mark Bittman of The New York Times wrote, “Taking the long route to putting food on the table may not be easy, but for almost all Americans it remains a choice, and if you can drive to McDonald’s you can drive to Safeway…  The core problem is that cooking is defined as work, and fast food is both a pleasure and a crutch.” Nutrition is the must for day-to-day physical and mental performance, especially when it comes to school.
Making it a little easier for students to do that should be a priority for the University. After all, people can be educated and motivated, but if the environment isn’t conducive to growth, nothing can happen. On top of the mountain of stress that students constantly deal with, an environment that encourages junk eating is one that’s “obesogenic.”
Dr. Barbara Natterson-Horowitz says it best in her 2012 book Zoobiquity. She opens with a scene she stumbles upon early one morning: “French fries wilted in their own grease on paper plates holding burger scraps and ketchup smears. A yellow bag of M&Ms gaped open beside a gutted sack of Doritos.” The catch: “This wasn’t a frat house on Sunday morning or a bulimic’s bedroom. No, this was the on-call room used by the overnight team of a cardiac care unit.”
The best way to hack this side of human nature is to instigate a change in environment. Hospitals and schools that refuse to do that are neglecting important responsibilities.
At USC, efforts to install healthier options have been in the works. With places like the juice bar Nekter next to the School of Architecture, the University is taking steps in the right direction. Initiatives such as McCarthy Quad’s weekly farmers market, which was introduced in 2013, are part of a positive trend. With the University Village set to unveil in fall 2017, hopes are that the new developments maintain a healthy momentum.

In what has been dubbed the “Bunnygate” scandal, Mount St. Mary’s University has recently made headlines for firing teachers who opposed a student retention plan. When private equity and entrepreneurial expert Simon Newman was appointed the president of the small private Maryland university in 2015, his goals included greatly expanding the institution’s dwindling endowment and doubling enrollment. Perhaps his most controversial proposal, however, was his strict student retention plan, which has ignited a national debate about intellectual freedom and moral responsibilities of an academic institution.
According to the Washington Post, at Mount St. Mary’s University, 20 to 25 percent of freshmen leave without finishing the first year. To curb the high dropout rate, Newman hoped to identify and dismiss struggling students within the first few weeks of the semester to avoid tarnishing the reputation of the university. The retention program and subsequent fallout demonstrates the discord between a university’s administration and the needs of the faculty and students. This underlying discrepancy reveals the core dilemma of how academic institutions are structured and, more importantly, where students and faculty fit into this system.
The Mountain Echo, the university’s newspaper, published evidence supporting the questionable actions of Newman’s retention plan, ensuing controversy on campus. The articles in The Mountain Echo quoted Newman saying “You just have to drown the bunnies . . . put a Glock to their heads.” His insensitive metaphor urges professors to be firm with their students and weed out those that are at risk of ruining the university’s reputation. Rather than help new students adjust to the demands of higher education, he chose to preemptively remove those that initially had difficulty meeting the rigors of academic life.
Following the university newspaper’s initial release, the advisor to the school’s publication, Edward Egan, and a tenured professor who had spoken out against the retention program, Thane Naberhaus, were fired without severance pay and without notice. Such actions spurred national outcry, in which professors from universities nationwide signed a successful petition to reinstate the professors. Since the release of this petition, a new petition for Newman to resign has also been released.
With a diverse student body and faculty, USC should recognize the infringement on academic freedom revealed by the Mount St. Mary’s scandal. For universities to succeed and encourage innovation, there must be a respect and mutual understanding between the students, faculty and the administration. Silencing those who question the appropriateness of plans regarding student education diminishes the purpose of the inclusive community small universities advertise. Students applying to private institutions seek an increased access to faculty and greater decision-making in their education. Private enterprise-style management clearly does not promote the same ideals. Without freedom of expression, academia defeats its purpose. Its growth becomes stagnant.
Moreover, the high number of signatories on the petition for reinstatement demonstrates that the national academic community supports the professors and believes it is unjust for an administration to prohibit constructive criticism.
Perhaps the underlying issue is that private financiers support academic institutions. This dependence subverts the integrity of a liberal education and prioritizes economic gains over educational growth. Newman was appointed to improve the economic situation of the university, and thus naturally his strategies emphasized changes that would help grow the endowment.
The profit motive can lead to a disregard for the well-being of the students and faculty. For students at USC and private institutions in general, it is important to ensure the integrity of the administration’s intentions. Rather than focus on reputation and endowments, the administration should work to facilitate an environment that allows for dissenting voices conducive to a truly great education.

The opening of Windowspace was held at the Lindhurst Gallery in the Roski School of Art and Design on Monday. Windowspace is a prototype of a studio space, long wanted by the Roski students that will allow them to collaborate and work together on projects.  
Roski seniors Steven Rahbany, Kristine Ortega and Megan Park developed the idea of Windowspace. They decided to use the gallery in an unconventional way and plan to have other events like the screening of an art film and a round table, where the seniors could advise the freshmen. 
“One thing that frustrated us in the last four years was the limited space at Roski, Rahbany said. “You can only have access to a studio if you are in a class. So, we came up with this idea of what if the gallery turned into a space that helped the needs of the students? That’s why we split the gallery in half, where one-half is like a centralized area where the students can congregate, and the other half is for them to do their work.” 
Park said that the idea behind creating an exhibit was to showcase the utility of a space such as this to Roski.
“One of the biggest problems that the Roski students recognize is the lack of community area and a studio space for after hours,” Park said.  “We converted this normal gallery space into a student lounge where we got in our furniture, and we wanted to showcase what it would be like for Roski as an art school to have a space like this.”
The Windowspace aims to create opportunities that are community-based, providing students with a central space or student lounge where they can relax, work or just hang out.
“Since the year started we have been working on developing the Windowspace, and it has been really fun. I can’t believe it’s real, and I hope that students use this,” Ortega said. “One of my main roles was thinking about what art students want to see on the walls. We are planning on having art students draw and interact with these windows so that it becomes more of an interactive and engaging space.”
According to Jeff Cain, lecturer of design at USC, a prototype is very important for any object design, and Windowspace is one such prototype of a social space that can be used by students. 
“Prototypes can be a way to start a conversation,” Cain said. “What I liked about their idea is that they decided to use this existing gallery as a prototype for their project. I think it is like a performance in which the administration is right across the hallway, and they can see how this will be used.”
Andrew Jiang, a freshman majoring in computer science, thought that a similar structure would benefit other majors. 
“It’s a great concept and is really unique. I actually want such a space for Computer Science students to code together,” Jiang said. “Like a dedicated space, apart from classrooms, for specific interests.” 
Sean Hnedak, a senior, majoring in fine arts, felt that this exhibit could serve as a benchmark for future student projects.
“This is my first impression, and I think it is really awesome. If I imagined a student space here, it would be like this,” Hnedak said.
Windowspace will be on view until Feb. 25.

While we’d all like to claim that we’re adventurous in our food endeavors, there are times when we cannot help but let our basic cravings get the best of us. We put our search for all foods new and exciting on hold, and indulge in food that is painfully cliché, yet greatly satisfying. If you’re ever feeling exceptionally basic, any of these five foods on campus are sure to hit your sweet spot.
1. Grilled Cheese from Lemonade
What’s more basic than an excessive amount of cheddar cheese wonderfully melted between two pieces of bread? Only a few things. What’s more satisfying? Nothing.
2. Mac ‘N Cheese from Lemonade
Tired of judging yourself for being overly dependent on those little cups of Easy Mac? The Mac ‘N Cheese from Lemonade is the perfect judgement-free alternative that provides the same comfort and satisfaction. (Note: The White Truffle Mac ‘N Cheese is another great, less basic option). 
3. Caesar Salad from Seeds. 
Scared off by the unfamiliar honey sriracha sesame ginger vinaigrette or just not in the mood for slices of mandarin oranges in your salad? Sometimes, salads from Seeds can be just a little too exciting if you’re in the mood for something simple. The caesar salad is an easy solution to your problem. Croutons and Caesar dressing have never been known to overwhelm anyone.
4. Trojan Bowl from Nekter
While there are always acai bowl options that are more adventurous than the default strawberry banana smoothie, the combination of granola and fruits on top of an extra thick smoothie is still a refreshing, simple choice. The Trojan Bowl is the most simplistic of all other acai bowl options available at Nekter, and my personal favorite. 
5. Pepperoni Pizza from California Pizza Kitchen
If you’re sick of dining hall pizza, CPK’s pepperoni pizza is a great alternative. But if meat isn’t your thing or you’re feeling something even more basic than a pepperoni pizza, then the Traditional Cheese Pizza is about as simple as it gets.

The Undergraduate Student Government announced that USG Program Board Finance Director Edwin Saucedo and USG Director of University Affairs Austin Dunn are the winners of their presidential election during Tuesday’s Senate meeting.
The Edwin-Austin ticket received 2,328, or 63.1 percent, of the votes, a 41 percent margin of victory over the rival ticket Charlie Henriquez and Cole Pham. Their ticket gained 834 votes, or 22.6 percent of the total.
Newly elected USG President Edwin Saucedo was excited over his win and thanked his supporters.
“We’re really excited for what’s to come, and we’re grateful for all the support we got from everyone and from our campaign team. We’re just happy to enjoy this moment,” Saucedo said. “I think opening our student government to the student body to show that we’re working for the student body. We need to make a difference to all of USC.”
Saucedo’s running mate and new USG Vice President Austin Dunn was proud of the win despite a lower than expected voter turnout. He highlighted the transparency of their campaign as a key to their victory.
“The voter turnout was a little bit lower than we expected, but we did as hard as we could,” Dunn said. “We ran a clean campaign; we were true to ourselves the entire time, very transparent, so this is just the icing on top of the cake. I’m super stoked for next year.”
Saucedo and Dunn expressed gratitude for their campaign team and supporters.
“Getting the team was the hard part, and getting a team that represented the whole student body or at least tapped into different communities. We don’t want it to look all the same,” Saucedo said.
Henriquez was satisfied with his campaign.
“It is what it is. I think we ran a great campaign,” Henriquez said. “We definitely stood out. We brought a different campaigning method to the student body. We ran hard; we called out everything we needed to call out.”
The senatorial election results were also announced during the meeting. The ballot options changed this year; instead of voters choosing three greek senators, three commuter senators and six residential senators, the constituencies were discarded, and senatorial candidates ran uncategorized.
The 12 Senators elected out of 20 candidates were Daniel Million, Paul Samaha, Josh Lurie, Daniel Newman, Kate Oh, Tyler Matheson, Alanna Schenk, Sabrina Enriquez, Tiffany Lian, Emily Lee, Tingyee Chang and Leena Danpour.
Samaha promised to continue his advocacy for students and support issues in the face of an unresponsive administration.
“I’m excited to continue working on the projects I’m advocating for and also bringing some new projects to the forefront of USG,” Samaha said. “To make sure mental health and college affordability remain two issues we students continue to press the administration on.”
Results were announced by Associate Director of Election and Recruitment Logan Dallas. Dallas said 3,700 votes were cast this election. In last year’s election, 6,027 votes were cast. Despite this, she said she wasn’t concerned about voter turnout.
“I’m excited for all the candidates that ran. It takes a lot of courage and a lot of work to do this; I’m really proud of everyone regardless of whether they got elected or not,” Dallas said. “Voting is down, but the passion of the people running is up, so I think they’re going to continue this trend of student engagement and making sure issues matter to students.”
Current USG President Rini Sampath was nostalgic over the process and had a positive outlook for the future of USG.
“I’m so excited for candidates that participated; it’s an exhilarating experience in and of itself, and of course for the candidate who won,” Sampath said. “I know it’s an incredible feeling to put all this work into something and reap the reward. I’m hopeful for the future of our organization and to see this kind of engagement from our campus.”

Constance Wu, the actress best known for playing the matriarch of the Huang family in ABC’s television series Fresh Off the Boat, spoke about what being Asian American means, her role in the sitcom and her opinions about Hollywood typecasting Tuesday night in Bovard Auditorium.
The Asian Pacific American Student Association hosted the event, which was part of the signature speaker event for its 2016 Asian Pacific American Heritage Festival.
Fresh Off the Boat, a show run by School of Cinematic Arts alumna Nahnatchka Khan, is one of the few television series on a broadcast network to feature a predominantly Asian cast. The series is based on the memoir of the same name by Eddie Huang.
In 2014, Wu was cast as Jessica Huang, Eddie’s pragmatic mother who wants her children to be successful and also keep in touch with their Chinese heritage.
The conversation began with Wu talking about how she got involved in acting from a young age and how her upbringing in Richmond, Virginia, influenced her to pursue a degree in acting at the State University of New York-Purchase.
“My friends started doing plays … and when I became a teenager, I started to think more about it as a career,” Wu said. “Theater people are like open-minded family people, where people are encouraging creativity, art and all these other things. It was a safe thing to try out as a kid.”
Wu also talked about how her childhood contrasted with the upbringing Eddie Huang portrays in his novel.
“I had a different experience than he did,” Wu said. “Racism was not a thing in Richmond … our neighbors were really open and inviting — baking muffins and inviting us to parties.”
When asked why there aren’t many Asian Americans on television or in movies, Wu explained that there was racism in casting studios.
“We have our ideas of what romantic ladies look like,” Wu said. “Why can’t an acne-ridden girl or a fat girl be cast in the role for The Notebook?”
Wu emphasized that this institutionalized racism unfairly stigmatized minorities, correlating this to the portrayal of foreign accents.
“Hollywood has made the French accent a sexual thing and the Chinese accent a clowny thing,” Wu said. “There’s nothing shameful about your heritage, but Hollywood has made it shameful.”
Despite all the racism placed upon Asian-American actors, Wu said that she has not always been  typecast throughout her career.
“Some of my roles before Fresh Off The Boat were not stereotypically written for Asians,” Wu said. “I was a futuristic space traveler in one, and I was a pothead stoner in another!”
As for the future of Fresh Off The Boat, Wu told the audience that she has no control over what the screenwriters write.
“I just hope that they keep writing great stuff!” Wu said.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Fresh Off the Boat was the first television series on a broadcast network to feature a predominantly Asian cast. The show was preceded by ABC’s All-American Girl, among others. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
