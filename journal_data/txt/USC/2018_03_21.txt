March Madness is the time of year when the country’s most talented college basketball players have a chance to make a name for themselves, get noticed by NBA recruiters and bring home the national championship for their colleges. In the college basketball market — a multimillion dollar industry — NCAA schools make loads of profit off ticket sales, merchandise and television rights. And as they pocket the cash, the yearly question arises: Do the college players, the pawns of the industry, deserve to be paid?
There is certainly a strong case for why they should be compensated for playing college ball. USC, among other schools, was sanctioned by the NCAA for paying at least $2,000 to two of its players’ families. Based on the current rules, this is a violation. But perhaps it shouldn’t be. Schools should not be forced to pay their college athletes, but they also should not be penalized for choosing to do so.
While many support the compensation of college athletes, there is substantial division regarding whether these players should have the right to form labor unions. Students should negotiate their packages independently. It’s a simple free-market example: the best players will choose to go to the schools that offer them the best deal, and students will have the power to choose which school and which package works best for them based on their different needs.
All student-athletes have different, specific goals and expectations from prospective schools. Due to such variations among players, it is clear that unionizing college athletes would be inefficient. A union is necessary to organize a collective bargaining system that protects the rights and interests of a like-minded group. But among college athletes, there is no like-minded group. There are inherent differences in mindset among college athletes, and organizing them into one group would be a mistake.
The root of the issue lies in the title “student-athlete.” This label implies that all players are students first, primarily interested in their schools’ academic services such as obtaining a degree. It implies that they are only secondarily interested in being athletes. While this may be true for some athletes — especially those who play in lower division college sports or players who know they are not skilled enough to make a career in playing professional sports — it most certainly is not true for the stars of nationally ranked teams.
In fact, the vast majority of college athletes who are drafted to the NBA or NFL do not complete their undergraduate degrees. They leave school early and never look back. For true athletic stars, college classes are a hindrance rather than an opportunity for education. If the NCAA allowed it, they would go straight into the professional leagues and dismiss college altogether.
That said, the title “student-athlete” and the academic tuition scholarship that comes along with it are ideal for other athletes. These athletes do not see college classes as a hindrance for their athletic careers because they know they will not play their sport professionally. These student-athletes are more interested in the “student” aspect, and their objectives are to earn degrees. They use their sport as a marketable tool for admission, and taking away these students’ academic scholarship and replacing it with compensation would not benefit them.
Although the NCAA takes a similar position regarding the unionization of college athletes, it does so for the wrong reasons. The NCAA states that it does not employ athletes because students attend college first and foremost for an education and participation in college athletics is voluntary. Both of these reasons are not necessarily true.
First, participation in college sports is not exactly voluntary. The NBA struck a deal with the NCAA to make sure that players are only eligible to play professional basketball at the age of 19, at least one year into college. To be eligible for the NFL, a player must be out of high school for at least three years. This is not true for other professional sports. In tennis, for example, a player can sign a professional contract at 13.
Additionally, we know the NCAA does not employ its athletes, but perhaps it should. Since participation in college sports is mandatory for athletes of certain sports before they sign professional contracts, their primary purpose of attending college is to pass the time before they go pro.
Employees deserve to be justly compensated for the money they generate their employers. But players deserve to decide if they want to be employed as athletes or if they want to be enrolled as students. If both of these groups with different interests join together in forming a union, it would be March every month of the year: pure madness.

Heavy rain didn’t dampen the excitement at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on the evening of March 10; Orpheus and Eurydice, the highly anticipated collaboration between the L.A. Opera and the acclaimed ballet company Joffrey Ballet, was set to debut that night.
Christoph Willibald Gluck’s 1762 opera Orfeo ed Euridice has been remastered by Hamburg Ballet’s artistic director John Neumeier, who accorded it a contemporary context. The characters Orpheus and Eurydice have been plucked from the ancient Greek myth and plunked down in the modern era, even though, incongruously, they retain their archaic monikers.
Act I begins with Orpheus (Maxim Mironov), an exacting choreographer, running through rehearsals for his brainchild The Isle of the Dead. His impetuous wife Eurydice (Lisette Oropesa), the company’s prima in more ways than one, arrives late, and they quarrel. She slaps him, leaves in a huff, then promptly gets into a car accident and is killed.
Orpheus enters a delirium of grief, but his assistant Amour (Liv Redpath), dressed down in jeans and sensible shoes, delivers a sliver of hope, informing him that the gods, moved by his tears, have granted him a second chance. Here, the storyline enters familiar territory for those acquainted with the myth; Orpheus can resurrect Eurydice if he leads her out of the Underworld without even a fleeting glance.

Orpheus enters the Underworld without batting an eye at the Furies, who initially live up to their name but are eventually placated by Orpheus’ calm conviction and saintly suffering. They grant him entrance to Elysium, an afterlife utopia of beauty and serenity. The doomed lovers are reunited, but Eurydice, resentful of his cold shoulder, waxes melodramatic over his perceived indifference. Finally, Orpheus can no longer hold back and rushes to her, only for her to perish once more. Her second death is hardly a spoiler, of course, but witnessing Orpheus’ steadfast lack of communication and Eurydice’s emotional manipulation heighten until they collide and culminate in tragedy — one can’t help but wish the two had attended a few couples’ counseling sessions.
While Orpheus and Eurydice may be the leads, the Joffrey corps de ballet often inadvertently steals the show. The dancers appear in a variety of contexts: as regular dancers, clad in legwarmers while stretching their feet and marking steps, a charmingly meta reproduction of an actual rehearsal; as the Furies, sporting thorny headpieces, blackened eyes and stony expressions, their movements, lunging and desperate; as the heavenly, ethereal beings that glide tranquilly through Elysium in gauzy white tunics; and back to themselves, attired in verdant performance ensembles as Orpheus’ vision of The Isle of the Dead finally comes to fruition.
Inspired by Arnold Bocklin’s painting of the same name, the set design is also a work of art. One of the most striking moments of the show is when the Furies introduce themselves by thrusting their arms and hands through the canvas backdrop — classic horror movie imagery. The rented set remains for the duration of the act, spurring uncertainty as to whether the gashes are legitimate or just thoughtfully positioned Velcro. Other sets, such as the ones located in Elysium, are minimal, geometric and mobile, evoking the fluid and ephemeral nature of the afterlife. Walls of translucent glass and shiny reflective surfaces allow dancers to consort with their doppelgangers and blur the boundaries between artifice and reality.
Ballet and opera are, perhaps unfairly, considered the two classical theatre experiences that are the most likely to put the audience to sleep. They are also, entirely fairly, regarded as appealing to a very specific demographic. When the L.A. Opera unveiled Orpheus and Eurydice, it’s easy to dismiss the whole exhibition as another exercise for the elite. Regardless, the production is an undeniable tour de force, the two art forms serving to enhance rather than undermine the other, a testament to the power of interdisciplinary artistic collaboration.
Orpheus and Eurydice will conclude its run at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on March 25.

This Saturday, the California Science Center will unveil “King Tut: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh. The exhibit celebrates the 100-year anniversary of the discovery of King Tut’s tomb and is scheduled for a 10-city, seven-year international run. After its stint in Los Angeles, the exhibit will move on to tour Europe before being housed permanently at the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza, Egypt. 
Even though the famous golden mask that emblemizes King Tut is deemed too delicate to travel, other accoutrements from his coffin were on display. Kitty Guo | Daily Trojan
This is not the first time that an exhibition devoted to the Egyptian king has been curated. There have already been two major Tut displays within the past two decades: “Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs,” which spanned nine cities from 2004 to 2011, and “Tutankhamun: The Golden King and the Great Pharaohs,” which spanned eight cities from 2008 to 2013. 
However, the sheer size of “King Tut: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh,” as well as its element of novelty, sets this exhibit apart. More than 150 artifacts are on display, three times what has ever toured before. Furthermore, 66 of them have never before traveled out of Egypt.
The vast collection spans two floors at the Science Center and boasts nine different galleries. The priceless relics are accompanied by a multitude of technological enhancements, including 3-D visuals, digital content, 360-degree theatrical manifestations and custom audio soundscapes, to create a fully immersive experience. 
Highlights include the Guardian statue, a striking, life-sized statue that acted as a sentry standing before the entrance to the tomb; Tut’s one-of-a-kind golden shrine, its gilded gesso surface carved with intricate designs; and exquisitely crafted jewelry and bands that were found wrapped in between the linens of the mummy. 
The exhibit also pays tribute to Howard Carter, the archaeologist who discovered Tutankhamun’s tomb, with a detailed timeline of his life and career before, during and after his once-in-a-lifetime find. The Boy King instantaneously became entrenched in popular culture: “Tutmania” swept the world and, if this latest exhibit is any indication, that widespread fascination shows no signs of abating. The ancient Egyptians believed that an individual truly dies when the last person to speak their name dies. If that is the case, then King Tutankhamun has achieved immortality. 
“King Tut: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh” will be on view at the California Science Center through Jan. 6, 2019. Ticket prices range from $19.50 to $29.95.
CORRECTION: A previous version incorrectly stated the ticket prices and exhibit times. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

Ryan Song | Daily Trojan
My spring break trip to New York was a great opportunity to explore the city and get out of my comfort zone. In one particular incident, I had the opportunity to step out of said comfort zone through one of my favorite recreational activities: karaoke. Last Monday, my aunt recommended that we go to a place called Radio Star Karaoke, as it’s famous for its live performance setting  and public seating area with other people. Though I was hesitant at first, my aunt reassured me that most people were supportive and that most people were also bad singers, themselves.
When I entered the area, however, I realized that most people were in their late 30s or early 40s, singing songs from the ’60s through the early ’80s. Instantly, my imagined list of modern pop songs disintegrated, as I scrambled through my Spotify to find songs of past decades. When I stumbled upon Elton John’s “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting,” I immediately picked it without a second thought and unsurprisingly delivered a poor performance. The irony was that no one seemed to care about my inability to sing certain parts. However, this didn’t matter in my mind. Instead, it reaffirmed my notion that I care too much about what other people think of me.
On one hand, this could be understandable. The people you surround yourself with help shape you as a person and care about you. Naturally, you would likely apply some of their feedback to your life. This was not the case for that particular night because I was surrounded by random people who likely didn’t care about me at all.
There are a few components to this situation that all link back to my concerns with others’ perceptions of me. The first was my decision to pick an older song because I feared my audience wouldn’t like modern music. Indeed, I have this tendency to needlessly try to impress people, even if it comes at the cost of appearing to have a huge ego. This stems from the fact that I look at others and feel unimpressive in comparison, and I often respond by overcompensating for this insecurity.
Grace Cillo | Daily Trojan
But the truth is that it’s always better to be yourself. In this case, I should have just selected a modern song I truly loved, as opposed to one I only chose because it seemed more appropriate for the given setting. This mentality backfired, but instead of learning from the situation, I initially became concerned with how others in the room might think of me as a person. My performance of John’s song completely paralyzed me to the point that my aunt’s initial reassurance that no one would care didn’t comfort me. 
My takeaway from this was a newfound recognition of my unwillingness to take risks. I inevitably stay away from taking risks if I fear they won’t pay off. In fact, sometimes, this mentality goes so far as to cause me to needlessly think of all of the potential scenarios that could come out of a failed risk. 
Older music is so established and the people in the public karaoke area seemed well-versed in it, so I was afraid to challenge the established. Instead, I tried to adapt to it. It can sometimes be a good thing to adapt and not be narrow-minded, but in this case, I picked an older track simply to fit in rather than out of genuine interest.
Instead of being ashamed, I should be proud of my individual passions and interests because of their newness. That’s basically the whole reason I got into modern music: It’s new every day, and arguably hasn’t been discussed, analyzed or as widely enjoyed as older music. Obviously, I still have favorite artists and songs from bygone decades, but I feel the need to temporarily back off from the music of this age when people constantly talk about its greatness. Instead, I like being at the forefront of present-day discourse concerning today’s music. I want to see which songs or artists will hold up in the decades to come.
As the night went on, I eventually built up the courage to play more recent hits, such as Portugal The Man’s “Feel It Still” and Kanye West’s “Heartless,” and sure enough, my performing gradually became easier. Truly, I felt more comfortable singing those songs instead of attempting to try another song from John or other older artists.

This year’s edition of the USC Pro Day was star-studded, with the national spotlight shining bright on Cromwell Field as people from across the country tuned in to watch the Trojan NFL hopefuls showcase their abilities. At the center of attention, of course, was the prospective first overall pick, quarterback Sam Darnold, who did not disappoint in a spectacular throwing session in the pouring rain. Other potential NFL prospects like receiver Steven Mitchell and safety Chris Hawkins also put on impressive performances, looking to improve their draft stock. Every NFL team had representatives present, from area scouts to head coaches and general managers.

Guest List
Almost every team in the NFL sent a sturdy committee to Pro Day, headlined by the Cleveland Browns nearly bringing their entire front office to the event. Owner Jimmy Haslam, GM John Dorsey, offensive coordinator Todd Haley and head coach Hue Jackson were all present, probably to get a good look of their potential selection at the No. 1 slot in the draft in Darnold. GMs Steve Keim of the Arizona Cardinals and John Schneider of the Seattle Seahawks were in attendance, as well as Reggie McKenzie of the Raiders, Mike Maccagnan of the Jets and Marty Hurney of the Panthers. The list of head coaches that showed up was extensive as well, with Mike Vrabel of the Titans, Todd Bowles of the Jets, Pat Shurmur of the Giants, Steve Wilks of the Cardinals and Anthony Lynn of the Chargers all making an appearance. Plenty of notable alumni came by as well, with Adoree’ Jackson, Matt Leinart and Nelson Agholor all showing up to support the Trojan Family.
Pro Day Performances
Perhaps no one boosted their stock more at Pro Day than center Nico Falah. Falah, who probably was not present on most draft boards before today, had himself a day that may have forced scouts to take notice. He weighed in at 301 pounds before running a 5.13 second 40-yard dash and jumping a vert of 32 inches, both extremely impressive at that size. 
Safety Chris Hawkins also did well for himself, running a 4.60-second 40 and 6.88-second 3-cone shuttle. 
Receiver Steven Mitchell ran the fastest 40 of the day at 4.43 seconds, going on to catch passes for Darnold in his passing session. 
Outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu and defensive end Rasheem Green were both closely watched by scouts, and although they did not participate in much of the testing, they put on strong performances in the bag and cone drills. 
Highly regarded running back Ronald Jones elected not to test due to the hamstring injury he sustained at the NFL Combine, much to the dismay of many who have awaited a blazing 40 time from the speedster. He did, however, run routes for Sam Darnold in the throwing session, albeit at a noticeably slower speed than normal. 
Receiver Deontay Burnett opted not to participate, just as he had at the combine, for unknown reasons.
Sam and the Storm
The highlight of the day, the reason NFL Network sent their whole crew to Cromwell, of course, was Sam Darnold’s throwing session. The quarterback’s decision earlier this month not to throw at the combine put his passing performance at Pro Day squarely in the spotlight. 
The other standouts at quarterback in this year’s draft class like Josh Rosen, Lamar Jackson and Baker Mayfield all threw at the combine, and although many consider Darnold the No. 1 pick, a strong performance at his Pro Day would go a long way toward solidifying that status and moving him ahead of the pack. He did not disappoint. 
Early in the session, the rain came pouring down onto the field, yet Darnold continued his session unfazed. He threw nearly 60 balls, only about three of which were off target. Although quite a few of the throws were incomplete, this was largely due to drops by the receivers. He showed great anticipation and zip on his balls, showcasing a shortened delivery during his throws. 
The highlights of his performance came on a pair of back-to-back 50-60 yard deep balls perfectly placed to his receivers amid the downpour, going a long way to answer questions about his deep ball ability, especially compared to Josh Allen and Rosen, something that has been brought up by many critics. Darnold’s performance went about as well as it could have, and he seemed quite happy with it himself when speaking to NFL Network afterwards. 
“It’s special to be out here one last time at USC, throwing to my guys,” Darnold told the NFL Network. “It was just a great day in general.” 
For what it’s worth, Browns owner John Dorsey was seen talking to Darnold’s parents during his workout. We’ll see exactly how impressed he was by their son on April 26 when the Browns make the first selection in the 2018 NFL Draft.

After losing 8-7 to UC Irvine on Tuesday night, the 11-6 Trojans head up to Northern California for a three-game series against Stanford. The Cardinal is ranked third in the country and the second best team in the Pac-12 behind Oregon State — the number one team in the country. The Trojans have shown signs of being the caliber of team that could compete with a squad at Stanford’s level; the next step is for the team to play its best ball consistently.

Take the loss to UCI, for example. Just five days after the pitching staff combined to no-hit Utah, the Trojans allowed 8 runs to the Anteaters, 6 of which were earned. Irvine may have come up with timely hits, such as senior infielder Ryan Fitzpatrick’s 2-run homer in the bottom of the seventh inning, but many of the Anteaters’ runs came on Trojan mistakes.
UCI’s first run came when a runner was pushed in on a hit by pitch with the bases loaded, and an extra run scored later in the first inning on a fielding error by junior center fielder Lars Nootbaar. Finally, UCI scored the go-ahead run on a wild pitch third strike in the bottom of the eighth. These are the types of mishaps that lose winnable games, and they can’t continue if USC is to have a chance against Stanford.
Stanford’s strength is in its pitching staff. The Cardinal tops in the conference in batting average against, allowing teams to hit just .201 against them. Moreover, the Cardinal is second in the Pac-12 with a 2.33 earned run average. The most runs the team has given up in a game this season were 8 against Texas on March 8, one of just two losses this year for Stanford. This is a tough matchup for a Trojan lineup that has been inconsistent at best in 2018.
Their success is a group effort on the part of the whole pitching staff, but the standout is sophomore closer Jack Little. Having pitched 14 innings in seven games, Little has racked up six saves and 15 strikeouts, allowing just a .091 batting average against. The Trojans cannot afford to enter the later innings needing a rally because Little will shut them down.
The starters are more vulnerable, as evidenced by the lack of a single complete game performance. USC will need to score their runs early in order to have the best shot at winning the series.
Aside from pitching, Stanford isn’t very impressive in any other areas of the game. They rank in the bottom half of the Pac-12 in batting average (.250) and on base percentage (.346). Their slugging percentage (.386) is slightly better, but can’t be considered a strength. They don’t hit many home runs or extra base hits, and aren’t adept at drawing walks or stealing bases. This team really gets by on its pitching, so it’s a bad sign if the Trojans give up a lot of runs to Stanford.
USC’s biggest advantage in this series is in the field. The Trojans are one of the most capable defensive teams in the country, boasting a Division I-best .990 fielding percentage. Stanford, meanwhile, sits in the middle of the pack in the Pac-12 with a .973 fielding percentage. The Cardinal doesn’t commit too many errors, but one bobbled grounder or errant throw could make the difference in what is sure to be a low-scoring series.
There’s no way of knowing yet if Stanford is as good as their record indicates. This series marks the start of Pac-12 play for the Cardinal, and while they have played two Power-5 schools in Texas and Michigan, they have yet to play a team in the national top 25. They emerged from both of those series with convincing wins, but they did account for both of Stanford’s losses this season.
USC, on the other hand, has cut its teeth against some of the nation’s best competition. They managed a 3-2 victory over No. 17 UCLA on March 11, just a week after coming within two runs of a series victory over No. 4 Arkansas. If the track record is any indication, the Trojans won’t be afraid to take it to Stanford. They’re definite underdogs, but don’t be surprised if USC surprises the college baseball world this weekend.

The Trojan track and field team prepares for the Power 5 Trailblazer challenge this weekend following the conclusion of  their indoor season at the NCAA Indoor Championships at College Station, Tex., on March 10. The team impressed, securing a number of wins and even a world record against the nation’s best athletes. The men’s team finished second among all schools, with the women placing seventh.

With the indoor season coming to a close, the outdoor portion of the year got rolling the following week at the Trojan Invitational hosted by USC, where the Trojan athletes once again put on a show at their second outdoor meet of the season.
Both the men and women teams put on remarkable performances at the NCAA Indoor Championships, winning five events. Senior Kendall Ellis won the women’s 400m dash in spectacular fashion, with a collegiate and USC record time of 50.34. She topped the previous record by 12 milliseconds, set in 2014 by Phyllis Francis. The women’s 4x400m relay team also won first place, as freshman Kaeilin Roberts, sophomore Anna Cockrell, senior Deanna Hill and Ellis blazed a time of 3:27.45, the fourth fastest college time ever. 
The headline-grabbing performances of the weekend came from the men’s 4×400 relay team as they broke the world record in both events. Sophomore Michael Norman ran a ridiculous time of 44.52, breaking the previous record of 44.57 set by Kerron Clement back in 2005. He was a part of the Trojans’ other world record as well, as the men’s 4×400 team of Norman, freshman Zach Shinnick, junior Rai Benjamin and senior Ricky Morgan Jr. won the event with a time of 3:00.77. This is the only indoor 4x400m time below 3:01 ever recorded — an incredible feat. They had set the record themselves earlier in the year with a 3:01.98, only to have it broken by a 3:01.77 run by Poland earlier this month. Their remarkable performance at the NCAA championship gives them their record back, likely for much longer this time.
The beginning of the outdoor season continued the next week at the Trojan invitational, where USC dominated the field. The Trojans won a total of 12 events across the board, from throws to the relays. 
Freshman Joy McArthur won the women’s hammer throw with a best distance of 197-1 in her first college meet. Redshirt senior Nick Ponzio took first in the men’s shot put, with a best throw of 61-6.75. Redshirt senior Breanna Jemison won the women’s shot put on a best mark of 53-1.5. Senior Madisen Richards won the women’s long jump on her best jump of 19-11.75. USC also took a victory in the women’s high jump, as freshman Cassidy Palka took first on a best clearance of 5-7.00. Freshman Earnest Sears won the men’s high jump, clearing 7-2.50 for first place. 
The track portion of the meet went equally well for the Trojans, where they racked up six more wins, including the women’s 4×100 relay team of redshirt sophomore Angie Annelus, redshirt junior Ky Westbrook, Hill and freshman TeeTee Terry, who burnt up the track with a time of 43.49, securing a victory. Freshman Chanel Brissett won the women’s 100m hurdles, running a wind-aided 13.10. 
Coming off their hot streak, the Trojans will head into the body of the outdoor track and field season in the coming weeks. They will compete in the Power 5 Trailblazer Challenge this upcoming weekend, where they will look to continue their success.

When it rains, it pours: That should have been the slogan for the Pac-12 in the last year. 
It was bad enough for the “conference of champions” to be excluded from the College Football Playoff, for its teams to go a combined 1-8 in postseason play and for its champion, USC, to be thumped by Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl.
That was not the most humiliating thing the Pac-12 went through in the last six months. Not even close. In men’s basketball, it sent three teams to the NCAA Tournament. Two of them lost in the play-in round: ASU fell to Syracuse and UCLA couldn’t beat St. Bonaventure (who?). And Arizona better be thankful that top seed Virginia lost to 16-seed UBMC, because otherwise its humiliation at the hands of Buffalo would’ve been the defining upset of the tournament. The Pac-12 became the first Power Six conference in history to fail to send a team to the second round of March Madness.
How about USC, which began the season ranked 10th in the country? It finished the year unranked, was snubbed from the tournament and saw its season end with a loss in the second round of the NIT to Western Kentucky. Oh, and it remains also still embroiled in an FBI investigation that resulted in its best player, De’Anthony Melton, leaving school early and its associate coach, Tony Bland, being arrested. 
That’s still not the worst of it. Arizona, the Pac-12’s only real brand name nationally for men’s basketball, has literally zero recruits for next season because it, too, is caught in the FBI pay-for-play sting. The Wildcats also had an assistant coach arrested and their head coach, Sean Miller, was reportedly wiretapped discussing a $100,000 payment. Arizona is not going to be good again for a long, long time.
And we haven’t even gotten into how three UCLA men’s basketball players were arrested for shoplifting in China. When this is the fifth worst thing that has happened to your conference in the span of a few months, you know you’ve had a bad year.
So where do we go from here? How does a conference that has become nothing short of a national embarrassment redeem itself? It depends on whether we’re talking about the short or long-term problems.
By short term, we’re talking the results we see on the field or the court. In football, the Pac-12 is better than the 1-8 postseason showing — there were circumstances and match-ups that created the perfect storm. Don’t forget that last season, Washington played Alabama in the semifinals of the College Football Playoff and USC toppled Penn State in the Rose Bowl. And in basketball last season, three teams made it into the Sweet 16 and Oregon advanced to the Final Four. 
It’s possible that the results we saw this season were anomalies, just one bad break after another. It happens. But it’s the Pac-12’s job to put its schools in position to never have these instances happen again, and that’s where Commissioner Larry Scott and the Pac-12’s long-term problems come in.
Let’s start with the Pac-12 Network, which has been an unmitigated disaster for the conference. While SEC and Big Ten programs are raking in around $8 million in revenue from their TV contracts, Pac-12 schools received just $2.5 million in 2017. That might still seem like a lot of money, but when you’re trying to keep up with the likes of Alabama or Michigan, it’s a paltry sum. Add in the fact that the Pac-12 still can’t reach an agreement with DirecTV and you have a network that’s making little profit and not giving its programs the requisite exposure — the worst of both worlds.
Speaking of exposure, the start times are not conducive at all. Nobody is staying up for a 10:45 p.m. kickoff time on the East Coast to watch Washington State play football on ESPN2. They’re just not.
And then there’s the scheduling. USC last season was a prime example. Keep in mind that the Trojans were probably the Pac-12’s best shot at producing a playoff team, and then, listen to this: USC was forced to play 12 straight weeks without a bye, and by the end of the season, it was pummeled by injuries. It had to play Washington State in Pullman, Wash., on a Friday night after playing a road game the week before. And it had to play Notre Dame on the road, a week after facing a tough Utah team at home. 
These are not excuses for USC’s two regular season losses. Rather, it’s the fact that the conference did not put the Trojans in a position to succeed by handing them a terrible schedule that ultimately left them outside the playoff picture. Why does Alabama, which won the national championship, get to play Mercer in the middle of the season and essentially take that week off for rest? Because the SEC actually puts its best teams in a position to succeed.
Perhaps Scott is doing enough to satisfy the presidents, chancellors and athletic directors of the universities he works with — he does make $4.2 million a year, the highest of any conference CEO. But from the outside looking in, it’s pretty unanimous that the Pac-12 is in need of repair, that steps need to be taken to ensure the dumpster fire that was the 2017-2018 season will never happen again.

Rights exist primarily for one simple reason: to prevent wrongs. However, rights are not absolute — they must exist in a hierarchy because in many instances, rights collide with and contradict one another. The case of racist verbal expressions that provoke violence is one such example. Yes, these instigators have the right to free speech, but that right should be outweighed by the danger of infringing on others’ right to safety. 
The same concept can be applied to the issue of bullying in school settings. The provoker has the constitutional right to speak freely, but it is in the greater interest of the school to discipline the provoker and restrict his speech to maintain the safety for the victim and the surrounding community. Private schools have larger leeway: Just last year, USC intervened when a street vendor sold shirts displaying a swastika within school premises because they did not comply with the University’s guidelines for vendors. A similar intervention would take place if a group of students gathered in a KKK or neo-Nazi club. 
And yet, there is an argument to be made that a public school cannot expel a student merely for “highly offensive and deeply hurtful statements.” After all, this right to free speech is the crux of the First Amendment. 
Differing from the standards of private institutions, public schools — which accept taxpayer money  — must comply with the First Amendment, which guarantees free speech in public institutions. Public universities seem to be held to a different standard than other federal institutions, though. While neo-Nazi groups and the KKK are allowed to assemble and meet around the country with limited governmental intervention, students have been expelled from public universities for making racial slurs. One of the most notable examples is a University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa student’s expulsion for posting a video of her using repeated racial slurs to a private Instagram account in January. 
Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
The courts have ruled that free speech is “less free” in school settings, and that students shed some of their constitutional rights when they arrive at school gates. These rulings apply directly to grade and high schools, but federal courts have occasionally applied the same concept to college campuses in cases where speech causes a disruption to the educational process. 
But it is difficult to make the argument that the mere recital of racial slurs on a private video automatically disrupts the educational process or instigates violence. There have been no reports of violence on the University of Alabama’s campus regarding this incident. The University of Alabama’s president, Stuart R. Bell, released a statement describing the student’s videos as “highly offensive and deeply hurtful.” He also said “the actions of this student do not represent the larger student body or the values of our University.” Bell is absolutely in the right in releasing this statement, and he has an obligation to address student conduct and clarify that the University does not condone the use of such slurs. The First Amendment may provide freedom of speech and expression but does not sweepingly guarantee a right to do so without reproach.
This is not at all to say that the student’s conduct should go unpunished socially. If such conduct comes to the attention of a school, the university should still release a statement calling out the student, explaining that her statements do not reflect those of the school. Professors should be allowed to refuse to write letters of recommendations for her, and students should be allowed to express their vehement disagreement with her words. 
Of course, statements that outwardly advocate for violence against a particular group of people can almost certainly be concluded to instigate violence or cause a disturbance. But it is also clear that speech that merely offends a particular group cannot be restricted by the government or public institutions. 
As such, personal and identity-based attacks — while they are ineffective policy points and utterly inefficient conversation drivers — are not always punishable by laws. They are, like all other kinds of conduct, always punishable in the court of public opinion. And the sentence in that courtroom may be just as — if not more — agonizing than one handed down by an old man in a robe.

The messages are chilling: “Buy blacks in bulk,” one comment said. “You only need to go as far as Mauritiana to get slaves,” said another. “Much cheaper.” And another: “Bomb the mosques.”
They read like comments sent between white supremacists from a dark corner of the internet. But they’re not. They’re messages sent in a WhatsApp group chat between a group of law students at the University of Exeter, which suspended a number of them Tuesday.
It’s a dilemma that has reached across the pond. As neo-Nazism and white nationalism have entered the mainstream, universities everywhere are grappling with what to do when their students are openly racist. Just over two years ago, Oklahoma University became infamous for expelling two fraternity brothers for singing a racist chant. And while the University of Exeter chose to suspend its students, in the United States, public universities face constitutional obstacles to punish students for hate speech. Nevertheless, it’s crucial that universities use these incidents as moments to teach, reflect, restate and recommit to their own values.
There is something deeply satisfying about universities that have chosen to expel students who are racist and hateful and whose rhetoric has had the potential to cause real harm to their peers. It is an institution saying that it will not tolerate white supremacy on its campus — which is critical for students to hear in an age in which neo-Nazism masquerades as legitimate scholarship. That decision tells students that their university is there to support them, to generate a positive and productive learning environment, and it is aware of the social context that it operates in.
But public universities that have expelled students for expressing racist views face real legal consequences. After a University of Alabama student was expelled for posting Instagram videos rife with racial slurs and epithets in January, UC Berkeley Law School dean and constitutional scholar Erwin Chemerinsky told Inside Higher Ed that she would have a “strong case” for suing the university on First Amendment grounds. And the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit determined that the punishment given to a fraternity at George Mason University for holding a culturally insensitive “ugly women contest” violated freedom of expression under the First Amendment.
Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
“But if the First Amendment allows the state to punish someone for ugly remarks that are profoundly offensive, as in this case, then it acquires the power to do the same for other speech that is offensive to those in power,” the court wrote.
So even when dealing with the most blatant, vile hate speech targeted toward students, it seems like public universities are hamstrung in condemning those students. Private schools, of course, are free to suspend or expel students for any reason — and, for racism and discrimination, they should exercise that power.
Regardless, these incidents still provide important learning opportunities. While universities have an obligation to foster open discourse, they also have the right and privilege to assert their values as institutions. When a university is struck with an incident of racism — like that experienced by former Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath in 2015, which engendered a year of student engagement with diversity policy — it must react quickly, decisively and forcefully. It must show students that it is committed to creating an inclusive environment for students through initiatives that matter much more than some racist student’s wayward comment — through inclusive hiring policies for faculty and staff, commitments to affirmative action policies to lower barriers for students of color, financial support for cultural centers and resource centers for marginalized students, diverse coursework that challenges mainstream narratives, specific and focused initiatives to improve inclusion on campus, access to administrators for students with concerns regarding diversity and inclusion and a demonstration of risks taken in order to emphasize equity. 
So public universities can’t kick out their racist students. Fine. But they can engage in activity that is much more meaningful in the long term: They can better their institutions. In becoming more inclusive, they can beget graduates who are thoughtful, compassionate and have the intellectual tools to combat the fever of white supremacy revealing itself on every platform. And maybe that’s more effective than removing racist students, anyway; maybe that’s the way that we see ourselves out of the ideological resurgence of hatred and bigotry.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted unanimously  Tuesday in favor of creating a task force to address issues of inclusivity on campus including the recent petition to rename the Von KleinSmid Center. The center is named after former USC President Rufus Von KleinSmid, who was a eugenicist. Three bylaw amendments were also introduced in the meeting, which the Senate will vote on next Tuesday.
Senator Preston Fregia (center right) proposed the resolution to create a committee to change the name of the Von KleinSmid Center and evaluate inclusivity and diversity on campus. Yuwei Xi | Daily Trojan
Speaker Pro Tempore Tyler Matheson emphasized that the resolution does more than merely examine the VKC name as an isolated case. He said it involves a larger discussion regarding the University’s values, which will be moderated by a task force.
“It’s not just removing the name,” Matheson said. “It has a larger impact on what we value as a community on campus, what we see to be the standard of what is OK and what is not OK.
It’s about creating a task force to help solve these problems. I wanted to make it clear that this resolution is much bigger than the VKC name change.”
Senator Preston Fregia, who spearheaded the movement to change the name of VKC with the petition and introduced the resolution, spoke about how harmful the name of VKC is to the atmosphere of diversity and inclusivity at USC.
“I think that what it does is it takes a part of our history and says some of us might not be as important as our traditions,” Fregia said. “[Von KleinSmid’s] views are still something that some cherish here.”
After the passage of the VKC name change resolution, Senator Katie Bolton and Co-Director of Service Student Assembly Alec Vandenberg presented a modified version of an amendment that was rejected by the senate five weeks ago. 
If passed, the amendment would add a new external affairs director position to the advocacy branch of USG in order to promote political awareness and involvement among undergraduate students. The initial version of the amendment was rejected by the senate primarily due to concerns that the position could politicize the non-partisan USG. Bolton and Vandenberg trimmed the stated role of the new director by removing its involvement in programming events in order to address these concerns.
Two more bylaw amendments were each proposed jointly by Director of External Affairs Mai Mizuno and Steve Helmeci, a senior adviser to USG President Austin Dunn. The first of the two amendments aimed to make proposing referendums more accessible.
Helmeci explained that the purpose of this amendment is to allow for more referendums to appear on student ballots while maintaining reasonably high standards for the passage of referendums. The amendment would specifically lower the minimum number of required signatures from one-tenth of the undergraduate population to 1,000 for a referendum to appear on the ballot while maintaining a requirement that 25 percent of students vote affirmatively for its passage.
The final proposed bylaw amendment was brought forth in the spirit of safeguarding student autonomy over student organizations, particularly in light of the University’s decision to fire the Norman Topping Fund director. The amendment aims to achieve this goal by recognizing broader authority of the Chief Diversity Officer and requiring more administrative accountability in the form of requesting reports from student organizations to the USG Senate. 
The vote on the bylaw amendments will take place next Tuesday.

USC strategic public relations graduate student Anais Medina Diaz was upset when she found out last week that she could only invite four people to her satellite graduation ceremony. Her friends at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism felt the same.
Last year, the graduation ceremonies for the School of Communication and the School of Journalism were held in separate locations. Daily Trojan file photo.
“We all felt this sudden change was inconsiderate and insensitive to our cultures and families and friends,” Diaz said. 
Diaz decided to take action. During spring break, she created a petition  addressed to Annenberg Dean Willow Bay and Annenberg’s Office of Communication and Marketing, urging the school to reconsider the invite limit.
Before spring break, Annenberg announced that the ceremonies for the School for Journalism and the School for Communication would be combined, as opposed to other years when the two held separate ceremonies. It had also announced that Annenberg students will only be able to invite four guests. 
“Most of us, I know in my cohort, have extended families and mentors that would love to see us graduate,” graduate student Brittany Stamoulis said. “Especially with our master degrees, it was very important for the most of us and a lot of us are first generation college students so that’s a big thing.” 
The petition asks Bay and the Office of Communications and Marketing to either hold separate ceremonies, increase the ticket amount per student, open the reception to more guests, or have the ceremony take place at an open space on campus to avoid the ticket limit. 
“Family members and friends have booked flights and hotel rooms to see this one special moment in their family’s history. Expenses that can not be refunded, cancelled or rearranged. Days off work that can not be repaid,” the petition read.
The petition said Annenberg failed to communicate the information properly and that the “process to making this decision should’ve been more open and transparent.”
“We are planning what we know will be an exceptional and memorable experience for our graduates as well as their families and friends,” Emily Cavalcanti, associate dean for communications and marketing, said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We are finalizing the details of our satellite ceremony and are days away from sharing an update with our Annenberg community.”
The petition had 140 signatures at the time of publication. Diaz hopes that friends and family will be able to participate in the ceremony alongside to the graduating students.
“We understand why the school would want to combine and ticket the ceremony but feel this decision and announcement should’ve been made with more lead time,” Diaz said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Additionally, the limited ticket number should be more inclusive of the culturally diverse students within the school who depend on the support and help from family members, friends and mentors.”

Former graduate student David Jonathan Brown was ordered Tuesday to be committed to a California Department of State Hospitals location for up to life. 
Brown was charged with the stabbing death of professor Bosco Tjan, and was ruled not guilty by reason of insanity in January based on two psychiatric evaluation reports. 
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Leslie Swain recommended Brown be committed to Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino. 
Steve Schoenfield, Brown’s public defender, said he is pleased Brown will receive medical treatment. 
“He’s severely mentally ill and needs help,” Schoenfield said. “Hopefully with that help he will get well and with each day, improve. I hope to see him one day being assimilated back into society. I don’t believe that’s going to be in the near future, of course.”
Brown was arrested in December 2016 after Tjan was found dead from multiple stab wounds.
Tjan was a professor of psychology and co-director of the Cognitive Neuroimaging Center at Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. He had worked at the University since 2001.
Prior to the fatal stabbing incident, Brown had studied neuroscience and had been working in Tjan’s lab. Police said that the murder was motivated by a “personal dispute.”
“I think that this is a tragedy all the way around, and I know how much [Tjan] liked David and David liked him,” Schoenfield said. “He supported David and he was a great mentor to him, and I hope his family can have peace.”

Since its creation in January 2017, Trojan Advocates for Political Progress has more than doubled in size. The now 60-member organization has expanded as it has strived to raise political and social awareness and increase engagement in the USC community.
Photo from FacebookEncouraging activism · Trojan Advocates for Political Progress encourages members to guide activism and pursue interests by allowing them to vote on the topics discussed at the weekly meetings and to pitch their own ideas for events and speakers they are interested in.
“[We want to make] people more knowledgeable and passionate about different causes so they can take their advocacy to the next level [and] have [that] knowledge, have those tools, have those experiences, so wherever they go off after college they can still put all of that to use,” said Alec Vandenberg, TAPP’s president and a columnist for the Daily Trojan.
The organization aims to guide activism rather than dictate it by supporting members who want to pursue particular interests.
“We want to be that conduit,” Vandenberg said. “We try to provide them outlets to make their voices heard, so we try to find a balance between what we see in the news and what we’re hearing from advocates.”
The organization has provided opportunities for student activism by hosting events and fundraisers like March for SC, a series of events showing support for gun safety, and Roses for Refugees, which raised money for Syrian refugees. The organization also invites guest speakers ranging from union representatives to field directors for political campaigns.
“I’m not a poli sci or public policy major at all, so I didn’t know how that stuff worked,” said executive board member Kate Cunningham, an engineering major, said. “Most of our speakers tend to be from political campaigns, so having their first-person perspective on what that’s like for them has been really cool.”
This semester, the organization created eight committees to focus on different aspects of political engagement including elections, inclusivity and the legislative process.
The initiative-focused committees are responsible for hosting at least one event during the semester, ranging from social to community service events, to raise awareness about different issues. Currently, the inclusivity committee is focusing on creating a project based off of gender representation in politics. However, many of the events put together by TAPP are spontaneous.
“Our events kind of pop up weekly,” Vandenberg said. “There’s not necessarily things we have planned months in advance. It kind of just depends on what’s happening right now. [We try] to be a little flexible while still trying to maintain some stability.”
Much of the club’s activism takes place on Trousdale Parkway, which executive board members consider an effective place to bring awareness to a large number of students.
“Whether that’s telling people to call Congress or fundraisers, we think that’s the most effective way to engage the most people especially because social media only reaches so many people in different circles,” Vandenberg said.
In the next few months, the organization plans to host more committee events, along with a political round table discussion with other campus political clubs, and attending the Earth Day march in April.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article attributed a quote incorrectly to Jessica O’Connor. It has since been attributed to Kate Cunningham. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

In its eighth year as an eclectic electronic dance paradise, Beyond Wonderland brings throngs of young, scantily clad, vibrant ravers to San Bernardino in a two-day festival experience with a diverse lineup of DJs, featuring household name artists Alesso and Tiësto.

Despite the looming rain and chilly breeze, more than 70,000 EDM fans eagerly flocked to the NOS Events Center, an outdoor fairground decorated in an Alice in Wonderland-like fashion, which boasted curious decorations like climbable teacups, a larger-than-life cards display, a glowing clock and flaming lily cups at the center of the venue’s lagoon.
Loud, heart-thumping beats constantly emanated from the venue’s five stages, enticing attendees to dance even out of sight of a performance. Yet, the magic of the rave experience is created through a ubiquitous energy at the heart of a raving crowd and its PLUR mindset, a rave concept that embodies peace, love, unity and respect to create camaraderie among all festival-goers. 
Friendly signs on totem poles like “Lost? Come dance with us!” and strangers’ openness to sharing gum, water, kandi bracelets and even kaleidoscope goggles revealed the compassionate side of festival culture often overshadowed by drug abuse and overdoses. 
Day One 
Dark clouds and an ominous breeze hinted at a chance of rain on Friday night, yet attendees remained undeterred. From bare shimmering bodysuits to lit-up fur coats, festival fashion was not sacrificed for a few drops of rain. 
Beyond’s multiple themed stages allow for a diverse showcase of DJs spanning across genres and maturity in the industry. The Wide Awake Art Car, a whimsical outdoors set-up next to the lagoon, highlighted up-and-coming artists like female DJ Wenzday, LondonBridge and I_O. 
Queen’s Domain was undoubtedly one of the most popular stages of the night with its lineup of notable DJs Seven Lions, Elephante and Dash Berlin. In the early evening, however, French DJ Mercer delivered repetitive beats and minimal engagement with the crowd, causing audience enthusiasm to dip before k?d (pronounced kid) performed his showstopping set with breathtaking, anime-inspired visuals that pulsed to the beat of his songs.

The most memorable sets of the night, like k?d and Seven Lions’, combined a layer of visual stimulation to the DJ’s auditory creation through the use of laser beams, flashing rhythmic lights and flickering full-screen graphics. 
Later in the night, Dash Berlin integrated an array of pop tunes in his set, remixing songs like Clean Bandit’s “Symphony” and Skylar Grey’s “Coming Home.” Dash produces work that falls into the trance genre of EDM, which utilizes melodic techno beats and soft female vocals, creating an ethereal experience for audiences seeking a slower tempo to which to dance. 
Other EDM genres like trap, hardstyle and dubstep elicited faster, psychedelic beats to the delight of many. Kayzo, one of the last DJs of the night, delivered hard-hitting beats that defy genre, as he fused together different elements of trap and hardstyle into his songs. During his set, attendees packed themselves into the Mad Hatter’s Castle stage to escape the midnight downpour. Kayzo’s rapid, unpredictable sounds elicited a viral energy in the crowd, as people headbanged to the bass or moshed — jumped — violently into one another to the beat of the music. Kayzo’s set suffered minor technical difficulties due to the sudden rain, which continued into early Saturday morning. 
Day Two 
The second night in Wonderland was colder, although there was no chance of rain. The heated energy inside the tents quickly warmed up any attendee drawn into the crowd. Queen’s Domain and Mad Hatter’s Castle once again were popular stages, featuring trap and electro DJs like Flosstradamus, Alesso and DJ Mustard. 
DJs Kuuro and Yultron lit up Queen’s Domain with their vivid sets earlier in the evening, with Kuuro delivering a darker, goth cyberpunk vibe through his flickering graphics and Yultron encapsulating the crowd’s enthusiasm through bright neons and psychedelic visuals. 
Yultron, a Chinese American artist from Los Angeles, portrayed cultural symbols in his sets, from swirling sushi and dancing cartoon Asian men to a full-screen graphic of maneki-neko, a popular Japanese cat figurine that symbolizes good luck. His music, however, consisted of modern remixes of different sounds. He remixed NBC’s The Office theme song, Kendrick Lamar’s “Humble,” RL Grime’s “Core” and DJ Porter Robinson’s “Shelter” — songs varying across genres and moods that showcase Yultron’s distinctive sound and talent. Throughout various sets, the crowd chorused “woo woo’s” to the beat, and DJs utilized familiar rapid beats, similar to a horse galloping, in the background of their musical transitions.

Other DJs like Mr. Carmack, an artist known for mixing hip-hop and dance music, utilized 2017’s top hits to pump up the crowd, such as Kendrick Lamar’s “Loyalty” and Cardi B’s “Bodak Yellow.” R3HAB delivered similar club-like beats fused with well-known vocalists such as Rihanna and Ed Sheeran (Sheeran’s “Shape of You” was remixed with a trappy beat). 
Yet, Alesso and Flosstradamus were the highlights of the night, with Floss delivering hard, traphouse beats compared to Alesso’s house and pop blend. Alesso’s surreal graphics and musical pauses created a surreal mood during his set, allowing the audience to cease its dancing and take in the music before continuing. His transitions effortlessly bring the crowd from one song to another, with his best performances featuring popular songs the crowd can sing along to, such as Coldplay and The Chainsmoker’s “Something Just Like This” and Alesso and One Republic’s collaboration “If I Lose Myself.”

Kitty Guo | Daily Trojan
I am from Orange County, Calif., where, true to its name, oranges are never in short supply. My parents are regular fixtures at Saturday morning farmers markets, from which they always return hauling a red netted bag stretched taut with oranges haphazardly bundled together. In the winter they are Navels, which shed their peels and divide into segments effortlessly, the perfect afternoon snack. In the summer, Valencias, sweet and tart and dripping with juice, guaranteed to leave your mouth and fingers sticky.
Living in Southern California, one of the two major orange suppliers in the United States (the other being, duh, Florida), they are a fruit that I’ve always taken for granted. Until I picked up John McPhee’s Oranges.
Oranges weaves a rich tapestry that encompasses every aspect of the humble citrus fruit. McPhee delves into the different varieties of oranges, sure, but also the people whose livelihoods are bound up in their production: orange growers, orange pickers, orange packers, orange botanists, orange barons. He chronicles the history of oranges, of how they were introduced to the Western Hemisphere by Christopher Columbus himself; he lists common pests that feed on orange groves, including, but not limited to, white flies, white-fly fungi, aphids, plant bugs, orange-dog caterpillars, Mediterranean fruit flies, yellow scales, black scales, purple scales, Florida wax scales, Florida red scales, snow scales, dictyospermum scales, chaff scales, melanose and citrus scab; he clarifies what orange juice “from concentrate” really means. I’ve never bought into supermarket OJ, preferring my juice freshly squeezed, and McPhee’s description of how concentrate plants vacuum-evaporate oranges within an inch of their life, before dumping in loads of chemical flavorings like d-limonene, only reinforced my inclinations. 
Photo courtesy of Daunt Books
Meticulously researched and methodically recounted, Oranges is a celebration of the banal, a deep probe into the mundanities of everyday life. “Sonder” is the realization that “each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own.” Yet to be coined is a word to describe the epiphany that not only do the people surrounding us possess infinite stories, but so do the objects: the shampoo bottle, the tape dispenser, the empty Fritos bag crumpled on the side of the freeway. It is a revelation I am still reeling from. Everything harbors a latent origin story as elaborate and involved as yours or mine, but lacks the means to relay them; to uncover them, we must rely on journalists like McPhee.
The brilliant mind behind Oranges, John McPhee, is one of my favorite authors and generally my all-around idol. A pioneer of the creative nonfiction genre, McPhee has contributed more than 100 pieces to The New Yorker and teaches journalism at Princeton. Recently, New York Magazine ran a profile on him in which he describes himself as “shy to the point of dread,” yet the writer gets the sense that his friends and family “had all been waiting, respectfully, for decades for the chance to gush about him in public.” 
As someone whose most ardent desire is to become a staff writer at The New Yorker, to see my name in Irvin typeface accompanied by an adorable vector portrait, McPhee is everything I aspire to be both personally and professionally. 
McPhee has written other stellar books, about his backpacking trips into the Alaskan wilderness and voyages in a merchant ship down the coast of South America, but Oranges remains my favorite, because it focuses on the micro rather than the macro. It is trumpeted as the epitome of factual, thorough reporting that still remains stylish, witty and engaging. 
Half a century after its publication in 1967, it remains in a league of its own. To compare Oranges to any other lesser work would be like comparing apples to, well, oranges.

Fresh off the heels of the insanely popular Yayoi Kusama exhibit Infinity Mirrors, The Broad recently presented its new special exhibition Jasper Johns: Something Resembling Truth on Feb. 10. 
At 87, Jasper Johns is one of contemporary art’s most iconic and influential living artists. The exhibit showcases different periods of his prolific career, which spans an impressive six decades. 
The exhibit begins with a room replete with recurring flag and target motifs. His most recognizable work, “Three Flags,” which stacks three star-spangled banners on top of each other, hangs here. Subsequent galleries chronicle Johns’ exploration of various media and methods, neatly partitioning his different periods of experimentation. “Corpse and Mirror” and “Between the Clock and the Bed” detail forceful cross hatching in bold primary colors; “Figure 7” and “0 Through 9” document his fascination with numbers; “Painted Bronze” and “Savarin” are meta depictions of his own paintbrushes and palette knives; “Bridge” and “Catenary (I Call to the Grave)” display lengths of string stretched across muted canvases. 
Seeking to break from the staid seriousness of abstract expressionists, Johns tends toward playfulness, often poking fun at the movement, its renowned artists and even himself. Yet even as he critiques the conventions of abstract expressionism, his parody nevertheless necessitates engagement in its forms and styles. His forays into pop art retain an air of solemn gravity, augmented by his own eminence. Viewing Something Resembling Truth, one gets the sense of swallowing a spoonful of medicine; it’s not fun, but ultimately, it’s good for you.

To be fair, any installation succeeding Infinity Mirrors would have a hard time filling Kusama’s enormous shoes. Something Resembling Truth does its best to keep up, but the massive media maelstrom that Kusama’s art generated ensured that anything even a hint more sedate and traditional would seem like a bit of a letdown. It doesn’t help that Johns’ art doesn’t lend itself well to breeding online hype; his formless shapes and liberal use of grays and beiges aren’t quite as flashy and Instagram-friendly as thousands of twinkling lights.
In terms of accessibility, Kusama is a county fair and Johns is a country club. Something Resembling Truth will delight art critics and historians who are familiar with his significance and influence on the development of modern art. But it will delight no one else. 
In a way, the Johns and Kusama exhibitions represent the two opposite persuasions that inform the museum-going experience. Should museums and other cultural institutions cater to the general audience, which treats them as selfie breeding grounds but supply much-needed publicity, or should they provide an elevated encounter for “in the know” art world elites, who may be snobs but also be more appreciative? It is up to each individual to decide which experience they prefer. 
Jasper Johns: Something Resembling Truth will continue at The Broad through May 13.

While most of the USC student population was on spring break, the USC women’s water polo team was hard at work rebounding from a tough finish to the Barbara Kalbus Invitational in which they fell to No. 1 Stanford 9-3 in the championship match.

Staring down three top 10 matches over 10 days, the Trojans had a rather daunting task ahead of them with back-to-back home matches against No. 7 UC Irvine and No. 5 Hawai’i before traveling once again to take on Hawai’i in Honolulu.
In their home opener at Uytengsu Aquatics Center, the Trojans proved dominant against the Anteaters by a 13-7 margin and later defeated the Rainbow Wahine 12-7. Thanks to 6 total goals over the course of the home stand from superstar freshman Paige Hauschild, a strong combined effort from keepers junior Amanda Longan and senior Victória Chamorro and an incredible 4-goal first half performance from sophomore utility Maud Megens, the third-ranked Trojans headed into spring break looking like an incredibly formidable squad from top to bottom.
In Honolulu, USC managed to dominate play against the nation’s fifth-ranked squad. The spring break destination provided no break for the Trojans as they went to work defeating Hawai’i 9-5. Hauschild, again, put up a hat trick for the Women of Troy while senior captain Brianna Daboub notched 2 goals of her own.
Now, the Trojans prepare to face off against No. 17 Princeton as the two squads will hop in the Uytengsu pool on Thursday night. At this point, USC has more than recovered from its late February loss to the Cardinal and have begun to string together an impressive streak of wins. Using this momentum, the Women of Troy will prepare to take on a team that they dominated a year ago under similar conditions.
Playing in Los Angeles, the top-ranked USC ladies dominated Princeton, leading by as many as 8 goals in the second period en route to a 12-3 final score. Megens, the star of the UC Irvine game, was on top of her game in last year’s matchup as she netted 5 goals on the day, including 3 in the first period alone.
While the past year has brought plenty of change to both programs, many of the faces remain the same on both sides. Megens, Daboub, Longan and Chamorro all provided valuable performances in taking down the Tigers. On the other side, Princeton’s Haley Wan, who alone scored all 3 of the Tiger goals against USC in 2017, will be coming back to face the Trojans as a senior with 37 goals under her belt in 2018.
As is the case with most games, USC will look to play its offense through Hauschild. Coming off her fourth MPSF Newcomer of the Week award Hauschild is on as hot a streak as any player in the nation. Averaging 2.57 goals per game, Hauschild leads the MPSF in that metric and has notched multi-goal games in 11 of 14 games this year.
“For Paige, the sky is the limit,” USC head coach Jovan Vavic said of Hauschild earlier in the season. “I’m just excited to see how high she can go.”
Thursday’s Princeton game will be the team’s first televised match of the season. Kicking off at 5 p.m., the game will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.

Coming into Tuesday’s road game at UC Irvine, the glass half-empty takeaway from the USC baseball team’s last few games was that the lineup was struggling. USC ranks near the bottom of the strong Pac-12 in nearly every hitting statistic, from batting average to runs to RBIs. 
Alex Zhang | Daily Trojan
Strong pitching and fielding performances carried the Trojans to a series win against Utah the previous weekend, but the Trojans needed their hitters to step it up. They did so against Irvine; it just wasn’t enough, as USC lost 8-9 to drop to 11-6 on the season. 
The Anteaters jumped on the Trojans early. Senior starting pitcher Mason Perryman never got control of the strike zone, hitting the first four batters he faced, gift-wrapping UC Irvine a run. Irvine catcher Jacob Castro followed up with a single to center, which turned into 3 runs on a fielding error by the Trojans’ junior center fielder Lars Nootbaar. By the time freshman reliever John Beller got USC’s third out of the frame, Irvine held a 4-0 advantage.
The Trojans would respond with a run in each of the next two innings. In the top of the second, redshirt junior designated hitter Stephen Dubb scored on a single to center from redshirt sophomore catcher Kaleb Murphy. A two-out strikeout from sophomore right fielder Matthew Acosta, however, left redshirt junior third baseman Angelo Armenta stranded on third.
In the top of the third, junior first baseman Dillon Paulson hit a solo home run down the right field line to cut the deficit to 2 runs. Another strikeout, this time swinging by Dubb, left another runner in scoring position.
The Trojans had their chances to tie the game early, but didn’t take full advantage. The Anteaters did. In the bottom of the third, Irvine second baseman Cole Kreuter singled to left field, bringing Castro in to score. Both pitching staffs tightened up, and the margin stayed at 5-2 for the next three innings.
At the top of the seventh, the Trojans rallied. Nootbaar singled, then scored on a double to left center from junior second baseman Brandon Perez. After advancing to third on a ground out, Perez scored on a double down the right field line by sophomore left fielder Blake Sabol, who would score two batters later when Armenta doubled to center. The game was tied at 5.
USC didn’t maintain momentum for long. In the bottom of the inning, Irvine first baseman Ryan Fitzpatrick bombed a 2-run homer off of junior reliever Solomon Bates, a no-doubter over the left field wall. Nootbaar, who broke out of his struggles in this game, tied it up with a 2-run shot of his own in the top of the eighth. 
The Trojans had worked their way back into the game, but a bad mistake ruined it all. Two singles off of sophomore reliever Austin Manning and an error loaded the bases in the bottom of the eighth, handing freshman Brian Gursky quite a mess when he came on in relief. 
Gursky did well, striking out the first two batters, but the second at-bat ended with a wild pitch, scoring the go-ahead run for Irvine. Despite the fact that Gursky retired each batter he faced, one unfortunate misstep made the difference in this back-and-forth game, as USC failed to score in the ninth.
The Trojans will start a three-game series at Stanford on Friday. If the unforced mistakes continue, the third-ranked team in the country will show them just how important every play is in baseball.

The USC football team returned from spring break Tuesday, resuming camp with its fourth practice. The lead-up to the April 14 spring game continues as the team looks to fill vacancies left by departing players.

Injury Updates
Sophomore tailback Stephen Carr remains out as he recovers from back surgery. He’s been ruled out for the entirety of spring practice. Senior Porter Gustin, who missed a majority of last season due to a toe injury, looked fully up to speed today. His burst and power looked just as strong as ever in bag drills and in the run defense segment of practice.
QB Competition
Although the Trojans still await the arrival of incoming five-star freshman JT Daniels, the battle to fill the void left by departing quarterback Sam Darnold continues. Redshirt freshman Jack Sears and redshirt sophomore Holden Thomas both looked solid, but redshirt sophomore Matt Fink still looks to be ahead of the pack as of now. 
Fink was sharp throughout the day, at one point completing three consecutive perfect post corner routes. He continued to display good decision making and accuracy throughout practice, not throwing a single pick and impressing in the team redzone portion of practice, where he used his trademark speed for a rushing touchdown while passing for two more. Although things may soon change upon Daniels’ arrival, Fink looks like the man to beat right now.
Standouts
The top two returning Trojan receivers both put on a show today, as redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns and junior Michael Pittman looked dominant throughout the day. Pittman caught nearly everything thrown his way, winning with speed on go routes and with his massive frame on crossing routes and hitches. His most impressive reception of the day came during team drills when he came back to an underthrown ball on a deep route, securing the grab as he hit the ground. 
Vaughns exhibited incredible route running and body control, as he caught pass after pass along the sideline, including a ridiculous grab in which he contorted his body 180 degrees through a defender to snag the football. Vaughns and senior cornerback Isaiah Langley got chippy with one another after executing a few routes together, exchanging verbal jabs and a few shoves as well. 
When asked about the interaction afterwards, Vaughns brushed it off, saying, “Yeah, that’s normal. Out of anger you’re gonna say stuff like that, but we’re still family, still teammates, so none of that stuff matters off the field.”
State of the Running Game
With the departure of star running back Ronald Jones II to the NFL, there are big shoes to be filled in the backfield. Carr looked explosive when he was on the field last year, but his absence for the spring leaves the starting tailback job wide open. Redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai impressed with his carries, providing a lot of powerful running to the backfield, while senior Aca’Cedric Ware also took a significant number of touches at running back. Redshirt junior Dominic Davis also joined the rotation, switching back to his original position after a stint as cornerback. The unit believes new running backs coach Tim Drevno has made a positive impact so far. 
“[Drevino] knows what he’s talking about all around,” Malepeai said. “He does a good job of making sure we understand how the entire play works and not just our assignments.”

Trevor Denton | Daily Trojan
For USC basketball, it was a season tainted by mishap after mishap. 
It all started with assistant coach Tony Bland’s arrest by the FBI in September. He, along with 10 other coaches and sports agents, was charged with facilitating bribes to prospective players. Bland was fired in January after a lengthy internal investigation. 
The season ended with an embarrassing second-round exit from the NIT on Monday. 
When the Bland rumors started brewing before the season even started, head coach Andy Enfield tried to save face and lead a loaded squad into a highly anticipated campaign. But where there was smoke, there was simply too much fire. 
Standout sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton was tangled in the mess from the very beginning. Reports indicated that a close family friend may have received a $5,000 payment from a sports agent. USC kept him out all season as a precautionary measure, and then outright suspended him in January, despite Melton himself never actually being accused of any wrongdoing. 
Players such as junior forward Chimezie Metu reacted acrimoniously to the news and tension mounted. Melton promptly left the program for good, and started preparing for the NBA Draft. Incoming five-star recruit Taeshon Cherry — who may have also been paid at some point — saw the turmoil and flipped his commitment from USC to Arizona State. 
Fast forward to last month, when Metu and fellow junior forward Bennie Boatwright were also alleged to have received improper benefits, according to a Yahoo Sports report. Unlike Melton, they were never ruled ineligible by the USC athletic department, but it hardly mattered. Boatwright suffered a season-ending knee injury in February and Metu decided not to play in the second round of the NIT Tournament, electing to preserve himself for the NBA Draft, for which he will certainly declare. 
At times it did seem like the Trojans’ play would quiet some of the off-court noise and make up for a year filled with headaches and shortcomings. They overcame a mediocre 9-4 start to the season, and began their first 10 Pac-12 contests with an impressive 8-2 mark. They even shook off a regular season finale loss to UCLA, and made it to the finals of the Pac-12 Tournament (where they eventually lost to top-seed Arizona, another school that’s dealt with its fair share of off-court troubles this season).
An NCAA Tournament berth seemed imminent. Runners-up in major conferences almost always land a spot in the big dance. But USC was snubbed, instead relegated to the NIT, while Pac-12 ninth place finisher Arizona State and third place UCLA made it, only to lose in the First Four. 
At first, I was angry about USC not earning a bid in the tournament. I tried to rationalize why they didn’t make it, arguing that the committee harbored an agenda against teams with spotty off-the-court reputations (Oklahoma State and Louisville, two teams with impressive resumes, but potential sanctions on the way, were also left out). When Arizona State and UCLA lost in play-in games, I was downright furious. 
But after USC lost to Western Kentucky 75-79 in the second round of the NIT Tournament on Monday, I no longer have anything to be angry about. For all of their off-court issues, the Trojans possessed an equal number of on-the-court problems. All season, they frequently blew late leads, shot inconsistently and mismanaged the clock. It all culminated in their final loss of the season, in which USC blew a lead with just under three minutes left. In a tournament USC supposedly had no business being in, the team still fell short.
As a result, the program no longer has to worry about the NCAA vacating wins if they find that the Trojans fielded ineligible players, because USC won nothing of any substance this year. There was little to show for all the pre-season hype and subsequent strife. Only more disappointment layered atop disappointment. 
Now, the future looks bleak for USC basketball, just as it did when Enfield arrived at a downtrodden program back in 2013. 
Next year, there won’t be burgeoning stars like Melton or Cherry to count on to lead the team into a new generation. Senior guards Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart, who led USC to three consecutive NCAA Tournaments, won’t be there to provide their steady veteran leadership. And of course, Boatwright and Metu, the team’s most talented players, will be nowhere to be found. They’ll be competing in the NBA, far, far away from the threat of NCAA punishment. It’s almost surprising Metu didn’t get his foot out of the door any sooner. 
As USC heads into next season, they sit in no man’s land — even if sanctions don’t cripple the program, the Trojans will have trouble replenishing enough talent to be competitive, and Enfield’s job security will be called into question regardless. Freshman forward Jordan Usher and sophomore guards Derryck Thornton and Jonah Mathews showed flashes of brilliance in 2017-18, but they will all have to take significant leaps for the Trojans to be competitive in the near future. 
So, this could be the end of another agonizingly short period of success for USC basketball. It would be convenient to blame the NCAA, Bland, or the tournament committee for not giving the Trojans a chance. 
But the team beat itself this season, just as it did on Monday.
