Student Health is urging students to pick up at-home antigen test kits ahead of spring break to test themselves before and after travel. The recommendation comes as the Food and Drug Administration announced Friday that it approved the first at-home test kit for both coronavirus and influenza. Student Health plans to closely monitor the distribution of the kit, but has no current plans to alter the distribution of antigen tests on campus, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a briefing with the Daily Trojan Tuesday.
According to the FDA, the single-use test is administered with a self-collected nasal swab and is intended for use by people aged 14 or older, or by adults collecting samples from children aged 2 or older. Results are usually provided in 30 minutes. However, Lucira Health, the company that developed the at-home test kits for coronavirus and flu, filed for bankruptcy after it said the FDA unexpectedly protracted the emergency-use authorization process for its product. It remains unclear when a combined test kit — the first of its kind — will be widely available to consumers.
“We’re not making any immediate change in our distribution of antigen tests,” Van Orman said. “It is something we could potentially make, kind of a change here as that comes on market.”
Van Orman said that having self-tests widely available would be especially helpful to those at high risk for coronavirus or influenza, allowing them to test early on to treat the virus and reduce the chance of spreading it to others.
“There is a reason to actually treat them with antivirals particularly early on and that can reduce their risk of having subsequent bad health conditions. It can also shorten the course of disease,” Van Orman said. “The other thing about both the influenza virus and the [coronavirus] is they’re really important infection control issues.”
Treatment for influenza is ideally administered within 24 hours of virus incubation. By the time most people test themselves for flu, Van Orman said, it is too late for treatment, which is why influenza medication is rarely administered.
Van Orman said she hopes the advent of coronavirus and influenza testing kits will help ease the lag between virus incubation and self-testing and reduce hospitalization rates for both diseases.
In addition to antigen kit testing, Van Orman urged students to beware of foodborne illnesses and practice safe sex.
“We see a lot of students come back with traveler’s diarrhea from Mexico and other locations … we also know a lot of students might have new partners during spring break, so making sure they’re carrying condoms with them and to make sure they’re tested when they get back,” Van Orman said. “Get caught up on your sleep. Lots of spring break reminders to just kind of be aware of things you could do to protect your health.”

Divya Jakatdar and Michelle Lu will be the 2023-24 Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president. At Tuesday night’s Senate meeting, the chair of the elections commission Omar Habhab announced the results of the 2023-24 USG election. Of the 4,105 votes cast by Trojans during this election, Jakatdar and Lu received 1,565 votes, 38.12% of the total.
Jakatdar and Lu ran their campaign with the slogan “We will ACT. ACT for You, ACT for SC” — ACT being an acronym for “Accessibility and Affordability, Community and Transparency.”
“We have a lot of short-term and long-term goals,” Lu said in an interview with the Daily Trojan after the meeting Tuesday. “Before putting everything on [our campaign], we definitely had conversations about every single point that we had on our platform. So now we just want to see what we can do short term and push them all out immediately and what we can do long term.”
With Jakatdar and Lu’s victory, this is the third consecutive year USG will have women as president and vice president, following Hannah Woodworth and Nivea Krishnan this past year and Alexis Areias and Lucy Warren in 2021-22. Overall voter turnout was 7.7% lower than last year, when 4,451 votes were cast in the 2022-2023 USG election — with 2,453 going to the Woodworth-Krishnan ticket.
“They all really made us feel like this is something that we could do,” Jakatdar said. “And I think it’s definitely true that seeing people similar to you in some way makes you believe that you can do something. But I think it also makes us feel good about how we’re gonna be able to reshape the culture in the office.”
Emilia Bletsas, McKayla Dorantes, Isabella Padilla, Julianna Melendez, Rudra Saigal, Bryan Fernandez, Brandon Tavakoli, Jake Zober, Halle Schaffer, Andrea Velazquez, AnnaOliva Schwedt and Matthew Speier were also announced as the senators-elect for the 2023-24 school year.
“It was a very nerve-wracking process,” Jakatdar said. “I think it’s been a very intense month … So many props to everyone who was a part of this, those who ran, who turned out to vote, but especially the candidates, every single candidate worked so hard. We’re honored … [and] also feeling very grateful with how many votes we received but honestly, just the fact that that many people voted, in general, was just the most inspiring thing.”
Prior to the announcement, chief financial officer Brian Stowe summarized the budget reallocation process from the last month. Three hundred and sixty organizations applied for funding this year, Stowe said.
During the process, the committee reallocated $42,000 from the Philanthropy Fund to three other funds. They gave $7,000 to the Performing and Visual Arts Fund, $7,000 to the Professional and Academic Research Funds and $28,000 to the Social & Recreation and Startup Funds.
Additionally, the committee will reallocate $4,000 from the Political Student Assembly, $6,000 from the Service Student Assembly, $6,000 from the Special Events Committee, $2,000 from the Transfer Student Assembly and $2,000 from the Student Assembly for Accessibility. From the funds, $10,000 each will be allocated to the Middle Eastern and North African Student Assembly and the Joint Assembly for Military-Associated Students.
Chief programming officer Jillian Fallon announced the nomination of Hailey Pham, a freshman majoring in political science, to be the Political Student Assembly assistant director, and speaker of the Senate Alvaro Flores announced the appointment of Tyler Fischer, a freshman majoring in economics, as the academic affairs chair.
Chief of staff Diego Andrades said he is in the process of finalizing cabinet guidelines and memos for the next USG administration to make a detailed transition.
“We are very much going to prioritize bringing in students who are passionate about those same core values and what projects fall in line with them,” Jakatdar said. “I really think that one of the … driving forces for getting anything done in USC is having people who care, so that’s gonna be a big part of the execution.”

My K-pop TikTok feed, a safe space for me that usually consists of cheap idol edits or over-the-top-detailed song and outfit rankings, was bombarded with clips of MAVE’s debut release, “PANDORA.” 
MAVE (메이브) is a girl group under Metaverse Entertainment that consists of four 19- and 20-year-old members: SIU (시우), ZENA (제나), MARTY (마티) and TYRA (타이라). The girls are all Korean, and most of them (apart from SIU) are bilingual. Their stage performances are energetic, and they move with almost robotic precision. Their audience is lively during their shows. At a quick glance, all seems well and normal; That is, until you squeegee your glasses and squint your eyes. 
The girls aren’t real. 
Every single aspect of their being is AI — artificial intelligence. It’s obvious once you watch for more than five seconds; the way they move is a little too rigid, their hair just seems a little too shiny and their facial expressions and breathing are a little too at ease for a full-out performance. It’s actually quite funny to think that the people in the audience — who, unlike the idols on stage, are real people — are actually just watching empty space that is later edited to include the girls.
I had no idea that this group was even going to debut because I just didn’t care. When æspa (에스파), another girl group, debuted in 2020, I was not very amused with their parent company, SM Entertainment’s, decision to create AI counterparts for the four members, especially as they appeared in music videos, stages and promotions. 
By counterparts I mean exactly what MAVE is now, just part-time. Each of the four girls had an AI figure that matched their physical characteristics and were essentially created to enhance the group’s nuance and contribute to an ever-growing storyline. 
I understand that the company was likely trying to set its new girl group apart and engender new conceptualization, but the AI never added anything. Honestly, it just felt like a cop-out because SM knew that æspa wasn’t as strong at performing as other groups under their name. 
For some reason, this new trend in K-pop makes my blood absolutely boil, and the fact that people are promoting MAVE on social media and following and liking their content upsets me greatly. These girls are programmed to be perfect; they have no human emotion, no story, no inherent talent and no personality. And yet, rather naively, people are falling in love with their “originality.” 
It honestly feels like K-pop was just recently able to make a positive name for itself within the past few years because of to BTS’ success and the amount of groups’ world tours traversing across the United States and the rest of the Western world. But with this new technological development, it feels like the music, concepts and fandoms are being thrown back into the “Dark Ages,” where K-pop fans were labeled as cringey or overly zealous, fiending over daydreams that had no foundation in reality (no, you will not be marrying your fav). But at least those idols were real. 
It honestly feels ridiculous to even have to be writing about such an issue. Can someone explain to me why MAVE has more than 150,000 Instagram followers? Why does “PANDORA” have 16 million views on YouTube? What is there even to watch? And God, please justify the fact that they have an actual album design and preview (although I can’t seem to find anywhere to purchase it, which is for the better). 
I usually love to tote K-pop because of its performative value and adherence to perfectionism (before it becomes toxic). Similarly, you often can’t help but fall in love with the idols and their personalities, their abilities and even their imperfections. You just don’t get that with artificial intelligence. 
On a more serious note that diverts from the standard engagement issues, there are rising concerns about the idols’ safety as well, and how this AI technology and its wide-scale availability can inadvertently hurt the real performers it aims to encapsulate. As virtual sex crimes and deepfake porn continue to rise online, controlling their spread and identifying problematic sites in the first place is becoming more and more difficult.
According to an article published in the Korea Times in 2021, “In the case of [æspa], the human members share the same identities as their virtual avatars, so if their digital selves fall victim to digital sex crimes … the human members are also likely to be affected.”
Although it is true that normal, real celebrities have fallen victim to these illegal porn forums, it could be argued that already proposing these idols in a virtual format invites people to alter their movement, facial expressions and more.
There is a real issue with artificial technology that replaces humans in the entertainment industry. In my eyes, it’s ridiculous, and should stop before it gains any traction, if it hasn’t already. It’s honestly an embarrassment to the K-pop world and a slap in the face to all the idols who trained for so many years only to be surpassed by a blank stage.

With midterm season approaching, it’s more important than ever to find time to avoid burnout by recharging and relaxing — perhaps by enjoying some of the thousands of great shows available across platforms. Here are some of the hottest titles from each streaming service to grace your screens this month, featuring the long-anticipated returns of some of the best shows on TV!
HBO Max
“Succession” Season 4 — March 26
The Roys are back in town in the long-awaited fourth — and final (nooooooo!) — season of the acclaimed HBO power trip epic. Picking up right where the explosive third season finale left off, this season will see the ruthless media mogul family’s infighting reach a new height as Shiv (Sarah Snook), Roman (Kieran Culkin) and Kendall (Jeremy Strong) band together against their father Logan “L to the OG” Roy (Brian Cox) in what’s sure to be an incendiary coup de grace. With showrunner Jesse Armstrong telling the New Yorker that the series will end strong, and Strong — who has picked up quite the reputation, even among co-stars, for his commitment to the role — saying that the show ending will “feel like a death,” it’s sure to be an exciting road to the finish line. 
Disney+
“The Mandalorian” Season 3 — March 1
Daddy of the decade Pedro Pascal dons his Mandalorian armor once again in this third season of the acclaimed “Star Wars” series. When we last saw them in “The Book of Boba Fett,” (2021) Grogu had reunited with Din Djarin (Pascal) after a brief trip to Luke Skywalker’s Jedi Academy. This season will explore the iconic duo as they travel to Mandalore, where Din will have to confront his past transgressions and relationship with the Mandalorians — he did de-mask after all. With old friends like Peli Motto (Amy Sedaris) and Greef Karga (Carl Weathers, who is also directing an episode this season) returning, as well as a larger scope of characters as teased by co-creator Jon Favreau, it’s sure to be an action-packed season that will have “Star Wars” fans bubblier than the lava pits of Mustafar.
Apple TV+
“Ted Lasso” Season 3 — March 15
Bust out some biscuits because the award-winning, feel-good comedy is finally back with its third outing (as they like to say across the pond). Rumored to be the last, season 3 will tackle Jason Sudeikis’ fan-favorite football coach as he deals with the fallout of both his personal and professional lives after Nate’s (Nick Mohammed) betrayal at the end of Season 2. With his team, AFC Richmond, facing ridicule at the beginning of the season for being last in the Premier League, and this being the end of a planned three-season arc, could the wanker come out on top and win this thing? Believe!
“Extrapolations” — March 16
If you would rather wallow in humanity’s self-destructive nature, there’s “Extrapolations,” a not-so-dystopian drama anthology series from the mind of Scott Burns that will tackle “how our planet’s changing climate will affect family, work, faith — and survival.” Featuring a slew of A-list stars from Meryl Streep — who could win her fourth Emmy for the series — to Tobey Maguire, it is sure to get people talking.
Prime Video
“Daisy Jones and the Six” — March 3
Prime Video’s upcoming “Daisy Jones and the Six,” a limited series adaptation of the bestselling Taylor Jenkins Reid novel by the same name, is already creating buzz. Set in 1970s Los Angeles, the show will follow the eponymous band as it tries to figure out the reasons for its sudden breakup years before. Starring Riley Keough — Elvis Presley’s granddaughter — and teen-heartthrob-turned-dramatic-actor Sam Claflin, it’s bound to be a viral sensation. Groovy!
Paramount+
“Survivor” Season 44 — March 1
Come on in! Jeff Probst is itching to snuff some torches and send castaways packing in the 44th installment of the iconic reality franchise. Continuing on with the grueling 26-day format first necessitated by the pandemic but which has lended the show a surprising vitality, this season will feature tons of new twists and turns including a chaotic new hidden idol twist called the “idol cage,” the complexity of which can’t be done justice here. Bring on the blindsides!

Right now is a disconcerting time for artists. Recent developments in generative artificial intelligence have sent tremors through academic and creative circles around the world. From powerful chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s new Bing search engine to image generators like Craiyon and Midjourney, the distinction between human and machine has become increasingly blurred. From this landscape of uncertainty, a series of questions have emerged: What does it mean to be creative? Is AI derivativeness really much different from the human artistic process? What is the place of the computer in the world of art?
Auspiciously coinciding with this digital reckoning is a new exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, “Coded: Art Enters the Computer Age, 1952-1982.” Curated by LACMA’s Leslie Jones, this collection of more than 100 pieces explores the incorporation of digital technology into art in the earliest days of the computer. Before the revolution of the PC, the mainframe dominated popular understanding of digital technology, capturing the attention of many creators active during the period. “Coded” displays the many artistic manifestations of this preoccupation with the computer.
The exhibition is organized into six sections, roughly advancing in chronological order. Curated to construct a sense of progression in the capabilities of computer technology and humanity’s fascination with it, the show presents art that is often overlooked or disregarded, now with a new gravity and relevance. As Jones notes in the exhibition advisory, “‘Coded’ brings to light early digital or ‘computer art’ that has long been overlooked, recontextualizing it to encourage a new way of looking at mainstream art of the period.”
Entering the exhibition, one is greeted by Edward Kienholz’s 1965 work “The Friendly Grey Computer — Star Gauge Model #54,” a strangely anthropomorphic piece that reimagines the mainframe in organismic terms. The metal casing, outfitted with large, eye-like dials and doll legs protruding in front, represents an early attempt to humanize the computer. From the outset, this piece demonstrates the tensions involved in artistic endeavors aimed at uncovering the technological mystique.
Proceeding into further sections of the show, the relative accessibility of this exhibition quickly dissipates. With the paradoxical circumstances of the relationship between art and computer technology established, “Coded” turns toward exploration of the various implications of the digital movement, from aesthetics to epistemology to politics. 
Frederick Hammersley’s collections of “computer drawings” from 1969 play into the presentation of those implications. Using the program Art1, one of the first programs designed for computer artists, Hammersley created an array of printed images using only alphanumeric characters. Feeding his designs into an IBM mainframe, a printer produced rectangular renderings of various pictures — like his “SCALLOP POTATOES.” The construction of images from such fundamental units as letters, numbers and symbols demonstrates the emergence of new types of artistic expression and talent, while also challenging  preconceptions of the ontological qualities of artwork.
Even then, Hammersley seems to constitute one of the tamer figures presented in the collection. In particular, the pieces of Vera Molnár and Harold Cohen represent deep exploration of the possibilities of art through the computer. Molnár’s “À la recherche de Paul Klee,” as the title suggests, draws influence from Klee’s 1927 “Variations.” In her “Searching for Paul Klee,” Molnár programmed horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines into the computer, producing  geometric figurations strongly resembling the original 1927 piece. 
Cohen’s works relied on the use of his AI drawing program named AARON, which — combined with the “turtle” drawing mechanism — could autonomously produce new images. One of his pieces displayed in “Coded” is entitled “74D10.” The abstract computer drawing of various amorphous shapes, hand-embellished with color by Cohen, evokes a strange sense of familiarity, perhaps with a resemblance to Kandinsky. The deceptive semblances of humanity in Cohen’s work give strong reason for reflection on the nature of the artistic process.
“Coded” is an exhausting exhibition. Even though it only covers 30 years, the collection represents a true odyssey, using its large breadth of works to engage in a profound artistic discourse. Curiously, as one leaves the gallery, they must again pass by Kienholz’s “Friendly Grey Computer.” The uncanny sense of humanity and life emitted from the work becomes extraordinarily poignant after the digestion of the rest of the show. With its unflinching “eyes,” the work seems to beckon for friendship and cooperation, eager to partner in the creation of beautiful art. As Kienholz’s eccentric computer demonstrates, “Coded” focuses not on the potential dangers of AI, but rather the exciting new frontiers it presents.
“Coded” is on display at LACMA until July 2. Students can receive an admission discount with the presentation of a valid student ID.

From its roots to present day, Los Angeles has become known as the entertainment capital of the world. Yet, hidden under its glitz and glamor, the overwhelming crisis of homelessness has grown worse and become a focal point of the national dialogue around the issue. With one of the largest unhoused populations in the United States, according to U.S. News, L.A. has close to 70,000 homeless individuals living on the streets. A dire situation like this needs urgent attention from city officials and the public alike.
Homelessness is not simply just a problem in Los Angeles, but a national issue that has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. From widespread job loss to income shortages and lack of affordable housing, the consequences the pandemic has had on homelessness are shown by the daily increase in the number of unhoused individuals all throughout the city.
The impacts of homelessness are not only felt by those who are within this population, but also by a wider community. As a result of their needs, homeless individuals may seek medical and mental health services, and this strains the healthcare system. 
However, in reality, most cannot find the help they need, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shown that homelessness is highly connected with cases of HIV infection, drug abuse and other conditions that are not being properly addressed given the barriers to care and limited available resources. Homelessness has also shown to induce criminal activity, which can lead to higher crime rates in particular areas. Furthermore, according to the Los Angeles Times, “By looking at the rate of homeless per 1,000 people, they found communities with the highest housing costs had some of the highest rates of homelessness, something that might be overlooked when looking at just the overall raw number of homeless people.”
The current misconceptions of homelessness not only impacts those who are currently unhoused, but also those are currently living in areas with high rates of homelessness. The issue isn’t with the unhoused population, the issue is the lack of affordable housing and the limited actions we’ve been taking to fully address the issue. 
For a long time now, city officials have attempted to address the issues of homelessness in Los Angeles through multiple efforts, especially with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority helping fund local outreach events like food banks, creating housing programs and building emergency shelters. However, various downstream levels of effort throughout the city have fallen short in truly fixing the roots of homelessness, which involve poverty, mental health and drug-related issues and other upstream factors.
To effectively combat this issue in L.A., a more comprehensive and coordinated approach that involves non-profit organizations, private businesses and the public can be used to drive progress in developing better job opportunities, more access to healthcare and health services, more affordable housing, and ultimately addressing the root causes of homelessness. It is important to also bring into discussion the stigma that surrounds homelessness and to emphasize the need to view unhoused individuals as people who deserve support, respect, and dignity just like everyone else. It is through awareness campaigns and meaningful education through which others can understand how to express compassion to those simply finding a place to call home.
At USC, the Undergraduate Student Government can play a role in addressing homelessness through various approaches, such as advocating policy changes, raising awareness and organizing fundraisers or volunteer activities. In fact, student organizations such as the Service Student Assembly and Trojan Shelter have organized events allowing for students to help volunteer in helping the needs of the homeless population within the community. But beyond USC, students can be part of organizations in Los Angeles, such as Meals on Wheels West, Food on Foot and The Midnight Mission. These organizations provide a range of assistance, from food banks to emergency shelters, and rely on volunteers and donations to combat homelessness.
In all, L.A.’s growing crisis of homelessness, and all sectors of society can work together to coordinate immediate action. It is through our own communities where we can work together in finding solutions that benefit everyone, including homeless individuals. Although there have been past efforts by both USC and its students, there should be more highly-encouraged systems to donate unused food and meal swipes to shelters in the Los Angeles area. Pushing for our administration as well as our student government representatives to create better outlets to truly give back to those in need in our area is one step forward. Similarly, there are also clubs and organizations on campus that dedicate their time and resources to community outreach like the USC Volunteer Center, a group that hosts events that serve both the student body and the community, with events like Friends & Neighbors Day, where students are introduced to a plethora of non-profit organizations that they are invited to volunteer with.
Amidst the sounds of the bustling city of Los Angeles, the spread of homelessness is a mere representation of the systematic failures and societal neglect present in this world, but through our own capabilities, we can bring a sense of belonging to those who have been long forgotten in the shadows behind the bright lights and dreams of L.A.

Content warning: This article contains references to racial violence and insensitivity.
This is, without a doubt, the hardest piece I’ve ever attempted to write. How do I argue a position that feels as natural to me as breathing? But, before we debate the importance of an undiluted education, I want to illustrate our current reality of crushing ignorance.
As an English major, I studied the same handful of white men over and over and over again, trying to breathe new life into stale words with each interpretive essay I wrote. In high school, I sat shaking with anger as my Advanced Placement English classmates argued that police had no choice but to profile Black people.
“They don’t have the time to treat everyone as a suspect,” one of my peers claimed.
After my family left Albuquerque for a neighboring rural town, I was relieved when I discovered a new friend. Until, during an ice cream run, she said, unprompted, “Did you know slavery wasn’t actually that bad?” Her Catholic school had taught her “all about how the North blew the issue of slavery out of proportion.” 
One of the most repeated mantras at my high school was, “Everyone is born with equal opportunity to succeed.” The first time I heard it, I thought it was a joke. Then multiple teachers echoed the sentiment. And suddenly it wasn’t funny anymore. How could anyone think that we are all born with an equal chance, that success is built on nothing but effort? What about generational wealth, institutional racism, classism, sexism or ableism? 
These ignorant beliefs are dangerous. They fuel destructive biases, misconceptions and prejudice. The ignorance I have observed all my life isn’t just ubiquitous, and it isn’t just suffocating — it’s stagnating. It keeps us rooted in a manufactured, oppressive environment with a thin veneer that tries to trick society into believing that it wasn’t manmade at all. That “Everyone is born with equal opportunity to succeed.”
The College Board created an opportunity to learn Black studies, but already the program appears to be in jeopardy. The framework of the AP African American studies pilot program has shifted significantly since it received fierce resistance from, most vocally, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and other notable conservative politicians. Certain topics and individuals were either relegated to optional coursework or cut from the program entirely. This includes intersectionality, Black queer studies, the Black Lives Matter movement and figures like Angela Davis and bell hooks. However, the College Board is insistent that the backlash had nothing to do with the changes.
Whether these topics were removed because of politics or not, the result is the same: the curriculum has changed for the worse. I understand that it is impossible to encapsulate Black history and culture into a single course. But the newest framework is not a step in the right direction. A former teacher and current lead curator of the nonprofit organization We Are, Ronda Taylor Bullock, tells The Guardian “The changes that are happening aren’t edits – they’re the erasure of Black voices, Black academics, Black experiences. It’s cowering to white supremacy, cowering to political power, versus recognizing the academic merits of how the curriculum was from the beginning.”
When I first read about the pilot program, I rejoiced at the idea of an AP African American studies course. But when I thought about why it was necessary at all, my joy soured slightly. I am still very happy that the program has been created and proud of the people who worked hard for its development. But why are students not being properly taught Black history and Black voices in the general curriculum?
I think we all know why. Because white comfort and privilege were and are valued above an education that accurately represents this nation. Society’s racial ignorance isn’t accidental — it’s a direct product of opposing progress and institutional change. 
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy elected to add more New Jersey schools to the AP African American studies pilot program in direct response to Gov. DeSantis’ opposition, according to the New York Times. 
“We’re Americans standing up. We’ve got to tell the whole story of our country,” Gov. Murphy said. 
This is the appropriate response. Not to capitulate, but to stand firm.
Change and progress often hinge on a certain level of discomfort. And despite ongoing efforts to prevent any modicum of discomfort, I hope the new AP African American studies program makes students, teachers and parents alike uncomfortable.

Although this is only Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb’s second year at USC, she has completely turned around the women’s basketball program, as the Trojans now sit at 21-8 overall and 11-7 in the Pac-12. She has led the Trojans to their best record through 29 games since the 1993-94 season, when the Trojans were 26-3. Her philosophy relies heavily on senior leadership, which emerges primarily through graduate guard Destiny Littleton, graduate forward Kadi Sissoko and graduate guard Rokia Doumbia. Gottlieb spoke with the Daily Trojan about what it took for this transformation to happen so quickly.
“Just for all of us to buy in and try and change the culture, start a new legacy,” Gottlieb said. “There’s such a rich history here that we value and it gives me motivation every day.”
Last year, the Trojans ended their season in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament in a 73-60 loss to rivals UCLA, a game that marked their 16th loss of the year. After the season concluded, the Trojans lost a significant percentage of their scoring as forwards Jordyn Jenkins and Jordan Sanders moved on from the program. Jenkins and Sanders led the team in scoring, with 14.8 and 12.4 points per game, respectively. 
Over recent years, NCAA basketball has succumbed to the creation of the transfer portal, which allows players to transfer from school to school without losing eligibility. While many people believe that the transfer portal is affecting the integrity of the game, Gottlieb took advantage of the transfer portal by bringing in a whopping six transfers: Littleton, Sissoko and Doumbia, as well as graduate guard Okako Adika, redshirt freshman guard Taylor Bigby, junior guard Kayla Williams and junior forward Koi Love. 
“I was excited about [bringing in so many transfers],” Gottlieb said. “It was a [new] group of people that were all talented but we had to come together. It’s been really incredibly fun. Hard, different, but I’m really grateful to this group that we have.”
Along with the retention of sophomore forward Rayah Marshall, who is third in the nation in blocks per game, the Trojans roster was stacked heading into what would be an outstanding regular season. Throughout the season, the Trojans racked up wins against heavyweight schools, most notably their major upset against then-ranked No. 2 Stanford at home and their domination of then-ranked No. 25 Colorado on the road. 
These wins were not the team’s only highlights of the year. Throughout the program’s transformation, USC’s defensive presence has allowed them to succeed in a highly competitive Pac-12 conference. During their upset over Stanford, the Trojans held the Cardinal to a season-low 46 points. Additionally, the Trojans have forced all of their opponents into 10 or more turnovers, except for during their matchup against UCLA in mid-December. 
Marshall’s paint presence has been huge for the Trojans, as she now sits at 89 blocks on the year and has now recorded at least one block in 49 consecutive games. On the offensive end, the Trojans are led by Littleton and Sissoko, who are averaging 15.6 and 13.9 points per game this season, respectively. Doumbia spoke about what it meant to have such strong senior leadership on the team this season.
“This is our last year and we are trying to take this program to the next level with [Gottlieb’s] help,” Doumbia said. “You have these seniors who are like ‘Okay, this is our last year, and we are going to do this. We are going to do this for each other, we are going to do this for our coaches, and we are going to do this for our fans.” 
After a 19-point comeback in their double-overtime victory Saturday afternoon against Washington State, the Trojans have proven that they have the ability to face adversity which will be crucial when the Pac-12 tournament begins Wednesday. This season, the Pac-12 features a total of five ranked teams, making for an exciting and competitive conference tournament, in which USC holds the sixth seed. They will play Oregon State, who they beat in both of their matchups earlier this year, on Wednesday in the first round. 
“To me, as we go into the Pac-12 tournament … everyone has played each other a million times, everyone knows each other’s stuff,” Gottlieb said. “It’s going to be about who is the most connected when they play, who can make adjustments, who can find another gear.” 
The Trojans will play Oregon State Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament in Las Vegas.

It’s finally March! And you know what that means … spring break is right around the corner!
Regardless of how this semester has been, I’m sure all of you, dear readers, have been looking forward to it. I am no exception. I’ve been counting down the days almost religiously. You see, this is the last spring break of my undergraduate life. Yes, I am one of those who will finally graduate this May (if my dear professors allow it) and say goodbye to USC. So this coming spring break, more than just a well sought-after rest, also carries a certain sentimentality. 
Some of you may be wondering if I have anything planned for it. After all, it’s not unusual for people in my situation to go “all out” before joining the adult world for good. And I’m happy to say that I have something I’m looking forward to doing. Throughout that entire week, I’ll be … holed up at home trying to beat “Celeste”’s chapter 9.
Sorry for those with greater expectations for me (my parents included). I just can’t shake off my love for video games, even when faced with my last spring break. But, for anyone who loves games as much as I do, you’d probably understand my decision better if you played “Celeste.”
For those who don’t know what I’m talking about, “Celeste” is a popular 2018 indie game with a synopsis as straightforward as they come: You control Madeline, a first-time climber, as she tries to reach the peak of Celeste mountain. Along the way, you’ll meet fellow travelers and learn more about what makes Celeste mountain so hard to climb in the first place. But even as you unearth some mysteries about the world and yourself, the ultimate goal never really changes, only your approach and perspective about it. And because of that, “Celeste” manages to maintain a narrative grip not usually seen in indie games of its kind. Attempting less allows more time to focus on its characters’ complexities, weaving it through the story while never feeling overbearing. 
While “Celeste”’s story is certainly one of the reasons it became a massive hit, what I’d like to focus on today is the other element that led to its glory: the gameplay. 
Unlike other indie games released nowadays, which copy the same old formats or leave gameplay as an afterthought, “Celeste” does something different. Not only does it emulate platforming games like “Super Meat Boy,” a novelty in itself, but it expands on it, the mark of a truly great indie game. And let me tell you, it’s borderline a work of art. 
I’m not usually a fan of unforgiving games, but “Celeste” manages to make all the tough platforming of the genre worth it by absolutely cranking the lever on the mobility. Thanks to its dash system, it makes the player feel like they’re accomplishing something impossible in the coolest way imaginable. Of course, when you look at any video about the game on the internet, you’ll find that there are almost infinite “cooler” ways you could have accomplished that same objective. But that is the magic of “Celeste.” Its near-limitless skill ceiling allows gamers of any skill level to enjoy the game. 
So how does this relate to esports?
Yes, you knew this was coming. After all, as much as I love “Celeste,” I can’t help but think about my role as a columnist. Besides, since this is hardly the first time I had encountered a game with a high skill ceiling, I wondered what exactly made “Celeste” so special on a gameplay level, and how that might translate into games with a professional competitive scene. And I think the answer is, surprisingly, level design. 
If you like games, this is probably a concept you’ve heard about. But unlike story or core gameplay mechanics, level design isn’t apparent in most games unless you’re specifically looking out for it. Still, when considering why “Celeste” succeeds, it becomes clear that level design is a main element. 
After all, it’s hardly the first game to try incorporating speed, but thanks to its hand-crafted levels, it is one of the few that does so effectively. For example, their relative compactness, keeping the end goal in sight always, means players manage to visualize potential paths almost immediately upon entering a level. This avoids the frustration of not knowing what to do and allows gamers to put all their effort into trying to accomplish the feat. 
The slow incorporation of new concepts also eases players, avoiding unnecessary difficulty spikes and ensuring whenever a particularly challenging level appears, players feel ready to tackle them. By the end, “Celeste” feels confident enough about the player’s skill level to “let go” of their hand a bit more, giving them more freedom when it comes to finishing the levels. 
This principle is what is transferable to esports. Unlike single-player games like “Celeste,” competitive games cannot shape players’ experiences. In fact, they’re encouraged to let the players run wild as much as possible. However, thanks to the lessons from “Celeste,” we can realize that one of the factors that influences the success of a competitive game is, clearly, its level design. 
Take for example competitive tactical shooters like “Valorant” and “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.” While there are many reasons why those games are successful, their stages are intentionally designed to provide a fun and exciting tactical experience. Because all of the work in creating a powerful experience is laid out on a non-interactable element, it manages to accommodate for the various differing skill levels present in players. This means that both newcomers and pros can enjoy matches on the very same grounds, the only thing separating them being their skill level. 
That sounds obvious, but you’d be surprised at how many games fail to recognize just how exactly to make competition solely about skill. And while level design is certainly not the only way to create that, it at least avoids an ineffective “top-down” approach, where developers impose restrictions to try and level out the playing field. Instead of accomplishing a skill-based game, they just muddle up the experience for everyone. 
But as “Celeste” proves, having a comprehensive level design that plays right into your intended gameplay mechanic, while certainly harder to achieve, is the way to make sure your game succeeds on a fundamental level. And if an indie studio, with significantly fewer resources and manpower, managed to clear that hurdle, then the big studios have no excuse not to. After all, while they may have a mountain to climb, the summit makes it all worth it.

Last Monday and Tuesday, the USC Ski & Snowboard club team competed in the Southwest Regional Championships at Mammoth Mountain and qualified for the National Championships. The national competition, sponsored by the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA), draws student-athletes from more than 175 colleges and universities and will take place from March 6-11.
While USC performed well at the regional qualifiers, regionals presented a more difficult challenge.
“We had competitions at Mt. High and China Peak, but both of those resorts were very small,” said Head Coach and senior Nick Ford. “It’s a different feeling when you’re at Mammoth surrounded by a bunch of people and intimidating terrain, parks and races. All that is a new echelon of high level.”
The Trojans were able to handle the obstacles well, with four athletes advancing to nationals in multiple events. For women’s snowboarding, junior Chloe Barker placed first in slalom, second in giant slalom and third in rail jam. Graduate student Gelo Winings placed first in rail jam, twelfth in giant slalom and fourteenth in slalom for men’s snowboarding. Junior snowboarder Jesse Tennant placed 10th in giant slalom, 17th in slalom and 24th in rail jam. In the men’s skiing rail jam event, Ford placed first, while junior Shane Cole placed third. Cole also finished third in slalom. All athletes who competed in rail jam also qualified for slopestyle at nationals. 
Tennant credits the team’s mindset going into regionals for their recent success. 
“Our motto for regionals this year was ‘nothing’s impossible,’” Tennant said. “We all fed off each other’s energy with that mindset, and we placed extremely well.”
Tennant also highlighted Barker’s performance. Barker went to nationals last year and is making an effort to support the rest of the athletes.
“[Barker] had some amazing energy to give to the team,” Tennant said. “She wasn’t supposed to do rail jam, but because slopestyle [at regionals] was canceled, she was kind of forced into it — which isn’t her discipline. But she went out there and threw some amazing tricks and energy, and fed it to the rest of the team.”
Looking forward, the team will travel to Mammoth again next week for nationals. Last year, though many qualified, only Barker and then-senior Ali Hsueh went to the national championships at Lake Placid. With strong qualifiers and Mammoth as their training ground, the team is feeling optimistic this year.
“It’s a major plus being on our home turf,” Winings said. “Some of the other schools competing with us may have been to Mammoth a couple times, but they don’t necessarily get reps on big jumps, rails and big mountain territory like we’re able to.”
Despite the advantage, Winings also acknowledged that competing at Mammoth doesn’t guarantee success.
“I’d say the biggest challenge is just staying dialed in, showing up for your event and doing what you need to do,” Winings said. “It’s definitely easy to get distracted out there.”
As a senior, this is Ford’s final season as a coach and athlete on the team. He’s looking ahead to his last attempt at a national championship with confidence.
“We have a great chance of not only doing well, but making a name for USC,” Ford said. “Right before I came to USC, I watched old videos of the team from almost 10 years prior. That was the first and only time our team was really doing well at these national competitions. So it’s cool that that life can come back — it was hibernating for a little bit. Now we’re reliving it.”
Ford spoke especially to the people who make up the team.
“We have a good crew, and a lot of people who are younger than me will continue to compete,” Ford said. “Hopefully, if I gave them anything, they’ll continue to kill it.”
With eyes on the prize and a strong record, the Trojans will test their skills for the final time this season on their home mountain next week at Nationals.
