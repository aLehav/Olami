After getting blown out by No. 1 Alabama to start the season, USC players and coaches kept reminding the media that their season would not be defined by one game. Now, following a 27-10 loss to No. 7 Stanford on Saturday on the road and another uninspiring defeat to a top-10 opponent, perhaps there is more clarity on how this season will be defined.
While not as lopsided as the Alabama loss, USC was outplayed by its conference foe, and drops to 1-2 on its young season.
Head coach Clay Helton, though, expressed optimism in his postgame statements.
“They took a giant leap forward in my mind the way they competed today,” he said. “We played two really good football teams in Alabama and Stanford in our losses. We’ve got to learn how to win those games and we will.”
Stanford star running back Christian McCaffrey, whom the Trojans keyed in on stopping after he torched USC in last season’s Pac-12 Championship Game, still finished with 260 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns.
USC struggled to convert on third down and with penalties. The Trojans committed false start after false start — six total, stalling progress on their offensive drives.
When asked about the false starts, redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne mentioned that the Stanford defensive line was “saying things” while he was in mid-cadence, and directed the question to redshirt senior offensive tackle Zach Banner. But Banner, a team captain, declined to speak with the media after the game.
“At times we were just stabbing ourselves in the foot towards the end of drives,” Browne said on the offensive struggles. “The name of the game is touchdowns, so we have to correct that and it’s a big thing moving forward.”
It wasn’t like USC didn’t have a chance. The Trojans had clawed within a touchdown with a quick score early in the second half, only to see the Cardinal answer with a field goal and a big play to seize momentum right back.
Up 20-10 midway through the third, the Cardinal ran a reverse, with senior quarterback Ryan Burns faking a handoff to McCaffrey before giving it to redshirt senior wide receiver Michael Rector, who sped around the wide-open left side for a 56-yard touchdown.
“We were playing the strong side of the formation really tight,” Helton said of the play. “We rolled down the strong safety there, and we’re a pursuit football team. We get to the ball and they caught us with a nice play call with the reverse.”
That proved to be the final blow for the Trojans, who could not convert on a fourth down play on their next drive and punted on fourth down from Stanford’s 44-yard line on the following possession with the clock ticking in the fourth quarter. Helton said after the game that he wanted to pin the Cardinal deep, especially with a weapon in McCaffrey.
Senior running back Justin Davis wanted to go for it, though, with his team down by 17 late in the game.
“Did we want to go for it?” he said. “Of course. We don’t like having to put the ball in Stanford’s hands. We were disappointed, but we still have our trust in coaches that they made the best decision possible.”
Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold played the final series of the game, which ended in an interception in the end zone.
“We’ve got to do a better job of finishing games and playing every quarter,” Darnold said. “We were down 17-3 at the half and guys [in the locker room] looked like the game was over. That’s something that cannot happen. We’ve got to change that.”
It turns out the game wasn’t over at halftime — yet.
After a stagnant first half offensively, the Trojans found the end zone quickly in the second half, taking just over three and a half minutes to drive 75 yards downfield. The big play was a 38-yard completion from Browne to wide-open sophomore tight end Tyler Petite, setting up first-and-goal from the 7-yard line.
Two plays later, sophomore running back Ronald Jones II punched in the score from one yard out to draw USC within a touchdown at 17-10.
The positive vibe, though, was short-lived, as Stanford scored the game’s final 10 points.
“We took a couple plays off here and there,” Davis said. “Even if we run the ball [well], we’ve still got to come back and execute the play after. We can’t have any mental lapses.”
Near the end of the half, the Cardinal jumped ahead by two touchdowns, with McCaffrey leaping for a touchdown on fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line, capping off a 57-yard drive to give Stanford a 17-3 lead into halftime.
At the half, McCaffrey had 101 yards on the ground, 72 yards receiving and 195 all-purpose yards.
After uneventful first drives, Stanford struck first midway through the first quarter on a 56-yard touchdown pass from Burns to McCaffrey after the Trojans failed to cover the other team’s best offensive weapon — McCaffrey appeared to run past sophomore defensive back Marvell Tell III, who let him go through.
“It’s one of those things, we didn’t know who’s [covering] who, and he scored,” junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson said.
McCaffrey said he was simply able to coast by the defense for the score.
“I don’t know what they were going to give me,” McCaffrey said. “I saw the safety roll down. It was my job to run by him. Burns threw a great ball and from there it’s history.”
The Trojans responded on the ensuing drive with a 47-yard field goal by redshirt junior Matt Boermeester. Stanford came back with a lengthy drive, but USC was able to limit the Cardinal to a field goal, fending off a red-zone opportunity.
It is another deflating loss in the early season for the Trojans, who dropped out of the AP Top 25 after a week and now find themselves in a bigger hole. Helton is also now 1-4 as the full-time head coach.
“It’s not fair for [Helton],” Davis said. “It really isn’t. For him to have his first year as full-time head coach of the Trojans, for us to perform like we did in those two losses, it hurts me.”
Jackson said he believes USC is on the same level as Stanford and Alabama, but the team is simply not capitalizing on its talent.
“We’ve just got to get back in the lab and get better,” Jackson said. “At the end of the day, it’s unacceptable. I didn’t come from a losing program. I’m not used to losing.”
USC has a quick turnaround, facing Utah on the road next Friday before playing four of its following five games at home.
delusional to think that you’re on the same level as Alabama and Stanford.  Not even close.  For one thing, you lack the desire. And then you don’t actually have the talent.  Good thing there are other Fall sports at USC.  This one is done.  Next!

Junior midfielder Sydney Sladek scored a goal as the Trojans defeated Kansas on Friday for their sixth straight win – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The No. 12 women’s soccer team defeated Kansas 2-0 at McAlister Field on Friday, extending their winning streak to six matches.
The Women of Troy faced a Jayhawks side that qualified for the Big 12 Championship game last year, but goals from sophomore striker Leah Pruitt and junior midfielder Sydney Sladek ensured USC kept rolling.
Both teams threatened in a back-and-forth first half, each creating a handful of scoring chances, but the opening 45 minutes finished scoreless. Barely a minute after the second-half restart, however, Pruitt broke the deadlock, smashing a long half-volley past Kansas goalkeeper Regan Gibbs.
Jayhawk center back Addisyn Merrick was unable to clear past Pruitt after freshman Ashleigh Plumptre stormed down the left wing and whipped a cross into the box. The sophomore transfer from San Diego State pounced on the loose ball and fired on-target from over 20 yards out for her first goal in Cardinal and Gold.
Pruitt described her maiden effort as a “good shot” after the game.
“I’m just really excited I got my first goal under my belt,” she said. “I’ve been trying to score a lot.”
The goal couldn’t have come at a better time, as Kansas had barely touched the ball in the second half before suddenly staring at a deficit — all after a relatively even first period.
“They’re coming out of the half…feeling good about themselves, so immediately, when you score like that, the momentum shifts,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “We could play a little bit more freely, not necessarily having to go get the goal, which I think helped open them up a bit.”
The Women of Troy continued to challenge the Jayhawk backline, but the defense remained disciplined after conceding. USC clung to its slim advantage until Sladek took advantage of another misfired Kansas clearance and slotted home with three minutes to go to seal the win.
After starting the season with consecutive losses at Santa Clara and Long Beach State, USC appeared in danger of squandering some of the program’s momentum from 2015, when the Women of Troy made a Sweet Sixteen run in the NCAA Tournament. But three weeks and six wins later, the team is sitting pretty: USC is currently ranked No. 12 in the nation, largely thanks to its 3-0 drubbing of No. 8 North Carolina last weekend.
Despite the admirable position, McAlpine isn’t satisfied.
“Today was a poor day for us in terms of our energy, our work rate, and executing the things we trained for,” he said. “However, it’s days like this when you start to believe in yourself a little bit because you had a bad day, but you found a win.”
McAlpine said he still considered the game a “step forward,” and he was bullish on the team’s position heading into USC’s conference opener next week. Even after a disappointing performance, the team has won six on the trot, and redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme hasn’t been beaten in over nine hours of soccer.
“It’s a reminder, sort of like the first two games of the year, that you still have to do the work, be disciplined, and be focused for every team you play,” McAlpine said. “Today was no different, and going into Pac-12 [play] adds a level of urgency now.”
The Women of Troy will look to extend their streak again next Friday, when Arizona visits McAlister Field for USC’s first Pac-12 matchup of the fall.
