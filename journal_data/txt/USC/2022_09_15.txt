The night before my freshman move-in day three years ago, instead of eating dinner with my family or reminiscing about my life back home before beginning my college career, I spent my evening at the (now) Crypto.com Arena at the annual KCON Los Angeles concert seeing my favorite K-pop group, Stray Kids, for the very first time. 
Three years later, it’s only fitting that the weekend before the first day of my senior year, I was back at the Crypto.com Arena for the same annual KCON LA concert. Again, I was here to see Stray Kids (except this concert would be my fourth time watching them perform), but I left with more than just them on my mind. 
Organized by Korean entertainment company CJ ENM, KCON LA is one of the many extensions of KCON — “the world’s largest fan celebration of Korean culture and music,” according to their website. Since its inception in L.A. in 2012, KCON has expanded to cities and countries worldwide, including New York, Japan and Saudi Arabia. Traditionally, the event brings various K-pop artists to the event’s city for a multiple-day convention and concert, including seasoned artists like NCT DREAM, WJSN and Stray Kids and rookie artists like ATBO, STAYC and TO1. 
Because of the wide range of K-pop artists KCON brings to each of its events, I wasn’t surprised to see a few unfamiliar names on the KCON 2022 LA concert lineup. So, as I do before every music festival I go to, I looked up each of the artists I didn’t know to familiarize myself with them and their music. Most of the artists I researched were the typical K-pop group, with Korean group members singing Korean lyrics. 
So, I was surprised to learn about INI and their inclusion on KCON’s lineup. I had never heard of the 11-member boy group before, even as an avid K-pop fan. Maybe it’s because the group debuted less than a year ago, or maybe it’s because none of the group’s members are ethnically Korean and all of their songs and content are delivered in Japanese. 
Formed on the Japanese version of popular Korean survival show “Produce 101,” INI follows the typical K-pop formula: sharp and synchronized dance moves, catchy songs with heavy beats and idols too handsome to be real — except all in Japanese. They’re also clearly intended for a Japanese audience, with all of their variety show appearances taking place on Japanese TV shows and all of their contents being delivered in Japanese. 
K-pop has always been massively popular in Japan, and the industry has taken advantage of this, with artists like BoA and TVXQ being marketed specifically for Japanese audiences during their prime. Even today, artists release albums with new Japanese language tracks and re-recordings of their popular Korean language songs in Japanese. Idols that are Japanese by nationality also aren’t uncommon in K-pop groups — TWICE, NCT and Kep1er all have multiple Japanese members. 
Personally, I’ve always found the relationship between K-pop and Japan really interesting. I’ve always identified with my Japanese background. I took Japanese language classes from the sixth grade until my freshman year of college, speak regularly with my family and friends who live in Japan and do my best to remain actively involved with the Japanese American community in L.A. 
Japanese songs such as BTS’s “Crystal Snow” and Stray Kids’ “Your Eyes” somehow feel familiar to me — with lyrics I can more easily sing along to. When I started to become a fan of TREASURE, it was easy to feel connected to my favorite member — who hails from Kobe, just an hour-long train ride from my ancestors’ roots in Hiroshima. When I watch videos of my favorite idols speaking in Japanese, I’m always pleasantly surprised to discover that I don’t need subtitles to understand the majority of what they’re saying. The presence of Japan in K-pop has always allowed me the unique opportunity to bridge a gap between my music taste and my ethnic background. 
But INI takes this to another extreme. Their music doesn’t consist of a singular re-recorded Japanese track thrown into a Korean language discography, or a singular Japanese national member in a group of Korean members. With only their artistry and marketing strategies showing touches of Koreanness, they occupy a strange place in the K-pop industry. It begs questions of whether or not groups like INI — that have no Korean members and don’t perform in Korean — should be considered K-pop at all. 
One can say that INI’s invitation to KCON, an event specifically created to highlight Korean culture and music, solidifies their place as a K-pop group. Yet, it could also be argued that a lack of Korean members and music renders the “K” in K-pop completely irrelevant. 
But I’m not here to start arguments about what should be included within the boundaries of the K-pop genre. 
Perhaps all I can do is thank KCON for bringing INI to their L.A. concert and showing me a new extension of my Japanese identity in the K-pop world. Seeing idols that share such a large piece of my personal identity on a stage as large as the Crypto.com Arena’s was a feat I never thought I’d witness — but one I’ll forever find value in.

It’s the 10-year anniversary of the final addition to USC’s six art schools. In 2012, the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance joined the School of Architecture, Roski School of Art and Design, School of Cinematic Arts, School of Dramatic Arts and Thornton School of Music to round out USC’s art colleges. The collection of programs ranked 84 — out of 600 — globally for best universities to pursue an arts and humanities degree in 2022, according to independent data site Times Higher Education.
This collection of schools sponsors a University-wide arts initiative: Visions and Voices. The program provides a transformative space and series of events for all USC students to experience. Launched in 2006, Visions and Voices prides itself on connecting individuals “regardless of their major” in various art programs and with USC’s art schools.
The irony of this initiative and the language they’ve chosen is that it couldn’t be further from the truth.
I’m a graduate student pursuing a Masters of Arts specialized in arts journalism at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. My one-year degree program is listed on USC Arts’ homepage in small writing; with one hyperlink at the bottom right corner. To graduate, it’s required to enroll in 9 to 14 elective units through two USC art schools. This degree path is all but explicitly regarded as an arts program at USC.
Why, then, was it so difficult to enroll in an art class as an “outside” student?
I was forced to shift my schedule around in week one of the fall semester, leaving me down an elective I needed to replace immediately. The perfect class was through Roski: It fit my schedule, my interests and had eight spots open for students to enroll. 
But what followed were three strikes that displayed the inaccessibility of art classes for non-arts majors. Strike one was when I emailed the professor about the class curriculum only to be told that only students could view the syllabus.
I then reached out to Roski’s advising team for help enrolling in the course only to CC the same professor. Strike two was being referred to as a “non-Roski” student twice, with that provided as the reason they wouldn’t allow me in the class.
“May I ask why you are only allowing ‘Roski’ students in this class?” I wrote back in an email. “I’m not understanding why a willing student paying for their designed education wouldn’t be allowed to take this course.”
Strike three was when they came back with a new reason for not letting me enroll: The class was at capacity, to which I sent a screengrab of the eight open spots listed on Web Registration to the department head.
They let me in after that, but it shouldn’t have been that hard. And still, no one told me why only Roski students were welcome to enroll in the class.
I have colleagues who’ve also experienced their own form of chauvinism through USC’s art schools. Everything from not affording roles to outside majors in school performances through the School of Dramatic Arts to Thornton School of Music professors boasting a sarcastic, if not outright rude, demeanor to students from different degrees enrolled in their courses.
We’re not the first students who have been “othered” by USC’s art schools, and we won’t be the last, not if these departments maintain an elitist attitude that perceives non-majors as lesser artists and outsiders who don’t belong in the art classroom. Not only does this send the message that “non-artists” aren’t welcome in the community, but that they’re not even welcome to learn how to be a part of the community.
This sort of separatism starts in academia, but it can also end there. 
The arts are a discipline that has long faced judgment and harsh critiques from outsiders who view the creative practice as gratuitous, but oftentimes people turn away from a subject due to a lack of understanding. This cycle is perpetuated when artists who are on the inside turn their noses up at the ones who don’t understand instead of finding ways to reach out and meet them where they’re at. And the ones at fault for perpetuating this dynamic are institutions like USC.
Art industries are facing monumental issues in equity and accessibility — an issue that deserves an article of its own — but conversations of elitism and accessibility aside, USC students pay upwards of $40,000 a semester to attend on a full-time schedule. The least the school could do is allow us to pay for classes we want to take.

A scratch soccer game between a group of USC students and visitors escalated into physical assaults and battery at Brittingham Intramural Field on Aug. 30, resulting in the Los Angeles Police Department detaining a student who was later hospitalized.
Tony Yuan, an international graduate student studying applied economics and econometrics, was beaten by multiple visitors on the soccer field after he allegedly touched the groin area of Jaime Iniguez, identified in the DPS report as the primary suspect in the incident — which caused serious bleeding on his face.
“He and his friends [started] beating me … Someone just held my hair and punched my face, and someone kicked my leg. I must do some self-defense, so I fought someone [as well],” Yuan said.
There were more than 12 people who witnessed the incident at the Brittingham Field, some of whom helped de-escalate the violence and called USC’s Department of Public Safety for help immediately.
“When they threw a bottle and the fight began, a lot of us were shocked and even [had] no reactions. Only me and several friends came to help Tony. I mean, not to fight but grab them out of the fight,” said Peiheng Huang, a graduate student studying applied economics and econometrics who witnessed the incident.
David Carlisle, the interim chief of DPS, confirmed with the Daily Trojan that DPS officers arrived at the scene after receiving the report. LAPD officers then detained Yuan and Iniguez at the Southwest Community Police Station. Later, both parties were released, and Yuan went to the LAC+USC Medical Center to receive treatment for his injuries sustained during the fight.
After the incident, Jeffrey Wang, a senior majoring in math, who has more than 15,800 followers on Instagram, posted the video of the incident on his account. The video accumulated 40,000 views, before the platform took down the video for unknown reasons.
“I usually play with these guys regularly… we are super familiar with each other,” Wang said. “Because I have more influence than others on Instagram, I think I am the best one to send the videos out to make more influence on the matter.”
The spread of the videos online also gathered attention of who may be related to the visitors involved in the altercation. 
According to Wang, an anonymous account messaged him on Instagram with racial slurs, and threatened to “send [his] friends on [Wang’s] page.”
Instagram took down the video clips uploaded onto Wang’s account the next day, and Wang suspects that it may be because of the graphic content of the video and people leaving aggressive comments.
Carlisle said that DPS completed the investigation of the incident and sent a report to LAPD. At the time of the report, neither Yuan nor Iniguez wanted to place the other one under arrest, and the city attorney will review all of the facts to determine if he needs more information or to file charges.
However, Yuan and others said they were disappointed by the University’s reaction, and that DPS should better protect students’ interest and safety, as similar incidents have occured on campus multiple times.
“The school still did not give me any explanation for that,” Yuan said. “Because this is not the first time [that students are] having conflict [with non-USC visitors]. So, we just want to have more focus [on the issue] to force USC and DPS to come up with better policies to improve the safety on campus.”
Students also blamed the school’s reaction for making them afraid of playing soccer on campus.
“I refuse to go [to Brittingham]. Even though I am just a witness… I still get a lot of shocks because the school did not [have] any reactions,” said Huang.
Carlisle also said the incident has been reported to USC Student Affairs, where officials will discuss whether visitors should be using the recreational facilities on campus, in hope to limit these kinds of conflicts in the future.
“There have been discussions about limiting the use of the field, that [decision] will be made by senior leaders of the University,” Carlisle said. “But no final decisions have been made.”

Today marks the start of Latinx Heritage Month. Latinx culture is filled with rich artistry and creativity that deserves to be recognized this month and every day of the year, but here’s a list of films, television series, music and more to watch and listen to in acknowledgment of Latinx creatives.
“Real Women Have Curves” (2002) 
Patricia Cardoso’s movie, “Real Women Have Curves,” will hit you like a truck. Following the relationship of mother and daughter Carmen (Lupe Ontiveros) and Ana Garica (America Ferrera), the movie deals with the disconnect often found between immigrant parents and their children. “Real Women Have Curves” is a special type of coming-of-age story that deals with class, body image and race.  The film manages to be simultaneously hilarious and gut-wrenchingly devastating. Available to stream on  HBO Max, “Real Women Have Curves is the perfect opportunity to make use of your complimentary subscription and watch this cultural classic.  
“Los Espookys”
Starring “Saturday Night Live” alums Fred Armisen and Julio Torres, “Los Espookys” may be the most underrated comedy show on television right now. (Also, honorable article mention to Torres’ stand-up special “My Favorite Shapes.” If you need to cry laughing, this is the special to watch).
 “Los Espookys” is quirky, to say the least. Four friends work together to stage horror scenes for events that really should not include horror — such as a quinceañera. Torres managed to create a show with the bizarre energy television has been missing recently. Season two of “Los Espookys” will be released on HBO Max September 16.  
 “One Day at a Time”
Following the story of a three-generation Cuban family living in the United States, “One Day at a Time” is an immaculate feel-good family sitcom that can lift your spirits even on your toughest days. Starring Latina icon Rita Moreno, the show had a four-season run before unfortunately getting canceled. Still, the sitcom provided important representation in showing a loving Latinx family dynamic. Even with the uplifting energy, the show did not shy away from discussing controversial topics Latinx people in America face such as racism and xenophobia. 
“Un Verano Sin Ti” by Bad Bunny
Labeled by The Guardian as “the world’s biggest pop star,” Bad Bunny has taken over the world. His latest album, “Un Verano Sin Ti” proves that title is well-deserved. The Puerto Rican artist’s album is a wonderful way to start your journey into the world of reggaetón. With “Un Verano Sin Ti,” Bad Bunny is effectively bringing Caribbean culture into the mainstream. Bad Bunny’s public groundbreaking rejection of gender norms combined with his traditional reggaetón sounds results in an album that feels simultaneously modern and nostalgic.
“Amor Prohibido” by Selena
To write an article highlighting Latinx art, and not include Selena would be a crime. Largely considered to be her best album by critics and fans alike, “Amor Prohibido” is a staple of modern Tejano music. It was the first Tejano-led album to enter the Billboard Top 200 charts and remains the best-selling Tejano album of all time — and rightfully so. Whether you need to cry to “No Me Queda Más” or dance around your room to “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,” Selena and “Amor Prohibido” will always be there for you.   
“Mexican Gothic” by Silvia Moreno-Garcia
If you are a fan of classic gothic novels like Charlotte Brontë’s “Jane Eyre” and Emily Brontë’s “Wuthering Heights,” do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of “Mexican Gothic.” Moreno-Garica, being of Mexican descent, centers the stories around popular Mexican folklore and mythology. A beautiful spin on the classic fantasy horror genre, Noemí, the feminist protagonist of the novel, finds herself in a haunted mansion and must find her way out. However, the book is so much more than just a great story: it provides important representation of the dangerous long-lasting effects of the colonization of Latin America.
“I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” by Erika L. Sánchez
Finalist for the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature, “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” is a story about grief, love and family. After the death of her sister, Julia is forced to find her place in the world while also trying to satisfy the expectations of her immigrant Mexican parents. “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” is an important read to understand the cultural struggles felt by many children of immigrants.

Alex Aster first introduced her fantasy novel “Lightlark” to TikTok in March of 2021. She promised a novel similar to “The Hunger Games” and “A Court of Thorns and Roses” but with a more diverse cast. Aster and “Lightlark” quickly went viral on “Booktok” — a sect of TikTok where users discuss and set book trends — as readers were excited to finally see a Latina author in the spotlight of the fantasy genre. 
Within a week of her newfound internet fame, Aster’s book went to auction, and she was offered a six-figure deal with Amulet Books. 
Aster continued to advertise her novel on TikTok leading up to its release on August 23. Videos filled with quotes from the novel, and promises of classic young adult literary tropes such as rivals to lovers, a love triangle and the villain gets the girl, filled her TikTok profile.  
Aster’s positive public image began to crumble after advance reader copies  of the novel were released in mid-August. As popular creators began to review their advanced copies of “Lightlark,” people quickly came to realize the book was completely different from what Aster advertised on social media.
Notably, some of the most popular quotes and situations promised on her TikTok account were absent from the novel. The mature love triangle Aster promised was met with lukewarm reactions by ARC readers. She also teased a scene where her main character is regaining consciousness during a battle while the villain is attacking those who harmed her, a popular scenario in enemies-to-lovers novels. According to ARC readers, this scene was nowhere to be found in the book. By inaccurately advertising “Lightlark,” Aster garnered pre-orders with misrepresentative material. 
Even worse, following Aster’s promises of diversity, fans were disappointed with the representation in the novel.
One fan took to TikTok to complain. “There was no diversity or representation. There was only one Black ruler and he was [gay]. It was giving tokenism. Go girl! Give us NOTHING,” user @bookish.puertorican posted.  
After Aster received a movie deal with Universal Pictures while the novel was still in the pre-order stage, fans began suspecting that her miraculous rise to fame maybe wasn’t so miraculous after all.
In addition to misrepresenting the novel, Aster shared the years of failure and hard work over the last decade she weathered to frame her publishing journey as inspirational. Her online presence was carefully crafted to make it appear as though “Lightlark” was her first big break into publishing.
However, this wasn’t the case. Her middle-grade novel, the “Curse of the Night Witch,” was released in mid-2020. Aster promoted the “Curse of the Night Witch” with the same publishing difficulties narrative she pushed with “Lightlark.” But as soon as she began promoting “Lightlark,” Aster conspicuously stopped talking about “Curse of the Night Witch” completely. 
After coming under fire for this inconsistency, Aster made it clear that “Curse of the Night Witch” was published under a “small book deal,” and that she didn’t make much from it. While “Curse of the Night Witch” currently has a 3.87 star on Goodreads, higher than “Lightlark’s” 3.19 star rating, it was commercially less successful.
Although information on Aster’s history is available to the general public, it is unlikely that the average TikTok user is spending time researching her. Consequently, Aster was able to successfully advertise herself as an underdog. 
But Aster is anything but. She denies using her parents’ fortune to help her career, but people suspect that Aster’s parents still came to her aid — the Times Square billboard costing five figures certainly didn’t help her case. 
After the controversy, individuals began review bombing Aster’s Goodreads profile. “Lightlark” went from five stars to a harsh two in just a few days. 
Aster quickly came to her own defense and claimed that everything she advertised would be in the final copy of the book, just not verbatim. She admitted to her privileges but denied using them to aid her publishing journey. Followers were not completely satisfied with the response, but somehow “Lightlark” still debuted at #1 on the New York Times Bestseller List — which is likely a result of the massive number of people who pre-ordered the novel under false pretenses.
Criticism about Aster’s marketing strategies continue, especially now that followers are scrutinizing her under a more rigid lens. User @the.page.sage made a video alleging Aster was taking part of scarcity marketing, and disproving Aster’s claims to have sold out by sharing a screenshot of its availability for order on the Barnes & Noble website. 
 People are accusing her of providing a low supply of her novel, so it could sell out with fewer purchases to make her appear more in demand than she is.
Aster attempted to market her book so widely that she almost forgot “Lightlark” is a young adult novel. She acquired massive amounts of pre-orders at the expense of age-appropriate readers and positive reviews.
Alex Aster’s journey is a cautionary tale. It shows the power that social media has over public opinion and how influential this opinion is in creative industries. The public may never know if Aster had family ties to her publishing house or a personal connection with Universal Pictures. 
However, it is undeniable that Aster would never have achieved her level of success without TikTok. As social media becomes the top marketing platform, the relationship between fan and author has never been more vital in the publishing industry. Thanks to the algorithm and her sometimes tacky techniques, she succeeded in reaching the largest audience possible. 
Now, for the first time ever, we have a clickbait novel.

As of June 2022, the USC Gould School of Law is now offering its first undergraduate degree — the bachelor of science in legal studies.
The new major, geared towards giving students an extensive breadth of knowledge about the United States legal system, is a 48-unit major that blends law, society, historical precedent and legal reasoning in the U.S. court system. Required courses for the major cover a broad range of topics, ranging from criminal justice to cybersecurity, and pair alongside a required law internship and capstone project.
An additional component of the legal studies major is the four tracks students must choose from for their upper division courses — regulatory state, public law, private law and general legal studies. 
Both the regulatory state and public law tracks carry many governmental law courses that dive into areas like administrative agency activity or landmark Supreme Court decisions, aimed at giving those students an understanding of how the government regulates society. Private law courses will answer questions of how transactions are regulated between individuals, including the workings of contracts and corporations. And if students are looking to touch on all three specialties and gain a more wide-spanning legal perspective, there is a general legal studies track just for them.
“We heard that what students really like to do is to be able to tailor the degree to themselves but have some guidance,’’ said Professor Bob Rasmussen, a professor of law and political science. “[So we] put together three broad categories, plus a catch-all, to give people some sense if they want to specialize.”
The decision to create the bachelor’s degree was a natural next step in the law school’s long participation in undergraduate education over the last 30 years, according to Rasmussen.
“We partnered with the folks in philosophy to start the philosophy, politics and law major,” Rasmussen said. “Then we partnered with the folks over in the humanities to start the law, history and culture major … [and started] a lot of law-related minors in the college. So it’s kind of been growing organically.” 
Students taking their first steps into their new bachelor’s degree have shown excitement and optimism about the courses. Clarissa Rosales, a sophomore now majoring in legal studies, plans to specialize in immigration law and assist undocumented immigrants in the Southern California area.
“Even just the three classes that I’ve taken [have] definitely given me a good foundation and some basic knowledge that’s definitely increasing my confidence for when I do go to law school,” Rosales said.
The addition of the new Gould bachelor’s also made some students’ academic plans at USC clearer. Sophomore Madi Ingrassia is now double majoring in music industry and legal studies after a long journey to find her desired majors and minors and switching between several combinations across many disciplines to best prepare herself for a career in entertainment law.
“I’ve been pre-law since I was admitted to USC. But I always wanted to add an extra little something interdisciplinary to bump up my education and take advantage of my time here,” Ingrassia said. “Then I found out about the legal studies major and immediately went, ‘This is it. This is what I was looking for.’”
According to Rasmussen, the new Gould degree was tailored for students to gain an appreciation of how law and society affect one another, and can be a valuable area of study regardless of if a student wishes to pursue law school or not.
“Everyone who graduates from USC is going to be a leader in something — whatever that something is, law is going to affect that,” said Rasmussen. “If they have a nuanced appreciation for how law affects things, they can use [the major] to their advantage to be more successful in their careers and maybe help guide us to a more just and equitable society.”

When I first heard the news about USC moving to the Big Ten, I was initially conflicted. On one hand, I understood that this move allows USC to play in more primetime, competitive games while also gaining more money for the school through media rights deals. However, at the same time, I realized that USC would not be playing any West Coast schools regularly aside from UCLA.
Although I am graduating this year and this move will not take place until 2024, it worries me that future Trojans that they won’t get to witness other fierce rivalries we have had with schools such as  Stanford University and UC Berkeley. The spark of late-night Pac 12 and West Coast football will slowly go away now with USC’s departure.
This is not exclusive to USC. Last year, University of Texas and University of Oklahoma announced that they will be moving to the NCAA Southeastern Conference in 2025. With this change, they will lose competitors such as  Oklahoma State University, Baylor University, Texas Tech University and more with whom they had long relationships for decades. 
Larger media rights deals have been the primary cause for these decisions. In August, the Big Ten announced a deal with various platforms worth over seven billion dollars for seven  years. This nets around $60 million to $75 million per year for each of its 16 schools after USC and UCLA join. By getting deals from FOX, CBS and NBC, the Big Ten is ensuring that all their members are set financially despite the challenges that might arise from all the travel and logistics now with a greater geographical presence. 
Specifically, in the deal, the three networks are paying different amounts based on what time slots they can show. For instance, CBS and NBC are paying nearly $350 million each for games. In return, CBS will broadcast the 3:30 pm ET game while NBC gets the primetime evening Big Ten matchup. Furthermore, CBS will host the 2024 and 2028 Big Ten Championship games and NBC will have the 2026 championship. 
As you can see, these deals are somewhat convoluted, but they maximize the profits that the conference will receive. 
In all this discussion about money, there have been serious concerns from the media and public about all the changes that come with realignment. 
“My god, if this actually happens it means my chances of getting a bar in Los Angeles to put the TV on Big Ten Network will go from 0% to 0.1%,” sports blogger Mark Titus tweeted about the USC/UCLA move. 
“This of course impacts Bill Walton in ways I cannot even imagine. Big Ten, conference of champions?” sports commentator Kevin Kugler said of the realignment.
Finally, sports podcaster Ryen Russillo simply said, “All of this sucks.”
I do want to make the point though that all of these comments are not coming from current students at USC/UCLA or Big Ten schools.
From my interactions with most USC/UCLA students, they have been ambivalent or indifferent about the move. However, what is lacking is perspectives from current Big Ten students, so I went ahead and found out.
I talked with Ben Caterine, a senior at Northwestern University who is involved with Northwestern’s Sports Analytics Group, about how he felt regarding these recent changes. 
“We have a nice private school rivalry with USC hopefully, but I feel like as far as the whole cultural thing, it is definitely going to feel really weird having two random schools out in L.A.,” Caterine said. “It would kind of make more sense if the Big Ten just kind of merged with another conference… and there would be a sort of a Midwest portion and a West Coast portion.”
The Big Ten and Pac-12 have a storied rivalry played out each year through the Rose Bowl, but there are few strong rivalries between teams from each conference. 
“You have the Big Ten and Pac-12 playing in the Rose Bowl, so some of these teams have faced each other, but I guess there are not a lot of existing traditional rivalries there,” Caterine said. “It seems like over time, some could maybe sort of form. Especially like basketball, there could be some good opportunities too, like you have UCLA and Indiana [University], [which] would be like two storied basketball programs.”
Even though there is a prospect of former rivals such as Stanford joining the Big Ten as well, no official announcements have been made. So, for right now, it unfortunately appears as if the two L.A. schools will need to form new rivalries and cultures in their new conference to get students and fans excited.

After competing at the Bluejay Invitational and splitting matches with the University of Hawai’i over the last two weeks, the women’s volleyball team will return home to compete in the Trojan Challenge this weekend. USC will face New Mexico State University, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and San Jose State University beginning Thursday. 
The Trojans previously set out to Omaha, Nebraska to compete in the Bluejay Invitational hosted by Creighton University. After defeating University of Northern Iowa, the team struggled against No. 17 Creighton and No. 16 University of Kentucky, losing both matches. The team felt defeated after ending the tournament with a 1-2 record. 
“We did not feel great after that last match,” said sophomore setter Mia Tuaniga. “[We] lost focus during that second match and, after being in this group for two to three months, we want to blend in [and have good] work ethic throughout the whole match, whether it’s physical or mental”. 
In hopes of regaining momentum and avoiding a losing streak, the volleyball team traveled to Honolulu to face Hawai’i on back-to-back nights. Reminiscent of their start to the Bluejay Invitational, the Trojans won 3-1 the first night.
However, the Trojans lost a close 2-3 match against Hawaii the next night. After the loss, the team emphasized that they are still trying to find their blend as a team. 
“Our main goal right now is trying to find our team identity,” said senior outside hitter Skylar Fields. “We have 11 new people on our team — seven freshmen and four transfers — so we’re just trying to figure out how to gel with one another.” 
Although there have been highs and lows early in the season, the team’s central goal is to work better together. 
“Our shorter term goal is trying to get better with each other every day in practice,” Tuaniga said. “One of the biggest things we’ve learned from those two matches altogether is consistency. Consistency, whether it’s defense or offense, but also in our mentality.” 
With 11 new members and players missing time due to injuries, the team has not yet had a chance to play at full strength. 
“We got 11 new players out of 16, and two of the original are still hurt, so really 11 out of 14 players are brand new to the program” said head coach Brad Keller. 
According to Fields, for the team to be great, it really is about trying to find that mold to be consistent. 
“We’re still trying to gel,” Fields said, hoping that once that gel comes together, it’ll be easier “to win matches.” 
The team has been exceptional in their efforts to bond with one another. Coach Keller said that the team went on a  retreat and spent a lot of time enjoying each other’s company. 
“[It is] really important down the road, especially as we acclimate and get used to each other. Teams that become great — it takes time,” Keller said. “The faster we can get them on the same page, the better off it’s going to be and the quicker it’s going to be.”
Now returning home to host the Trojan Challenge, the team looks to be consistent throughout the entire game and to have a winning mentality. 
The women’s volleyball program has been proven to start off strong in the first set but has allowed other teams to catch up and take the lead.
The volleyball team faces New Mexico State at the Galen Center Thursday at 7 p.m.

Ranked No. 12 in the Women’s Golf Coaches Association preseason poll, only behind fellow Pac-12 teams Stanford University (No. 1), University of Oregon (No. 3), UCLA (No. 5) and Arizona State University (No. 7), the USC women’s golf team fell short in its opening tournament of the 2022-2023 season at the Branch Law Firm/Dick McGuire Invitational at the University of New Mexico Golf Course in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Trojans climbed all the way up to a tie at 2-over par for fifth place through 10 holes in the second round, but ended up shooting 17 strokes over par with a total score of 881 and an eighth place finish.
Unranked Ohio State University outlasted the field of teams by a whopping 10 strokes shooting 11-under par at 853 (283, 283, 287). The Buckeyes were fueled by the trio of senior Lauren Peter, senior Aneka Seumanutafa and redshirt junior Caley McGinty — shooting a combined 7-under par throughout the three rounds. 
Fifth-year head coach Justin Silverstein, an assistant coach for the 2013 NCAA champion USC women’s golf team and 2019 Pac-12 co-coach of the year, was critical of the team’s play this past weekend.
“It was a disappointing effort, top to bottom really; we had a couple bright spots, but it was unfortunately overshadowed by more poor play,” said Silverstein in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
However, Silverstein is not worried about the team’s performance, as the squad is looking to capitalize on its own mistakes.
“We’ve got a great group, very young and talented,” Silverstein said. “This is just kind of a bump in the road, but I think at the end of the year we’ll look at this as just an aberration and not necessarily the norm.”
Sophomore Xin (Cindy) Kou led the way for the Trojans, tying for 17th place in the individual portion of the event and totaling a score of 2-over par for the tournament. Kou started the first two rounds very strong, shooting even par, but dipped to 2 shots over for the third and final round. 
“Cindy has been working really, really hard this summer,” Silverstein said. “As a coach, I always appreciate people who come in with their game tidy, just looks good, like they put in the time and the effort to do all the little things well.”
Sophomore Amari Avery, one of eight golfers from the Pac-12 on the 2022-23 Preseason ANNIKA Award Watch List, tied for 23rd place at 3 strokes over par 219(72-71-76). After performing well throughout the first day, finishing with a respectable score of -1 after 36 holes, her performance dipped on the final 18 holes, totaling  +3 in the finale. 
“We’re expecting her to be in the player of the year race come Pac-12 regionals and nationals,” Silverstein said. “Her expectation is to win that award, my expectation of her is to win that award, you know that’s the neighborhood she lives in her golf game. This performance this week was not indicative of where her game is at; her game looks good.”
Avery was named a 2022 First Team All-American as a freshman last year and sits at No. 6 in the World Amateur Golf Rankings. 
Freshman Catherine Park made her debut as a Trojan, shooting par in her final round of the tournament. Like Avery, she ended up tied for 23rd place shooting 3-over 219 (74, 73, 72). 
Park was the eighth-ranked senior in her high school class in the Golfweek Magazine rankings and played at the 2022 U.S. Women’s Open.
Coach Silverstein highlighted the Trojans prowess when it came to putting.
“I actually do think we did a nice job on the greens. I think we putted better than we have at home,” Silverstein said. “Our speed control on the greens is getting better and that is something that tends to get better with more time spent … If we can get as good as I think we can in that area, we’re going to be able to compete with anybody in the country.”
USC will travel to Chicago for the Windy City Classic beginning Oct. 3. Last season, the Trojans finished in second-to-last place in the tournament. 
“This group is aware of what happened last year, and they don’t need any extra fuel,” Silverstein said. “If we need extra motivation to get to the golf course, we’re in bigger trouble in this sport.”

They strut the streets of campus in their ribbed muscle tanks accompanied by their infamous protein shakes. They dominate the dining halls, scouting out the plethora of protein to measure their meal to the precise macros. They live in the gym and can almost always be spotted blasting Kanye by the bench rack. If you’re lucky, you might even witness their somewhat discreet selfies where they flex their abs to their followers. They are elusive and they are everywhere. They are the infamous “gym bro.” 
The typical gym bro’s holy temple is in the gym — prioritizing their exercise and fitness with the aspiration to achieve a lean and muscular physique, but their efforts extend beyond their time spent lifting weights. Their dedication to their “dream body” is ubiquitous, and for the most part, unattainable.
But we often praise the aesthetic of the gym bro. They are worshiped around campus. The treadmills idolize them. We commend their resilience and strength to restrict. They are intimidating, tough, and unbreakable. They thrive. 
But they’re deprived. 
While it is essential to prioritize your physical health, these fabled gym bros fail to recognize their mental health. Bigorexia is a mental health disorder that triggers a fixation on the size of your body, primarily in teen men. This forms muscle dysmorphia and can ultimately instigate the development of eating disorders. 
Disordered eating patterns are often overlooked in men — especially those who seem to be the image of health as they hit the gym on a schedule more consistent than that of my sleep. Whether it is cutting calories to restrict food intake and appear leaner, or bulking by adding protein to gain more muscle, the restriction surrounding food appears to be extreme when looking at “gym bro” culture.
There is an ongoing misconception within society that eating disorders only affect women. According to the National Eating Disorders Association, one in three people with an eating disorder is male. The association also found that subclinical eating disorder behaviors do not differ between men and women, but a willingness to seek treatment does. This reinstates stigmatized and gendered perception of these serious illnesses. They are normalized in today’s culture and leave victims unwilling to seek help. 
The rise of social media only amplifies the spread of toxic gym culture. Inspirational fitness accounts perpetuate the unrealistic body and often provide false information on obtaining a healthy lifestyle. It bestows new insecurities and obsessions through fitness challenges and body checks. 
Students should not have to walk into the dining hall after class and read the labels of each calorie at the pasta bar. Students should not have to read the pinned poster on the vending machine that reads “CALORIES COUNT: CHECK THEN CHOOSE” when leaving their dorm in the morning. Students should not be working out in fear of gaining the “freshman 15.” We live in a weight-obsessed society that fails to recognize the hardships of diet culture. We need to do a better job of listening to our peers, of educating students about the dangers of these serious disorders and of catching early behaviors and providing helpful resources. Unrealistic body image issues persist in our society, and while we all know them by their dignity and strength, some of our bros are suffering in silence.
