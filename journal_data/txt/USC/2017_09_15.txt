Stephen Carr | Daily Trojan
Standing at 6 feet and weighing 210 pounds, running back Stephen Carr sure doesn’t look like a freshman. 
As we’ve learned the past two weeks, he doesn’t play like one either. A four-star recruit from Summit High School in Fontana, Calif., Carr turned heads in his first two games in a USC uniform. Carr ran for 188 yards on 18 carries while also picking up 41 yards in the receiving game. 
“Explosiveness”: That’s the word that comes to head coach Clay Helton’s mind when talking about the freshman running back. When the Trojans held a narrow 35-31 lead over Western Michigan with three minutes to go in the game, USC was looking to move the chains and eat up some time. Carr had other plans, breaking off a 52-yard run that all but ended the game. Carr’s big play ability has been evident, with a 52-yard run in each of the first two games. 
“Every time he touches the ball, you kind of hold your breath,” Helton said.
The transition from high school football to the college game is substantial. Many recruits get lost once they’re forced to learn more concepts and fundamentals. To Carr, the biggest change has been in the speed of the game and the Xs and Os. 
“It’s much faster up here and you have to make sure you’re on your stuff every play,” Carr said. “It’s not like high school where, because you’re an elite athlete, you get that little room to relax a little bit. Up here, you have to be on every snap.”
After arriving on campus, Carr has put in the work, and offensive coordinator Tee Martin believes it’s paying off. Helped by teammates such as junior running back Ronald Jones II, Carr has quickly caught up to the NCAA level of competitive edge. It was a surprise to Martin and the other coaches to see a young player adapt so quickly, but once Carr showed his promise in practice, the coaching staff felt comfortable trusting him in game situations.
“He’s doing a real good job as a true freshman to understand our protections, run schemes, footwork and eyes,” Martin said. “It wasn’t a surprise with how he’s playing in games because he’s been doing it consistently in practice.”
Carr has made the most of the reps he’s gotten in practice. He bought into the program’s intensity immediately, a mentality that Carr believes is part of the reason he’s been able to contribute so early. The Trojans emphasize attacking at full speed on every play, and that pressure to finish plays and push at a high pace prepared Carr in the offseason to perform at his current level.
As other highly touted recruits around the country are working hard to see the field, Carr is already looking like an integral part of USC’s offense. His ability to push through tackles — a theme for this year’s backfield — has paid off as well.
“I think some people think of him as kind of a scat back, but when they get up on him and try to hit him they’re bouncing off him,” Martin said. “When you look at his yards after contact, they’re right up there with the best. He’s a complete back.”
As far as what Carr’s ceiling is, it’s too early to say. But despite his talent, running backs coach Deland McCullough thinks it is important to keep young athletes levelheaded as their star begins to rise. 
“He’s pretty doggone good,” McCullough said. “But again, I continue to keep them grounded. I’ve told them ‘I’ve coached guys who have sat in your same seat, I sat in your seat, and we’ve had some success playing the game.’ But as soon as you start hearing how good you are and all these different things like that, you could be setting yourself up for failure.”
Carr has had a best-case-scenario start to the 2017 season, but the Trojans have only played two games, and there’s much more work to do. Helton hopes to see him grow in his ability to protect the pass. McCullough wants to build both his confidence and his calmness in big-game situations. But both coaches have one way to describe Carr’s talent: special. 
For the rest of the season, Carr’s goals are simple: to make the most of every opportunity. He’s made a splash in his first two weeks, but the work is only getting started for No. 7.

Tyler Kowta | Daily Trojan
With new head coach Patrick Henner at the helm, the women’s cross country team will look to build toward future success in the 2017 season.
The Trojans opened their season on Sept. 1 at the Pepperdine Invitational, placing fourth out of six teams. Junior captain Amber Gore led the team with a 14:48.61 second-place finish. Senior Madison Ricks and junior Lauren Maurer also finished inside the top 20 with times of 15:53.05 and 15:59.84, respectively.
“I’m super excited to start the year on a [personal record], especially on such an unusual course,” Gore said. “It’s 4k, while usually we’ll run 5k or 6k, so it was really a confidence booster going into our first real season meet.”
Henner said the current focus of the team is learning race tactics, rather than hitting a particular time.
“All these early meets, we’re really using those as tools to get better to really learn how to execute and how to run the race,” Henner said. “We’ve just been working on overall general fitness, we’re just going to try to keep seeing how that fitness is going to help us execute better and finish stronger.”
For Saturday’s UC Riverside Invitational, the strategy will be the same as at Pepperdine: run comfortable early and hard late.
“One of the key concepts we’re working on is building intensity,” Henner said. “So, starting relaxed mentally and physically and then trying each k[ilometer] or each mile to build, build, build so that we’re racing really hard at the end.”
As the cross country season extends through November, Henner plans to train through the beginning of the season, allowing the team to peak at late-season meets like the Pac-12 championships.
The conference includes a dominant Oregon women’s program that swept the cross country, indoor track and outdoor track NCAA team titles in the 2016-2017 season. Colorado and Stanford, also Pac-12 teams, took third and fifth in the 2016 NCAA Cross Country Championships. 
With a 12th-place finish at the meet in 2016, USC only has space to improve.
“We’re taking a really long-term approach,” Henner said. “We want to of course get a lot better as we progress through the season and get towards the end with the Pac-12 and so forth, but we’re also trying to set ourselves well for track season, indoor and outdoor track season, and even, you know, looking down the road a year from now.”
Having a new coach enter a program can be a transition, but Henner has been pleased with the team’s personality thus far. 
“It’s been good,” Henner said. “I think it’s getting better and better too, because they kind of have to adapt to a new coach, a new training system, and I have to adapt to the athletes. So instead of just trying to rush in, I’ve really been trying to learn about the athletes, what they’ve done for training, how do they respond to the training.”
Looking forward, both Henner and Gore believe these team dynamics will help elevate the long-term success of the program. 
“I think we have a really good group of girls this year and I’m excited for us all to kind of just mesh and click as one unit and see what we can do on the conference level,” Gore said. 
“Definitely, [we’re] one big melting pot. We have all different types of personalities and I think every person brings out a strength in another person and we use each other to make everyone better every day in practice and at meets, too.”

It’s been more than a decade in the making, and it’s finally here. For the first time since Vince Young broke Trojan hearts in 2006, USC will face Texas. All 93,607 seats in the Coliseum have been sold, and this weekend’s primetime game has even caught the attention of celebrities like Lance Armstrong.
But instead of talking about USC’s championship aspirations or Texas’ attempted recovery under new head coach Tom Herman, all the discussion leading up to Saturday’s tilt has been centered on the infamous 2006 Rose Bowl game. In fact, the biggest story so far is probably the fact that USC vacated its 2006 loss to Texas due to NCAA sanctions. Some in the media tried to frame the Trojans as sore losers who tried to erase embarrassing history, and outspoken Longhorn fan Armstrong slammed USC in an expletive-filled tweet.
“Negative @USC, we were there. You lost the game fair and square,” Armstrong said. “Btw, @ReggieBush is a f—ing legend that you s— all over.”
Forget the laughable fact that Lance Armstrong of all people said this — it’s not like his seven (stripped) Tour de France titles were “fair and square.” Forget the fact that USC actually vacated the loss on the orders of the NCAA. What’s most shocking is that this non-story gained so much traction in the first place. And that’s because there’s really nothing to discuss about Saturday’s game other than the 11-year-old shadow hanging over it.
It wasn’t supposed to be this way: The Trojans opened the year ranked No. 4 in the AP poll, and the Longhorns were No. 23. Had both teams entered this week undefeated, it would have set the stage for a titanic clash of college football bluebloods with wind in their sails. Alas, Texas couldn’t hold up its end of the bargain, losing 51-41 to Maryland at home on opening day. Now, the Longhorns are all but out of the national discussion, and Vegas favors the Trojans by more than two touchdowns in Saturday’s game.
Nevertheless, I’m sure everyone in Los Angeles is sick of re-living 2006’s heartbreak — so let’s actually break down this weekend’s matchup. Despite bookies pegging this as a mismatch, the point spread may be too high considering Texas rebounded from its Week 1 loss by annihilating San Jose State 56-0 last Saturday.
But even with some momentum heading into the weekend, Texas will have to contain USC’s offense after giving up more than 30 points in eight of its 12 games last year. The team is also dealing with question marks at quarterback: sophomore Shane Buechele started against Maryland, but a shoulder injury thrust true freshman Sam Ehlinger into the spotlight a week later against the Spartans. With so little else going for them right now, the last thing the Longhorns need is uncertainty under center, but they will be relieved to see junior linebacker Porter Gustin listed as doubtful for USC, meaning one of the Trojans’ most dangerous pass rushers will be eliminated — or at the very least limited.
Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
Gustin’s injury undoubtedly comes as a blow for head coach Clay Helton, and it feeds into the biggest concern for USC this week: the injury bug. Redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe, who was one of the team’s biggest red-zone threats last season, has been shut down indefinitely with a lower-body injury. Freshman defensive tackle Marlon Tuipulotu has been ruled out after he sprained his knee against Stanford in his first career start, and sophomore wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. still hasn’t seen the field this year thanks to an ankle issue. The Trojans probably feel good about their chances on Saturday regardless, but depth isn’t this squad’s strength. With no bye week this season, it’s a little concerning to see wear and tear taking its toll on the roster this early in the campaign.
The last thing USC can afford to do, however, is tread lightly on Saturday. Putting too much focus on staying healthy for the long run could cause the season to implode in the near future. At the same time, the Trojans can ill-afford more injuries with back-to-back road games coming up — one of them on a short week. The difficulty of striking this balance is what might make this a trap game: It isn’t easy to play (or coach) with one eye on next week, but the Trojans may have to do so.
I know it’s not the most compelling storyline for a sold-out primetime game. I suppose it makes sense, then, that everyone is still talking about 2006; even as a Trojan fan, it might be more compelling to argue about LenDale White’s fourth-down run or Reggie Bush’s bizarre lateral attempt than to discuss the Longhorns’ quarterback predicament or Gustin’s status for game day. But after USC snapped its three-game losing streak to Stanford last weekend, Saturday brings a chance to exorcise more demons. 
Though the Coliseum won’t quite feel like Pasadena did 11 years ago, the sellout crowd will give the contest a bowl-game feel. It’ll be a rollicking atmosphere, and perhaps the Trojans are raring to exact their revenge.
Remember, though, that Texas robbed a national championship from USC. The best revenge won’t come this weekend, but rather through surviving and advancing. Then it’s on to Cal — and down the line, hopefully Atlanta.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Since its inception 15 years ago, ABC’s The Bachelor — a reality show in which 25 women compete for a chance at marital bliss with a charming bachelor — has arguably become the biggest reality TV show in the nation. Its spinoff series, The Bachelorette, has earned similar success, and the castoffs never leave empty-handed. 
Female contestants who stay on the show long enough can become social media influencers and utilize their Instagram feeds to sell dieters’ tea, among other unorthodox products; almost all castoffs who make it past the third episode have a good chance at being invited to Bachelor in Paradise, the franchise’s summer spinoff purportedly for young singles to find love on a Mexican beach. And contestants who wind up in The Bachelor’s top four have a good shot at being selected to be next bachelor or bachelorette.
That’s how most season leads get the gig, and most recently, that’s how Rachel Lindsay — the franchise’s first black bachelorette — got the job after coming in third in Nick Viall’s season of The Bachelor. In all but rare cases throughout the franchise’s long history, leads are cast from the previous season. 
But this wasn’t the case for the casting choice of The Bachelor’s 22nd season, which will air in January 2018. Instead, the producers went with Arie Luyendyk, Jr., a castoff from a Bachelorette season more than five years ago — a millennia in Bachelor nation time — without even so much as extending an invitation to the lone man of color in Lindsay’s top four. Frankly, were it not for my family’s decades-long, guilty-pleasure obsession with the franchise, I wouldn’t even know who Luyendyk was.
In either case, Eric Bigger, 29, an African American contestant from Baltimore, became the second runner-up after undergoing far more character growth than you’d expect of anyone in one season of a reality show. Early on, Bigger found himself unwittingly caught in petty fights with the season’s resident racist before appearing to mature — even find inner peace — from deep conversations with Lindsay about the authenticity of his intentions, and his humble upbringing. 
Lindsay’s conversations with Bigger seemed to draw the most attention and commentary from online columnists than those of any season in recent franchise history. They gave the most complex glimpse of real life outside of the artificial glamour and fabrication of “reality” television. Bigger’s youth was woven with crime and addiction within his family, and the struggle to find love and accept himself as worthy of it. 
In pushing himself to have these exceptionally difficult conversations on camera, Bigger proved himself more three-dimensional than any other candidate this season — maybe in franchise history. His full-mouthed smile, puppy-like enthusiasm and, ultimately, his tangible zest for life dominated Lindsay’s season. 
There was no reason for producers to overlook him, but according to Bigger, that’s exactly what they did. One of the most charismatic and memorable contestants in the history of the franchise was overlooked for a gray-haired, exceptionally average 36-year-old white male, whose most interesting piece of background information is that he once formerly dated a producer on the show and failed to disclose it to the then-bachelorette, Emily Maynard.
Nonetheless, Bigger hardly seems embittered about this decision by producers, thanking the show for giving him an opportunity to “become a man” and to fall in love. But regardless, the implications of this snub speak volumes about the franchise and what diversity really means to its producers, who were once so quick to pat themselves on the back for casting Lindsay as the bachelorette earlier this year — as if 15 years were a short time to wait for a first black lead. 
To them, diversity is an experiment, not a matter of representing different types of people and bringing inclusivity and authenticity to a reality show for a diverse nation. BuzzFeed reports that the ratings of Lindsay’s season, however widely it was marketed, were subpar, and speculates that Lindsay’s blackness could have been identified by producers as a reason for this.
Further, in the eyes of the show’s producers, diversity can also serve as a tool for shock factor, but only if used in moderation. To follow Lindsay with the franchise’s first black bachelor would wholly strip diversity of its shock factor. For that reason — and, likely, for that reason alone — Bigger was not even considered.
Lindsay’s casting as the first black bachelorette was important, and it certainly warranted celebration. But the franchise’s smugness and pride in its decision, as if their choice in casting Lindsay had somehow created something greater than world peace, also sent the message that diversity and blackness are a sort of rarity. It sent the message that inclusion and representation of people of color are so strenuous and forced as to be reserved only for rare, special occasions.
In casting Lindsay as the bachelorette, the show’s producers did not achieve some great feat so much as they — finally, after more than a decade and dozens of mediocre white leads — gave representation where it was due from day one. And ultimately, the producers’ decision to overlook Bigger should be just as attention-grabbing as its decision to cast Lindsay six months ago.

A newly recognized organization on campus, the Central American Network, is seeking to provide unity, academic help, personal support and, most importantly, a space for students to unapologetically be themselves. 
“Essentially, the mission statement of CAN is to empower the Central American community on- and off-campus by bringing educational resources to our people such as mentorship, tutoring and partnerships with nonprofits and fostering a Central American identity,” said Nathalye López, one of the CAN co-chairs. “We want to raise awareness and advocate for our culture.” 
Two years ago, López, a senior majoring in human biology and contemporary Latino and Latin American studies, was sitting in an Introduction to Mesoamerican lecture when the teaching assistant, Floridalma Boj-López, briefly discussed contemporary Latin American issues, emphasizing Central America. This intrigued López, and she decided to go into Boj-López’s office hours to dive into detail about her culture. After a few meetings, Boj-López urged López to start a small gathering of Central American students who also wanted to further their knowledge about their own culture. 
“She told me, if there are more of you, you should all connect because numbers are powerful,” López said. 
Boj-López also told López she was an immigrant herself and this was a topic she held dear to her heart. The group began with one other student joining López and Boj-López, then it expanded every week. Ultimately, the Central American Network was conceived. 
However, there was a long road ahead before CAN could be formally acknowledged. López and Boj-López faced many obstacles in sorting out the logistics of becoming a recognized student organization and finding a group of members to uphold the values of CAN. They had to wait an additional year to get recognized. Through it all, CAN organization persevered and is now officially recognized.
Michael Alvarez, CAN’s director of public relations, hopes that CAN will make an impact far into the future. 
“Now that we are an official organization, our goal is to maintain sustainability and growth,” Alvarez said. “We do not want this to become dormant. We want to grow within our campus and community for years to come.” 
Although there are other Latino/a-oriented organizations, CAN is the first to represent Central American students.
“We have Latinx organizations like [the Latina/o Student Assembly] and El Centro Chicano, but they focus on Mexican culture and I personally do not feel at home,” said Jennifer Gonzalez, CAN’s recruitment chair. “I know they do not intentionally mean to focus on Chicano/as, but it just so happens to be that way.” 
Members of CAN believe that the campus should encompass the diversity of countries that the Latinx community represent.  
“We want to pave the way for the inclusion of different Hispanic cultures,” Alvarez said. “Personally, I am from Puerto Rico and it would be great to have a club centered around Caribbean culture, but for now this is great — one step at a time.”
CAN’s executive board is continuing to work to bring its ideas to life. One of its goals is to create a scholarship to benefit current freshmen and the youth in South Central Los Angeles.
“This will be open to everyone regardless of race or ethnicity, but it is moreso directed towards Central Americans,” Gonzalez said. “We feel this is one way to be active and enhance access to education within our people.” 
CAN is looking forward to two upcoming events. The first is La Fiesta Centroamericana, taking place on Sept. 15, which aims to shed light on the Independence Days of four of the seven Central American countries. 
CAN is also partnering with the Central American Resource Center, Homies Unidos and South Central Scholars to host the annual Central American Youth Leadership Conference at California State University, Los Angeles. The event will feature food and educational workshops for undocumented and at-risk youth. Last year, CAN members volunteered at the event, but this year they will be responsible for the programming and execution of each workshop topic. 
“We are the first and only Central American organization at USC,” the executive board said in statement. “Everyone is welcomed regardless of race, ethnicity, religious or sexual background. We want to bring cultural awareness through our history, food, music and traditions. But also, start open dialogues by sharing migrant stories and social realities that make our countries unique.”

Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
Discussing Saturday’s matchup against Texas without invoking the legendary 2006 Rose Bowl proves to be an impossible task. FOX (the network airing the contest) released a stirring promo complete with images of Vince Young’s championship-winning touchdown and words about unfinished business between the two schools. In the lead-up to Saturday, The Los Angeles Times ran a three-part story about the lasting impacts of one of the greatest college football games ever played. 
Despite the game’s billing as a rematch 10 years in the making, head coach Clay Helton refuses to delve too deep into the narrative.
“It was 12 years ago,” Helton said. “I think the reality is our players understand how important it is to our Trojan family. Being an old person like myself, I got to see the game, I know the importance of it. Our kids are seeing it as the next step. This is our season, this is our time, this is our opportunity to try to get to 1-0 this week and 3-0 on the season.” 
This is not the same USC team that played in the 2006 National Championship, but if one squints hard enough, they look pretty similar. Over the Trojans’ first two games, running backs junior Ronald Jones II and true freshman Stephen Carr are reminding fans of the “thunder and lightning” days of LenDale White and Reggie Bush (who is who remains up for conversation). So far, they have combined to rush for 463 yards and seven touchdowns, each seeming to one-up the other with highlight run after highlight run. 
Meanwhile, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold plays a much different game than 2004 Heisman winner Matt Leinart did, but their successes mirror each other’s. In Leinart’s first year as the starter, he went 12-1 with a Rose Bowl victory over Michigan. Last year, Darnold led USC to a 9-1 record and an immaculate Rose Bowl win over Penn State. 
After a less-than-stellar opening game against Western Michigan, he returned to his original form in last week’s Stanford win, earning Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week honors for his 316-yard, four-touchdown performance. The Trojans’ balanced attack gained 623 total yards against a usually stout Cardinal defense. 
“We’ve worked so hard over this last year to really be the team that can run the ball when we must to win games,” Helton said. “They did a wonderful job of really establishing what our identity is, which is run the ball, stop the run and be explosive in the pass game.”
It was a long, winding road for the Trojans to get back to national prominence after the program came under crippling NCAA sanctions in 2010. Right now, Texas is in the midst of its own recovery. Currently on their second coach since Mack Brown stepped down in 2013, the Longhorns have not finished in the top 10 since 2009 (they carry a 57 percent winning percentage over that span). 
New head coach Tom Herman brings plenty of excitement and offensive firepower to the struggling program, but rebuilding takes time. Texas lost to Maryland in Week 1, giving up 51 points in a shootout; USC may now resemble its mid-2000s counterpart, but Texas still has a long way to go. 
Even though the Longhorns enter the Coliseum unranked and as 17-point underdogs, Helton knows better than to take them and Herman lightly. The Texas coach is no stranger to the art of the upset. While the head coach of Houston, he led the Cougars to shocking wins over No. 9 Florida State and No. 3 Oklahoma behind dynamic, high scoring offenses. This year, his team is averaging 48.5 points per game with plenty of playmakers at their disposal. 
“[Herman] has a knack for attacking every inch of the field,” Helton said. “He has a great interior run game, he forces you to cover the interior, with how many perimeter throws he has. He’s not scared to throw the ball deep.”
The Longhorns currently have three capable quarterbacks that are all likely to play against USC. Sophomore Shane Buchele is more of a traditional pocket passer. He threw for 375 yards against Maryland, but a bruised shoulder kept him out of the San Jose State game. In his absence, freshman Sam Ehlinger stepped in and showed loads of potential throwing for 222 yards and rushing for 48 (his dual threat ability may remind Trojan fans of another Sam). They are joined by run-first option Jerrod Heard, who receives snaps out of the wildcat formation. 
In defending the Longhorns’ spread attack, USC could be without junior outside linebacker Porter Gustin, who had surgery to repair a broken big toe on Wednesday. He was held out of practice on Thursday. 
While the team may not view this game as the heated grudge match most USC fans see it as, Helton did underscore the importance of Saturday’s game. 
“We talked about how much mental focus you have in a game like this,” Helton said. “You’re playing a very good team, and it’s an emotional game in a very live environment.”

Brennen Lopez | Daily Trojan
Currently undefeated, the men’s water polo team looks to add four more games to its win column as the Trojans head up north for the Aggie Roundup where they will take on No. 15 Cal Baptist and unranked MIT on Saturday, and Santa Clara and No. 6 Long Beach State on Sunday. While the Trojans have maintained a standard of excellence for the last four years by not losing a game until the semifinals each year, the team isn’t focusing on that right now.
 “I think no teams are going to take us lightly and we can’t go into any game taking the opponent lightly,” senior 2-meter Lachlan Edwards said. “But I don’t think we are even thinking about that … We want to take every game as it comes.”
The team’s eyes remained set on the finals, as it looks to continue to assert its dominance early in the season.
“It’s just important that we approach each game on a clean slate and … that we remain never satisfied,” senior driver Blake Edwards said.
While two games in one day is already taxing for the players, the team will have two games, two days in a row. Even being conditioned for these types of situations doesn’t make playing each game with the same energy and reaching the same goal any easier. However, the team is confident in its coaching staff and trusts that everything will run smoothly.
“You know, we have a really tough summer period, a lot of hours in the pool, so we’re conditioned for that,” Blake said. “It is obviously quite difficult, but we’ve got great resources in looking after our recovery and making sure we get back up each game.”
The team will face strong opponents all weekend, but it will be the last game Sunday that will be their most difficult. Not only is Long Beach State ranked No. 6, but the two also played over the summer, meaning that the Trojans know their style of play, and Long Beach State knows USC’s. 
“Long Beach are a very physical team,” Blake said. “We scrimmaged them quite a lot over the summer and we know that they are quite a tough, physically demanding team. So, for us, it is all about keeping up composure, sticking to our game plan and following our system.”
USC’s system now includes using key players from last season that have begun to make an even greater impact this season and even some freshmen already showing what they can do in the pool. The seniors have been playing together for three years, going on their fourth, but one of the team’s strengths lies with their ability to have players of all ages step up and make their mark.
“The sophomores are definitely stepping up, like Matt Maier, Thomas Dunstan, Marin Dasic and then our freshman Marko Vavic was awesome in the game [against Stanford] and really fired it up,” Lachlan Edwards said. “I think our seniors … know each other pretty well, and we are always looking forward to playing with these younger guys. They are really stepping up and showing off that they deserve a place on the team.”

LA Opera will simulcast its season premiere production of Georges Bizet’s Carmen Live on Saturday, Sept. 23. This year’s transmission with be presented in two separate locations: one at the Santa Monica Pier, and another in Exposition Park south of campus.
For the fourth year in a row, the simulcast — billed as “Opera at the Beach” — has set up camp in Santa Monica. With help from Los Angeles County, the program eventually expanded to a second location last year in South Gate. With multiple locations, the company’s goal is to provide free, widespread access to opera to the community. This is the first year the simulcast will be presented at Exposition Park.
Rupert Hemmings, vice president of artistic planning, says that idea to simulcast productions has been “in the back of [their] minds” for a few years. Though initially difficult to get off the ground, the company is elated to be expanding so quickly, and to be teaming up with a variety of other partners and vendors. At its Exposition Park location (named “Opera in the Park”), food will be sold exclusively by Smorgasburg L.A. as the performance is happening.
“Ideally, we’ll always be at the [Santa Monica Pier] and at least one other venue,” Hemmings said. “We were planning up to four or five venues this year, although we had a few contracts that unfortunately fell apart. But we’d love to do up to five venues all around the county in the future.”
Though Carmen will be transmitted live from the stage, there is much planning that must occur weeks, even months, prior to the simulcast date. The first step requires finding the right location to host the big-screen event. This can be a challenge, Hemmings states, as there are only certain locations that can be considered.
“The first thing we look at is feasibility of the site, and then we look at the location, and whether or not it is easily accessible by public transportation or parking,” Hemmings said. “The way it works with where it goes next depends on which district is going to pay for it that year, because it is entirely funded by L.A. County. We ask the county to submit some choices to where it can go, and then my team and I go out and view the locations, and decide which ones can or cannot work.”
Eventually the time comes to actually filming the show and having it transmitted live as effortlessly as possible. For this, LA Opera tagged director Matthew Diamond to head the process of capturing the performance. With eight cameras, Diamond and his team prepare a shooting plan at a dress rehearsal in anticipation for the live event, often weeks in advance. Diamond decides which specific angles and camera shots should be used in the final product. Through live cutting, much like any live awards show or sporting event, the pieces are put together as smoothly as possible. The shots are written in sequence and organized, and are eventually connected to two satellites that go directly to the two parks during the performance.
“The process involves, firstly, learning what the opera is, and then I make a camera plan while watching the show,” Diamond said. “The rules of the road when it comes to shooting an opera, as opposed to an awards show or sporting event, are that you want to tell the story. You want to capture the performances at their very best, and you want to make choices that make sense to the scene — between seeing the entire stage, or going tight on a close-up, seeing reaction shots.”
Diamond also stated that with the popularity of live broadcasting, there are high expectations from audiences for perfection.
“As soon as an audience is looking at a screen, as opposed to live on stage, there is a set of expectations that they have because they’ve sat in front of screens their whole lives,” Diamond said. “They expect it go seamless, and for it to go to the right face at the right time in the right sized shot.”
Though admission is free, those interested in attending are encouraged to RSVP online through the company’s website. Carmen is set to broadcast on Sep. 23 at 7 p.m.

Photo courtesy of Ballet BC
Ballet BC, one of Canada’s premier contemporary ballet companies, visited USC for a night of stunning movement, virality and artistic excellence in Bovard Auditorium on Wednesday evening. In a collaboration between the  Kaufman School of Dance and Visions and Voices, Ballet BC presented a dynamic repertoire of works by late 20th and early 21st century international choreographers. 
Founded in 1986 and based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Ballet BC is an internationally recognized company under the direction of artistic director Emily Molnar. The company is known for its innovative and cutting-edge approach to dance, making it a  trailblazer in contemporary ballet. 
The first piece, “16 + a room,” was an intense and rhythmic collection of sharp movements, crafted to highlight the company’s mastery of formation. Despite the jarring movements by dancers and aggressive music, the piece eventually presented itself in cyclic motifs, shared by each ballerina and the entire corps. While there was little emotion on their faces, the dancers pulled in the audience through innovative patterns, creating movement that elongated staccato notes and syncopated legato phrases.
The hoofers had complete control of their bodies, swiftly transitioning from sharp, rigid movements to smooth, fluid ones instantly. The stage felt almost too small for their expansive patterns and overwhelming energy. The stage lights created sharp planes and soft lines in direct contrast with the calculated choreography, highlighting the ballerinas’ elegant movements. 
With the futuristic, nearly incomprehensible music set against these dramatic lighting changes, the dancers became brushstrokes on a moving canvas, creating a portrait that echoed the Virginia Woolf quote accompanied with the piece on the program: “We [are] all being shot backwards and forwards on this plain foundation to make some pattern.”
In sharp contrast, the second piece, “Solo Echo,” was set to the music of Johannes Brahms and emphasized the connection and fluidity between dancers. In a Q&A session after the performance, Molnar spoke of choreographer Crystal Pite’s intention with the piece. “Solo Echo” was a reflection of seven sides of the same person. Beginning and ending with falling snow in the backdrop, the serenity of the performance was emphasized by the regal movement and sweeping patterns encapsulated the thin line between aloneness and loneliness. 
Again, in reference to the accompanying poem “Lines for Winter” on the program, this piece pulled from the idea of keeping on, of going on, and finally, of loving oneself. The impetus of every dancer’s movement came from another dancer, even in solo moments. The deliberate touches, lifts and stacked lines between all seven highlighted their connection and closeness.
The final piece played with the primal nature of humans and the vague unknown of the future, commenting on the vulnerability of the human body and its mind. Each dancer wore a greenish, garish-looking unitard, tightly tracing the silhouette and every curve. Thus, their repetitive movements and basic core strength were even more visible. Again, the 18 dancers in the piece represented 18 facets of a human being. The piece, “Bill,” began with individual dancers set in a misty green light, who carved space out of almost uncomfortably strange motifs. In fact, their performance drew bouts of giggles from the audience, inciting a deep discomfort with strangeness that spoke to a greater reaction that humans have with different behaviors. 
The piece’s concept felt far more disconnected than the first two performances. However, its strangeness lay in its intentionally skewed representation of a classical ballet by the choreographers, Sharon Eyal and Gai Behar, as Molnar explained after the show. In exploring the capabilities and the flexibility of the human body and mind, Eyal and Behar created a work that harkened to both the past and the future in an almost terrifying representation of the human being. 
These three pieces demonstrated the incredible ability of Ballet BC to mold to any idea, form or piece of music. 
“We do not have a conductor,” Molnar said of the process through music and movement the company underwent. “We conduct ourselves.”

Earlier this week, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton made a stop at New York University to promote her new memoir, What Happened. She was met with a strong turnout of young fans who defied the stereotype of all young people being supporters of Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The book offers Clinton’s individual take on the events of 2016, which saw her involved in two contentious races — one for the Democratic party nomination against Sanders, and the other in the general election with now-President Donald Trump. 
The year saw a great deal of previously unseen phenomena — overtly racist and sexist bullying, Russian hacking and the presidency handed off to a man who has boasted about sexual assault on hot mic, and mocked the disabled as well as prisoners of war. Everyone had questions, and everyone had opinions. Everyone was allowed to respond to the shocking events of 2016 in their own way. Everyone, that is, except for Hillary herself.
A recent Slate article titled “Critics Aren’t Taking Issue With the Content of Hillary Clinton’s New Book So Much as Its Right to Exist” nails it just in its headline alone. Even Clinton’s fellow Democrats, from Minnesota Sen. Al Franken to rival-turned-ally, Sanders, have protested the memoir’s existence, suggesting it’s time to move on. This, as if Clinton’s insights and reflections on the lived experiences of being called a “c—,” “b—-” and just about every word in the book, not to mention watching racism, ignorance and mediocrity marketed as “anti-establishment” heroism, defeat her more than four decades of public service and tenures as a U.S. senator and Secretary of State, are now irrelevant. 
But the shunning of Clinton and the degradation and mockery of her words all these months after Election Day have implications outside of the nation’s political sphere. The treatment of her speech raises the question of the treatment of all women’s speech, in a society where women, women of color and LGBTQ women remain widely underrepresented, where being interrupted and sidelined and spoken over even in those spheres where they are represented is, for most of them, everyday life.
On film sets, in offices, in university faculties and in nearly every sphere involving influence, hierarchy, power and authority, women are underrepresented. In courtrooms, young women who report being raped are called girls. Last week, one of Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal’s old, white male colleagues called her a “young lady” who “doesn’t know a damn thing” after Jayapal tried to contribute to the House debate around a spending package.
In her 2014 book Men Explain Things to Me, feminist author Rebecca Solnit recounts the experience of having one of her own books explained to her by an older man who was unaware she was the author, but cut her off numerous times as she attempted to interject to explain that she had written the book, herself. He did not apologize. In 2016, 60 percent of all comments made about abortion on cable television were made by men. Incidentally, 64 percent of all comments on the topic were inaccurate.
Threats of rape and violence — especially with the rise of social media — have become an everyday norm for female lawmakers, journalists and activists in the United States and around the world — sometimes not from online trolls, but from their own colleagues. In July, a male GOP lawmaker challenged two female lawmakers who voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act to a duel.
The everyday experiences of women of all ages, races and identity facets cannot be quantified, but anyone could easily survey the women in their lives to hear of similar situations and interactions. In the same vein, it’s difficult to prove to skeptics that women stepping down from academic and professional commitments due to harassment, discomfort in “boys’ clubs” and, of course, watching their speech be sidelined and disrespected.
To that end, we can’t watch Clinton be viciously attacked just for talking, without recognizing these attacks as a microcosm for what goes on everywhere in America today. On college campuses where right-leaning, sometimes Trump-supporting young people hold “free speech” as sacred, the overarching issue of implicit, systemic sexism silencing women and sidelining their contributions to campus debates and dialogues is wholly ignored. 
When Trump bragged about grabbing women – he was saying because of his celebrity – he was marveling at how women would allow him to grab them. Let me repeat – he was bragging about how women would ALLOW HIM to grab them. If that is consensual, how does that become sexual assault? I know this is the opinion section, but the writer loses integrity when writing such a false claim.
Before you accuse our POTUS of assault as opposed to typical locker room talk, please understand the legal definition, which is a threat of imminent bodily harm.  Touching that is unoffensive or permitted (as in: “they let you”) does not qualify as assault under either criminal or civil law.
If you want a factual and sex neutral account of how Trump won the election, I highly recommend In Trump We Trust, by Ann Coulter.
Is that how you talk in the locker room? Disgusting. Our boys need better role models.
Yup, and you should hear how gays and lesbians chat among themselves, especially in bars….
Oh, I do! I’m a lesbian and we have much better manners than Trump. Do you spend much time with gay and lesbian friends or are you just making wild assumptions?
You say “In 2016, 60 percent of all comments made about abortion on cable television were made by men. Incidentally, 64 percent of all comments on the topic were inaccurate.”
You are clearly not a stats major — and/or you think everyone else will be easily misled by this nonsensical statement.
I’m a victim, you’re a victim, we’re all victims, wahwahwah.  Grow up.
Sexism aside, Hillary is a verbally indicted, serial liar.  Her history of corruption is mind numbing.  Her career has been spent exploiting the people and institutions around her to load her bank account.  However, facts notwithstanding, Hillary can always be counted on to deflect and project those psychological elements that define a creep.
A great companion book to be read would be “Shattered”.  The writers were impeded in the campaign when so many decisions were made.  It provides a great perspective.

For students in California, earthquake drills and natural disaster preparedness have been staples of the state’s education system. However, when students arrive at USC, this practice is no longer prioritized. And in the wake of the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Irma in Florida and the Caribbean, as well as the damage done by a recent magnitude 8.1 earthquake in Mexico, the realities and urgency of proper disaster preparedness have become unavoidable. Particularly for the Los Angeles area, which rests along the San Andreas fault, understanding and preparing for the gravity of a future earthquake is imperative. 
Recently, the Los Angeles Times published an in-depth article stating that Southern California could potentially bear witness to a magnitude 8.2 earthquake along the fault — one that would impact all of the region’s cities. As a leading university with students from around the country and world, USC must ensure that it utilizes its resources to protect Trojans before, during and after such a potentially major event.
An earthquake at or above this level would be catastrophic — according to the Los Angeles Times, 1,800 people could die: by fire, collapsing buildings, by vehicular accidents. Approximately 50,000 injuries could incur, and Los Angeles County would experience the highest number of casualties by far. The earthquake would rack up $213 billion of damages. USC rests south of the San Gabriel mountains, in an area overdue for a major earthquake by a century and a half. 
USC holds a yearly Trojan ShakeOut Drill, intended for students, faculty and staff to rehearse behavior that could potentially save lives in the case of an earthquake. On USC’s Administrative Operations website, the proposed actions are described as “drop,” “cover” and “hold” in a one-minute drill. And yet, the drill is largely unenforced and occurs far too infrequently: the 2017 ShakeOut takes place in mid-October, a full two months after the fall semester begins. If students are spring admits, this wait time extends even longer —with potentially negative effects — if students are not from areas where earthquakes are expected and trained for.
In early 2016, nine apartment buildings introduced in USC Housing were deemed potentially dangerous by the Los Angeles Department of Building Safety in the case of a massive earthquake. These buildings — which included Century Apartments — were a fraction of tens of thousands of “soft-story” Los Angeles structures that posed similar risk. The University has been collaborating with USC Capital Construction on evaluating the apartment buildings, but building owners have up to seven years to finalize their retrofits after they are ordered by the city of Los Angeles.
Regardless, USC must consider the ramifications of a serious earthquake striking the Los Angeles area, taking into account the proximity of the Puente Hills fault, which runs under downtown Los Angeles — a magnitude 7.5 earthquake along the fault could prove more deadly than one from the more well-known San Andreas Fault.
At the very least, the University should be more proactive in making earthquake safety drills mandatory for all students. Last year, Stanford University — another California school that is in close proximity to an active fault — held a comprehensive disaster drill in which alerts were sent out on their text message notification system. In addition, staff members collaborated with the university hospital to mimic their collective response to the aftermath of a massive earthquake. 
USC’s annual participation in the Great California ShakeOut is significant, but involves a narrower implementation of earthquake preparedness drills than Stanford employed. With the catastrophic consequences of natural disasters fresh in the American psyche, and the city of Los Angeles passing legislation to address vulnerabilities in its level of earthquake preparedness, it is time the University took decisive steps to prepare itself for the next earthquake.
As in other aspects of the community in which USC has shown a willingness to be a leader, the University should be proactive in ensuring it is well-equipped in the case of a disaster. 
USC prepares its freshmen for various obstacles they may come across at the University. From alcoholEDU to sexual assault and consent education to the Undergraduate Student Government’s newest focus on implementing active shooter training programs, the University attempts to give its students the tools to confidently face their four years of college. However, the lack of proactive earthquake education and preparedness leaves students ill-prepared for not if, but when the big one hits.

Starting in Fall 2018, Building 9 of USC Village, Ilium Residential College, will house 350 sophomore honors students and become the first sophomore honors college at USC. 
The idea of a sophomore honors college began when the Office for Residential Education received encouraging feedback from scholarship recipients about the honors college experience, but recognized that there wasn’t enough room to host all the scholarship students, according to Director of Residential Education Emily Sandoval.
“The most unique part about living in McCarthy [Honors College] is that I am constantly meeting new people with extremely diverse interests and backgrounds,” said Justin Kawaguchi, McCarthy Residential Student Government President. “You are able to absorb so much knowledge by interacting with fellow residents … It’s a real privilege to make friends who share a passion for knowledge and appreciation of hard work.” 
To resolve the limited honors housing spaces for scholarship students, McCarthy Honors College was built in 2017 to house over 500 students.  According to Sandoval, the living and learning environment current freshman honors students are experiencing at McCarthy is expected to carry over to their next year in Ilium. 
“We realized that not all 520 of [freshman honors students] are going to want to remain living together … but a good number of [them] can continue that experience, continue the building of the community and friendship [they] have started this year, be able to interact with a new faculty-in-residence and be able to act as mentors to the McCarthy residents,” Sandoval said.
Ilium students will still participate in residential college events and collaborate with the Thematic Option program their freshman year. Sandoval also stated that the college will provide support to students who, despite having learned how to navigate academics at USC, are now facing the pressure of exploring professional pursuits. USC Village activities including Tuesday Tea with guest speakers and First Friday in the piazza will remain implemented for the following school year. In addition, there are plans for a sophomore success series that will include life and careers skill guidance for all sophomores at USC Village. 
The two dorms are mirrored off each other to ensure a smooth transition. The two buildings, Buildings 7 and 9, respectively, face each other. 
“Symbolically, McCarthy is connected to Ilium through the bridge, so we thought that looked very unique,” Sandoval said. “It would be a unique architectural feature to build upon in terms of bridging the experience.”
Those living in Ilium will have an apartment-style set-up with kitchens and numerous study lounges throughout the building. Like McCarthy, the lounges were built to reflect both academic and social needs. Some have cubicles and single-person desks while others have couches and TVs. 
Ilium’s current Faculty-in-Residence is Laura Baker, a professor of psychology in Dornsife. 
“[Baker] has a big focus on wellness; she teaches yoga,” Sandoval said. “She loves those informal interactions with students and loves taking students to downtown L.A. … I think our sophomore honors students next year could benefit from [the focus on wellness] … I think they’ll learn a lot from her.”
The Office for Residential Education began developing new residential themes last year with the RAs and Residential Student Government. Eventually the concepts were sent to the Provost Cabinet that voted on the idea of a sophomore honors college. But since the University housing renewal process occurred last year, the sophomores of Fall 2017 missed their chance. 
Currently, Ilium is a temporary name for the college. While the development office sells a name to a donor, the Residential Office is planning a lot for Ilium this year. The work that the RCC and RAs of McCarthy have done this year will translate over into this new sophomore experience.

Five graduate students from the School of Cinematic Arts will have their shorts screened at the DTLA Film Festival. The event will from Sept. 21 to 30 at L.A. Live’s Regal Cinema, and the five USC shorts, along with five from UCLA students, will be screened on Sept. 24 at 2 p.m.
USC Cinematic Arts professor and festival programmer Bita Shafipour picked the five films, using a 12-person shortlist she helped create as a member of the SCA scholarship committee. 
She’s proud of the group’s diversity, including a 50/50 split of male and female directors, with roots from across the world, including Germany, Mexico, Brazil, India and the Caribbean. 
“The fact that the festival is local is very special … it is 9 years old, well-established, very progressive and honors independent voice,” Shafipour said. “Most of the students come from that progressive [view]. At this stage they’re very fresh and unique, so the fact that we can honor that is very special.”
The festival is special for Nicole Danser, as it is her second-ever screening. Danser’s short, “F*#@k,” details the rise and fall of a relationship, tied together with circumstances that would often elicit the expletive.
Danser’s creative process can be messy — usually, her ideas for projects like “F*#@k” come to her in class when a professor starts listing due dates, kicking her brain into overdrive.
“I like thinking up ideas, developing it, brainstorming. And then I like the very end because you get to see the product,” Danser said. “Being able to know that you helped create the idea and then knowing that it has been produced and other people are watching it [is my favorite part], [knowing] something that is in your mind is now in reality.”
For director Kevin Alexander Gallo, personal life heavily influences his filmmaking. His short, “Morgan in Maywood,” details the story of a teenage boy, Morgan, caught in a love affair with his boss and the ensuing path to self-worth after he discovers his boss has a wife and family. It is set in Gallo’s home state of New Jersey, the inspiration and backdrop for many of his films.
“It’s my belief that you don’t have to overtly make films about politics or current events in order for it to have a political standpoint,” Gallo said. “So I draw a lot from my life, being queer, being Latino, and just like personal experience.”
Ronald Trejo also hopes the audience of his short, “Teacto,” gain more than just entertainment. The film follows a recovering alcoholic who struggles to take control of his life, inspired in part by Trejo’s family members who have dealt with alcoholism. Through the narrative, he thinks viewers will recognize that even in times of strength, faults exist. 
“In that plateau of happiness, whether it’s like ‘I want to buy a house’ or ‘I want to graduate from school,’ it may be the happiest time of your life but there might be that tipping point of chaos or losing control,” Trejo said. “And that’s really what I’m trying to say with this story, that there’s chaos in happiness.”
Like Trejo, Sadé Joseph wants the audience to experience new perspective from her short, “Good Girl.” A coming-of-age story following a Jamaican American teenager, “Good Girl” is loosely based on Joseph’s own childhood as the daughter of Caribbean American immigrants. 
She hopes by expressing her unique perspectives, the film allows viewers to see an often-ignored viewpoint.
“I think Caribbean American voices are particularly lacking in the industry, and it is a very specific identity and experience,” Joseph said. “I think people kind of group black people or black Americans into one group here, but the diaspora is so vast and so wide, and the black experience can be told in so many different ways.”
Starting a conversation, not just opening minds, is Sohil Vaidya’s wish for his short, “Geeta.” The piece confronts the issue of modern-day slavery through the lens of an Indian couple who brings their maid, essentially a slave, to the United States. 
Vaidya wants the audience to journey with the maid on her path to freedom.
“[Modern-day slavery] has taken so many different forms that sometimes it’s not obvious as we see it in the movies — like ‘Oh yeah, somebody is being beaten.’ But [the maid] still a slave,” Vaidya said. “In the real life I see exploiters who are really exploiters but they don’t realize that they are, and I think if they see this film, I think they will be able to identify themselves. That was the whole point.”
