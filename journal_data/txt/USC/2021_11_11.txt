New Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb will make her USC debut Thursday against Hawaii in the season opener. Gottlieb worked as an assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers for two years following eight seasons as the head coach at UC Berkeley.
After spending time at the professional level, Gottlieb has a fresh outlook on the role she plays as a college basketball team’s head coach.
“In college, I’m like the CEO of a small company,” said Gottlieb said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I have so much [to do] that I have to make sure to carve out the time to do all the basketball that I want to do to make us as good as we can be.”
One of the things that Gottlieb wants the team to embody early in the season is toughness.
“This is definitely a team that doesn’t lack talent but, in past years, maybe hasn’t been able to persevere through every tough time as well as you need to be an NCAA Tournament team,” Gottlieb said. “I’m just looking to see our ability to be tough and gritty.”
USC has an opportunity to settle into the new system that Gottlieb has implemented. Hawaii went 9-8 last season and suffered a blowout 83-56 loss in its opening game against San Diego this season.
The Trojans’ main concern in Thursday’s game will be Hawaii’s freshman guard Daejah Phillips, who had a solid performance in the season opener with 20 of the team’s 53 points and 4 rebounds. 
The home game against Hawaii will mark the first time since the 2019-2020 season that fans will be in attendance. Many Trojans have not played in front of a crowd at Galen Center, including graduate student forward Jordan Sanders who transferred from UC Irvine ahead of last season.
“It’s going to be really exciting,” Sanders said. “It’s something I’ve been thinking about since I got here last year.”
USC’s first road game will come against Virginia, which is coached by former USC player Tina Thompson. After only five games, Virginia canceled its 2020-2021 season due to an increase in coronavirus within the program and various injuries that left the team with few players available.
Virginia and USC met two seasons ago when the Trojans defeated the Cavaliers 59-49. Two of the Trojans’ three leading scorers from that game are no longer with the program.
One of those three players was guard Endyia Rogers, who led USC in points per game last season and transferred to Oregon this offseason. Sanders is next in line as she returns to USC’s squad this season as a graduate student and candidate to lead the team in scoring. 
“We just seem a lot more together this year,” Sanders said. “We’re ready to go right off the bat.”
Junior forward Alissa Pili, who had a limited sophomore season due to injury, is set to be a key scoring option for USC as well. She averaged 11 points and 3.8 rebounds per game last season, but her freshman-season averages of 16.3 points and 8 rebounds per game represent what she can produce when fully healthy.
USC faces Hawaii at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center in the team’s first regular season game Nov. 11.

Week 9 included some strange things on the football field. A linebacker named Josh Allen played the best game of his life. He sacked, intercepted and tackled a quarterback named Josh Allen, who played the worst game of his life. Elsewhere, the Denver Broncos gained a first down by punting the ball into the other team. Sadly, however, the most important things this week occurred away from the field. 
Loser: Organizational Dysfunction
Several weeks ago, I wrote that the Las Vegas Raiders — the NFL’s standard bearer for chaos and confusing management — were outplaying their more conventionally well-run competitors. At the time, I was right; the Raiders were 2-0 after defeating the Ravens and the Steelers, two teams that are often considered among the NFL’s best. Now? Well, the Raiders are still winning games. They’re 5-3. However, a slew of recent off-field issues will haunt the franchise.
The first unexpected exit occurred when a Wall Street Journal investigation unearthed a trove of homophobic emails sent by Raiders Head Coach Jon Gruden. The team quickly fired him. Another crack in the Raiders’ roster emerged Monday as cornerback Damon Arnette, who the Raiders selected with the 19th pick in the 2020 draft, posted a video of himself brandishing firearms and threatening another person’s life. In response, the Raiders released him. General Manager Mike Mayock called it a “very painful decision,” but reinforced that the behavior “was unacceptable, contrary to our values and … not how we will conduct ourselves in this community.”
Warning flags littered Arnette’s career prior to his release. Mayock admitted that “there was significant concern” about Arnette’s behavior during college “and most of the teams around the league were very aware of it.” Arnette validated those concerns last year when he crashed four rental cars in a single month. Now he’s done with the Raiders for good, and while the organization cannot be held entirely responsible for Arnette’s actions, they should treat his failure as a reminder that some character concerns never dissipate.
Between the incidents involving Gruden and Arnette, the team also dealt with an accident involving wide reciever Henry Ruggs III. He was arrested on DUI charges after he was involved in a car accident which resulted in a death.The police also found a loaded gun in his car. The Raiders immediately released Ruggs III, who faces up to 46 years in prison and will never play football again.
 The Raiders now bear a trend and reputation of concerning behavior. That might be unfair: For the incident involving Ruggs III, the team cannot be held solely responsible for their choices. He is an adult who knew better than to break a simple and commonly known law. He made a horrible decision and will spend the rest of his life paying for it.
Still, his actions and the other incidents will stick with the Raiders, who are missing a coach and two impact players as a result of organizational dysfunction and now have more important things to worry about than just football games.
Winner: Bad Football
A strange thing about football is that bad football makes for wonderful television. No one wants to watch a bad basketball game or two lackluster soccer teams play. Yet, in football, there’s something fabulous and perversely entertaining about terrible interceptions, hideous quarterback play and defenses that can’t decide if they’re playing zone or man coverage.
The NFL knows this, which is why it schedules games between awful, absolutely-no-good teams, such as the Washington Football Team and the New York Giants or the Carolina Panthers and the Houston Texans for primetime coverage every Thursday night.
Bad football reached its peak Sunday. The NFL gave us the Texans vs. the Miami Dolphins — a matchup between two teams so bad that it’s shocking they didn’t play on Thursday — and it was beautiful. Entering the weekend, no game this season had involved more than six combined turnovers. No game last season accounted for more than seven. The Texans and Dolphins delivered nine.
The highlights are comical. On one interception, Tyrod Taylor made the inexplicable decision to lob the ball in bounds on a throwaway. On another play, he was sacked by … nobody. He just slipped, I guess. The Dolphins also provided a ridiculous interception. At one point, quarterback Jacoby Brisset launched the ball straight into the hands of a Texans defender.
The Dolphins won the game but did absolutely nothing to earn it. They just made fewer mistakes than the Texans. Hopefully, the NFL takes note and schedules the two teams for Thursday Night Football next year.

With masks and Trojan Checks set into place, moderator Kathleen Verendia began the first in-person gathering of students and staff since the start of the coronavirus pandemic at the Fall Sustainability Forum. Hosted by the Environmental Student Assembly and DivestSC, the event took place Wednesday on the fourth floor of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and presented an opportunity for students to listen to and ask questions about USC’s sustainability efforts. 
The event panel featured four people across various University departments: Office of Sustainability Associate Director Ellen Dux, Office of the President Project Specialist Hannah Findling, Facilities Management Services Energy Manager Zelinda Welch and Transportation Director Tony Mazza. Environmental Student Assembly executive director Verendia, a senior majoring in environmental studies, moderated the discussion and opened the event by introducing each of the panelists and emphasizing sustainability projects the University has worked on now and will continue in the future.
“We’re going to focus a lot on what USC has done in the past few years and what projects we’re working on right now,” Verendia said. “Recently, especially with President [Carol] Folt, we’ve had a lot of energy and money put into sustainability on campus, which is really exciting, but there’s still a lot of disconnect with students not knowing what staff and faculty are up to and also staff and faculty not getting to know what initiatives students are interested in, so that’s what we want to focus on today.”
Each panelist discussed some of the sustainability efforts achieved on campus so far. Mazza described creating “great headway” to campus infrastructure with USC opening 237 EV charging ports on both University campuses in response to the demand for electrical vehicles. Dux recognized that the University achieved a silver rating from the Sustainability Tracking, Assessing and Rating System, a program dedicated to rating the sustainability performance of educational institutions across the country.
The discussion also delved into exploring efforts the University can take to increase sustainability on campus. Findling stressed that student involvement in sustainability efforts can make a difference.
“I really think that students have a huge role in coming together and in constructing priorities for the administration because you are the people who are funding this University,” Findling said. “You are the reason this University exists. So, if you come together and you care about something, and you make statements about it together as a group, that is so powerful.” 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan following the event, Verendia said that the forum’s goal was to “bridge the gap of communication between faculty and staff and students” because she wanted students to learn about the current sustainability projects happening on campus.
“I think what I was a little bit surprised about was how, when I asked about how students can get involved, the big thing that they emphasized was focusing on students connecting with other students,” Verendia said. “I think that was a really good point that they made, and they brought up some really good ideas about how we can, as students, use our voices to make change.”
Panelists also went into detail regarding the barriers hindering the University’s sustainability goals, which include financial restraints and the inability of the 22 schools that make up the University to act as a collective unit to tackle environmental issues.
The forum concluded with a question and answer section for students to ask questions about sustainability on campus. 
Eytan Stanton, a sophomore majoring in geodesign, was the first audience member to pose a question and asked if there existed a way to address dining halls throwing away leftover food after hours. 
Dux responded by admitting she was shocked about the situation since the University does compost all organic food waste but indicated coronavirus guidelines may be the reason as to why food may not be given to homeless shelters. 
Despite his disappointment in USC’s response to leftover food, Stanton said he still intends to hold the University responsible in its sustainability efforts.
“I’m just interested in understanding the efforts of USC with regards to sustainability issues,” Stanton said. “I think my money is going to a lot of things on campus, and I do want to make sure to hold the school accountable in ways that I can, and I think I appreciate venues like this, too.” 
Other audience members posed questions centered around whether or not the University would try to talk with community organizers and policymakers about environmental justice and how the sustainability efforts intend to tackle plastic usage on campus. Panelists responded that USC has already reached out to community members and created initiatives to change people’s behavior to avoid using excessive waste.
As the event came to a close, Welchen said she was excited about student involvement in the University’s sustainability efforts after listening to students’ thoughts and concerns and hopes to build a partnership with them.
“I think that was a good, diverse group of questions,” Welchen said. “It’s important that people are looking at this from a whole broad range of perspectives.”
ESA and DivestSC intend to hold another forum next Tuesday centered around the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. The event will feature a different set of panelists and will be moderated by International Relations and Environmental Studies Associate Professor Shannon Gibson.

USC Culture Journey welcomed students, faculty and staff Wednesday for a conversation over Zoom with Carl A. Castro, director of the USC Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families, about the transition from military to civilian life and shared experiences between veterans and non-veterans, such as the recent pandemic.
USC Culture Journey hosted the event in light of Veterans Day. Patrick Auerbach, associate senior vice president for Alumni Relations, began the event by introducing Castro, who joined the USC School of Social Work in 2013 after 33 years of military service where he obtained the rank of colonel. Castro started his military career as an infantryman and served in a variety of research and leadership positions, including director of the Military Operational Medicine Research Program. Castro also completed tours in Iraq and peacekeeping missions to Saudi Arabia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
His work includes more than 150 scientific articles and reports on topics such as veterans’ use of Telehealth and sexual victimization of LGBT military service members. His current research focuses on assessing the effects of combat operations on soldiers, family and unit readiness and evaluating the process of service members’ transition from military to civilian life.
Following Patrick Auerbach’s introduction to the colonel’s career, Castro shared more details with the audience about his research. Specifically, he identified the transition from military to civilian life as a troubling period for a significant minority of veterans and explores the best solutions to help veterans prepare for the transition while on active duty. To help non-veterans better comprehend the transition process for veterans, Castro said he often asks people to think about their own experiences with major changes like moving away from home.
“I always tell folks, ‘When you think about leaving the military, you have to think you’re moving to a new country,” Castro said.
For the rest of the event, Castro responded to questions submitted by participants via the Zoom question and answer, some of which were specific to the military and veteran experience and others pertaining to transitions regular citizens also grapple with. 
Castro explained three main phases of the transition process: preparing, transitioning and evaluating and making adjustments. In the preparation stage, veterans create plans for goals such as acquiring a job and housing. Plans vary for each veteran, Castro said, as some may wish to take time off after years of military service.
Prompted by the audience, Castro discussed the different transitions veterans have depending on their length of service. According to Castro, junior enlisted service members with relatively little financial preparation and resources, and veterans who are neither of senior or junior status, tend to have more difficult times transitioning after serving.
“If you’re a major lieutenant colonel and retired from the military, believe it or not, they have a much more difficult time transitioning because they’re not senior enough like the generals and admirals to get these lucrative CEO or vice president jobs, but they’re too senior for more entry level training jobs,” Castro said. “That makes their transitions more challenging in the sense of leaving the military and getting a civilian job commensurate with their experience and skills that they have.”
Castro also discussed the service members’ experiences with dishonorable discharges and clarified that service members who are discharged dishonorably are not considered veterans in the common United States definition of the term, which encompasses those who have served on active duty for at least two years, honorably. Specific organizations and other countries have their own definitions of veterans, which can shape the experience of service members and their available support.
Moving to more general transitions, Castro offered strategies for challenging transitions in the lives of non-veterans. He emphasised a positive attitude, highlighting its relevance with the ongoing changes at USC during the coronavirus pandemic, which some participants mentioned attempting to manage.
If you come in with a positive attitude — maybe [your situation is] not what you want, but you’re gonna make the best of it until things improve,” Castro said.

Los Angeles mayoral candidate and congressmember Karen Bass accepted a full USC graduate degree scholarship from former dean of the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work Marilyn Louise Flynn in 2011, according to a Los Angeles Times article published Wednesday.
According to the L.A. Times, Bass did not directly apply for the social work school, yet Flynn awarded her the scholarship. The House Committee on Ethics approved Bass’ request for the $95,000 scholarship, which Bass was initially unsure about.
Last month, federal prosecutors indicted Flynn for allegedly awarding a full scholarship and teaching position to Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas’ son in exchange for government contracts given to USC in 2017 and 2018. 
On Oct. 21, Ridley-Thomas pleaded not guilty, and, on Oct. 26, Flynn pleaded not guilty. 
Although Bass has praised USC in the past and met with University leaders at Capitol Hill and on USC’s campus, the L.A. Times reported that Bass denies ever putting forth legislation to benefit USC.
Bass originally applied for a graduate degree in public administration at USC, believing that she would be able to attend school for free because of her previous involvement at USC as a clinical instructor and physician assistant in the 1980s.  
However, when Bass discovered she would be required to pay her own tuition, Bass decided not to apply. Flynn heard about Bass’ interest in graduate school and offered Bass a joint degree in social work and public administration with a scholarship worth up to $95,000, according to the L.A. Times. 
In an email to the Daily Trojan, former vice dean of the USC School of Social Work R. Paul Maiden and Bass’ first year academic advisor wrote that “Karen Bass was a sharp student! She was also quite motivated to expand her advocacy work in the area of child welfare services.”
According to The Times, Bass said Flynn offered the scholarship to her because of her focus on foster care.
“I wanted to make it a prominent issue. I did in Sacramento, I planned to do it in D.C.,” Bass said to the L.A. Times.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University said that while it cannot speak for the School of Social Work’s policies from a decade ago, the school is now under new leadership that is “reviewing every aspect of the school’s operations.”
“The university also is reviewing its policies to see if they can be further strengthened to avoid any perceived conflicts of interest,” the statement read.
Flynn’s attorney Vicki Podberesky and Bass’ Director of Operations for Bass Jonathan Aquino did not respond in time for publication.

Bloom Boutique, a funky and sustainable resale boutique within the USC community, is redistributing donated clothing to raise awareness of fast fashion’s impact on the environment and labor workers. At pop-up sales around campus, you can find  unique items, which help keep excess clothing out of the landfills and teach about sustainable shopping options. 
Not only does the organization fight fast fashion, but, in a commitment to sustainability and social justice, the boutique also shares all of its proceeds with local charities such as the Downtown Women’s Center and Los Angeles Garment Worker Center.  
Casey Goldstein, a senior majoring in fine arts and the co-president of Bloom Boutique, has championed the club’s message and goals since her sophomore year.
“We take donations from anyone and any pieces of clothing,” Goldstein said. “It really is an amazing way for us to get connected with the USC community and also enable the circulation of clothing instead of the waste of it.”
For Kimberly Grabiec, a junior majoring in business administration and a member of the club since her freshman year, Bloom Boutique’s sustainability efforts are particularly appealing because of their focus on creating a difference locally.
“It stays really local and community-based since donations and sales all happen on campus,” Grabiec said. “Then we donate proceeds to local organizations, so I think that’s really cool because you really see where things are coming from and where they’re going.”
Sophie Hall, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said they joined Bloom Boutique because of their interest in the fashion industry.
“What drew me to Bloom, specifically, was first, Bloom’s values of sustainability, based in upcycling clothes and using the resources we have to create things that are more unique and just more exciting,” Hall said. “But, there’s also the element that we have of donating to charity … and the proceeds go to  different things.”
Hall works for Bloom Boutique’s creative team, where they spend their time as a stylist doing photoshoots to promote events and sales and creating content for the club’s zine, which is a publication that highlights Bloom’s emphasis on fashion and sustainability driven values.
Bloom Boutique created the zine  last spring as a way for the organization to keep creating during the pandemic, Hall said. Through poems, writing, photoshoots and doodles, the club was able to work together during a time they were physically apart. 
After the coronavirus hindered the ability to host events and clothing drives, the organization is shifting back to its in-person presence. During the pandemic, a lot of its clothing sales were virtual and centered around Depop as well as its social media and website. Now, the club is having in-person meetings, clothing drives called “upcycling days” and sales.
Within Bloom Boutique, there are multiple subcommittees that tailor to each aspect of the club. In addition to the sales team that organizes the clothing sales that garner lots of interest, Bloom Boutique produces editorial content, conducts photo shoots and distributes a newsletter, offering a variety of ways to share their message of sustainability. 
“It’s a group of people that recognize that there’s a lot of complexity to the fashion industry, as well as the importance of sustainability in it … It’s not your average fashion-related club,” Hall said. “There’s so much more to it that relates to values and relates to finding people with common interests.” 
This organization of the club allows for general members to look into each department and feel comfortable trying new things, Grabiec said. 
“You’re really able to do whatever you want as a general member, in terms of mixing together different groups in the club,” Grabiec said. “If you have any projects in mind or any things you want to do, you can just bring it up to your eboard leader and make it happen.” 
Bloom Boutique plans to continue raising awareness for the exploited and underserved communities of the fashion industry, while emphasizing a sustainable approach to the industry that fights back against fast fashion. According to Grabiec, the club is continuing to have the difficult and complicated conversations that come with fashion sustainability, including the ethics of reselling and thrifting.
“I think that [conversation] was pretty important since we are a thrifting club, so it was cool that we were able to sit down and recognize the negative sides of that, too, so we could work toward improving the club,” Grabiec said. 
Beyond the power of Bloom Boutique’s sustainable practices, Goldstein cherished the organization because, from the moment she became a part of the Bloom community, she knew it was an amazing community of like-minded sustainable creatives.
“Aside from just our mission, it is just like an amazing group, every single person in it,” Goldstein said. “Everyone wants to be there and be a part of the community, so it really is an amazing culture.”

Growing up in the suburban Midwest, specifically Kansas City, Mo., the idea of Americanism has been deeply ingrained in Midwesterners as a means of patriotic living. This idea, in a traditional sense, is deeply rooted in the American Dream, a concept which entails beginning a pattern of generational wealth based on the acquisition of farmland, later defined as simply a means of working hard for your success. 
In the Midwest, where fewer job opportunities are found yet exploration is discouraged, Midwest emo in the ‘90s sprouted as an art movement to counteract this standard by displaying teenage emotion. A subgenre of emo, this genre was created to put emphasis on the emotional aspects of a Midwestern teen’s life, including the downsides of suburban living, romance and friendships, aspects less accounted for in the pressure to attain the American Dream. 
However, throughout history, this ideal has almost exclusively considered the standard person that it fits, a one-dimensional identity: a cisgender, heterosexual white person. In our revolutionized society where queerness and identity is further explored than ever before, this ideal does not work with its original demographics,and is, in fact, being mended as we speak.
After speaking with my classmate Rishi Malay, who I discovered was a Kansas City native like myself, I was also able to talk with his band, Midwest Telegram. Based out of Kansas City, this band collectively reflects queer and communities of color while, simultaneously, being a Midwest emo band, a traditionally American concept. In their existence through this band, they redefine what it means to be an American in a perspective that our modern world deserves. 
Collaborating as a group of high school friends, the Midwest Telegram released its first self-titled EP September 2021. Lyrics such as “I’m suffering from the American Spirit Blues / Looking for salvation in my church pew” from the track “American Spirit Blues” and “I want a cure for my suburban misery / Want to be a part of this new century” from “Suburban Misery” give insight into the unrealistic expectations placed upon Midwestern teenagers as part of the Midwest’s majorly conservative demographic. 
The band details that, given this artistic avenue, they are able to better understand the meaning of Americanism in their identities that challenge the ideal. The American Dream is supposed to be an attainable goal according to the Declaration of Independence, which claims all are created equal and have the right to the pursuit of happiness.  
Despite the intentions of fairness displayed in the Declaration of Independence, the American Dream is not realistically attainable for all. As the American Dream begins in the workplace, it’s important to examine the challenges that both people in the LGBTQ+ community and people of color face in these environments. 
The Catalyst’s Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Workplace Issues shows that 32% of individuals of color on the LGBTQ+ spectrum have experienced workplace discrimination, while 13% of these individuals who are white have received this treatment. Even more impactful in terms of the American Dream, 22% of LGBTQ+ individuals have reported to receive less promotions and/or pay than their cisgender and heterosexual counterparts. As workplace challenges persist for those of the queer spectrum, it is clear that the American Dream falls short in including all individuals.
Likewise, people of color — who identifiy as queer or non-queer — face obstacles which make this ideal fall short of perfect. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, non-Western names face job acceptance difficulties within the United States market. Another challenge prominent in communities of color in the U.S job market is implicit bias, which bleeds into applicant selection. 
With these challenges present for the LGBTQ+ community and communities of color in the U.S., the exploration of the American identity is much more difficult for teenagers to fulfill. 
Meghana Lakkireddy, a member of Midwest Telegram, said that while the aspect of starting a band is traditionally very American, their personal heritage and their queerness as a group exemplifies a unique American experience. For Lakkireddy, the multidimensional members of Midwest Telegram subverts the American identity in a beautiful way. 
“I feel like the way that we’re doing it is like, through the lens of like [Lakkiereddy’s] immigrant parents and her grandma, who doesn’t know English, and is [still] greeting everybody when they come in,” Lakkireddy said. “That, in addition to the ties that we have to each other because we’re queer — those subtleties and how we experience things like band practice or the songwriting process makes us very unique.”
For the new American individual in the 21st century, the American identity is explored through the lens of a proud sense of individuality, rather than conforming to the American Dream’s standards. Using the genre of Midwest emo as a way to combat the pressure behind limiting oneself to achieve their dreams in the patriotic way, this band is representative of the new wave of intersectional teens which challenge the typical norms of suburbia. 
Another member of the Midwest Telegram, Willow Maclvor, said the Kansas City she experienced while being a closeted trans girl for the majority of high school was less gratifying; however, after coming out, she is now able to better enjoy Kansas City. By defying the cisgender standard that Midwestern suburbia places on youth, Maclvor found a sense of belonging. 
As our society becomes socially welcoming to individuals of color and the LGBTQ+ community, not only does the idea of the American Dream in its origins become unfit for our world but also through the existence of youth who proudly express their identities such as the Midwest Telegram, Americanism is being redefined.

There’s nothing like the feeling of when the movie theater grows dark and the film begins to play. The silver screen in front of you spins a tale of drama, romance or comedy, all while you shovel handful after handful of popcorn down your throat.
Yet, motion pictures would be nothing without the soundtracks that accompany them. Whether you crave a movie theater’s beautifully overwhelming surround sound or simply just want a good rotation of soundtracks to listen to while you wait in line at the School of Cinematic Arts’ Coffee Bean, this list outlines the best film scores to listen to right now. 
“The Grand Budapest Hotel”
In a soundtrack that is somehow as quirky and eccentric as the film itself, “The Grand Budapest Hotel” score accomplishes the romantic, yet thrilling, tone of the film. Starring monumental composer Alexandre Desplat, who is also notable for his work on soundtracks such as “The Shape of Water,” the score features a plethora of plucked strings to foster a contagious rhythm.
Desplat also brilliantly matches Wes Anderson’s shifting themes within the film, which range from absurd comedy to melodrama to romance. Perhaps the most profound song on this score is the main theme, “Mr. Moustafa,” a lovely tune full of charm that creates a pleasant listening experience for the audience.  
“Interstellar” 
Featuring a score from renowned composer Hans Zimmer,  “Interstellar” perfectly encapsulates an astronomical and celestial mood. The score, alongside the sounds of an organ, boasts electronic textures which serve to emphasize the film’s futuristic and serious tone.
At times, the songs are simply ethereal; however, they are also messy and jarring, which encapsulates the central theme of abandonment in “Interstellar.” A unique feature of Zimmer’s magnum opus is also his incorporation of atmospheric reverberations reminiscent of weather. The most impressive song of this score is arguably “Cornfield Chase,” as it builds upon itself throughout the song, starting from a quiet beat to a full out orchestra collaboration, to induce a sense of awe within the listener.  
“Whiplash”
Despite J.K. Simmon’s persistent claims of the soundtrack being “not quite his tempo,” you’ll find the “Whiplash” score impressive enough to transport you to the Schaffer Conservatory Studio Band.
Composed by Justin Hurwitz, the “Whiplash” score is successful in creating a competitive atmosphere, while also embodying the musical rhythm that permeates the entirety of the film. In fact, at times, the musical pieces are urgent enough to create a similar sense of anxiety found within the characters and plot. The score is also infused with the jazz tones structured upon in the film, featuring moments that feel improvised and groovy.
It strays away from a traditional film soundtrack because it doesn’t necessarily mirror the film’s organic progression; rather, it is more structurally similar to a jazz album. If you’re in the mood for songs that are sure to get your foot tapping underneath your desk, check out “Whiplash.” 
“Lady Bird”
If you’re in the mood for a score that reflects the quiet angst and confusion of adolescence, give the “Lady Bird” soundtrack a listen (at the very least, it’s Kyle Scheible-approved). Jon Brion, a multi-instrumentalist composer, is responsible for these mellow songs that accompany Lady Bird’s coming-of-age story, as well as the soundtrack for “The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.”
Showcasing strings, piano and hints of wind ensemble, Brion expertly reflects Lady Bird’s confidence and the hindrances that come alongside this growth. Diverging from traditional soundtracks, “Lady Bird” doesn’t push an audience to feel in a uniform way at the will of the song playing; rather, it’s soft enough to allow the audience to interpret each scene in a way that is most relatable and meaningful to themselves through the usage of subdued notes. If you’re in the mood to shed a few tears (or become overwhelmed with the desire to hug your mother), stream “Reconcile.” 
“La La Land”
Gear up for a “Lovely Night” if you queue up this score on your Spotify. “La La Land” features atmospheric instruments that mesh well with jazz to create a romantic and, when necessary, heartbreaking tone to accompany the film.
Following two lovers’ divergent life dreams, Justin Hurwitz expertly crafts a soundtrack that plays off of the scenes it resides in (as music is a very significant element of this film). In addition to highlighting a quick tempo, the “La La Land” score features a plethora of instruments; perhaps most notable are the hints of piano and boisterous horn sections. True to the film’s message, the songs fall in line with a sense of rigid curiosity and wonder, as demonstrated through bright sections of songs. For a sweet study tune, listen to “Chinatown” for the perfect euphonious background noise. 
“Little Women”
French composer Alexandre Desplat returns to create a pleasant soundtrack to tie into Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of “Little Women.” Akin to the structure of the film, the soundtrack is, at times, out of place chronologically to reflect the sequential order of “Little Women.” The soundtrack listens like a series of audible vignettes rather than a coherent score.
The most relevant adjectives to describe this score are romantic and aesthetic, as it effortlessly cultivates charm, wonder and warmth within the audience. This is reflective of the most important messages within the film, which include family, love and compassion. Rather than reflect music from the United States, Desplat hones in on his European roots to create simply beautiful waltzes and dramatic songs. For those of you facing unrequited crushes (and I apologize for the call out), you’ll find yourself enjoying “Laurie and Jo on the Hill.”

When Friday night rolls around, so does my classic Friday night tradition: snacking on Ben & Jerry’s Chocolate Fudge Brownie and binging “Schitt’s Creek.” In the sea of evil corporations, it feels good to check out with a pint of ice cream from a certified B Corp, or benefit corporation, that meets certain social and environmental standards. B&J’s is one of the 4,000 certified B Corps at the heart of this newfound intersection of corporate wealth and social responsibility.
However, B&J’s has recently been implicated by activists for its unethical but profitable practices, undercutting its activism toward Black Lives Matter and other social justice causes. This inconsistency highlights the company’s performative activism and speaks to the larger issue of how ethical companies cannot prosper. 
In the classic corporate model, opportunistic corporations worry only about their bottom line. B&J’s considers the triple bottom line of environmentalism, ethics and economy, but that begs the question: Does that make for a better company?
According to Jay Coen Gilbert, one of the B Corp model’s founders, registered benefit corporations “balance the interests of shareholders with the interests of workers, customers, communities and the environment.” The disparity between the traditional corporation and B Corps sets consumers up to believe that capitalism can be both fair and sustainable.
Although consumers herald B&J’s as a fair corporation, activists and social entrepreneurs alike point out that B&J’s focus on finances led to its fall from progressive grace. In 1978, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield founded B&J’s to be a company that did good in a way that most corporations do not.
Although Cohen and Greenfield worried about the triple bottom line, profit was their number one priority. During the late ‘90s, B&J’s stock dropped by 50% and the company endured a period of economic hardship. B&J’s received buyout offers from several companies, and its board of directors decided to save the company by selling it to Unilever.
According to an article published by the Stanford Social Innovation Review, Unilever is “a giant multinational clearly focused on the financial bottom line.” It repeatedly faced criticism for its unsustainable use of palm oil and its unethical treatment of employees. After selling to Unilever, B&J’s kept its own board of directors to pursue its social justice causes, but Unilever controlled its financial and operating systems. 
B&J’s continues to bring attention to social and environmental issues, but its profits fund and support Unilever’s unethical practices. The company tried to center the triple bottom line, but our economic system makes it nearly impossible for ethical companies to prosper. The Vermont ice cream company reminds us that survival under capitalism requires corporations to prioritize doing well over doing good.
Even after Unilever bought it, B&J’s has maintained its reputation as a company that promotes social responsibility. B&J’s is complicit in Unilever’s wrongdoings, but, in recent years, activists have implicated the company for their own actions. 
Palestinians called for a boycott of the ice cream company as it continued to sell its pints in illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The company profitted off Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories and the harm Palestinians faced. Although the company has since announced it will not sell ice cream in Occupied Palestinian Territory, it only made the choice once consumers began to boycott the product, hurting their bottom line. At the end of the day, it always comes down to sales.
A corporation’s decision to operate an ethical company is, like all things, motivated by its bottom line: Consumers feel good buying from companies that claim to be good. Thus, these companies use B Corp Certification as a marketing strategy to attract customers. 
This strategy is not powerful enough to compete with traditional corporate practices. B Corp’s central conflict is that it is not enough to make doing good easier. Instead, we must make doing bad harder.
The B Corp model convinces consumers of a market-based solution to inequity, delaying the potential for government action. The capitalist theory — those who work the hardest should earn the greatest monetary compensation — seems fair. But, in practice, capitalism is interwoven with white supremacy, the patriarchy and income inequality, which gives corporations that feed into systemic inequity a leg up. 
Policy change can reframe the system to make it harder for corporations to exacerbate inequity, but B Corps chase after a private solution to this public problem. Although government action alone brings no progress, any corporate-led change will continue to reinforce the capitalist structure that got us into this mess. 
We live in a system that pays the wealthy for perpetuating harm on marginalized communities, rewards wrongdoing and monetizes morality. In this system, ethical behavior does not exist. The problem is not B&J’s individually; it is a system that uses corporate greed as fuel.
However, politicians are beginning to wake up to the need for government action. In the 2020 Democratic primaries, Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s platform included the Accountable Capitalism Act, which would have required corporations to take the community and the environment into consideration when making decisions.
Rather than an opt-in system such as B Corp, this legislation forces all companies to participate, creating a fairer market for consumers and corporations. Legislation like this is our first step to creating a fair and sustainable system.

Humans are innately adaptable. Our species has evolved to inhabit nearly every region of the planet, from glacial poles to scorching deserts and everything in between. But our expanded presence has also massively disrupted many species and ecosystems, and this impact now includes our own human existence as well. 
Our unregulated modern appetite for fossil fuel consumption in everything, from energy, to food packaging, to transportation, to cosmetics and more, now threatens the quality of our lives, with the horizon looking worse by the minute. Climate disruption is already here, and the signals for us to adapt again are all around in plain sight. 
 So, where does USC stand on developing a sincere and effective climate response?
Fortunately, after years of indifference and delay, the University has begun to take a more enlightened and active role in this process. In February, the USC Board of Trustees voted to divest the University’s $5.5 billion endowment from all fossil fuel holdings, as these investments not only damage our global existence but also prove to be a financial risk.
Instead, environment, social and governance, or ESG, funds not only better align with our University’s mission and values but also provide more secure and profitable returns than oil, coal and natural gas. And, while this roughly $277 million change commitment from our trustees represents an inspiring milestone, USC must do much more to reverse its destructive dependence on fossil fuel consumption and replace it with a sustainable and regenerative commitment to our future. 
First, the University must make good on its existing divestment commitment and expeditiously. Students, faculty, staff and alumni are counting on this process to be transparent and effective. 
Closed door discussions and decisions on other significant University issues have not turned out so well for our community in the past. Divestment is an opportunity to reset this unproductive pattern and restore trust and engagement through collaborative participation from informed University organizations and committees, such as DivestSC and ESA.
Second, for USC to successfully reach net zero emissions, the entire University must accelerate our decarbonization efforts. Not by 2024, or 2028 — this needs to happen now through changes to our energy use, water use, transportation and, of course, financial investment choices. 
And, as we rapidly transition away from fossil fuel dependance and damage, we must replace them with innovation, equity and resilience, which includes generating curricula, research and community and business partnerships with these same values and goals in mind. 
Third, every student, faculty, staff and alumni community member can play a role in this transformation as well: We must change our own personal dependence on fossil fuels. 
Do you use one of the major American banks? All continue to heavily fund fossil fuel investment, so consider switching to a credit union or local bank which don’t. Ask friends and family members to do the same. Adjust your transportation, travel, food and entertainment consumption as well. Actively seek out sustainable, local alternatives. Be wise — think about your future and your kids’ futures each step of the way to sustainable and equitable regeneration. Adapt. 
Finally, get engaged on campus by joining or starting an organization focused on creating equitable solutions to our climate crisis. Every program, department, alumni group and community partner can be a source for action and positive change. The opportunity for solutions exists in future green energy and tech expos, research initiatives, regenerative startups, social justice advocacy and other actions we have yet to conceive.
