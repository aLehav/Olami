Rivalry week is upon us. As the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is host to the 91st edition of USC vs. UCLA, here are some key UCLA players that will be a thorn at USC’s side Saturday.
Senior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson:
The senior quarterback came into UCLA’s previous matchup against Colorado nursing a thumb injury, but it didn’t look like it rattled Thompson-Robinson. He put up 257 passing yards and 98 rushing yards with a rushing touchdown. 
Similar to freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart, Thompson-Robinson can flat out get it done all over the field, and it starts with his mobility. UCLA Head Coach Chip Kelly loves to draw up designed option plays for Thompson-Robinson to give the Las Vegas local a chance to make plays with his legs. USC junior linebacker Drake Jackson could put his stamp on this game by spying Thompson-Robinson from the line of scrimmage and limiting his breakout plays. 
Thompson-Robinson has played as starter for the Bruins since 2018. His numbers this year haven’t lived up to his stunning sophomore season, but he’s gotten better — and smarter — as his collegiate career has progressed. 
He has become more comfortable under center, navigating oncoming defenders, either firing from the pocket or breaking contain to extend plays for his offense. He possesses excellent arm strength and balance and can get the ball down the field when his offense is in need of jolt. 
Despite his confidence in his arm, Thompson-Robinson does fall into the habit of keying in on receivers, allowing for defenders to read the quarterback’s eyes and make a play. Look for the Trojans’ secondary and linebackers to come away with some turnovers if they want to send the Bruins home winless. 
Thompson-Robinson has shined in his two starts against USC. He’s thrown for a combined 731 yards and 7 touchdowns with 3 interceptions. 
Junior running back Zach Charbonnet:
Charbonnet is dangerous as a running back because he can hurt opposing defenses in a multitude of ways. Against Colorado last week, Charbonnet had just 67 yards on 17 carries, but racked up 3 touchdowns. He seemed more in the mindset of a powerback with his longest carry on the night being 9 yards. 
However, through 10 games this season, four have featured a Charbonnet run of 30 or more yards. Add that to his 11 touchdowns on the year, and Kelly has himself an NFL-ready prospect in his backfield. 
Charbonnet proved this season that he can handle a heavy workload and be the lead back for the Bruins. He has had 20 or more carries in four games this season, and it would be no surprise to see Kelly try to take advantage of a Trojans squad that ranks sixth in rushing defense in the Pac-12, giving up 163.2 yards per game. 
Redshirt senior defensive back Qwuantrezz Knight:
The Kent State transfer is listed as a defensive back, but Knight is much more than that. He leads the Bruins with 55 tackles and 7.5 tackles for loss — he’s all over the field. Knight even has 2.5 sacks to his name this season despite playing in the secondary.
Knight likely would have drawn the matchup with junior wide receiver Drake London for Saturday’s game. But with London’s season-ending injury, defensive coordinator Jerry Azzinaro can utilize Knight’s ball-hawking strengths on different parts of the field. 
He will match up with redshirt sophomore wide receiver Tahj Washington and sophomore wide receiver Gary Bryant Jr., two of USC’s best receivers outside of London. Azzinaro will likely shift Knight closer toward the line of scrimmage in hopes of getting him behind the offensive line and wreaking havoc. 
This is where having a mobile quarterback like Dart will aid the Trojans in suppressing the terrifying Knight, as Dart can get out of the pocket quickly when pressure is coming. 
All eyes will be on Dart and whether he attacks the redshirt senior or strays away from the vigilant Knight.

Interim Head Coach Donte Williams was thrust into the job amidst a tumultuous season.
Donte Williams
The former cornerbacks coach was called into action as the interim head coach when former Head Coach Clay Helton was fired in September. Since then, the Trojans are 3-4 under the direction of Williams. 
Most fans knew it wasn’t going to be all sunshine and rainbows for the interim. His value to the program resides mostly in his recruiting abilities, not necessarily his coaching, but he’s done his best to get up to speed with all of the responsibilities of a head coach. Williams inherited an angry fanbase, an underperforming team and the expectations that come with coaching a blue blood college football program. He has done his best with a dreadful situation. He’s kept the team afloat, and, although the losses are still ever present on the record, the performances have been more convincing. Namely, the Trojans showed fight in their loss to a ranked Notre Dame team on the road. 
The team still falls into the same errors and mistakes that cost it wins. Williams preaches accountability, especially when it comes to playing time, but it seems like that message just isn’t getting through to the players. The results of this season likely won’t be enough for Williams to secure the head coaching position full-time, but his efforts and character throughout the process have been commendable. 
Junior wide receiver Drake London’s season was one for the ages before an injury cut his year short. 
Drake London
London is the golden boy of the USC program at the moment. It’s not a stretch to say London would’ve been a prime candidate for the Biletnikoff Award for the nation’s best wide receiver prior to his season-ending injury against Arizona. While he was still playing, he gave the Trojans a chance by just being out on the field. 
It’s rare to have a wide receiver who has dominated the target share as much as he did; A staggering 38% of throws went to him in the games he completed. London dragged an inconsistent USC offense along with a mix of short passes, plenty of yards after catch and deep routes that seemed virtually unstoppable. He finished with 1,084 yards receiving and 7 touchdowns, including 6 games with over 100 yards receiving. 
London’s injury leaves a gaping hole in USC’s offense. The guy who could get the Trojans a contested catch in any situation is gone, tasking Offensive Coordinator Graham Harrell with involving other receivers and offensive options. 
Freshman Jaxson Dart will start for the first time in his young USC career versus UCLA. 
Jaxson Dart
The freshman quarterback was forced into action on Sept. 18 against Washington State when junior quarterback Kedon Slovis picked up an injury. The rest is history. Even after a slow start, Dart finished with 391 yards and 4 touchdowns, leading USC to its first win under Williams. It was a heroic performance, and it got fans excited for USC games once more. 
The hype was short lived though, as a knee injury that Dart picked up in his debut sidelined him until the Arizona game on Oct. 30. His return fired up Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, as “Let’s Go, Dart” chants echoed throughout the stadium in an uncharacteristic moment of energy. 
Dart’s ability as a runner provides new complexity USC’s offensive scheme, as opposing teams have to account for him scrambling as well as passing. His arm shouldn’t be slept on either, as he connected on a couple of deep throws against Washington State, the most notable a 38-yard touchdown throw to sophomore wide receiver Gary Bryant Jr. He’s shown some moments of inexperience, as any true freshman would, but he brings an undeniable sense of energy to the Trojans. The fans are behind him, and his electric play gives the Trojans a chance in any game.
Junior outside linebacker Drake Jackson has been scaring opposing offenses with determined play all season long. 
Drake Jackson 
The marquee player on the defensive line, Jackson is a physically imposing figure with freak athleticism. His versatility as a defender allows Defensive Coordinator Todd Orlando to get creative with his blitzes, of which there have been many. In a season where USC’s defense hasn’t exactly been making headlines for its dominance, Jackson has given fans some memorable moments. 
Jackson’s ability as a pass rusher stands out first, with a team-leading 5 sacks and a forced fumble. But he’s also made strides as a run-stopping option, with 7 tackles for loss on the season. He’s contributed to 2 turnovers this season; One was an interception against San José State, and the other was a strip sack in the endzone against Washington State. If he’s on his game, USC’s defense is all the more prone to takeaways. 
Jackson has been one of the bright spots in a lackluster USC run defense. The effort that he puts in on every play goes under the radar sometimes, especially when the defense as a whole has looked less than convincing at times. Teams like Stanford, Oregon State, Utah and Arizona State ran all over the Trojans. Things have looked bleak, but if there’s anyone that can provide a spark, it’s Jackson. 
Senior running back Keaontay Ingram has carved out a prominent role in the USC offense. 
Keaontay Ingram
The senior running back transferred from Texas and began the season as the No. 2 runner behind redshirt senior running back Vavae Malepeai. Ingram didn’t see too much action in the first few weeks of the season, but once Williams became interim head coach, his playing time increased. 
Malepeai and Ingram featured in a 1A/1B running back system, with both getting similar amounts of touches before Ingram started his breakout. He took 14 carries for a total of 124 yards against Colorado, earning the attention of USC fans. He has at least 14 carries in each of the last six games. 
Ingram’s top performance came against Arizona, where he rushed for a career-high 204 yards on 27 attempts with 1 touchdown. His emergence as the No. 1 running back on the depth chart is a result of his shifty and explosive running. He’s not shy about barging up the middle for inside handoffs, but his ability to break out for longer gains with intelligent running is what sets him apart from the other runners on USC’s roster. 
Against Arizona State, Ingram was limited in his impact due to passive run blocking from the offensive line. If the guys up front can get some push, Ingram will be in for a big game.

USC faces UCLA Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the 91st meeting between the two schools. The Trojans have won two straight meetings against the Bruins.
In mid-August, the AP Preseason poll ranked USC No. 15 in the nation.
Since then, the Trojans’ Head Coach Clay Helton was fired in week two, a quarterback conversation emerged between an early Heisman favorite and a true freshman, it lost it’s leading offensive player to a broken ankle and, last week, experienced the first coronavirus-related cancelation in the FBS.
USC fans have endured the lows of losses by an average of 15.6 points and the highs of winning by an average of 21 points. 
Despite this, energy and excitement are still high as the game approaches. 
It’ll be up to freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart to lead the way in his first career start, after junior quarterback Kedon Slovis was ruled out with a lower leg injury. 
“It’s definitely super exciting,” said Dart after practice Tuesday. “I wouldn’t really expect my first start to be in a rivalry game like this with all the emotions and just the history of it all. I am ready to go attack it.”
Dart will attack a UCLA team that is riding on a high after becoming bowl eligible for the first time in Head Coach Chip Kelly’s tenure. UCLA took down Colorado 44-20 last week to get to six wins for the first time since 2017. The Bruins fell behind 20-10 at the break but a 34-point second half explosion sparked the win.
Senior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson will take on the Trojans for the third time as the headman of the Kelly offense. Thompson-Robinson, known for his running ability, has made plays with his arm against the Trojans in his previous two starts. 
Although Thompson-Robinson holds a 60% completion percentage in his career, against the Trojans, that number rises to 70% to go along with his 7 touchdowns and just 3 interceptions. 
All eyes will be on the two quarterbacks. However, this game will be decided by the play in the middle. 
On the defensive side of the ball UCLA’s strength comes from its blitz packages. The Bruins run a 4-2-5 bullet’s dual linebacker blitzing defense, essentially using the two linebackers to rush the quarterback with frequency. 
This play style could cause problems for USC’s inexperienced quarterback but also open up some opportunities. Offensive Coordinator Graham Harrell said Dart will have to extend plays against the blitz-heavy UCLA defense. 
“One thing that Jaxson [Dart] does a really good job of is extending plays with his feet,” Harrell said. “There’s probably going to be times where he has to do that.” 
Offensive line coach Clay McGuire said the Trojans’ extra week of practice helped his group scheme for the Bruins dual linebacker blitz packages. 
“[UCLA] does a lot of stuff on defense. They’re a very aggressive, very attacking defense,” McGuire said. “Getting the extra couple days helps when you can slow it down for the kids.” 
On the flip side of the ball, USC faces one of the best 1-2 rushing attacks in all of the Pac-12 this weekend.
Michigan-transfer senior Zach Charbonnet is in the top five of nearly every statistical rushing category in the country. His backup, redshirt senior Brittain Brown, averages over 6.0 yards per carry. 
Stopping the run has ensured a surefire path of success for the Trojans. USC has allowed 93 yards per game on the ground in its 4 wins and 220 yards a game in its 5 losses. Meanwhile, the Bruins have rushed for over 200 yards in all six of their wins.
For Defensive Coordinator Todd Orlando, tackling continues to be an emphasis for the Trojans. Especially going against two talented tailbacks.
“One of the problems you have when you are running ahead of the football [to tackle] it’s the guys that are behind you are trying to figure out what angle you are taking,” Orlando said. “That’s the stuff we worked on fundamentally when we could steal a couple days last week.”
The Bruins have a chance to not only claim the victory bell this weekend but also slice USC’s chances of a bowl game to razor thin with a win. 
USC plays No. 14 BYU next week and UC Berkeley on the road the week after. Coming out of the crosstown rivalry without a win would put the Trojans backs against the wall and would require the team to sweep its final two games to get to the magic number 6. 
Redshirt senior defensive lineman Nick Figueroa said how much a win against UCLA can mean to this year’s team. 
“The rest of the season aside,” Figueroa said. “You win this game, it’s a successful year.”

When freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart entered the game against Arizona three weeks ago, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum noticeably exploded. The crowd erupted, chanting “Let’s go, Dart.” The stadium’s energy increased substantially. The Coliseum became lively again.
As interim Head Coach Donte Williams flipped between Dart and junior quarterback Kedon Slovis as if he was going through TV channels, I found myself asking: Why?
It made no sense to me then; it makes no sense to me as you read this column and it surely wouldn’t have made any sense if Williams did it again Saturday against UCLA.
Williams announced Monday Dart would start, not Slovis. Everyone knew it was coming and on Tuesday, they saw the news and sighed in relief. 
Sure, a leg injury to Slovis forced the change of hand, but this has been bound to happen. 
To put it lightly, Slovis has not had the year we all expected him to have, throwing 11 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. After he threw for a career-low 223 yards against Stanford and was booed off the field, it seemed like the writing was on the wall. 
He didn’t have a chance to bounce back the next game against Washington State because of an early injury and in came Dart.
The offense continued to struggle in the first half. But, in the second, wow, did Dart dash and drive his way through the Cougar defense. 
A memorable performance added juice to a Trojan offense that looked like it needed an IV at times. 
Dart’s blonde, flushing hair flowed down his helmet as he delivered darts to multiple receivers for touchdowns and huge gains. The air raid offense finally looked like a true air raid as Dart’s swagger and radiant personality bled through the TV screen. The line of black paint down the side of his face gave him the look of a gladiator and the leader USC desperately needed. 
Redshirt senior center Brett Neilon said Dart reminds him of former star quarterback Sam Darnold — the Darnold that led USC to its last bowl victory. 
“He’s a young dude, but I tell him all the time, he’s a leader,” said junior cornerback Chris Steele after the win against Washington State. “When he speaks, people listen. Today I feel like he played like a leader, too.”
Dart’s a leader that threw for 391 passing yards — the most in a Trojan debut — and 4 touchdowns.
Remember that? It was only two months ago, not two years, and the sequel is Saturday at 1 p.m. where Dart will get the chance to run it back. Get to the Coliseum early, get your hot dogs and burgers grilled and get your popcorn ready. 
You won’t want to miss this. 
No more struggling to find his rhythm because of a quarterback switcheroo. No more defenses making mid-game adjustments he can’t read since he’ll be on the field the entire time. No more guessing game from USC fans to see who will be under center.
It will be one man, one number, one eye covered in black paint and one electric quarterback that has already won over the Trojan faithful. 
If he’s USC’s future, this is his chance to write his story. What a stage to make his starting debut. USC and UCLA. Storied rivals in a huge game where stars such as Dart are bound to take off. 
It’s a Hollywood screenplay USC alumnus George Lucas would be proud of. And it’s a storyline that can captivate a Coliseum crowd that has been bleak this season.
However, it hasn’t been all fun and games for Dart recently.
He doesn’t seem to be exploding with the same force as the Washington State game. Remember, he suffered a torn meniscus just under two months ago. 
In the two games he’s been back, he’s thrown for  a combined 198 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 interception averaging a 56.9% completion rate. He’s also had 3 rushing attempts for 16 yards and a touchdown. 
Some of this can be attributed to the spontaneity of his appearances and some rust. There will likely be an adjustment period early on, but once the game gets going it will be interesting to see how Dart settles in.
USC will not be able to rely too much on the run game — UCLA is the second-best run defense in the Pac-12 but ranks last in pass yards allowed in the conference — which isn’t ideal since this passing game is still hurting with out Drake London. Dart doesn’t look 100% healthy either, making this appearance a little bit of a risk.
But, gosh, this match is now more intriguing and captivating with Dart getting the chance to lead USC in a full game. His incumbent Slovis has dominated the Bruins the last two games, leaving the door open for Dart to do the same.  
And this is not to take anything away from Slovis, who has been a great quarterback and leader, but in a season that is without London and won’t end in a prominent bowl game, seeing what Dart can do in a huge rivalry game is amajor storyline. 
If Dart can lead the Trojans to a huge win over the Bruins, it will surely be a bullseye.

Adam Jasper, Sports Editor
Prediction: UCLA 41, USC 31
I have a strong feeling there’s no way this game won’t be entertaining. We’ve stood witness to a number of blowout losses for the Trojans this season, but the crosstown rivalry game means much more than other conference games. Both of these teams no longer have conference championship game ambitions, but pride is still absolutely to play for.
Freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart will start the game and that means two things. First, USC’s crowd is going to be energized behind him, and he’s prone to make some pretty electrifying plays. Second, we might see some of his inexperience come into play. But there’s no reason to believe Dart’s magic has run out just yet, and his play will keep the game interesting. 
The USC defense versus the UCLA offense sounds a lot like a damage control situation to me. Can the Trojans do just enough defensively to stay competitive in the game? There’s a chance. Can they win the game off the back of the defense? That’s highly unlikely. This game will be UCLA’s to win if its offense is playing even at 75% of its normal capacity. 
In terms of how the game will shape up, I think it’ll take the course of many of USC’s other losses this season. The Trojans will hang in there in the first half, maybe even have a lead at some point, but, ultimately, the offense won’t be able to keep up with UCLA’s scoring output. 
Pratik Thakur, Assistant Sports Editor
Prediction: USC 27, UCLA 24
Let me just start off by saying that this is going to be a close game. Regardless of how the season has gone for either team, this rivalry always brings out some of the best performances from both schools. 
So, I don’t really care if UCLA beat Stanford away and kept a close game against No. 3 Oregon even as USC got blown out by the Cardinal at home and lost to Oregon State. 
None of that matters when it comes down to this crosstown rivalry in the Battle for Los Angeles. I would have given USC a higher margin of victory if Drake London was available, but things will be a lot tighter will be a lot tighter. 
However, I still think the Trojans will prevail over the Bruins for three key reasons.
The first is freshman quarterback Dart’s official start for the Trojans as junior Kedon Slovis recovers from his leg injury. Although it was an interesting experiment to see both quarterbacks take reps during the Arizona and Arizona State game, having one quarterback at the helm throughout the game will bring more stability to the offense. 
The second reason is the Trojans’ unexpected bye week after the UC Berkeley game was postponed. Since the Golden Bears had an unfortunate outbreak of coronavirus cases, USC has the luxury of extra time to prepare for UCLA. On the other hand, the Bruins still played Colorado and now have less time to dedicate toward game planning for USC, giving USC the advantage there for scouting. 
Finally, one of the most important reasons is the Trojans are playing at home in front of the fans. You might wonder why I would cite this as an advantage since USC has only won two home games this season, but I know that the student body and campus in general get much more motivated to cheer for their team when it comes to the UCLA game. Having fans riled up will definitely benefit the Trojans when they take the field. In the end, it might be the game changer.

Prediction: UCLA 34, USC 21
USC is playing uninspiring football. After firing Head Coach Clay Helton following an embarrassing defeat to Stanford early in the season, the Trojans have set records for all the wrong reasons. USC lost to Oregon State at home for the first time since 1960 in September and was defeated by Utah in Los Angeles for the first time since 1916 a few weeks later. 
Junior wide receiver Drake London was targeted on 38% of USC’s passing attempts in the eight games he played before suffering a season-ending ankle injury. London’s presence was missed by USC in its only game without him, a Nov. 6 loss to Arizona State. Freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart, who is making his first career start, and the rest of the Trojan offense will continue to struggle without their main target. 
UCLA has the worst passing defense in the Pac-12, but USC’s isn’t much better as both teams allow more than 390 yards per game. USC and UCLA average more than 400 yards of total offense per game, so I’d expect both teams to put up points. UCLA averages over 200 yards rushing per game, partially because senior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson is running for over 50 yards per game on his own. 
UCLA will likely try to spread USC’s defense out and empty the box to create running lanes for Thompson-Robinson, junior running back Zach Charbonnet and the rest of the Bruin offense. USC will likely go pass-heavy, attack UCLA’s secondary and try to create mismatches in UCLA’s defensive personnel.
Although momentum usually goes out of the window when these two teams match up, USC has too many things working against it this season to pull out a vintage win over UCLA. USC has defeated UCLA twice in a row, including its 18-point second half comeback victory at the Rose Bowl last season. The Bruins will look to carry their momentum into the game after securing bowl eligibility for the first time since 2017 last week. UCLA is trending in the right direction and, with memories of last season’s last-minute defeat fresh on their mind, they will have the edge Saturday.

Daily Bruin sports editor Jon Christon met with the Daily Trojan to discuss his outlooks on UCLA football and matchup predictions ahead of the rivalry game.
This interview was edited for length and clarity.
Daily Trojan: What do you think is the identity of the UCLA offense?
Jon Christon: They are a run first team, definitely. That’s what [Head Coach] Chip Kelly is known for is keeping the ball on the ground a lot. Especially in recent weeks, you can kind of see an emphasis with handing the ball off a lot. [Senior quarterback] Dorian Thompson-Robinson has been used as a runner more often. I think they started to add some more wrinkles with some creative play calling, some unique formations, read options, stuff like that that [Kelly] was also known for at Oregon. So you’re starting to see a little bit more creativity. 
D.T.: How much of a threat does Thompson-Robinson pose on the ground as a mobile quarterback?
J.C.: I would say a lot. If you would have asked me this at the start of the season, I would have had a much more reserved answer. I didn’t think he was a very smart runner earlier in his career. He fumbled a lot. He made bad decisions on read options, he would put his head down and just try to run instead of keeping his eyes downfield. But in the last few weeks, we’ve really seen a new side of him in terms of running. Against Colorado, he had a few really good read option pulls that he hadn’t shown at the beginning of this season. He knows when to scramble, which is a hard thing for a quarterback to do. A lot of times, they would try to make the extra play downfield and get intercepted. If the scramble is open, he’ll take it. If there’s nothing there, he’ll throw it away, which is something he really hadn’t done in his first three years. It is kind of crazy that it took three years for him to understand that but he’s finally starting to turn a corner as a runner. And it looks like Chip Kelly is finally starting to unleash him in that aspect too. 
D.T.: Who are some of the X-factors on the offensive side of the ball, and what are you expecting out of the skill positions?
J.C.: I don’t think it’s talked about enough how not great [UCLA’s receiving corps is]. [Redshirt junior] Kyle Phillips is great, he’s not really a No. 1 receiver, though. He’s more of a trusty slot receiver, but [Robinson] is throwing jump balls to him in the endzone, 30 yards down the field. He just doesn’t have the physical capabilities to go up against these really athletic cornerbacks in the conference, he’s only 5’11”. [UCLA] relies a bit too much on him in the passing game. The“best receiver” in terms of catching the ball on jump balls and getting open is tight end Greg Dulcich. He’s had a really good year and is another guy that [Robinson] trusts a lot. I do think there’s a possibility of a threat out of the backfield with [running backs redshirt senior] Brittain Brown and [junior] Zach Charbonnet. It seems like it just really depends on who they’re facing, so it’s more about matchups. In terms of running the ball, Brown and Charbonnet are, I would say, the best one-two punch in the Pac-12 right now.
D.T.: Without having to face junior receiver Drake London, how do you think the secondary for UCLA will fare against the Trojan receiving corps? 
J.C.: Before he got hurt, this was definitely [going to be] a tough matchup to say the least against the UCLA secondary. UCLA’s secondary is not good. Defensive Coordinator Jerry Azzinaro has had a rough season in terms of stopping opposing wide receivers. And obviously Drake London would just run wild on them with the 10-yard cushion UCLA gives every wide receiver. His being out will definitely help the Bruins, but I still think they’re going to be in for a long day on that front. With the amount of times USC throws the ball, I’d imagine they’re gonna throw it even more because they’re going up against a bad secondary.
D.T.: Senior running back Keaontay Ingram has had a breakout in the last few weeks. Who’s going to be tasked with stopping him in the UCLA front seven?
J.C.: It starts with the linebackers. They’ve been hit or miss. At the start of the year they [were] really good at stopping the run, a lot of tackles for loss, a lot of tackles at the line of scrimmage. Guys like [redshirt senior] Jordan Genmark Heath, [senior] Bo Calvert. So I would say the linebacking core is definitely who it’s gonna fall on the most. Generally UCLA has been a good run defense this year. The linebackers have to be able to actually convert on their tackles.
D.T.: What’s the confidence level with Kelly inside and outside of the program? 
J.C.: Within the program, all you hear are positive things. The players love him, the new athletic director has said nothing but good things about him. Within the program, his job is probably pretty safe. If they lose any of [their] next three games, I think it’s gonna boil over into a lot of frustration for UCLA fans. The fanbase is not high on him to say the least. They are tired of the way he answers questions, he’s never been great with media. He’s not very personable, and when you’re not winning games, that really alientates the fanbase. I think this game is big for him. If he can beat USC, he can regain the trust of a lot of fans … I would say he’s probably safe barring a complete collapse in these two games against USC and [UC Berkeley].
D.T.: Now that both teams are out of Pac-12 Championship contention, do you still think this game is going to have that same energy of a rivalry matchup? 
J.C.: I don’t think it’s gonna be like years past. It doesn’t feel the same, in my opinion. I think part of that, at least from our perspective, is that basketball came back. Obviously, the Villanova game was huge, and now football is kinda second in everyone’s mind. I don’t know if it’ll have the same juice, but obviously, it’s still USC, still UCLA. This is UCLA’s best season in four years, at least, probably more if they win a few of these easy games at the end of their schedule. [To] the players, it’ll still mean a lot. But in terms of the fan base, it definitely does not feel like it has. It’ll still be the biggest regular season game of the year for UCLA. I’m not sure how well it compares to other years.
D.T.: Who do you think is going to win, and what’s your score prediction for the game?
J.C.: I would say a 38-24 UCLA [win], I’m slightly more pessimistic [for USC] about [the Bruins’] offense against USC’s defense. The London injury could affect things. [UCLA] can limit USC somewhat. I think [Robinson] is gonna have another great game against USC. He’s really found something against [the Trojans].

During a Texas summer day in 2016, Carthage High School Football Head Coach Scott Surratt drove with his wife past the school’s campus. 
The weather was scorching hot — in triple digits to be exact — the norm that time of the year, especially at 1 p.m.
Surratt had made that drive many times, especially since he was now in his 14th season as head coach. But, this time, something different was happening. 
As Surratt drove next to the school’s indoor facility, something caught the corner of his eye. It wasn’t an animal or a group of people but one of his best athletes hustling during a workout. 
In the middle of 102 degree weather, senior running back Keaontay Ingram decided it was time to get some work done. He strapped himself up with weights and pushed them up and down a huge hill on the other side of the facility. 
In awe, Surratt quickly had his wife pull out her phone and take a video of Ingram’s workout.
“He was strapped up pulling weights up that hill and then going down,” Surratt said. “And I said, ‘He’s gonna be special.’”
Family football and being a “workout junkie”
Ingram lived and breathed sports from an early age. At four years old, he was already playing football and baseball, thriving in little league games. He picked up basketball too, and was on his high school’s basketball and track teams.
But, as the years went on, football became his love.
The football didn’t leave his hands growing up, as well as the company of family. He grew up with nine siblings, many of whom were older than him, and lots of older cousins. 
They pushed him in backyard football, unknowingly preparing Ingram for the future ahead. Ingram mentioned those many games were “just fun,” and considered normal for kids growing up in Texas, where football is a religion.
The impact of playing with older people, who didn’t go easy on him, was immense.
“When I got to be with my age group, I was a couple of steps ahead,” he said. “That molded me as far as how I think, just how I approach [the game]. I feel like I’m just more mature about everything.”
Ingram would play football anywhere at any time. Instead of watching the Friday night lights games, he and his family would play on the sideline. For Ingram, it was a way of imitating his dream. 
He wanted to be playing in those big games one day. 
“As he was growing up, he always had a football in his hand. He never let it go,” said Brandie Ingram, Keaontay’s mother. “He always was trying to do some type of training to make himself better [as a kid].”
Ingram calls himself a “workout junkie,” who has gotten used to working out alone and often.
His consistent work ethic began in a simple way. Ingram often suffered defeat when playing pee-wee football in the fourth and fifth grades. 
“I think we only won like two games,” he said. “I really hate losing.” 
Ingram’s motivation stemmed from this distaste for defeat and stuck with him over time. He became determined to improve, hating being considered “average.” Ingram began despising those who gained an advantage over him and improving in the offseason.
Ingram started building habits and a routine — something he’s followed to this day. 
“There’s nothing wrong with doing something that makes you uncomfortable,” he said. “Just going each and every day, you try to make it like a lifestyle instead of trying to chase something.”
Rabid competitiveness and commitment have fueled Ingram’s dreams. He ran all those hills in high school simply because he wanted to get faster and “break records.”
Those records were eventually shattered during his time at Carthage, but it didn’t come easily. 
Broken records and Texas football
“This is one I will never forget because I went into a panic as a parent,” Brandie said.
It was 4 a.m. when she woke up, deciding to check up on Keaontay. As she walked toward his room and opened the door, what she saw sent her into a frenzy — Keaontay wasn’t in his room. 
She began screaming her son’s name while walking all around the house, hoping to hear something back, but Brandie didn’t hear Keaontay’s voice. 
“I opened my door,” she said. “And I’m hollering [Keaontay at] 4 o’clock in the morning knowing I’m going to wake my neighbors up, but I didn’t care.”
The search continued as she exited the door. Brandie turned toward the side of her house and finally found Keaontay in his usual state — working out. 
He was strapped with weights on a sled, pulling it outside the house at 4 a.m. Keaontay said this specific early-morning sled workout was a usual thing.
He was still in junior high school at the time, but Keaontay needed to get work done and built a routine that he’s stuck to since then. 
“You put yourself on a routine … stick to that routine, I feel like it’ll be easier,” he said. “Just fall in love with the process, instead of the result. I try to live by that.”
The impact of those extreme workouts in odd environments is obvious when you see him run. Ingram’s hard, physical style makes him difficult to bring down. 
Despite his success at the youth level, Ingram was still far from scoring touchdowns on Saturdays. 
“What people don’t realize is after growing up, I was actually better at baseball and basketball than I was football,” he said. “Especially in high school. I was way better in basketball coming into high school.”
But, Ingram broke his ankle sophomore year while playing basketball. Coming off a strong sophomore season in football, he was put in a predicament. 
It forced him to make a decision and “helped motivate [him] to figure out what [he] wanted to do.” After committing to football full-time, Ingram’s junior year turned into a memorable one. 
Ingram ran for 2,244 yards on 320 carries and scored 32 touchdowns that season. Carthage ended up winning the state 4A Division I championship and Ingram was named the game’s Offensive MVP. 
All his dreams were coming true. According to Ingram, these were things he always wanted to do and the pressure never really got to him.  
Ingram always stays in the moment — controlling what he can control. 
“If you still weeping on something that happened yesterday, then what are you doing?” he said. “Regardless [of] what’s thrown at me, I control what I [can] control and just live in a moment. Just have fun with it.”
The fun continued during his senior season. 
Ingram increased his efficiency, broke the school’s career rushing touchdowns record, was named an All-American and selected as a finalist for the prestigious Mr. Texas award. 
When it came time to make a decision for college, it was an easy one. Ingram was going to the University of Texas. He spoke it into existence when he showed up to career day in a full Texas football uniform as a preschooler. 
He called the transition to college football “smooth,” but after three seasons he needed a change. 
Becoming a Trojan
Injuries and strong competition hindered Ingram’s time at Texas. The NIL deals offered in Los Angeles and the opportunity to market himself as an athlete at USC became too good to pass up when Ingram was considering his options after deciding to transfer.
But that decision to leave his dream school brought the biggest adversity Ingram has faced as a player, Surrett said. 
“[Ingram] knew he wanted to go somewhere else [to] make a name and play very well,” he said. “He just wants to play football. And that’s what he’s doing at USC.”
Ingram’s intensity was noticeable once he got on campus. 
He told then Head Coach Clay Helton not to take it easy on him. He wanted to work for everything and that caught the attention of USC running backs coach Mike Jinks. 
“He didn’t want any special treatment, he wanted to go out and earn his reps,” Jinks said. “It was the way in which he conducted himself that really allowed him to rise as a leader.”
Ingram’s career at USC began quietly. Helton created a 1A/1B running scheme with Ingram and redshirt senior Vavae Malepeai splitting carries, resulting in no games with over 100 yards rushing for Ingram the first month of the season. 
Once October came around, he began looking more comfortable. 
He had three 100- yard rushing games in four October appearances, including a career-high 204 rushing yards against Arizona. 
The chemistry between him and the offensive line improved drastically. Ingram realized some of the line’s strengths and weaknesses too, allowing him to improvise sometimes in games. 
Ingram’s sense of humor is an underrated aspect of his personality. He’s always cracking jokes and having fun in the locker room, according to redshirt senior center Brett Neilon. 
“I play all day, that’s just who I am. I don’t ever want to be too serious about anything,” Ingram said. “Because I feel like that inner kid tends to leave people when they’re trying to grow up so fast. What you in a rush for?”
But, when it comes to his play, nothing about it is funny. When he gets on the field his mood changes. 
“He was always joking around. But he was business too,” Surratt said. “He was on a mission.” 
Ingram’s mission could conclude after this season. He’s eligible for the NFL Draft and a strong finish could increase his stock. Like every step in his sports journey though, Ingram is focused on the now.
“I got goals and ambitions, but I can’t get to them until these next three games are finished,” Ingram said. “After that, [we’re going] to look forward to coming back or maybe leaving, I don’t know yet.”
Knowing Ingram, whatever he decides to do next, someone will find him at an odd time, pulling a sled of weights.

As we approach the end of the semester, people have only one thing on their mind: Finals. Studying for finals and hauling your backpack from study space to study space are always a bit painful and stressful. So, in an attempt to make it more enjoyable, I curated a playlist of eight trending songs on TikTok to jam out to this finals season. 
Katy Perry — “California Gurls”
Katy Perry put it best when she said “nothing comes close to the Golden Coast.” I mean, that’s why we all decided to come to USC, right? This early 2010s pop will definitely transport anyone listening back to a simpler time — one with no finals — and, just for a moment, you will be a tween jamming out to this song on the dance floor of a middle school dance. Most importantly, you will be reminded that the West Coast is, in fact, the best coast (sorry, East Coast besties).
Amaarea ft. Kali Uchis — “SAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY” Remix
If this song’s title is not the perfect title to describe everyone during finals, I don’t know what is. During finals everyone is a sad girl, but we grind because we love money and hope that doing well in college will allow us to become successful in our careers. While you’re questioning life in the sad Leavey Library basement, just remember you are doing it to get that “mula-la-la.”
Bruno Major — “Nothing”
Bruno Major’s “Nothing” is a sweet, soft song about the person we don’t mind doing nothing with. People on TikTok have used it to make small montages of their pet, significant other, friend or family member they want to tell “I’m grateful you’re mine.” The song’s lyrics will catch you reflecting on all of the moments you did nothing in college with your favorite people, but you won’t mind because they are memories you will cherish forever. 
Silk Sonic — “Smokin Out the Window”
Sorry Swifties, but Silk Sonic’s album release was the highlight of my Nov. 12. “Smokin Out the Window” would make anyone put on their most stylish fit on and sway in the middle of the dance floor. A groovy, R&B song that is so smooth you can’t help but sing along. Especially when Anderson .Paak sings, “Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die,” because that will be all of us by the end of the semester.  
Sam Fender— “Seventeen Going Under”
In “Seventeen Going Under,” Sam Fender discusses his struggles at the age of 17. While not all of us may relate to the lyrics, we have all gone through our own struggles, big or small. Seventeen is an interesting year — it is the intersection between childhood and adulthood. When listening to the song, we can remember how small we felt as seniors in high school or freshman in college and look at how far we have come.
The Young-Holt Unlimited— “Soulful Strut”
If anyone is like me, listening to songs with lyrics can sometimes distract from studying. But have no fear, “Soulful Strut” by The Young-Holt Unlimited still has an uplifting tone that can help make studying less boring. Not only that, this song would be the perfect excuse to take a study break and perform the infamous handshake from the Lindsey Lohan version of “The Parent Trap.”
Hilary Duff — “With Love”
In need of a Disney star throwback? Have no fear, “Lizzie McGuire” — queen herself — is here. “With Love” has inspired a plethora of videos of people performing the dance routine from one of Duff’s live performances of the song. Giving off the best early 2000s vibes, “With Love” will make you feel like a kid again watching music videos in your living room during the commercial breaks of Disney Channel Original Movies. 
Monsieur Periné ft. Vicente García — “Nuestra Canción”
The best way to describe “Nuestra Canción” is happy-go-lucky. It gives the same vibes as the feeling of being a kid in a candy store. The videos of the TikTok dance will never fail to put a smile on anyone’s face. If you want to perform the dance yourself in the middle of a study space or just take a break to scroll through the TikToks that use the sound, you will definitely get a boost of serotonin to help during the not-so-happy time of finals season.

Mary Hill-Wagner believes that as a writer, nothing is wasted. As a little girl, a love for writing was fostered with each book she read, but she was also increasingly made aware of the lack of literature that reflected the life she grew up knowing. Her new memoir, “Girlz ‘N the Hood,” is Hill-Wagner’s first stab at telling her story.
Hill-Wagner’s writing career began in high school as a newspaper editor. Graduating from Compton High School as valedictorian, she then went on to USC, writing for student publications including the Daily Trojan, and graduated with a B.A. in print journalism. 
Hill-Wagner reported for several newspapers around the country such as the Simi Valley Sun, Anaheim Bulletin, the Las Vegas Sun, Des Moines Register and Chicago Tribune while earning an M.A. from Ohio State University and Ph.D. in mass communication from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. She also taught as a journalism professor at several colleges and universities, including USC as a research assistant professor. 
“There’s a lot to learn about the theory about how media works, but it’s also good to have had your hands dirty,” said Hill-Wagner about her teaching experience. “I was able to bring that [expertise as a journalist] to the classroom, and according to my students, it made my class presentation unique.”
According to Hill-Wagner, inspiration for the memoir “Girlz ‘N the Hood,” published in September, was sparked by a USC undergraduate creative writing class taught by Clancy Sigal. The class was assigned to write about someone they personally admired. Hill-Wagner described being “amazed” that none of her classmates wrote about their parents, while she wrote about her mom. 
Sigal was intrigued by her writing. 
“He read [the essay], and he said, ‘You know, this could be a book’. And it was two, three pages. And I said, ‘No, I don’t really want to — I want to be a foreign correspondent for The Washington Post. I don’t have time for books’. And he said, ‘Well, no, just think about it’,” Hill-Wagner said. 
Years later, after three careers, Hill-Wagner returned to the idea inspired by Sigal’s early encouragement. Compiling letters, journals and memories from her younger self and her mother, Hill-Wagner wrote the memoir — her first book — centered on her mother, a strong matriarchal figure determined to raise Hill-Wagner and her 10 other siblings in South Central. 
Jaynie Royal, publisher and editor-in-chief of Regal House Publishing, said the memoir’s style was like an invitation. 
“[The book] has an immediacy to it, which is really appealing,” Royal said. “Reading the work, you feel like you’re there with [Hill-Wagner]. Her mother feels like a warm embrace. She’s so full of heart, humor and joy, which is also marvelous and astonishing given the adversities that she faced and the challenges the family had to overcome.” 
While there have been movies and books about growing up as a Black man in America from films such as “Boyz ‘N the Hood” and “Straight Outta Compton,” there was “almost nothing about the women and the girls in the hood,” Hill-Wagner said. 
According to Hill-Wagner, she faced challenges in journalism as a Black woman and even while pitching the book. As a reporter, she strictly kept herself separate from the story at hand, even amid the provocation of others. But this memoir gave the opportunity to tell her story, one that she knows is important, while fostering confidence in her ability to tell it. 
“It’s not a fairy tale. So some bad stuff happens. There’s drugs; there’s guns; there’s violence. But there’s also hope,” Hill-Wagner said. “And I wanted to be the message also, not just a lot of stories about how terrible women and girls are treated, because we are treated terribly in the hood and places like that, but also the possibilities that are out there to survive it. I wanted that to be the story [as well].”
Andrea Somberg, Hill-Wagner’s literary agent at Harvey Klinger Literary Agency, said the memoir was an emotive portrayal of a family loving and staying together amid poverty, racism and tough circumstances. 
“They keep on meeting these challenges and how Mary, but, especially her mother, this amazing strong matriarch of a woman, is determined to take care of her babies, take care of her children and does such a heroic job,” Somberg said. “So much of heroism is just the day-to-day, just getting through life, and I think that is very much a story about everything heroism.”
Finishing the book was a challenge Hill-Wagner said, because it meant revisiting not only fond childhood moment with family members but also the tough ones. Yet as she finished the work, she said she felt unexpected closure about what her mother meant to her years later. It was like getting a piece of her back years after she had passed away. 
“It was a challenge to remember all these things. To remember the fun things is fine, but to remember the emotionally wrenching things [was] difficult. And then to put them down, that was very hard,” Hill-Wagner said. “I used to remember some of the things that happened to my mother with great sadness. But, the sadness is not as acute since finishing this book, so it’s helped me in that way.” 
In telling her story, Hill-Wagner wants this book to encourage more women and girls, especially Black women, to share their stories without the fear of judgment. 
“We have such a rich culture, but we’re afraid of being judged, by these outside forces, by men and by white people in particular, I think. And so we don’t tell our stories,” Hill-Wagner said. “But we become resentful if somebody else tells our stories. We’re part of the American experience, and we should be proud of that.”
Hill-Wagner is currently working on a fiction novel, which she describes as a different but more joyful experience compared to her nonfiction pieces.   
“Someone asked me, ‘Who’s [“Girlz ‘N the Hood”] for?’ And I said, ‘This book is for anybody who had a mother, and anybody who didn’t. Which is everybody, really.”

I’m exhausted — that’s the lede. 
Simply put, I’m ready to close my computer after my last class on Tuesday and sit back knowing I have a few days to spend with my friends and rest a bit. But, in my heart, I know that my Mom will text me and tell me to save that Thursday for our annual Thanksgiving dinner. 
My family has always been a bit unorthodox when it comes to these dinners, grabbing tacos, Korean barbecue or Thai food in previous years instead of the traditional turkey and gravy. 
Regardless, this dinner presents an opportunity to get the whole “pamilya” together. 
Whether you’re a commuter who spends late nights on campus or a student far from home, opportunities to have dinner with your entire family may have dramatically dwindled to the equivalent of a fat goose egg. Friendsgiving aside, this upcoming Thanksgiving dinner may be the first time you get to see your family since they let you loose in Los Angeles for a few months. 
If you choose to celebrate it, you probably know these dinners can sometimes get a bad rap. The young liberal and the older conservative may go at each other while passing mashed potatoes, bickering on a spectrum of topics from masks to participation trophies. 
So, before you choose to relegate yourself to the kids table and wish you had just stayed at USC, breathe a bit. 
Let’s be realistic while we’re at it. In 2017, a poll conducted by PBS Newshour, Marist and NPR found that over 58% of Americans “dread the thought” of discussing politics during dinner. Conducted the following year, a CBS News poll of more than 1,000 adults across the country showed that only 15% looked forward to “discussing politics” and more than 40% actively wanted to avoid it. 
“But, Lois,” you, the inquisitive and burnt out reader, say. “I get the data stuff, but so much has happened since 2018. What about the literal pandemic we’re currently in? Wouldn’t those topics pop up in conversation and offset debates?” 
As we have seen on several social media outlets, the Daily Trojan Instagram among them, the coronavirus is a touchy and politicized subject that polarized us. In a practical sense, and from a personal standpoint, I’m generally tired of all the coronavirus chat and the negativity in the air. Attending USC nowadays is pretty tough, with controversy after controversy detracting from what it means to be a part of the so-called “Trojan Family.” 
Before I digress too much, I’ll get off my soapbox and defer any discussion regarding good mental health to other editorial columnists and staffers.
With everyone hopefully vaccinated or masked, families should be able to celebrate Thanksgiving like the pre-pandemic days, in larger groups. Given that we can share a meal with those who are still around, we should be coming back home with a sense of relief and humility. 
It seems counterintuitive to bicker over the type of vaccine we got — if at all — or anything incredibly sensitive in nature. While certainly problematic in its history and origin, Thanksgiving can still be an ample time to appreciate living despite the pandemic. 
But, say, through the powers beyond our control, the local high school decided to host its annual debate tournament at your dinner table on Thanksgiving, and you’re up to give the opening opposition statement. My evil alter ego, Lewis, wants you to go absolutely berserk. 
However, interestingly enough, my realist and practical side still wants you to respond, but maybe without the “berserk” part. In this day and age, accessibility of information gives us a sense of personal authority, which induces a god complex on certain topics. We inherently hate to be wrong. 
Challenging a relative’s thoughts in an hour-long discussion, if it comes to it, may ultimately just end with nothing productive. An individual’s thoughts and perspectives often still linger, even if we mention data and statistics in conversation. 
Here’s a sort of personal rulebook: Keep your arguments succinct, objective and civil, and be ready to defer or shut it down. That’s it. 
Enjoy being at home with your family. Finals are right around the corner, and then it’s off to the holidays and another new year — scary, right? You could talk about the new friends you’ve made, the old classmates you met for the first time, the classes you enjoyed, the exes you got over, the music you listened to and much more. 
With those you trust at home, talk about the friends you lost, the classmates you wish you had met, the reasons you wanted to switch out your major, the relationships that fell through and the music you listened to before crying yourself to sleep. 
Don’t make this Thanksgiving more stressful for yourself than it needs to be. You deserve the break — we all do. But when I’m cutting the turkey or getting tacos with my grandchildren a few Thanksgivings down the line, I’ll think back and say, “Back in my day…”

If invites to play Netflix’s “Squid Game” were extended to college students, almost none of us could claim victory as long as the game represents capitalism, which only the top 1% have mastered. Released Sept. 17, millions of viewers all around the world binged “Squid Game,” especially given its real life applications and implications. 
The Korean series became a breakout hit on Netflix, enticing 111 million watchers with its dystopian story that follows demoralised people on the margins of society — those who are unemployed, those who are impoverished, those in debt, those addicted to gambling, those who embezzle — playing children’s games with the highest stakes one could imagine: If they win, they secure 45.6 billion won, but if they lose, they die. 
This sounds a bit too familiar when compared to the context of the United States’ university system, given that U.S. News notes a $19,459 median federal loan debt among USC student borrowers upon completion of their undergraduate degree. Dubbed “University of Spoiled Children,’’ USC’s preppy and well-off student body begins to conceal the challenges faced by the silent minority. 
College has become increasingly correlated with prestige, encouraging cutthroat competition between students rather than ensuring education and financial well-being for all. Higher education’s prestige baits applicants with the promise of wealth upon graduation. Oftentimes, we scour U.S. News rankings as if a rise in a few positions would compensate for each semester’s absurd tuition. 
In essence, the show is a microcosm of higher education — the players portray students, minions represent staff, and the Front Man and recruiter symbolize authoritative figures within the hierarchy of a university. 
As a group of young adults, college students’ attraction to the show’s suspense makes sense — after all, it reintroduces childhood games to a group of 456 adults with far more dire consequences. Failing these challenges brings a competitor to their ultimate elimination, forcing them to miss out on the growing cash prize: an outcome likened to graduating and securing a job. 
At a time of social and political unrest intertwined with the ongoing pandemic, the job market is as hostile and competitive as ever. Recently, graduated students struggle to establish their professional lives post-graduation amid the ongoing coronavirus. The rising tension of finding a job in this time creeps its way into the mind of the players, evading their preconceived game plan. 
By the first elimination, every competitor, still processing the first round, is extremely tense — a feeling similar to that moment after you submit a final project worth half your grade. The stress of future games — midterms and projects — only minimizes one’s performance. Although we undergo stress when submitting assignments on time or cramming for tests, our stress does not match the pressure faced beyond the game. Very few of us have a chance to advance given the life or death situation. 
Taught to keep our eyes on the finish line, college students do not possess the skill to win each challenge and qualify to the next stage. Classism soon prevails as college students overestimate their intellect compared to other students of various educational and socioeconomic levels. By mentally positioning themselves within a social hierarchy, biased college students would get ahead of themselves and bring about their own demise. 
Bombarded by deadlines and midterms left and right, college students seldom complete each assignment to their fullest ability. Instead, they submit haphazard attempts for a grade. 
The small shot any student makes it to the end relies on an insurmountable amount of luck. Because universities do not teach students every possible life skill required to advance in their professional careers, how long will it take until their luck runs out and their figurative elimination from the “Squid Game” follows?
Although one may survive the first game, the next challenge will reveal a trust game, one far more horrifying than physically strenuous challenges. The “Trojan Network” can only take you so far when a piggy bank filled to the brim with cash is up for grabs. 
An evident divide exists between students and the administrations above. Hence, it is necessary to take the message of “Squid Game” at face value: We, too, are oppressed by debt and lack the societal infrastructure to escape it. If we truly believe that “Squid Game” reflects a horrific concept, we should look no further than our own society and demand that those in power end the menacing game of student debt. 
The fact of the matter is that not everyone studies for the sake of improving the world — many students strive for money and sustenance regardless of the stakes. As participants, undergraduate students would fear not only the harsh nature of the games but also the cruel world, with its lack of opportunities and second chances, that lies beyond. 
These thoughts would diminish survival chances within a system upheld by the socioeconomically privileged at the expense of marginalized groups. Thoughts of failure within the broken system will catch up to the players who are most disadvantaged, causing them to seek an escape from the perpetual cycle of advancing the 1% at the expense of the 99%.

After majoring in business at USC during the early 1940s, Jiro Oishi spent the rest of his life returning to campus for game days, dressed up in cardinal and gold. 
According to Oishi’s daughter, Joanne Kumamoto, her father was a Trojan “‘til the very end,” keeping up with University athletics and forever eager to take a jab at UCLA. Every year before he passed away in 2002, Oishi and his college roommate bought season tickets to USC football and basketball games. 
Throughout her childhood, Kumamoto said she believed her father had a degree from USC — in part because he always seemed so proud that he’d attended the University. Kumamoto didn’t learn the truth until she was nearly finished with high school: The University had never let her father graduate. 
After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which commanded the internment of approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans and nationals living on the West Coast. Oishi and 120 other first-generation Japanese American “Nisei” students studying at USC were forced off campus and into internment camps for the next three years. 
Following World War II and the closure of internment camps, former USC President Rufus B. von KleinSmid refused to re-admit the Nisei students who were previously enrolled at the University. When the students found other colleges willing to admit them, von KleinSmid then refused to forward their transcripts that were required to transfer course credits, stating that to do so would be “aiding and abetting the enemy.” As a result, many Nisei students were forced to start over as freshmen at different colleges, and others had no choice but to end their education without a degree. 
In May 2022, President Carol Folt will recognize Kumamoto and other Nisei descendants at the University’s spring commencement ceremony. USC will also issue a formal apology and confer posthumous honorary degrees to the 121 Nisei students at the Asian Pacific Alumni Association gala in April.
Kumamoto said she was “happy” that the school was taking the steps to make amends but wishes it could have “been done earlier” so that her father could be there to see it himself. 
“The timing on this was just not for our family. I mean, my father was sick and he had cancer and he passed away earlier,” Kumamoto said. “He had always hoped that the school would recognize their decision to not help [the Nisei students].” 
Jonathan Kaji, former APAA president, is also helping the University in the search for students’ descendants. In 2007, Kaji and professor Lon Kurashige began advocating for USC to offer a form of restitution to the Nisei students and their families. The two were able to get the University to agree to grant the Nisei honorary alumni status as well as issue honorary degrees to the students who were still alive. However, it took nearly 15 years to persuade the USC Board of Trustees and a sitting President of the University to agree to the formal apology and posthumous honorary degrees. 
Kaji said one of the biggest reasons he didn’t give up the cause was because he made a promise to his parents, who have since passed away, and “to do the best job” he could to have the University acknowledge the harm it caused the Nisei students. Although Kaji’s parents attended USC after the war, Kaji said they were friends with older Nisei students who were denied their transcripts and degrees. 
“To look at these old photos of the Trojan Japanese Club, when all these students were in their late teens, early 20s, and suddenly, after 80 years, be confronted with what they experienced, it made it a personal campaign,” Kaji said. “It wasn’t simply some faces in black and white from 70, 80 years ago — these were people that I knew, but I had no idea that they experienced this.”
In February 2020, law students Mirelle Raza, Sara Zollner and Jenna Edzant met Kaji while they worked on a research project about the University’s treatment of the Nisei students during and after the war. Following Folt’s announcement that the University would remove von KleinSmid’s name from the Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Center for International and Public Affairs building because of his history of antisemitism and public support of eugenics, Edzant, Raza and Zollner contacted the nomenclature committee, asking to rename the building after Kaji’s father, Bruce, who dedicated much of his life to advocating for racial equality. 
On Thursday, Folt announced that the University had selected a different candidate — USC alumnus and Native American historian Joseph Medicine Crow — for the new name of the center.
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Paula Cannon, the co-chair of the CIPA Naming Committee, wrote that Bruce Kaji was one among 200 other candidates considered for the new name of the building. 
“I wish we could have recognized so many of these incredible people,” Cannon wrote. “I hope that the name we finally did select in Joseph Medicine Crow will be seen as equally deserving as so many of these alums, including Bruce Kaji and the important work that he did.”
Moving forward, Edzant, Raza and Zollner are interested in ensuring legacy status for the descendants of the Nisei students, given that certain scholarships at the University are only available to relatives of alumni.
According to a Nov. 22 statement to the Daily Trojan from Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold, legacy students, or “scions,” are defined as “individuals with a direct relative who attended the university. That could include a sibling, grandparent, great-grandparent, or great-great grandparent.” Brunold also wrote that “if an applicant lists a direct relative as having attended the university, the applicant would be granted scion status. This would include descendants of Nisei students.”
For Kurashige, a professor of history and spatial sciences, he hopes to see USC open the University archives to allow the public access to von KleinSmid’s papers on Japanese internment from the 1940s.
“USC doesn’t show the presidential papers to anybody,” Kurashige said. “I mean, they really shut it down whereas other schools’ presidential papers are completely open — especially public schools, but even private schools like Brown.” 
In an email to the Daily Trojan, University Archivist Claude Zachary wrote that it is unclear whether or not the von KleinSmid papers still exist. When he arrived at USC 23 years ago, the papers were missing and nobody gave him a definitive explanation of their disappearance, Zachary said. 
When contacted about the posthumous degrees and the status of the von KleinSmid papers, the president’s office declined to provide a comment to the Daily Trojan.
Editor’s note: This article was updated on Dec. 14 at 7:07 p.m. to reflect that legacy students are defined as individuals with a direct relative who attended the University.
