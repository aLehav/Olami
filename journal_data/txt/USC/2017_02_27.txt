The baseball team traveled to North Carolina last weekend for a three-game set against Wake Forest before wrapping up the road trip with a one-off game against Duke on Monday. Though the Trojans (6-2) split the trip 2-2, the weekend came with many positives. After dropping the series opener against the Demon Deacons on Friday, USC rebounded to take Saturday’s game. Though Wake Forest ultimately took the series with a win in Sunday’s rubber game, the Trojans recovered quickly again, bouncing back to beat the Blue Devils one day later.
Junior third baseman Adalberto Carrillo came away with his first career grand slam in the Trojans’ 15-9 victory over Wake Forest, the second game of the series on Saturday. Junior starting pitcher Mason Perryman
(1-0) made the longest start of his career against Duke and went 6-plus innings, giving up no runs in a 2-0
victory. 
Senior right fielder Corey Dempster had two home runs, including his first of the year, a 2-run blast against Wake Forest on Sunday and a solo shot against Duke. Dempster also had a single and a double against Wake Forest in Game 2 as well as a running catch in Game 3 — an 18-5 loss — to help the Trojans get out of a
bases-loaded jam in the bottom of the fifth. 
Redshirt junior shortstop Frankie Rios also hit his first home run of the season, a 2-run shot in Game 1 against Wake Forest, which USC lost 15-5 on Friday. He doubled in two runs in Game 2 against Wake Forest. 
Sophomore infielder Dillon Paulson got his first hit of the year, a single against Wake Forest in the top of the second in Game 2. Redshirt sophomore pitcher Bryce Dyrda made his first start of the season with a 1-2-3 inning in Game 3 against Wake Forest. 
Wake Forest proved to be a very formidable opponent, scoring a total of 48 runs to USC’s 25 runs in the
three-game series. The Trojans were able to capitalize on many mistakes by Wake Forest, scoring two runs off balks and another run after the assistance of a balk. Balks are normally an unusual sight;however, the Trojans have seen quite a few in their short
season. 
Freshman left fielder Matt Acosta continued to dazzle in the outfield and on the base path with several nice catches and a steal of home in the top of the seventh inning against Duke. 
Sophomore center fielder Lars Nootbaar kept his bat hot with two solo homers, one each in Games 2 and 3 against Wake Forest.
Freshman pitcher Connor Lunn had a good outing against Wake Forest in Game 3. He went 4.2 innings in relief of starter Marrick Crouse, giving up three runs and at one point retiring five straight. Lunn struck out a career high six batters and gave up no walks. 
Carrillo’s road trip was more than just his 428-foot homer. He turned a double play in Game 1 against Wake Forest in addition to tripling and scoring the next inning. In Game 2, Carrillo singled in a run before hitting the grand slam. 
Sophomore pitcher Solomon Bates worked his way out of multiple jams in Game 1 with a strikeout looking and a groundout. Bates also struck out two in relief of Perryman against Duke. 
Sophomore pitcher Quentin Longrie (1-0) got the win for the Trojans in Game 2 against Wake Forest, going 2.2 innings in relief of starter Brad Wegman with three strikeouts and three earned runs on five hits. 
Given that Nootbaar had been one of the driving offensive forces prior to the road trip, it was good to see more bats coming to life by the likes of Rios, Carrillo, Dempster and Paulson. 
Excluding the exhibition game against the NC Dinos, Friday’s game against Wake Forest was Dempster’s first start of the season. 
The road trip showed that the Trojans’ team has a lot of talent and is able to utilize their opponents mistakes to the best of their ability. Not only were they were able to play long ball with the home runs, but they also stole bases and caused pitchers to balk. 
The young team continues to search for consistency after beating Duke and taking a game from Wake Forest. They will have some time to rest from traveling, with no games scheduled for the next three days. Up next, the Trojans take on San Diego on Friday at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

A fierce battle between the nation’s top two teams came down to the wire on Sunday afternoon at the Anteater Aquatics Center in Irvine, but when it was all said and done, it was the No. 2 women’s water polo team that emerged victorious and walked away with the Barbara Kalbus Invitational crown.
The successful weekend in the water for the Trojans (18-0) began with three straight wins over ranked opponents — including one over No. 3 UCLA in the tournament semifinals — and was capped off by a huge 10-9 overtime victory over previously undefeated and top-ranked Stanford in the title game.
In a rematch of the 2016 NCAA Championship final, USC once again got the better of the Cardinal as their overtime triumph kept the Trojans’ undefeated record intact and extended their winning streak to 45 games in a row. The streak, which dates back to the last game of 2015, bests the former record of 44 wins in a row held by the USC men’s water polo team from
2005-2006. Two more wins would put USC in sole possession of the women’s winning streak record of 46 games held by UCLA.
On its road to the Barbara Kalbus Invitational title, USC had to face four ranked teams in No. 20 Loyola Marymount, No. 7 Hawaii, No. 3 UCLA and No. 1 Stanford. In the process, USC handed the
Bruins (11-1) and the Cardinal
(11-1) their first losses of the season. But despite the fact that the victory over Stanford was considered an upset on paper, sophomore goalkeeper Amanda Longan and the Trojans don’t put too much stock into the national rankings.
 “We’ve heard it before, time and time again, but those rankings really didn’t matter this weekend. The task at hand was to show people why we should be ranked at the top,” Longan said. ”Even though we did earn our place last year, this year is a new year and we know we’re going to have to earn that top spot every single time we play.”
 USC and Stanford have combined to win the past seven national championships, and their first meeting of the season in the tournament final certainly lived up to the hype. It was a back-and-forth affair to start the game, as no team would move ahead by more than two goals. USC held a 4-3 lead at halftime, but after several ties, the score remained deadlocked at 7-7 at the end of regulation.
 In their first overtime game of the year, the Trojans would rely on the strength of their veterans, as junior utility Hayley McKelvey and junior driver Brianna Daboub scored two timely goals to give USC the 9-8 lead at the end of the first extra period. Stanford tied the game at 9-9 in the second overtime, but senior driver Ioanna Haralabidis ultimately saved the day for the Trojans, as her goal with just five seconds left was all USC needed to secure the 10-9 upset victory.
 Longan, who finished with
12 saves, was proud of the way her team kept its composure and withstood the Stanford attack. 
“It was quite the thriller because it was such a good, close game all around. We had to be on our toes the whole time,” Longan said. “But to finally meet up with Stanford for the first time this season, right after having played UCLA for the first time the day before, we wanted to be able to set that tone. It was a really good stepping stone for us this weekend.”
After posting wins over No. 20 Loyola Marymount and No. 7 Hawaii in group play, USC prepared for a
semifinal matchup against No. 3 UCLA on Saturday. The first crosstown showdown of the season was a close one, as there were multiple ties and lead changes to open up the game. A
four-goal second period for the Trojans gave them a 6-5 advantage at the half, but UCLA tied the score at 6-6 early in the third frame. From there, USC’s balance on the offensive end and solid defense allowed the Trojans to outlast the Bruins 10-9 and propel them into the finals against Stanford the next day.
 “Those last two games were all about energy, heart and who wanted it the most,” Longan said. “It was big for us to finally have games where we could just lay it all out on the line and then come out with the win. I’m proud of how we played this weekend.”
 Longan and the Trojans will now prepare for a short trip up to Cal State Bakersfield for a 1 p.m. bout with the Roadrunners on Saturday (Mar. 4) to begin MPSF play.

Yeah, I’ll admit it. I was that guy on Sunday afternoon attempting to be the voice of reason to those anxiously huddled around the television screen. I was trying to pacify a situation that I had no clue would conclude so tragically. 
Despite a 10-point lead for the Trojans with 3:57 remaining in regulation against Arizona State, I was surrounded by colleagues muttering, “Please don’t choke, please don’t choke.” 
“There’s no way — absolutely no way,” I thought to myself silently. I couldn’t conceive USC pulling off a major late-game meltdown to drop a much-needed game against Arizona State. With a guy like sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright out there who can nail free throws when he has to late in games, there’s no way that the Sun Devils would even get within a possession of the Trojans, right?
What ensued was depressingly ironic, as it was Boatwright who wound up making the most lethal mistake for the Trojans late in the game. 
A 3-pointer from Arizona State’s Kodi Justice cut the Trojans’ lead to 82-81 with 17 seconds left to play. On the following inbound pass, Boatwright — who finished Sunday tied with a game-high 22 points — had the chance to put the game on ice by just getting the ball to a teammate’s hands safely.
But the Trojans embodied Murphy’s Law late in the game on Sunday: If it could have gone wrong for USC, it did. 
ASU’s Tra Holder stole the inbound pass from Boatwright and went on to get fouled on a shot attempt. Holder knocked down the game-winning free throws for the Sun Devils and increased USC’s losing skid to four games. 
The loss seriously hurt the Trojans’ hopes for a strong finish to the regular season. USC finds itself on a four-game losing streak that has spanned the last two weeks of play; its last win came on Feb. 9 against Oregon State. The Trojans’ struggles in Tempe continued Sunday, as USC has lost its last five games played at the Wells Fargo Arena. The collapse in the desert dropped USC to 8-8 in conference play this year. With only a pair of games remaining in their regular season, the Trojans will need some help from Utah and Cal to finish anything higher than sixth in the Pac-12 standings. 
According to Kenpom, a popular sports analytics websites, USC was rated the luckiest team in the nation this season using an algorithm that takes into account a team’s strength of schedule, win margin and other factors.
I spoke with head coach Andy Enfield about his team’s unflattering top ranking following a team practice last week (before this weekend’s pair of losses). 
“Wow, I actually thought we’d be considered one of the unluckiest teams in the country this year,” Enfield said with a slight smile. “I mean, we were without our leading scorer (Boatwright) for 18 games, and we’ve had a lot of young guys — who probably didn’t deserve early playing time — fill in and do a great job.”
Enfield has a very good argument for claiming his team has been unlucky this season. In addition to dealing with Boatwright’s prolonged MCL injury, USC has faced the gauntlet of gauntlets schedule-wise — especially over the last two weeks. This current four-game losing streak, which includes three losses to three
top-six ranked teams, has wrecked a majority of the momentum the Trojans had in early February. 
The Trojans are the only team in the nation this season to play three consecutive games against three opponents ranked sixth or better nationally (No. 5 Oregon, No. 6 UCLA and No. 4 Arizona).
Think about it: The Trojans were 21-4 on Feb. 9 before their brutal recent stretch brought the buzz to a halt. Two weeks ago, I and many other media members saw USC as a sleeper team that could potentially make some noise in March, especially with a proven Cinderella-story coach like Enfield at the helm (Enfield famously guided 15-seed Florida Gulf Coast to the Sweet 16 in 2013.) 
Following these troublesome two weeks, in which USC has lost its past four games by an average margin of 14.3 points per game, the Trojans are one more bad weekend away from putting their  NCAA Tournament spot in significant jeopardy. 
In his most recent Bracketology report released on Monday morning, ESPN’s Joe Lunardi projected that USC will be a No. 11 seed in the West bracket of the NCAA Tournament. The Trojans have gradually slid down Lunardi’s predictions, as they were projected as a No. 7 seed as recent as Feb. 10. 
USC will conclude its regular season this week as it hosts Washington State and Washington at the Galen Center. A few weeks ago, fans viewed these last two games favorably. They saw matchups with the Cougars and Huskies as a pair of very winnable games on USC’s home court. Some may have even viewed this week’s season-ending homestand as a springboard into postseason play. 
Washington week will feature the Trojans playing in two not only must-win but also should-win contests. However, right now, it feels like the winnable games prove to be the most troubling for USC.

The Trojans split their road trip to the Sunshine State this weekend, dropping a season-first loss on the road to No. 4 Florida before bouncing back with an 18-3 hammering of Stetson.
The weekend began on a sour note for head coach Lindsey Munday’s third-ranked squad, as it faced off against a staunch Florida defense on Friday. The 15-10 loss stemmed from 24 USC turnovers, which the Gators took advantage of to maintain their lead throughout the game.
Four seniors stoked the offensive flames for the Trojans against the Gators, with senior attacker Cynthia Del Core leading the way with a season-high four goals, which also tied her career high. Fellow senior attackers Michaela Michael, Kylie Drexel and Gabby McMahon chipped in two goals each to round out USC’s scoring.
Defensively, the Trojans could not contain Florida’s attacker duo of senior Mollie Stevens and junior Shayna Pirreca, who combined for nine goals. Their offensive firepower handed USC its first halftime deficit since 2015, as the Gators took a 7-3 lead into the locker room. Florida extended the lead as far as six in the fourth quarter before a Michael goal trimmed the margin to the final score of 15-10. Michael also notched 10 draw controls on Friday, making her the first player in MPSF history to tally more than 300 in her collegiate career and adding a silver lining to the Trojans’ defeat.
USC then headed south from Gainesville to DeLand, Fla. to take on Stetson, where it rebounded strongly with an 18-3 drubbing of the Hatters. Four Trojans netted three goals or more: Freshman midfielder Kerrigan Miller led the scoring with a career-high five points (four goals, one assist), while Michael also pitched in three goals and two assists to grab her 28th career hat trick. McMahon tallied three goals and an assist, and junior attacker Alexis Kardias rounded out USC’s hat-trick heroes with three goals on the day. All in all, the Trojans outshot Stetson 27-11 and held a 13-9 edge on the draw.
Munday’s side also stifled the Hatters defensively, successfully executing a perfect 13-of-13 clear attempts. Junior goalie Gussie Johns didn’t have much to do guarding the USC cage, but she saved four shots while conceding one in the first half before making way for freshman Hannah Upshaw in the third quarter. Upshaw entered the game with a 13-1 Trojan lead saved two shots and picked up two ground balls as USC saw out its comfortable victory.
The Trojans enjoy a bye week next, so they will have time to recover from their East Coast swing before returning to the field. USC’s next opponents come on March 7, when Boston University makes the trip out west to try for an upset at McAlister Field. New Hampshire visits after the Terriers on March 13, and the Trojans will fly cross-country once again after that for a
four-game stretch in the Northeast.

Photo from TwitterFighting on · Heavyweight boxer Gerald Washington has vowed to come back after losing his first career championship bout. Washington spent three years on the USC football team from 2006-2008 as a defensive end.
Former USC-football-player-turned-boxer Gerald Washington lost a heavyweight title bout on Sunday, falling to Deontay Wilder via a fifth-round technical knockout in Birmingham, Ala.
Washington, 34, entered the fight as a heavy underdog after replacing two-time heavyweight champion Andrzej Wawrzyk — who tested positive for a banned anabolic steroid — less than a month before the bout was scheduled to take place.
The Vallejo, Calif. native won his first professional fight at the age of 30, knocking out Blue DeLong in July 2012. Since then, he had emerged as a legitimate heavyweight contender, with a draw against Amir Mansour in 2015 being the only blemish on his undefeated record until Sunday night.
Washington initially came to USC as a tight end in 2006, transferring in from junior college after serving in the U.S. Navy for four years as a helicopter mechanic. Under former head coach Pete Carroll, Washington made the switch to defensive end and recovered two fumbles and blocked a kick during his senior season. After trying his hand at the professional level with the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks’ practice squads, Washington moved on to boxing full-time.
He got his Rocky opportunity over the weekend, challenging the undefeated Wilder (38-0, 37 KOs) for his belt as a little-known contender. Washington (18-1-1, 12 KOs) started the fight strongly. He mostly kept the 31-year-old Wilder at a distance using a firm jab that seemed to catch the champion off-guard early on.
A native of Tuscaloosa, Ala., Wilder enjoyed a significant home-field advantage on Sunday. With a raucous crowd at his back, Wilder managed to land a thunderous right hand across Washington’s face in the fifth round that knocked him to the canvas. Washington was able to beat the count, but the bout was stopped not long after as Wilder jumped right back in and went for the kill. At the time the fight was called, one judge had Wilder ahead on the scorecards 39-37 while the two others had the contest
tied at 38-38.
“I just got a little impatient,” Washington told reporters after the loss. “I was trying to go for it. It was an even boxing match. I could have kept it like that and kept it boring. I don’t know why I fell asleep there. I guess I lost a little focus.”
Nevertheless, Washington called the match “an experience” and was sure he would learn from his first career championship opportunity.
“You have to follow the game plan and stay focused, stay patient,” Washington said. “You may not get all the shots you want in the beginning, but you have to play the game all the way out and then things will start to happen.”
Wilder retained his WBC belt with the victory and will now set his sights on becoming a unified champion in the heavyweight division. It’s unclear where Washington will go from here, having taken such a massive step up to face Wilder, but he tweeted a statement thanking fans on Monday morning, along with #ChampionOnTheRise.
“I’ll get back to work and come back stronger than ever,” Washington said. “This is a part of our sport, a part of life. You have to be able to get back up and keep pushing forward.”

Rachel Atherly | Daily Trojan
National Eating Disorders Awareness Week has arrived fresh on the heels of January diets and Valentine’s Day binges, telling us that “It’s Time To Talk About It” and filling our Twitter timelines with bland girl-power messages about loving ourselves, embracing our stretch marks and being “recovery warriors.”
I’m supposed to be your target demographic, National Eating Disorders Association, after a life-threatening case of anorexia and eight long years of struggles around food and my body. I’ve read all the recovery literature, talked to doctors, therapists and nutritionists for more hours than I’d care to think about, and am always willing to talk about my experiences with friends and peers. In short, I am the target demographic for this awareness week — the sort of person who is supposed to embrace the messaging around my mental illness and retweet it with reckless joy.
So why, then, am I so wary this week, especially at a time when up to 20 percent of college women and 7 percent of college men have eating disorders, and many more engage in unhealthy thinking and behaviors around food and weight? At a time when pressures to diet continue to increase and the standard of an attractive body becomes more and more unattainable, shouldn’t we revel in a week dedicated to contrary messages around body positivity and healthy relationships with food?
I’m sure that the organizers of NEDA Week have their hearts in the right place. There is no doubt that we as a society need to talk about our toxic collective attitudes toward food, diets and bodies, and designating a week to contemplate these issues is surely a step in the right direction. But all too often, the results of NEDA Week only serve to perpetuate stereotypes around eating disorders and alienate certain sufferers.
I want you to imagine someone who is suffering from an eating disorder. Is she white, skinny, middle class and starving herself? Now imagine someone who has recovered from an eating disorder. Is she still white, maybe slightly less skinny, still middle class, posting pictures of her former emaciated body side-by-side with her current one and calling it a recovery win?
Well, I hate to break it to you, but that’s not anywhere near a truthful view of people with eating disorders. In reality, 30 million people of all ages, races and genders suffer from eating disorders in the United States. One in four individuals with an eating disorder is male, and 16 percent of transgender college students reported having an eating disorder. The dangerous myth that eating disorders only affect white people has led to a lack of research and data on African American, Asian American, Hispanic and Native American communities. However, the little data that has been released reveals high levels of body dissatisfaction and dieting behavior. Thirteen percent of women over age 50 engage in eating disorder behaviors, and despite the prevailing narrative that sufferers are deathly thin, people of all body types are diagnosed.
Eating disorders also do not necessarily look like anorexia, restriction and attempts to lose weight. They also can manifest in bulimia — cycles of binging on food and purging through vomiting, fasting, laxative abuse or extreme exercise — or binge eating disorder, characterized by periods of out-of-control emotional eating. Other specified feeding of eating disorder was added to the fifth Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for all other abnormal, destructive eating patterns that are not covered by current diagnoses.
By creating a week of awareness and encouraging people to think about their relationships with food and get help if they need it, NEDA is doing a good thing. But all too often, this week is obscured by narratives that give a warped view of eating disorder sufferers and minimize the scary, hard work required in recovery.

My friends and I are currently training for a half-marathon in April. Our team name is a joke, but we’re definitely taking our training semi-seriously. Last week was the first time we ran more than five miles, and it’s the first time all year that I’ve felt a little apprehensive about running. 
I know that I can run five miles in any condition. Even if I forget to drink enough water or eat something prior, I still know that I’ll be able to finish with relatively little struggle. If I don’t have time to stretch afterward, I don’t sweat it because the soreness the next day would be minimal or even nonexistent. More than five miles, though, is an entirely different ball game.
No matter what distance the mental and physical hump may be for you, I’ve found the key to playing a different ball game: preparation. Sure, you’ll never know what running six miles feels like until you’ve done it, but it can feel a lot better with the right pre-game rituals.
In a perfect world with a well-planned and well-executed training schedule, runners would work up to the challenge by starting at a distance that they are comfortable at. One of the pieces of advice that I still remember from an old marathon teammate was, “If you can run one mile, you can run three miles. If you can run three miles, you can run five miles. If you can run five miles, you can run 10 miles. If you can run 10 miles, you can run a half-marathon. If you can run a half-marathon, you can run 20 miles. If you can run 20 miles, you can run a marathon. So if you can run one mile, you can run a marathon.” By adding on a little more mileage every week, longer distances become easier and even enjoyable.
The truth is that it’s not always that easy. I sleep in some days and don’t leave myself enough time to run. My running buddy goes out of town for the weekend, and I don’t add on the extra mile. Sometimes I sign up for races out of impulse and don’t give myself enough time to train for them. (I might be the only person whose impulse buys are 13.1-mile races.)
On those days that I know a long and arduous run is ahead of me, I do everything I can the day before to make the experience less painful. Mostly, that means drinking a lot of water. There’s nothing worse than trying to slog through a long run with cramps and a dry mouth and a nauseating feeling every time you put one foot in front of the other. Drinking water the day before makes all of the difference.
The weather is often a major factor in how I feel during my runs as well. I love just-under 60 degrees and cloudy weather. If it’s much colder than that, I’ll wear long leggings to run and spend about five miles of my six-mile run hating how overheated I am. If it’s hotter than that, the sun will tire me out much faster than my legs will. Lamenting about the weather is useless, but wearing the right gear or picking a shadier route can take the elements out of the equation.
If all else fails, I try to pinpoint exactly what is making me so miserable on my long runs. Is it the tension in my arms from holding them a little too tight? How long did it take for that side cramp to go away? Will slowing down my breathing help? Am I even physically tired or is it just my brain trying to undermine me? Finding the answers is enough motivation to keep going.
Long runs can be intimidating because it’s hard to know what to expect. I finished six miles last Sunday. To my surprise, though, it wasn’t too bad. I couldn’t remember what I was so worried about in the first place.

Though Mardi Gras isn’t what Los Angeles is known for, the city has conjured up Hollywood-worthy celebrations in past years. The celebratory, diverse  spirit of Los Angeles comes to life for this traditionally French-Creole-Catholic celebration. 
LySandra Vuong | Daily Trojan
Observed differently in cities across the country and internationally, Mardi Gras is most popularly celebrated during the three days before Ash Wednesday. Also referred to as “Fat Tuesday” or “Shrove Tuesday,” the festival is a time to indulge in “sinful” soul foods before Lent. Because of the city’s deeply rooted French history, New Orleans is the center of Mardi Gras celebrations in the United States, attracting about 1.4 million people annually. 
Los Angeles has borrowed New Orleans’ Southern charm to create some enviable Mardi Gras traditions of its own. Here are the best places in to don your purple and yellow beads.
1. Original Farmers Market
6333 W. 3rd St.
Los Angeles, CA 90036
For the last 28 years, the Original Farmers Market found in Mid-City has hosted an annual Mardi Gras parade. Stroll down the paths of the market with the tantalizing smells of gumbo, trumpets sounding jovially and beads being tossed around. Eddie Baytos & The Nervis Bros will be the star attraction on Fat Tuesday, playing from 6 to 9 p.m., and will be sure to bring the Southern spirit to the celebrations. 
2. Amoeba Music
6400 Sunset Blvd.
Los Angeles, CA 90028
This iconic Hollywood music store shifts from hipster to Cajun and Zydeco tunes for one night. A celebration complete with shimmery masks, decadent floats and of course, more purple and gold beads transform Sunset Boulevard into NOLA’s Bourbon Street. Bring your own noisemakers and horns to join in the festivities. 
3. The Little Jewel of New Orleans
207 Ord St.
Los Angeles, CA 90012
This holiday of decadence and gluttony wouldn’t be complete without the best Southern food in Los Angeles. Widely regarded as home of the best shrimp po’boy in the city, this Chinatown gem will not disappoint those looking for an authentic taste of New Orleans. The perfectly cooked, crispy shrimp is stuffed into a soft, sturdy bread roll and doused in mayonnaise. Crawfish macaroni and cheese, beignets and hush puppies round out the decadent menu.
4. Mardi Gras Masquerade Party
Downtown Santa Monica
For those looking for an elevated experience, Stage + Table, L.A.’s elite culinary club, is hosting a Masquerade Party on Mar. 11. Chef Kate H, a NOLA native, will concoct a classic Mardi Gras table with king cake, meat pies and gumbo included. The experience will include the essence of a New Orleans speakeasy, complete with several mixologists and mandatory masquerade masks for admission. 
5. Harold and Belle’s
2920 W. Jefferson Blvd.
Los Angeles, CA 90018
For a truly traditionally Southern dining experience, head over to Harold and Belle’s, the 40-year-old, family-owned Creole restaurant. Bursting with flavor of the seafood and sausage, its gumbo has been hailed as one of the best in Los Angeles by critics. The jambalaya, transporting diners to the bayou with the heat of the meat mixed with the tender shrimp, is another favorite. This comfort food joint has proven its worth in a city where NOLA natives complain that authentic dishes and Southern hospitality is rare. 
Whether it be eating Southern grub till, tossing sparkly beads or dancing to the tunes of the Cajun accordion, Los Angeles has borrowed the spirit of New Orleans to make Mardi Gras a festival to remember. Revel in the greasy, vibrant and colorful holiday — the more sparkles, noise and gold, the better.

The Chinese American Student Association hosted its 18th annual Chinese Culture Show at Bovard Auditorium on Sunday. The event was centered on a play titled I Am So Proud of You, with dance and musical performances interweaved throughout the night.
I Am So Proud of You aimed to capture some of the struggles of a Chinese American teenager living in the United States. CASA’s culture show was directed by Eddy Xing, a sophomore majoring in business administration, and Jefferson Yan, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences. The play’s protagonist is a rebellious 16-year-old Chinese American girl named Emily Lu, who learned to embrace her culture after being sent to stay with her grandfather.
Xing and Yan first came up with the idea for the play after noticing the underrepresentation of Chinese culture on campus.
“We wanted to introduce more Chinese American culture onto USC’s campus because there is a lack of understanding or lack of awareness for Chinese American culture,” Yan said. “As second-generation Chinese Americans, we face different issues that others don’t really face.”
In the beginning of the play, Emily is frustrated at her parents for not expressing their pride in her. Unsure of what to do with their only daughter, Emily’s parents send her to stay with her elderly grandfather — whom she had never met before — over her spring break.
 It is at her grandfather’s home that Emily learns about her family’s turbulent past and the sacrifices they made to give her a better life. At the end, Emily realizes that her parents have always been proud of her, and returns with a better understanding of her culture and family. Emily’s touching realization is reflective of the Asian American experience.
The play was not only captivating for the audience, but the production was also meaningful for the actors. Brendan Ma, a senior majoring in accounting, played the role of the grandfather in the play. Ma viewed it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 
“I’m definitely proud of all the hard work that everyone put into this play. There were few, if any, complaints even though we spent hours and hours doing this,” Ma said. “Everyone has midterms, everyone has other things going on, but we all blew it together and put on a good show.”
Along with the special production, the show also featured many talented Chinese American groups and performers on campus. 
Leo Xia, a senior majoring in industrial systems and engineering, is an Asian American musician who recently released his first EP, Hyphenated, which focuses on his identity. To relate to the coming-of-age theme of the play, Xia performed “Flame,” a song he wrote about his experiences of feeling helplessly trapped between two cultures, but never fully belonging to one. His message is similar to the play’s theme regarding Emily’s identity. Xia also performed “Yellow,” a song he wrote that was featured in a Buzzfeed video about the Chinese Massacre of 1871.
Trogons A Capella, an East Asian a capella group on campus, also performed at the show. The Trogons specialize in creating mashups of  popular English and Mandarin songs, showcasing each member’s ability to switch between two languages with ease. At the show, the group mixed a Disney medley with a Mandarin song about perseverance.
Chaotic 3 Hip Hop, a dance team on campus, also performed during the event.  The hip-hop team is a source of artistic expression for the members of CASA. Dancing to popular American songs, Chaotic 3’s performance provided an interesting contrast to the rest of the night. With this performance, the culture show captured both the Chinese and American sides of a Chinese American experience, sending the message that both cultures can coexist through a shared medium. 
CASA’s 18th annual culture not only reveal the various ways Chinese American students are involved in fine arts at USC, but also the wide spectrum of ways to express Chinese American culture. In the future, Xing and Yan hope that people gain a more comprehensive understanding of Chinese culture.
“People like to generalize Chinese culture into one big group, but then the reality is there’s a lot of facets in the culture, a lot of nuances, a lot of also unique situations that is in Chinese culture,” Yan said.

At the 89th Academy Awards last Sunday, drama rocked the ceremony’s final minutes: In a move that shocked millions, it was announced that Moonlight had won Best Picture, not La La Land. In a debacle with details still to come, the La La Land producers were mid-speech when headphone-wearing producers rushed the stage. The real winner was declared graciously by La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz, and the trophies were handed off to Moonlight producers Adele Romanski, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner. The air onstage was electric. Reality felt like a curtain drawn away.
Before Sunday night, I was fully, despondently prepared to write about the parallels between La La Land’s prescient victory and that of President Donald Trump last November. Now, I giddily change course. The victory of Barry Jenkins’ exquisite Moonlight feels right. It feels like the best thing to have happened in the past few months. At a time when hateful rhetoric and legislation seem to rain down without end, a film about a black gay man in Miami won the highest recognition through the most mainstream awards show there is. 
From the get-go, the battle for Best Picture between La La Land and Moonlight drew eerie parallels to the 2016 presidential election. If Trump was elected to the presidency on the woes of the white working class, the self-proclaimed “forgotten” underdogs, then it seemed also fitting that La La Land director Damien Chazelle marketed himself as someone who was looked down upon for his apparently brazen and experimental idea. Chazelle, it became clear over the course of awards season, liked to think of himself as a long-shot — someone who didn’t have a chance, fooling with the American Dream in the most prototypical of ways. 
But what he, like the Trump voter base, seemed to forget, was that the system was constructed to put them on top. A peddler of lost dreams and (white) nostalgia, Chazelle paraded himself as the creator of an art form audiences forgot, when the reality stands that the dream was always his. As Trump roared his promise to “Make America Great Again,” and as that slogan spread across the country, so, too, did La La Land promise its own brand of nostalgia for a past that favored white people. 
Though it is a stretch to label Chazelle as someone capitalizing on the false narrative of white victimhood, when you have attached to your project two of the biggest names in the industry and the knowledge that people love musicals and that Hollywood loves itself, the claim that you were anything but an easy sell is profoundly ignorant. 
Obviously, you can love La La Land without loving Donald Trump, and you can celebrate a movie for the simple reason that it fills your heart with joy. But I’m just calling it like it is, which is that the same political and systemic injustices that put Trump in power do not disappear when it comes to the silver screen. And we can ignore it, label art apolitical, indulge in the fantasy that movies serve us only as an “escape.” Or we can open our eyes and recognize the consequences of an art form that reaches billions. And those consequences are that movies — in all their glamour and glory — have taught us from the beginning how to act in real life, and that we depend on them more than we realize.
Moonlight won. And to say a phrase like that gives me goosebumps. That film was extraordinary. I have never seen a story told so elegantly in my entire life. Over the course of film history, a sprawling timeline that shamefully participated in blackface and The Birth of a Nation and yellow face and rape culture, Hollywood has finally given its crowning award to a film about a young, gay black man. Moreover, not one white person is featured in the work’s entirety. Mr. Chazelle, I implore you: Which film is the bigger miracle here?
It is strikingly symbolic and reactionary that the Academy, composed of filmmakers and businesspeople and icons, decided on Sunday that they will not retreat to an idealistic past that did not belong to everyone. That it is time not to look back but to look forward, time to place our bets in the future because that is what filmmaking has the power to change: the fabric of our society.
As much as we like to roll our eyes at how deeply Hollywood loves itself, movies also compose a great mirror in which America is forced to look itself in the eyes. And last Sunday, we looked in the mirror and saw a gay black boy staring back.
That is also America. That is us. 
As if the idea of diving into the film industry as an aspiring writer isn’t frightening enough, I have worried over and over about whether the stories I write are marketable or worth listening to. And a Moonlight win proved that wrong. I am never doubting myself or what I write about again. Your story will be moving and universal as long as it is truthful and well-told. You and your voice are worth an audience, no matter who you are.
Zoe Cheng is a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television. Her column, “Cross Section,” runs every other Tuesday.
What a viscerally rascist screed from another self-entitled, privileged idealist obsessed with identity politics and whose right to free speech ironically rests upon largely white forefathers whose progeny she so casually derides. Moonlight winning was just like election night: all the pundits predicted a La La Land win, but the upstart film ended up with the prize, just like Trump winning his unlikely and unpredicted presidency. 
Well, I hope at least the aspiring writer realizes Mr. Trump is America’s — and her — President!
You get goosebumps just saying Moonlight won, What are you snowflakes going to do when you get out in the real world ?
We’re living in the real world. You’re the one hunched over your computer calling people snowflakes all day. Go outside. The air is nice.
Emily… You don’t know it yet, but you’re not living in the real world.  You’re living in a world of “safe spaces” free  of “micro-aggressions”… where illegal immigrants get drivers licenses and in-state tuition, and are admitted to the State Bar …where women’s a gays’ rights are championed, unless they collide with Muslim beliefs on women and gays … and where lies about gender are peddled in an effort to coddle the .01% of human beings who suffer with gender confusion and identity issues.  I could go on.  There is nothing real about any of this rubbish.
