No. 1 women’s water polo remains undefeated after two victories over No. 2 Stanford this weekend. The group is now 14-0 on the season as the MPSF and NCAA tournaments loom on the horizon. 
“We’re very happy that we are still undefeated and that we won against Stanford, even though we don’t look at undefeated, we don’t look for the records,” head coach Marko Pintaric said. 
The two-game series began Saturday afternoon, with back-to-back scoring drives from both competitors leaving little room for breaks. The Cardinal started up 2-0 with a 5-meter penalty and a shot from the field, but USC answered with two in the first and a five-point surge in the second, turning the lead over to the Trojans for good. Redshirt senior goalie Holly Parker kept the energy going for USC, putting Stanford’s chances of a tie to rest with a huge 5-meter penalty save. 
Redshirt senior driver Denise Mammolito hit a hat trick in the second half, moving to the No. 12 spot on USC’s all-time career scoring rankings. With assists from junior driver Grace Tehaney, redshirt senior utility Maud Megens was able to match Mammolito’s hat trick to put the Trojans up 12-7 with just under four minutes to go. Stanford would only manage one more goal to bring the final score to 12-8 at the end of regulation.
Sunday afternoon’s game was a much more tense affair, though it started with all smiles from Mammolito and Stanford senior driver Sarah Klass as they met with referees to start gameplay. With USC fans unable to attend in the Uytengsu Aquatics Center, they took to the roof of the Jefferson Parking structure, adding to the cheers from the teams that filled the lately quiet swim stadium.  
“It’s really hard to manage the shift and emotions and to come the next day and play consistent and win,” Pintaric said.
It was the seniors that pulled the Trojans through to the end, with senior driver Verica Bakoc dominating the first half with a hat trick of nearly impossible shots to keep the Trojans level. Tied 5-5 at the half, the hard press from both teams put their conditioning and endurance to the test. 
USC trailed at several points in the second half, but Mammolito came in clutch to close the deficit each time. Most of her shots came from the wings as the Trojans were unable to match Stanford’s success in converting post-up opportunities. 
“The focus in defense was to prevent exactly that [post-ups]. In the second game they were more successful, obviously,” Pintaric said. “So we did have to make some adjustments at the half, addressing the matchups and stress the importance of timing in defense when somebody is posted up and you know how to jump in right away into a drop.”
But the defensive energy didn’t falter, with Parker heading up to 12 saves by the time the teams trickled into overtime — a cause of no teams finding a winner from a 10-10 tie for the last 3:15 of the game. At this point, all five or so of the attendees in the stadium absolutely could not sit down or stay still. 
It was the Trojans’ tenacity — and maybe Daddy Yankee’s “Gasolina” playing before overtime helped as well — that brought them through to the finish. 
Stanford would use one of its timeouts in the first overtime period to set up for a new position, only for Tehaney to steal the ball three seconds into the drive, getting the Trojans their first lead in two periods. Redshirt senior driver Kelsey McIntosh passed over to Mammolito for the latter’s career-high seventh goal of the game, securing a lead that would not be lost. The Cardinal managed to slip one in with less than two seconds left in the second overtime period, and even threw redshirt senior goalie Emalia Eichelberger in for a last-second field advantage, but it was no use as the Trojans escaped with a 12-11 win.  
Next weekend, USC will host No. 5 Arizona State for two games at 11 a.m. Saturday and Sunday, the Trojans’ last home game series of their season. 
“It’s going to be challenging weekend, so we are doing our scouting, we’re doing our game preparation to address the minor adjustments from previous games, and to adapt them to Arizona and to go to attempt to win these games, and we understand how hard this is going to be,” Pintaric said.

USC won 6-5 Sunday to complete a clean sweep of the Dixie State Trailblazers at Dedeaux Field. The wins have continued a turnaround after a rough 3-6 start for the Trojans. They now sit at 15-11 overall with a 5-4 record in conference play, putting them at sixth in the Pac-12. 
In the series opener Friday, the Trojans dominated, logging season highs in both runs and hits. The Trojans started the game hot, and Dixie State had no answer. In the first two innings, USC scored nine runs. Junior infielder Ben Ramirez hit a three-run home run in the bottom of the first, and sophomore first baseman Clay Owens followed with one of his own shortly after. 
Dixie State struggled to respond, scoring just one run on a single from sophomore outfielder Ben Petty-Hull in the seventh inning. In the same inning, the Trojans scored four of their own, ending with redshirt junior outfielder Bart West scoring on a flyout. 
The resounding 14-1 win in Friday’s series opener was a genuine team effort, with RBI’s coming from eight different players. 
On the defensive side, junior pitcher Isaac Esqueda had a great day at the mound, setting the tone by holding the Trailblazers scoreless in his six innings pitched. Esqueda has had a fantastic season, and is 4-1 on the year with a 1.99 earned run average, eighth in the entire Pac-12. 
On Saturday, the Trojans continued their success at the plate, scoring seven runs in the first two innings. Redshirt junior outfielder Jamal O’Guinn set the tone in this one with a three-run homer in the first after Ramirez did the same on Friday. 
Sophomore first baseman Clay Owens and sophomore infielder Tyler Lozano also hit home runs in the third and fourth innings, respectively. Owens’ homer brought in Ramirez, who scored his third run of the game to extend USC’s lead to 10-0. 
Freshman first baseman Chase Rodriguez’s two-RBI double for Dixie State in the seventh inning was the first response to the Trojans’ barrage of scoring all day. However, it was not enough to stop USC, who solidified the series win on Saturday, winning by a score of 10-3.
“I thought we executed well,” head coach Jason Gill said. “We got on base, we moved guys over, we situationally hit really well.” 
After two blowout wins, only one win stood between the Trojans and a series sweep. 
The game Sunday would prove to be more of a challenge for Ramirez and company. USC went down 1-0 after a wild pitch from sophomore starting pitcher Alex Cornwell. Ramirez immediately responded with a game-tying solo homer. 
After freshman infielder Shane Taylor’s RBI for Dixie State and O’Guinn’s for the Trojans, the game stood at 2-2 going into the sixth inning. 
“It starts on the mound in Alex Cornwell, and our defense played really well behind Alex,” Gill said. 
Cornwell’s pitching in this game and the entire USC defense prevented Dixie State from breaking away even after a slow start at the plate for the Trojans. 
Finally, the Trojans started rolling with four runs in the sixth frame. A two-run homer by O’Guinn led to two of the runs. O’Guinn is leading the team in RBI’s this season with 29.
The end of the game was not a breeze. Dixie State returned with a vengeance and scored in the eighth and ninth innings, putting the score at 5-6. The Trojans were able to hold the Trailblazers off to complete the sweep, but it was a nerve-racking ending. 
When asked about the close ending, Gill responded, “We are just going to prepare, go to work, and look at the video and see if there’s anything we can tweak.” 
The Trojans must be at their best heading into their game against Fresno State on Tuesday, followed by a crucial series against a Pac-12 opponent in Oregon this weekend. The first pitch between USC and Fresno State is at 6 p.m.

USC announced Monday that approximately 5,000 fans can attend this Saturday’s football Spring Showcase at the Coliseum. Other outdoor spring sports events will be open to a limited number of family members and guests of student-athletes and coaches starting Tuesday.
The announcement comes a week after Los Angeles County moved into the orange tier of coronavirus restrictions for business and activity opening, which loosens restrictions that previously prevented guests from attending USC’s athletic events. To comply with the updated state public health guidelines, football spectators must be California residents and the stadium seating will block off six or fewer seats for each individual group. The statement says attendees “will be required to attest that they reside in the state” and “that their pod is comprised only of members of a single household or audience group.” Audience groups are capped at six individuals from a maximum of three different households. Masks will be required at all times except when actively eating or drinking.
The Showcase is the only USC Athletics event open to the general public this spring and the first football event open to the public in more than a year. Football last played in front of fans in December 2019 at the Holiday Bowl, with its last true home game taking place in November 2019. Last October, parents of football players petitioned to allow families at the Pac-12 games for the shortened 2020 season. While fans were allowed at some Pac-12 football games, teams in California were required to play with no fans in attendance due to safety protocols. 
Football season ticket holders are first in line to purchase tickets. While baseball has more than a dozen games at Dedeaux field scheduled, the attendance remains limited to related parties. Other outdoor spring sports with home games left to play that will allow guests and family members include women’s soccer, men’s tennis, women’s water polo and women’s lacrosse.
The University will communicate with coaches and players directly about the process of allocating their guest tickets.

Everyone has that album that defined their childhood. Across the world, massive albums such as The Beatles’ “Abbey Road” or Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” are often cited as pieces of work that revolutionized not only the music industry, but entire generations of music-lovers as well.
However, if you grew up in the 2000s, one of the most unavoidably generation-defining albums was Taylor Swift’s “Fearless.” Released in 2008 with instant hits including “Love Story” and “You Belong With Me,” “Fearless” was an album that spoke to people everywhere. Whether the world liked it or not, this 18-year-old blonde girl from Tennessee and her mastermind abilities to capture teenage emotion through songwriting was about to take the world by storm. 
Since then, Swift’s impact on the music industry has been undeniably astronomical. From consistently massive albums since the release of “Fearless,” she’s effectively raised a generation of storytellers who are inspired by her ingenious music composition, master-class lyricism and, most of all, complete emotional vulnerability. But amid media scrutinization, mass misogyny and, most recently, the hostage situation of her first six albums, Swift and her music have had to survive through some of the most brutal situations the music industry has to offer.
Nonetheless, in her rereleased 26-track version “Fearless (Taylor’s Version),” Swift masterfully reclaims her narrative and demonstrates that she hasn’t just navigated the music industry — she’s absolutely redefined it.
We’ll start with the most notable difference: Swift’s voice has significantly changed since 2008. While this could have risked the original integrity of the album, she actually uses this evolution to her benefit in many tracks. Her once-prominent country twang and nasal vowel pronunciation is noticeably lost, now replaced by a smoother, warmer, deeper, more controlled tone.
This improvement is particularly applaudable in slower, emotional songs such as “White Horse,” “Breathe,” “Untouchable” and “The Best Day.” With tracks like these that require her vocals and lyrics to shine, her new vocal techniques create a tender, blended, intimate ambiance that allows the listener to fully absorb the gravity of her lyrics. If the originals themselves weren’t already soul-stirring, one could say these new versions have taken significant strides to reach further into the hearts of the listeners.
Her new voice’s impact also extends beyond her intimate ballads. In upbeat songs such as “Hey Stephen” and “You Belong With Me,” Swift further demonstrates her improved stylistic and vocal control from years of experience. This is particularly evident in the little details — the edgier, pronounced humming in “Hey Stephen,” the playful hints of a country accent in “Tell Me Why,” the mischievous smirk she had while recording “The Way I Loved You,” her enthusiastic grunts of “huh!” across multiple songs (a vocal quip trademarked to this era).
Listening closely, you can tell she’s putting significant care into honoring these songs by accessing her teenage emotions while recording them and blending it seamlessly with her current musical expertise. She recaptures the original emotion perfectly: While I’m listening to her newfound vocal confidence in the “Fearless” title track, I still get the same heart-fluttering feeling I had listening to the original at 8 years old. It’s a beautiful and almost biblical approach to this project.
Nonetheless, the storytelling elements of this album have and forever will continue to shine through as Swift’s major musical strength. Whether it’s resurfacing her heartbreak with Joe Jonas through “Mr. Perfectly Fine” and “Forever & Always” (I also highly recommend the piano version for a more intimate perspective) or giving advice to her wide-eyed, naive freshman year self with “Fifteen,” Swift’s ability to transport you to specific, personal moments reveals something of humanity as a whole: how connected we all are through shared struggles and experiences. It’s more evident than ever that her music is absolutely timeless for this reason.
Fans of her original album will also notice subtle instrumental changes to original tracks as well. Whether she’s fully building out the instrumentals and harmonies in “You Belong With Me” or adding more strings to pick up momentum by the second chorus of “Untouchable,” Swift has managed to maintain the integrity of the original songs while adding her own finishing touches. It’s these key subtle changes that speak so truthfully to Swift’s sonic evolution and authority over the years, as she’s exercising these songs with more tools she’s picked up from experience.
The other significant difference is the six new “From The Vault” tracks, as she lovingly puts it, that have been released with Taylor’s version of Fearless. Written circa-2008, Swift further demonstrates that she’s in full control of her music by not only giving her fans new music, but also re-imagining these songs in a style that simultaneously pays homage to her country roots and adds hints of her modern “folklore”/“evermore” sonic composition.
This “folklore”/“evermore” inspiration was particularly evident in “Don’t You,” a track that describes the one-sided pain of running into an ex who’s doing fine, with flute-esque chords fluttering in tangent with her breathy background vocals, as if she’s catching her breath in the relationship. On the other hand, tracks such as country duet “That’s When,” featuring Keith Urban, bitter yet upbeat anthem “Mr. Perfectly Fine,” and mandolin-strumming heartbreak ballad “You All Over Me,” featuring Maren Morris, sound like they were mixed in the style 2008 Taylor would have wanted. 
Of particular note is her incredibly compelling lyricism in “You All Over Me” and “Bye Bye Baby.” With lyrics like “But like the dollar in your pocket, it’s been spent and traded in / You can’t change where it’s been, reminds me of me” and “Then the here and the now floods in / Feels like I’m becoming a part of your past,” it feels almost criminal that these songs were left out of the original album. But if anything now, it speaks to how genius Swift has always been in articulating the emotion of love and heartbreak — even only as a teenager.
There are millions of words that can be written about the impact of Taylor Swift. It would be an understatement to call her a force of the music industry, or a mastermind storyteller or even a big sister you never had. She’s more than the blonde Tennessee teenager that performed entire sold-out stadium tours, and she’s more than the words on my lyric booklet as I sat in front of the CD player at 8 years old, absorbing every word of “You Belong With Me.”
 While there can be millions of words written about the impact of Taylor Swift, the release of “Fearless (Taylor’s Version)” has made it more clear than ever: The only words that will define her legacy are her own.
And I cannot wait to see what she’ll say next.

It doesn’t take long for meme storms to form. During the storming of the Capitol, social media platforms were inundated with burlesque renditions of phoney vikings and confused ‘patriots’ carrying Georgian (the country) flags. When an Evergreen container ship blocked the Suez Canal, photos of the vast bulk of the hull being excavated by a lone feeble-looking digger took over the internet. President Joe Biden was also quickly photoshopped by these meme lords onto an Easy Climber stair lift when he tripped climbing the stairs to (Ch)Air Force One.
Though most people get into the meme wave for a quick gag, these moments of virality have caused a paradigm shift in politics. An increasing number of world leaders are posting and producing memes, or following satirical accounts on social media which offer political memes. For example, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton famously attempted to engage young voters with a meme that said “How does your student debt make you feel? Reply in three emojis or less.” Accordingly, memes have entered the political vernacular, and this is beneficial to our democracy.
Meme warfare brings the discourse back to the people. These silly photos are inherently participatory; everybody can be a creator and everybody can be a sharer. Furthermore, the storm effect carries an intrinsic sense of belonging to a group because people want to be part of the inside joke. The keyboard warriors are creating a more inclusive political environment because everyone feels welcome to criticize and satirize world events. In other words, memes are engaging a whole new portion of the population in civic discourse.
Memes also present an opportunity for unbiased media production. In a political environment plagued by lobbying and interest groups — where a $1 campaign contribution results in a $6.65 less state corporate tax, every piece of information is biased in some way. Memes, instead, are candid political expressions. They are not funded by any party (most of the time) and provide honest opinions. For Americans, they are a breath of fresh air from the constant barrage of propaganda.
There is a caveat however. While memes do champion discourse and engagement, they can easily be manipulated to support campaigns of disinformation. The weaponization of memes through mass replication has created a powerful tool for waging political war against opponents. This has even culminated in the creation of troll factories, whose sole goal is to disseminate content which is meant to appear genuine; during the 2016 election, Russian trolls spread 10.4 million tweets, 1,100 YouTube videos, 116,000 Instagram posts and 61,500 Facebook posts to build former President Donald Trump’s reputation. 
Yet, with regulation, this issue can be easily abated. There has already been a crackdown on fake accounts. Between May and June 2018, Twitter suspended more than 70 million accounts. In December 2020, Facebook removed more than 2,000 fake posts that contained malicious information. Instagram even introduced a new fact-checking tool, that allows users to flag disreputable posts. With a more coordinated effort between the social media conglomerates and the government, the number of trolls may be even further reduced.
Hence, we should be encouraging the proliferation of these satirical parodies. Instead of labelling the internet’s lingua franca as infantile, we should begin to champion this new form of expression. In some ways, memes are the new political cartoon. 
So, just as political caricatures are considered legitimate commentaries on global affairs, memes should be promoted in political discourse. Whether this be through mentions as evidence in public speeches and debates, or even published in media communications, the time has come for the memeification of democracy.

It wasn’t long ago when the term “anti-racism” was on the tip of every avowed liberals’ tongues (I specify “liberals” here because it has since become painfully apparent how averse a sizable portion of the country is to ideas such as anti-racism). An explanation for the term’s sudden but sustained ascendance shouldn’t be necessary, but for the purpose of establishing context, I’ll elaborate. 
Following the murder of George Floyd in May and during the months of protests, uprisings and intellectual and cultural shifts that ensued, common knowledge and usage of the term “anti-racism” increased exponentially. The term wasn’t new, but it powerfully encapsulated the ethos of the moment and offered many Americans a new framework through which to evaluate their own beliefs and behaviors. It wasn’t enough to simply not be racist — not being racist amounted to tacit complicity with racism — now, the expectation for baseline decency was to actively fight against racism in all of its forms; in other words, to be anti-racist. 
With this traction also came traction in popular literary and reading circles. Book stores became inundated with orders and requests for anti-racist reading material. Self-proclaimed anti-racist book clubs proliferated across the country. Posts about purchasing, reading and, in some cases, merely owning anti-racist books became commonplace on many people’s social media feeds. In addition, anti-racist reading lists became a fixture on social media and in nearly every major media publication.
So, it is with this in mind that I feel compelled to ask, as videos of violent hate crimes and racist bile threatening Asian Americans becomes a daily norm, “Where have all the anti-racist reading lists gone?”
Of course, this isn’t to equate the experience of Black Americans in the United States with the experience of Asian Americans. Comparisons between marginalized groups are often unproductive and prone to reducing racial trauma to a competitive sport. However, if the purpose of anti-racist reading lists and their curators — major news publications, magazines, bookstores, public figures and social media activists — really is to combat racism in all of its forms, it stands to reason that a wave of anti-racist reading lists on anti-Asian American hate should’ve proliferated by now. 
This also isn’t to suggest that these lists don’t exist at all. A simple Google search would result in several applicable reading lists on the issue, but this misconstrues the point. What I’m trying to draw attention to is a lack of urgency and frequency. Simply put, my feed is not being flooded with anti-racist reading lists as it was last summer. I don’t see anyone displaying stacks of anti-racist books by Asian American authors or bringing attention to Asian American literature, even though everyone and their mother was woefully desperate to parade around their copies of “White Fragility” and “How to be an Antiracist.”  
All of this has brought me to a simple conclusion, one that I’ve understood for most of my life: The United States still does not care about Asian Americans. 
I recognize that some might take issue with this. Anti-racist reading lists and social media posts about them are not necessarily representative. In the same vein, the potentially superficial and performative nature of the various forms of anti-racist activism described above are well documented. Large amounts of those previously mentioned anti-racist reading orders were canceled or never picked up from bookstores. It also goes without saying that it is more than likely that many of those who posted about their newly acquired anti-racist libraries never got to the more substantive work of reading. 
At the end of the day, the form of activism I’ve alluded to is almost entirely performative. I’m almost certain that last summer’s anti-racist reading lists didn’t save or substantially improve any Black lives, and I’m similarly certain that they wouldn’t be saving or substantially improving any Asian American lives today. Anti-racist reading lists, and even the books contained within them, can be useful and extraordinary things, but none of them are magical cure alls for our collective ignorance, biases and prejudices. 
Still, even performative activism is better than no activism; and performative activism still contributes to elevating long-overlooked injustices and indignities to mainstream, common acceptance. It also can engender broader recognition that a problem exists. 
So, as I continue to see people that look like me, my mother and my grandparents attacked, brutalized and harassed seemingly every day, even if the activism is all performative, the performance, at a bare minimum, would be appreciated right now.

As students at a competitive college, all USC students may have felt the pressures of grind culture, or a performative workaholism that measures people by productivity. This culture is perpetrated by competing hours worked, hours slept or units per semester. It is not uncommon to hear students compare the number of hours slept, wearing their all-nighters as badges of honor. 
This grind culture sweeps into all communities, making it impossible to avoid. It’s in Nike’s new slogan, “Rise. Grind. Shine. Again,” social media hashtags and LinkedIn updates. Grind culture is inescapable at USC — no matter who you are, what your major is or where you’re from, everyone is affected by this toxic trend. 
Grind culture is especially easy to fall into, since it is disguised as a self-improvement movement. Many mistake working hard with caring for oneself. When students take a break from school, they are often accused of being lazy. People who do not participate in grind culture are not seen as simply choosing a different lifestyle decision but as physically and mentally weak — refusing to work on themselves. Peers often think productivity is analogous to self-improvement. This peer pressure makes it almost impossible to not participate in the movement. 
The siren song of grind culture sucks people into dangerous patterns. Although there may be some superficial benefits of the movement — such as increased productivity — there are deeper, much more serious consequences. Basing self-worth on superficial measures of work leads to major mental complications.
The very idea of grind culture is extremely detrimental to mental health. When comparing oneself against others, it’s painful to see how there will always be smarter, better and more successful people. Students often place so much stress on themselves since they feel like they have to keep up with the rest of their classmates. To compensate, they will often work for hours upon hours on schoolwork. This constant stress and degradation can make people feel unworthy and tired.  
People who participate in grind culture often suffer from mental health conditions. Common mental health issues include depression, perfectionism and anxiety. When one bases oneself on surface-level comparisons of productivity, self-esteem becomes extremely fragile. Students will go too hard on themselves for failing to be productive, leading to self-esteem problems. 
On a physical sense, grind culture leads to toxic work patterns and exhaustion. Many people work more than 12 hours a day, slaving away at homework, studying, exercising and working. After months or even years of this extreme schedule, students may develop health issues. Grind culture takes a physical toll on those who participate, tearing them down to the bone.
Valuing oneself and others on productivity ruins the organic relationships and appreciation people should have for each other. As people, there are so many, much more meaningful metrics to base self-worth on. Dwindling down individuals to simple metrics dehumanizes people. When students compare others, it should never be about how little someone sleeps or how many units someone takes; it should be about more personal, important qualities. 
Instead of using productivity as a metric, students should learn to prioritize healthier alternatives. Learning and working should be about personal, organic growth, not harmful competition. Instead of comparing hours worked or units taken, people should focus on real measures of humanity. Students need to realize their identity is much more than their productivity. 
Students at USC should not participate in such an unhealthy movement. Instead, the school and its students should learn to foster a more person-centered way of growing. The current peer pressure and social expectations need to change.

When then-high school student Isha Sanghvi saw that her younger brother’s public elementary school did not offer a hands-on, engaging science curriculum, she became concerned about the future of his education. Due to the large age difference between her brother and her, she considers herself to be a third parent to him. When going over his assignments, she noticed that her brother’s science courses mainly centered around coloring worksheets and cardboard robot projects. 
Although Sanghvi lived in an affluent neighborhood in the Bay Area, there were few opportunities for students in the public school system to receive a quality science education.
In 2016, she began investigating what equitable science opportunities would be available to less advantaged communities and realized that most high-quality science programs were expensive, and students would miss out on learning opportunities. 
Additionally, Sanghvi said she came to understand that current science curriculums offered do not connect science to students’ lives and rather focus on reaching learning benchmarks and end-of-the-year goals. As a result, Sanghvi and her friends decided to create an afterschool program at her brother’s elementary school called Stemnova. 
Stemnova, a grassroots STEM education nonprofit, quickly became sought after by many parents in her hometown, with the city of Fremont contacting her and asking if the program could be brought to more schools. Stemnova then expanded to assist family shelters and shelters for those experiencing homelessness and two years later hosted a 650 student hands-on learning STEM competition at the team’s local high school.
“[The event] was the culmination of being able to really see that we could become a nonprofit just because we have never really seen ourselves as anything bigger than like a local organization,” said Sanghvi, a sophomore studying neuroscience. “Seeing that need and seeing students from all over California attend something like this, made us realize that [Stemnova] could grow a lot bigger than what we originally envisioned it to be.”
While the Stemnova team began teaching in 2016, it was formally established in 2017 as a 501(C)3 organization. However, when Sanghvi’s team members went to college and began attending different universities such as University of Pennsylvania and UCLA, Stemnova halted operations in 2019. In March 2020, the team became more educated on educational inequalities accentuated due to the coronavirus pandemic, and Stemnova restarted in a virtual setting. 
“[My team members and I were] really just itching to do something when [the coronavirus] hit because we felt so helpless and so paralyzed by everything that was going on,” Sanghvi said. “We were like if there’s anything we can do to help we would want to do it.”
Sanghvi said that after doing a deeper dive into education inequity, her team spoke to community educators and other educational professionals and decided to focus on middle school students. 
“We’ve noticed that, for the most part, middle school is a turning point for most students where they’re at that age where they can really absorb and understand science but also at that age [when] bad experiences might turn them away from pursuing things in high school and higher education,” Sanghvi said. 
The team ran recruitment in August, and students from all around the country joined the team, including seven USC students. After recruiting a larger team, the Stemnova education team worked on creating a science curriculum that could be replicable throughout the country. To do this, Stemnova decided to pilot a virtual climate change and urban sustainability program at three middle schools, two in Los Angeles and one in Philadelphia. 
Stemnova has two components that make up its mission. One component is creating engaging science curriculums and afterschool STEM programs relevant to the community and intersectional to social justice.
“We’re really interested in finding ways to make the most engaging and equitable kind of curriculums and programs around STEM that are really afterschool and hands-on learning,” Sanghvi said. “Oftentimes, science curriculum or science programming is either not free or [has] high costs which is one of the biggest barriers to access, or it’s just not engaging and doesn’t really allow students to fully understand science from a hands-on way, which means that they’re just not very likely to pursue it in the long term.”
Various Stemnova team members noticed that many well-meaning STEM non-profit programs create a curriculum and enter communities without knowing the context, culture and background of the communities. In response to this need, the Stemnova team created the second component, the Chapter Leader Program. 
This program creates community involvement by training local leaders to teach students in their own communities. Stemnova meets with the Chapter Leaders every couple of weeks to teach them how to be effective educators, how to establish good leadership skills and how to teach young students in engaging ways. 
Sana Shah, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention and an education director at Stemnova, said she joined the Stemnova team in August because she loves working with students but had never been able to tie her passion for STEM with the empowerment of other students, especially students of color.
Shah’s education team’s main role is ideating what the topic of the year will be. This semester, the pilot program focus is on virtual urban sustainability and climate change. 
Her team also develops every aspect of the curriculum by making powerpoint presentations and project based learning opportunities. Shah’s goal is to ensure that, in the future, people who are not part of the education team can also teach by looking at the curriculum guide and teaching the class.
“We’re not only teaching students about climate change and sustainability through our program, but we’re also exposing them to a future in the field,” Shah said. “We’re making sure that students have a long term interest and investment in the curriculum that might help them in high school and college and beyond.”
Laya Madulapally, a sophomore majoring in computer science, is a tech director at Stemnova whose team worked alongside the education team to develop a sustainable city model for climate change curriculum using SketchUp, a 3D modeling computer program.
Madulapally was in charge of creating a climate change tracker website, so students could enter the amount of energy items, waste management items and transportation items they could invest in to make their city greener. 
“I thought that was really interesting [to join the team] because their mission was really powerful to me,” Madulapally said. “The idea of providing some education to underserved communities, As someone in STEM myself from a minority, being a woman and being Asian, it’s really important for me that I’m able to spread the mission of STEM, being able to get students interested in engineering and science.”
Madulapally thinks the pilot program and curriculum is going well despite the challenges of shifting the curriculum online. Teaching the students and holding the lessons has been successful and the tech team is currently working on developing a soli tech curriculum and coding curriculum and are hoping to pilot it in the fall, she said. 
Outreach director Shivani Daftary and her team took on the role of contacting schools and determining the partnerships with the three selected middle schools for the pilot program in December. In February, the pilot program began and has been successful so far with two schools meeting once a week with Stemnova and one school meeting twice a week. 
“It started off with reaching out to different schools and organizations to pilot our educational curriculum,” said Daftary, a senior studying human biology. “That took a lot of sending out cold emails and scheduling calls, a lot of preliminary interviews to see what an organization was about, whether we could or couldn’t support them.” 
Sanghvi’s long term goal from Stemnova is to create more equitable learning opportunities within the public school education system, by creating a curriculum that can be integrated directly within classrooms. Currently, a lot of Stemnova’s programming is afterschool-based and not everyone can be a part of after school activities. Stemnova also strives to create as many community-based chapters as possible and believes there is an infinite model of growth in grassroots learning within program. 
“We always ask students to journal like, ‘Why does science even matter?’ ‘Do you consider yourself a scientist?’ — really asking them to engage with their own identity in science and really reconcile the fact that each and every one of us are scientists,” Sanghvi said. “I think that biggest click and that biggest change in the mentality in which students learn is the biggest thing that makes them convinced to follow science in higher education.”

When people ask me how I became a sports editor, I always say I kind of fell into the role. I checked the sports section box on my Daily Trojan application thinking nothing of it — a week later I was scrambling to follow a golf scorecard for a recap due in less than 72 hours. The section was never a place I thought I could lead, but here I am.
I’m no sports encyclopedia, but I grew up in a sports family. SportsCenter was on loop for hours at a time in my living room, and we never missed a chance to see our hometown Royals or Chiefs play. I’ll never forget the collective excitement of my city transforming from a fly-over spot on the map to world champions both in the World Series and the Super Bowl. 
We feel such personal pride in the athletes most of us will never meet, and I’ve found that phenomena holds no geographic barriers. It’s something I still love to witness and write about at USC, but I’d be lying if I said I don’t feel like a fraud every time I do. I’m writing this attempting to contextualize such a feeling. 
Sports media holds no tangible barrier of entry for me, yet a presence of subtle exclusion remains. It’s there when I am one of only a handful of women in a packed press box. It’s there where I see the countless suits on the countless pregame and halftime shows. It’s there when I see the abysmal numbers of women across all newspaper sports sections in the country. 
The University of Central Florida’s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport releases a bi-annual study tracking the makeup of newspapers’ sports section leadership across the country. Their most recent publication in 2018 gave an overall grade of D+ for racial and gender equity in hiring practices. 
Women only make up 10% of this country’s sports editors. Looking at this study’s record, that trend hasn’t improved in its decade of coverage. The people setting the story agenda for local sports happenings are still overwhelmingly male, and overwhelmingly white. 
When I first started looking into the problem of diversity in sports media, that number seemed incredibly off to me — at least through my lens as an ESPN consumer. But that makes sense with ESPN being the, if not only, sports outlet with improved hiring practices under the leadership of former network President John Skipper. 
Under his reign, diversity became a prerogative both on and off camera. The outlet, seen as the mecca for all sports reporting, accounted for the largest totals of women and people of color who are sports editors, assistant editors and writers. In a way, ESPN has a near monopoly when it comes to diverse voices within this sector of media. 
It’s not a bad thing — if anything I’m happy the authority on sports has a production team that strives to reflect its audiences. But we have to remember that this sports media powerhouse is far from perfect when it comes to supporting said diverse voices. 
From my vantage point the watershed moment exposing the network’s actual treatment of its staffers was Jemele Hill’s departure in 2018. 
Hill, a sports reporter and on-air talent for 12 years at ESPN, was suspended for calling out Jerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys owner, on Twitter for his McCarthian stance on national anthem protests in 2017. She has repeatedly stated that the network’s hesitancy to enter itself into “political” discussions wasn’t the whole reason behind her leaving, but the tension within her workplace suffocated her individuality in reporting. 
“You give up a lot of your creative freedom, your autonomy,” said Hill on the Sports Illustrated Media Podcast in 2020. 
Last year proved that even the most powerful sports media outlet couldn’t separate itself from politics anymore, but it still saddens me that it took such a societal-shifting event like the murder of George Floyd for the network to readdress its identity-erasing practice.
Diversity in a newspaper section cannot serve as a PR bragging point, and the corporate obsession to appear inclusive takes away from the actual work needed to support and uplift different voices. Writers, editors and producers alike can’t just be shoved into a mold of what has been done — people need space to innovate content, to make it more inclusive and representative. 
The identity of who sets the sports media agenda directly dictates what gets covered — and the lack of diversity with local sports outlets means a lack of perspectives for specific sports markets. 
Take Los Angeles. The editors of the Los Angeles Times sports section are almost exclusively white men, save Deputy Sports Editor Iliana Limón Romero. For such a major market with sports fans of all different backgrounds, this is a snapshot of how whitewashed sports coverage can become for a certain area. 
At the Daily Trojan, we are not excluded from this dilemma on representative reporting staffs. While our sports section is 30% women, we still miss the mark ensuring our coverage is inclusive and reflective of the diversity within USC Athletics. 
In our letter from the editor last semester, we acknowledged our historical fault with insular sports reporting, but I can’t write this column confident that we’ve followed through with the solutions promised.
I can criticize the coldness I feel from this sports market for not being an expert in sports, but I also must acknowledge the privilege from barriers journalists of color must face while trying to bring a new perspective. That effort has to be more than just writing this column or reading a sports media diversity study, it has to be followed through in actively uplifting voices of color, both in my section and within USC Athletics.
We may be “just” a student-run paper, but I believe we have the reach of a local outlet, connecting to communities both on and off campus. Our practices and priorities, when it comes to diversity, ultimately reflect the broader media environment. If we, as student journalists, don’t reflect on our paper’s representation, how can we criticize the media giants we aspire to be a part of?
To push the envelope, we have to scrutinize both ESPN and local outlets and acknowledge the space Black and Indigenous people and people of color and women journalists are making for themselves. Hill now writes incredible pieces for The Atlantic and produces her own podcast, “Jemele Hill is Unbothered.” Romero is a part of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists Task Force, creating networks for journalists of Hispanic descent to connect. 
The peaks of the sports media mountain can be goals to reach, but if we’re going to fix the diversity reporting problem we have to expand our reporting and coverage to different perspectives.

USC men’s tennis came up short in their bout to beat Stanford Saturday. 
 A win would have extended their season record over the Cardinal to 2-0 heading into Pac-12 Championship play. Instead, a frantic set of tiebreaks and runaway points led to their demise and an even book at 1-1.
 The Trojans came into this match off a three game win streak and a previous victory over Stanford just three weeks ago with their top players heading the lineup. 
 Early on, things looked like they were working.  Redshirt senior’s Riley Smith and Daniel Cukierman — the No. 2 doubles pair in the country — swept Stanford’s pair of sophomore Neel Rajesh and senior Axel Geller in a 6-1 set. The Cardinal couldn’t keep pace with the returns, especially those coming off of Smith’s racquet, which led them to a sole hold of serve.
 Smith and Cukierman’s win was echoed by a more drawn-out 7-5 victory from sophomore Stefan Dostanic and junior Bradley Frye. The duo, putting away the set, clinched the doubles point for the Trojans — a crucial advantage in college tennis.
 “Bradley and Stef have done a great job as well, and they hung in there and won good points at the right moment and had a solid overall effort,” head coach Brett Masi said. “Solid doubles playing.”
 A fierce start and a point ahead, USC needed three singles wins to walk away as victor.  They came up with only two.
 All but one match went into three sets, the lone two setter was a 6-4, 6-4 loss endured by Fyre, who had just assisted in clinching the doubles point.
 Beyond Fyre, Stanford came out swinging in singles. When USC had last faced the Cardinal in a 7-0 Trojan victory March 23, Stanford had only three matches under their belt while the Trojans competed with match play experience through January.  
Stanford’s late start led them on a six-game winning streak, continued by their 4-3 victory over the Trojans.
 While USC’s loss is a tough blow to their chance at a good seed come championship play, Stanford’s road to victory was filled with an onslaught of tiebreaks and mental challenges.
 Smith and Cuickerman were unable to hold off the Cardinal, both falling in the third set to Stanford’s ability to win the most crucial points.
The clinching match for Stanford was a 6-7 (4), 7-6 (7), 7-5 defeat over USC freshman Lodewijk Westsrate by Stanford senior Timothy Sah. The senior also captured the last needed victory for the Cardinal in their 4-3 win over UCLA a day prior.
The USC freshman led the match early on 7-6, 5-0. Weststrate’s game went up in smoke as Sah barreled back in the second set where he leveled the match at one set all after securing the tie break 9-7.
 Sah’s fight didn’t end with the second set. Weststrate was once again within a game of victory, leading the third 5-3. But, the Stanford senior went on a four-game win streak to close it out at 7-5.
 “I’m feeling like a truck hit me,” Masi said. “It was a tough loss for the guys. We’re winning a lot of matches and we didn’t close the door and finish the job today.”
 USC has a quick turnaround for their final match of regular season play — a meeting with rival UCLA. The Trojans have already edged out two victories against the Bruins, looking for a third this coming Friday at David X. Marks Tennis Stadium at 3 p.m.

More than a year into the coronavirus pandemic, mental health has been a major topic of concern across disciplines. Focused on its intersection with social media, Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism Dean Willow Bay talked with United States Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and Common Sense Media CEO Jim Steyer in a conversation about how young adults manage mental health Thursday. 
Bay started by sharing a video on the report “Coping with COVID-19: How Young People Use Digital Media to Manage Their Mental Health,” conducted by Susannah Fox and Steyer. The report, published in March, details how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the mental health of young adults and how digital media has helped combat the negative mental health effects of the pandemic. According to the study, nearly 40% of all young adults aged 14 to 24 felt some sort of depression during the past year.
USC Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said many young adults, especially college students, were grappling with anxiety and depression before the pandemic, with those numbers increasing significantly since last March. In addition to an increase in mental health crises, Van Orman has also observed a decrease in a sense of belonging among students. 
To combat the detrimental effects of the pandemic on their mental health, many young adults turned to digital resources and social media to remain connected to others, access critical health information and receive comfort in stressful times, according to Fox and Steyer’s report.
“What the research showed is that most young people now turn to social media for connection, for finding relationships,” Steyer said. “We’ve all been stuck on Zoom screens and locked in our houses, so it’s been incredibly important for young people and for all of us to have the connectivity that the web provides, the internet provides [and] that social media provides.” 
Young adults have even used the internet to seek mental health resources like online therapy and counseling during the pandemic, the report said. The use of telehealth resources has set a new standard for online health resources going forward, according to Van Orman. She sees numerous benefits to online health systems, such as increased students seeking care. 
“We saw for the first time ever that our health visits surged over the end of semester between December and January,” Van Orman said. “That’s the time normally where students have a disruption in care, whereas this year, we actually saw students continuing care.” 
Following the conversation about online health services, Steyer explained how the pandemic exposed the “extraordinary inequality” in America. Steyer’s report showed that lower-income communities and communities of color had the highest rates of the coronavirus. In turn, these communities also experienced higher rates of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. 
Van Orman confirmed Steyer’s findings with data from USC. Van Orman reported that African American and Latinx students were twice as likely to have experienced a personal loss of someone in their family who had been impacted by the coronavirus. She also stated that approximately 25% of USC students reported that the pandemic directly impacted their ability to meet their financial obligations. 
Bay introduced Murthy around 30 minutes into the call, highlighting his focus on the mental health of young Americans over the course of the pandemic. 
Murthy started with an apology for his late arrival and said he had been speaking with President Joe Biden immediately prior. He then addressed the events’ participants, saying that the issues surrounding mental health affected more than just those with a diagnosis.
“Not everyone always thinks about themselves as having serious mental illness even though many of us, if not all of us, struggle at points with our mental health and our emotional well being,” Murthy said. “The truth is we exist on a spectrum.”
Murthy said that the future of mental health cannot change unless the culture around it changes and addressed the students in attendance as the agent of that change. When asked about how people will cope post-pandemic, he said the answer lies in communities.
“We need each other for our health, for our success and for our happiness,” Murthy said. “For people who were engaged in the busy work of a busy world — going to work, going to school, writing papers, applying for jobs, buffing your resume, doing all the things you’re told to do as you were growing up — I think this pandemic really [grounded] our world to a halt. It’s separated us from one another.”
Murthy said he has echoed this sentiment about the importance of connection and mental health in conversations with the president over the last year.   
“[Biden] knows how critical and essential mental health is,” Murthy said. 
In an attempt to normalize seeking help, Murthy promoted the idea of therapy as a helpful tool to address mental health. 
“People don’t really understand what therapy is,” Murthy said. “One of the things we have to do to destigmatize treatment is actually to have people talk about their experiences with treatment more.”
Murthy said that the additional time and resources spent on social media over the course of the pandemic helped build a sense of community but carries a potential for harm to mental health as well.
“The experience of passively surfing your feed is the experience of comparing your average days to other people’s best days,” Murthy said. “It can evolve over time, and we can find ourselves trying to be somebody that we’re not or trying to fulfill other people’s expectations rather than showing off as ourselves.” 
Murthy said the best way to remedy the adverse effects of social media was total honesty from its users, but the onus of responsibility ultimately rested with platform developers. 
When asked about addressing the increase in mental health concerns, Murthy emphasized the impact of local connections. 
“I actually think the solutions will be very local; I think that people have to have and start these conversations in their communities, whether it’s on a college campus, or whether it’s in a workplace or whether it’s within your extended family or your circle of friends,” Murthy said. “When [people] have authentic, genuine conversations with each other, that’s a very powerful ingredient for connection.”
