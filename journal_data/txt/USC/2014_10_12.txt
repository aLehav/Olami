Former USC wide receiver Victor Blackwell was identified as the student detained and arrested by the Dept. of Public Safety on Wednesday night in a domestic violence incident involving his girlfriend, according to the Los Angeles Times. Blackwell was detained and arrested by DPS before being transported to Los Angeles Police Dept.’s 77th Street Division station for booking, where he was held on $50,000 bail.

According to DPS’s Daily Incident Log, the incident took place in the University Gateway apartments. The victim told DPS that she was punched in the face multiple times and that when she attempted to escape into her room, Blackwell punched holes in the door. The victim also reported to authorities that Blackwell had destroyed her laptop computer and cell phone, in addition to throwing a chair at her.
Prior to joining USC’s football team, Blackwell attended Santa Ana Mater Dei High School with current freshman cornerback Jonathan Lockett. Blackwell had 54 yards and three receptions in USC’s victory over Fresno State on Aug. 30, but the Cerritos, California, native was reportedly unhappy with his lack of playing time, according to a Sept. 23 interview with Inside USC’s Scott Wolf and head coach Steve Sarkisian.
“He’s frustrated with his playing time, and we’re a little frustrated with his commitment to the program,” Sarkisian told Wolf.
Blackwell sat out USC’s win over Stanford and loss at Boston College, and had not shown up to a single practice after the team returned from Boston. After not hearing from Blackwell for almost a month, Sarkisian announced Blackwell’s dismissal from the team last Thursday.

President Barack Obama visited the city of San Dimas on Friday afternoon to designate a portion of the San Gabriel Mountains as a national monument.
The San Gabriel Mountains, part of the Angeles National Forest, serve as the backdrop to Los Angeles and offer outdoor recreational space for hiking, biking and other activities. The mountains receive nearly 3 million visitors annually.
Congresswoman Judy Chu, a Democrat who represents the 27th congressional district which includes the cities of Pasadena and Monterey Park, led efforts to grant the mountains monument status. She originally sent a bill to Congress, but when it stalled, she called for help from  Obama, who responded by using his executive powers and bypassing Congress to declare the mountain range a national monument.
“It’s not enough to have this awesome natural wonder within your sight,” Obama said in his speech after designating the mountains a national monument. “You have to be able to access it … [E]verybody in this diverse community, no matter where they come from or what language they speak — can enjoy all that this monument has to offer.”
The Angeles National Forest also singlehandedly accounts for approximately 70 percent of Los Angeles County’s open space, and thus provides some of the last available habitat for species like Nelson’s Bighorn sheep and mountain yellow-legged frogs, making the area even more valuable to conservationists.
The combination of conservation efforts and recent upkeep problems led to calls for national monument status, which advocates believe would help improve the area by emphasizing visitor safety. Monument status allows the U.S. Forest Service to prioritize visitor safety, resulting in the installation of restrooms, trails and other amenities. There is also a possibility of increased funding for the Forest Service in the San Gabriel Mountains.
Last winter, the Colby Fire, started by arson, burned through nearly 2,000 acres of the Angeles National Forest. Gaurav Parti, a freshman majoring in business administration, said that the mountains deserved to be protected. His hometown of Glendora, a foothill community, was located near the fires.
“Although they [the San Gabriel Mountains] may not be the most impressive mountains, the landscape of the foothills is unique to California, so they deserve to be preserved and protected, especially after a portion of them was destroyed by the fire,” he said.
Though some local residents were pleased with Obama’s decision, others, particularly Republicans, opposed the designation. More than 100 protesters gathered outside of Chu’s office the Monday prior to the official designation, and protesters were also present when Obama made the official announcement on Friday.
The protesters believe the mountains’ problems with graffiti, trash and fires are exaggerated and that their new status will restrict access to the mountains to them. The community of Mount Baldy rejected monument status, and residents of other communities had similar worries.
In response, the designated area excluded Mount Baldy and a few other communities outside of the Los Angeles County border. A total of 346,000 of the Angeles National Forest’s 655,000 acres are included in the national monument.
“Although it may be drastic to make the mountains a national monument, hopefully this will be a wake-up call to people to treat the area better, and it could help fix problems like trash,” said Alyssa Perez, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering from the foothill town of Glendora.

Tommy Talks hosted its first event in the Annenberg Innovation Lab Saturday night featuring talks by Michelle Lau, Alex Zhang, Logan Heley and Ariel Sobel.
Expand your mind · Alex Zhang, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was one of the four Tommy Talks speakers. His talk focused on the creative benefits associated with lucid dreaming. – Zhiliang Zhao | Daily Trojan
 
Tommy Talks was founded last March, and students have been planning the kickoff event since then. Anne Kennedy is the executive director of the program and has taken the lead in establishing and planning Tommy Talks.
“I love TED Talks,” she said. “We’re not exactly like them — we’re very unique in our own way — but that’s kind of the inspiration.”
The event included four talks on diverse subjects ranging from pornography to politics. The goal is to bring together different leaders on campus to spread their ideas to students whom they wouldn’t normally be able to reach.
“I just wanted to give a platform for students to speak about their interests in an easy way online so students who can’t come to the event today can still get to see, and if they’re interested, reach out and connect in ways they haven’t yet at USC,” Kennedy said.
The planning committee for Tommy Talks has eight executive teams to help prepare for the event. Students on the teams come from all parts of the school, including at least one from each undergraduate school at USC.
“We have such a diverse representation and different ideas coming that it’s really been awesome,” Kennedy said.
For this event, Tommy Talks selected the speakers. For future events, though, students will be able to apply online to give a talk.
The first speaker, Michelle Lau, is a senior majoring in business administration. Her talk focused on the effect that the porn industry has on both self-image and relationships and the need to be aware of the kind of media people consume.
“Porn has hijacked our sexuality,” Lau said.
The second speaker, Alex Zhang, is a sophomore studying business administration. His talk, “Expand Your Mind: Lucid Dreaming 101,” centered on the concept and benefits of lucid dreaming.
“My friends know me as the lucid dreamer,” Zhang joked. “I used to do school projects on it all the time. It works for everything: psychology, philosophy, biology.”
Zhang discussed the positive impact lucid dreaming has on creativity, citing the movie Inception. He also referenced director James Cameron and artist Salvador Dalí, who have both credited lucid dreaming with some of their best ideas.
The third speaker, Logan Heley, a senior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism and history, made the argument in his talk that the American political system isn’t, as many people think, broken. He also stressed the importance of Americans, particularly college students, voting in November’s midterm elections to ensure that young voices are heard.
“What if, instead of extremism from the right or extremism from the left, we as voters demanded extremism from the center, the people willing to compromise?” he asked.
Though Heley’s talk focused on a serious topic, he often used humor to make his points.
“It’s no lie that Congress is not popular,” he said. “They’re less popular than cockroaches, Nickelback and traffic — which in L.A., is hard to believe anything can be worse than.”
Ariel Sobel, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television, gave the final talk. She is a spoken word poet whose writing has been published in the Huffington Post and recognized by two Poet Laureates.
Sobel referred to herself as “an emotional nudist.” In her talk, she emphasized the importance of emotional vulnerability and openness, particularly for college students.
Daniel Musa, a senior majoring in international relations, attended the event and said that he hopes to be able to give a talk in the future.
“I think the toughest part, for me, would be finding a topic that I feel engaged in and that I feel like other people would want to listen to,” Musa said. “[But] I would absolutely be down to do a talk.”
He said that other colleges should follow suit in creating similar events on their own campuses.
“I actually think this is something that should totally be replicated on other college campuses, even in K-12 education,” Musa said. “I think this sort of forum really empowers students to feel passionate about something and to advocate for it.”
The talks will be posted online for further viewing.

Before this weekend, the USC women’s volleyball team was winless on its home floor. On Friday, the No. 20 Women of Troy (10-6, 3-3 Pac-12) earned their coveted first win at the Galen Center in a three set sweep over the Colorado Buffaloes (10-7, 2-3). USC backed the victory up by winning again on Saturday against the Utah Utes (11-6, 1-5).
Killer instinct · Sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu combined for 18 kills this weekend, including 10 against Utah on Saturday. Nwanebu also had two of her team’s season-high 15 service aces in that match. — Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy came out strong against Colorado, a team that they have never lost to. In the first set, both squads played evenly, with neither team being able to build a lead bigger than five points. The big moment in the set was when USC scored seven unanswered points after being down 15-17 to take a 22-17 lead. The squad won the set 25-20 and sported a .355 hitting percentage, which was three times better than Colorado’s .118 mark.
The Women of Troy were more dominant in the second set. The team never trailed after going up 2-1 early, and they led by as many as eight points over the course of the set. USC won 25-18 and had an impressive .400 hitting percentage. Eight of those 25 points came courtesy of three USC service aces and five Buffalo service errors.
The Women of Troy carried their momentum into the third set, jumping out to a 7-1 lead early. The team never looked back, winning the set 25-19 and winning the match 3-0. The squad led by as much as seven points and did not trail during the final set.
USC had strong performances by several players in the match. Junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio led the team in kills with 14, and she also accounted for four of the Women of Troy’s seven service aces. Sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu had eight kills, and senior outside hitter Emily Young contributed seven kills. Sophomore libero Taylor Whittingham led the squad with 11 digs and sophomore setter Alice Pizzasegola was on her game, recording 25 assists.
Overall, USC had nine more kills, nine more digs, five more assists and six more service aces than the Buffaloes. Additionally, the Women of Troy’s .356 hitting percentage for the game was nearly double that of the Buffalo’s .191 hitting percentage.
Less than 24 hours later, USC was back at it again on their home floor taking on the Utah Utes. USC’s confidence and momentum from their game the night before was evident, and the team took down the Utes in four sets.
The first set was nearly all the home team, considering the Women of Troy won the set 25-14. After falling behind 2-4 , USC took control and scored nine unanswered points to take an 11-4 lead.
Later in the set, the Women of Troy had another stretch where they scored six unanswered points to increase their lead to 19-7 before winning the set a few minutes later. The Utes seemed out of sync and were having trouble handling serves from the Women of Troy, who had seven service aces in the first set alone. In addition, their .370 hitting percentage was more than double the Utes’ .152 hitting percentage.
The Utes were more collected in the second set, but still fell 25-20. USC remained in command almost the entire set, trailing only once. The team continued to serve well, coming up with five service aces.
Despite their success in the first two sets, the Women of Troy were not able to pull out a second straight sweep. Utah led by as much as seven points during the third set, despite having fewer kills. The Utes, however, had a better hitting percentage at .303. The Utes also did not commit any service errors, while USC committed three.
USC rebounded in the fourth set, winning 25-18 and taking the match 3-1. Despite having fewer kills and digs in the fourth set compared to the Utes, USC never trailed. The set stayed close until the Women of Troy held a 20-17 advantage, but they scored five of the next six points to seal the deal. The biggest difference for the Women of Troy in the set was hitting. In the fourth set, their .229 hitting percentage was nearly triple that of the Utes’ .081 hitting percentage.
The Women of Troy had three players in the double digits for kills in the game. Bricio led all players again with 23 kills and eight service aces. Nwanebu scored 10 kills and two service aces. Junior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms tied her career high with 10 kills of her own. Freshman outside hitter Lauryn Gillis contributed with four kills and three service aces, and freshman middle blocker Jordan Dunn had three kills and two service aces. Whittingham led the Women of Troy in digs once again with 29. Pizzasegola and senior setter Hayley Crone performed well, combining for 48 assists. For the match, the Women of Troy had 12 more kills, 12 more assists, 12 more service aces and six more digs than the Utes.
After the Utah game, USC head coach Mick Haley addressed the plans for the rest of the season.
“We’re tied with three other schools for fifth place [in the Pac-12],” Haley said. “We still think we may have an outside chance to win the conference. If we can keep building our confidence and momentum, we feel like the sky is the limit.”
Bricio believes her team has turned a corner this season.
“We have a routine before every single game, so we do the same thing,” Bricio said. “But, I think the only thing that made the difference was practice. We had a really good week.”

That victory over Arizona is supposed to feel good. Coming off a demoralizing defeat and going on the road to knock off a top-10 team is supposed to feel good. Regaining sole possession of first place in the Pac-12 South is supposed to feel good. Yet I’d be hard-pressed to find a Trojan fan around who felt joy after watching that fourth quarter. Anxiety, sure. Déjà vu, absolutely. Joy, probably not.
C’mon man! · Head coach Steve Sarkisian was frustrated with the referees for much of Saturday’s last-second win over then-No.10 Arizona. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
Maybe, there was a second or two of celebration when Arizona kicker Casey Skowron missed wide and the Trojans held on to win 28-26. I was worried that the refs were going to buy the flop by Skowron and throw another flag. Thankfully, the only thing worse than Skowron’s accuracy last night was his acting ability.
As the old mantra goes, a win is a win. It is always better to win ugly than to lose pretty. It would be a stretch, however, to say USC really won that game. It’s more like they didn’t lose, which is exactly how the game was coached in the fourth quarter.
When the Wildcats scored in the third quarter to make it 21-13, I was interested to see how the Trojans would react. A mark of a good team is one who responds to adversity and doesn’t wilt away. I was pleased to see USC march down the field and score in Buck Allen’s third touchdown of the game. Maybe this was the identity the Trojans had been searching for all year.
Unfortunately, the rest of the game was more indicative of the Trojans’ true character this year. Right after the touchdown, USC held Arizona to a three-and-out and got the ball back to start the fourth quarter. Instead of going for the jugular up by two scores on the road, the coaches decided to play it safe. They went three-and-out and punted the ball away. There is no drive that better encapsulates this year’s Trojan team than that three-and-out.
Yes, good coaches instill resilience in their teams’ DNA so the players can respond to adversity. That’s not enough, though. Great coaches keep their foot on the gas until the clock strikes zero. Elite teams put their foot on the other teams’ neck and slam the door shut on any notions of a comeback. I hadn’t even considered this until a friend I was watching the game with made that point. If the Trojans are going to be playoff contenders, they need a coach who will adopt this mentality.
One look at this game, and it’s clear that USC is a good team, not a great team. Save for two nice runs by sophomore tailback Justin Davis and one herculean effort by Allen in the fourth quarter, USC would have gone for three straight three-and-outs. On third and six, the coaches dialed up a pass that didn’t go past the line of scrimmage let alone the first down marker.
That’s not the mark of a team with a winning mentality, that’s not a team with swagger. That has nothing to do with the players. Under Eddy O last season, the team oozed confidence. They played with fire and passion; this year they are hesitant, nervously tiptoeing around as if they are a high wire act.
Once Arizona got the ball back after those pitiful calls, they carved up the bent-and-broken Justin Wilcox-led defense to score, and then recovered the ensuing onside kick. Thankfully, icing the kicker worked for the second time during the night, and the Trojans escaped with the win.
In the long run, that win might impede the progress of the team. It acts as a measure of reassurance to the coaching staff. After the game, head coach Steve Sarkisian said something along the lines of USC is a Hail Mary away from being a top-five team. Through that logic, the Trojans are also a couple missed field goals away from being 2-4.
Beating Stanford earlier this year could have the same effect on this season that Lane Kiffin going 10-2 did on his entire tenure — the football version of fool’s gold.
USC didn’t win the Stanford game because of a stellar defensive performance. They got lucky that Stanford made error after error. The same could be said of the Arizona offense and special teams Saturday night.
Some might argue that this is the beauty of the bend-but-don’t-break mentality — it lets teams beat themselves. That argument is beyond flawed, as it would mean USC’s defense is essentially relying on luck to stop other teams.
While it is better to be lucky than good, the problem with luck is that it eventually reverts back to the mean. We saw it happen last week against Arizona State, and it will happen again this year. Eventually, the defense bends enough to break. At this point in the year, the Trojans have found their identity. They are an extremely talented team that is unfortunately handicapped by scheme and philosophy on both sides of the ball.
Eventually, the luck will run out — as it always does — and the coaches will be left with a decision to make. Utilize the skillset of this group: throw the ball between the hashes and down the field, run off tackle and build an attacking defense, or, remain stubborn and stuck in seven-win purgatory. For the long term, maybe what the Trojan football team needs is a little less luck and a strong dose of reality.

The college football gods flipped the script on Saturday night, and the USC football team escaped with an improbable 28-26 road win over then-No. 10 Arizona.
Why not Buck? · Redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen continued his stellar season on Saturday night, racking up 205 yards and three touchdowns. Allen leads the Trojans with 1059 all-purpose yards in six games. — Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
Redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen laid the groundwork for a potential Heisman Trophy campaign, but, in what looks to be a developing pattern for the Trojans (4-2, 3-1 Pac-12), the final score was not decided until the game’s last play.
Down 28-13 as the fourth quarter dawned, the Wildcats (5-1, 2-1) mounted a furious comeback to cut USC’s lead to two with just a minute remaining. After a failed two-point conversion attempt, Arizona receiver Cayleb Jones leapt high in the air to recover an onside kick. The Wildcats then drove deep into Trojan territory, but kicker Casey Skowron shanked a 36-yard field goal attempt with just 17 seconds left on the clock.
After the game, sophomore linebacker Scott Felix summed  up his team’s season to this point.
“It’s crazy,” Felix told USC Trojans. “But that’s just football.”
Allen was unstoppable for much of the night, finishing with 205 yards and three touchdowns on 26 carries. Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler did his part as well, completing 20 of 30 pass attempts for 185 yards and a touchdown. He also threw an interception early in the second half, his first in 190 attempts this season.
USC’s defense looked vulnerable at times, but refused to break in the face of Arizona’s fast-paced offensive attack. Freshman quarterback Anu Solomon and the Wildcats settled for five field goal attempts, and did not score a touchdown until the third quarter. Solomon attempted a career-high 72 passes on his way to 395 yards and a touchdown. All-American junior defensive end Leonard Williams, who had a hand in the crucial two-point conversion stop, credited his unit’s success to nonstop effort.
“We’ve been pretty good at stopping the run the last two weeks,” Williams told USC Trojans. “We’ve been harping on that ever since Boston College. We came out hard, we played hard, and I guess we just deserved it. That’s what it came down to.”
The game’s most noticeable trend started immediately, with Arizona driving deep into USC territory on its opening drive but settling for a 48-yard field goal attempt. In a brutal moment of foreshadowing, the kick went wide, setting up USC at its own 31-yard line for its first series. The Trojans went three-and-out after junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor dropped a third-down pass near midfield.
The Wildcats opened the scoring on their next possession, with a solid punt return from receiver DaVonte’ Neal leading to a 32-yard Skowron field goal. The Trojans responded right away: Allen ripped off the first of two long touchdowns on the night, punching it in from 34 yards out to give the Trojans a 7-3 lead.
The Wildcats added a second field goal as the first quarter drew to a close, setting the stage for more of the Buck Allen show. Early in the second quarter, the Tallahassee, Florida native took a handoff from Kessler at the Arizona 48-yard line and burst into the endzone.
The half’s remaining 10 minutes went by without much action, and USC went into the break with a tenuous 14-6 advantage.
The Trojans looked to be pulling away on their opening series of the second half, finishing an 11-play, 75-yard drive with a 21-yard touchdown strike from Kessler to Agholor. The Wildcats defensive front failed to get any penetration for most of the night, allowing Kessler time to make plays downfield.
USC could have sealed the game midway through the third, but a fumble from sophomore tailback Justin Davis deep in Trojan territory gave the Wildcats new life. Third-string running back Jared Baker found the endzone, marking team’s first touchdown after five trips inside the 25-yard line. The score cut USC’s lead to eight points. Baker, a Los Angeles native, received the bulk of the team’s carries after an injury to Terris Jones-Grigsby, who in turn started the game in place of injured starter Nick Wilson.
The Trojans rebounded immediately with a 13-play, 75-yard drive that set up Allen’s third score of the night. Earlier in the drive, Kessler found senior tight end Randall Telfer on a fourth-and-1 play just inside Arizona territory, helping to extend USC’s lead to 28-13. Telfer, one of the team’s elder statesmen, praised his team’s high level of preparation.
“After last week we just went back to the drawing board,” Telfer told USC Trojans. “We just said everyone do your job, and that’s what we did today.”
To their credit, the Wildcats refused to go away easily. Baker’s second touchdown came on a 41-yard strike from Solomon midway through the final quarter, and, after three punts, Arizona went 80 yards in just over two minutes to cut the lead to 28-26. The team’s first two-point attempt resulted in a pass interference call, while the second was stuffed by Williams and USC’s interior defensive line.
After an onside kick, some questionable play-calling from Arizona and a key timeout to ice Skowron, USC squeaked out a crucial win. The team now takes sole possession of first place in the Pac-12 South.
The game did not come without its share of bad news; the Trojans’ depth at defensive back suffered two important hits, with injuries to freshman Adoree’ Jackson and junior Kevon Seymour. Freshmen Jonathan Lockett and John Plattenburg came on to relieve the pair. Redshirt freshman defensive back Chris Hawkins was impressed by the newcomers.
“I’m very proud of this group,” Hawkins told USC Trojans. “Jonathan Lockett and John Plattenburg both stepped up, and they made plays when it was time to make plays.”
USC hosts Colorado (2-4, 0-2) at the Coliseum next week. The team will look to avoid a third- straight nailbiter.
“God’s got a plan, but we’re not exactly what his plan is for us yet,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “He’s sure testing our will, our resolve, our leadership, our character. I couldn’t be more proud of our team.”

Good food seems to be the only thing missing from the quintessential night out in Hollywood. Brand new clubs boast velvet-roped lines of impressively chic young people. Franklin, Sunset and Vine, is packed with dimly lit bars filled with creative types whose names pop up on movie credits. What visitors and locals alike won’t easily find is a restaurant that serves up great food and lively ambience without breaking the bank. Unfortunately, new addition Madera Kitchen is no exception.
Few bright spots · Dishes like the Smoked Prosciutto provide some highs amid a disappointing experience, but overall the menu feels very tired and safe. This might jus be a new retaurant trying to find its legs, but, if thing continue like this, it doesn’t don’t bode well for the spot. – Rebecca Siegel | Daily Trojan
 
Madera Kitchen opened its doors this past March in the middle of Hollywood directly off of the Cahuenga exit on the Northbound 101. Managed by the brunch experts behind Solar de Cahuenga, Madera Kitchen offers a tired Mediterranean menu that somehow manages to mess up dishes most people would have to try not to ace.
In what used to be a Hollywood nightclub, Madera’s main dining room is huge with high herringbone wood ceilings and seating for well over 60. The décor makes a huge effort to be cool; curated art in trying-to-be-funky flea market frames line the gray walls and turn the vintage industrial vibe into a shade of obvious pretentiousness that can only be noticed once customers realize that their party is the only one dining in the restaurant — save for a few lonely souls at the bar. Madera has a pretty and simple outdoor seating area, but customers will have a hard time getting past the glaring emptiness that marks the sign of a disappointing restaurant.
If customers are able to find street parking on any of the strip-mall-lined streets they get to avoid valet, but if sitting in rush hour traffic on the 101 is already more than enough car time, it is $5 to park right in front of the restaurant. A bored-looking collection of staff mills about the host’s computer waiting for someone to straggle in and hopefully order more than one drink. Once seated, no reservation necessary, customers are brought complimentary flatbreads and their choice of purified, bottled or sparkling water.
Upon first glance at the menu, it’s clear that though locally sourced, its conception was more a chore than a labor of love. Divided into “Meat, Cheese & Bread,” “Share Plates,” “Pasta,” “Flatbreads,” and “Entrees,” uninspired listings like Pasta Pappardelle and Skirt Steak hardly impress.
Since menu offerings aren’t far from what customers could make in their own kitchens, staff assistance is not necessary when choosing the courses to fill the meal.
However dull the menu might look, the appetizers offered under “Meat, Cheese & Bread” don’t actually taste that bad. While there is no culinary genius here, and certainly not any engaging flavor, the appetizers are edible and satisfying even amid the quiet of the empty restaurant. The Smoked Prosciutto ($13)  was far from excellent, but it was flavorful, and though too sweet, the arugula salad was fresh. The Pork Meatballs ($8) from “Share Plates,” were warm and filling and make for a great appetizer or main course since they are the best dish on the menu.
If consuming a large amount of starches very quickly while pairing them with a boring wine list doesn’t sound appetizing, the only non-carb based choices are under “Share Plates” or “Entrees.” Unfortunately for chef and patron alike, the Roasted Half Chicken ($23) is way too rich and totally overpriced for the conservative cut of chicken and greasy sliced potatoes that come soaked in sauce.
The Buckwheat Tagliatelle ($14) tastes like the cooks placed leftover pasta and veggies in a pan, fried it together until it got crispy (note: this dish should not be crispy) and sprinkled Parmesan on top. While the dish boasts locally sourced ingredients, they cannot be discerned underneath the greasy, overcooked pasta piled in an unappetizing heap on a semi-warm plate.
To Madera Kitchen’s credit, they might still be learning to walk, and, with the lack of foot traffic in the area, unable to gain enough patronage to really stretch the kitchen’s legs. If Madera Kitchen keeps serving up food like that to a completely empty dining room, however, it won’t make it to a year in the competitive L.A. restaurant scene.
Madera Kitchen is open Sunday through Wednesday from 6 p.m. to 12 a.m. and Thursday through Saturday from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. The menu is moderately priced, and  a two-course dinner for three, including two beers and one glass of wine, came out to be $98 before tax. Madera Kitchen is also open for brunch as well as happy hour, though no meal besides dinner can be served on the pretty patio overlooking the bustling and urban Hollywood street.

On Oct. 11 and 12, LA Mart hosted the biannual food show Artisanal LA. This seasonal event allows SoCal foodies to taste, shop and sample the wares of local artisanal vendors. The event showcases the finest sustainable, handmade snacks offered in the greater Los Angeles area.
Tasty and healthy · All the food at Artisanal LA is both health conscious and sustainable. Many of the vendors only showcase their wares at the show, otherwise only offering their products online. – Photo courtesy of Artisanal LA
Artisanal LA founder Shawna Dawson is a USC alumna, social media connoisseur and passionate foodie. Once an active contributor to Yelp LA, Dawson eventually became the company’s director of marketing and community manager. She then founded Sauce|LA, a public relations firm that launches restaurants and pop-ups. It is her belief in the power of community and connection to the L.A. food scene that inspired the curation of this showcase.
For only $15 general admission at the door or $12 online, guests were treated to food samples, chef demos, an array of home and gifts items and crafting opportunities.
“This is an amazing event. I try to attend every time it happens to become knowledgeable about the latest food trends,” said attendee Tony Angelo, a self-proclaimed foodie. “It is a great way to support the local economy and get to know what is being offered in the area.”
Many of the vendors only offer their products at food shows such as Artisanal LA and online, making this event a rare treat for shoppers. Here is a round-up of some of the must-try vendors:
COOKIE CONSCIOUS defies everything people expect from a desert. These cookies are free of dairy, wheat, cane sugar, colorings and chemicals. They are a great guilt-free treat made from organic foods. Their vanilla chai cookie tastes of pillowy vanilla goodness, melting in your mouth upon the first bite.
The Sugarbird Sweets and Teas table was consistently surrounded by a swarm of hungry foodies. Founder Kei Okumura’s years of immersion in Japanese culinary culture were evident as she explained the history of matcha to those sampling her famous green tea matcha shortbread. The incredible flavor and texture of her shortbread samples were worth the wait.
It was almost impossible for any meat-lover to resist the Lone Mountain Wagyu station. The rich smell of the beef sausage links was too much to resist. The organic, pasture-raised beef was noticeably distinct from other meats with its earthy, subtle flavor. And, the enticing health benefits of essential fatty acids is enough to make any customer buy their meats in bulk.
Buttermilk, Inc. began as a food truck in Los Angeles featuring incredible pancakes, most notably of the red velvet variety. The mobile food joint has since been closed to focus on selling pancake batter mixes, however. The samples were fluffy, rich and flavorful, making them a must-taste at the event.
Store-bought almond milk has nothing on Celena De Luna’s Raw Nut Milk, a creamy and flavorful product of a painstakingly long process. There are no additives other than an alkalizing water ionizer, which hydrates cells and increases mineral concentration. Though it is not cheap, the variety of flavors will have you hooked. The original raw flavor stands out as a classic favorite, but the chocolate vanilla bean and spiced banana had foodies raving.
“It is incredible that all of the products are created in Southern California,” said Skylar Steinberg, a USC sophomore studying health promotion. “Having taken nutrition classes, these foods are essential to healthy living, and it is shows like this that make them more accessible.”
All of the food at Artisanal LA is health-conscious and sustainable, and it is evident that Dawson only brings in the best of the best. The vendors themselves also happily anticipate the event each season, considering it is one of the best food shows in the Los Angeles area.
“We look forward to this event as a way to expand our business and meet customers,” said Joe Benghiat of Topanga’s Finest, a gourmet beef jerky company. “This beef jerky is a labor of love, and it is great to meet people who feel the same appreciation for gourmet food.”

Residents strolling through Downtown Los Angeles’ historic district this past weekend might have encountered an unexpected surprise: artists creating work directly in front of them on the sidewalk. These artists are participants in the Los Angeles Plein Air Festival, which ran from Oct. 9 to Oct. 12.
Classic feel · The festival aims to celebrate a more traditional form of art where artists simply painted what was in front of them as opposed to modern art forms such as street art and animation. – Photo courtesy of Plein Air Festival
The festival was hosted by Raw Materials Art Supplies and the Downtown Los Angeles Art Walk. Though the Art Walk has showcased local artists since 2004, this weekend marked the first annual Plein Air Festival. L.A. residents have long patronized the art walk as an opportunity to visit artists’ studios and view their work, but the Plein Air Festival featured the added treat of watching artists create art.
“Plein air” is a French phrase that translates to “in the open air.” In terms of the festival, this means that artists painted outside while directly observing their subject: the city of Los Angeles. From local artists, to community members, to historic downtown, the Plein Air Festival integrated various attributes of the city by allowing artists to paint Los Angeles, in Los Angeles while L.A. residents observed.
Typically, the term “art show” conjures up images of a stuffy museum primarily filled with well-dressed, wealthy collectors. Casual and involved, Plein Air starkly contrasts this stereotype by making the creative process tangible to all members of the public.
Besides revamping the way patrons look at art, the Plein Air method also impacts the way artists create art. John Kilduff, a participating artist, explained that while painting outdoors, he must consider additional factors, like “the energy from the street, the people, the cars, the sun, the heat, the cold and [his] mental and physical state.”
Free and open to the public, the festival drew a wide variety of both artists and spectators. Any artist who wished to participate could register beforehand on the festival’s website, leading to a total of 129 unique artists from different parts of Southern California, including Miriam Jackson of San Pedro, California.
Jackson described plein air painting as “one of the most peaceful forms of performance art.” To Jackson, what makes the festival special is that “People pass by and experience the creation of the painting. They get inspired and feel good to see something unusual and interesting. They get to see the work that goes into it.”
Daily “Paint Outs” occured throughout the event, with each Paint Out based in a different portion of Downtown: Spring Street on Thursday, Main Street on Friday, Broadway on Saturday and the Downtown Farmers Market on Sunday. Most artists set up around noon and painted the urban landscape dedicatedly until the sun went down. Kalim Quevedo of Orange County managed to produce a near complete painting depicting the view of Downtown from Spring Street in approximately four hours. Quevedo participated in the Plein Air Festival in the hopes of “encouraging other people to be involved in art and to try outdoor painting.”
In addition to observing artists, the Plein Air Festival offered countless hands-on opportunities for patrons. Casual art demos were offered by Raw Materials Art Supplies Friday through Sunday, making art more accessible to the general public.
The event culminated on Sunday at the Downtown Farmers Market, where artists could sell the very art that patrons watched them create. By the end of the festival, patrons had seen every part of the process: from creating their own art, to watching artists work, to purchasing the final product. Portions of these proceeds will go towards supporting the Downtown Art Walk, allowing the event to come full circle. Participating artists are also eligible for Audience Choice awards, further connecting the artists to their audience.
A must-see stop for festival visitors was the Blackstone Gallery’s “Streetscapes: Downtown Los Angeles” exhibit, which opened on Thursday night. The front wall of the gallery showcases pieces created during the festival with an impressive map display of the streets of Los Angeles. Artists display their finished plein art pieces on the geographic location where they were created, resulting in an interactive collage that blends the work of several artists.
While a large portion of modern art revolves around street art or animation, the streetscapes created during this festival are a tribute to more traditional art methods, in which artists simply painted what was in front of them. The Plein Air Festival balanced this return to tradition with an innovative show format that enhanced the already lively Downtown Art Walk and made art more comprehensive to the average Angeleno.
Jackson hopes that the festival leaves patrons with “a deeper appreciation and understanding of this art form. In order to appreciate something, you have to understand it. By experiencing every step of the creation process in the festival, I hope people will gain a better understanding of what it is that they are looking at,” he said.

Over Labor Day weekend, hackers released private photos of several female celebrities to the public. Dozens of public figures were tied to this illegal photo hack, including Kate Upton, Ariana Grande and Vanessa Hudgens. The face of this ongoing case, however, is Jennifer Lawrence, who received the brunt of media coverage and scrutiny. Though Lawrence initially treated this incident with nonresponse, she broke her silence in an interview with Vanity Fair last Wednesday. Though the cover of Lawrence posing topless in a swimming pool might seem hypocritical, Lawrence did well in underscoring that releasing nude photos is a matter of consent.
In her sit-down with the magazine, Lawrence spoke with fire about the massive intrusion on her privacy. “It is not a scandal. It is a sex crime,” Lawrence said. “It is a sexual violation. It’s disgusting. The law needs to be changed, and we need to change.”
Though it is clear the hackers invaded very personal territory, many questioned the relevancy of Lawrence’s statement. According to the Los Angeles Times, critics of Lawrence’s story say she overexaggerated the situation, calling the Vanity Fair cover hypocritical. In actuality, Lawrence has championed the necessity for consent when publishing any material owned by someone else.
The past few years have been the Jennifer Lawrence golden age. At 20, she was nominated for her first Academy Award. At 22, just two years ago, she became one of the youngest recipients of the Academy Award for Best Actress. On the box office front, she has brought in billions in revenue for The Hunger Games and X-Men franchises. On top of all that, given the amount of “J-Law” pandemonium circulating the public over the past couple of years, I understand the curiosity surrounding her personal life.
Yet, even though Lawrence has found her way into the public eye, she is not a public commodity. Her pictures, or any part of her personal life for that matter, should not be a domain occupied by Internet perverts looking to auction off  illicit photos for Bitcoins. The public, in turn, should not empower these gross actions by viewing these photos.
An example that actually refutes some of the criticism Lawrence has received is her cover photo on Vanity Fair, where Lawrence wears nothing but a diamond necklace while wading nude in the water. Lawrence allowed these photos to be released, so contrary to her critics, it can’t be a hypocritical act because she consented to the publication of the photo. Consent, here, is the fine line that creates a difference between a powerful image and something that is indeed a sex crime.
Perhaps this incident reveals our worryingly apathetic attitude toward privacy. The standard seems to be changing — now anyone can be a publisher of information, posting anything for the Internet to see. Some of this content is unnecessary or inappropriate. Users with profiles are able to be judges of this content with a simple “like” — a mere click of a button. Information seems to be free, but this is not the mindset we should have. Information is a tool that can  be manipulated to harass and depreciate the dignity of others, as these female public figures have shown.
But there is a silver lining in this playbook. By gracing the cover of Vanity Fair, Lawrence refuses to act as a silent victim in this saga. She steers the energy toward our actions and values because Jennifer Lawrence is right: We need to change.

As fall arrives, students around the world set up their Common Application accounts and prepare to spill their hearts out on the pages of their personal statements. Many from overseas will apply to American universities in hopes of joining the 966,333 international students who U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement reports are already in the United States. This whopping figure suggests that the worldwide appeal of American universities appears to be stronger than ever, despite the increasing cost of attending college in the States — particularly for international students who do not qualify for federal financial aid. Though international students often still decide to pay full tuition, their willingness to pay so large a sum reflects both the superiority of American universities and the need for overseas higher education systems to meet higher standards.
Deena Baum | Daily Trojan
 
For years, many American universities have been reaching out to international students by sending alumni abroad to hold information sessions to sell students on the best parts of the American college life: spacious campuses, beautiful weather, state-of-the-art facilities and endless clubs and activities. Though American universities initiate this marketing overseas, they really only have to meet the international students halfway.
There is a self-perpetuated hype about American universities that is particularly prominent in Asia. The cutthroat process of applying to a brand-name American university pressures parents into paying sky-high amounts of money to college prep agencies for a supposed better chance of admission.
For some Chinese students, the application process could potentially cost as much as tuition for a semester or even a school year in college, as these agencies target the popular desire to study overseas for higher education and pin ridiculously high price tags to their services. These charges can range anywhere from a flat $5,000 fee to roughly $10,000 per application, depending on the prestige of the college prep agency and the admission difficulty of the school applied to. To deal with the exorbitant sums before the university sends the tuition bill can be overwhelming to even think about.
If so many international students are coming here for college despite the financial burden, however, it must mean that American universities are doing something right — or that universities elsewhere are doing something wrong.
For many international students, studying abroad in the United States is an opportunity to gain an advantage in the job market back home. Fluency in English, an understanding of American culture and experience at the world’s top research universities can go a long way in standing out among countless other applicants who do not have the same experience.
But what is perhaps more crucial to the steady increase of international students are the push factors. By taking a look at the extremely competitive and rigid education systems in China, India and South Korea, the three countries that have the most international students in the United States, it isn’t too difficult to understand why a student would prefer the American system.
In a 2011 New York Times blog post titled, “To Indian Students, Harvard’s Admission Rate May Appear Almost Welcoming,” the intense but low-profile admission rates of Indian universities are brought to light. The blog states that the Indian Institute of Technology have an acceptance rate of less than 2 percent for pools of half a million applicants. Another New York Times article explores the case of an excelling Indian student Moulshri Mohan, who was offered a scholarship to Dartmouth University but was rejected by Delhi University, one of India’s top schools.
Likewise, in China, students dedicate countless hours to preparing for the National Higher Education Entrance Examination, the single deciding factor for admission to Chinese colleges. This pressures many students to spend more than 12 hours in school every day or risk falling behind their peers. There is exam preparation before and after school, as well as on the weekends, often throughout all of high school. Even though it is a regular way of life for many students, this intensive method takes its toll on the physical and mental well-being of the student.
Though it can be expensive to pay for education in the United States, the influx of international students shows that many people still think it to be the better option. What parents are investing in is not just their child’s future career, but also the physical and mental stability of their child. It is not necessary to dish out tens of thousands of dollars for an agency to help get into an Ivy League school, but if it’s within the parents’ means to send their child to an American university, it would be worth the high tab of tuition.
At the same time, this is not a sustainable trend for the near future if bright minds continue to leave the country. At the end of the day, reforming the education system is the ultimate solution. This might be particularly difficult for China, where the culture of high-pressure examinations has been prevalent for years. Moreover, with the sheer number of students in China, it would be very difficult to establish a holistic application process like that of the United States. That doesn’t mean the Chinese government can’t take action to move away from the rigid, hierarchical arrangement of their domestic universities, however.
With proper reform, studying abroad could come to mean a choice to travel and understand more about other cultures — rather than a necessity for better quality education.
Nice article. Putting aside head counts and the dollars they bring to our campuses, being an international student isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language.
Assistance must come from numerous sources. A new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that can aid anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they contributed to our society, including students.
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a new culture, friendship process and classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work for an American firm here or overseas.
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here.
   Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow
students, and books like this to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.  Good luck to all wherever you study. Fight on!

The college football gods flipped the script on Saturday night and the USC football team escaped with an improbable 28-26 road win over No. 10 Arizona.
Redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen laid the groundwork for a potential Heisman Trophy campaign, but, in what looks to be a developing pattern for the Trojans (4-2, 3-1 Pac-12), the final score was not decided until the game’s last play.
Junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor scored one of the many Trojan touchdowns vs. Arizona on Saturday. — Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
Down 28-13 as the fourth quarter dawned, the Wildcats (5-1, 2-1) mounted a furious comeback to cut USC’s lead to two with just a minute remaining. After a failed two-point conversion attempt, Arizona’s Cayleb Jones leapt high in the air to recover an onside kick. The Wildcats proceeded to drive deep into Trojan territory, but kicker Casey Skowron shanked a 36-yard field goal attempt with just 17 seconds left on the clock. Redshirt sophomore linebacker Scott Felix summed up the Trojans’ season to this point after the game.
“It’s crazy,” Felix told USC Trojans. “But that’s just football.”
Allen was unstoppable for much of the night, finishing with 205 yards and three touchdowns on 26 carries. Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler did his part as well, completing 20 of 30 pass attempts for 185 yards and a touchdown. He also threw an interception early in the second half, his first in 190 attempts this season.
USC’s defense looked vulnerable at times, but refused to break in the face of Arizona’s fast-paced offensive attack.  Freshman quarterback Anu Solomon and the Wildcats settled for five field goal attempts, and did not score a touchdown in the first half. Solomon attempted a career-high 72 passes on his way to 395 yards and a touchdown. All-American junior defensive end Leonard Williams, who had a hand in the crucial two-point conversion stop, credited his unit’s success to nonstop effort.
“We’ve been pretty good at stopping the run the last two weeks,” Williams told USC Trojans. “We’ve been harping on that ever since Boston College. We came out hard, we played hard, and I guess we just deserved it. That’s what it came down to.”
The game’s most noticeable trend started immediately, with Arizona driving deep into USC territory on its opening drive but settling for a 48-yard field goal attempt. In a brutal moment of foreshadowing the kick went wide, setting up USC at its own 31-yard line for its first series. The Trojans went three plays and out after junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor dropped a third down pass near midfield.
The Wildcats opened the scoring on their next possession, with a solid punt return from DaVonte’ Neal leading to a 32-yard Skowron field goal. The Trojans responded right away: Allen ripped off the first of two long touchdowns on the night, punching it in from 34 yards out to give the Trojans a 7-3 lead.
The Wildcats added a second field goal as the first quarter drew to a close, setting the stage for more of the Buck Allen show. Early in the second quarter, the Tallahassee, Florida native took a handoff from Kessler at the Arizona 48-yard line and bursted into the endzone. The half’s remaining 10 minutes went by without much action, and USC went into the break with a 14-6 advantage.
The Trojans looked to be pulling away on their opening series of the second half, finishing an 11-play, 75-yard drive with a 21-yard touchdown strike from Kessler to Agholor. The Wildcats defensive front failed to get any penetration for most of the night, allowing the Bakersfield, California native time to make plays downfield.
USC could have sealed the game midway through the third, but a fumble from sophomore tailback Justin Davis deep in Trojan territory gave the Wildcats new life. Third-string running back Jared Baker found the endzone, marking team’s first touchdown after five trips inside the 25-yard line. The score cut USC’s lead to eight points. Baker, a Los Angeles native, received the bulk of the team’s carries after an injury to Terris Jones-Grigsby, who in turn started the game in place of injured starter Nick Wilson.
The Trojans rebounded immediately with a 13-play 75-yard drive that set up Allen’s third score of the night. Earlier in the drive, Kessler found redshirt senior tight end Randall Telfer on a 4th-and-1 play just inside Arizona territory, helping to extend USC’s lead to 28-13. Telfer, one of the team’s elder statesmen, praised his team’s high level of preparation.
“After last week we just went back to the drawing board,” Telfer told USC Trojans. “We just said everyone do your job, and that’s what we did today.”
To their credit, the Wildcats refused to die easily. Baker’s second touchdown came on a 41-yard strike from Solomon midway through the final quarter, and, after three punts, Arizona went 80 yards in just over two minutes to cut the lead to 28-26. The team’s first two-point attempt resulted in a pass interference call, while the second was stuffed by Williams and USC’s interior defensive line.
An onside kick, some questionable play-calling from Arizona and a crucial timeout to ice Skowron later, USC squeaked out a crucial win. The team now takes sole possession of first place in the Pac-12 South.
The game did not come without its share of bad news; the Trojans’ depth at defensive back suffered two crucial hits, with injuries to both freshman Adoree’ Jackson and junior Kevon Seymour. Freshmen Jonathan Lockett and John Plattenburg came on to relieve the pair. Redshirt junior defensive back Chris Hawkins was impressed by the newcomers.
“I’m very proud of this group,” Hawkins said to USC Trojans. “Jonathan Lockett and John Plattenburg both stepped up, and they made plays when it was time to make plays.”
USC hosts Colorado (2-4, 0-2) at the Coliseum next week. The team will look to avoid a third straight nail-biter.
“God’s got a plan, but we’re not exactly what his plan is for us yet,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “He’s sure testing our will, our resolve, our leadership, our character. I couldn’t be more proud of our team.”
