Graduation ceremonies can be one of the most exciting and memorable parts of a young adult’s life. After completing years of schooling, surely filled with challenges and growth, an important aspect of a commencement ceremony is documenting it. However, as new students graduate in the ever-advancing technological age, standards surrounding commencement must be maintained, which includes eliminating the presence of distracting elements at the ceremony. Therefore school administrations should have the right to discourage students from taking selfies, a photograph that one has taken by oneself usually with a smartphone and uploaded to a social media account, at commencement ceremonies.

According to the Sacramento Bee, the administration at Elk Grove High School near Sacramento, California decided to withhold diplomas from two graduates who took selfies while walking across the graduation stage. The administration, who had warned students prior to the ceremony not to take selfies, characterized the students’ actions as “inappropriate behavior.” The school reasoned that selfies slowed down the progression of the already long ceremony.
And it seems like it would have. The high school has an enrollment of 1,800 students, according to the school’s website, which would mean that about 450 seniors were graduating across the stage during the ceremony. If each student took the moment to stop and take a selfie before crossing the stage it would surely slow the ceremony down.
The problem is not with documenting the ceremony and act of graduation — it’s the method by which it’s now being done. In the U.S., senior portraits and yearbooks are common memorabilia for graduates to mark the end of their schooling. Yet the growth in technology and the selfies trend has changed the way graduation day looks.
People between the ages of 18-24, or college-aged people, according to a 2013 study by StyleCaster, are the most likely to take selfies. Furthermore, each day more than 1 million selfies are taken and posted to social media accounts.
With the growth in freedom that technology and selfies bring, students might think that the school administration does not have the place to regulate whether they can take selfies or not. Yet standards need to be set on this growing trend.
Since the school institution is doling out the cash for the graduation ceremony and is in charge of planning it, school officials should have the right to set the rules. Yes, students and their families generally contribute to the funds of the school. Then again, in return for the payments, they are receiving an education and a diploma with the school’s name on it.
Yes, selfies are en vogue. But traditions have been around longer. If a school deems it necessary to maintain the sanctity of a commencement ceremony (not to mention its flow) by restricting students from taking selfies on the stage, then they should be allowed to do so.
The rules and regulations will have to be taken with a grain of salt, however. Though rules may be in place there’s always going to be the handful of students who will try to sneak in a selfie right before they grab their diploma, the same way that for years students have been cartwheeling and dancing across the graduation stage even though the administration prohibits it.
Yet a school must stay firm in the rules they have outlined, and if the students’ diplomas must be withheld for a few days because he did not heed the warnings, then so be it.
There are plenty of opportunities for students to have photo ops by more traditional areas on campus. Plus the real memories made at college will not come from a hastily taken selfie on the graduation stage. Instead, they are documented in the days, semesters and years before. That should be the real focus on graduation day.

Seattle’s City Council ventured into unprecedented economic territory Monday when its nine members unanimously voted to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Already boasting the nation’s highest minimum wage at $9.32 an hour, Seattle will become more than just an economically progressive state — it will act as an experiment for other states to examine the true effects of such a high minimum wage.
Increases in the minimum wage generally adjust for inflation or rising costs of living, and nothing more. While the higher wage has a huge backing in Seattle, other cities considering a similar increase should contain their excitement; not only does Seattle have a very unique economic climate that might not apply to other cities, but there is also a startling lack of empirical data that makes the wage increase a scientific shot in the dark.
It makes sense that Seattle was the first city to pass such a reform: the city’s mayor, Ed Murray, included the wage increase in his platform as one of his top priorities, and city councilmember Kshama Sawant officially identifies as socialist. In addition, the growth and presence of large companies such as Amazon and Boeing have fundamentally shaped the job market and population of Seattle as a whole. Just because the increase was supported popularly and politically, however, does not mean it had sound backing in economic principles and data.
In fact, given the unprecedented nature of the increase there is no economic data at all to justify it — his kind of wage increase has never been observed and studied by economists and politicians. This does not inherently mean raising the minimum wage will have a negative economic impact, but any economic policy set by primarily political motivations should be monitored closely.
The city council, of course, is acting to ensure a smooth transition: the wage will incrementally increase over the next several years at different rates based on businesses’ size and the benefits they offer. These measures, however, will only serve to lessen the shock of the reforms. Such a dramatic wage increase will undoubtedly have dramatic effects — whether they will be beneficial or not overall can only be speculated on.
And there are plenty of reasons a $15 minimum wage could backfire. Sawant aims to “turn the tide against corporate politics” with the new wage, but the situation is much more complicated than a simple battle between employees and corporations — small businesses could be driven to bankruptcy, and even larger companies that could potentially afford it might move to cut costs. Also, the wage increase is not statewide; the increase could cause businesses to move to nearby suburbs that refuse to adopt similar changes.
Even more ambiguous is who will be bearing the brunt of the costs involved in the wage increase. It could be the very business that the law attempts to curb, but consumers will also need to acclimate — it’s not a question of if the price of goods will go up, but how much the increase will be.
Even the employees the reform seeks to protect could be adversely affected, as employers will have to find ways to cut costs and adjust to paying such a high wage. At SeaTac airport near Seattle, for example, a $15 minimum wage has already been implemented. According to Forbes, a cleaning lady at a SeaTac hotel lost her 401k, health insurance and other benefits as a result of the wage increase, and a part-time waitress reported making less than she did before with her $7 salary and tips. She also now has to pay for parking and bring her own food. Making more money per hour, although at first glance beneficial to the employee, can cause unforseen problems down the line.
This isn’t to say the wage increase will be universally negative, however. According to the New York Times, more than 24 percent of Seattle residents earn less than $15 an hour — considering how widely supported the increase was, it’s obvious that many of these people will have a much higher standard of living. Income inequality in America is indisputably a problem, and there are plenty of supporters who believe minimum wage reform can help alleviate the issue.
By setting such a high minimum wage, Seattle is setting a precedent for other cities around the country, and since income inequality is such a hotly debated topic some, of these cities will feel pressured to follow Seattle’s example. The true effects of the wage increase, however, won’t be fully understood until it is fully implemented and has been observed for a few years. The rest of the nation should wait and see how Seattle’s reforms play out before following suit.

Due to the joint efforts of USC and the city of Los Angeles, Southern California has been designated a “Manufacturing Community” by the federal government and will receive priority access to $1.3 billion in funds for local aerospace and advanced manufacturing. USC President C.L. Max Nikias and Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti made a joint announcement at a press conference on May 28.
“The Manufacturing Community designation has profound implications for Southern California, especially in aerospace and defense,” Nikias said in a press release. “For the past 50 years, USC has enjoyed very close ties with these industries and has educated some of the brightest talent in their ranks.”
The effort, led by Garcetti and USC, brought together academic institutions, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, government agencies and the aerospace industry to create the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership for Southern California. The USC Center for Economic Development at USC Price was the lead co-applicant.
“My top priority is to leave the recession in the rearview mirror by making sure Los Angeles is ready for the jobs and industries of tomorrow,” Garcetti said at the press conference.
Southern California was one of 12 communities selected for the designation from a pool of 70 applicants. The economic plan, potential for impact and the depth of public-private partnership were all factors in the decision.
“It’s a very great day, I’m glad we won,” said Leonard Mitchell, executive director of the USC Center for Economic Development at the press conference. “Now we can really get on with the work that will be beneficial to the southern region of California and in fact, the whole state of California.”

“The University of Southern California is committed to supporting scholarly talent from all over the world, and Mexico is an especially important partner in creating intellectual capital that benefits our region and accelerates growth in both of our countries,” Nikias said in a press release.
The delegation’s visit followed the U.S.-Mexico Bilateral Forum on Higher Education, Innovation and Research, convened by Meade and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, which took place on May 21.
USC has featured prominently in recent talks between the United States and Mexico. Thomas Sayles, USC senior vice president for university relations, joined Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti on a trade mission to Mexico in March. The mission marked the announcement of a collaboration between USC and the Bank of Mexico Fund for Development of Human Resources that will provide scholarships for some master’s students.
Earlier this year, the USC Price School of Public Policy announced a joint program with Mexico’s National Council of Science and Technology to provide graduate fellowships.
Both these initiatives are built on the success of previous collaborative efforts between USC and its counterparts in Mexico.
USC has had the highest enrollment of international students among all colleges and universities for more than a decade according to the Institute of International Education. In addition to Mexico, USC also maintains offices in Brazil, China, Taiwan, South Korea and India.

A new air quality study done by the Keck Hospital of USC shows that jet emissions from the Los Angeles International Airport are affecting more people than previously thought.
Dirty air · The Los Angeles International Airport has over 1,500 takeoffs per day. The Keck study results reveal that the effects of jet emissions are detected as far as 10 miles away from the airport. – Photo courtesy of Creative Commons
As the third busiest airport in the United States, LAX logs more than 1,500 takeoffs per day. With that amount of traffic, the team of researchers from Keck was determined to verify just how far the jet pollution spreads.
“We had seen in previous studies that there was some suspicion that the impacts from LAX on air quality was much larger than previously measured,” said Scott Fruin, a USC assistant professor of preventative medicine and lead researcher on the project. “Indeed, when we went out, we found that the impacts were much, much larger than previously found.”
Setting out in hybrid vehicles specialized with   real-time instruments to measure air quality, the team drove an area of about 10 miles downwind from the airport.
After a 29-day period, what they found confirmed their suspicions.
Instead of jet emissions being picked up only a mile or less from airports as previously thought, the researchers discovered the effects continued for up to 10 miles or more away from LAX, encompassing an area of 23 square miles.
“We found that the downwind impacts were frequently more than ten miles as opposed to say a half mile or a mile,” Fruin said. The total area covered was 23 square miles — it’s a very big swath of downwind area, a big piece of L.A. County.”
Particle number, or PN, concentrations in the 23 square mile area were double compared to the background levels, or those without the LAX contribution, the study reports.  As the distance got smaller — to about two miles east of LAX — the concentration levels were almost 10 times higher.
“Therefore, the LAX should be considered one of the most important sources of PN in Los Angeles,” wrote the research team in the study, which was published in the American Chemical Society journal Environmental Science & Technology.
This high concentration of particles is potentially harmful for the health of those living in the affected area.
The most common pollutant that the team found were ultrafine particles — which, because of their small size, some studies say can reach deep into the lungs and be more toxic than larger particles.
“Jets are particularly efficient producers of ultrafine particles,” Fruin said. “One thing that we hope to come out of this study is a little bit more impetus for devoting more resources to studying the health effects of ultrafine particles.”
In addition to that, Fruin and his team hope that the study will put a greater spotlight on the effect of airport pollution for those in the impacted area.
“One thing I think it immediately proves is we have to take a new look at airports, and look at their total impacts which might be a lot bigger than say a mile or two,” Fruin said. “We also should start adding a health component that includes these larger populations and were going to be doing that ourselves at LAX.”
Funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the Environmental Protection Agency, the study results come at a time when Los Angeles has been declared to have the worst metropolitan area ozone pollution by the American Lung Association.
“One real key question is: Are there health impacts … due to airport emissions?” Fruin said. “That’s something were very interested in determining because the number of people impacted is so much larger than previously thought.”

After a successful season that resulted in a runner-up finish at the NCAA tournament and an individual national championship for junior Doris Chen, the USC women’s golf team picked up several postseason honors over the weekend. For the second time in each of their respective collegiate careers, Chen and sophomore Kyung Kim were named First Team All-Americans by the Women’s Golf Coaches Association.

Chen was named a first teamer as a freshman before picking up second team honors after the Women of Troy’s national championship 2013 season. The Bradenton, Florida native started slowly this spring, but rebounded nicely with a second place tie at the Bruin Wave Invitational in early March. Chen also made a statement at the Pac-12 Championships, leading her team to a second-place tie with a third place finish of her own. After struggling to a 10-over finish at the NCAA West Regional, she bounced back in a big way with a two-stroke victory at the NCAA Championships in Tulsa. With the win, Chen became the Women of Troy’s fifth individual national champion.
Kim is now the fourth USC player to be named a First Team All-American in each of her first two seasons at the school. She got off to a hot start this fall, winning and tying for second place in her first two events. During the spring, the Chandler, Arizona native took home a win at the Bruin Wave Invitational and finished in the top-10 three other times. Kim took fourth at the NCAA regionals and finished at 16th in the national tournament. Her 11 sub-70 rounds this season broke a USC record.
Also recognized were freshman Karen Chung and sophomore Annie Park, who were named Second Team All-Americans. Chung was strong in her debut season with the Women of Troy, tying for third at the Stanford Intercollegiate and earning a victory at the San Diego State University Farms Invitational. The freshman was named to the All-Pac-12 second team as well based on her early-season performance. Park, who won her own NCAA individual title in 2013, did not miss a step in her sophomore campaign, winning the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge in the Women of Troy’s first action of the spring. She was also instrumental in the team’s postseason success, tying for second place at the NCAA regionals. The Levittown, New York native led her team with a stroke average of 71.50, good for second in school history. The only better mark came from Park herself during her phenomenal freshman season.
Now-alumna Sophia Popov was named an honorable mention, becoming the second USC women’s golfer to ever earn All-American honors four times. Popov was a first teamer in 2011 and 2013, and adds a second honorable mention to her tally this year. Though she did not win an event in 2014, the German native was remarkably consistent, placing in the top-10 four times. This consistency helped her pick up All-Pac-12 First Team honors as well. After a slow start, Popov was a key part of USC’s valiant comeback effort in this year’s NCAA championships. She leaves USC a national champion and two-time NCAA runner-up.
Veteran head coach Andrea Gaston received postseason honors of her own, notably her second consecutive Pac-12 Coach of the Year honor. Gaston has won the award three times in her storied career, which includes three team national titles and four second-place finishes. She has also coached five NCAA individual national champions. Gaston’s 2014 season at USC included a nearly wire-to-wire No. 1 national ranking and nine victories, a school record.

After being crowned national champions in May, five members of USC’s men’s tennis team earned Pac-12 honors last week, including the Pac-12 Singles Player of the Year award as well as the Pac-12 Doubles Team of the Year.

Junior Yannick Hanfmann headlined the group, being named the Pac-12 Singles Player of the Year. The Karlsruhe, Germany native finished the season ranked No. 10 by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association and went 24-6 overall on the season, including an 18-4 mark in dual match play.
Hanfmann was ranked No. 18 in the ITA’s preseason poll in September, but slowly climbed up the ladder to the 10-spot. In October, he won the ITA Southwest Regional Championship in a 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 effort over Pepperdine’s Alex Sarkissian, who finished as the runner-up in the NCAA singles championship last month.
In 2014, Hanfmann went 4-0 in Pac-12 play and helped lead the Trojans to an undefeated conference slate and the regular-season Pac-12 title. The junior, who clinched championship point in the Trojans’ 2012 NCAA National Title campaign, quickly made an impact as he developed a knack for defeating some of the nation’s highest ranked players. In the Trojans’ regular-season finale, Hanfmann defeated UCLA’s Clay Thompson, the No. 1 singles player in the nation, in straight sets.
During the NCAA tournament, Hanfmann went undefeated in singles against four ranked opponents. In the semifinals against No. 4 Virginia, Hanfmann topped sixth-ranked Alex Domijan, 4-6, 7-6 (10), 6-4 to clinch a spot in the championship match for the Trojans.
In the finals, Hanfmann defeated Oklahoma’s fifth-ranked Guillermo Alcorta, 7-5, 6-2 for his second upset of the tournament.
Hanfmann backed up his success in singles this season with stellar play in doubles with senior Ray Sarmiento. The duo finished the season ranked No. 1 in the country and was named the Pac-12 Doubles Team of the Year.
Hanfmann and Sarmiento went 15-4 on the season together and 3-0 in Pac-12 play. They earned the No. 1 spot in the nation on April 22, at which point they had only lost to then-second-ranked Peter Kobelt and Kevin Metka of Ohio State in the championship of the ITA National Team Indoor tournament.
The two Trojans were named to the All-Pac-12 first team along with junior Roberto Quiroz. Quiroz was USC’s winningest player in singles this season, going 32-6 overall, 24-3 in dual match play and a perfect 6-0 in Pac-12 competition. At one point, the Ecuadorian put together a 20-match win streak, which included five match clinchers.
Hanfmann joined UCLA’s Thompson and Marcos Giron as the only players unanimously voted onto the Pac-12 first team.
Though at one point Sarmiento was ranked as high as No. 3 in the nation, he uncharacteristically faltered down the stretch of the regular season. The two-time team captain tallied up a dismal 2-4 record in Pac-12 competition, which could be responsible for him  not having been unanimously selected for first-team honors. In the NCAA tournament, however, the senior found his footing at precisely the right time: down 1-2 against Oklahoma in the NCAA championship match, Sarmiento secured the equalizer point to tie the team match in singles play. The Rancho Cucamonga, California native  finishes his collegiate tennis career as a five-time All-American and a three-time national champion.
Junior Eric Johnson and sophomore Max de Vroome earned All-Pac-12 honorable mention awards.
Johnson went undefeated in singles play during the NCAA tournament to finish out the season with a 32-9 overall record and an impressive 23-3 mark in dual-match play.
His doubles partner de Vroome clinched the national title for the Trojans with a grueling three-set comeback victory over Oklahoma’s No. 53 Andrew Harris. De Vroome’s aggressive serve and volley game overwhelmed Harris in the final set. The win also capped off an undefeated NCAA slate for the Vught, Netherlands native, who posted a 26-10 overall record on the season.
Hanfmann, Sarmiento, de Vroome and Johnson were also named to the NCAA all-tournament team at the No. 1, No. 2, No. 4 and No. 5 spots, respectively.
USC and UCLA led the Pac-12 with five players from each school earning All-Pac-12 honors.

On the men’s team, senior Aaron Brown qualified in both the 100 meter and 200 meter; redshirt senior Aleec Harris qualified in the 110 meter hurdles; junior BeeJay Lee qualified in the 100 meter and senior Viktor Fajoyomi qualified in the decathalon. On the women’s team, junior Alexandra Collatz qualified in the discus; junior Melia Cox qualified in both the triple jump and 100 meter hurdles; senior Jessica Davis qualified in the 100 meter; redshirt sophomore Tynia Gaither qualified in both the 100 meter and 200 meter; freshman Amalie Iuel qualified in the 400 meter hurdles; junior Vanessa Jones qualified in the 400 meter and senior Oluwakemi Olonade qualified in the triple jump.
In the relay races, both the men’s and women’s 4×100 meter relay as well as the women’s 4×400 relay team qualified. The men’s 4×100 team consists of Brown, Harris, Lee and redshirt senior Terrence Abram; the women’s 4×100 team is made up of Gaither, Davis, senior Loudia Laarman and sophomore Alexis Faulknor and Davis, Jones, junior Akawkaw Ndipagbor and senior Ashley Liverpool represented the 4×400 team.
A total of 16 athletes will don cardinal and gold at the national championship.
Harris set the Pac-12 record for fastest time in the men’s 110 meter hurdles with a time of 13.18 to win the event. Harris’s time broke a 36-year-old conference record. Greg Foster of UCLA set the previous record with a time of 13.22 in 1978. The time was a personal record for Harris and improved the school record of 13.32 that he had previously set. The time was also the fastest ran by any man in the country and second fastest in the world this year.
Brown ran the fifth fastest time in the world this year in the 200 meter with a time of 20.16. A native of Toronto, Canada, Brown broke the Canadian national record that was set in 1991. Brown also ran a 10.12 to qualify in the 100 meter. Lee ran a 10.16 to qualify in the 100 meter. Lee finished in fifth place in the event, five hundredths of a second behind the winner. Brown finished in second place. Fajoyomi is the 15th of 24 seeds nationally in the men’s decathlon after scoring 7,489 points in regionals.
Collatz qualified in the discus with a toss of 54.06 meters, finishing in fifth. Cox was the 12th and final runner to qualify in the 100 meter hurdles with a time of 13.44. She also finished in 11th place in the triple jump with a distance of 12.69 meters. Davis finished ninth in the 100 meter at 11.52. While Gaither’s time of 11.63 trailed Davis’s, Gaither’s heat ran against a sizeable headwind, and Gaither’s wind-adjusted time was good enough for ninth place. Gaither’s time of 22.88 placed her fifth in the 200 meter. Iuel’s 58.10 in the 400 meter hurdles placed her 12th in the event. Jones placed fourth in the 400 meter with her time of 52.15. Olonade also placed ninth in the triple jump with her leap of 12.72 meters.
The men’s 4×100 meter relay team finished in ninth place with a time of 39.59. The women’s 4×100 meter relay team ran a 43.55 to finish in third place. The women’s 4×400 meter relay team placed fifth with at 3:31.94.
The team is led by Caryl Smith Gilbert, who was named director of track and field last June following the retirement of Ron Allice. Allice led the Trojans to 32 individual national championships during his 19-year tenure as the program’s head coach and also coached the women’s team national championship in 2001. Smith Gilbert was a former All-American sprinter at UCLA and was the head coach of the University of Central Florida’s women’s track and cross country teams before joining USC.

Who wouldn’t pay to watch Tom Cruise struggle against the ravages of time?
Time to kill · In Doug Liman’s sci-fi thriller Edge of Tomorrow, Tom Cruise (left) plays William Cage, a futuristic soldier who finds himself caught in a time loop while attempting to thwart an alien invasion. – Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
On paper at least, Edge of Tomorrow has all the ingredients of a surefire hit. Cruise’s latest foray into the world of pop-dystopia boasts a compelling, high-concept premise, an aging but still-bankable leading man, a cast of genre stalwarts including Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton and a director – The Bourne Identity’s Doug Liman – known for injecting jocularity and wit into effects-driven event pictures. It’s also an unlikely critical success, currently enjoying an impressive score of 89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes as of this writing.
So why did the film, made for a reported $178 million, only manage to nab $20 million during its international rollout last weekend? Why is it expected to underperform again, this time to the tune of $30-35 million, when it’s released stateside this Friday? The answer is simple enough: Even though it’s barely June, audiences are already suffering from the seasonal disorder known as blockbuster fatigue.
After months of being bombarded with nothing but concussive spectacle and Adam Sandler’s latest paid-vacation-masquerading-as-comedy, it’s only natural for audiences to start being more selective. Certain movies, especially those that aren’t sequels, prequels, spin-offs or adaptations of well-established properties, are bound to slip through the cracks between box office behemoths such as X-Men: Days of Future Past and Disney’s Maleficent.
This kind of exhaustion doesn’t usually set in until late July or early August, but 2014 will forever be remembered as the year Hollywood tried to have summer in April. Marvel’s bold decision to release Captain America: The Winter Soldier on April 4, almost a month ahead of its nearest spandex-clad rival, the underwhelming Amazing Spider-Man 2, paid off in spades when the star-spangled sequel became the highest-grossing April movie ever, raking in more than $95 million during its opening weekend alone. Yet it also set an alarming precedent for expanding the release window for blockbusters. Suddenly would-be tentpoles such as the animated family comedy Rio 2 and the doomed Johnny Depp vehicle Transcendence felt comfortable making their debuts during a month typically reserved for unproven comedies, one-and-done horror movies and middle-of-the-road actioners.
Edge of Tomorrow is set in the near future, on an Earth that’s in the final stages of repelling a devastating alien attack. The glowing, arachnid-like invaders, nicknamed “Mimics” for their ability to respond to humanity’s military tactics, have taken over much of Western Europe, but mankind is on the verge of a decisive victory thanks to the development of a series of supercharged mech suits, commonly referred to as “jackets.”
The plot centers on Major William Cage (Cruise), a cowardly advertiser-turned-soldier who finds himself stuck in a time loop after unwittingly tapping into the aliens’ technology. Now, like the protagonists of Groundhog Day and Source Code before him, Cage is condemned to relive the same day over and over again until he can find a way to break the cycle. The key to his temporal salvation might be Special Forces soldier Rita Vrataski (Blunt), a celebrated war hero who once encountered a similar fate. She agrees to train him, but only on the condition that she can “reset” him (i.e. kill him, thus forcing him to start the day over) whenever he steps out of line.
Liman’s film is based on Japanese author Hiroshi Sakurazaka’s critically acclaimed 2004 light novel and its subsequent manga adaptation, which carried the nonsensical but infinitely catchier title All You Need is Kill. After Warner Bros. secured the rights, screenwriter Dante Harper was put in charge of writing a spec-script. Harper’s finished work appeared in the 2010 edition of “The Black List,” a catalog of popular but unproduced screenplays published annually by development executive Franklin Leonard. The current script lists three additional credits, including Christopher McQuarrie, the writer and director of several other Cruise vehicles, including Jack Reacher and the recently announced fifth installment of the Mission: Impossible series.
The advertising for Edge of Tomorrow should be selling the movie as a welcome respite from the interminable franchise fodder that makes up the bulk of blockbuster season, but its $100 million marketing campaign has been dispiritingly rote and uninspired so far, contributing to the notable lack of buzz surrounding the film. Its first theatrical teaser, for example, with its terminal overreliance on shaky-cam, derivative-looking aliens and austerely auto-tuned soundtrack, bore a near-tragic resemblance to the trailer for Jonathan Liebesman’s notoriously awful alien invasion flick Battle: Los Angeles.
Without a built-in fanbase or flashy advertising to support its domestic release, Edge of Tomorrow may be forced to rely on good old-fashioned word of mouth in order to make its money back. If the film is half as clever, intense and character-driven as the early reviews are suggesting, it will find its audience eventually, either in theaters or in the eventful afterlife of Blu-ray and Netflix. Just give it time.

The name Pop Psychology evokes the kind of bright, Warhol-esque images that a band that calls itself Neon Trees might be expected to conjure. And that was partially by design, the band’s frontman Tyler Glenn admitted. But while the term is aesthetically light and vibrant, it also contradicts the album’s more serious theme.
Keeping it real · Since coming out as gay to Rolling Stone a month ago, Neon Trees frontman Tyler Glenn has felt more in tune with his fanbase. The band’s work on Pop Psychology served as a catharsis for Glenn. – Photo courtesy of Creative Commons
The group’s third album earned its first No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Rock Albums chart and landing its highest debut on the Billboard 200 at No. 6, outranking its previous two efforts.
Pop Psychology is short for popular psychology, Glenn explained. He encountered the term during therapy sessions, whose content influenced and informed much of the album’s material.
“Visually it made me think of really colorful things like Pop Art and it was thematically with the depths of the record,” Glenn said. “I felt it was a title that caps off the whole thing.”
Glenn might seem like a happy-go-lucky ball of surplus energy, but on the inside, the singer who grew up surrounded by the Mormon faith in Utah was actually struggling with his identity — last month, the frontman came out as gay in an article by Rolling Stone.
As has been the case with many public figures in the recent past, Glenn’s brave honesty has been respected and heralded by the general plurality. Some have even lauded him as a role model for individuals who may find it difficult to weigh their religious beliefs against their sexual orientation. It’s a consequence Glenn said he perhaps naively failed to consider, especially as someone who is still trying to figure things out for himself. That’s something he’s always been upfront about.
“I think if anything, what it sounds like people really enjoyed about me coming out and my story and the way I’ve deal with it,” Tyler said. “I’ve done it really honestly and openly and I think people can’t really fault you for that.”
By the same grain it’s hard to fault Neon Trees for the honesty and vulnerability it bears on Pop Psychology. While the band’s third LP is undoubtedly its boldest foray into the deeply emotional and personal, it would be a mistake to overlook its previous serious content, which often gets lost under its infectious melodies.
The band is best known for 2012’s radio anthem “Everybody Talks,” which can be shallowly interpreted as a whimsy romp about false gossip. But Glenn said that the subject of that song is about something serious for him: it stemmed from a rumor about his sexuality. This time, Glenn delves deeper.
“I found myself writing things for this record when I was in a place where I was climbing out of the darkness,” Tyler said. “By the end I was a really happy dude and I feel like the record is kind of a celebration of the things that I hated about myself before.”
The track list questions identity and finding love, particularly in a difficult modern and technological age. Tyler said he drew inspiration from his and his friends’ experiences. They’ve all recently turned 30 and are single, or just got out of relationships. Those love plight stories are translated in songs like “Love In The 21st Century,” “I Love You (But I Hate Your Friends)” and “Text Me In The Morning.”
“I think it speaks to people my age and I think it also speaks to people who are young who are about to go through the same things,” Glenn said.
The song that seems most approachable, “Teenager In Love,” was the most difficult for Glenn to write.
“It sounds like it’s the lightest, most youthful song on the record, but for me it’s the saddest song on the record,” Glenn said. “It’s really about me being in the closet and being in love with someone I’m not allowed to be in love with because I couldn’t tell anyone.”
When Glenn analyzed the situation, he drew similarities between confused teenagers who are teeming with emotions they can’t quite express. Instead, he said, teenagers dissect all the conversations they’ve had with the person they love. It was a situation Glenn found himself in his 20s. The casual listener might miss that subtlety.
“My spin on it, when I hear it, is that it’s really sad and vulnerable,” Glenn said.
Though the album is personal, and is derived from a place of darkness, Glenn describes himself as a happier person, and one that embraces revisiting those memories. It’s a sweet misery, one the listener can certainly bob his or her head along to, should everything underneath get lost in the pop. Glenn wouldn’t mind.
The band will make a stop in Los Angeles during its tour, which has been receiving a more authentic response from fans than on previous tours, Glenn said.
“I don’t know if that’s because we’re at our third record and our fans are more invested, but I think the crowd just feels more connected to the nuances of the songs,” Glenn said. “They know more about me as a songwriter and know where I’m coming from.”
