Expect to hear “drop, cover and hold on” tomorrow, when the Southern California Earthquake Center holds its second annual Great California ShakeOut, a statewide earthquake drill that included nearly 5.5 million participants last year.
On Oct. 15 at 10:15 a.m., people across California — including USC — will participate in the simulation aimed at improving the general public response to a potential natural disaster.
“Participation is strongly encouraged,” said Steven Goldfarb, fire safety and emergency planning specialist at USC. “Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t react the right way when an earthquake hits, and when they do, it could be too late to avoid injury … We’re trying to get people used to doing the right thing, which is drop, cover and hold.”
At the Health Sciences Campus, SCEC will also be testing the preparation of USC’s earthquake emergency response team, which involves participants from departments across campus including Public Safety and Hospitality, Goldfarb said.
The SCEC plans to hold the response test every year, alternating between the University Park and Health Sciences campuses.
“We’re trying to embed it into the culture at USC … We want to do this every single year so that it becomes a regular routine thing,” Goldfarb said.
Based on last year’s feedback, Goldfarb said SCEC has also improved the simulation and corrected portions of it that were lacking.
To adequately address the issue of fires breaking out in an earthquake and the difficulty of communicating in such a situation, the event will now include a fire engine, a radio communication team and 100 additional volunteers trained in first aid, search and rescue, and fire suppression.
“We want to be able to show we can be self-sufficient,” Goldfarb said. “After a 7.8 [magnitude earthquake], we can’t rely on 911 services, so we need to be able to take care of our staff, faculty and students. We’d do it even if the Shake Out didn’t exist because we need to test out our plans.”
All of the respondents involved have received training and had smaller drills, but the simulation will provide an opportunity for the entire team to get some experience working together.
Knowing how to react in an earthquake could come in handy very soon. According to SCEC’s website, the San Andreas Fault has a 59 percent chance of producing a 6.7 or greater quake in the next 30 years. Across California, the chances of a 6.7 or greater earthquake are 99.7 percent.
“That’s not in 30 years — that is anytime,” said Mark Benthien, executive director of Earthquake Country Alliance, who was involved in the planning of the event. “It could be today.”
The recent water main breaks that have prompted scientists from the Jet Propulsion Lab to investigate any increase in tremor activity in the region have not directly affected the simulation, but Goldfarb said the drill would include preparing for broken pipes to better prepare the facility management team.
While many students said they only vaguely remember last year’s drill, a few remember the simulation, which took place at the University Park Campus. Connor Flanagan, a sophomore majoring in cinema-television production,  volunteered as a victim.
“I woke up early, went and had a bunch of blood and makeup thrown on me, and hid out in one of the music buildings until rescuers came and assessed me,” Flanagan said. “It was really fun to get all bloody and strapped to a gurney, but I think it was most useful for the emergency responders.”
Flanagan also remembers, however, that many students were not aware of the drill, and did not believe many professors participated.
Helen Liu, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, said she remembered last years’ simulation, but didn’t think the event was that successful at equipping the public.
“Honestly, I think there’s only so much you can do to prepare,” Liu said. “They don’t anticipate the mass fear that will happen. [But] because they are trying to get them used to it, the fear and panic will be less.”
To promote the ShakeOut this year, SCEC has asked faculty members to be more involved and actively participate in the drill. The team will also issue a Trojans Alert to remind people on campus to participate.
A number of students said the drill, and the reminders, can be beneficial — especially for students who are not used to earthquake preparation.
Brett McCoy, a sophomore majoring in business administration from Whittier, said many of his friends panic at the slightest tremor, a problem which could be addressed by the drill.
“When you get the smallest shake, people will be in shock … Some will be, ‘California earthquake!’ while others will just be scared,” McCoy said.
Though the Big One might just be a rumble away, organizers are hoping students, staff and faculty will be ready to deal with it.
“I’m from Minnesota so every time I go home I secretly hope that it will happen while I’m gone,” Flanagan said. “I know it’s coming but life goes on. You can’t stop living just because of Mother Nature.”
WOW, No I get spam on trojan alerts about these fun little students activities. I signed up for Trojan Alerts so that I can get current emergencies not every little safety drill.
ITs called natural selection:
If an earthquake happens those with the retarded genes who choose to calm themselves down by smoking a cigarette near the leaky gaspipe right underneath the stone bridge get eliminated from the gene pool.
Great to have shakeout, stop sending me TXTs for it BECAUSE I PAY FOR THOSE. I want text only in a serious emergency

At his first press conference since being introduced over the summer, USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill discussed the challenges ahead.
Sitting between senior guard Dwight Lewis and junior guard Marcus Simmons, O’Neill was optimistic yet practical, noting that while the road ahead may be long, all hope is not lost.
Real talk · Men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill says his team will be thin at point guard and opponents will be gunning for Dwight Lewis. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“I’m not sitting around lamenting the status of our players, but it’s a matter of how soon we can get together as a group,” O’Neill said.
O’Neill admitted he can’t fully assess his squad until Friday, the first day of practice. The workouts, which will be open to the public, will be the first time O’Neill will be able to conduct practices with the entire team. But he had no question that the team had been working hard in the offseason.
“I’m pleased with our work ethic as a group,” O’Neill said. “I like how our guys have approached work in general.”
Simmons especially made a concerted effort to work on his jumpshot this offseason, shooting up to 1,000 shots a day to the point where he hurt himself.
“Just one day my wrist started aching really bad, it was swelling up on me,” Simmons said, adding, “It’s fine.”
O’Neill said he would know a lot more about the Trojans’ dynamic after 10 hours of practice time in the gym this weekend, but he highlighted some early concerns.
“Obviously we have unproven point [guard] play,” O’Neill said. “Donte [Smith] didn’t play much last year and we’re going to depend heavily on him.”
O’Neill noted that redshirt senior guard Mike Gerrity will also factor into the point guard position, but not until the second semester when he is cleared academically.
When asked who else could help out Smith until Gerrity returned, O’Neill pointed to the two guys sitting next to him, Lewis and Simmons. Both will play more minutes than they ever have before, O’Neill said, and Lewis especially will have to prepare for other teams to be gunning for him.
“Dwight doesn’t know this yet, but people are sitting around the league saying, ‘OK, if we’re going to play USC, we’ve got to stop Dwight Lewis first,’” O’Neill said. “And I’m not sure that was always the case last year.”
Lewis did not shy away from the responsibility at all, however.
“I think I handled it quite well. [O’Neill] expected me to be a leader during this offseason, and I think I’ve done a pretty good job,” Lewis said. “All the added pressure — I really don’t see it right now.”
Lewis also responded to the low expectations many are placing on the Trojans this season.
“With this team we have now, we really don’t care what other people think,” Lewis said. “We all believe in each other, we believe in ourselves, we believe in our coaching staff.”

This year, the Actors’ Gang heard the phrases that nobody wants to hear: “no money,” “economic downswing,” “reduced endowments,” “it’s best to not produce any plays this season.”
Artistic Director Tim Robbins responded with the first words — well, letters — that came to his mind: “WTF?!”
The Actors’ Gang, which has produced and performed numerous award-winning plays for more than 20 years, faced an unfortunate dilemma. How could a drama group renown for its theater ignore its artistic calling?
In response to recommendations that called for an empty season, the members of the Actors’ Gang rebelled. They decided to be proactive, to ignore the crippling effect of faltering outside funding that had already debilitated many independent performance groups.
Instead, inspired by the first words uttered by their artistic director, the ambitious inaugural “WTF?!” Festival was born — an event spanning two months, incorporating countless mediums and featuring numerous headliners.
From Oct. 13 until Dec. 19, the Actors’ Gang’s 99-seat theater will be home to a medley of performers, including Sarah Silverman, Tenacious D, Jackson Browne, Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie and Gore Vidal. Robbins, who curates each event, envisioned a festival utilizing the support of both the Gang and outside artists. In doing so, the festival incorporates a remarkably eclectic mix of performance art; between talkbalks and documentary showings, there are live concerts, poetry slams, a vaudeville circus and even a Culver City-wide carol.
“I believe that our space can be much more than just a theater space,” Robbins said. “Most of [the performers] invited don’t have homes within Los Angeles … I’m looking at this as a way to not only open our door to new audiences but to open our doors to other groups in this economy that can’t afford to rent space.”
The festival is certainly an ambitious project. Primarily, it hopes to raise money for the group and for its many community outreach programs. Among the latter are the group’s arts curriculums in the Culver City School District, its summer family theater program, summer children’s theater and theater workshops in adult and juvenile correctional facilities.
Despite the Gang’s monetary aims, this festival still includes many chances for a broader community audience. Many of the events featuring well-known performers are crafted as fundraisers, but the festival’s free and low-cost events reflect the group’s underlying principle to do anything it can to serve the community.
“We want to make theater for everybody, not just for the people that can afford it,” Robbins said. “The survival of a community organization or arts group is not just in the money; it’s in the people coming to your doors.”
In many ways, the Actors’ Gang is lucky. Because of its big-name members and bigger-name support, it can find ways to endure and overcome a dwindling economy that tends to scapegoat art. Many theater companies are folding, countless individual venues are closing and some museums are even shutting its doors after years of community support. Robbins states that independent theater has to “find creative ways to survive in an economy like this,” but creativity is sometimes insufficient when support is already fickle and ephemeral.
In this “crap” economy — as Robbins puts it — art is disappearing from many societal spheres. Across the country, arts programs are waning in elementary, middle and even high schools to account for increasing budget cuts. Even summer camps focused on the arts for youth are being forced to increase their prices and reduce financial aid options. Television shows like Glee may be voicing the need for artistic and creative growth in every individual’s life, but art is deemed trivial and unnecessary when funds are cut and redistributed, Robbins said.
“It’s a real shame. There’s a direct connection between creative thinking and arts programs. It’s not enough just to teach math and science and English; you have to involve other parts of the brain. It’s a lack of vision in our educators.”
Though the Actors’ Gang is not the first to experience economic whiplash, its response to this universal problem is unique. In the face of an economic crisis that ostracizes long-established donors and condenses already slim governmental and educational grants, this festival will open its doors to outside artists, friends and potential new audiences in an attempt to ride out the economic drought.
Beyond the aspirations of the festival are concrete plans for the Gang — currently, a few members are touring Spain performing an adaptation of George Orwell’s 1984, and the Gang is also preparing for a major production in January — but the next two months, its hopes are placed on the stage of the Ivy Substation.
“Part of the theme of the festival is to reach new audiences,” Robbins said. “To make them aware of the company and the work we do and hopefully in doing so, create an experience that will make them come back to theater.”

USC women’s basketball coach Michael Cooper did not hold any punches during his introductory press conference Tuesday, although he set his sights not on traditional rival UCLA, but an unusual foe.
“I’ll bet you we play better basketball than the Los Angeles Clippers and you go to quite a few games there,” Cooper told a reporter in attendance. “Oh yeah, you can write that down.”
It may have only been a joke, but the comment represented a significant change for the basketball program. Gone are the days when former coach Mark Trakh would refuse even to address injuries as one player after another went down. There is a new feel around the program now with Cooper, who brings not only a wealth of coaching and playing experience, but also a fresh attitude.
“They know I’m a little different coach and I have a sense of humor about me, but there’s going to be a work ethic about it,” he said.
And if you know anything about Cooper’s playing days as a lockdown defender for the Los Angeles Lakers, there will be a little defense too.
“I think one thing you can expect from this team is hard play every night,” he said. “Obviously we’re going to come with the defensive intensity and our offense will be opened up to where it’ll be exciting for the fans.”
One question that Cooper faced during his press conference was how he would handle coaching in a new environment, but the new coach did not seem too worried.
“Coaching is coaching no matter what level,” he said. “I’ve coached at many levels, even going back to coaching my son when he was six or seven years old.”
Cooper might not expect the transition from coaching professional basketball players to amateur athletes to be difficult, but he will have to overcome some hurdles.
He just finished his coaching obligation with the Los Angeles Sparks this fall and has had little time to spend with his new players. He has never had to recruit a player before. And his roster is full of talented but injury-prone players. None of the question marks surrounding the team have dampened Cooper’s enthusiasm, though.
“This is just another venture and another door that’s been opened for me and it’s one that I’m very, very lucky to have and one that I’m honored to have,” he said.
The players are equally excited to have the former Lakers great at the helm. Sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath said the players know a lot more about Cooper than people may think and are looking forward to learning from him.
“We’ve seen him play games even though we’re younger people,” she said. “We’ve seen him on the court, we’ve seen what he’s about and we know he’s had so much experience.”
Whether all of that experience translates to wins is yet to be seen, but the Women of Troy are clearly glad Cooper is here.

After being third on USC’s quarterback depth chart all season, redshirt junior Mitch Mustain reclaimed the backup role, a position he shared with redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp last season.
Corp, named the starter after the end of spring practice, had been the backup to freshman Matt Barkley and started USC’s Pac-10 opener against Washington; now he assumes the third-string duties for the Trojans.
Moving on up · Redshirt junior quarterback Mitch Mustain, once considered left out of the quarterback race, has shown enough improvement in the past few weeks to earn the No. 2 spot behind Matt Barkley. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
“Looking back, I was given a shot [against Washington] and I didn’t perform,” Corp said. “But, I was told we’re still competing, so that’s the way I’m looking at it.”
Mustain, who split snaps with Barkley with the first team at practice Tuesday, said he’s finally hitting his stride.
“I feel like I’ve been more consistent the past three weeks or so and I’m playing to my potential,” Mustain said. “It’s just settling some mechanics issues I had this summer; I could tell something was out of the ordinary and had been for awhile. I finally took the opportunity this summer to get it fixed and I think it helped a lot.”
Mustain’s ascension to the backup role is coach Pete Carroll’s fifth depth chart change since the beginning of spring practice. The reasons for the changes have ranged from injuries to performance in practices, but Carroll insists there is a method to his constant tinkering.
“We’re just trying to get the guys ready and play who’s the best; there’s nothing more to it than that,” Carroll said. “Aaron will come battling back — he’s not going to let up at all, he’s a competitor, but really this is about Mitch doing better.”
Carroll also noticed Mustain’s improved mechanics, which helped make his decision to name Mustain his back up against Notre Dame.
“Mitch is throwing the ball better right now, more firm, more effective — that’s it,” Carroll said.

South Bend, Ind. will offer the coldest conditions under which the Trojans have played all year, and — right on cue — the weather in Los Angeles cooperated Tuesday, giving the Trojans a rainy, miserable day to prepare for conditions not yet faced this season.
The game-time forecast is predicted at the low 40s, but the low 60s in Los Angeles was about as good as the Trojans could have asked for in preparation for Saturday’s night game.
“This was the start of the week for us, great conditions to work in. This is an advantage for us we can’t usually conjure,” Carroll said. “It helps us with all the issues that come with [the weather].”
For starter Matt Barkley, the weather is daunting but doesn’t take away from his enthusiasm.
“Today was good for us [to] get the ball wet and see what we do with it, and we had no fumbled snaps and the footing was good,” Barkley said. “I’d say wind is the worst, but I’m stoked.”
u
The conditions at Howard Jones Field Tuesday were unusual for the team — especially the rain‚ which gave the practice a more playful feel.
Junior running back Joe McKnight had some footing issues after scoring a touchdown during practice and couldn’t slow himself down before sliding out of the back of the end zone and falling on his back, uninjured.
A large trough of water appeared on the side of the field, in which coaches and players ended the day in a slide-off.
Among the sliders were offensive line coach Pat Ruel and defensive line coach Jethro Franklin, who won the competition.
“Franklin threw a heck of an effort in the waning moments, he slid about six feet past where a man should go,” Carroll said.

He said it.
During his introductory press conference Tuesday afternoon in Heritage Hall’s Varsity Lounge, the new Women of Troy basketball coach Michael Cooper — yes, that Michael Cooper — quoted The Godfather in explaining his rationale behind taking the USC job.
You can probably guess what he said, but let me give you a little background first.
Seasoned pro · New USC women’s basketball coach Michael Cooper is not only a former WNBA coach but also a former Los Angeles Laker. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Cooper won five NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s as one of the league’s first defensive specialists — Bruce Bowen before there was Bruce Bowen, if you will. Larry Bird frequently referred to “Coop” as the best defender he ever played against.
After his playing career ended, Cooper successfully jumped around the coaching world, spending parts of seven seasons at the helm of the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks, a season as head coach in the NBDL, and even filling an interim head coaching position with the Denver Nuggets of the NBA for a month in 2004.
Suffice it to say, he’s a proven coach.
Yet, he said Tuesday that moving — down, most would argue — to the women’s college basketball ranks was a no-brainer.
And he did this while alluding to one of the best movies of the 20th century.
“When the opportunity came up, I couldn’t say no,” Cooper, 53, said at his press conference. “It’s almost like that old mafia rule, ‘I’m gonna make you an offer that you can’t refuse.’”
He was joking, of course, but still, you have to wonder where Cooper’s coming from.
The Women of Troy finished an average-at-best 17-15 last year, failing to qualify for the NCAA Tournament.
Then the two leading scorers from last year’s team graduated.
Then USC’s top-rated recruit in the class of 2009 — forward/center Monique Oliver, a McDonald’s All American — asked for her release and signed with Rutgers.
An offer you can’t refuse?
I wouldn’t say so.
But to each his own, and USC will reap the benefits of Cooper’s opinion.
He will be an instant upgrade to Mark Trakh, who resigned in April after five seasons in Troy. Cooper brings an undeniable pro swagger to the Women of Troy and that important defensive reputation. He already has three titles to his name as a head coach. And he’s from the Pasadena area.
Translation: Apart from his coaching abilities, he’ll also be able to recruit the best and brightest, including athletes from Los Angeles that have looked away from USC in recent years.
He’s already growing on his players, who appreciate that pro experience, usually unseen at the women’s collegiate level.
“We know a lot more about coach Cooper than people think,” said sophomore Briana Gilbreath, the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year last season. “Even though we’re younger people, we’ve seen him on the court, we’ve seen what he’s about. We know he has so much experience.”
They also think he can help a talented roster mesh together.
USC already has a lot of talent on its roster. Gilbreath, a 6-foot-1 guard, led the team in rebounding in conference play while averaging 10.5 points per game. Sophomore point guard Ashley Corral averaged 8.5 points while earning Honorable Mention Pac-10 All-Freshman honors.
Redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos was named National Player of the Year in the class of 2006 by most recruiting services before tearing her ACL three times. She’s yet to appear in a game with the Women of Troy, but 30 days before the season kicks off with a home date against Xavier, she finally appears healthy.
And there’s more: Returning seniors Hailey Dunham, Aarika Hughes and Heather Oliver bring leadership and, collectively, nearly 18 points per game from last season.
Of course, Gemelos isn’t a sure thing, and neither is the team’s potential.
But don’t tell that to the Women of Troy.
“Once coach Cooper came in, it was like that last piece to our puzzle,” Dunham said.
One thing is for sure about Cooper: He’s brash — in a good way. He didn’t sugarcoat anything in front of the media Tuesday.
“I know the process is gonna be tedious,” Cooper said of his first year as a college coach. “I know it’s gonna be a journey, but right now I think our coaching staff and our players are ready for the journey that we’re about to encounter.”
And he certainly didn’t shy away from taking digs at other Los Angeles teams.
He did so — twice, in fact. First in line was his former team.
“The biggest thing is that we are a very talented team as far as shooting the basketball, much more so than the Los Angeles Sparks,” Cooper said to laughter from his players flanking him at the podium. “We’re talented in a lot of different areas.”
Then he went after the men.
“I bet you we play better basketball than the Los Angeles Clippers,” Cooper said while trying to convince a reporter to come out to Women of Troy contests. “Oh yeah, you can write that down.”
Will do. We’ll see, Coop.

Hitting the big time in the music business is rather akin to winning the lottery — regardless of whether you struggle against the odds for years or score a major success on a one-off chance, the industry is essentially a crapshoot of epic proportions.
Boston-based band Passion Pit can be considered one of the luckiest entrants after it nailed a record deal and big-name tours less than a year after releasing its first proper recording, 2008’s EP Chunk of Change. Having shot out onto the tour circuit as soon as it put the finishing touches on its debut LP, Passion Pit has had more than enough opportunities to put in the kind of work most bands take years to achieve.
Beach bums · Originally created to display love songs written by singer and keyboardist Michael Angelakos’ for his then-girlfriend, Passion Pit is now touring to support its second album, Manners. The band is known for its lively, up-beat concerts and will complete its tour in Tokyo. - Photo courtesy of Tell All Your Friends PR
“It’s been an absolutely crazy time,” said bassist Jeff Apruzzese from the band’s bus as it rolled through Kansas. “We’ve been so lucky. Back when Chunk of Change was first released, no one thought we’d be granted these kind of opportunities.”
Indeed, few could have foreseen the rapid explosion in popularity in what started as a creative love letter. Singer and keyboardist Michael Angelakos wrote what would become Chunk of Change and most of Manners as a gift to his then-girlfriend as a sort-of peacemaker back in April 2007. It didn’t take him long to figure out that these weren’t just your regular love odes.
“Most of the material we play nowadays was originally just Michael and his laptop singing these Valentine’s Day tunes, performing in a very folklore sort of way,” Apruzzese explained. “Eventually, he talked to Ian [Hultquist, guitarist] and that led to the rest of us signing on and soon [around May 2008] it was a full-blown group show.”
Shortly after Chunk of Change was released, the hype machine really began to pick up steam. Massive buzz from the Boston music press, “up-and-coming” articles from the likes of MTV and the BBC and the requisite thumbs-up from Pitchfork all contributed to a record deal and one of the most anticipated debuts of the year with Manners.
Unlike many blogosphere sensations that came before them, however, Passion Pit did not disappoint. Manners was well received by critics from Paste Magazine to Rolling Stone, and charted reasonably well for an independent release, especially overseas. It’s dreamy electro-pop — heavily buttressed by an array of synthesizers and highlighted by Angelako’s falsetto tones — was the perfect summer album. Mixing a well-disguised appreciation for mainstream pop melodies with a vibrant electronica flavor and a heavy debt to the ’80s, Manners comes off sort of like MGMT on steroids — a sparkling indie pop factory.
Of course, Passion Pit was already well on the way to cementing its remarkable live show literally moments after finishing Manners.
“The day after we laid down the final vocal tracks in the studio, we were out on the road starting the tour… When we first went out on the road, we were playing 35, 40-minute sets, because we only had about seven or so songs all down,” Apruzzese said, laughing. “We were still learning to play everything, and we were headlining shows. It was definitely rough for a little while.”
But something must have clicked, as Passion Pit was soon receiving rave reviews from across the country for its lively concerts. The young band has already toured with such indie stalwarts as Death Cab for Cutie, Girl Talk and Franz Ferdinand and made prominent festival appearances at Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza last summer.
The group’s own headlining tour, which is set to end next February in Tokyo, has already sold out a number of shows, including the Henry Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles tonight. This abrupt rush of fame and media exposure has not been lost on the band, however.
“Just a couple weeks ago I was eating ice cream outside a café in Northampton [Mass.] and Thurston Moore [of Sonic Youth] sat down next to me,” Apruzzese said. “Just to have these huge influences talk to us and tell us how they like our music, it’s crazy. I mean, Bruce Springsteen watched our show at Glastonbury [Festival, in England], and enjoyed it — that’s ridiculous.”
Although Passion Pit has a long way to go before it can finally relax after a rigorous touring schedule, the band remains committed to continuing to build up its group rapport and spread its accessible brand of oddball pop. A thoroughly modern band, Passion Pit has repeatedly used iTunes and other online retailers to promote its music and release bonus tracks. After all, it’s the blogosphere that is largely responsible for their success.
“Internet has taken a hold of music,” Apruzzese said. “It’s had a huge impact on the response of our band — on the Internet, you can develop an instant connection. It’s so easy for people to put music out there, and with Chunk of Change and before Manners it was all Internet buzz. I miss going to a record store and blowing all my money and just spending the day listening to a new record. But at the same time, we’re now playing clubs in the Midwest that we’ve never been to before and selling them out.”
And for good reason. Passion Pit has already proven its not just another blogger flavor of the month, showing a verve for relentless touring and an irresistible urge to entertain. Of course, it helps that the material on Manners has already made it a strong candidate for debut record of the year. Combine that with a band that seems to have an infinite reserve of energy, and you have a force to be reckoned with.
“It’s been pretty exhausting, but we are all loving it,” Apruzzese said. “It’s been a great year, and we’re definitely not slowing down anytime soon.”

It’s undeniable that Hockey is turning heads worldwide.
OK, this might not be the type of hockey you’re thinking of. Forget the skates, knee pads and overly aggressive fans. This type of Hockey consists of a four-piece band that could be the next big thing in the music industry.
Too fake · Although Hockey is signed to a major label, the band’s socially critical lyrics and funk-heavy dance beats exemplify the independent ethos it has held since forming in 2007. - Photo Courtesy of EMI Music
With the Oct. 6 release of its debut album, Mind Chaos, Hockey is ready to take the general public out for a dance, as it has been doing with music youths, bloggers and critics for the past several months. The eclectic Portland, Ore.-based band plays around with various musical styles — including a true indie sound complete with repetitive sequences, classic country song patterns, captivating ’80s grooves and funky bass lines — to create tracks that can strike up a dance party at any time.
“Mind Chaos is a concept album that serves as a soundtrack for popular culture in general,” said bassist and founding member Jeremy “Jerm” Reynolds.
And a truly intoxicating chaos it is, brewing a sarcastic yet hypocritically biographical tone and one of the most interesting and commercially accessible projects to be released in 2009.
Hockey had the fortune of being discovered and funded by the major label Capitol Records at the end of 2008. As Reynolds put it, Capitol Records was kind enough to “fund our art project.”
“We really just want to get our music across and get people to hear our songs,” Reynolds said.
With Capitol Records as a deep-pocketed supporter, Hockey gets the best of both worlds, acting as a big card for a hugely influential player in the music industry while also maintaining the independent creative freedom needed to create a legitimate product that can compete in the indie scene.
Even before Mind Chaos hit stores, Hockey has been ferociously climbing the industry’s ladder, from playing small bars in Los Angeles and Portland to opening for popular indie bands such as Friendly Fires and Passion Pit. The group appeared at significant festivals like Lollapalooza and even cemented its own headlining tour in less than a year.
Luckily, Hockey, in Mind Chaos, lives up to its hype. Songs like “Work” and “Too Fake” are dance-y and upbeat, while “Curse This City” and “Wanna Be Black” accentuate the band’s funkier elements. “Preacher” and “Four Holy Photos” lean toward a more spiritual approach that sounds as country as early Kings of Leon albums.
“Song Away” — the only track that was not self-produced by the band — is the album’s standout piece with its fusion of wittingly written lyrics and ’80s-pop feel. Ironically, the song loosely narrates the band’s journey — truly, tomorrow is just a song away, and that can happen faster than one can imagine.
Hockey’s lyrics also serve as commentary on society, music and today’s music industry told in first person. This is best expressed in “Too Fake,” where lead singer Benjamin Grubin shamelessly belts, Look out/Cause I’m just too fake for the world — the perfect example of how the band’s members are hardly modest or afraid to express their strong ideas.
Clearly, Hockey has enough substance to be a band that excels in the music world — give them enough time, and this relatively young band will certainly become a group of fun-loving, indie-rock entertainers.

Dear Wild Thing,
In commemoration of the movie release of Where the Wild Things Are this Friday, I am writing you a love letter. I’m not sure if you can read this — is it discriminatory of me to think that a Wild Thing lacks literacy? — but I wanted you to know that despite the years that have passed, and despite the imaginary ocean that separates us, you still remain a ferocious part of my soul.
After reading about your adventures with Max when I was but a young child, all I wanted was a fuzzy onesie and a kingdom of Wild Things to rule. I had two younger sisters, sure but they weren’t quite as fun as the towering beasts that Max indulged in. They drooled and cried all the same, but where was the reckless abandon and crazy eyes? I wanted to sail across the seas and find myself on an uncharted island; I wanted to dance and howl and engage in ridiculous shenanigans with you by my side.
Max wasn’t the only one to be sent to bed without supper because of disobedience — my grumbling tummy was also a source of defiant pride. You were complicated and misunderstood and rebellious, just like me. You needed someone to guide and lead you when I needed someone to love me. I’m sorry that, in the end, I left you just as Max did. But who can resist the sweet aroma of a home cooked, apologetic dinner?
But it’s OK. You know as well as I do that I never really left that island of obscure wilderness, recklessness and freedom. None of us have ever truly left. When midterms approach, we growl. When our football team engages in yet another mindless, overconfident and ridiculously awful play, we dance about our campfires of popcorn buckets and chili cheese fries to a furious, chaotic rhythm. And when finals approach like the rising moon, we lift our heads and howl, instinctually and collectively, into the night sky.
No, we no longer chase our dogs with forks or tell our mothers that we will eat them. We have shed these silly habits. But we must now travel in vessels larger than the tiny sailboat that was once sufficient for our compact body — larger vessels like a four-tire automobile used to escape the horror of our realities along the Grapevine. With every struggle of inner turmoil, you find us there, next to you, howling and dancing and shunning the world.
You taught us so many important life lessons, Wild Thing. You taught us that we can conquer any fearsome-looking monster by simply staring unblinkingly into its eyes. Steady, confident resolve makes anyone a king.
You taught us that we should never be ashamed of homesickness, that speech is at times overrated and that anger is, although potent, ephemeral.
You taught us that the world is troubled, that there is sorrow, fear and violence but that they can be overcome.
You empowered us, Wild Thing — you let us be your kings and, in doing so, you opened our eyes to imaginary worlds of possibilities. Also, you were furry with large teeth. I would have listened to anything you wanted to say to me.
You know what’s funny, Wild Thing? I loved you and praised you but when I told my friends about you, they read your book and spat on its gleaming covers.
There are only nine sentences, they told me. The story is about a brat kid being a brat, they said. The Wild Things are creeps, one even declared! When I was a little girl, nine sentences were enough to convey a complete story. I didn’t need to be told how to feel or what to see — Max channeled my fury, my regret.
Why is it that with the advance of age, anger is suddenly an embarrassing and disgraceful emotion? Why can’t we dance and howl and prance with you in our whimsical jungle, Wild Thing, when anger inevitably comes? I would much rather don a fuzzy onesie than pull a Christian Bale and use my grown-up voice.
It will be strange to see you on the big screen, Wild Thing. You will be large and menacing and wild, but gentle all the same.
When I watch you and Max embark on your adventures, I know that the world will get a bit more tangled, a bit more messy and wet — until I find myself in a sailboat, roughing tumultuous waves as I come to you.

If The Office teaches us anything, it’s that people don’t always like their jobs.
The reasons vary, but statistics show that most people fall into one of three groups. In a study done by University of Chicago Professor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the three main workplace complaints were lack of challenge and variety, conflicts with colleagues — particularly bosses — and too much pressure. Contrary to popular conception, salaries and material benefits were not the most pressing issues for working people.
Julie Vann | Daily Trojan
It’s obvious that people aren’t getting everything out of their jobs. But why?
In his recent book, Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell states that psychologists generally agree on the three primary factors that contribute to meaningful work: complexity, autonomy and a clear relationship between effort and reward.
Stripped of their psychological jargon, the concepts explain what most people need to function productively in the average workplace.
Complexity refers to work that is challenging, stimulating and demanding of a worker’s particular skills. Autonomy emerges when employees have sufficient input over how their work is controlled. A clear relationship between effort and reward simply means that a worker needs to be able to see the fruits of his labor.
Csikszentmihalyi’s study shows that the most common complaint — lack of complexity — demonstrates the need  for a more stimulating workplace; a lack of challenge or variety disengages the worker from the tasks at hand and leaves his skills unused.
On the other hand, the workplace squabbles that so often lower morale are caused by a lack of autonomy. Excess pressure, another determinant of an unhappy camper, also relates to autonomy and the organization of work flow.
Regardless of  Csikszentmihalvi’s findings, there’s not denying the fact that many US citizens are employed in jobs that aren’t particularly conducive to gleaning meaning from work. In an ever-pressing economic crisis, it’s hard to be picky about finding any job, much less one that complies with the three keys to workplace bliss.
However, taxing economic times only highlight the need for restructuring of individual jobs; not only is it possible to change the way jobs are designed in order to maximize their complexity, autonomy and effect-reward relationship within the confines of a growing economy, it is necessary for a vital workplace.
One study found that the lack of well-being in many occupations results in a 5-10 percent loss in the Gross National Product each year; this amount is significantly more than the economic losses due to the recession over the last year.
Perhaps in the shortterm, a massive restructuring of individual jobs would cause a decrease in productivity because of the mental and social adjustments needed to adapt to a new system of employment. But the benefits of making work stimulating for people would drastically increase productivity among employees.
Some jobs naturally follow this recipe for productivity. A university professor, for example, has the independence and authority to determine his curriculum, the challenge of educating a classroom of students who’d most likely rather be on Youtube and the ultimate reward of enriching young minds with information not readily found on Wikipedia.
The teaching profession is not the only such rewarding job, however. Cooks, engineers, taxi drivers, car mechanics — all of these jobs have the potential to be meaningful, as long as they provide challenges and allow for independence.
The main problem in the US workforce is that there are a large number of employments that don’t function this way. A factory worker might work 40 hours a week, where his primary task is feeding metal plates into a machine. In this kind of job, there is neither complexity, autonomy nor a relationship between effort and reward — there is only a surplus of free metal plates.
This kind of science is not merely of value to the sociologist or policymaker, but to every college student searching for a job or trying to discern a career path. During school and after graduation, surviving financially should be a primary concern, especially in today’s inauspicious job market.
But like any life-defining decision, choosing a major and an occupation has long-term consequences — which will last well beyond the current economic crisis.
Students should think hard about what vocation to choose. Would this job encourage autonomy, complexity and a clear relationship between effort and reward? Ultimately, happy workers help the economy.

This is depressing.  Why any editor would feel it’s their prerogative to reorder and rewrite anything, let along an OPINION piece, and without even talking to the writer, is beyond me.  I am glad I’ve graduated already, I don’t have to feel as embarrassed to call the Daily Trojan my school’s paper.  Why do the editors even have writers in the first place, when they clearly think they themselves can do vastly better?
And I agree with Eric, I doubt Daily Trojan policy applies when the writer has been disrespected to such a great degree as this, and he feels when reading the article that he can’t even claim his work as his own anymore.
It’s such a shame that these editors of DT tend to cut out the integrity of the writer. This is an OPINION section.
Shame you twice.
I used to work for the Daily Trojan and it appears that the editing has not improved. Such a shame. When the author puts in a great deal of time and effort in crafting a piece his words and ideas should be respected. Unfortunately it seems that the tendency of the editors is to rewrite (i.e. add content) rather than to actually edit. It seems disrespectful to drastically change a piece without contacting the author. Shame on you
“…it is Daily Trojan policy for writers to not post comments on their work, please stop.”
It doesn’t seem like it is “his” work…
Hello readers and writer,
Let’s talk about what happened and solve the issue properly. As the public editor (that means your representative, readers, not someone who controls editorial content) here, I hope you will shoot me an e-mail so we can talk, Max. Readers, if you’re so inclined, I would very much like to hear more from you after I have had a chance to speak with the editors involved in the changes made here. To any and all, I am always available at publiceditor@dailytrojan.com. Max, it is Daily Trojan policy for writers to not post comments on their work, please stop.
Keaton
Awful title as well….
The title of the article has no bearing on what the author is trying to say. Rule #1: If you are going to add a title you should at least read the piece, and if you are too stupid to understand the authors point maybe a job in editing isn’t such a great idea.
I have to agree with Max here. The fact that the DT feels that it has to add a cheesy “hook” is insulting to the intelligence of the readers. Worse yet, it seems that the author doesn’t even watch the show and never would have considered using such a meaningless example. This blatant and unnecessary rewriting is entirely unprofessional and the DT should apologize to the victim.
I find it funny that they changed the first sentence to be “If The Office teaches us anything, it’s that people don’t always like their jobs,” because that’s a pretty terrible way to start an article.
If what the writer of this article is stating is entirely true, I’m not sure I understand why the editor(s) needed to alter the original intent of the writer. This especially being an opinion piece, I’m don’t see any justification for this act.  Maybe the editor(s) can enlighten us on why they have taken such action.
Someone did not do their research.  Dr. Csikszentmihalyi left the University of Chicago over eight years ago.  He is now the Director of the Quality of Life Research Center at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, CA.
Couldn’t have said it better myself Matt. Well said. Speaking of “second-hand trash” as Matt has mentioned, I feel that it is MORE THAN BEFITTING to leave some of my own second-hand trash on this website. To the editor(s), as a token for your intelligently crafted contributions to this otherwise beautifully written article, I will be more than happy to leave a big bag of SHIT in front of your doorstep. Thank you.
I find it appalling that the editor(s) of this article found the need to transform the writer’s work into one of their own. Since when did writers invest their faith in editors to have their work ravaged, disfigured by the hands of others?
It’s a shame to find that the writer knows of these damages only AFTER the article is published for the world to see. It’s even more of an insult that the editors appear to think they know what the writer is trying to say, and insert snippets of secondhand trash that are so obvious it’s sad.
I sincerely hope the editor(s) of this article issue an official apology to the writer and explain to the readers why it is that the writer’s work was so conspicuously ruined. I further hope that the editor(s) have some consideration for the works of others by preserving them in their truest forms.
Editing does not entail infringing on the authenticity of another person’s work.
Don’t put words in another person’s mouth.
Awesome Max. Journalistic integrity is incredibly important.

As students pull out their rainboots and umbrellas, other LA County residents are pulling out their sandbags and tarps as the first major rainstorm of the season closes in.
An uncharacteristically strong October storm is sweeping through the state today, and though estimates vary, it’s likely the storm will drop at least half an inch of water in the downtown LA area tonight. According to the National Weather Service, the average amount of precipitation in LA in October is .37 inches.
But the main threat is to the Los Angeles-area foothills, particularly the areas affected by the Station Fire. With rainfall of up to four inches predicted authorities are bracing for the possibility of mudslides.
The storm struck Northern California morning, and the rain is now moving south and should hit Southern California tonight.

When the California Senate passed a law banning cell phone use while driving, citizens all over the state agreed that this was a sensible and well-reasoned law — that no one would ever, ever follow.
It’s like a law that forbids people from making bad eating choices. It’s good for us! It’s better for the planet! People will break it every day!
So now, a year after it was made illegal to operate a handheld device while driving, people are still only marginally respectful of the law. Or at least, they find it easy to justify breaking it.
There are a myriad of reasons. First, it’s rather difficult to enforce. Talking on your cell phone, unlike speeding, is a subtle breach of conduct and not necessarily obvious to other drivers. Sure, you could be talking on your cell phone, but maybe you are just scratching your neck for a really long time. Or maybe you just like to feel the smooth surface of the phone against your ear.
Another big problem facing the cell phone law is that many hands-free devices, which enable drivers to talk on the phone while driving legally, are obnoxious. Sure, now they’re mandatory accessories if you have a car and a cell phone and you want to use them at the same time.
But there was a time when Bluetooth headsets were used exclusively by jerks in expensive cars shouting out orders to their brokers while simultaneously ordering nonfat soy lattés. It’s not the ’90s any more, but it’s still hard to separate that image from the funny little earpieces we’re all supposed to have.
Perhaps most challenging for the cell phone law is that old habits die hard. Cell phones were such a novel concept when they emerged, no one thought to ban them while driving at first. The government gave drivers a little taste of forbidden fruit, and then took it away — but not until everyone got used to it.
(Imagine if marijuana had once been legal — making it illegal would have been like Prohibition all over again.)
Conscientious drivers who religiously use their hands-free headsets might disagree, but the law that talking on the phone while driving is more difficult to follow, than, say, the one that bans oral sex while driving.
Even the governor’s wife is having trouble following the law. Pictures surfaced Tuesday of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s wife, Maria Shriver, driving while talking on her cell phone.
There are two pictures from two different days. The fine for the first violation is $20, and the second violation is $50 — but Shriver was only caught by TMZ reporters, not the police.
Perhaps more relevant though is the scandal that should ensue. As the governor’s wife, doesn’t she have a special obligation to be an example for the rest of us?
Maybe.
But if we start looking on our government leaders to be paragons of law-abiding virtue, then we are looking in the wrong place.
The last thing anyone should do is take marital advice from, say, former Gov. Elliot Spitzer. Or ethics lessons from former Gov. Rod Blagojevich.  The list goes on.
And besides, maybe Maria wasn’t talking on the phone at all. She might just like the feel of the smooth surface against her ear.

OMG — This is the worst, most assumptively generalized article I have read in the last few years: To assume that people talking on their in-car systems “…used exclusively by jerks in expensive cars shouting out orders to their brokers while simultaneously ordering nonfat soy lattés,” is just such a cheap shot, it cannot be dignified.
Of course, then there’s the comedy relief (equally dumb): “Sure, you could be talking on your cell phone, but maybe you are just scratching your neck for a really long time. Or maybe you just like to feel the smooth surface of the phone against your ear.”  OMG, is that funny….wait I’m rolling on the floor so much I can’t reach the keyboard to comment further. But wait, folks,  the word “smooth” appears again: “And besides, maybe Maria wasn’t talking on the phone at all. She might just like the feel of the smooth surface against her ear.” Hmmm… what’s going on with the word “smooth” in this writer’s life?
…And then, how did we get two ultimate moral scofflaws in this piece, to wit: “The last thing anyone should do is take marital advice from, say, former Gov. Elliot Spitzer. Or ethics lessons from former Gov. Rod Blagojevich…”? What’s the reference?
‘Well look,’ to spake presidential, this “column” is all over the wall — Too bad “The Daily Trojan” isn’t physically printed in dart board form so one could have a few beers and snick a few darts onto pieces published… this one would collect more than a few bullseyes…

Children are forever in the news. Whether for their preternatural ability to say the darndest things under the gauze of anesthetic, or the fact that they keep popping out in record numbers (Octomom and Kate Gosselin look to be the most popular Halloween costumes this year), kid stories constantly pepper the news.
But with all the sound and fury surrounding celibrats in the types of gossip magazines best read (or used) on the toilet, more substantive issues have fallen by the wayside in the public spectrum.
First there was President Barack Obama’s continued support of the No Child Left Behind Act, which continues to leave children behind. Then, the budget cuts in already underfunded public schools across the country, which have left many districts with a severe deficit of teachers.
On Monday, Los Angeles activists brought another important issue to the table — the child welfare system.
A letter written by activists to US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius cited Sunday’s Los Angeles Times article that reported that between January 2008 and August 2009, at least 268 children in the Los Angeles County child welfare system died.
Of these deaths, 76 were homicides, 35 were accidents and 16 were suicides. Eighteen deaths were directly linked to caretaker neglect or abuse.
The director of the Los Angeles Country Department of Children and Family Services, Trish Ploehn, resonded to complaints of an unstructured system last week in typical Band-Aid-on-a-broken-leg fashion. Ploehn told the Times that it is “very rare for a child to die of abuse or neglect while in the care or under the supervision of DCFS.”
Rarity is not the issue here. It doesn’t matter that 268 deaths in 20 months seem dwarfed by the fact that as many as 12,000 children are recommended to the system each month.
What is important is the fact that the system is flawed enough to let 268 children die, most by unnatural causes.
The manner of death betrays the need for a complete overhaul of the child welfare system in Los Angeles.
Officials are already taking the necessary step to review specific cases in which it is obvious that the foster home’s conditions were unduly neglectful.
There is much more to be done.
The regretful statistics demonstrate that children are pulled from their unsatisfactory home lives, only to be placed in foster homes that are equally unsuitable. This indicates the need for a much more rigorous screening process for potential foster parents. The state also needs to allocate more money for the general social worker budget, so that the regular checkups that are already mandated can be made more frequent, and more thorough.
The ball is the county’s court — denying the deaths as rare or unrepresentative of system flaws is merely an excusatory attempt to overlook the need to reform. Infrastructural changes can be made by officials, but the welfare system as a whole cannot make big strides without a budget.
Throwing money at a situation won’t make it go away. But allocating money with an intent to reform will help.

For the third year in a row, USC earned a C+ on the Sustainable Endowments Institute’s College Sustainability Report Card, though officials question some of the report’s methods.
“Basically the survey is an oversimplification, trying to apply a standard metric to sustainability,” said Matthew Oden, USC’s sustainability manager. “It doesn’t really help in reality.”
Certified · Jonathan Kuo (left), Heidi Gensler and Sirish Nandyala, all doctoral students, look at the new, LEED-certified campus center. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
The College Sustainability Report Card gives individual grades for factors such as climate change and energy, food and recycling, green building and student involvement. These grades are averaged to produce the overall grade.
Oden said that rating systems like the College Sustainability Report Card often hold schools to standards that don’t necessarily apply to them.
Stanford, for example, has received recognition for its successful utilization of solar energy. Oden said that some people expect USC to do the same, but the school can’t because it is under contract with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
But Chryslyn Pais, a member of SEI’s research team, said campuses are not graded on standards that don’t apply.
“Every campus has different limitations and in some cases certain sustainability programs and commitments are not applicable to a school,” Pais said. “In these cases, this part of the grade is not factored into the average.”
Irrelevance is not the only qualm some officials have with the grading system. Oden said the ratings can often be inconsistent.
The new Ronald Tutor Campus Center, for example, will be LEED — Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design — certified,  meaning it met the group’s sustainability standards. But USC’s “green building” grade still fell from a B to a D on the 2010 report card.
“Our buildings will be of LEED caliber, but still our building grades went down,” Oden said.
Oden said there were many other areas the school improved in, even if they are not reflected by the report card.
“We have improved so much and in so many ways and a lot of people see USC as a leading green school,” he said. “It doesn’t seem reflective of our work, but no one is overly concerned about it.”
The grades are based entirely on information from public documents and on surveys the colleges fill out. Pais said the graders do not visit the school.
Even schools who received better grades take issue with parts of the grading system.
Nurit Katz, the campus sustainability coordinator at UCLA, which received a B, said the rating system puts too much emphasis on how finance is kept and how the schools manage their endowments.
“Our endowment is invested in mutual funds, and we don’t have a lot of discretion concerning where it goes,” Katz said. “It can be frustrating because we’re still doing so much for sustainability.”
But the SEI also isn’t the only group to rate schools based on green practices. The Sierra Club and a website called Greenopia are just two of the other groups measuring sustainability. The Sierra Club didn’t rate USC last year, and the most recent Greenopia rating gave the school one out of four for meeting between 40 and 50 percent of its grading criterion. The Princeton Review’s green rating system gave USC 90 out of 99 points, while UCLA received 88 points.
“Imagine getting an A from one professor and a B or a C from another based on the exact same work you did in a class,” Katz said. “[The ratings] are good because they bring focus to sustainability, but they’re not exactly consistent.”
Regardless of its recent C+ grade, Katz thinks Oden has put USC on the right track.
“He’s starting with these
less-established programs and the work he’s done is really impressive,” Katz said. “The grade shouldn’t matter. USC is moving along so fast.”

One word added to the GLBTA’s traditional t-shirts makes a world of difference.
The LGBT Ally Alliance distributed the shirts in front of Tommy Trojan Monday, an annual event that coincides with National Coming Out Month.
In past years, the t-shirts have read, “Gay? Fine by me.”
But this year, the Ally Alliance made a change. The new shirts read, “Gay marriage? Fine by me.”
The difference was also reflected in this year’s OUTList, published in the Daily Trojan last week. Students, faculty, staff and alumni were asked to sign if they supported marriage equality, whereas previously people signed to indicate their support for the LGBT community.
The change in focus comes after last year’s passing of Proposition 8, which overturned the California Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of same-sex marriage and restricts marriage to a union between a man and a woman. Prop 8 has been the subject of debate and protest since the election.
Ally Alliance’s shirts were distributed just a day after about 200,000 members of the national LGBT community descended on Washington to demonstrate for equal rights, and two days after President Barack Obama reiterated his intention to end the military’s “don’t ask don’t tell” policy. President Obama has also pledged his support in repealing the Defense of Marriage Act, which allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages.
The t-shirt distribution also, coincidentally, fell on the same day Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger approved a measure making May 22 a day of recognition of gay rights leader Harvey Milk.

A new speaker series from the USC Office of Religious Life is attempting to dismiss any perception that a successful legal career comes at the expense of a fulfilling life.
Hosted by the Gould School of Law, which also provides the pool of potential orators, the new “Spirit of Law” speaker series aims to bridge the gap between the academic experience and the personal experience of students and faculty at the university.
Legality · Andrew Post, a third year law student at the USC Gould School of Law, started the “Spirit of Law” speaker series this year. - Hide Kurokawa  | Daily Trojan
“Most students who come to law school really don’t know what they want to do — they’re told,” said Andrew Post, a third-year graduate student at Gould and the director of the series. “The goal is to become exposed to a discussion with very respectable members of the legal community for whom law is more than a job.”
The series was initiated after Post attended similar events presented by the Office of Religious Life last year, where different professors shared methods of incorporating a balance between career and personal life. Post, then in his second year, said those events inspired him to request that the Office start a law-focused version of the same program.
Varun Soni, dean of the Office of Religious Life and a California attorney himself, said he sees the value of such a program.
“When I was going to law school, I saw that there needed to be this forum addressing meaning, purpose, and identity within the context of the law,” Soni said. “It wasn’t discussed in the law classes, but it was definitely talked about outside of the classroom among the students.”
The series is based on the “What Matters to Me and Why” program that the office had established on campus, and the “Medicine for the Soul” offshoot focusing on medical professionals.
Ron Garet, a professor of law and religion and the first speaker in the series, said the format of these programs allowed students to learn about aspects of their future careers that they might not be learning in class.
“It provides an opportunity for students to hear a member of the faculty share his or her own responses to the difficult questions that we all ask,” Garet said. “Each speaker talks about how they find fulfillment in their legal work.”
The idea of the program was to give law students, who might be wrapped up in the stresses and expectations of their classes, a chance to examine the profession from a different point of view, Garet added.
“Many students enter law school worried about finding this satisfaction among the long hours and competition, and they begin to question its value and if they are contributing to the meaning of life. This program is designed to give that value to a legal career,” he said.
A number of students said they were happy for the opportunity to learn about the job from experienced professionals.
“This speaker series would be extremely beneficial to the law and pre-law students and others looking toward a profession related to law,” said Julia Riley, a freshman majoring in political science on the pre-law track. “It is really difficult to balance personal time with time devoted to an occupation — hearing firsthand experiences would offer some key advice to making it work.”
Jessica Ching, a sophomore majoring in political science, also on the pre-law track, added that the series would also help students decide if they want to continue studying law.
“Any time one is well-informed and takes advantage of resources available to them, they have better insight into the pathway and can make a better decision as to what they really want to do in life,” Ching said. “[The] series will give students exposure to knowledge that can indicate whether or not the career would be right for them.”
Though the program was designed specifically for law students, Post said he would encourage students from all academic backgrounds to attend.
“I want to encourage people from ‘nontraditional’ majors, such as myself — a computer science and applied math double major — to see law as being more than just a confinement to the courtroom,” Post said. “There is an apparent interest in exploring the meaning of life in the law, and I have high hopes that those who come to the series will find this meaning, purpose and identity.”
Soni added that the Office is looking for a combination of USC law professors and local attorneys from the LA region to fill speaker spots for the rest of this semester. Beginning in January 2010, he added, a new web page will be launched with a link for students to nominate speakers.

In support of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, this week’s installment of USC’s “Be Fit. Be Well.” program will feature a class on breast health.
The program, run by Recreational Sports, hosts a speaker each week to discuss health and wellness issues. This Wednesday, the class will focus on breast cancer and prevention techniques.
“It’s important that we all know what the newest and most current procedures are in order to stay healthy,” said Jennifer Siu, associate director of recreational sports.
Wednesday’s class will be led by Amelia Warwick, the nurse health advocate for USC Career and Protective Services.
Warwick has a long history of involvement with breast cancer issues. She volunteered in the education department of the American Cancer Association for six years, hosted a support group for women with breast cancer, helped provide low-cost mammograms to women and now works with employees at USC who are fighting breast cancer.
Having also seen two close friends battle breast cancer, Warwick said she is dedicated to spreading awareness and prevention methods — including among college students, who often think they’re too young to deal with breast health issues.
“Even though students might not be ready for some of the information for themselves yet, it is still worthwhile for them to come to [the class] because it does talk about breast health and the importance of getting exams, as well as the risk factors such as the genetics of breast cancer,” Warwick said.
Siu said breast cancer was chosen as the topic for a “Be Fit. Be Well.” class because, in a survey conducted last year, many people requested a class on breast health.
“When I talked to some of our health professionals, they wanted to make sure [breast cancer information] got out to students and also staff and faculty,” Siu said.
Although the average age of women with breast cancer is 55, Warwick said women as young as their 20s have had breast cancer. With one out of eight women diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, it is likely these issues will be important to many students in the future.
“It will all be put in a very positive light because, with early detection, the cure rates can be very high,” Warwick said. “But we still have to make sure we stay on top of this for ourselves and the women we love.”
Some students, however, said a class on breast health would have little relevance to them right now.
“I don’t think a lot of students think it’s an issue for us because we’re not in the age bracket,” said Julian Williamson, a junior majoring in international relations (global business).
But others, like Daniella Ginsburg, a junior majoring in neuroscience, agreed it was important for college-aged women to be informed about breast health.
“People don’t think that breast cancer can occur from younger ages, but it doesn’t only happen to older people,” Ginsburg said. “Even if it won’t affect them, they will still be able to educate other members of their family.”
Ginsburg, like Warwick, has already encountered breast cancer among those close to her.
“Because my mom had breast cancer and I saw what kind of a toll it took on her, and also how fortunate she was that she did catch it early … it made me so aware of how important it is to get tested early and examine yourself,” Ginsburg said. “If you do there is more hope for you.”
Great article!  Kudos!!!  Me being young myself (early 30s) it’s important to not only be fit but check regularly for any lumps, etc… up until a year ago I didn’t think that i was a candidate yet but a friend of mine went through breast cancer at any early age and it def scared me!  It’s important to donate this month… I’ve also chosen to invest in a breast cancer treatment.  Mentor Capital & Quantum Immunologics out of Tampa, FL are in FDA trials patent pending an immunotherapy treatment.  Chemo is such an aggressive and harsh treatment, after some of my fam went through it and watched their struggles it got me researching other methods.

The gay and Greek communities at USC need to build a working relationship to address the existing tension and lack of communication, a panel of gay students and alumni concluded Monday at the Gay & Greek Speak Out.
More than 45 students showed up to listen to alumni and current USC fraternity members share what it is like to be gay and in the Greek system. The panel event was run by the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center and the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Assembly — without the involvement of any Greek councils.

“Right now it’s an unspoken issue, but we need to open these channels of communication, and hopefully the Greek community will be more receptive to LGBT individuals,”  said Genevieve Flores, executive director of the GLBTA. “The Greek community needs to make it okay for individuals who are LGBT need to come out.”
Although Flores said the event touched on some of the difficulties facing lesbian and bisexual women in sororities, the main focus of the panel was to discuss the difficulty of being a gay male in the Greek system.
Panelist Stephen Anderson, a USC alumnus and a member of Delta Chi fraternity, said although fraternities were seeing more openly gay members, he had still witnessed homophobic behavior in his time at USC.
“I heard the term ‘faggot’ tossed around all the time,” Anderson said. “It’s a tough environment … I’ve found that there is a lot of misunderstanding on both sides.”
Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center, said both the LGBT and the Greek communities need to focus on facilitating a safe environment where LGBT students feel comfortable, without the fear of homophobic remarks or behavior.
“I don’t know if all people who are Greek understand the difficulties of being gay and Greek … So on both sides, there needs to be learning and understanding about these issues,” Vigil said.
As the politics of gay rights become increasingly visible — President Barack Obama recently brought the issue back to the national conversation by promising to repeal the military’s “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” laws as well as the Defense of Marriage Act — Flores said GLBTA is moving forward with the overall goals of promoting relevant LBGT issues and increasing acceptance of LGBT students on USC’s campus, through events like the panel.
The discussion included a focus on the panelists’ experiences with attending fraternity and sorority events with same-sex partners, and the discrimination they faced during the rush period.
Steven Philp, a senior majoring in creative writing and international relations who was a panelist at the event, said gay members of the Greek community still felt a stigma because the topic is considered somewhat taboo.
“The biggest challenge in the Greek community is that it has a heterosexist structure,” said Philp, who described himself as an openly gay member of Beta Theta Phi. “I never brought a guy to my own invite, as I was very discouraged, and you definitely feel a little isolated.”
A number of students who attended the event said they were disappointed that Panhellenic and IFC did not contribute to the event and hoped to hear more discussion about being a lesbian or bisexual girl in a sorority in the future.
“It’s not talked about … It’s probably harder to be a lesbian in a sorority than it is to be gay in a fraternity,” said Mary Walsh, a current Panhellenic sorority member. “The Greek system is very big on heteronormativity.”
The event was prompted by an incident last semester, when Isaac Ahn, a senior majoring in English and communication, wrote a letter to the Daily Trojan accusing the Greek system of homophobia and discrimination, according to Flores.
That letter gave GLBTA the idea of holding a panel discussion to explore some of the subtler aspects of Greek life, especially for gay or lesbian members.
Philp said although IFC and the Panhellenic Council seemed open to interacting with the LGBT community, there is a need for equality education for individual chapters.
IFC President Nick Hamada, who attended the event, said IFC encouraged all fraternity members to participate.
“We are an open community, so there is overlap between our communities,” Hamada said. “They are trying to increase dialogue between the communities to bring up these important issues.”
Hamada said IFC plans to work on improving communications about these issues with individual chapters, as well as looking at aspects of the rush process.
The panel discussion, which was followed by a question and answer session with attendees, ended with a sense of general consensus that the communities have to make an effort to work together.
“Our goal is just to educate ourselves, as the different communities don’t know that much about each other,” Flores said. “We wanted to provide a window into both worlds.”
was considering
Don, you seem to have a homophobic agenda…There is no “radical gay agenda” going on in this case.  The LGBT community is simply trying to bridge the communication and education gaps that exist today on campus between the gay and Greek communities.  Are you saying that the “traditional values” of the Greek system did not include segregation? Excluding gays is not at all different from discriminating against race.  It seems that you are rather ignorant about the topic.  We as a community are not trying to change anything, but instead trying to secure that we should be treated the same regardless of sexual orientation.  Homosexual, bisexual, and trans-gender students who feel like being a part of the Greek community do so for their own personal reasons, just like heterosexual students.  I guarantee you there is not a gay movement to change the Greek system in effect.  You are bringing in topics that don’t really relate at all to what is actually being discussed in the article.  Your views alone are evidence that the  Greek community is not “well enough” and that more education and communication must take place in the future.
To put in my own two cents, I am currently a Freshman that is considering rushing in the fall.  I am not what you would be a stereotypical gay man.  I have many straight male and female friends and would love to be in a society with a great brotherhood (whether they be gay, bisexual, or straight) such as a fraternity.  I would in no way intend to change the system, but instead seek understanding that I am a person like everyone else.  I have no “radical gay agenda” and know no one else that has one.  I do, however, know another bisexual freshman who was accepted into a fraternity, but is afraid to let his sexuality be exposed.  Why should ANYONE fear exclusion from any organization in the world, especially America,  because they are different?  Exactly. They should not.  Being in support of the equal treatment of an individual does not make you gay, nor does it even mean you support homosexuality.  It shows that you are an educated person that can see that we are all in fact the same and should be treated that way.
Just an afterthought…WHY would a practicing gay want to even join a traditional, heterosexual fraternity, unless it was for the express purpose of changing it?!?
A personal experience I had which involved a homosexual member of my fraternity will hopefully prove very instructive to this topic: Nobody knew Ron was gay when he first joined the fraternity, but several of us eventually found out…even though we told nobody else because we knew it could only cause problems for him & he valued the friendships he had there enough that he was willing to keep his homosexuality a non-issue, so he could continue his friendships and remain in the fraternity!! So everyone stayed quiet about the issue and Ron eventually went his own way and lost contact with most in the chapter members (myself included). When others learned of his premature death (under mysterious circumstances) at a subsequent class reunion, very few even suspected it was probably AIDS-related and nobody mentioned that possibility, since it couldnt be substantiated one way or another. Those who knew him well enough to know whether or not it might be AIDS-related never brought it up…out of respect for Ron.
If “don’t ask, don’t tell” is good enough for the military to function, then why would it not be good enough for a social group with traditional values like a fraternity or sorority to function as well? If someone’s homosexuality is such a major issue that they wouldnt be able to function well in a heterosexual fraternity/sorority, why would they not start or join a similar group for homosexual members or at least those who DON’T CARE about sexual preference? To join a traditional Greek organization with the intent of pushing for “acceptance” of how you choose to live is nothing more than blatant political activism…and often brings with it other elements of the radical gay agenda!!
Lastly, for those who believe homosexuals are one of the most “oppressed” groups, try talking to an EX-HOMOSEXUAL and learn some of their experiences of ostracism and harassment that they endured at the hands of ACTIVE, PRACTICING GAYS!! I’ve known some personally and they have some true horror stories to tell…
Thanks for your input JR…I am not talking about something as blatant as the GLBTA issuing edicts that mandate gay weddings, transsexual celebrations, etc, but rather a gradual, incremental process of social (and sometimes legal) actions, such as those that eventually brought about “integration” of fraternity-sponsored dances at some college campuses, wherein private fraternities were forced to allow gay couples to dance at fraternity functions (to site just one example)!! As a fraternity member who has observed a gradual, incremental imposition of the radical gay agenda at numerous college campuses across the U.S., I can assure you this is not something we want to see take place at USC…
I’m happy to hear that these two communities are beginning to open discussion.  As an alum of the Greek system at USC, you can’t deny the fact that membership across these organizations include LGBT students who are just looking to enrich their collegiate experience like any other person.  It’s important, especially in academia, to practice an open understanding and a willingness to learn what is different from you.  Unfortunately, I feel that the Greek system might be the last place where tolerance for the LGBT community is practiced as it is so much a community centered on heterosexual roles.
And Don, never in my experience as a Greek did the LGBT community try and dictate the way IFC or Panhellenic was run.  This article talks upon “building a working relationship” and addressing “existing tension and lack of communication” between these two communities.  With regards to your statement of LGBT students pushing their agenda on the Greek system, are you speaking from experience as a member of a Fraternity/Sorority as well?
The panel was designed to discuss the same issues you brought up in your post, and perhaps both of us could have learned something about each side if we both attended.
GREEK COMMUNITY TO GLBTA: Dont call us…we’ll call you, but not anytime soon!!
Why on earth would the USC fraternity system want to open themselves to a group which is looking for an opportunity to DICTATE how fraternity life will be governed?!? This is not a matter of being “accepted”…the agenda here is to incrementally force “gay rights” down the throats of heterosexuals!! Once “gay marriage” is legalized in California, the GLBTA will be pushing for fraternity-sanctioned gay wedding ceremonies, special events for “transsexuals” and other such key proposals that are part and parcel of the radical gay agenda!!
Start your own gay fraternity system and leave well enough alone…
where are the comments?!??!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? WHERE ARE THEY!?
