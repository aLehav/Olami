What would you do to get your life back? Would you steal it? The Losers would.
For the special operations team codenamed “the Losers,” it was an average mission — survey an arms dealer’s Bolivian compound for an air strike and come back home. When its CIA handler Max (Jason Patric) betrays it, though, the team is left for dead.

On the CIA’s death list, without any prospects but with revenge on their minds, the Losers wait for a plan. Enter Aisha (Zoë Saldana), a rogue CIA operative with the funds and resources to track down Max and get the team off the death list.
Based on a Vertigo comic series written by Andy Diggle and illustrated by Jock, director Silvain White’s The Losers is a fast-paced, kinetic action film with an intelligent script not usually found in Hollywood blockbusters. Unlike a lot of other films from the same genre, The Losers isn’t about big explosions or clichéd plots that are only meant to set up fight scenes. Instead, it is a strong character piece with a great revenge plot that just happens to feature some remarkably well-done fight scenes.
This is the kind of movie where big-time heists and spy conspiracies come together through a filter of fights, chases and style. Imagine a cross between Ocean’s Eleven and Ronin.
While it takes a few liberties with the source material, the film adaptation of The Losers is remarkably close to the original graphic novels. Scenes are lifted straight from the pages of the comic, right down to dialogue and framing. Jock’s art comes to life on the big screen, literally — he provides some framing artwork for the credits. The comic was a storyboard for the big budget action film and proves to be a natural translation into celluloid.
And as for resemblence to the comic, these actors are the Losers. At first it would seem like the characters are clichés: There’s the pilot, Pooch (Columbus Short), the talkative hacker Jensen (Chris Evans), the silent sniper, Cougar (Óscar Jaenada) and the no-nonsense second-in-command, Rogue (Idris Elba). Each character is thoroughly fleshed out, however, and their interactions are filled with subtle hints of friendship and familiarity.
Each character also gets a moment to shine. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays the team’s leader, Clay, with a wonderful mix of a commanding presence and laid-back, casual gruffness. Although he only has a few lines, Jaenada’s physical language is deeply nuanced, and his casualness in every situation is endearing and cool.
Another great character is Pooch, a family man torn from his wife because of Max’s manipulations. It’s a tough role to play, but Short nails it.
The standout character, however, has to be Jensen, with his nonstop jokes, garishly funny shirts and penchant for bemoaning the team’s bad luck.
As Aisha, Saldana does a phenomenal job of balancing danger and sexiness. Her violent side is a bit toned down, but she is no shrew in the film’s many action scenes. Her romantic subplot feels forced, but to her credit, Saldana pulls it off very well.
One aspect of the film that falters is the editing during the action scenes. Although White stages the fight scenes well, his occasional dips into Zack Snyder-style slow motion are distracting and detract from otherwise well-done set pieces.
White sticks with a rock-heavy soundtrack for the film, and it usually works. Some moments, such as a chase scene that uses Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believing,” fall a bit flat, but don’t spoil the mood. At times, the music is a little too heavy in the sound mix, but luckily, it is not during scenes with much dialogue.
The film’s main problem is its villain. The comic’s Max is an enigmatic, never-seen figure with very political goals. Here, the politics are toned down and Max becomes a visible, talkative bad guy. Patric is wonderfully affable, but compared to the menacing villain of the graphic novel, the film version of Max falls short. Since he’s been depoliticized, the main scheme is altered and, ultimately, is a bit too sci-fi and out-there for the movie.
Despite these problems, The Losers is still one of the most entertaining films of the year thus far. With its smart script, respect for the source material and brilliant cast, the film comes together perfectly.
In a year where a lot of elite special forces movies are coming out, The Losers proves unique, and most of all, fun.
I never read the comic book, but I thought that Jason Patric as Max was a genuinely amusing villain and a better one than in most comic book movies. His jokes were kind of hit and miss, but the persona was perfectly douchey.
I didn’t necessarily feel like every character had a moment to shine though. When you’re dealing with an ensemble cast, it’s almost inevitable that some characters get reduced to stereotypes, like Cougar’s character did not really establish any semblance of a personality.
Either way, it bares mentioning that this movie proves the postulate that Zoe Saldana is the most beautiful woman on the planet.

For the No. 1 USC women’s water polo team, strong starts have become essentially habit as of late. But during Saturday afternoon’s matchup at No. 2 Stanford, however, something appeared radically different.
Net minded · The USC defense struggled at times during its 7-6 overtime loss to Stanford, giving the Cardinal opportunities to score. - Sunil Mural | Daily Trojan 
During Saturday’s showdown with Stanford, the only team to defeat USC this season, the Women of Troy got off to a fast start once again. But unlike in such previous contests, turnovers and inopportune plays derailed their efforts in route to a 7-6 heartbreaking overtime loss at the hands of the Cardinal.
“We’ve been more committed to stopping the counterattack,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “In this game, we did not do that.”
If Vavic were to start pointing fingers, defense and careless passing wouldn’t be bad places to start.
Despite an early goal by Stanford to put USC in an immediate hole, the Women of Troy reeled off four consecutive goals to build a 4-1 lead midway through the second period.
But even with such an advantage, sloppy play on behalf of the offense put a great deal of pressure on the USC defense, and the Cardinal capitalized on such mistakes to score two late goals, bringing its halftime deficit to just one.
“We had an opportunity to go up 5-1 with an extra man opportunity, but we got careless with the ball,” Vavic said. “That momentum swing right there really hurt us.”
Following Stanford’s late second quarter surge, the Women of Troy found it much harder to break away in the second half of the contest as neither team lead by more than one goal.
Facing such a strong opposition, USC nearly lost in regulation before junior two-meter Kristen Dronberger scored off a rebound to knot the game up at six to force overtime.
But in the extra period, USC would once again have difficulty capitalizing on the offensive end and, as a result, would eventually lose on a shot by driver Kelly Eaton that snuck past senior goalie Tumua Anae in the final minutes.
“We had a chance to win the game in the overtime,” Vavic said. “We had an extra man opportunity, but we just didn’t covert.”
Because of such an inability to execute when it counted the most, the loss ended the team’s 18-game winning streak, but more importantly gave the Cardinal the regular season conference title and top seed in next week’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament scheduled to be held at UCLA’s newly pristine Spieker Aquatics Center.
On Friday, the Women of Troy had more luck against San Jose State, building an early 4-2 lead and coasting to a 14-5 victory.
If the Women of Troy expect to take home the conference crown and position themselves for a run at an NCAA championship, it’s essential they get back to the basics like they did against San Jose State.
“There are many positives even if we didn’t play as well as we could have,” Vavic said. “We created numerous opportunities and we had opportunities to win. No question.”

It’s midnight on a Sunday as I write my very last column of the semester from a computer at a hostel in Prague. Only at this time of night can I avoid the dirty looks I’d normally get for commandeering the sole machine with Internet access. On a computer without Microsoft Office, Google Docs has become my best friend, despite an archaic dial-up connection speed and periodic warnings of being unable to save my work.
But if there’s anything I’ve learned this weekend, it’s that when life gives you lemons, you’ve got to learn how to make lemonade.
Rewind to Friday afternoon. I was checking my e-mail and reading my daily news alerts on a computer at my hostel in Pisa, Italy, when two women entered through the main reception doors. At this point, it had been two weeks into my spring break trip through Europe, and I was looking forward to finally going back to London — even if it did mean taking finals.
As I read about the problems caused by the eruption of the Icelandic volcano, I overheard the women — who turned out to be from London — asking if they could stay another night because their flight had been canceled. Though I felt bad about their misfortune, I secretly rejoiced that my own flight was on Monday, far enough into the future that the ash would not be a hinderance. In less than 48 hours, however, my naïve belief that I would be spared from the weather dissipated at the click of a mouse.
From Pisa, my group and I made our way to Florence by train. My time in the city known for housing Michelangelo’s “David” remained unmarred until about 1:30 p.m. on Saturday, when we got wind that the ash was spreading and airlines were canceling additional flights, including ours to London.
A cursory check of our e-mails resulted in finding one from the airline telling us that we could either apply for a refund or reschedule for a later flight.
Needless to say, the amount of available flights for later that week were minimal at best. We still held out hope that we could somehow make it back to London before our first exams. If we took a train to Paris and then the Channel Tunnel to London, we would be OK. We quickly packed all of our belongings in case there was a train that left immediately.
My friend and I were the first pair to rush to the train station with our Eurail passes in hand, hoping to make it to the front of the line before all the tickets were sold out. The rest of my group stayed at the hostel to be close to an Internet connection in case of any updates on the situation.
With only three ticket windows open at the station and an hour before closing, the line, which wrapped around the room in coils, moved at a rate slower than it was growing. Determined to speak with an actual person, however, we took to the tail and crossed our fingers.
But after about five minutes my legs started to feel wobbly and my brain started to flash images of the worst-case scenarios.
I wouldn’t make it back in time to take my finals, so I would have to try and book another place to stay. But all of the places that I could afford were taken. For an indefinite number of days I would swipe my credit card to pay for expenses, only to be maxed out before I could leave. I would ruin my credit, not be able to get a job in the future and wind up a poor beggar on the streets of Pisa.
To quell my apocalyptic fears, I left my friend to hold our spot and made my way to the front of the line with the intention of ambushing the first English speaker about how they were getting home.
The first two men I met were Irish and had been waiting for more than an hour to buy tickets. They were in Florence for the weekend on business and were also trying to get tickets to Paris, where a friend of theirs had already reserved Eurostar trains to take them back home.
I had to restrain my desires to ingratiate myself in their presence, hoping to attract an offer to go with them. However, they rejected my friendly advances, but promised to update me on their status when they actually bought tickets.
Another pair of English-speakers stumbled away from the ticket window with papers in hand. Clearly distressed and annoyed, they had bought tickets to Paris through Zurich for 250 euros ($334.68) without any further reservations to get back to London.
Slightly reassured, I headed back to my friend in line where I heard the whisperings of worried French girls regretting their last-minute decision for a weekend getaway. In broken French, I attempted to converse with them. They were trying to get tickets to anywhere in France, hoping to make it back before their own final exams.
As horrible as it sounds, it was reassuring to know we weren’t the only ones stranded in the city.
About 45 minutes later, the Irish men that I met walked toward us with their tickets in tow. They had only been able to get a hold of first class tickets to Paris, which cost them 250 euros each. In other words, we either had to deal with the skyrocketing prices for transportation back to London or wait a week for new flights to open up.
Before we could even reach a decision, an official cut off the line and reported that all tickets to France were sold out until Thursday — not exactly what we wanted to hear.
My group spent the remaining two days of our spring break in Internet cafes, frantically trying to rebook our flights, only to hear that all were cancelled. Every hour of every day yielded a new udpate.
Flights cancelled until Monday at 1 p.m. Airlines sending up test flights. Flights cancelled until Wednesday at 1 p.m. Airports opening up runways. Another volcanic eruption. Flights cancelled until Friday at 1 p.m.
Giving up on trying to make it back on time, we just wanted to get home.
At one point, we even considered renting a car and taking a road trip from Italy to London. But as much as we would like to say we were the first to think of this brilliant idea, we weren’t. According to the front desks, every AVIS and Hertz car in the entire country had already been rented out. The chances of getting a group of five back to England were quickly diminishing.
A mixture of disappointment, panic and desperation set in as we sat down for lunch. Maybe we could check back at the train station? Even an 18-hour bus ride started to seem appealing.
But with all the trains to Paris and Brussels fully booked until the end of the week, buses were no better of an option. We stared at the map for a good 15 minutes, trying to figure every roundabout route we could. Budapest, anyone? As out of the way as that sounds, when I learned that my rebooked flight was cancelled, any sort of movement seemed appealing.
In the end, we all split up. One of us managed to get a flight from Venice to Liverpool and a bus to London. Another got a train to Zurich and a flight from there to London. A third waited for a special train to open up from Florence to Paris and bused it back to London. And a friend and I hopped on a train to Budapest with plans to go to Prague after.
It was almost fate that I had already booked a roundtrip flight to Prague for the coming weekend. I only had to make it there before the return flight back to London on Tuesday.
When I started spring break, I could have never predicted where I would end up.
It’s weird to think that around the same time last year, I was studying at Leavey Library and getting ready for finals at USC. My biggest worry wasn’t about finding a place to crash for the night or where I was going to be the next day, but about writing essays and finishing up classes.
One of the last e-mails I read before hopping on the train to Budapest was from our study abroad program adviser telling us not to worry about tests. They were aware of the situation, and finals would be rescheduled.
In retrospect, it sounds unbelievable when I say that an Icelandic volcano disrupted my two and a half week spring break across Europe, forcing me to skip my finals and extend my travels.
Only in a life across the pond.

The fact of the matter is that you are receiving an education in a city whose municipal government green-lights plans to cordon off nearly three blocks of downtown for a street festival celebrating grilled cheese sandwiches. And whether you’re proud or ashamed, you’re probably not surprised.
For more than six hours Saturday — not including the significant set-up and clean-up time that was surely necessary before and after the event — The 1st 8th Annual Grilled Cheese Invitational monopolized the stretch of Beaudry Avenue between Fourth and Sixth streets. The open-air festival boasted cooking competitions, highly sought-after bite-sized samples of basic grilled cheese sandwiches, multiple food vendors purveying their gourmet interpretations of the staple from trucks and tents and various kitschy, cheese-themed diversions (e.g., “curd verse,” the event’s unique brand of cheese poetry).
Guests could save $5 off the $15 day-of entry fee if they paid for admission in advance, but the apparent consensus among newcomers to the festival — whether they planned ahead or waited to pay until arriving — was that they expected more for their money. The price of admission guaranteed the payer little more than access to streets and sidewalks that were made off-limits to non-paying citizens for the afternoon.
Tillamook, the event’s main corporate sponsor, was out promoting in full force: Cubes of cheddar of variant sharpness, sample-sized grilled cheese finger sandwiches (disappointingly, the only free grilled cheese sandwiches available within the Invitational’s confines) and all manner of promotional buttons and pins were distributed freely by the Tillamook staffers working the event.
Curiously, a select handful of Tillamook employees have apparently embarked on a nationwide crusade to introduce America to the company’s Tillamook Cheese Baby Loaf. They’re crossing the country as a part of something called the “Loaf Love Tour,” making appearances at grocery stores, farmers markets and the occasional Air Force Base commissary, guided only by the vaguely plausible mission statement on the Tilamook website “to get shreds, slices and loaves of tasty Tillamook Cheese into people’s mouths.”
Lines were comparably long for free samples provided by event sponsors like Izze sparkling juice and for food available for purchase, such as the now-famous Grilled Cheese Truck that has cultivated a sizeable 15,000 followers on Twitter.
Campanile, a posh restaurant on South La Brea, turned out to the event to offer $2 servings of grilled cheese sandwiches that cost $15 or more when ordered in-house. The restaurant’s unique preparation of the classic comfort food involved homemade mustard, caramelized onions and gruyere cheese sandwiched between perfectly buttered and crunchy panini bread. Especially when judged against Tillamook’s mass-produced nibbles of inadequately melted pepper jack and bland slices of wheat, Campanile’s approach was probably the best taste and the best value available at the invitational.
To compound the disappointment of entering the premises not to find a no-holds-barred, all-you-can eat smorgasbord, spectatorship at the actual cooking competition was restricted to a select handful of judges.
Regular guests were inexplicably prohibited from getting too close to the cooking showdown, where professional and amateur cooks alike prepared grilled cheese sandwiches in competitions ranging from “Missionary Position,” a category which limited participants to the use of standard
bread, standard butter and standard cheese, to “Kama Sutra,” where competitors were permitted more imaginative varieties of the same basic ingredients plus additional components — so long as the interior of the sandwich is at least 60 pecent cheese.
For many people who conceded to spending their Saturday afternoon at a grilled cheese festival, a big part of the allure was the prospect of watching the cooking competition. Keeping regular grilled cheese enthusiasts from even watching the highly touted competition seemed directly contrary to the event’s apparent egalitarian leanings, especially as suggested by the Invitational’s brochures featuring vaguely communist imagery of a hand rising up from the
L.A. skyline to hoist up a grilled cheese sandwich, and a tagline of “Bread — Butter — Cheese — Victory!” that’s more than slightly reminiscent of the Bolshevik cry of “Peace, Land, Bread!”
By hosting the Grilled Cheese Invitational for eight consecutive years,  Los Angeles is making a very conspicuous effort to continue promoting an image of a Downtown that is at once quirky, eccentric and — if not alive — at least not dead.
Construction-heavy redevelopment projects are advancing in time with similarly heavy-handed rebranding efforts that seek to infuse Downtown with character.
It’s telling that Los Angeles’ company in hosting this sort of event includes our colorful neighbors to the north and the city widely acknowledged to be the most eccentric in the nation. Northern California regional competitions have been hosted in both Oakland and San Francisco, and Austin, Tex. — a city whose cultural eclecticism and independent spirit somehow prevent its trademarked slogan of “Keep Austin Weird” from becoming ironic — has welcomed the Grilled Cheese Invitational within its city limits for two years running.
With new buildings springing up on the Downtown skyline seemingly every few weeks, it’s beyond question that Los Angeles is properly investing in the physical aspects of community revitalization. But to more fully breathe life into the area’s cultural scene, fresh attractions are necessary to draw people into the heart of the city — after all, culture is just as vital to revitalization as concrete, and no one will come to admire new architecture without the allure of new adventure.
Although Los Angeles is seeking to infuse character and life into an area that many feel is sorely lacking in both, an overly commercialized event like the highly self-conscious and corporate-dominated Grilled Cheese Invitational isn’t the way to do it. If you have money to burn and aren’t in the mood to melt your own cheese and toast your own bread, however, keep your eyes peeled for next year’s Grilled Cheese Invitational — in keeping with the event’s purposeful cutesiness, it will almost certainly be called The 1st 9th Annual Grilled Cheese Invitational.
I know you’re learning all this journalism stuff in college, kiddo, and where better to make mistakes (and hopefully learn from them) than at a college paper? But your lede is so. damn. clunky. With really awkward transitions. A rule I learned in J-school and stuck to for more than a decade of working at a major newspaper: K.I.S.S. = Keep it simple, stupid.  And you needed some quotes from real people/event-goers. You’ve got the meat of the story, just need to clean it up a bit.
“The fact of the matter is that you are receiving an education in a city whose municipal government green-lights plans to cordon off nearly three blocks of downtown for a street festival celebrating grilled cheese sandwiches. And whether you’re proud or ashamed, you’re probably not surprised.”
The area the event was held in is actually a working production facility.  No public streets were blocked off, and the city of Los Angeles did not sponsor the event.  Please check your facts before critiquing.

When Andrea Edoria was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm at age 3, she spent six months at Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.
Fifteen years later, Edoria, who has fully recovered, is a spokesperson for CHLA — and a future Trojan.
Good cause · Shiny Toy Guns performed a concert on Friday as part of Sigma Chi’s Derby Days. Proceeds were donated to CHLA. - Photo courtesy of Sigma Chi 
Through her work with CHLA, Edoria connected with her dream school, USC. Specifically, she connected with the Sigma Chi fraternity, which raised more than $50,000 for the Children’s Miracle Network at CHLA last year during its annual Derby Days philanthropy. Derby Days, which consists of a series of activities and a concert, typically raises more money than most other fraternity philanthropies combined. Admission to the concert typically costs $20 to $25 and the fraternity also collects funds from corporate sponsors.
According to Lisa Coleman, assistant director of the Children’s Miracle Network at CHLA, most of the money goes toward meeting the needs of families with ill children — families like Edoria’s.
Edoria met members of Sigma Chi for the first time last year, when she was invited to a barbecue. She was asked to speak at Derby Days to recount her experiences as a young child battling illness at CHLA. She has since been in constant contact with members of the fraternity.
“I’ve met these [Sigma Chi] boys on different occasions, and they’re really good guys at heart,” Edoria said. “They’re really supporting a good cause.”
For Edoria, who just recently committed to USC, working with Sigma Chi is just the beginning of her relationship with USC.
“It’s like a dream come true,” she said.
Edoria will be studying journalism at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism. She said she is very excited to become a Trojan and is grateful for the support she has received from members of Sigma Chi.
“Since I was about 7 or 8 years old, I have always wanted to write. When I came across USC, I knew that was where I wanted to go,” she said.
Though she officially becomes a Trojan in the fall, Edoria said she already feels like part of the Trojan family thanks to her relationship with Sigma Chi.
“I definitely feel welcome,” she said.
Although new restrictions from the Interfraternity Council forced Sigma Chi to limit the length of Derby Days this year, Stephen Lindgren, a member of Sigma Chi and one of the chairs of Derby Days, said the fraternity still had high hopes for the amount of money they could raise.

USC’s Keck School of Medicine jumped five spots on the U.S. News & World Report 2010 list of the nation’s best medical schools, thanks in part to the school’s increase in research and in National Institute of Health grants.
The school’s move from the 39th to the 34th ranking in top medical schools is the greatest advance of any medical school in one year, according to Keck Dean Carmen Puliafito.
“It’s a reflection of the quality that is being recognized that is going on at the medical school,” Puliafito said.
Robert Morse, director of data research at U.S. News, said Keck’s movement is largely because of its increase in NIH grants over the last year.
NIH grants are given to advance research in the medical field.
“In this particular ranking, because the NIH grants are very important, it’s a key reason why schools move,” Morse said.
Focusing on research and applying for grant applications has been a big focus for Keck during the past two years, Puliafito said.
“Since I’ve been here, our sponsored research programs have grown by almost 30 percent,” Puliafito said. “We were very successful for organizing applications for organizing NIH grants. We were also able to get some very large cancer grants.”
The rankings are a key factor for any potential medical student looking at schools to apply for, but Morse said he doesn’t anticipate the new ranking will affect admissions because Keck is already selective.
“Our rankings haven’t made them more or less difficult to get into,” Morse said. “They reject 95 percent of the applications; it’s very difficult to get into.”
Puliafito said the rankings serve more to recognize the effort that has been put into making Keck a quality medical school.
Some students like Tyler Vestal, a sophomore majoring in psychology and biology who plans to apply for medical school next year, said they still consider the rankings when thinking about what medical school they want to attend.
“I wouldn’t say it’s the top factor, but it’s certainly an indicator of where you’re going to get a good education,” Vestal said. “You can’t personally know how good each school is, so these rankings really tell me how Keck compares to the other medical schools.”

A protest ended with shoving in the offices of Bovard Auditorium on Friday, when students attempted to deliver a letter to the provost’s office on behalf of USC University Hospital workers who feel the hospital administration has engaged in union-busting tactics.
Taking a stand · Amee Chew, a graduate student studying American studies, spoke at the protest against the hiring of the Weissman Group. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Tension has been growing at the University Hospital for the past few months, with union elections approaching. The elections have already been postponed numerous times, but are now slated for May. At the elections, 685 hospital workers will vote whether to keep their current union, switch unions or go without a union all together.
Friday’s protest was organized by members of Student Activists for a Beloved Community after several hospital workers attended an SABC meeting about a month ago and voiced concerns with USC Hospital’s hiring of the Weissman Group, an Ohio-based consulting firm with an alleged history of union-busting.
Mitchell Creem, CEO of the USC University Hospital and USC Norris Cancer Center, said the Weissman Group was hired after members of the Service Employees International Union decided to form a new union. He said the firm has been coaching administrators on how to handle discussions with employees in the weeks leading up to the union elections.
“The Weissman Group was brought in as a result of an election the employees organized themselves,” Creem said. “We have a legal obligation to make sure our employees are informed. All we’re doing is telling our employees what their options are.”
But Dinorah Williams, a labor representative with the California Nurses Association who attended Friday’s protest, said the Weissman Group has used intimidation, one-on-one meetings and false promises in an attempt to convince employees to vote non-union in May’s elections.
“[Hospital administration is] spending a lot of money on PR, on fliers, on pictures, to make it seem like they’re really there for their employees,” Williams said. “But without a union, an employee’s job is at will and can be terminated at any time without notice.”
Williams said she believes the Weissman Group was “hired to teach hospital administration how to watch us, to anticipate what our next move is, to convince nurses that they don’t need union representation.”
Williams and other hospital workers at the protest also claimed the University Hospital is spending tuition money on this endeavor.
“If you go on [the Weissman Group’s] website, you’ll see all these links to how successful they’ve been at preventing unions,” said Diane Hirsch-Garcia, a worker at the hospital who attended the protest. “Typically, these firms cost $5,000 a worker. That’s easily millions of dollars, just to keep unions out.”
The letter to the administration, which student protesters read aloud Friday, said, “[We] do not spend money, take loans and incur debts so that workers will be mistreated. Spending our money to interfere with the choices and lives of employees of USC must stop.”
But Creem said it was the hospital’s revenue, generated from the services it provides, that was footing the bill, adding, “There’s nowhere near that kind of money being spent on this consulting group.”
Norman Weissman, president and founder of the Weissman Group, also denied this allegation.
“There are a lot of things being said that are so far from the truth that I don’t even understand why they say it,” Weissman said. “There’s no millions of dollars. Not even close. There’s not tuition money going toward this. This is paid for by the hospital.”
The protest, which began at noon, ended when members from 15 different student organizations filed into Bovard Auditorium to read a letter of protest aloud in the provost’s office.
Students were asked to leave the office. At one point, Jessi Quizar, a first-year graduate student studying American studies, was shoved. Department of Public Safety officers and Associate Dean of Students Patrick Bailey arrived to speak with the students outside. They said that although it is OK for students to protest, those protests cannot interrupt university business.
Creem said he did not mind that there was a protest, but he believes it was based on false information.
“The fact that there’s a protest is fine. This is an academic environment. I’m just disappointed that this opinion comes without much fact about what is going on,” Creem said.
According to Creem, there are approximately 685 employees currently a part of SEIU, about 700 employees in the California Nurses’ Association and more than 1,200 employees not affiliated with a union at all.
Why does the article neglect to mention WHO did the shoving?  It was a staff member in the provost’s office who shoved students without provocation.  No students participated in physical violence.
Why did the editors of the Daily Trojan decide to take this out — and actually resort to the passive voice?  You aren’t owned by the university… are you?
Incidentally, was Tucker Reed even at the protest that he is reporting on?  The person taking notes, getting quotes, and doing the leg work was certainly not  Tucker.
What the hell kind of headline is this?  A critique of the students before the paper even tells you what the protest is about?  The administration’s response before you even get to hear what the students have to say?  I thought this was an independent student newspaper, not some mouthpiece for the administration.
Of *course* the administration is going to call the protests misguided.  It’s a way to deflect attention from the issues by belittling the protesters, because they can’t can’t argue the main points.  They can’t deny that the Weissman group is a well known union busting firm, and that USC has hired them to intervene in the union election that is taking place in May.  Check out their website–the Weissman position is obvious.  The protesters express a perfectly legitimate desire that workers be allowed to organize, as is their legal right.  To quote the clearly biased position of the administration (they’re the one’s being called to account!) in the headline rather than actually saying what happened is just bad journalism.
If the employees organized themselves, then why the need for teh Weissman Group?  Mr. Creem states that he “has a legal obligation to make sure our employees are informed.”  Is USC incapable of telling the employees of their “options”, without paying for an outside consulting group?  One can only conclude that the Weissman Group was hired for the sole purpose of implementing a campaign to discourage the employees for  asserting their right to have their needs/concerns addressed by union representation.  That is the only way that “promises”, become “benefits”, and employees cannot be dismissed or fired at will.  Regardless of where the money comes from, or the amount spent, it is money that could be put to much better use improving th work environment to provide better care for our patients.  We, the  CNA represented RN’s, appreciate the commitment of the USC student community for workers rights, and hope for their continued support.
Tuition is the largest source of USC’s revenues. Regardless of how USC classifies its spending flows, we are part of this “community” and how its resources are used should be students’ concern.  
Faculty and students have signed a support letter in solidarity with USC healthcare workers, and calling on the administration to rescind the Weissman Group.
Who are they kidding? The hospital has to hire a consultant to inform union members of their options?My union rep Donora is right on point!
agree with Diane, these students clearly do not have both sides of the story but are protesting based on what the union members have told them. Students often think that to side with unions is the ‘right’ side of the issue. They would have been better served talking to both sides and being informed, that is what education is all about. if they did that and then sided with the unions, it would be ok because it their viewpoint after due diligence
I think it should be okay to protest when students know what the hell they are protesting. Clearly not the case here, as the students appear to be dupes for union organizers like Dinorah.
Notice the only thing cited in the article that actually contradicts any of the protesters’ claims is that it isn’t being paid for by tuition money. Incidentally, that doesn’t really address the core of their claims at all. By only taking issue with the amount of money in question and the source of the funds, Weissman is tacitly admitting that the union-busting claims are accurate. Actually read the article before making ignorant comments like this.
“They said that although it is OK for students to protest, those protests cannot interrupt university business.”
Seriously you can’t be serious. Seriously.

Safety Taylor Mays and offensive tackle Charles Brown highlighted a historically slow NFL draft for USC players that ended Saturday.
Mays was the first former USC player to be drafted, selected by the San Francisco 49ers with the 49th overall pick. Mays’ selection by the 49ers was the latest the first Trojan has been drafted since 2002.
That year, former USC cornerback Kris Richard was selected with the 85th overall pick.
UCLA also made a little history, having a player selected before a Trojan for the first time since the same 2002 draft.
The 49ers pick of Mays at such a late juncture of the draft was a surprise to many draft prognosticators, who believed that the senior safety was a sure-fire first-round pick.
After the draft, Mays was quoted as being disappointed at not being selected in the first round, and specifically called out former USC and current Seattle Seahawk coach Pete Carroll for misleading his expectations for the draft.
After Mays’ selection, it wasn’t until the final pick of the second round that another Trojan was selected — when the Super Bowl-winning New Orleans Saints chose Brown as the 64th overall pick.
Brown was also expected to be a late first-round or early-second round pick, but instead nosedived into the final pick of the second round, a surprise to many.
The Saints took full advantage of Brown’s drop, even though they don’t have any holes at offensive tackle.
The third round saw two more Trojans selected by NFL squads. Wide receiver Damian Williams was taken with the 77th overall pick by the Tennessee Titans, and cornerback Kevin Thomas’ name was called by the Indianapolis Colts with the 94th overall selection.
Defensive end Everson Griffen, who had been a top-flight draft prospect leading up to the draft, was selected with the second pick of the final day, No. 100 overall to the Minnesota Vikings. Like the Saints, Minnesota has no holes at the position but took advantage of Griffen’s draft drop.
Running back Joe McKnight was taken by the New York Jets just a few picks later as part of the Jets’ attempt to rebuild their running attack after letting Thomas Jones and Leon Washington go during the offseason.
Anthony McCoy, who tested positive for marijuana at the NFL combine, was selected by Carroll and the Seahawks at No. 185.
Those who were not drafted were quickly signed by other NFL squads as free agents. Running back Stafon Johnson signed with the Titans, and defensive backs Will Harris and Josh Pinkard and guard Jeff Byers all signed with Seattle.

A lot of things that happen in sports are unpredictable and unforeseeable.
It comes with the territory, I guess. We are trained to believe anything’s possible in the world of sports — on or off the field.
But every once in a while you get something so odd, so unprecedented, that you are a little shocked.
And that’s exactly what happened this weekend when Taylor Mays lashed out at his former coach, Pete Carroll.
See, for four years Mays was Carroll’s protégé. If you asked the 58-year-old coach about his star safety, his eyes would literally light up.
He would say things like: “He’s done exactly what we wanted — there’s a lot that goes on in his position that you don’t see that he deserves credit for.”
Or: “If you think about the last two seasons or the last three seasons, how many times somebody’s taken the ball, thrown it over our heads down the middle of the field ­— you can’t remember because it hasn’t happened.”
And so Mays believed the hype that his coach helped spark. Believed it so much he felt compelled to return for his senior season even though he was a projected top-20 pick in the 2009 draft.
Carroll praised him incessantly during offseason, especially in the wake of the departure of quarterback Mark Sanchez, who passed up a final year at USC to head to the NFL.
But, of course, things didn’t go as planned. Teams were watching Mays closer and saw some of his weaknesses. They saw a lack of ball-hawking ability, and a tendency to go for late hits, instincts that weren’t as good as they remembered and, consequently, Mays’ stock dropped significantly. And the Trojans had a mediocre season.
So when it came to last weekend, when Mays had hopes of going in the first round of the draft, forgive him if he got a little upset at his coach who essentially cost him millions and millions of dollars when he fell to the bottom half of the second round.
Of course, Carroll — now the coach of the Seattle Seahawks — had an opportunity to select Mays at the No. 14 spot in the first round. Instead, he chose Texas safety Earl Thomas. But that’s not what Mays was upset about. He was upset because Carroll constantly assuaged any concerns he had relating to his play instead of telling him the truth.
“[Pete] kept saying, ‘Taylor, you’ll be fine. You’re fine,’” Mays told ESPN Friday. “Obviously that wasn’t the case.”
It’s a tough situation, one almost unheard of in the hard-knocks world of professional sports. Mock him if you will, but you have to feel for Mays in a situation that had to — aside from taking away literally life-altering cash — have hurt his pride tremendously.
“He is someone I’ve trusted for a long time, been very close to,” he told reporters about Carroll. “I put my future in his hands when he told me to come back to school. I just feel like we weren’t on the same page for what I needed to do to get drafted where I wanted to be drafted.”
Perhaps the most telling aspect of this lash out by Mays is that he is one of the Trojans in recent years who have been most averse to opening up to the media, turning everything into a yes or no question. But not this weekend.
“I wish I would have known why I wouldn’t be taken in the first round,” he said Friday. “At least have been shown what I needed work on. Here’s my head coach, the person I trust most, telling me I had nothing to worry about and then I’m worrying about it [when it’s too late] because I’m not getting picked.”
Carroll responded, of course, with diplomacy. It’s hard to place all of the blame on him in this situation, because all he did wrong was try to assure his player that NFL teams would like him. And take another — better — player at the same position over him Thursday.
“We really were looking forward to picking Taylor,” Carroll said Saturday. “We thought we would get the chance to do that in the first round. And so when we made the pick, we felt fortunate to get Earl, but we were really hoping that we were gonna get a chance to get [Taylor], but unfortunately we didn’t.”
Whether or not you believe that Carroll’s Seahawks were really hoping to get Mays with their second-round selection, as he seemed to indicate, does not really matter. Any of the other 31 teams could have taken him too. But what does matter is that one of Carroll’s players, one of his favorite players of the past several years, didn’t know how to best prepare himself for the NFL draft because the coach was unaware of his weaknesses — or afraid to tell him.
“It was interesting,” Mays said when questioned more on the issue by reporters. “I thought from the relationship that we have, the things he had told me about, what I needed to be aware of through the draft process, things I needed to do, I felt like he told me the complete opposite of the actions that he took, which was alarming.”
Alarming? Yes. Unfortunate? Even more so.

Taylor Mays earned a BA as well as a pro contract. Too many outstanding college athletes do not. Criticizing Carroll in the press was a bit unseemly.But only a bit.
Mays asked Carroll for advice about his career and didn’t receive it. I think college football players expect their head coaches to guide them soundly, just as undergraduates expect their professors to instruct them well. USC educates its students  well,whether they’re athletes or not. isn’t that why Mays went to USC? And which hype did he believe-USC’s about itself,or Carroll’s about him?
No need to tar and feather uncle Pete. 
@ observer, no need to give Mays tough love. He’s in his early 20s, and you got to consider that he’s naive. He was loyal and followed his coach’s advice without question. It’s a disillusionment for Mays, which sadly, can cause some to be cynical and untrusting of people.
I agree with Parent’s comments above. Once Mark Sanchez made the decision to bolt for the NFL ( and, in a show of unprofessionalism, Carroll derided  Mark during his press conference), Carroll naturally tried to dissuade Taylor Mays from leaving as well. Why? It was in Carroll’s interests for Mays to stay on another year. And Mays believed him, leaving millions on the table. Taylor will shine in San Francisco and thrive under its disciplined coach, Mark Singletary. 
Stick it to the Seahawks 49’ers!!
Taylor Mays trusted Coach Carroll and left 20 million dollars oon the table coming back for his senior year.  Where is the loyality on Carrolls behalf?.  Also Coach Carroll had Taylor play a certain way that was just not in his best interest for Taylor with regard to being drafted.  No different than the way Urban Meyer utilized Tebow for the Gators.  What worked for Tebow at the college wasn’t nessescarily in his best interest when getting drafted into the NFL.  Taylor is very compettive as well as smart.  Add too that this enourmous chip on his shoulder that he is ging to use to show the world Carroll made a huge mistake by passing on his protege!. As if that isn’t enough, add in one of the most intense head coaches since Vince Lombardi I am confident Taylor will not only dominate in the NFL but will make back the 20 million he lost by staying his senior year in his second  contract.  As for Carroll he has gotten away with so much over the years by being charming and disarming in a very manipulitive way.  I am sure this t shall continue up in Seattle.  There are some idividuals who skate through life becuae of a public personna that indeed just may be ingenious at best.  One last thing you are an amazing young sports TV (ATVN) & Print  (Daily Trojan)reporter but for God’s sake let your hair grw in so you don’t look like a “homie” form the hood!
Taylor, welcome to the real world.  Carroll took care of himself, his team, and individual players in that order.  Now that you are in the NFL as he promised, stop acting like Pollyanna.  It’s not becoming.
Carroll did not play Mays where he should have–both the team AND Mays suffered for it last fall.

For a season that began with lofty goals and high expectations, Saturday night’s conclusion for the USC’s men’s volleyball team was far from the national title the team imagined.
Although the No. 6 Trojans (16-11) went into their MPSF tournament quarterfinal match with 16 straight losses to the No. 3 Cal State Northridge Matadors this time was supposed to be different. This time was supposed to be a mere stepping stone on a path paved toward a potential national championship run.

In sports, however, even the best-laid plans are often far from a guarantee — regardless of the time spent. And for a unit that had several key contributors from last season’s NCAA final team, this year ended in the blink of an eye (17-30, 33-31, 31-33 and 26-30).
If the opening set was any indication of how the night would go, it appeared the writing was on the wall early for the Trojans. Despite keeping it close against a dynamic Matador  (22-8) team after falling behind 9-6, USC’s biggest adversary all year, hitting percentage — came out at the most inopportune of times. Aided by the Trojans’ negative hitting percentage (-.069) and a mere two blocks, CSUN coasted to an easy 30-17 set win.
But, if there had been something the Trojans have hung their hat on all year, it is their ability to claw their way back into matches.
In the second set, USC relied on five service aces from three different players (junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy, sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli and junior setter Riley McKibbin), yet still found themselves trailing 31-30 late in the set. After Troy tied it with an ace at 31, CSUN made one of its few errors all night to put USC up 33-31. And just as he has done time and time again in his career, Troy put away the match with a devastating kill (33-31).
The third set appeared to be the Ciarelli and Troy show early on, as the two  dominated the initial minutes with multiple kills en route to an 11-4 lead. But a team doesn’t get to No. 3 in the country without great poise, and the Matadors proved they were more than worthy of their ranking. Paced by two separate four-point runs, CSUN and its middle blocker Jacek Ratajczak (19 kills, 9 blocks and .500 hitting percentage on the night) stormed back to take a 22-18 lead. USC would eventually tie it back up at 28 with a five-point stand of its own, but a Ratajczak kill coupled with an untimely error gave CSUN a 2-1 advantage in the match with a 33-31 victory.
The Trojans desperately tried to avoid the end of their season from coming. An early 7-4 lead would be for naught, as the Matadors put a stranglehold on the back-and-forth final set with timely attacks and polished defense. CSUN would take a commanding 22-18 lead, despite the early run USC mounted, and never looked back, as it finished off the Trojans 30-26.
For the Trojans, the night was summarized by their .112 hitting percentage, but they were led by two note-worthy performances from Troy (23 kills and 10 digs) and Ciarelli (14 kills), both of whom will be back next season to make another run at the NCAA tournament.
For CSUN, Ratajczak was not the only shining star for the semifinal-bound Matadors. Opposite hitter Theo Edwards chipped in with 11 kills, while outside hitter Mike Gaudino also had a huge contribution with 10 kills and 12 digs.
Although one player described the mood of the team after the season-ending loss as heated and charged up, others took time to reflect on the lessons learned from the season.
“We learned that [CSUN] is a team that cannot be underestimated,” said senior middle blocker Hunter Current. “They have good coaching and hustle-type players. It has been a challenging year and a learning experience for us all. The NCAA tourney just wasn’t in the cards.”
What a complete farce losing 17 in a row to CSUN. That sums up the program in the last eight years with one unexpected run last season to the final match for the title with Irvine. You can’t out recruit that school with the new facilities at Galen Ctr. or prestige of  USC something is amiss. The recruiting the last two years produced one starter in Tony Ciarelli with no real libero to step into the lineup. Team is competitive , but lacking something in chemistry to get the best of the talent.

If the annual exodus of USC players to the NFL demonstrates anything, it is the importance of having talented players waiting in the wings.
Seven former Trojans were drafted last weekend, and eight more either signed with a team as a free agent or are still looking. Their departures leave holes across the field next season that will need to be filled.
Impactful · Freshman wide receiver Kyle Prater sprained his thumb earlier this spring and wore a cast at practice Saturday but still caught two passes for 21 yards. Prater has received praise from both teammates and coaches during spring practice. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
Fortunately for USC, the roster is packed with gifted freshmen and sophomores eager to make their mark.
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley gets most of the attention, but there are plenty more underclassmen who will play key roles in the upcoming season.
Sophomore linebacker Devon Kennard impressed in spot duty last season, racking up 34 tackles and three pass deflections. The converted defensive end started the final four games of last season and has impressed USC coach Lane Kiffin this spring.
“[Kennard] looks like an NFL player right now,” Kiffin said at the start of spring practice. “[He’s] one of the few of our guys that look like we used to look when we were here.”
On Saturday, Kennard backed up his coach’s praise with eight tackles and a sack.
“I thought [the scrimmage] went really well,” Kennard said. “I was moving around, making a lot of tackles. I made a couple of mistakes but I’ll go back, watch some film and clean it up.”
Kennard is just one of the linebackers who gained valuable experience last season after Clay Matthews, Brian Cushing and Rey Maualuga moved on to the NFL. Senior Michael Morgan, senior Malcolm Smith and redshirt juniors Chris Galippo and Jordan Campbell also made at least one start for USC.
“We have four or five guys who started a game at linebacker and we’re ready to go in there and prove everybody wrong about what we’re about,” Kennard said. “I definitely hope I can contribute and help bring back the Trojan linebacker [tradition].”
USC also has the No. 1 recruiting class in the country, according to Rivals.com, and the coaching staff has gotten an early look at a couple of the newcomers.  Running back Dillon Baxter and wide receiver Kyle Prater enrolled at USC this spring in order to practice with the team early and have made immediate impacts.
In his short time on campus, Baxter has thrust himself into the running back rotation and become a YouTube sensation thanks to an impressive 50-yard run making the rounds online. The reigning high school National Player of the Year is already being compared with another running back from San Diego: Reggie Bush.
Prater, a physical force at 6-foot-5 and 215 pounds, has impressed coaches with his playmaking ability and, on Saturday, his toughness.
“It really says a lot about the kid that we pushed him out here and he came out in a cast [even though] he obviously can’t catch with that hand at all,” Kiffin said. “That was good to see.”
Prater, who sprained his thumb earlier this spring and wore a cast at practice, had just two catches for 21 yards on Saturday but has been impossible to cover at times during the spring.
“I feel like I can bring playmaking ability,” Prater said. “I know I can go out here and make plays and help us win a national championship, [which] is why I came here.”
This spring, he has leaned on senior receivers Ronald Johnson and David Ausberry. Their advice has been simple: Stay humble and listen.
“I’m just glad I came in early because it’s given me a big step ahead of the other guys coming [with] the playbook,” Prater said. “And when they come in I can help them out as well. It’s just going to be that much better.”
This fall, five-star recruits like receiver Robert Woods, tight end Xavier Grimble and offensive tackle Seantrel Henderson will give the USC offense added firepower. Even without former standouts like Taylor Mays and Everson Griffen on the field, the Trojans will attempt to replace the star power they lost.
—
USC’s roster might be littered with talented underclassmen, but a trio of veteran players stood out Saturday. Senior quarterback Mitch Mustain completed 12 of 22 passes for 167 yards and two touchdowns, senior running back Allen Bradford rushed for 89 yards and two scores and Ausberry hauled in a 42-yard catch-and-run touchdown.

Even if you are unfamiliar with subway systems like New York’s and our own here in Los Angeles, we can all relate to the irritation of being subjected to displays of rude public behavior.  Whether it’s on an airplane, waiting in line at the bank or even walking around the USC campus, perpetrators of the social faux pas are a reality of urban life.
After taking a survey of 100 subway riders to find out what inappropriate habits irritated them most, New York artist Jay Shells (aka Jason Shelowitz) transformed his findings into a slyly inventive series of mock public service announcement-style ads. Shells stealthily installed the campaign signs at various subway spots around the city, beginning with the 8th Avenue L station.
The signs imitate MTA posters — the design of their “MEA” insignia, which stands for “Metropolitan Etiquette Authority,” is an almost unnoticeable alteration of MTA’s actual logo — and although the mimicry technically constitutes a highly illegal breed of vandalism because of how nearly it resembles the signage of an official government department, the press has gone crazy singing the praises of the subversive artistic campaign.
Bright yellow and emblazoned with black typeface, the signs instruct readers in various elements of public transit etiquette including nail clipping, eating, religious lecturing, noise pollution, hygiene and seating priority. The explanatory messages are usually three to four sentences and, despite their sarcasm, have been unequivocally embraced by passengers and the press alike — after all, everyone can support a sign that instructs passengers to “keep your finger out of your nose. Please.”
You can view the signs here.

Pete Carroll doesn’t coach USC football anymore, but he can’t escape the players of his past. And he’s hearing criticism from one former Trojan in particular, safety Taylor Mays.
Mays was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers with the 49th overall pick. But despite being the first Trojan selected, Mays was not happy that his former coach did not select him in the first round.
The Seattle Seahawks, Carroll’s new team, opted to take safety Earl Thomas with the 14th pick instead.
“I felt he told me the complete opposite of the actions that he took, which was definitely alarming,” Mays said to Bay Area reporters during a conference call.
Mays considered entering the draft last year but decided to stay for his senior season. If he had left a year early, many thought he would have been a top-10 selection. Mays feels that Carroll did not help him adequately prepare for this year’s draft.
“I didn’t have anything to worry about, that my game was OK … All these points and I was kind of led to think that I would have been OK,” Mays said in reference to Pete Carroll’s advice regarding how to better his draft stock.
Although Carroll may have passed on Mays, he did seize the chance to add other ex-Trojans. Will Harris, Jeff Byers, and Josh Pinkard are expected to sign free agent deals with the Seahawks. The team drafted TE Anthony McCoy in the sixth round and acquired former USC running back LenDale White in a trade with the Tennessee Titans.

The No. 18 USC women’s tennis team wrapped up competition in Ojai, Calif., at the 2010 Pac-10 singles and doubles championships Friday, after falling short of a few semifinal bids.
“It would have been nice to have someone from USC in the finals, but I think we were more focused on being fresh and healthy for NCAA’s,” junior Cristala Andrews said.
The No. 3 nationally ranked singles player for USC (13-9, 5-3), junior Maria Sanchez, rested a stress fracture in her ankle and didn’t compete in the weekend’s tournament.
While senior Sarah Fansler and freshman Valeria Pulido fell in the first round of the championship singles bracket to different California opponents, sophomore Alison Ramos made it to the round of 16 by outlasting her Washington challenger in three sets in the opening round. Ramos was then stopped in a close match by Arizona State University’s Hannah James 7-6 (5), 6-4.
Meanwhile, in the invitational singles bracket, juniors Lyndsay Kinstler and Leyla Entekhabi won their first singles matches but then were defeated in the round of 16. Fourth-seeded Andrews shut out her opponent in the round of 16 to enter in the quarterfinal round but was edged 6-3, 6-2 by UCLA’s Nina Pantic.
In the championship flight of doubles play, Fansler and Kinstler withdrew in the first round because of injury. On the other end of the bracket, Ramos and Lao came out with a powerful 8-6 win to advance themselves to the quarterfinals. Next, they faced the second seeded duo from UCLA and fell short of a semifinal bid by losing 8-2.
In the invitational flight, Andrews and Pulido followed suit by earning a spot in the quarterfinal round with an 8-1 win over Arizona’s pair. They were later taken down by 8-5 to a pair from Washington.
The Women of Troy will next compete at the NCAA championships next month.

After an extra-innings victory Saturday, USC needed a strong performance from senior starting pitcher Kevin Couture to keep the momentum going Sunday.
Unfortunately for the Trojans, Couture was not sharp, and the No. 18 Oregon Ducks won the series finale, 8-4, to take two of three.
Couture struggled out of the gate, allowing two runs in the first inning to put the Trojans behind, 2-0.
USC’s (17-22, 3-12 Pac-10) bats responded with four runs in the top of the third. Junior infielder Joe De Pinto scored on a wild pitch with the bases loaded to make it 2-1.
Two batters later, senior infielder Keith Castillo hit a two-run single to left. Sophomore catcher Kevin Roundtree followed with an RBI groundout, giving the Trojans a 4-2 lead.
But Couture continued to struggle in the bottom of the third, when he loaded the bases with nobody out to start the inning. After designated hitter Ryan Hambright struck out, Couture served up a grand slam to Oregon third baseman J.J. Altobelli.
The next batter doubled before Couture was removed. He lasted just two and one-third innings, giving up six earned runs on 10 hits to take the loss and fall to 2-2.
USC’s offense went silent after the third, mustering just three singles and a double during the final six innings of play.
Oregon’s Zack Thornton pitched seven shutout innings in relief of starter Alex Keudell, who was charged with all four USC runs.
On Saturday, the Trojans trailed 2-0 after two innings of play, but scored one in the third and one in the seventh to tie the game.
They went ahead with two runs in the top of the ninth inning, but the Ducks tied it with two in the bottom of the frame.
USC was able to manufacture a run in the top of the 10th inning to take the lead. Freshman outfielder Alex Glenn walked with two outs, stole second, advanced to third on a wild pitch and scored on senior outfielder Mike O’Neill’s single.
Junior reliever Chris Mezger put two men on with one out in the bottom of the inning before shutting the door to earn the 5-4 victory. He improved to 4-0 on the season.
Oregon routed USC on Friday, scoring six runs in the first three innings on the way to a 12-2 win.
Sophomore starting pitcher Andrew Triggs allowed seven runs, four earned, in five innings. He also allowed 11 hits and walked three Oregon batters.
Ducks starter Tyler Anderson struck out 10 Trojans during his six and two-thirds innings of work.
The Trojans remain in last place in the Pac-10 and have a lot of ground to make up with just 12 conference games remaining.
USC’s next game is Tuesday at UC Santa Barbara before the team returns for three games at home against No. 17 Arizona.

Presence of guns creates a safer society
John Gudenzi’s opinion article published April 23, titled “Presence of guns would trigger anxiety,” is laden with misrepresentations. The most heinous of them is the misrepresentation of the ruling by the Colorado Court of Appeals, which decided to revoke the earlier ruling — not on the basis of the judges being members of the National Rifle Association or on Constitutional grounds — but because they interpreted the law to mean that the decision to ban guns on campuses is one that is left to the university’s Board of Regents — not the state of Colorado.
But seeing as how the majority of Gudenzi’s piece is an attack on gun rights, I will take the opportunity to refute them. First is the realization that gun control laws did not prevent the murders at Virginia Tech, Columbine or any other school affected by firearm tragedies. Gun control laws are not a reaction to these murders; they are justification in context of failure. When people like Gudenzi see gun control laws fail, as they did at Virginia Tech, the answer is apparently more and stronger gun control laws. The problem with this line of thinking is that criminals do not follow the law. The people who are disturbed enough to commit these heinous acts are not going to feel bound by these laws, and thus these laws only punish the people whose rights have been taken away.
Beside the absurdity of the fictional situation composed by Gudenzi to justify his position — that a USC student would murder another USC student in the middle of the day because they bumped into each other accidentally — Gudenzi misinterprets the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment does not exist to ensure that citizens can rise up against a tyrannical government; it exists to ensure that citizens are assured the right of self-
defense against a tyrannical government. Just as the First Amendment is interpreted in modern times to guarantee the right of expression, the Second Amendment is now interpreted to guarantee the right to self-defense.
Should we outlaw karate schools because people can use karate to kill other people? Should I be scared just because the woman sitting next to me in lecture took a USC-sanctioned self-defense class the night before? Of course not. These are irrational reactions, and I believe that Gudenzi’s choice of hypothetical situation speaks more to his fear that his classmates are psychopaths than his fear that those psychopaths might know karate.
The existence of guns in society makes everyone safer. When society institutes gun control laws, an attacker knows that there is a greater chance that his victim will be unarmed — unable to use a weapon that is the great equalizer in a fight. When society removes gun control laws, people can carry around firearms with the secure feeling that they will be able to defend themselves no matter how strong their attacker is.
As a result, crime goes down, and we respect each other as equals.

There’s more reason to be excited rather than worried that Facebook, Google, Twitter and a long list of other web services are asking users to share more information publicly.
Sullivan Brown | Daily Trojan
Many have raised concerns that Facebook’s latest feature, which allows any website to add a “like” button to its contents, will lead to a vast database of information that Facebook can sell to marketers and advertisers. The company’s innovations, however, will bring users more efficiency, expertise and connectivity than ever before.
Though many use the social networking service primarily for looking at photos and keeping in touch with friends, these information-collecting websites could offer people something more.
Now, when you’re signed into Facebook and visit the Internet radio service Pandora, the website will start playing a song from one of your favorite artists. Then it moves on to songs it knows you’ve frequently discussed on Facebook, followed by a song whose lyrics were in your status a few weeks ago.
Creepy? Yes. Brilliantly efficient? Yes.
Without ever having to type a word, Pandora knew what music you liked and played it on your computer. This is exactly what Facebook’s new “instant personalization” feature does.
In the future, it could get even better. Five minutes after Tweeting that you’re bummed because you failed a test, you fire up Pandora and it plays some upbeat, high-intensity songs to cheer you up.
Browsing a website, such as nytimes.com, could also become simpler someday. The newspaper produces far too much content to sift through. What if, upon your visit, the site told you what your Facebook friends had been reading, liking and writing statuses about. You’d be guaranteed to be in the loop, and the issue of scanning through pages of headlines to find relevant news becomes a tad easier. Right now, you can only get this “magical” experience — as Facebook calls it — on CNN.com.
How exciting does it sound to one day walk into Ralphs and receive a text message with an automatically generated shopping list that includes aisle numbers for where items can be located and coupons for the items on sale? All of this information could come from a calculation based on your status update about craving Mexican food, the Mexican restaurants you’ve reviewed on Yelp and your Google searches for Mexican recipes before leaving for the store.
Personalization is a reason to worry about privacy. Having the ability to control how much information people know about us is part of what makes us feel human.
Although some say social networking sites take away the ability to control your personal information, Facebook and other websites have actually reminded us about this control mechanism and enhanced our ability to segregate who gets what. It reminds people to stay clear of activities and habits that society would perceive negatively.
Facebook has always been good at quickly disseminating information to many people. For instance, say you post that you bought tickets to a Ke$ha concert. Not all of your friends need to know about that fact; only your friends with similar music tastes really care. Those friends that visit Ticketmaster.com might also be swayed to buy a ticket if they’re told you’ve already bought one. Personalization means pulling information from a vast pool of knowledge and placing it directly in front of the eyes of the right person. It’s targeted and efficient.
One downside to the hyper-
personalization of your experiences on the Internet appears to be the fact that certain objects, websites and news will fall between the cracks, leaving people misguided and misinformed. For many years, sociologists have studied self-selection, the method by which people choose to hear what they want to hear and ignore what they don’t want to hear.
Personalization could make this problem worse. To counteract this, websites could appoint expert content editors to essential news items the general public feels are important.
This would bring the values of impact and popularity to the personalized collection of information, offering people a more valuable experience.
As far as the inextricable link between loosening the grips on the concealment of our lives and the benefits of personalization, the rewards rule.

The next time an eyelash falls out of your eye, or the next time a ladybug lands on your arm, don’t wish for a happy future.
Many of us, especially graduating seniors, have this seemingly innocent hope on our minds with the approaching summer.
But when it comes to happiness, Buddhists seem to have had the right idea all along: If you want to be happy, stop wanting to be happy. Let go of your desires. This advice might not seem very helpful at first glance, but the science behind it can reveal some useful tips.
As a species, we developed an inclination to compare ourselves to others. It’s ingrained in our biology to do this and to feel an unpleasant emotion — envy — when we encounter someone with a superior circumstance, quality or possession. Throughout history, this tendency to desire what others has increased our chances of survival, motivating us to improve our lives.
Once upon a time, it was actually possible to be superior at something or own something unique because we lived in small groups rarely exceeding 500 individuals.
But nowadays, the sheer volume of people we’re comparing our lives to means we’re bound to feel like failures — especially with movies, T.V. shows, Facebook and other mass media outlets skewing our assumptions about what the average human achieves.
The tendency has become counterproductive and emotionally self-destructive; it leads to an inescapable feeling of dissatisfaction perhaps responsible for unprecedented divorce rates.
“Ancestral humans may have had a dozen or two potential mates to choose from,” wrote evolutionary psychologist David M. Buss in an article called “The Evolution of Happiness.” “Modern humans, in contrast, are surrounded by thousands of potential mates. They are bombarded by media images of attractive models on a scale that has no historical precedent and that may lead to unreasonable expectations about the quality and quantity of available mates.”
Laboratory studies have shown that if you expose a man to pictures of sexually idealized women, his opinion of his commitment to his partner will plummet. Exposing women to pictures of powerful, good-looking men has a similar effect.
Discontent arising from comparisons to an unrealistic standard is true also of our positions in society, our capacities and our appearances.
More and more women, for example, are unable to embrace their subtle imperfections because they are surrounded by often unrealistic images of celebrities who have undergone plastic surgery. As a result, they pay thousands of dollars to sculpt, sew and stuff their bodies — like reality T.V. star Heidi Montag, who had her lips and breasts ballooned to abnormal sizes, her chin reduced, her ears pinned and her eyebrows lifted.
The same is true for men, whose insecurities and feelings of inadequacy are triggered when their concept of the average man is inaccurately shaped by popular entertainment, in which Average Joe is a muscular, rugged and unfeeling Casanova.
So how do we get around this innate tendency to compare ourselves to others? We can start by not being materialistic. A recent San Francisco State University study found that we tend to gravitate toward material possessions very quickly. That’s why someone who has three cars is rarely happier than someone who has one, two or even none.
Ryan Howell, the leader of the study, discovered that experiences, unlike material possessions, provide happiness in the long-term because memories of the experience renew the emotions attached to it. Moreover, it is harder to compare your own experiences to and find superiority in another’s than it is with a material possession.
So if you want to be happy, go out and do things — go for a walk around campus, have a picnic with friends, go camping, go to the beach. Don’t buy new things.
Unfortunately, our image-oriented culture causes us to become fixated on appearances, which are by nature as easy to compare as material possessions.
Perhaps by spending less time in front of the television, or with our noses in fashion magazines, we can start to cultivate and nurture our inner lives, which are unique to each individual.
It would be very hard to be jealous of somebody for being more compassionate or empathic than you. Comparing your inner self to another’s can only lead to inspiration. I’m not talking about music tastes or clothing styles or other superficial aspects of a personality. I’m talking about the deepest aspects of one’s being: one’s overall approach to life and others.
Studies show that doing nice things for others and expressing gratitude stimulates the vagus nerve, which causes “that feeling of warm expansion in the chest,” according to psychologist Dacher Keltner in a Scientific American article called “Forget Survival of the Fittest: It is Kindness that Counts.”
Meditation also increases feelings of well-being associated with activation in the left frontal lobes, which are responsible for compassion.
Society needs to redefine happiness in order to obtain it. Happiness is not associated with positive circumstances — getting a job after college or that BMW you always wanted.
It’s tied to the acceptance of one’s circumstances — the obliteration of desires that results from looking internally and being kind to oneself and others.
Like Buddhists, we need to sit and breathe and concentrate on the fact that we are lucky just to be who we are.

Neeraj Sood, an associate professor at the USC School of Pharmacy’s Titus Family Department, has been selected as one of five finalists for the National Institute of Health Care Management Award, according to USC News.
The annual award, now in its 16th year, honors those who have published work and done research that furthers innovation in health care. Such innovations may include more efficient methods of health care financing and delivery and implementation of health care policy.
In addition to recognition, the winner will receive a monetary prize of $10,000 at a dinner in Washington, D.C. in May.
Sood was recognized for an article submitted to the Health Services Research Journal. The article focused on the effect of health care costs that grow disproportionately larger than employment, gross output and value added to gross domestic product of U.S. industries. He concluded that the growth in health care costs adversely affects the economic performance of U.S. industries.
In addition to his research, Sood serves as director of international programs for the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at USC. He has published 10 peer-reviewed articles in the last four years in major journals and has been awarded in excess of $3 million in grants to aid his research.
