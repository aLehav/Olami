The social probation on fraternities has been lifted effective today, according to a letter sent by Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson. 
Parties are still only permitted on Friday and Saturday nights while classes are in session.  
The ban has prohibited informal gatherings at fraternities on Tuesday and Thursday nights since April 2011, after several negative events occurred within the Greek community.  
“Your community is working diligently to demonstrate the ability to self-govern,” Jackson wrote in an email to the Greek community. “Stay focused on this important issue. Your leaders are on the right track and are prepared for a restoration social privileges, in accordance with other university policies, without the necessity of the extra level of scrutiny imposed by the social probation.” 
The email reminded Greek students that parties are not allowed to continue beyond 10 p.m. on weekday nights, as specified in SCampus.
The probation was lifted because the Greek community had begun to successfully implement recommendations of the Greek Task Force, which was developed after the ban began.
Jackson wrote that these recommendations would result in a “stronger, more responsible and more respected community.” 
Well, I hope the Greeks enjoyed their day off social probation.  Now that we have drunk students falling off frat roofs, I have a feeling that the Row is about to be sanctioned again.  Good job, guys!
Greek houses should be banned altogether.  They try to pass as social gathering spots that do philanthropy and support each students, but are really just places for alcohol, drugs and hooking up.  The few that aren’t like that are the “low” houses that no one likes or pays attention to.
The whole thing is a charade, for example the way they brag that they have higher GPA’s than the school overall.  Well that’s because they withhold the information of the poor performing members of the house, either by taking them off of official lists or putting them on house probation, which just means that they can party and do everything else but aren’t counted statistically.
Greek life, however, is great at teaching girls what they’re only value is in life, and I think we all know what I’m talking about.
Oh,  this is coming from a fraternity brother by the way.
You mad bro?  Didn’t get a bid?  Sorry!
^Typical Greek response to criticism.
Got a bid to one of the “top” houses, three years ago.  Just have grown up a lot since then.
Just because you know what one house does doesn’t mean you know what all houses do- I was Philanthropy Chair for my house and we contributed a huge amount of time and money to the community during my term.  I also earned above a 3.5 those two semesters, along with most of my friends.
Just because you are unhappy with the decision you made, doesn’t mean you have the right to stereotype and badmouth all of the other houses that you really know nothing about.
I didn’t mean to stereotype all houses and all members.  I’m just describing the pervasive and popular culture that exists.  All the best to you. Wish others were more like you.
Pike never gets caught!
Thats only because STD tests are confidential.
Get banged on
The article says that the ban was regarding “informal gatherings” on Tuesday and Thursdays, but it really banned from Sunday afternoon through Thursday evening.  
Also, the article says no parties are allowed except Friday and Saturday nights, yet it also says “parties are not allowed to continue beyond 10pm on weekday nights”.  So which one is it?
Back in my day, we only had to worry about the beer running out. You kids better be in bed by ten!
This will last all of 10 minutes…yet again

Can Minnesota mount a ground game against USC?
When these two teams met a year ago, the Golden Gophers struggled to find a rhythm running the ball, finishing with 83 yards on 37 carries (2.2 yards per carry). Quarterback Marqueis Gray could play a big factor in establishing a running game, as the junior has drawn comparisons to Cam Newton and Vince Young, based on body type, and presents several challenges to USC’s defense because of his dynamic playmaking ability. If he escapes the pocket, he could pose problems for the Trojans.
Who will emerge in the tailback battle at USC?
As many have noted, the USC depth chart is chock full of the word “OR,” and the running back position is no exception. After practice Thursday, USC coach Lane Kiffin said he still had not settled on a starting tailback, and as many as four players — McNeal, Morgan, Baxter and Carlisle — could get meaningful carries. A year ago, the Trojans ran wild on Minnesota, amassing 216 yards on 38 carries (5.7 ypc).
How will USC’s secondary respond to the criticisms of last year and recent adverse events?
Secondary coach Willie Mack Garza resigned Thursday afternoon, just 48 hours before the season opener, citing personal issues unrelated to USC. The Trojans must rely on their secondary to play an integral part in their defensive resurgence, and they have a good nucleus coming back. Junior safety T.J. McDonald is a preseason All-American, and sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey emerged as a solid defender by the end of 2010. After receiving word that Garza had resigned, McDonald tweeted, “For those worried we are going to be just fine!”
How will the offensive line perform?
Out of the 120 teams in the NCAA’s Football Bowl Subdivision, only nine of them do not have a single senior starting on their offensive line. USC is one of them. Though the starting lineup is not set in stone, junior transfer Jeremy Galten and sophomore John Martinez will likely start at the guard positions. Sophomore Kevin Graf and juniors Matt Kalil and Khaled Holmes round out the starting lineup. Fortunately for the inexperienced group, Minnesota recorded just nine sacks last season.
Will Matt Barkley reestablish a connection with Robert Woods?
Woods burst on to the scene as a true freshman in 2010 and earned Freshman All-America honors. He established an excellent rapport with Barkley and the two hooked up for numerous touchdowns in preseason scrimmages. The duo has garnered national recognition in the preseason. They were named to the Pony Express Award watch list, a new honor given to the best tandem in the country.
Can Minnesota upset No. 25 USC?
Pat Forde of ESPN picked the Golden Gophers, who are 23-point underdogs this weekend, to come away with a victory at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday. Statistics, however, do not bode well for Minnesota. Jerry Kill will be coaching his first game for Minnesota. The last time a Golden Gopher coach won his debut? John Gutekunst in 1986. USC has also not lost a season opener since 1997.
