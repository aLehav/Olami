This week, students can celebrate diversity at USC and learn about the benefits of international exchange through International Education Week, taking place Nov. 14-18 on campus. USC’s Office of International Services is hosting various activities held around campus, organized around the theme of “Empowering Youth Through International Education.” 
The U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Education jointly sponsor IEW to promote global study. This year, the USC Office of International Services partnered with several departments on campus to offer a variety of international programming, including film screenings, cooking lessons and a photography contest.
The opening ceremony for the IEW took place Monday at noon at the Von KleinSmid Center courtyard. It was an opportunity for people to take pictures under the flags of the international plaza and to get free sushi, boba milk tea and henna tattoos. The organizers and international students were dressed in traditional attire from their country of origin. They represented countries like Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand and Vietnam.
“We are hoping that the USC community will be able to celebrate with us,” said Esther Lee, associate director of the Office of International Services at USC. 
USC students like Saumyamukesh Lathia, a graduate student studying planning, volunteered to dress up in traditional outfits and serve as henna artists. 
“Henna designs are an important part of the Indian culture, and I was really excited to see that we had such an event during the IEW,” Lathia said. “As soon as I got the OIS email about the event, I signed up to volunteer right away.”
Onzali Suba, a graduate student studying data informatics, said she was excited about the celebration of cultures from around the world.
“We are getting to know about different cultures, which is great that the IEW is celebrating the global community at USC,” Suba said. “It is also amazing because we get free food.”
Nitya Pydipati, a graduate student studying data informatics, lauded the efforts of OIS for organizing the IEW.
“It is amazing that USC is making an effort to help international students feel at home,” Pydipati said. “It allows others to be exposed to cultures from around the world and also gives everyone a chance to interact with international exchange students at USC.”
More events will take place throughout the week. On Wednesday, IEW organizers will showcase a foreign language film along with an opera by Osvaldo Golijov. The next day, they are offering ‘Unique Eats,” where students can learn to cook different international foods. Students will also discuss their views on the future of global health with a panel of four Global Health Corps alumni. On Friday, fourth and fifth graders from the 32nd Street School near campus will participate in a program called “Around the World in 60 Minutes,” where USC students from China, France and India will teach them about their different cultures, countries and languages.
The IEW closing celebration will be at the Engineering Quad on Friday, 5-8 p.m.

Voter turnout at on-campus polling places, as well as the number of people registered to vote on campus, has decreased over the past three presidential elections, according to preliminary records from the Los Angeles County Registrar.
Two hundred and thirty-eight ballots were cast at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Nov. 8, out of 1,418 registered voters. According to historic ballot data from the L.A. County Registrar, 820 ballots were cast at the same location in the 2012 general election, out of 1,663 registered voters for that location. In the 2008 general election, 1,201 ballots were cast out of 1,958 registered voters. 
Political science professor Ann Crigler proposed several causes for the lower number of voters in this election cycle, including lower total registration or a difference in student body demographics, which would possibly lead to more out-of-state voters or non-American citizens. Crigler also noted that USC fell far short of UCLA in the voter registration competition, citing political disengagement as another possible cause for the lower turnout at USC and in the nation as a whole.
“There’s a lot of contention in this election, at the presidential level especially, and some of that has been found to make people more cynical and feel as if, ‘why bother to participate in this?’” Crigler said. “A lot of people are arguing that they had a choice between two bads, and they were just going to have to pick the one that was less bad. That’s not a real inspiring, ‘get out and vote’ kind of effort.” 
For some students, choosing between two candidates that they felt were unappealing kept them out of the polls. Danielle Dirksen, a freshman majoring in environmental studies, didn’t register to vote because she said both of the candidates seemed “hopeless.” However, she said that the trajectory of the election and the numerous advertisements and persuasions to vote swayed her to feel guilty about her decision.
“Three days before the election I regretted not registering, but by then it was too late,” Dirksen said. “I realized how serious this election really was, and it does matter if you vote. One vote itself is not going to change anything, but if multiple people think the way I did, it’ll have an impact.”
Because of the “winner-take-all” system, all of the electoral votes in a state are granted to whichever candidate gets the majority of the popular vote. In a state such as California, which leans overwhelmingly liberal, conservatives such as Maxwell Brandon, a freshman majoring in business administration who identifies as a Republican, may feel that their votes do not have as much of an impact.
“I voted to exercise my right to vote, which a lot of people don’t have, and to say I took part in the election process,” Brandon said. “Even though in this state, [my vote] doesn’t really matter as far as the presidential election, some of the smaller stuff does matter.”
This often leads students who have the opportunity to vote elsewhere to seize that opportunity. Timothy Nguyen, a senior majoring in cinematic arts, critical studies and accounting, decided to vote in his home state of Florida instead of at USC. 
“Especially because I live in a battleground state … I would have felt guilty if I didn’t partake in my constitutional right to vote,” Nguyen said. “For the most part I was very ambivalent about this presidential election, but when I consulted with my friends, they were very concerned about their safety and their place in America. I felt like it was my  duty to represent their views on the election as best as I could.”
For Jerica Manuel, a sophomore majoring in computer science (games), concern about her family’s place in America was what led her to vote in this presidential election.
“My mom talked about [this election] a lot more than she did other elections,” Manuel said. “‘[Trump] hates us,’ she’d say, and by ‘us’, she meant immigrants. I’m the only U.S. citizen in my family, so I voted, because my family didn’t, and still doesn’t, have a voice.”
Political science assistant professor Morris Levy, however, warned against drawing definitive conclusions about the reasons for the results of the election based on voter turnout when all the data has not yet been collected. Much of the speculation is just that, and according to Levy, diagnosing specific ethnic groups’ failure to turn out to vote as being the cause of the outcome is premature. He said, however, that the way the polls were read may have misled voters.
“The polls were wrong in this case about the outcome, but they weren’t that dramatically or ridiculously wrong about how the popular vote would turn out,” Levy said. “I think before we suggest that something terribly unexpected happened here relative to what the polls were showing, we need to know more.”

Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanOnline organizer · Billy Vela, director of El Centro Chicano, is one of the authors of a letter that asks USC administrators to declare the University a “sanctuary campus” for undocumented students, staff and their families.
An online letter asking USC administrators to declare USC a “sanctuary campus” for undocumented students, staff and family members has garnered nearly 3,500 signatures. The letter, which was addressed to President C. L. Max Nikias, Provost Michael Quick and Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, follows numerous declarations by President-elect Donald Trump stating that he plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants currently residing in the United States.
The authors of the document include professors George Sanchez, Jody Agius Vallejo, Manuel Pastor and Oliver Mayer and El Centro Chicano Director Billy Vela. 
“Immigrants and their children are a vital part of society,” the letter stated. “[Trump’s] policies will break up families, devastate communities, and have lasting consequences on the civic vitality and economic growth of our city, region, state and nation.”
The authors wrote that by becoming a sanctuary campus, USC will follow Mayor Eric Garcetti’s statement that Los Angeles will remain a sanctuary city in the case that the president-elect and his cabinet carry out deportations. 
Noha Ayoub, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, said that she signed the petition because she views it as a protection of human rights.
“The right to an education and political amnesty is a human right that should not be contingent on a vote,” Ayoub said. “I firmly believe that people have a right to move freely in order to ensure their own safety even if that movement isn’t always ‘legal.’”
In a sanctuary city, there are policies in place that prevent law enforcement from prosecuting undocumented immigrants. The Los Angeles Times reported that in 1979, Los Angeles became the first city in the U.S. to offer sanctuary to undocumented immigrants.
The letter stipulates that by declaring itself a “sanctuary campus,” USC would not allow authorities to enter campus and would not report the immigration status of its students, staff and their families if asked to provide that information.
Quick wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan that USC values diversity among its students, faculty and staff, but did not state whether the University would accept the requests listed in the letter.
“We will continue to be guided by our Principles of Community, which affirms USC as a safe and compassionate place representing a rich diversity of beliefs, identities and experiences,” Quick wrote. “To that end, I want to assure the USC community that we will continue to uphold current law and University policies. We will consider any future changes with our community’s best interests at the forefront.”
Antoinette Bailey, a freshman majoring in Middle East studies and global studies, said she signed the letter because of the impact it would bear on undocumented students’ education.
“We’re in college, and there’s already so much we have to worry about: our grades, extracurriculars, careers, student loans — the list could go on and on,” Bailey said. “The last thing students need is to be burdened by fear of deportation when they have already long established themselves in this country.”
The letter concluded by quoting an email that Quick sent to the student body following the outcome of the presidential election. Quick stated that “all of us are responsible for creating a university community of inclusion, equity, and justice,” and the organizers of the letter said that this call to action can be honored by declaring USC a sanctuary campus. 
Lynn Wang, a junior majoring in environmental studies, said that the petition’s existence is progress within itself.
“At the very minimum, this has started some discussion regarding this topic,” Wang said. “I hope that this letter starts conversation about the resources available to undocumented students.”
Right.   
Please don’t. Stop enabling this behavior. 
This is so ridiculous.  Democrats (particularly those in California) live in such a bubble and are totally out of touch with reality, the law, and much of America.  Don’t Democrats understand that they didn’t lose this election because their message wasn’t presented broadly or clearly enough…. they lost the election because their message was REJECTED.
There should be NO sanctuary for someone here illegally.  Period.  I am a first generation immigrant myself.  My family came here legally, through tremendous financial sacrifice.  What a total insult to people like myself when we reward or support those who choose not to follow the law.
The FACT is that the United States has some of the most generous and welcoming immigration policy in the world.  Most nations don’t even come close in their acceptance of new immigrants.  Thousands upon thousands of new U.S. citizens are sworn in each year.  Ironically, the vast majority of those new citizens are Hispanic or Latino… yet, Hispanics and Latinos are the most vocal in complaining about our immigration system.  It’s quite disgusting really.  Shameful in fact.
As a young, first generation immigrant, I was not able to attend USC without adding my immigration information to countless forms (alien registration number, etc).  It was a time when people here illegally acknowledged they were not in compliance with the law, lived humbly and quietly, understanding the limitations of their presence in the U.S., and acknowledging the consequences if they were caught.  Well those days are apparently over.  Illegal immigrants now have become militant, aggressive, dangerous, proud, and emboldened by policies of the Left.  They march with signs reading “Undocumented & Unafraid” (if they’re written in English at all).  They march with Mexican flags.  They enroll in public programs, they get driver’s licenses, and yes.. they enroll in our schools.  They totally bypass the laws… probably haven’t even heard of an education visa.  They literally have no shame.
Trump himself may be a clown, but his election is a sound rejection of the Leftist policies that have led to an emboldened illegal population in our country.  Many in America are sick of it.  ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS NOT A VICTIMLESS CRIME.  It impacts our society and communities in many ways that are not simply “positive”.  And think about this:  Illegal immigrants have children.  Those children are U.S. citizens who are born into an untenable and precarious situation that is NOT the fault of America, but of their parents.  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SPLIT FAMILIES, NOT OUR GOVERNMENT.  It all has to stop.  Law and order must be restored, and we can not reward those in the country illegally with any sort of “sanctuary”.
i was two years working through the labyrinth of US immigration policies-process so I could land in america and attend USC with my green card.  Trump says “a big beautiful wall…and a big beautiful door where (properly vetted) immigrants can walk through…”
OK. Empathy and caring for the illegal immigrants who are having a tough time and often living in real fear of being caught and deported. Some also have fear of having families separated as some family members are legally in the US and some are not. Yes, a humane and decent action for people seeking a better life in our country, a beacon to many for centuries, including all four of my grandparents around 1900.  
But how to separate the coyotes, dangerous criminals, drug cartel members and so on from the decent immigrants? Yes, a small number, but how do we assure that we are not protecting them in the sanctuary?

The USC men’s basketball program has developed a reputation for consistently possessing one of the youngest rosters in the Pac-12 Conference, and the 2016 season will be no different. This season, nine of the roster’s 14 players are underclassmen in eligibility — the team only boasts one senior who is on scholarship. 
USC’s youth was a strong point in the team’s perfect opening weekend, which included victories over visiting Montana and Omaha at the Galen Center. Trojan underclassmen have accounted for approximately 60 percent of the team’s offensive output through the first two games — scoring 93 of USC’s 157 points thus far. 
In USC’s 82-72 victory over Omaha Sunday, redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron, a transfer from Louisville, scored a team-high 16 points and reeled in four rebounds. 
“Shaqquan is in a situation now where he is being relied upon for the first time in his career,” Enfield said regarding Aaron, who sat out the entirety of last season after transferring from Louisville. “He is being relied upon to do things he has never done before — defend at a high level, rebound the ball, score and help our team win games.”
Aaron also recorded a career-high 17 points in USC’s season-opening 75-61 victory over Montana Friday. 
Sophomore forward Chimezie Metu recorded his first double-double of the season Sunday against Omaha (15 points, 11 rebounds). Metu also recorded a game-high five blocks on Sunday. A breakaway dunk from Metu late in the second half against Omaha was a nail-in-the-coffin play which helped clinch the victory for the Trojans. 
In the opening weekend of their collegiate careers, freshman guards Jonah Mathews, De’Anthony Melton and forward Nick Rakocevic saw significant playing time against both Montana and Omaha. 
Melton — who scored 13 points on 4-of-7 shooting Sunday — was one of five double-digit scorers for USC in its victory against Omaha. Melton also recorded a game-high three steals on Sunday. 
“I want to get as many deflections as possible on defense,” Melton said. “I just want to limit their [opponent’s] number of possessions and increase the number of ours.”
Rakocevic scored seven points and grabbed seven rebounds against Omaha; his free throw made in the second half put USC ahead 54-53, giving the team a lead they would not surrender for the remainder of the contest.
Mathews scored four points against Omaha Sunday, and recorded the first field goal of his collegiate career. 
PASSING OF THE GUARD
When former USC guard Julian Jacobs declared for the NBA Draft last spring, ending his career as a Trojan a year early, there were great doubts about the future of the backcourt for the team. 
Through the first two games, the trio of Aaron and juniors Elijah Stewart and Jordan McLaughlin has filled in well for the team at the guard slots. 
On Friday night against Montana, Stewart scored a game-high 30 points against the Grizzlies on 6-of-12 shooting from the field; he also reeled in seven rebounds. 
“I didn’t have to take that many shots tonight because I got to the free throw line a lot,” said Stewart, regarding his performance Friday night. “I’ve been trying to work on my efficiency, especially having so many options in this offense.”
On Sunday, Stewart scored 11 points, while recording four assists and seven rebounds. 
McLaughlin, who led USC in scoring last season (13.4 PPG), scored 12 points on Sunday and recorded a team-high five assists.
Through the first two games of the season, Aaron has averaged 16.5 points and 5.5 rebounds.
SURPASSING THE SLOW START
On Friday night against Montana, USC overcame a slow start that put it behind double digits against the Grizzlies early on in the second half. After falling behind  14-3, the Trojans finished the half on a 31-16 run that gave them the lead entering the half en route to a double-digit victory. 
Against Omaha Sunday, USC trailed the Mavericks 37-34 at the half. In the second half, USC outscored Omaha 48-35 and outrebounded the Mavericks, 28-19, in its come-from-behind victory. 
METU DEVELOPING
As a freshman last season, Metu undertook a significant role for a USC team that appeared in the NCAA Tournament last season for the first time since 2011. In his first year, Metu had a team-high 54 blocks, while averaging 6.4 PPG and 3.8 RPG off of the bench. 
Issues with foul trouble limited Metu to an average of 18.5 minutes per game played during his freshman season. 
Enfield notes that Metu has worked on this aspect of his game — limiting the fouls that come with his block-happy style of play. 
Metu has also made efforts toward diversifying his offensive skill set, especially developing his abilities as a mid-range shooter. Last season, Metu was a 51 percent shooter from the free throw line. Through two games, Metu has shown early signs of improving his foul shots, shooting 9-of-11 from the stripe thus far.
“I worked out a lot this summer, making sure I’m able to knock down [mid-range shots] effectively,” Metu said. “It’s helped my game a lot. Now I can pump-fake, drive to the rim, and get fouled. I’m shooting a lot more free throws these first two games than I did all last season … It’s all helped me open up my game.”
The problem with this program is there is no respect from the media or country at large. Not one vote in the poll
this week. Need to schedule a couple of ooc teams who are identified as a basketball school to earn some recognition
with a win. All these home games vs. no names doesn’t test the teams strength & weaknesses.

At first glance, junior driver Matteo Morelli is not the most imposing figure. For water polo players, he stands at a modest 6-foot-1 and weighs 170 pounds. He does not possess the height of a Grant Stein or the bulk of a Blake Edwards. Yet, what he lacks in stature, Morelli makes up for in pure skill and determination. 
Over a stretch of three games from Oct. 27 to Nov. 6, he was the Trojans’ most valuable player, netting a dizzying 10 goals, including four goals and two assists against No. 2 Cal. Third in scoring on the team and eighth in the MPSF with 36 (just one behind Edwards and Stein), Morelli will be key in the long road of postseason games to come. 
When Morelli first arrived at USC by way of Naples, Italy, he was understandably apprehensive. 
“It was kind of scary at the beginning,” Morelli said. “It was completely different. The culture, the food … it was my first experience far from home without my family.” 
He found solace in the pool, his home since his family influenced him to start playing water polo 11 years ago. 
“I started because my dad played water polo,” Morelli said. “My family is a water polo family. From my father’s side to my mother’s side. They trained me in the water.” 
Now three seasons and 109 goals into his collegiate career, Morelli has not only adapted to the American culture but has also become a star player for the Men of Troy. After performing so excellently in last month’s 10-6 win over Cal, many are starting to take notice. He subsequently captured his first career MPSF Player of the Week award.
“It was a great honor,” Morelli said. “I think I deserved it this time. A couple of other guys from the team have gotten it this season. I think we have the most MPSF Players of the Week this year.” 
One noticeable aspect about Morelli is that he would much rather reference his teammates than himself. For example, when asked about scoring his 100th career goal, he talks instead about how he prefers to set others up for scoring opportunities. This tendency is indicative of a larger culture that emphasizes team play over individualism. In fact, the Men of Troy’s camaraderie is so strong that when Morelli responded “probably” to having better chemistry in the pool with Lachlan Edwards than Lachlan has with his own brother Blake — who is also on the team — he was only half kidding. 
Many would be intimidated entering last weekend’s matchup against the undefeated No. 1 UCLA — the large crowd, the intense rivalry, the national implications, the Pac-12 Network cameras surrounding the pool deck. However, Morelli seemed to welcome the challenge that awaited. 
“I like the pressure a lot,” Morelli said. “I like the televised games too and also because my family in Italy can watch me play. I feel like I play better when they watch me play.”
Beyond USC, Morelli is uncertain about his future. He may return to Italy and attempt to qualify for the National Team (he has already made appearances for the Youth National Team), or he may stay in the United States and pursue a career in his major of business administration. For now though, Matteo is fully focused on the goal at hand: competing in both the MPSF and NCAA tournaments. 
“Overall, we’re doing great,” said Morelli about his team’s recent string of success. “We still need to improve obviously but we are on a good streak right now and hopefully we are not going to lose any more games.”

Last week was crazy, to say the least. I covered the election and the ensuing protests for Annenberg Media. It was a great experience sitting in the control room of our studio, surrounded by some great friends while producing about seven hours of live television. It was a really unique working experience — nothing like I’ve had as a sports reporter. 
In all of the hubbub of political reporting that I was around, I needed a break. When I say I needed a break, I don’t mean turning away and ignoring the vast political divide that’s consuming our country on a nationwide level and the relationships of those around me. I just needed a detox. Something that would allow me to slow the onslaught of political news that I was consuming from work, social media, television and my friends and family. My brain was on overdrive and a crash was coming any second. I knew that I needed something to get away, something else that I could dedicate my thoughts to for a short period of time that was far away from the political realm. So, I thought, what better way than to turn to sports?
The anticipation was palpable on Saturday morning, and I wasn’t even in Seattle. My day started with a USC sport, but it wasn’t football. The No. 2 USC Men’s Water Polo team hosted No. 1 undefeated UCLA to close out their MPSF regular season. The Trojans pulled off the upset to end UCLA’s 57-game win streak that dated back to last season. Any win over the Bruins is a great way to start one’s day. 
After the action in the pool, the No. 7 Women of Troy took to the soccer pitch to open their first round game of the NCAA Tournament against Eastern Washington University. USC roared out to a 3-0 lead in the first half courtesy of two goals from senior midfielder Morgan Andrews and one from junior midfielder Nicole Molen. While the Eagles scored a goal in the second half, it was USC’s victory all the way. As a Trojan fan, I was feeling pretty good. 
Then, USC women’s volleyball started off its match against Cal up in Berkeley. After a close first set against the Bears, USC quickly put them away to get the three-set sweep. 
All of this happened before the kickoff of the football game. After having gone through all these victories, I was beyond ready and excited for the kickoff. I fully believed in USC’s ability to pull off the upset. 
What transpired during the roughly three-and-a-half hours on the gridiron was amazing. While the Trojans made some mistakes and missed some coverages, their ability to fight back and hold the lead for nearly the entire game gave me flashbacks of the Trojan team I grew up loving. Every facet of the Trojans’ game was something to marvel at. They kept their penalty number low, held the Huskies to 17 rushing yards and the offense put up 400 yards behind a Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week performance from Darnold. Jackson had a game himself with two huge interceptions on Browning. It was overall a beautiful USC football game. The feeling was euphoric when I was able to hear the “We Are ’SC” chants clearly through the TV. 
Saturday was the best USC sports day I could possibly ask for. Every team that played while representing cardinal and gold won. There was really no better way to finish off my week sportswise. It refreshed my brain and readied me for the swarm of news that came in on Sunday. 
By taking in the revelry of USC sports, I was in no way ignoring or trivializing the political distress many in our country are facing nor the political victory the other half is celebrating. Sports just allowed me to take a step back and remember that there are other things in the world than the U.S. presidential election and its outcome, to remember that life goes on. The sun rose on Wednesday morning — as it does every day — for every American, regardless of who they did or didn’t vote for. 
Our country has a deep fissure rooted beyond just the results of the election, but in a time of such discord, sports can provide a relief — a break from everything that’s going on in the world. Sports can be bigger than themselves, and in this current climate, sports can bring people together when everything else is tearing them apart.

Nick Entin | Daily TrojanCold-blooded leader · Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold did not back down from the Huskies’ vaunted defense in Saturday’s upset.
After a stellar performance in USC’s upset of No. 4 Washington on Saturday, redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week. 
Darnold threw for 287 yards on 23-of-33 passing for two touchdowns. Both were impressive throws to the back of the end zone — he hit senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers after waiting patiently in the first quarter and then in the fourth quarter, Darnold threaded the needle to sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe to give the Trojans a 24-13 lead.
“I don’t question Sam anymore,” Imatorbhebhe said after the game. “I know he’s going to put it right where I can catch it, so it’s my job to catch it. He can make pretty much every throw on the field.” 
Darnold has been making the right throws this season, going 6-1 since taking over the starting job from redshirt junior Max Browne after the Stanford loss. On the season, Darnold has accrued 2,162 yards passing for 22 touchdowns, a USC freshman season record. His 68.1 percent completion percentage is seventh in all of college football and his quarterback rating of 165.8 ranks eighth in the nation. 
He outdueled Heisman Trophy contender Jake Browning on Saturday in USC’s stunning road win, earning him Pac-12 honors. Darnold did not seem fazed by Washington’s defense, which is nicknamed “Death Row” and allowed the fewest yards of total offense in the Pac-12 coming into the game.
“I’ll be honest with you, we thought that was probably the second best defense we’ve played all year, next to Alabama. And a secondary that we feel is elite,” head coach Clay Helton said.
Darnold will look to extend his record to 7-1 next week against UCLA.

Four-star quarterback recruit Jack Sears announced on Sunday his decision to decommit from Duke University and instead commit to play at USC in 2017. 
The 6-foot-3, 200-pound dual-threat decided enroll early at USC for the spring semester.
“I have the utmost respect and admiration for [Duke head coach David] Cutcliffe, the entire coaching staff and Duke University,” Sears said to 247Sports. “I wish them nothing but success in the future. I am now a USC Trojan and look forward to starting classes in January.”
Out of San Clemente High School — which is also redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold’s alma mater — Sears is rated as the No. 5 pro-style quarterback in the nation and the No. 16 player out of California.
With a playoff football game on Friday against Heritage High School in the CIF D-II quarterfinals, Sears could add on to his already impressive 4,572 yards, 61 touchdowns and 359 completions through the air, and 1,841 yards and 19 touchdowns on the ground.
It’s no surprise that after a junior season that featured 37 touchdown passes and just two interceptions, Sears received numerous offers from top programs like Florida State, Utah and Washington.
Coincidentally, Sears joins fellow USC tight end Tyler Petite as the second Trojan in three years to commit to Duke and then switch commitments as signing day neared.
Sears joins a stacked Southern California recruiting class that features five-star running back Stephen Carr and four-star offensive linemen Alijah Vera-Tucker and Brett Neilon.
By enrolling early, Sears will be able to participate in spring and summer camps without academic hindrance.
Besides Darnold, USC also has more young quarterbacks in freshmen Thomas Fitts, Matt Fink and Holden Thomas. Sears’ road to starting at USC could be challenging, but not impossible.

An elegant and contained examination of a woman under the spotlight, Jackie is a picture as refined as the former First Lady herself. Directed by Pablo Larrain, the film depicts the events of the week following John F. Kennedy’s assassination through the eyes of his widow, Jackie Kennedy. Filmed with an almost unnerving degree of subtlety and ingrained with deep psychological drama, Jackie is a startlingly intimate portrait of one woman’s grapple with grief under an entire nation’s watch. The titular role is played by Natalie Portman in one of the most striking performances of the year.
Jackie is structured around a now-infamous interview between Jackie and a journalist, played by Billy Crudup, conducted one week after her husband was killed. The unnamed reporter interviewed Jackie in her quiet Massachusetts home, but he did not treat her as everyone else does, as a fragile and naive young widow. Instead, the reporter asked Jackie honest and brutal questions about her children, the funeral arrangements she chose for her husband and the tragic day in Dallas. Through flashbacks, the audience witnesses the week unfold along with Jackie’s grasp on what’s true in her world. Though the interview-leading-to-flashbacks structure is overused, Jackie is a film so gracefully told that the trope becomes lost in both the simplicity of the story and Portman’s jaw-dropping performance.
Portman’s portrayal of Jackie Kennedy can only be described as remarkable. With every intonation and light-footed step, the actress opened for the audience a window inside Jackie’s state of mind in the days after her husband is killed — a state of mind that continues to this day to mystify the American public. Why did Jackie decide to plan the funeral as an extravagant horse-drawn procession through eight blocks of Washington? Why did she decide to parade her children under public eye during this event? Why did she try to hold her husband’s skull together after he was shot in the head? The audience still doesn’t know. Portman still offered them incredible insight. 
Jackie is not a particularly intimidating woman, but that doesn’t mean she’s not strong-willed. When she is First Lady, Jackie draws her spirit off showcasing the bounty of her husband’s office. It means as much to Jackie to look and feel presidential as to be married to the President himself. So when John F. Kennedy (or Jack, as Jackie calls him) is killed, it means the loss of her husband but also the loss of her title. If Jackie isn’t the First Lady anymore, then who is she?
Portman filled the role with impeccable nuance. She had a calm outward face brimming with hysteria, one that, in the aftermath of tragedy, led to questionable choices. And yet, Portman left no room for the audience to judge Jackie because they were immersed in her character. Though nervous and grieving, Portman was still regal in her portrayal of the iconic First Lady. The decisions she made in the days after the assassination — even if they were the wrong decisions — demonstrated Jackie’s need to hold her head up and demand respect for her husband’s title. And yet, this struggle for making meaning out of someone’s life translated easily to her own introspective dance with the devil. It was not just her husband’s future that Jackie mourned during the funeral. It was, in a way, also her own.
Jackie is less of a biopic than a psychological drama — one that at times veered into the disturbing. This is due in part to the film’s cinematography. Throughout most of the film, director of photography Stephane Fontaine utilizes center-framed shots. Though such a choice could feel unnatural, it works here because the attention is on Portman, and she is always surrounded by Jean Rabasse’s gorgeous production design. 
The film’s unique framing works in harmony with an unnerving score to create an uncanny, introspective effect. In one heartbreaking sequence, as Jackie walked through the White House alone, covered in her husband’s blood, it could almost be a scene from a horror film. But of course, historical poignancy works in tandem with cinematography and music to replicate Jackie’s damaged psyche. A natural grain and minimal lighting work to root the film in the real world.
Jackie is not trying to be an expansive film, and so it is curious why its third act unravels the way it does: the ending drags on as the audience grows restless. It was disappointing that the movie did not end as it played for most of its run time: tightly woven, neatly paced, with barely enough room for the audience to take a breath.
Aside from these setbacks, the film was a masterful portrait of Jackie Kennedy. In a year so fraught with political tension, it was quite poignant to see one of the most iconic First Ladies in American history struggle with and find solace in the midst of national tragedy.

Art is no longer a solely a product of higher truths, patronage and tradition. Today, it is experienced beyond the museum: Art is an active part of many Instagram feeds, plays a large role in product experiences and can be earned as a college degree.
 On Friday evening, USC and Los Angeles’ creative community gathered at the University Religious Center’s Fishbowl for an evening open gallery and speaker panel to discuss the role that art plays today. State of the Arts kicked off at 4 p.m. with various exhibits set up in the outdoor hub. Visitors casually browsed the open gallery, conversing with exhibitors and each other over food and relaxing, ambient music.
 Organized by Spark SC, State of the Arts was created to celebrate the intersectionality between art, technology and the spirit of creativity.
 “By hosting an art exhibition dedicated to showing off how the USC and L.A. community is pursuing grassroots ventures with art, we wanted to empower artists to market their own work,” said Priscilla Pan, Spark SC board member and the event’s lead organizer. “Our goal was to showcase underexplored pockets of creativity and inspire attendees to produce and act on their own ideas,”
 Among the exhibitors featured was Melisa Seah, a freshman majoring in business administration, with her clothing line, “Classic Revivals.” Seah curates clothing with the goal of sustainability, integrating the art of taste in fashion with eco-friendly and entrepreneurial intentions. Utilizing art for impact was a common theme in the exhibitions: Artist Laura Kg also uses a range of media forms, from digital to traditional, to communicate issues of social justice. Her work in the gallery utilized palm trees to discuss these personal and historical identities.
 While some of the work on display opened up a conversation about social commentary, other exhibitors specifically explored the use of technology and its empowering capacity. Samir Ghosh, a projectionist and senior majoring in cognitive science, created a digital simulation of pollen floating in the wind for his exhibition. His work served as the event’s key digital piece, highlighting the role of tools in technology to create art. AIGA USC, the campus chapter of the professional association for designers, contributed a life-sized magazine cover photo backdrop to the exhibition.
 The backdrop was modeled off Wired Magazine, but the title “Wired” was replaced with “Weird” to encourage creative, outside-of-the-box thinking. This piece served as a staple photo opportunity as well as the visual anthem for the whole event. As visitors directly interacted with the tech and culture magazine piece, they were reminded that the “state of the arts” is key to every conversation from ventures to social commentary.
 The evening wrapped up with an hour-long speaker panel to open a dialogue about art’s role in the community. With the onset of the digital age and a certain democratizing of technological resources, artistic creation is increasingly present — this was the overarching theme of the panel conversation.
 Art is not only in movies and murals, but also in the visual and material design of restaurant experiences, as Armando De La Torre on the panel discussed. De La Torre is the co-founder of Guisados, a Mexican restaurant chain with three locations in Echo Park, Downtown and West Hollywood. De La Torre was joined by China Adams, a design professor in Roski, and Michael Chang, a senior majoring in fine arts, on the panel, and the discussion emphasized the overlapping nature of artistic production in every industry and mode of thinking.
 “In the past, labor was more expensive than materials,” De La Torre said. “Today, though, materials are more expensive than labor, and so choosing the right paper for your menus and tiles for your walls becomes that much more crucial.”
 Adams and Chang discussed the artistic process and its parallels to entrepreneurship, design and product decisions. Adams described the distinction between art and design, stating their different intentions.
 “Art is more about the process, while design uses the word iteration instead,” Adams said.
 Chang emphasized the parallels between the two, though, explaining that art and design were not mutually exclusive. He commented on his experience in designing for ventures, explaining how he now takes that ambitious, fast-paced “sprint” method to brainstorm, meditate on and create artwork.
 In a last discussion of the utility of artwork for the community, all three speakers championed the importance of process in their respective realms of design, business and fine arts. Adams had the last word, though, and said her biggest inspirations are her students because of how they consistently find new ways to communicate their artistic process, especially digitally. Though arts education is necessary for context and history, the process of art and creativity is democratic.
 As the panel concluded with this empowering sentiment, the intent of the event became even clearer. The artistic process is available to everyone. With the growing accessibility of resources comes this democracy of art: Today and tomorrow it will serve as a tool for crafting experiences through products, media and even restaurant wall tiles. Art is ever-transforming, ever-progressing and absolutely everywhere.

For a while, I never truly ventured into the underground area of hip-hop, choosing to stick to better-known artists. However, I still knew of an underground artist here and there, but nothing substantial like an entire album. Considering I have specific taste in just about everything, you would probably think that the underground and I would get along like two peas in a pod — and you’d be right.
 One artist in particular always caught my eye, but I never got around to listening to him until this year. He goes by MF DOOM, and he manages to check off pretty much every box on my “must-have” list for a hip-hop artist. Authentic? Yep. Good flow? In spades. Production? Unique and original. That “it” factor? You betcha. Even if I wasn’t pleased with MF DOOM, I have his other personas to listen to, including: King Dumile, King Geedorah, Metal Fingers, The Supervillain, Viktor Vaughn and Zev Love X. In other words, this was a match made in heaven, and during a long drive in the summer, I listened to one of his best albums from start to finish for the first time.
 OPERATION: DOOMSDAY is a prime example of what happens when you give an artist the room they need to express themselves in a way that they feel best represents them and not their label. There’s so much personality in this album that it feels like I’m getting a private concert from DOOM himself every time I listen to it. Every tiny bit of his inner-workings coming out to create something that best represents him. His likes, his dislikes, his views and a version of himself that he created on an album without any interference from someone higher-up telling him what to do and how to be. He has the freedom to be who he wants to be as an artist, and while it’s not for everyone, it certainly got my attention.
 He seems to have a huge fixation for the late-’60s television series, Fantastic Four, and he splices dialogue of people talking about Doctor Doom or the mad villain himself into musical interludes and skits throughout the album. There’s an obvious parallel to the character Doctor Doom and his own rap persona, but the little bits of dialogue add that extra bit of flavor to the album that you didn’t know was missing. He’s able to turn his nerdy comic book love and give his music a personal twist that’s like a breath of fresh air. If you follow the skits closely enough, they actually tell a lot about how Viktor Vaughn, the artist’s real name, came to create his persona MF DOOM, but they’re fun enough to take at surface value too.
 MF DOOM’s production is often overlooked, which is travesty in my opinion. These tracks aren’t only great for him to rhyme over, but they’re good as standalone tracks too. Some are smooth and pleasing to the ears like “Rhymes Like Dimes,” “Gas Drawls,” “?” and “Doomsday,” which are heavily influenced by soul and old-school R&B. Others are a little out there like “Tick, Tick…” and “Hey!,” but are fresh and innovative, really showcasing MF DOOM’s unique approach to his music. “Hey!” is especially important, since it’s based on a sample from the opening seconds of The New Scooby-Doo Movies intro.
 His flow and rhyming are off-kilter, and it’s noticeable enough for anyone to take note of when they first listen to it. However, as odd as they are, they’re the final ingredients to the concoction that makes MF DOOM what he is. His raspy voice is a match made in heaven for his raps, and anyone else trying to do what he’s doing on this album would sound like a mess. I’m amazed “Doomsday” isn’t more celebrated, as it’s one of the best hip-hop songs I’ve ever heard. Then again, if it was more popular, it wouldn’t be underground, and I wouldn’t have the pompous satisfaction of knowing a musical artist a lot of people haven’t even heard of.
 After being introduced to MF DOOM, I started to venture more into underground hip-hop. He started me down a long path of discovering an infinite library of new sounds and artists just waiting to be found. I’m thankful, since I have plenty of new music to get around to, but it’s also a curse. It’s like when you throw everything that has at least a four-star rating in your Netflix list, with so many options you don’t even know where to begin. Regardless, I’m beginning to expand my taste in music, which is never a bad thing. I definitely have a certain type when it comes to hip-hop, but it’s never a bad thing to have some diversity in just about anything, especially in music.

Media representation is often incorrect and hollow — however, for many religious minorities, this can have a substantial impact on their quality of life and treatment by others.
Rhonda Roumani, a contributing fellow at USC’s Center for Religion and Civic Culture, published an Op-Ed in the Los Angeles Times earlier this week which included a very personal example of the Islam most Muslims practice, as opposed to the violent radical “Islam” that many Americans perceive. Roumani’s dilemma rests wholly within the realm of media presentation. She praises a children’s show for portraying Eid Mubarak with the childlike happiness and spirit that the average Muslim American would want, and notes the difference between this program and the violence published by news media concerning “Islamic” terrorists (whether or not to call them radical Muslims or not Muslim at all is a debate in and of itself). Media portrayal of Islam is fractured to say the least. However, fractured portrayal and vilification of religious minorities has been consistent throughout American history — even regarding groups of primarily white believers, and even under the umbrella of Christian denominations. In truth, Muslim Americans are not the only religious minority that still experience stigmatization and prejudice: Mormon Americans share a similar experience.
Unfortunately, media portrayal is not fair, and never has been. Muslims are living in a time of American fear of radical terrorism, and often become scapegoats to alleviate this fear. What seems to be forgotten, however, is that they are not the first religious minority to be wet-mounted onto a slide and thrust under the microscope of the “average” American. In 1838, Missouri Gov. Lilburn Boggs issued what was known as the Extermination Order. He listed all members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (more colloquially known as Mormons) as enemies and called for their extermination. It was this act that prompted the Mormons to trek to present-day Utah (Mexico at the time). Despite the hardship and unfair treatment this religious minority faced in a land of supposed religious freedom, Mormons were some of the first victims of negative media representation through film. Young Mormons today in church are told harrowingly truthful accounts of men, women and children who sacrificed their lives to make the journey to the Utah Valley. 
Yet, in the early 20th century, anti-Mormon films were common: Trapped by Mormons, Married to a Mormon and A Victim of the Mormons. Despite their adverse past, though, today Mormons are considered to be some of the biggest beneficiaries of white privilege — to an unlikable level (such as former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney). Yet they come from a time they were ordered to be exterminated like termites from the Puritan suburban home of the “average” American. Unlike the example Roumani uses, there will likely never be a children’s show depicting the importance the Mormon holiday, Pioneer Day, despite members making up 1.6 percent of the U.S. population (compared to Islam’s 0.9 percent). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has found its place in vulgar and untruthful accounts of the actual religion — the musical The Book of Mormon and the HBO show Big Love. 
Who knows — in a few decades when the number of misrepresented religious minorities reaches a majority, people might start to realize that the news coverage and movies get it wrong most of the time when it comes to portraying issues like these. Hopefully by then, we will have learned that how the media portrays religious minorities is almost always inaccurate and the multiculturalism that we all want, in theory, has always been there, waiting in the real world, away from news screens. 
Some excellent points in Hickman’s essay. Perhaps the villain here is the easy tendency to generalize. Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Confucianists and the other major religions do not seem to have ferocious factions that wage jihad against Western civilization, demanding the enslavement, forced conversion or murder of unbelievers. 
Yes, correct, that horror does not represent Muslims in general! But it is all too easy to generalize fear and revulsion from that jihad minority onto the greater body of Muslims. So what can Americans or Westerners do? Of course, not generalize that Muslims are mujahadeen. Fair, right, yes, but not easy. The problem will remain until jihad is no longer the terror of the Western world, and unfortunately, that will probably demand that Muslims take sides against the murderous fanatics of their own faith.
“Muslims are living in a time of American fear of radical terrorism, and often become scapegoats to alleviate this fear.”
During the Iran/Iraq War one million Muslims died at the hands of Muslims.
During the current Syrian War Muslims are brutalizing and killing other Muslims ceaselessly.
During the Sudan Genocide Arab-looking Muslims killed blacker Muslims without remorse.
Every day Muslims kill other Muslims at crowded village markets, at mosques, in their homes and most anywhere imaginable.
+++
Seems to me Muslim’s real fear should stem from fear of other Muslims much more than from infidels.
And again, a writer is citing Governor Boggs’ “extermination order” without understanding its context.  Mary Cate Hickman is no doubt bright enough, but would do well to do some research.
The first call for “extermination” came from Mormon leader Sydney Rigdon on July 4th (some three months before Boggs’ order) when he spoke before agitated Mormons and said, in part, ” And that mob that comes on us to disturb us; it shall be between us and them a war of extermination; for we will follow them till the last drop of their blood is spilled, or else they will have to exterminate us: for we will carry the seat of war to their own houses, and their own families, and one party or the other shall be utterly destroyed.”
A read of the Wikipedia entry on Missouri Executive Order 44 gives good background.
But Mormons love to play the victim card even tot his day.  Now they want to continue their prejudices against LGBT people by claiming their religious freedom is being jeopardized by those that call on them to realize people aren’t all like them and deserve to be treated with fairness and equality, regardless of their sexual orientation.

I cried. I know many people did, so I’m not ashamed to admit it at this point. I started out simply scared, clutching my phone with white knuckles as I frantically refreshed Fivethirtyeight.com. The predictions coming in were increasingly bad for us Democrats, and I started cursing out Nate Silver and lamenting each state that turned red. I thought this might happen — I’d feared that they had underestimated the white working class vote — but my suspicions were confirmed as that nightmarish red bled across the electoral map. 
I still didn’t cry at that point. But then, I thought of Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton, a dedicated public servant who had sacrificed 30 years of her life for public service; Hillary Clinton, who was forced to sand off any offending quirks in her personality to appease the American voter — and then was told she was too “robotic”; Hillary Clinton, who had worked so hard for the United States and then had to sit there as she was told that America had preferred a virulently xenophobic tangerine moron to her. Then, I cried — out of anger, out of a profound sense of loss. 
Except the truth is that most of that America did not prefer a screaming misogynist yam. Instead, the white working class in a few key swing states, after decades of shooting themselves in the foot by voting for the Republican Party, decided to do it one more time. Once everything is counted, Clinton is expected to win the popular vote by a sizeable margin — but thanks to the Electoral College, we end up with a silenced majority and a fascist Home Depot bucket sitting in the Oval Office. 
To make a gross understatement, we lost. We don’t have a lot of options left to us: we have lost the House of Representatives, and we’re two or three seats away from Senate control. All that’s left now is the filibuster, which is not as comforting as it seems. And so, we find ourselves asking how we got here. 
Think pieces will pick over the carcass of the campaign in the coming months, but they’re not entirely relevant now. We Democrats have some serious systemic issues that we have yet to resolve, and which would have continued regardless of a Hillary Clinton presidency. So here we are: ruled by quite possibly a madman, who pursues Vladimir Putin’s affection like a lovestruck schoolgirl, and a Congress that will blindly rubber-stamp his every notion. It is in a system like this that we will face our greatest challenge: we will have to learn to have backbone. 
Democrats have become a party of compromise, a party of bowing to Republican pressure. We’ve refused to stand our ground, gutting vital pieces of legislation such as the Affordable Care Act, and letting the Republican Party run roughshod over our government. We’ve allowed them to be obstructionist and demanding, and we’ve suffered. This defeat is a culmination of that: not pushing our social programs, not defending unions, ignoring immigration reform. All of these hurt us, and may continue to hurt us unless we show some integrity.
The stakes are much higher here: women, people of color, Muslims, immigrants, journalists even — all of these people stand to get crushed under Trump’s ill-fitting boot. We have to encourage our lawmakers to fight back and stand tall against Trump’s fascist disregard for our Constitution and our values. We have to hold the upcoming administration accountable, and we have to stop the media from normalizing this deplorable melted marshmallow. 
Standing up for our ideals will be our survival tactic for the time being. We can’t afford to take a “wait and see” approach here, and we can’t afford an extended grieving period for our nation.
Don’t get sad. Get mad. And we’ll see what changes come in 2018.
Noah Suárez-Sikes
B.A. History ’19
In 2008 I worked with millions of other democrats to help get Pres. Obama elected and to help him win majorities in both house and senate as well as helping the democrat party win as many state governor seats as posdible so we could take our country back from 12 years of REAGAN-BUSH and another 8 years of BUSH-CHENEY extreme right wing abuse and damage to the economy and the shipping of Anerican working class jobs to 3rd world countries! 
We won big in November 2008 and I was hoping that the American people would be smart enough to never again let CON MEN FASCIST extreme right wing people like REAGAN and BOTH BUSHES and their whole now FASCIST Republican Party ever hijack this country again!  I WAS WRONG!
In August of 2008, the republicans unleashed a vicious army of brutally RACIST TEA PARTY FOOT SOLDIERS who ran wild all over America, maliciously smashing up and destroying every single town hall meeting that President Obama set up all over this country to explain his healthcare agenda to the public. When that happened I BEGGED the democrats to grow a backbone and fight back against the damn Tea Baggers because failure to do so would destroy everything we worked so hard for, a new government with a better future for the millions of us who are NOT filthy rich! Money for affordable healthcare, affordable housing and education and the return of manufacturing jobs and union benefits to THIS country! 
But all I ever got from the DNC was a single e-mail telling me that the Tea Party Republicans were nothing more than a nasty little bunch of HARMLESS crackpots who would surely go away if we “Good” Democrats just IGNORED them!  WRONG!
Bullies must be fought back against or else they will become even more harmful  and just as I feared, the tea party bullies used their SCOTUS majority to ram Citizens United down our throats as well as getting the five horrible men on the Supreme Court to destroy the voter protection law of 1964.
Again I begged the democrats to fight back. I warned them that failure to do so would cause the House and Senate majorities to be lost!
They did NOT fight back! Yet they kept sending me emails and letters requesting donations from me to KEEP THE HOUSE AND SENATE BLUE. I sent them back letters and emails telling them that if they wanted donations from me they had better grow a backbone and fight back instead of shamefully allowing the republican Bullies to stomp all over them!
They did NOT fight back so I refused to give them even one penny!  
Just as I feared the democrats not only shamefully LOST both house and senate in 2010 and 2014 because their base voters, the real progressive people just HATE COWARDS who shamefully allow republican bullies to stomp all over them and they will NOT come out on election day to vote for COWARDS!  The result is LOW VOTER Turnout which is all the republican bullies need to seize power! 
They still don’t get it!  
The loss of the senate has had terrible consequences now for every single democratic PERSON in this country!  It has enabled MITCH McCONNELL, a horrible man just as bad as DONALD TRUMP to DESTROY President Obama’s constitutional right to have his nominated man, a decent judge, MERRICK GARLAND given a fair hearing and probable confirmation to the Supreme Court!  Now that TRUMP the FASCIST has seized power the supreme court will get a horrible religious fanatic added to it who WILL see to it that BOTH planned parenthood and LEGAL safe abortions are destroyed and the only birth control that women in this country will have is COAT HANGER ABORTIONS!
Evil flourishes because good people turn COWARDLY instead of fighting back!  
And the democrats should  have also realized that in today’s political atmosphere which is hostile to progressive people that the playing field between democrat and republican candidates, especially in presidential races is NOT FAIR AND EQUAL like it was in the days BEFORE REAGAN.
Republican candidates can be as malicious and despicable and corrupt as they like and even he guilty of committing all kinds of horrible crimes and still WIN ELECTIONS!
But if a democrat candidate has even the ghost of a  minor scandal connected to him or her they get full blown Viciosly DEMONIZED and CRUCIFIED by the news media even when what they are accused of are LIES
Because they don’t seem to know how to properly fight back! 
Democrats can only win when they nominate candidates who are SCANDAL FREE and have a high popularity rating among both progressives as well as centrist democrats and independent voters!  Barack Obama had those qualities 
Bernie sanders had those qualities and could have won 
Hillary Clinton was well qualified to be president but could NOT get rid of the BENGHAZI or the email scandals and she did NOT have the necessary high
Popularity rating that Bernie Sanders has!  She could NOT win in today’s FASCIST POISON ATMOSPHERE!
And now thanks to both the horrible Christo-Fascist corporate greedy re-THUG-Lican hijacking of this country all over again I AM sorry to have to say this but I am absolutely sure that FASCIST DONALD TRUMP and the whole brown shirted THUG FASCIST Republican Party in the house, senate and SCOTUS definitely WILL VERY SOON TURN AMERICA into the same nightmare GERMANY was in 1933-1945 because the “Democrats” turned COWARDLY instead of FIGHTING BACK against the Neo-Nazi Republicans when they should have,’BACK in AUGUST of 2009.
Now it’s TOO LATE   
You discussed nothing about the many issues within the democratic party and essentially used this to bash trump. 
Grow a backbone and look in the mirror
