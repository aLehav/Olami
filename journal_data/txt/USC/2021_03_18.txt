DJ, producer and songwriter Jalen Stokes — who goes by Leesto — was in the eighth grade when he saw electronic musician, record producer and DJ Dillon Francis mixing at his friend’s birthday party. 
Leesto, now a junior majoring in music production, grew up listening to Michael Jackson and ’90s R&B — not to mention the extensive history of music within his family. His father produced music in his younger years and his uncle DJed — both of which Leesto does now. But it wasn’t until he saw Francis perform that he began to seriously pursue music as a career.
“[I was drawn to] being able to create something from scratch,” Leesto said. “And … telling stories through music. I don’t think there’s any other platform or thing as a creator that I [could] express myself like that other than music production.” 
Once the Thousand Oaks native entered high school, Leesto started to take music production classes and DJ for neighbors’ get-togethers, high school parties, proms and, eventually, nightclubs.
“It’s just funny because I was doing this at 15 [years old], and I didn’t have a license yet,” Leesto said.
In freshman year, he marketed himself on Twitter and Instagram, filming and uploading videos of himself doing different mixes. His first gig was a birthday party for a neighbor who had just turned 50 years old. 
“I had to have a bunch of ’70s music. I didn’t even know how to set up stands or a speaker … so my uncle came and brought his stuff and showed me how to set stuff up,” Leesto said. 
As he booked more and more gigs, Leesto said he grew more aware of how he could connect with people through DJing. 
“[DJing] has always been more so about meeting and creating energies in the room,” Leesto said. “So [when] I get hit up for an event … [it’s] ‘Where are we trying to go tonight?’, like ‘What’s the energy on the dance floor?’… A lot of that is reading and identifying your crowd and what type of people are on the floor.” 
At first, his father assumed music was just a phase for Leesto and wanted him to focus on track & field and football, Leesto said. 
“Once [my parents] saw I was able to make my own business … they put a lot of faith in me,” Leesto said. “They at least knew that I was taking this seriously, that it was something that I wanted to keep pursuing and do. And I guess I’m thankful to have their backs, honestly, because I know a lot of people, if you say, ‘Yeah, my kid wants to get into the music industry,’ they start biting their nails and looking at you [like you’re] crazy.” 
After curating mixes for his high school basketball team’s halftime shows — “The students section would just go crazy,” he said — Leesto began to gain more attention from his peers, and eventually became involved in the party scene in Los Angeles, where he would DJ for hundreds of people. 
“The era of entertainment in Los Angeles, especially [for] … teenagers in high school was very interesting because they would market and throw parties on Instagram,” Leesto said. “I just never heard of anybody doing that in other places or other states.” 
However, it hasn’t always been smooth sailing. Leesto said there was a time when he was unaware he and another DJ were both booked for an event — him stationed inside and the other stationed outside. 
“Everybody was outside, it was honestly probably one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had,” Leesto said. 
“That moment on, I was like, ‘No, I’m not going to let this happen again.’ I have to be the best and I’m going to make sure that happens.” 
After practicing six hours straight everyday during the summer, Leesto was getting gigs for nightclubs like Nightingale Plaza and the Blind Dragon. 
Despite his success and growing reputation, Leesto said he sometimes struggles with the pressure. 
“Your performance and reputation and everything is all in one,” he said. “You’re up there and people are relying on you … for them to have a great night and at the end of the day, it’s based on how you play.” 
Singer Randy White, a frequent collaborator of Leesto’s and his friend since middle school, pointed to Leesto’s ability to engage the crowd as one of his major talents. 
“He’s really good at controlling the audience, the party and everything,” White said. “He plays all the really good, popular songs, but he also throws in all the bangers that people forget about. Everytime there’s a party and Leesto is the DJ, everybody knows there’s going to be good music.” 
After mixing music for years, Leesto also started to work on creating his own music with White. 
Their R&B and soul album “After Night, Before Morning,” which they began producing during Leesto’s senior year of high school, was released last year and featured 14 tracks. 
The album’s opening track, “Simulation” was the hardest for Leesto to write and produce due to its complexity. The track, Leesto said, centers around the idea that “you can be experiencing something positive or negative with someone or something … and it can feel so fake or so real that it can’t be real.” 
For the production of “Simulation,” Leesto went back to his roots — the ’90s R&B and soul music he had heard as a child — and went for a neo-soul vibe. Leesto also said he was inspired to add organ music to one of the album’s tracks after seeing a video where someone worked with the same instrument in their studio. 
“That night, I started making something, and [Randy and I] shared a notes page,” Leesto said. “We really wanted the song structure to be symmetric so that the first verse, the way the nouns and verbs and everything lays out, is the same in the second verse. We were very methodical of what words were going to go where in that track.” 
Leesto and White pulled from their personal experiences to craft each song out of a desire to “make something real, something different.” 
“[We were] honestly just making music based on events that would happen in either my life or his life,” Leesto said. “It’s kind of like that ‘12 a.m., you’re by yourself’ vibe of music.”  
Now that Leesto finished his first album and the pandemic’s halt on any parties and clubs he could DJ for, Leesto said he is focusing his efforts on producing and writing new music, as well as marketing his music through music placements. 
“I’ve been trying to get into the habit of organizing a lot of music … really trying to get [music] placements, and reach outside the community of people that I’ve been working with,” Leesto said. 
Leesto now also collaborates with new artists he’s met at USC, like his roommate Jonah Horne, who goes by Esso. Despite their different sounds — with Esso describing his music as “ethereal” and Leesto focusing more on R&B, soul and hip hop — Esso said he was immediately drawn to Leesto as a collaborator. 
“His creativity is just insane. I’ve never met anyone who’s as good as him at making stuff on the fly,” Esso said. 
Despite his new collaborations, Leesto and White still work together on music. 
“I think the collaboration works so well because we both have very creative minds. We both have our own thoughts and our own ideas and then we just bring them together [and] they mesh so well,” White said. “So [there’s] always a flow and [we’re] always [in] constant movement.” 
The music Leesto is currently working on is more hip hop heavy than “After Night, Before Morning” — “I’ve been listening to a lot of Juice WRLD,” he said — as well as more party-centric than the more intense production that characterized his first album. 
“The album I worked on before was like music for yourself if you’re either going through stuff or you just wanted to mellow,” Leesto said. “The music that I’m working on now, it’s like, ‘Let’s have fun. Let’s have a good time.’” 
Despite the more upbeat tone in his upcoming songs — which he plans to release sometime between March and April — Leesto still wants to draw from “real” experiences like he did in “After Dark, Before Morning.” Although the pandemic has encouraged him to focus on producing and writing music, he said that it’s also given him more time to contemplate his future career prospects. 
Since Leesto wears multiple hats — as a DJ, producer and a songwriter — he said he’s unsure of the specific music career he looks to pursue in the future. DJing for festivals is on his list, especially now that he’s done parties and clubs, but so is pursuing entertainment law or starting his own management label. 
“I’m just doing it day by day,” he said. “There’s going to be so much opportunity when COVID is done … you can probably imagine [how it will be] when things open up… I feel like it’s going to be a great arena to hop into.”

Beginning his stunt career in 1993, Koichi Sakamoto has taken on major roles in film and television series, specifically in Tokusatsu — a japanese genre featuring superheroes and special effects. The Japanese-born stunt actor and producer has even had involvement in the popular American show, “Power Rangers,” and many more projects that didn’t rely on high-budget Hollywood blockbuster effects and CGI.    
Some of his more recognizable works include “Ultra Galaxy Fight, The Absolute Conspiracy” and “Power Rangers Wild Force.” “Power Rangers Wild Force,” makes use of wire-fu style, a subgenre of kung fu movies where the stuntmen’s or actor’s skill is augmented with the use of wires and pulleys, while “Ultra Galaxy Fight, The Absolute Conspiracy” relies on green screens for its fight scenes. 
There are various differences between the two works, but each has its own appeal in fight coordination thanks to Sakamoto’s skills and budget limitations. 
For some background, “Power Rangers Wild Force,” is a show that revolves around live-action superheroes based on the tokusatsu genre and well-known episode, “Forever Red.” The episode involves the main protagonists from the current and previous seasons of power rangers teaming up to fight a new enemy. Through Sakmoto’s direction in wire-fu, each protagonist gets the chance to shine. 
The episode uses various high-flying and mid-air stunts, further emphasized by fast-forwarded and slow-motion shots. This experimentation of stunts would benefit future installments of “Power Rangers” seasons afforded a larger budget as Sakamoto would still experiment with more subgenres such as wire-fu — grabbing the attention of many. 
Sakamoto’s continued experimentation with wire-fu allowed him to grow more and more, both during and after his involvement in the ”Power Rangers” franchise. Tsuburaya Productions hired Sakamoto as a result to work on other shows when he returnedto Japan. 
Before choreographing “Ultra Galaxy Fight, The Absolute Conspiracy,” Sakamoto practiced fight coordination through scenes in “Kamen Rider” and the “Ultraman” franchises. For example, fights in “Kamen Rider Fourze” would involve Sakamoto’s experience in wire-fu from the “Power Rangers” franchise, drawing audiences into the stories and development of each episode. Works in “Ultraman,” such as the “Ultra Galaxy Fight” series, would allow Sakamoto to hone in on his hand-to-hand combat knowledge while incorporating them with the special effects used in the film. 
“Ultra Galaxy Fight, The Absolute Conspiracy” revolves around the “Ultraman” franchise — Ultramen being alien giants that fight giant monsters. For the “Ultraman” seasons, the story and themes would revolve around human characters who meet the main Ultraman of that season. However, “Ultra Galaxy Fight” does things a bit differently. 
“Ultra Galaxy Fight” was a spin-off mini-series unique not only because it was released on YouTube in both Japanese and English languages but also in that there weren’t any human characters or live-background, so Sakamoto relied heavily on green screen. Despite this difference from “Forever Red,” the series was able to captivate thousands of viewers of the official Ultraman YouTube channel through its fast-paced fight scenes and camera movements — working well with the short duration for each episode that provides complex storylines and a large ensemble of characters. 
Sakamoto taking advantage of his tools allows new audiences to learn about previous “Ultraman” seasons they might be interested in watching. His ability to adapt allows for more opportunities in creating fights for characters to express their personalities as well. 
Overall, Sakamoto does well in implementing a variety of techniques in low-budget works. Taking advantage of what he has while balancing it with the story and themes, Sakamoto’s work can be applied in other action media besides Tokusatsu.

This week marks the first year since the coronavirus pandemic turned USC’s student body on its head. For popular music majors  — a group of students whose curriculum relies heavily on in-person experiences —  at the Thornton School of Music, this change forced them to become innovative in the ways they create community. 
A year later, from new performance methods and programs to foster connections, the limitations of a virtual environment have not stopped students from doing what they do best: making music. 
Usually, first year showcases are performed at Tommy’s Place, but because of the coronavirus pandemic and performance classes being placed on hold for Fall 2020, the first virtual showcase was hosted Mar. 5 and garnered around 140 attendees. The event, carried out by the freshmen pop class, was open to the entire student body, past alumni, professors, faculty, staff and parents. 
The event featured four bands of students who learned a repertoire list of two to three songs — note for note — with various instruments over the beginning of the semester before recording their respective performances on Acapella, a sound engineering and songwriting app. 
Sophie Feldman, a junior majoring in popular music and psychology who attended the showcase, said she applauded the students’ performance and their adaptation to the virtual stage. 
“I really admire the freshman’s patience and commitment to really selling it because I watched their performance and they killed it; they were so engaging — they definitely made the best of a really unfortunate situation,” Feldman said. 
Freshman Maddi Lasker, who participated in the showcase, said she was quite impressed with the level of warmth, friendliness and initiative the upperclassmen took in welcoming the newcomers. 
“Online, it’s very easy for things to be awkward or you can be hesitant to other people, but [the upperclassmen] were so outgoing, so friendly and overall just so excited to get to know us,” Lasker said. 
Thornton’s Popular Music Performance program has always been a tight knit community, according to sophomore Maria McMillan, owing to its small size of around 25-30 people per cohort. 
As a small community, popular music students rely on one another not just for academics and performances but for social support and advice, junior Dominic Anzalone said. The major organizes each class into bands with different mixes of students and instruments — a difficult thing to do without in-person classes and with in-person performances postponed. 
McMillan said that she appreciated the guidance of upperclassmen popular music majors when she first entered the program as a freshman.
“You go from being one of the best on your instrument in your small hometown … to being surrounded by people who are all on your level, and it’s a really hard adjustment to make,” McMillan said. “I know for me it was really important to have juniors and seniors and even sophomores — just people who had been through exactly what I was going through to be able to talk to about it.”
Despite the setback of the coronavirus pandemic, McMillan and Anzalone still hosted a virtual pop party to welcome the virtual class. 
“There were a lot more [attendees] than I expected and lots of the freshmen came,” McMillan said. “We haven’t really had the chance to do [anything] online because of [coronavirus] so this was the first formal, informal gathering, organized by students from pop.”
Following the event’s success, the popular music cohorts continued the momentum of building bridges between members by starting a Big Brother, Big Sister program for freshmen to connect with upperclassmen.
Organized by students like Feldman over winter break, the mentorship program was designed to break the ice between older students and freshmen who would have to work together for the next few years. 
“Collectively as a class, we had talked about how bad we felt for the freshmen that they weren’t going to experience the physical pop family the way that we had,” Feldman said. “We didn’t want them to feel like they missed out on getting to know us because we also didn’t want to miss out on getting to know them.” 
The program matched upperclassmen with freshmen depending on things they had in common, including their musical instrument specialization, similar personality traits or their particular hometown. Around 20  pairs are currently formed, Feldman said. 
“I think it’s gone really well,” Feldman said. “Everybody who I have talked to that has gotten in touch with their pop big or little is really glad to have a new person in their life because it’s hard to find new people in your life right now.”
Anzalone, one of the upperclassmen who participated in the program as a mentor, said he wanted to help new students fit into the Trojan Family. 
“I think [these kinds of events] are necessary, generally because I’m very family-oriented and community-oriented,” Anzalone said. “[Thornton takes] the family-oriented thing seriously, and it’s easy to feel alone … I think having all of us to be able to support each other and be there for one another really means a lot.” 
For Feldman, while nothing can replace the communal feelings of physical rehearsals and showcases, virtual classes have also provided some unique opportunities. 
“I was basically forced to gain a sense of independence with recording my own voice and recording my own guitar playing,” Feldman said. “It’s also been great because logistically … I can have a session with somebody, no matter where they geographically are, as long as we know exactly what time to be there.” 
According to Laskar, the small group of freshmen continue to grow closer while still separated from one another in person. 
“I think it would have been very easy for us to not really be close with each other,” Lasker said “I actually feel like being online and all, undergoing these challenges and still having to overcome those has actually made us closer.” 
Although pop music students have faced the challenge of remote collaboration, Feldman said that the online programming demonstrates the innovative ways students can work together and point to the even stronger work they can produce when they are in person again. 
“I can’t wait to see the freshmen in person and see them play a showcase in real life,” Feldman said. “Because if they can handle performing the way that they’ve handled Zoom, I can’t even imagine what they’re going to be like in person.”

When Gabriella Schultze isn’t studying, she’s dancing. 
Schultze, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, balances a full course load with training for Ballet West, a dance company based in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Schultze is one of many students who have managed to find a silver lining during a global pandemic. Despite the challenges of a virtual learning environment, many students, such as Shultze, have utilized newfound schedule flexibility to pursue their interests outside of the classroom — from the creation of personal podcast projects to Instagram-based brands and professional ballet dancing.
“I don’t think I would have been able to make it work if it wasn’t for the online opportunity,” Schultze said. Her rehearsals and performances take place in-person, which is possible through precautions such as mask-wearing, distancing and temperature checks.
Schultze has been dancing since she was five years old and was offered her current contract in January 2020 before the onset of the pandemic. Due to her intense training schedule, Schultze initially didn’t think she could embark on her academic journey at USC while dancing. This was until the University announced its plans to go online for Fall 2020.
Currently, Schultze is rehearsing for her role as Cinderella in “The Glass Slipper.” 
“The rehearsal schedule is pretty heavy,” Schultze said, “But thankfully all my classes are late at night so I’m able to fit them in after I rehearse.” 
Schultze shared that she can do some coursework during her daily breaks but often ends up doing most of it on the weekends.
While Schultze was able to utilize the virtual learning environment to pursue her long-time interest while attending USC, other students, such as Maya Robles, forged newer paths.
Robles, a sophomore majoring in public relations and Spanish, began making jewelry in January for her startup brand Fuchsia Peach Rings. 
“The whole reason why I have the time to be making rings and stuff is totally due in part to the pandemic because I am a full-time student and have a job.” Robles said, “So it’s more of a side project.” 
Since she began Fuchsia Peach Rings, Robles has amassed nearly 1,000 followers on the brand’s Instagram account. 
“I would say that like 90% or more of my customers come from following my Instagram,” Robles said.
Robles said online classes give students the ability to multitask, yet when other students are cooking or doing other things, according to Robles, she’s making jewelry. 
“There’s been times where I’ve had my camera off in a class and I’m working on a ring because a drop is coming up,” she said. 
On the Fuchsia Peach Rings website, Robles shares the meaning behind her jewelry: “I am interested in exploring our obsession with making what was old new again, and capturing how this nostalgia displaces itself onto our belongings,” the website reads.
Robles expressed that she has yet to make much of a profit, but a large amount of the proceeds from her sales have been donated to local businesses and charities.
Gabriela Thur De Koos, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies and law, history and culture, decided to begin a podcast with her newfound flexibility. 
Titled “College Confrontational,” the podcast focuses on having a meaningful dialogue about collegiate issues and “reforming the way that we have conversations about maybe more controversial topics or topics that are just very polarizing in general,” she said.
Thur De Koos said the title of the podcast stemmed from wanting to redefine what it means to be confrontational.
“Being confrontational just means learning how to advocate for yourself and to be upfront with where you stand and honest and transparent enough to ask questions when you don’t know the answer or when you don’t understand something,” Thur De Koos said. 
The onset of the pandemic not only gave Thur De Koos more flexibility but  also helped her develop the idea for the podcast. Thur De Koos felt that online learning removed pressure from others and let her focus on what she truly wanted to do.
“I’ve never really thought that I would find myself in a position like this, and while it’s impacted me in a lot of maybe more negative ways, it’s also made me way more creative because I’ve had the time to flesh out ideas and to pursue them,” she said. 
She also pointed out that the shift to online as a result of the pandemic made it much easier to arrange virtual interviews for episodes of “College Confrontational.”
Anthony Ramirez-Garcia, a sophomore in the Iovine and Young Academy, shared similar sentiments on how the pandemic gave him more flexibility to pursue his interests. Ramirez-Garcia also started a podcast, dubbed “Meditation with Anthony.” 
Ramirez-Garcia has long had an interest in meditation and spirituality, but the freedom he gained because of the pandemic finally gave him a way to share his passion.
“I think that isolation time kind of gave me some time just to think and just to be like well, I do meditation, I really like design, I like doing some of these other things, maybe I could try it,” Ramirez-Garcia said.
The podcast focuses on providing accessible meditation at a time when people seem to be more stressed than ever. Ramirez-Garcia spoke about misconceptions regarding meditation, “There’s also a lot of stereotypes about meditation like people think you’re sitting there for hours.”
Ramirez-Garica hopes his podcast will help listeners realize that “you can add in meditation and mindfulness to anything.” 
Both Thur De Koos and Ramirez-Garcia are in the process of writing more episodes, which will be released in the near future.
Since last March, the pandemic has fueled many students’ productivity in ways that few could have predicted.
“I finally had time to really think, and I just thought I’m going to just do this and go for it,” Thur De Koos said.

With All-Star weekend done, the second half of the NBA season is back on and running at full speed. 
The road to the playoffs’ tip-off in mid-May has been far from an easy one for the Los Angeles Lakers.
As mentioned in my last column, star forward Anthony Davis will be out for at least four weeks with a calf injury. Last Friday, the Lakers announced his re-evaluation in the next two weeks. 
Prior to the injury, Davis was having an off-year by his standards — averaging 22.5 points per game along with 8.4 rebounds per game and 1.8 blocks per game. The 22.5 points per game are his lowest total since his second season in the league. 
The Lakers have been 4-10 since the Brow was forced to leave the game against the Denver Nuggets on Valentine’s Day. Granted, the Lakers were also without outstanding guard Dennis Schroder for a week due to the NBA’s coronavirus protocols.
It was in this stretch that I noticed something odd, something that really was not prevalent last season. 
Are the Lakers just going through the motions until the playoffs when they’re at full capacity? 
It’s a smart, but extremely dangerous strategy that could be disastrous when May comes around. With limited fans in attendance for some teams, home court advantage is seemingly gone, which, for years, has been the biggest weapon in the playoffs.  
As a result, the Lakers have been coasting through games. What made last year’s team so spectacular was their play-hard attitude basically every night during the regular season. 
Last season, they were also healthy for the most part. Davis missed only 10 games, which, given his injury history, was solid. LeBron James only missed four games.
The team’s two biggest stars were almost always around in the big games that counted. They established chemistry on the court during the season’s suspension and resumption in the bubble.
The Lakers’ biggest threat last season, the Los Angeles Clippers, struggled with injuries and “load management” and failed to build continuity on the court — a failure that ultimately hurt them in the playoffs.
Right now, it seems like the same thing is happening to the Lakers.
They’ve been lethargic, taking games off and struggling to put opponents out of games. The injuries have mounted on top of an offseason that lasted just over two months. They’ve been dragging through games like a college student without a spring break.
Even with all these obstacles, the Lakers are still among the top four teams in the Western Conference and in the midst of a three-game winning streak where they’ve played some of their best basketball of the season. 
The Lakers’ position in the conference and wins would be something to celebrate in some other cities, but in L.A., we only celebrate one thing: championships. Right now, the Lakers don’t seem to be playing like champions.
Yes, some nights you see the deep roster’s potential and what they can be capable of doing. Yes, it is only March. But all I’m asking for is more effort and continuity on the court. 
However, it’s fair to say that none of this matters until Davis is back, especially since injuries continue to pile up. 
Fan-favorite guard Alex Caruso has had an up-and-down year. He was recently sidelined with a head injury  after just coming back from a neck injury. For the first 38 games, Caruso has missed the same amount of games he missed during last year’s 712-game season. 
Brother of the ultimate Lakers fan-favorite Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, had been extremely durable through the season. However, recently he was added to the NBA’s coronavirus protocol list for God knows what and has missed four games as a result.
Davis, Caruso and Gasol are three enormous pieces for this team — especially Gasol, who has done an excellent job anchoring the defense while Davis has been injured.
With Gasol out, , the Lakers now have to rely on newly acquired center Damon Jones to help on the defensive end. With five new players on the squad this season, it’s imperative that the team builds championship habits before it’s too late. However, at the end of the day, any team with Davis and LeBron can do just that.

USC women’s golf travels to Athens, Ga. this weekend to play in the Liz Murphey Collegiate Classic hosted by the University of Georgia. USC previously won the tournament in 2014 and 2015. 
The No. 10 Trojans are looking to build on a strong start to their season after winning three of their four tournaments so far. Currently ranked sixth in the nation by the Women’s Golf Coaches Association poll, USC approaches the tournament after a 10-day hiatus since their third place finish at the Arizona Wildcat Invitational on Mar. 9.
Senior Alyaa Abdulghany is confident in the Trojans’ ability to continue their success. 
“Everybody has been performing really well coming back from the [coronavirus] season,” Abdulghany said. “We’ve put in a lot of work and prepared, and I’m really pleased with how the girls have played.”
This will be the first tournament the Trojans have competed in that will allow spectators to attend since the coronavirus pandemic upended the 2020 season. 
The field for this weekend is composed of 14 SEC conference teams with the additions of Louisville, College of Charleston and USC. 
“It will definitely be a good game gauger,” Abdulghany said. “This is one of our tournaments that we are moving to the East Coast, we will get to see a couple of the teams we don’t usually see when we are out playing Pac-12 so this will give us a chance to see how we play against the players on the other side.” 
Two such teams USC will face are the No. 1 South Carolina Gamecocks and No. 4 LSU Tigers. A strong showing from the Trojans this weekend will lock them into the conversation of favorites for the NCAA title.
One player to watch is senior Allisen Corpuz, who has led the Trojans to their victories with individual first place finishes at the Lamkin San Diego Invitational and the Gold Rush, as well as a third place finish at the Sun Devil Winter Classic. She currently ranks No. 11 in the World Amatuer Golf Rankings and was recently named on the latest ANNIKA Award Watch List by the Golf Channel and Golfweek. This award is presented annually to the most outstanding college women’s golfer.
Fellow seniors Amelia Garvey and Abdulghany have also had impressive starts to the season and in the team’s last tournament. Garvey finished in 10th place with 2-under 214, marking her sixth top-16 finish in a row. Abdulghany followed with a top-15 finish, after earning a top five finish in the two tournaments prior. She has not placed outside top-13 yet this season. 
According to Abdulghany, head coach Justin Silverstein has done well maintaining morale and a spirit of competitiveness within the team. 
“[Silverstein] is really adamant about fostering a very competitive environment and it seems to be working,” Abdulghany said. “Every girl on the team has been improving. We help each other out when it’s not qualifying, so I think overall that really adds to the expectations that we have for this team.” 
The first round of the Liz Murphey Collegiate Classic begins Friday at 8:30 a.m. at the UGA Golf course.

After a February hiatus from play due to positive coronavirus tests within the program and two tough defeats to No. 8 Washington Huskies, the women’s volleyball team looks to bounce back against the No. 15 UCLA Bruins. 
USC missed six matches this season due to coronavirus-related cancellations. The Trojans suffered back-to-back losses in Seattle, the first March 12 by a score of 25-23, 19-25, 24-26, 21-25 and 15-12. This has been a theme for the team all season — struggling to close out five set matches that come down to the wire. Unfortunately, USC’s second match against the Washington Huskies wasn’t as competitive, ending in a final score of 25-16, 26-24 and 25-15, respectively.
The Trojans must now prepare for two matches this weekend against their crosstown rival, the first at Galen Center on Friday and the second at Pauley Pavillion Sunday.
The Bruins have compiled an impressive 11-5 record this season but recently fell to No. 9 ranked Utah this past Sunday 1-3 after a two match weekend. However, UCLA was able to beat the Utes March 12 in a 3-1 match. This is a feat that the Trojans could not accomplish after being swept by Utah in Salt Lake City in February. 
UCLA senior outside hitter Mac May currently ranks second in the Pac-12 in points scored and kills made per set. For the Trojans, senior outside hitter Brooke Botkin continues to be the leader of the team. Botkin led USC with 19 kills in the Trojans’ first match against Washington this past Friday. Junior outside hitter Brooklyn Schirmer has emerged as a key player as well, totaling seven kills, five digs and a block in the same game. Botkin and Schirmer will continue to anchor the offense this weekend against the Bruins. 
Head coach Brad Keller emphasized the need to strengthen their serving to allow offense the chance to finish a point.
“Obviously, I think that we need to continually stress and get better at serving and passing,” Keller said. “I know that’s such a ‘Water is wet’ statement, but we do want to have and crank up service pressure. No, I don’t want to miss 42 serves in a weekend, but in order to learn and to get to that space, you have to push that boundary. I think we’re getting better at that.”
Keller, who is in his first season as head coach of the Trojans, is no stranger to the UCLA Volleyball program. Before accepting the position, Keller was the associate head coach at UCLA for the 2019 season, where he helped lead the Bruins to a 19-12 record and an appearance in the NCAA tournament. Before that, he spent six years as an assistant coach for the UCLA men’s volleyball team.
As far as the Trojan’s defense, Keller said he is confident it will come together to set up hitters.
“Passing is going to come in time,” Keller said. “We’ve changed a lot of their technique, fundamentals and all of those things. The systems that we’re running are different. I’d like to continue working on those systems and get better at them.” 
The first match will start Friday at 8 p.m. and the second match will start Sunday at 4:30 p.m. Both matches will air live on the Pac-12 Network.

While it has given the environment a chance to breathe in many ways, the sad reality of the pandemic is that we’ve had no choice but to turn to single-use plastics as a means of minimizing the spread of the coronavirus. From panic-buying plastic water bottles and surgical masks to stocking up on bottles of hand sanitizer and wipes, people’s priorities have shifted from sustainability to disposability in an effort to keep themselves healthy. 
Picking up food to-go means plastic bags and utensils, and many grocery stores have only started allowing people to bring in their own bags recently. As shoppers avoided brick-and-mortar stores, Amazon has sent out more individually-wrapped products in cardboard packaging than ever before, even hiring 100,000 extra workers during the height of the pandemic to keep up with the high demand. 
Although vaccine rollout is now progressing and restrictions are slowly lifting, there’s one part of the pandemic that isn’t going away soon, especially for college students. 
As we come full circle and reenter the month of March, most people have likely taken a coronavirus test by now. For those of us living on or near USC’s campus, tests are as ingrained into our weekly routine as picking up groceries, as we have to complete two per week just to go on campus. 
For student population testing, USC uses PCR coronavirus tests, which detect for the genetic material of the virus in a nasal swab or saliva sample. Results are returned in about 24 hours and yield more reliable info than rapid antigen tests. Last semester, the procedure was a simple nose swab, but this spring, USC Student Health and the Keck School of Medicine switched to saliva testing to expand testing capacity.  
For my USC readers who haven’t yet subjected themselves to one of these tests, let me enlighten you with a detailed but scientifically vague description. 
While the nose swab test wasn’t the most comfortable feeling, it was quick, painless and left me feeling like I was on the verge of a sneeze for a minute or two. The saliva test, which I had foolishly assumed was a cheek swab (spoiler — it is NOT!), is less straightforward, albeit arguably the most minimally invasive coronavirus procedure proven effective. 
Once students arrive at a testing site, they are given a plastic test tube, miniature funnel and plastic straw. The theory is that chewing on the straw will release saliva, which is then spit through the funnel into the tube. 
The reality is several minutes of sitting in distantly-spaced rows of chairs, covertly trying to fill your tube with spit without making excessively awkward eye contact with those spitting around you and then presenting your saliva-filled tube for examination. 
Sometimes, a student health employee will inform you that your spit is too bubbly or the tube is not quite full enough, and you are sent back to your seat of shame armed with a new plastic funnel and straw to fill your tube with a higher quality saliva. 
Especially with the new option of dropping off a completed saliva test, USC is relying on students to follow the procedure of no eating or drinking 30 minutes prior to taking the test, as well as assuming that students who are dropping off samples are turning in testable saliva. 
I hate to leave a negative review, but the functionality of this new testing system is not only more wasteful but less effective than the previous. 
The disorganization and high testing population accountability not only leads to the generation of more waste but also more inconclusive tests. I get regularly tested twice a week for the sole purpose of hammocking on campus, and I’ve received inconclusive results via the saliva test multiple times, whereas last semester, I never received anything but an accurate test result.
If USC is anticipating any semblance of a full return to campus in the fall, it’s more than likely that student population testing will be mandatory to track outbreaks. While I would hazard a guess that the new system is cheaper (saliva testing requires fewer enzymes and chemicals needed to process samples) and removes the need for outsourcing to other testing companies, Keck and Student Health need to consider how best to streamline testing services for the coming summer and fall months to cut costs, time and waste. 
To those of you who have stuck with me through my Yelp-like review of USC’s current testing setup, take my words with a grain of salt. While its current mode of PCR testing needs significant work, USC has taken coronavirus seriously, with its strange PR campaign (i.e. the banners hanging from the light posts on campus) to its ramped-up testing efforts. 
Requiring students to visit campus to get tested twice a week takes time, money and resources. Still, the Engemann Student Health Center makes the process as easy and inexcusable as possible for students living in the University Parkarea.
I’ve become accustomed to seeing those blue disposable masks mixed in with the litter on the street in Los Angeles, and every time I sit down to take another test, I wince at the amount of plastic going into the trash. 
While, unfortunately, and understandably, waste generation must take a backseat to public health during a global pandemic, it’s still something worth considering when we have the luxury to do so. 
As more of the public receive vaccinations and the world regains some semblance of normalcy, perhaps now is the time for scientists, doctors and institutions like USC to consider how to streamline still-mandatory coronavirus testing procedures, minimizing waste when they can while still getting accurate and reliable results. 
Many environmentalists argue that the coronavirus is single-handedly reversing the global momentum we’ve created in cutting down on single-use plastics. 
The plastic bag ban in California grocery stores was temporarily lifted, and I’ll admit that I’ve contributed more than my usual share of takeout containers and empty iced coffee cups in the past year. During the best of times, the economic feasibility of recycling was nowhere near where it should have been. Even now, with an onslaught of single-use plastics weighing down on recycling facilities, recycling programs have been suspended, and many items are not being accepted as collection points try to protect their workers and freelance recyclers from potential virus exposure. 
In addition to the increase in single-use waste, any and all waste from hospitals, testing and vaccination sites is considered a contaminated biohazard and sent straight to a hazardous waste facility to be incinerated.
There isn’t a feasible alternative to this scenario right now, and I would be foolish to suggest otherwise. The irony is that our hyper hygiene has only created more waste in the environment to clean up later. However, the current situation should be an opportunity for reflection. It all comes back to a topic that I, personally, love to hate: capitalism. The value of recyclable materials and plastics needs to be higher — otherwise, there is simply no incentive to put in the effort of recycling single-use materials. 
This turning point in our society should be a prime opportunity to invest in more effective waste disposal and recycling mechanisms — studies suggest that worldwide, only about 10% of the plastic ever produced has been recycled.  
Ultimately, the solution lies beyond single-use and disposable products, as we need to be looking toward a future of biodegradable, compostable, renewable and sustainable production materials. Consumption patterns of 2020 and 2021 is a behavior shift that needs to be temporary; once we’ve moved past this period, we need to make up for lost ground and lost time, and reduce the grasp that plastics and petrochemicals have on our lives and the environment.
