Based on a painfully dated police procedural remembered for launching Johnny Depp’s acting career and not much else, the first 21 Jump Street movie should have been a spectacular misfire, another cautionary tale about the dangers of exhuming a once-popular television series and hastily retooling it to attract modern audiences. Instead co-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller delivered an inspired shot of lunacy that kick-started the pair’s reputation for salvaging projects other filmmakers would dismiss as long shots or lost causes, a reputation that was cemented in box office gold earlier this year with the spectacular success of The Lego Movie, which turned what could have been a soulless corporate cash-grab into a joyous, self-aware ode to playtime.

Thanks in large part to the almost vaudevillian chemistry between Jonah Hill and the unexpectedly hilarious Channing Tatum as Schmidt and Jenko, two undercover detectives frantically attempting to pass as jaded, ultra-hip high school students, 21 Jump Street was one of the biggest hits of spring 2012, ultimately grossing more than $200 million worldwide on a relatively conservative budget of $42 million. Given the critical and commercial reception of the film, a follow-up was inevitable. But can lightning be bottled twice?
Sequels, with their penchant for needlessly inflated budgets and paint-by-numbers plot repetition, are always a tricky business, but comedy sequels in particular tend to fare the worst in terms of being enjoyable, or even marginally tolerable. Will 22 Jump Street, scheduled for release this Friday, become one of the few to justify its own existence, or will it follow the path of mediocrity laid out by such forgettable flops as Caddyshack II, Blues Brothers 2000 and Airplane II: The Sequel?
So why is it so difficult to make a decent comedy sequel? For one thing, comedians are like sharks: they can’t stop moving forward or they’ll suffocate, and any attempt to play off old jokes and gags is bound to feel hackneyed in comparison to what’s come before. The Central Park brawl in last year’s Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues was packed to the rafters with clever imagery, instantly quotable dialogue and enough shameless celebrity cameos to make Jimmy Kimmel blush, but no amount of minotaur decapitations and soul-sucking Confederate generals could recapture the absurdist charm of the original Anchorman’s news team rumble.
Good comedy revels in the heady rush that comes from the discovery and exaltation of the new. After that all-important element of surprise is lost, it’s disturbingly easy to slide into stagnation. Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, arguably the funniest comedic duo of all time, were famously hesitant to add new routines to their repertoire, choosing instead to lean on well-worn classics such as “Who’s On First?” and this reluctance, coupled with the pair’s general overexposure and the rapid ascendance of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, hastened their decline in the early 1950s.
Nostalgia literally means “the pain from an old wound,” and comedies that rely on it too much run the risk of making their audiences suffer as well. With the exception of Michael Caine’s amorous, Dutch-hating gentleman spy, Austin Powers in Goldmember was just an extended reminder of how funny Mike Myers used to be, rehashing old running gags from International Man of Mystery and The Spy Who Shagged Me instead of inventing new ones.
In some cases, this misguided sense of nostalgia is transplanted from a completely unrelated movie. Be Cool, the belated but mostly bearable sequel to the showbiz send-up Get Shorty, caused quite a stir by promising to reunite John Travolta and Uma Thurman on the dance floor for the first time since the immortal twist contest scene in Pulp Fiction. The new dance, however, ended up being little more than a tepid, overproduced afterthought — the Black Eyed Peas are a piss-poor substitute for Chuck Berry — that contained none of the reckless abandon or sex-and-death ecstasy of the couple’s first onscreen encounter.
There’s a fine line between paying homage to previous films in a series and ripping them off wholesale. Some films — Todd Phillips’ The Hangover Part II and Jay Roach’s pointless threequel Little Fockers are particularly egregious examples — copy their predecessors beat-for-beat in ways so lazy and condescending that they could easily qualify as acts of self-plagiarism, offering up grotesque facsimiles of the original films where all the laughs have been replaced with cynical winks and sneers.
Not all comedy sequels have to be terrible. In fact, a chosen few — the second and third Toy Story films, National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation — are rightfully regarded as genuine classics. They all have one thing in common: a willingness to push boundaries and expand their visions, even to the point of conceptual insanity. Back to the Future Part II, for example, embraced the first film’s time travel conceit with madcap zeal, resulting in a movie that darted in and out of the original’s timeline while taking the story and the characters — specifically the villainous Biff, who went from schoolyard bully to dystopian overlord thanks to an all-powerful sports almanac -— in bold new directions. The underrated Gremlins 2: The New Batch, meanwhile, took the first film’s monster movieformula and ran it through a paper shredder, evolving into what can only be described as an acid-soaked Chuck Jones cartoon, complete with an appearance from horror legend Christopher Lee as a resourceful mad scientist.
22 Jump Street, which finds Hill and Tatum posing as college freshmen in order to infiltrate a campus drug ring, appears to have a healthy amount of post-modern awareness about the low expectations associated with comedy sequels. Even its deliberately unimaginative title speaks to Lord and Miller’s amusement with the idea of unnecessary, studio-mandated follow-ups. The trailers, especially the profanity-laden red-band versions, are rife with jokes about formulaic storytelling, starting with the perpetually furious Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) and his oft-repeated catchphrase, “Do the same thing and everyone’s happy!” It’s that kind of insolent meta-commentary that makes Lord and Miller two of the most exciting, discreetly subversive filmmakers to hit the mainstream in quite some time. And just like the Jump Street boys, they’re used to working undercover.

The Electronic Entertainment Expo started this week off with a bang as every gamer waited anxiously for the next generation of games from the video game industry’s foremost developers and publishers. From Microsoft to Sony, each company had big name titles and gameplay to showcase. Whether these games were still in development or newly announced, playable demos and videos were released to international scrutiny.
Unified at last · Xbox E3 briefing included a live demonstration of the next installment in Ubisoft’s Assasin’s Creed franchise, Unity. The next-generation game experience will feature collaborative multiplayer gameplay. – Photo Courtesy of Xbox Wire
 
This year’s E3 gave gamers around the world a sneak peek at the next generation of gaming, which mainly emphasized integrated, worldwide and real-time multiplayer capabilities. With bated breath, drumming fingers and sweaty palms, gamers and developers around the world patiently waited for the biggest question to be answered: what’s next?
Traditionally, companies such as Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft hold a press briefing the day before the opening of E3’s show floor. Similarly to last year, Nintendo stepped down from holding a live press conference alongside its fellow competitors. Instead, ihe company chose to show a pre-rendered video on the opening day of E3.
After the company’s abysmal sales of the Nintendo WiiU, it is unclear if Nintendo will host a live press conference at the convention in future years. Meanwhile, the other companies broadcasted live demonstrations of real-time game play along with well-prepared video trailers.
Near the end of May, game titles and release date leaks rattled the online community. Leaked information spoiled the pre-E3 energy as the audience swelled with worry rather than excitement. While the speakers introduced the upcoming lineup of games, audience members eagerly anticipated a surprise announcement or breaking news. Even a small technical mistake would have aroused more interest in E3’s drawn-out television advertisements and seemingly never-ending hype.
The live demonstrations certainly lived up to the hype, giving viewers a chance to jump into the world of Assassin’s Creed: Unity, Far Cry 4 and Battlefield: Hardline. During EA, Ubisoft, Microsoft and Sony’s press conferences, they demonstrated that the future of gaming is not in grotesque graphics or new shiny weaponry, but in unity. The recent pattern of online co-op games and live-streaming gave rise to the immense popularity of multiplayer games.
Both Microsoft and Ubisoft’s demonstrations of Assassin’s Creed: Unity multiplayer capabilities retained the original concept of the first game. However, the inclusion of four new multi-colored, caped and stubbled male characters left much to be desired. Other than Captain Xavier’s impressive aerial assassination, the gameplay remained stale and repetitive. Using the same tactics as its predecessors, Arno Dorian stealthily moves around Paris on the eve of the French Revolution, and does what he does best: killing enemies from behind. In Unity, Dorian gains three new companions on his journey to expose the true corruption behind the Revolution.
Another notable title was Battlefield: Hardline’s beta demo at EA’s press briefing. Hardline opens in a fictional rendition of downtown Los Angeles as a bank heist that places two teams against each other. A game of eight players engage in a strategic reinvention of a cross between “Capture the Flag” and “Cops and Robbers,” in which four players play the thieves who try to drop off their “loot,” while the other four play as the police who try to stop the thieves from escaping. As a first-person shooter, the game looks impressive with its interesting escape tactics, some of which involve grappling hooks and falling construction cranes. But the gameplay itself seemed too similar to other FPS games such as Tom Clancy’s The Division, in which the player can only hide behind cars for protection and shoot a limited number of bullets to take out the enemy.
Despite the potential for both philosophical and social breakthroughs in the gaming community, this year was not the year of women. Female-led games such as Rise of the Tomb Raider and Mirror’s Edge 2 lost steam in light of the domination of seemingly identical first-person shooters.
One aspect of all the press conferences was surprising: most publishers refused to take risks. This year’s E3 gave gamers around the world a sneak place of the next generation of gaming, which places much more emphasis on expanding the multiplayer capabilities within existing game franchises. Since the Xbox One and Playstation 4 were released last year, E3 2014 opened the door for publishers and developers to showcase software with more impressive graphics and bigger content, and also expanded the possibilities of next-generation gaming.
Instead of including new and unannounced material, all of the big companies decided to play it safe by broadcasting pre-rendered videos of software in development as opposed to offering playable demos, as well as showing off titles that already had leaked dates.
In addition to “playing it safe,” publishers were reluctant to release playable demos for some highly anticipated franchises. High-profile games such as Mirror’s Edge 2, Mass Effect 4 and Dragon Age Inquisition had little to show after one long year of hard work. Though fans might have expected actual playable demonstrations of these games, they were left with game developer diaries and “inside looks.”
However, gamers at home no longer have to feel left out from the tightly closed-off trade show. Since the show is only available to a closed number of qualified computer and gaming audiences, E3 gave fans around the world the ability to beta test from their own homes immediately after the press conferences. Even though there were plenty of missteps this year, publishers showcasing at E3 demonstrated their understanding of the rapidly expanding international community of gamers by making its games readily available to the gaming community.

As of Tuesday, the NCAA sanctions on USC’s athletic programs have expired. After four years of being hamstrung by a two-year postseason ban, scholarship limitations and the vacating of a Heisman Trophy, as well as the 2004 BCS National Championship and all of their victories in 2005, the USC football team is now free from its NCAA-imposed bureaucratic imprisonment.
Opinions on the NCAA’s sanctions on USC range from the uninformed (such as our cross-town rival’s mantra, “they cheated”) to the more outspoken (ESPN.com’s Ted Miller called it “the most egregious miscarriage of justice in the history of NCAA enforcement”). History has judged, and will continue to judge, the Trojans more favorably in the aftermath of the sanctions. This will be due in part to the severity of the sanctions in comparison to the lighter treatment of concurrent non-complying schools, and the fact that more evidence of the NCAA’s maliciously punitive intent in its handling of the case will come to light when the defamation suit filed against the organization by former USC running backs coach Todd McNair is settled once and for all.
The Los Angeles Times published a series of articles earlier this week dealing with the issue of sanctions, and covered the gamut of USC sanction topics. The major headline was former USC head coach and current Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll stating in an interview with the L.A. Times that had he known about the severity of the sanctions, he would have stayed to help USC through them.
The timing of Carroll’s departure is well-documented, and it’s doubtful any person in Carroll’s position would have given up $35 million and the full range of personnel decisions that Carroll was offered up north to return to a school facing a two-year postseason ban and a massive reduction in scholarships. The fact is that Carroll, who is still revered by the vast majority of the USC community (including myself), didn’t stay for the sanctions.
Lane Kiffin, however, did. Kiffin was escaping some Southern heat when he was making his return to his old stomping grounds, but that doesn’t change the fact that it was Kiffin who got USC through the roughest patch of sanctions. The argument against remembering Kiffin’s legacy in his time at USC is simple: The coach failed to lead a team with monumental expectations and a preseason No. 1 ranking to the national title, much less a bowl game. And then in the next season, Kiffin’s team suffered gut-wrenching losses to Pac-12 doormat Washington State and gave up 62 points to Arizona State.
What many of the Trojan faithful fail to recall, however, is that Kiffin righted the ship in the face of extreme adversity and uncertainty in his second year with the team in 2011. Fans were not permitted to wallow in the misery of a postseason ban, a thinned-out roster or scholarship reductions. There were no “Free ’SC” t-shirts that rued the NCAA sanctions. There were, however, “USC 50, UCLA 0” t-shirts. The Trojans did as Trojans do: They didn’t feel sorry for themselves, they just went right on pretending the sanctions didn’t exist and threw their own postseason party.
When former USC quarterback Matt Barkley announced he would return for his senior season (a move that would eventually prove fatal to his draft stock), expectations ran high and the nation was bullish on a Pac-12-SEC showdown between the Trojans and Alabama. But here’s where things got murky — there was no way that USC would be able to repeat its dominance after losing an eventual NFL Pro Bowl-caliber offensive lineman in Matt Kalil and elite defensive end Nick Perry in the 2012 NFL Draft. The defensive schemes and offensive line were constantly maligned throughout the Trojans’ ill-fated 2012 campaign, and Darth Visor shouldered much of the blame. The only comparison that comes close to mirroring Kiffin’s situation at USC was Bill O’Brien’s tenure with Penn State. O’Brien took a heavily sanctioned Penn State team in the wake of scandal to records of 8-4 and 7-5. O’Brien was not unceremoniously fired in the parking lot of an airport — he ended up taking up a job as head coach of the Houston Texans in 2013.
Kiffin’s unique brand of gamesmanship didn’t do anything to help the perception of USC as being a program focused on gaining all possible advantages. But Kiffin weathered a scholarship reduction to haul in a top-20 recruiting class in both 2011 and 2012 despite being at a significant disadvantage. He managed to coach his players at a high level in the face of aggressive NCAA compliance efforts and restrictions.
The coach’s farsighted stratagems, however, were eventually his own undoing: by performing so brilliantly under sanctions, Kiffin raised expectations of a thinned-out roster to perilous, even unreasonable levels. When he was fired in the middle of the 2013 season following the aforementioned humiliating losses to Washington State and ASU, few were sad to see him go.
Looking back on the course of the sanctions, more people will remember Lane Kiffin as the coach who continued to run more bubble screens and running plays when the Washington State defense was loading up the edges. Few will realize that these play calls were focused on shortening the overall game clock to preserve an offensive line and defense that was growing thin not only due to scholarship reductions, but also due to injury. Success in college football coaching, like most things in life, is dictated not by one’s past successes, but by the mantra of “what have you done for me lately?” Here’s what Lane Kiffin did: he was the coach who led the Trojans during one of the most trying times in the program’s history. He left a cupboard full of five-star recruits and managed to lift the spirits of a school in NCAA-imposed turmoil.
If USC remembers anything about the NCAA sanctions, it should be that Lane Kiffin wasn’t the coach USC wanted at the time, but that he was the coach who was there when the Trojans needed one most.

I did not like him as the OC, much less the HC. On the other hand, he took a tough job and he knew it was coming.  He was not afraid of a challenge. I will always defend him as one of the great recruiters ever (and we all know there are some pretty awesome recruiters) especially in light of what he was selling; a great tradition but lots of baggage.
You forgot to mention how overbearing he was to everyone under him, once he saw some success and figured he was untouchable and became that douche that the entire nation still sees.  From everyone I’ve spoken to, many people in HH said he wasn’t easy to deal with and Kennedy Polumalu(who is a real Trojan) would probably agree.  Many players were relieved he left since he played favorites, and where would Buck Allen be if he were still around?
Kiffin was a distraction and an abomination. He let himself and his father nearly ruin a great team chocked full of blue-chip 4& 5 star talent that was either already on the squad or born dreaming about becoming a Trojan. Monte Kiffin should have been fired after year two, but his son made up excuses to keep him on and that led Sr. Kiffin staying on to lead the 3 worst defensive teams under his system in the history of USC football. 
Lane mismanaged and was horrible with the media, the coaching staff, and the team! He under-recruited athletes even with the team having limited scholarships the last two seasons – he didn’t use up the already limited allotment! The last year he only signed 12 players!  He was a sanction on to himself. Star players in Woods and Lee couldn’t stand him. When he was fired there wasn’t a tear shed on that team. They immediately started winning again. He held on to a playcard the entire game like a Denny’s menu in the hands of a schizophrenic homeless man. He was a terrible game coach, and NEVER won a game from behind after the first half. If USC wasn’t leading by half-time – GAME OVER.
He actually hired two offensive line coaches (unheard of) and fired the only defensive backs coach. So the defensive secondary played without a position coach the entire 2012-2013 season!! And people wonder why the team lost to Washington St. and Arizona St! What a freaking idiot that guy was.
Good riddance!!
He deserves no respect. He took a proud program, who stood tall through some really crappy times, and turned it into a mockery. I could care less about the record, the closed practices, fights with reporters, recruiting games and the overall lack of respect for our hallowed program makes me wish he were at Alabama. Oh wait….
Let’s not get all romantic about Kiffen.  He was a hell of a recruiter, but a horrible game manager and played not to lose.  Also the theatrics will not be missed.
I respect the message of this article. A sanction-ridden USC football program wasn’t exactly a dream job for any coach. Kiff stuck with us, and despite the odds, we never endured a .500 or sub-.500 season. I think the sting of the sanctions was made less severe by Kiffin’s off-field expertise: recruiting. No matter what, depth and health were going to be an issue for USC during this period. He made this problem manageable with big time recruits like Leonard Williams, Nelson Agholor, Marqise Lee, Su’a Cravens, and others.
Kiffin was USC’s biggest sanction during the sanctions.
Haha ouch. I respect this article and fact that Kiffin took on a program that not many wished to. I’ll forever remember the 2011 season, specifically the 50-0 romping of UCLA and the win in Eugene. Kiff just put too much on his shoulders and he and USC paid dearly for it. He’s a great offensive mind, but not a great leader of men at this point. I think his job at Alabama will bring him back. I wish him the best.

USC’s track & field program is riding high heading into the 2014 NCAA Track & Field Championships in Eugene, Oregon this week.
Racing toward the finish · The No. 13 ranked USC track and field team will send senior Aaron Brown to compete in the 100-meter dash. – Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
Both the men’s and women’s programs are ranked No. 13 in the nation and are coming off of an impressive showing at the West Preliminary Rounds, which earned two members of the Trojan squad regional awards.
First-year head coach Caryl Smith Gilbert earned the West Region Women’s Head Coach of the Year Award from the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association.
Smith Gilbert, who succeeded 19-year head coach Ron Allice, led the Women of Troy to second place at the 2014 Pac-12 Track & Field Championships last month. Individually, the Women of Troy won a conference-best seven events, two more than national powerhouse Oregon.
Senior hurdler Aleec Harris was named the West Region Men’s Track Athlete of the Year. The Atlanta native set the Pac-12 and national record time in the men’s 110-meter hurdles. His time of 13.18 (+1.8) broke the previous Pac-12 record, set in 1978 by UCLA’s Greg Foster, by 0.04 seconds.
Harris’ time currently ranks second in the world and is the second-fastest 110 meter high hurdles time ever by an NCAA athlete, behind Maryland’s Renaldo Nehemiah, who ran a 13.00 in 1979.
Prior to his record-setting performance at the NCAA Track & Field West Preliminary Rounds, Harris won the 2014 Pac-12 110-meter hurdle championship with a time of 13.35 and won the Mt. SAC Relays with a time of 13.32.
Harris will be the only Trojan competing in the men’s 110-meter hurdle event at the NCAA Championships. He will be going up against Texas A&M’s Wayne Davis II, the reigning men’s champion.
Harris will join senior Aaron Brown and juniors Davonte Stewart and BeeJay Lee to represent USC in the men’s 4×100 relay.
Brown, who hails from Toronto, will also partake in the men’s 100-meter dash. His preliminary time of 10.12 ranks sixth in the nation this season and was good enough for first place in the Pac-12 this season. In addition, Brown will partake in the 200-meter event, where his 20.16 at the NCAA prelims ranks fourth in the nation this season.
Lee will also compete in the 100-meter dash after posting a 10.16w at the NCAA West Preliminary Rounds.
Senior Viktor Fajoyomi will compete in the men’s decathlon following a second-place showing at the conference tournament.
USC’s men’s team currently holds 26 NCAA Outdoor Track & Field titles, and will look to improve upon that this weekend.
On the women’s side, 12 athletes will represent USC.
Senior Jessica Davis will look to improve upon her 11.23w time in the women’s 100 meters, which is good for 12th in the nation this season and slotted her second at the Pac-12 championships last month. Junior Tynia Gaither will also compete in this event.
Gaither’s main event, though, will be the women’s 200-meter dash, in which her time of 22.80w at Mt. SAC was good enough for sixth in the nation this season.
Davis and Gaither will team up with sophomore Alexis Faulknor and senior Loudia Laarman in the women’s 4×100 relay.
In the women’s 4×400 relay, Davis and Gaither will team up with juniors Akawkaw Ndipagbor and Vanessa Jones. This foursome has the fifth-fastest time in the nation this season, running a 3:29.42 at the Florida Relays in April.
Jones will also compete in the women’s 400-meter, while junior Melia Cox will compete in the 110-meter hurdle and freshman Amalie Iuel will compete in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles.
Senior Oluwakemi “Kemi” Olonade will partake in the women’s triple jump and junior Alexandra Collatz will represent the Women of Troy in the discus competition, in which she placed fifth last year.

Following a bittersweet season that ended just short of a postseason berth, the USC baseball team received some validation last week in the form a successful showing at the 2014 MLB Draft. Four current Trojans, along with two 2015 recruits, were selected, doubling the team’s total from a year ago.

As he did on the mound for much of this season, junior right-handed pitcher Wyatt Strahan led the way for USC. The Trojans’ Friday night ace was a third-round selection of the Cincinnati Reds, and at 93rd overall became the program’s highest draft pick since 2009. Another junior RHP, Nigel Nootbaar, was USC’s next selection, going in the 12th round to the Baltimore Orioles. An excellent season for senior third baseman Kevin Swick was capped with a 22nd-round selection by the Chicago White Sox, while senior left-hander Bob Wheatley was picked up by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 26th round.
Given his rock-solid performance over the past three seasons, Strahan’s high selection came as no great surprise. As a freshman in 2012, the Villa Park, California native allowed only four earned runs in 22 appearances out of the bullpen. He finished the season with a 3-3 record and a miniscule 1.37 ERA in 26.1 innings. Strahan entered the starting rotation in 2013, making a statement in the tough Pac-12 with a 4-3 record in 12 starts. He also led the team with a 2.45 ERA in 80.2 innings pitched. Though Strahan was faced with high expectations going into his junior season, the hard-throwing righty mirrored his team and actually improved in many categories. In 15 starts Strahan managed career-highs in innings pitched (104.1), strikeouts (89), while posting a 6-5 record with a 3.28 ERA. His work garnered him Pac-12 Pitcher of the Week honors after a complete game shutout victory over Arizona and his first First Team All-Conference selection. Strahan, who has long impressed scouts with his 6-foot-3, 225-pound frame and mid-90s fastball, was a 27th-round pick of the Arizona Diamondbacks out of high school in 2011. Now he will have to choose between USC and the pros for the second time.
Nootbaar has been a strong presence out of the Trojan bullpen for the past three years. He made 14 appearances as a freshman in 2012, including four spot starts, and finished with a 1-3 record and a 3.31 ERA. In 2013 Nootbaar became USC’s go-to reliever, recording 38 strikeouts in 47.2 innings pitched. He was 2-6 with a 5.10 ERA in 20 appearances, including four more starts on the season, while also picking up three saves. The El Segundo, California native’s opportunities declined in 2014 with the emergence of sophomore standouts Brent Wheatley and Kyle Davis, but Nootbaar remained as effective as ever. In nine appearances he managed his lowest career ERA, 2.81, and struck out 14 batters in 16 innings pitched. Even with this decreased output, Nootbaar’s tools were impressive enough for a relatively high draft selection. He was also helped by impressive performances in both the Cape Cod and Alaskan Collegiate summer leagues.
Swick is perhaps the best story of any of the Trojans’ draftees. The former walk-on cracked the starting lineup only nine times as a freshman in 2011, but quickly turned his career around after a stint in the California Collegiate Summer League. He became a regular starter in 2012, hitting .258 with 23 RBIs. Swick made an even more dramatic improvement as a junior, bumping his batting average up to .305 while blasting two home runs and driving in 16 runs as USC’s regular third baseman. This season the senior provided experience and offensive consistency for a youthful Trojan squad, batting .299 with a career-high 24 RBIs. Swick’s impressive start to the season also earned him his first career Pac-12 Player of the Week award in early March. The La Canada, California native’s consistency with the bat was matched only by his consistency in the classroom, where he was a three-time Pac-12 All-Academic Honoree and USC’s first Capital One Academic First Team All-American. Swick, who was a business administration major and psychology minor, graduated this spring with a 3.83 GPA.
Rounding out USC’s 2014 draft picks was Wheatley, a senior southpaw who regularly took the mound on Saturdays and Sundays this year. Another Villa Park native, Wheatley spent his first two seasons as a valuable part of the Trojan bullpen. In 2011 he spent time learning the ropes of Division I baseball, recording a 6.39 ERA in 18 appearances.
Wheatley improved greatly as a sophomore, deflating his ERA to 3.46 and holding opponents to a .242 batting average in 26.2 innings pitched. Even after taking over the big stage as a Friday night starter in 2013, he continued his upward trajectory. Wheatley was 3-4 in 13 starts, but finished the season with a career-best 2.78 ERA and 38 strikeouts in 77.2 innings.
This season, Wheatley conceded his Friday-night spot to Strahan, but still provided valuable starting pitching depth for the Trojans. In 12 starts, Wheatley was once again 3-4, finishing his senior year with a 4.32 ERA and 34 strikeouts. Moving on to a resurgent Blue Jays franchise might be tough for Wheatley, as USC blood runs deep in his family. Bob was joined by his younger brother Brent on the Trojan pitching staff this year, while the pair’s father, Bob Sr., played basketball at USC.
The MLB draft is a tense time for college baseball coaches, and not just because of the potential loss of talented underclassmen such as Strahan. In order to evaluate their options and decide if forgoing college is the right choice for them, many high school recruits wait to sign letters of intent until after the draft. At a top-flight program such as USC, elite high school commits often choose to instead sign with a pro team, leaving coaches scrambling.
The Trojans have already been struck by this curse once this season, as Jake Gatewood, a shortstop from Clovis, California who issued a verbal commitment to USC, instead signed with the Milwaukee Brewers as the 41st overall pick. On the other hand, the Trojans actually benefitted from the struggles of another commit, pitcher Mitch Hart of Granite Bay, California. Hart failed to live up to expectations during his senior season, causing his draft stock to plummet from the third or fourth round to the 35th round. Now, conventional wisdom and a smaller signing bonus dictate that he will choose the college route. If Hart’s subpar senior year was a fluke, USC could have another ace waiting in the wings to replace those who leave to chase their MLB dreams.

Abercrombie & Fitch, the apparel retailer people instantly associated with shirtless and muscular young male models, strong and somewhat nauseous fragrance, dark rooms and nightclub music, is trying to re-image itself after losing its target teen market. When Mike Jeffries took over Abercrombie in 1992, he came up with a business model based on a “sex meets the Ivy League” concept. They started to recruit teens and college students with the “all-American” image to model and work at their stores, created a “young and cool” atmosphere with loud club music and strong perfume/cologne, and perhaps most importantly, they made their clothing elite by selling them at very high prices and in styles that only “fit and sexy” customers can wear. This strategy worked well for a while, but became highly condemned and resented by many American teens. The dislike has been escalated after many disputes over Abercrombie’s “look policy” for employees and CEO Mike Jeffries’ ridiculously arrogant and degrading comments that the “not-so-cool kids” cannot belong in the company’s clothes and that clothing companies that try to include old and fat customers “become totally vanilla.”

Last December, Abercrombie investor and hedge fund Engaged Capital founder Glenn Welling angrily urged Abercrombie & Fitch to replace Jeffries as their CEO due to negative publicity imposed by Jeffries. Eventually, the company decided to separate the CEO and chairman positions, ultimately hiring Arthur Martinez as chairman while maintaining Jeffries as CEO. Abercrombie’s sales and stock prices continued to drop, and the company has been struggling with coming up with plausible strategies to win back their target market.
Finally, in May, Jeffries revealed A&F’s plan to let go of some of its policies and make changes to approach teens today. They decided to change up the atmosphere in stores by taking down blinds on the windows to brighten up the stores and turning the nightclub music down. Also, they took down photos of abs that used to be hung on the walls. The biggest change of all could be that they came up with a “classic fit” t-shirt for men that are looser than the standard muscle t-shirt at Abercrombie, and they added larger sizes to their products.
Abercrombie has also recently changed its brand description. While the old description prided Abercrombie as “the essence of privilege and casual luxury” that was “rooted in East Coast traditions and Ivy League heritage,” the new description calls the company “the next generation of effortless All-American style” associated with “classic campus experiences “ and “moments while traveling.” Also, where it used to be described as “preppy,” “sexy” and “popular,” the new description replaced those words with “laidback,” “creative” and “fun.” The company seems to strive for an image that fits better with today’s more progressive young generation.
This adjustment of A&F’s corporate image then made me wonder: have sex- and privilege-driven business models become too old school, or do teens and college students now look for clothing lines that foster individualism? The answer is probably both. As many could have easily noticed, American teens today prefer more affordable and diverse fashion retailers such as Forever 21, H&M and ZARA, as well as street style-orientated, edgier retailers such as Urban Outfitters and Free People. The major difference between these retailers and A&F is that the former diversifies its products so that everyone can find something that fits his or her personal style. They also constantly come up with new collections that reflect on the newest fashion trends. Besides, these stores have bigger pricing ranges that are more affordable for most customers.
Moreover, in today’s society where economic exclusiveness and discrimination are highly frowned upon and diversity is encouraged, the concept of “cool” has changed drastically. Young people look more for creativity and individuality rather than conformity, and discriminative comments such as those made by Jeffries are not at all tolerable. The American teen fashion industry definitely demonstrates a more open-minded and inclusive young generation. Though Abercrombie is making radical changes to catch up with their target market, they may still not succeed in winning their customers back for a while.

In the discussion regarding mass shootings in America that has become so unfortunately relevant, blame has been placed all across the board. There is without a doubt a problem that has gotten worse as of late; just in the last month, shootings in Isla Vista, Portland, Seattle and Las Vegas have left Americans justifiably looking for a cause. Relaxed gun laws, violent video games and the proliferation of social media have all come into the spotlight. In a recent op ed, Washington Post film critic Ann Hornaday even tried to connect the popularity of Judd Apatow movies to the Isla Vista shooting, blaming “escapist fantasies” of “mass entertainment … overwhelmingly controlled by white men.”
Looking to these factors, whether or not they are correlated to the issue, distracts from the root of the problem: mental illness and its mishandled treatment. As long as we are looking for a source of violence that is anything other than the aggressors themselves, these tragedies will continue. Americans need to view these killers for what they are — confused, lonely and aggressive people suffering from mental health issues that have gone unaddressed — rather than the products of whatever social evil is trendy for the news to sully that week.
For every gun owner who uses their gun to harm, there are thousands of others who own them responsibly. For every mass shooter who has played a violent video game, there are thousands of gamers who would never even consider such an act. For every killer who uses social estrangement as an excuse to open fire, there are thousands of self-perceived “outcasts” who would never think to harm another human.
These external scapegoats for mass shootings are simply a convenient way for media outlets to capitalize on and profit from these tragic events — it allows them to publish more and more articles about mass shootings, tying them to unrelated “evils.” They also allow individuals to make sense of the shootings, allowing them to ignore the possibility of random acts of violence and place blame on something tangible and separate from them.
Sure, increased gun control and background checks could make it more difficult for someone planning a shooting to follow through on their plan. But as long as guns exist in America, people will be able to get a
hold of them somehow. Besides, there are plenty of countries that have created effective and safe gun cultures: Switzerland, for example, ranks extremely high for gun ownership but has a much lower homicide rate than most countries.
To truly turn this trend of mass shootings in America, we should be focusing on providing adequate care to those suffering from mental illness, and recognizing the signs that someone might be in danger of harming themselves and others. Granted, much is unknown about mental health issues, and these “signs” might not be so easily spotted. But by improving access to care, reducing the stigmas associated with mental illness and educating the public on mental health issues, America would be striking at the heart of the issue. Instead, so far we have been largely ignoring it, choosing to blame unsubstantiated influences on the shooters.
In fact, focusing on potentially unrelated “causes” is insulting and unfair to those affected by mass shootings, warping tragedies into media frenzies and shifting focus away from providing help to those who need it. Tuesday’s Portland shooting should not be regarded as “proof” to back a political agenda against guns or media. It was a terrible event for the families and friends of victims and the gunman alike, and our focus should be on helping them.
Looking forward, we should be attempting to create a culture of professional and responsible care for mentally ill individuals. Elliot Rodger, for example, had been treated for mental health issues from the time he was eight years old, but was able to legally buy and store three handguns. Given his determination to carry out his plan, it is likely he would have found a way even without them — his history of mental illness, however, should have been taken into consideration. In this case, it was not the guns that were the root of the problem, but Rodger himself.
Until we as a society extend sympathy and understanding toward individuals facing these kinds of issues, we will continue facing the same problems — an unacceptable possibility given their increasing frequency in the past year. I’m not an expert who can make scientific suggestions to improve mental health care, and the institution as a whole has a way to go in America. Blaming external factors, however, dangerously ignores the cause of a terrible pattern of events that are becoming all too frequent.

Out of 1,500 applicants from around the world, 12 students have become finalists for the Infiniti Motors Performance Engineering Academy. Four of them are from the United States, and one is a fellow Trojan.

The USC finalist is Jason Zide, a rising senior majoring in mechanical engineering who will be going to the Red Bull Formula One Racing Factory in the United Kingdom in the beginning of July. There, he will take part in an intensive interview process that will last three days.
He will compete against the 11 other finalists for the final prize of a 12-month engineering role with Infiniti Red Bull Racing, complete with accommodations in the UK, an Infiniti car lease and a full salary.
Infiniti Motors describes this initiative as a “search for the world’s best and brightest emerging engineering talent.”
Zide’s journey in becoming a mechanical engineer was one that started at a young age.
“I started going to car races when I was three months old,” Zide said. “When I was growing up, I worked on cars with my dad, and started racing cars when I was eight. Ever since, I have loved cars, so going into mechanical engineering was the natural fit for me.”
Today, Zide is heavily involved in USC Racing, a design team that competes in the Formula Society of Automotive Engineers. Every year, the organization designs, builds and tests a race car from scratch.
“Working on the team, and being project manager, has prepared me more than anything,” Zide said.
Additionally, Zide has interned for Nissan Infiniti twice, once in its design studio in La Jolla, California and another time in its technical center in Michigan.
“Both of these experiences were great, especially for this opportunity with the Infiniti Performance Engineering Academy,” Zide said. “I was able to familiarize myself with the engineering industry as well as the company itself.”
Currently, Zide is interning with Tesla Motors, where he is working for Chassis Systems. He will be working on projects that consist of design validation, Chassis fatigue and drive train rigidity testing.
“All of these experiences have given me real world experience with engineering,” Zide said.
The aspiring engineer also describes his experience in USC as essential in preparing him for a future in the field.
“The classes introduce a good understanding of the theory,” Zide said. “While my extracurriculars have provided me with real life practical skills. The two combined are important for becoming a well rounded engineer.”
When it comes to his plans for the future, Zide hopes to work for a Formula One team.
“Formula One is the pinnacle of motorsports, which is something I have been deeply involved in my whole life,” Zide said. “I believe the Infiniti Performance Academy is the perfect way to reach my goal.”
If he were to work for Formula One, Zide said that he would be most interested in working in the aerodynamics and the internal combustion engine aspect. Since Renault is the company that takes care of this for Red Bull Racing, it is unlikely Zide could take part in this now.
Even so, Zide says that he is still very interested in working in all aspects of the Red Bull Racing team, whether it would be aerodynamics or simulations.
Zide encourages everyone to work toward a career path in which his or her passions are a main focus.
“If you are genuinely passionate about something, you will want to work harder for it.” Zide said. “A career path that includes someone’s passion is the ideal path.”
Infiniti Motors will announce the winner of the Performance Engineering Academy on July 3.
“If I win, I will be simply astonished,” Zide said. “Working in Formula One has been a dream of mine since I was a child and to get the chance to work with my favorite Formula One team would be a dream come true.”

The largest undertaking will be the renovation of the University Village, with demolition of the old village beginning this summer and construction of the new buildings to follow and be completed in the fall 2017.
“We have over 80 projects that will start, finish, or both, this summer,” Joe Back, Associate Senior Vice President for Campus Development and Facilities Management said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Most of them are typical office, classroom, housing and laboratory upgrades, along with plenty of utility upgrades and maintenance projects.  All of these projects are important to the university and the various schools and departments that initiated them.”
Back said some of the more visible projects underway this summer are the McClintock hardscape and landscape improvement which will begin this week and is scheduled to be completed in spring 2015.
In addition, the “Wall of Troy” perimeter fence is well underway and should be completed by fall 2014.
Site utility work has begun for the new Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center, which will be at the corner of 34th Street and Watt Way. Construction will begin in the fall, and the building is scheduled to be completed by summer 2016, for use in the fall semester of that year.
Demolition and site work is also underway for the construction of Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall, a new building for the Marshall School of Business that will open fall 2016. Some demolition work has been completed for the new Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience, but full construction is not slated to begin until spring 2015.
In addition to new construction this summer, several ongoing projects will be completed and ready for use in the fall. The most notable of which is the new Wallis Annenberg Hall which will be completed this summer and in use during the next semester.
In addition, the Verna and Peter Dauterive Hall, made possible by a $30 million donation by USC trustee Verna B. Dauterive, will be completed and will be in use during the fall. The building will be the new home of the Price School of Public Policy and used for interdisciplinary collaboration in the social sciences. Back said the new building is a “significant addition to the campus at the Pardee Way entrance.”
Finally, construction on the 4th floor of Steven and Kathryn Sample Hall in the Campus Center is scheduled to be completed this summer and ready for use in the fall.
“This project builds out space that was left unfinished in the original campus center construction and provides new space for various student activity functions on one side of the floor and a new home for USC Roski School of Art & Design program known as ‘The Academy,’” Back said.
Back said that all projects were on schedule and on budget, but was not at liberty to discuss the costs of the construction at this time due to the number of projects and parties involved.
 
Is the ‘wall of Troy’ being redone around the entire campus or just the portion along Jefferson?
