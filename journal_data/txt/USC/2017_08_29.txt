Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
On Sunday afternoon, head coach Clay Helton released the football team’s official depth chart for USC’s season opener against Western Michigan on Saturday. The depth chart solidified the results of several position battles, but it also left other roster questions unanswered. 
With last year’s leading pass catchers JuJu Smith-Schuster and Darreus Rogers both gone to the NFL, wide receiver was the biggest question mark for the Trojans’ offense this offseason. While redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns and sophomore Michael Pittman Jr. were in the mix for starting spots, experience won out as junior Jalen Greene and senior Steven Mitchell Jr. are slotted as the outside receivers for week one — although Pittman’s status is uncertain, as he’s been dealing with an injury. Junior Rose Bowl hero Deontay Burnett rounds out the receiving corps at the slot position, and junior Tyler Petite and redshirt sophomore Daniel Imatorbhebhe are listed as co-starters for tight end. 
On the offensive line, redshirt senior center Nico Falah and senior right guard Viane Talamaivao retain their starting positions from last year. They are joined by experienced and versatile redshirt junior Toa Lobendahn (21 career starts at four different positions) at left tackle, and juniors Chris Brown and Chuma Edoga man the two guard spots. 
In the backfield, junior Ronald Jones II begins the season as the sole starter at running back for the first time in his career. Meanwhile, the eclectic group of junior Aca’Cedric Ware, redshirt freshman Vavae Malepeai and freshman Stephen Carr will share the second string role, likely rotating based on the in-game situation.
While redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold was the undoubted starter heading into this season, the Trojans did have an interesting competition to decide his understudy. Redshirt freshman Matt Fink ended up in the backup role, beating out true freshman Jack Sears. 
On offense, Helton also had to replace several key players from last year’s defensive unit. The loss of Stevie Tu’ikolovatu left a massive hole at nose tackle both figuratively and literally. Filling his shoes will be 315-pound senior Josh Fatu, who got the edge over fellow senior Kenny Bigelow Jr. and freshman Marlon Tuipulotu on the depth chart. Rounding out the defensive line are juniors Rasheem Green and Malik Dorton, both archetypal 3-4 defensive ends. 
Incumbent starting outside linebackers junior Porter Gustin and senior Uchenna Nwosu re-assume their roles, and junior Cameron Smith will return to the inside linebacker spot. Lining up next to Smith will be third-year sophomore John Houston Jr., who is backed up by Levi Jones — another true freshman who could see significant playing time right away.
Experienced juniors Iman Marshall, Ajene Harris and Marvell Tell III all return to bolster USC’s defensive backfield. At the cornerback spot opposite Marshall, sophomore Jack Jones earned the first-string nod and the unenviable task of replacing Adoree’ Jackson (the outspoken Jones likely won’t let the pressure get to him — he’s already predicting he will compete for the Heisman Trophy). Replacing the graduated Leon McQuay III at strong safety is team captain Chris Hawkins. The fifth-year senior with 22 starts under his belt brings plenty of experience and leadership to the Trojan secondary. 
When Matt Boermeester was first suspended from USC in February, the Trojans’ placekicking situation was uncertain. Now, six months later, there still appears to be little clarity as to who will start in place of the dismissed kicker. On the depth chart, Helton listed redshirt freshman Michael Brown and freshman walk-on Chase McGrath as co-starters, and unless a starter is named sometime this week, the competition could end up continuing into the regular season. 
Overall the Trojans have seven returning starters on offense and seven on defense. Of all starters, only three (Darnold, Houston and Jones) are underclassmen. 
Trevor you need help with your reporting. How can both Chuma Edoga and Chris Brown both be at guard when
Viane Talamaivao has one of those positions secured. You mean one of the above is at the tackle spot . Depth
chart means a 2nd team which you make no mention of really. Why didn’t you just list the chart with no comments
which would make you look less incompetent than your incorrect rhetoric.

Will Alpert | Daily Trojan
The women’s volleyball team started the new season off with a bang last weekend, and on Monday, the Women of Troy earned their first award of the year, as sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week.
The second-year star spearheaded the Trojan attack in the USC/LMU Tournament, as the Women of Troy beat Loyola Marymount, No. 16 Michigan and Albany in four sets to take home the tourney crown. Lanier led USC with 13 kills in the team’s season opener at LMU, also tallying a service ace and contributing defensively with a team-high nine digs.
She continued to lead the Trojans in kills against the Wolverines (19) and the Great Danes (16) — recording her first double-double of the year versus Michigan — and she spread three aces across the two remaining matches. In all, Lanier finished the weekend triple-header with 48 kills, averaging 4.36 kills per set and a .400 hitting percentage, along with four aces and 27 digs.
Following a dazzling freshman season, last weekend’s strong performances kicked off Lanier’s follow-up campaign in encouraging fashion. Lanier debuted with 16 double-doubles in 2016 and led her team with 491 kills. Her 1,406 attacks were the third-highest single-season tally in program history, behind Asia Kaczor (1,542, 2007) and three-time All-American outside hitter Samantha Bricio (1,615, 2015).
Though this is Lanier’s first career Offensive Player of the Week honor, Monday marked her second career weekly conference award (she was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Week last October). The sophomore became the first Trojan to earn Offensive Player of the Week since Bricio earned the accolade in 2015. Overall, the Women of Troy have notched 83 conference honors in program history.
Lanier and the Women of Troy now look to build on an undefeated start this week. They will be in Omaha, Neb., on Friday for the start of the Bluejay Invitational, and they will open the weekend against Northern Iowa.
No. 18 USC will then play a doubleheader on Saturday, taking on host
No. 7 Creighton and then No. 13 Kentucky.
The tournament kicks off a lengthy string of road matches for the Women of Troy, and the team won’t play in the Galen Center until late September, when USC faces off against Oregon State for its Pac-12 home opener. Before the Trojans take on the Beavers on Sept. 24, they will travel to Santa Barbara, Calif., for the UCSB Thunderdome Classic; College Park, Md. for the Maryland Challenge; and finally Westwood for the start of conference play against archrival
No. 11 UCLA.

People are sincerely convinced that the boxing bout between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor was the biggest sporting event taking place this past Saturday. Let me tell you, they are sorely deceived. 
The biggest fight this past weekend did not take place in a boxing ring. Instead, it took place within the confines of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
Thousands upon thousands entered through the Coliseum turnstiles this past Saturday to catch a glimpse of the monumental Week 3 preseason matchup between the Los Angeles Chargers and Los Angeles Rams. This was the battle for Los Angeles. And in stunning fashion, a preseason bout between the Chargers and Rams eclipsed the mega-fight between Mayweather and McGregor in the sports universe —
If you haven’t caught the sarcasm by now, let me cut the rhetoric. 
There was no dazzling spectacle at the Coliseum this past weekend. There was only a meaningless contest between two competitors who are locked in a stalemate for winning the hearts and attention of the L.A. fanbase. 
On Saturday the Rams announced that they “distributed” a total of 58,561 tickets for their game against the Chargers. A quick glance around the Coliseum on Saturday would suggest that was quite the generous figure for fans in attendance. There were several gaping patches of red, empty seats visible during the game. Then again, to be fair, it is preseason football, and it’s a challenge to fill up the Coliseum, which seats up to 93,607. 
For the Chargers, playing in front of over 58,000 spectators was a huge change of scenery. Over the first two weeks of the preseason, the Chargers played in front of crowds of 21,054 and 21,197, respectively, at their new home, the StubHub Center. 
Again, it is preseason. However, failing to fill StubHub — a 27,000-seat soccer stadium — for two consecutive weeks is not a good look for a newly located franchise. If you’re the Chargers, it’d be nice to at least be in the 24,000-26,000 range for attendance, right? I mean the Galaxy were able to pack over 25,000 fans into StubHub the night before the Chargers’ preseason opener against the Seattle Seahawks on Aug. 13. 
“I really don’t think that anyone [in Los Angeles] is really salivating at the mouth for professional football,” said Alex Hsiung, a 26-year-old resident of the city who turned down the opportunity to purchase season tickets. “Whatever team does well first is going to gain the biggest following. Whoever wins first will get the bandwagon going for that specific team … a lot will ride on this season.”
The Rams had a fantastic opening season in Los Angeles last year, as far as home attendance goes. Only the Dallas Cowboys drew more fans to their home contests last season.
However, it’s hard to believe that a team coming off of a 4-12 season has stellar projections for fan turnout this fall. For the Rams, losing 11 of their final 12 games isn’t necessarily the best recipe for building up hype for a fanbase in Los Angeles. 
The Chargers, who finished last season at 5-11 overall, aren’t necessarily bringing the biggest of hype trains to Los Angeles, either. The Chargers failed to make the playoffs over their final four seasons in San Diego, and with a 35-year-old quarterback, the window is smaller than it is big for the Bolts.
Speaking to people around the city, it’s clear that Angelenos don’t find the Rams’ growing pains and the Chargers’ recent futility very compelling. Many just don’t feel like Los Angeles has a culture for the NFL as both teams struggle to gain a following.
What’s most dangerous for the Chargers and Rams — teams vying to win the loyalty of a competitive L.A. fanbase — is the competition they face throughout in the city. In a sports metropolis like Los Angeles, it can be very easy to become forgettable. In the battle for L.A. sports supremacy, the Chargers and Rams must be wary of finding themselves on the undercard. 
It’s easy to imagine that if the Los Angeles Dodgers make a push for the World Series, they will dominate the L.A. sports market from an exposure standpoint. If USC goes on to realize its national championship expectations, you’d also have to think they’d steal some of the spotlight from Los Angeles’ pro football franchises. And if Lonzo-mania sparks at the Staples Center, forget it. A pair of mediocre NFL teams very well may find themselves on the back-burner of L.A. sports fandom. 
After all, how can the Rams and Chargers dominate the sports spotlight when USC may be making a national championship run this season? The NFL teams’ local competition goes beyond just football, too. The Dodgers and Lakers could both have strong seasons, meaning the Rams and Chargers would play their entire regular seasons under those other teams’ headlines. It would become playoffs-or-bust for the Rams and Bolts — a mentality neither team is well-equipped for.
The Chargers’ widely promoted slogan for this season has been “Fight for L.A.” It’s safe to say that in the battle between Bolts and Horns, everything will come down to one factor: winning. The first franchise to deliver Los Angeles a slice of NFL glory will gain the allegiance of many title-hungry Angelenos.

I consider myself to be an honest person. I don’t typically lie. That being said, I feel like there should be a big asterisk next to the word “typically.” There are obviously situations in which telling a white lie can save one a lot of headache and heartbreak. For instance, when my boyfriend asks me if what he is wearing is “cute,” I’ll tell him yes, regardless of if I think the outfit is stylish or absolutely heinous. The same goes for when people ask me where I graduated from college. I’ll say I went to USC, which is true, but if we’re going to get technical, no matter what I say is a lie because I never actually earned my diploma.
I’ve always been a sucker for nostalgia; it’s hard to find a millennial who isn’t keen on some era of the past. However, it doesn’t seem like too many people (or at least the ones I hang out with) have any desire to actually relive their past, like their college years. For most, the college years aren’t necessarily ones most are eager to relive. Who wants to go back to hall bathrooms, or walking into 8 a.m. lectures with dried semen from last night’s hookup whitewashed on your shirt? 
The answer is: me. I would love to revel in these high points of my past life, like going to class so hungover I actually start seeing spots. But maybe that’s just my inner romantic, because it saddens me to think there are things I’ll never get to experience again, such as my first trip to the opera or the time I finally got to watch Morrissey perform live. But I think about the people I’ll never see again, or the things I’ll never hear again, and am reminded that I should never say never because of all the things I never thought I’d ever hear again, the phrase that tops the list just happened to reappear as the subject line of an email I received just last week.
“Welcome back, Trojans!” it read.
Like I said, I don’t find any point in lying. I prefer to skirt around situations with creative phrasing to prevent myself from uttering the dreaded fib. Perhaps that’s why I’ve felt so jaded for the past year and three months, because when I tell people that I “graduated,” it’s not the whole truth. In fact, there is no truth to it at all. Yes, I did walk during that year’s ceremony, but that’s the closest I got to my diploma. In reality, I was two classes short of earning my degree. However, I was also about to begin an internship that could define my entire professional career as a writer. So I had a decision to make: return in the fall to finish up, or pretend that I did and move on. I chose the latter.
My first year out of school into the world was a rollercoaster —literally. Really, I mean to say I peaked too soon. Within weeks of  “graduating,” I began an internship at a film & TV magazine, one that had promised me a job following my tenure as an intern. But, in what I can only assume to be karma, I was lied to. I had assumed I would be offered an editorial position, but was only offered a freelance writing position. Though I was given incredible opportunities for consistent work to support myself as a freelance writer, it came with none of the perks of a full-time position: no health insurance, no 401(k). Being able to afford an apartment is nice and all, but knowing that at any point I could be hit in the head by a slab of rogue plaster and have no way to pay for the medical expenses doesn’t really sit well with me. My  farce as “the graduate” went on for a little over a year, before I ultimately decided that the best thing for me is to return to school. So two weeks ago, I contacted my academic adviser and I was officially re-enrolled.
 Those who know me well and had assumed I “graduated” on time were floored when I revealed the plot twist. I joked to my friends that the only other secret I kept was hiding in the closet for the first 15 years of my life. I had fooled just about everyone, my parents included, into thinking I graduated. Apart from my academic adviser and myself, no one knew. I had essentially scammed those in my life into thinking I had earned a sheet of stock paper estimated at over $200 grand. 
In the end, it’s not even really about the diploma. I guess what I’m yearning for is to return to USC for one last hurrah. And for that matter, why does this fancy paper determine our worth in society? At risk of sounding like an elitist, it’s almost impossible to sustain a comfortable living without a college degree, especially in Los Angeles. In a way, I felt that leaving early was a giant middle finger to society. As students, we’re taught to learn from our mistakes. We’re also taught to never let our past define our future. So how are we expected to learn from said mistakes if we’re simultaneously supposed to forget about them as well? But I guess I’m not the most reliable person for life advice. At (almost) 26 years old, it’s taken seven and a half years for me to obtain a bachelor’s degree.
But I shouldn’t let my past define my character, because I’m redefining my future by finishing what I started. And I’m ready to go, from the top.

“Is she about to rap?” asked my roommate as we pressed play on Taylor Swift’s new single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” and heard the progression of 90s-esque minor chords. The single comes from Swift’s long-awaited sixth studio album, reputation, which is slated for release this November. Luckily, Swift did not rap. She did, however, confidently put out the most pitiful piece of pop music since “Gangnam Style.” On “Look What You Made Me Do,” Swift awakens her forgotten feud with the Kardashian-Wests in a graceless and anti-climactic cacophony that leaves listeners torn between laughter and pity.
Throughout her career, Swift has been known to artfully transform real-life experiences into lyrics — a reputation that has her fans diligently investigating her music for clues most often pertaining to ex-boyfriends. Though “Look” isn’t shy about pointing the generic finger, a certain lyric has already led to a string of hypotheses. “I don’t like your tilted stage,” Swift sings — or rather, says — referring rather blatantly to the floating tilted stage rapper Kanye West famously debuted on his Saint Pablo tour.
Like a majority of the track’s supposedly insulting lyrics, this one is remarkably comical. Swift and West found themselves feuding last year following a lyric in West’s song “Famous”: “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex. Why? I made that bitch famous.” Swift went on to publicly condemn West in an eloquent speech at the Grammys, warning young women that others will try to take credit for their fame. In her husband’s defense, Kim Kardashian-West leaked the recording of a phone conversation between West and Swift, in which Swift acknowledged and expressed approval of West’s lyrics.
However, with the untimely release of Swift’s track, it seems that the pop star is intent on rehashing tabloid drama the world indulged in and dismissed months ago in order to focus on more pressing issues. Lyrics like “I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time,” are baffling. The entire song dwells in the past tense, but listeners have no idea what Swift is talking about. Is this track supposed to exemplify how she got smarter?  What did West make her do? Because from where most of the Internet was watching, it looked like Swift was the one getting schooled.
It’s unclear whether the usually adept Swift saw this colossal blunder of a track as some sort of femme fatale narrative; with its oddball interpolation of Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy” and almost embarrassing lyrics, the song seems like a desperate attempt to interject the final say from a musician who knows she will top charts despite the quality of her product — the melody of which, moreover, sounds like a medley of several different incongruous songs.
And of course, there’s that bizarre bridge, where the “new” Swift, or perhaps the snake on her Instagram, answers a landline of all things, to make the album’s cliché message clear: “I’m sorry, the old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now. Why? Oh, cause she’s dead!” Does that mean Swift’s career of heartbreak ballads is over? Can we expect to find rap battles on the upcoming album? And most importantly, will her incessant blunders ever stop being memes?
Although we won’t know what Swift’s career holds until the release of her album, fans did receive an answer to the latter question with the premiere of the single’s music video at Sunday’s MTV Video Music Awards. 
In the video, Swift clings to her baroque essence — bathing in a tub of jewels, sitting atop a throne while a snake pours her tea, crashing a gold Maserati with a Grammy in hand, as if to take a glamorous approach to free falling. In the midst of all that sparkle, however, is dense symbolism referring to Swift’s most famous tabloid moments. To name a few, there’s the Nils Sjoberg gravestone, the “Et tu Brute” carving on her throne, the army of perfect mannequins. 
In the video’s finale, 14 versions of Swift’s former self bicker among one another while one stands in the back, reiterating her most famous criticisms: “There she goes, playing the victim, again,” says biker Swift to country Swift. But the finger-pointing returns with 2009 MTV Video Music Awards Swift: “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative,” she says, referring to the note she wrote in response to Kim Kardashian’s phone recording.

Taylor Swift is back — and she’s finally shed her skin.
In one of the most stunning comebacks in recent music history, Swift “rose up from the dead” with a single proclamation in her heel-turning single “Look What You Made Me Do”: The “old Taylor” is officially dead. Since its release, “Look” — the lead single from her upcoming album reputation — has provoked polarizing discussions among pop culture consumers, and whether or not Swift’s scornful return will mark the demise of a gifted songstress. 
Make no mistake: Swift is hellbent on revenge, and she’s coming for blood. I couldn’t process the moment when I first listened to the track on Thursday evening. My jaw dropped by the time she chanted her first chorus, and I was left in disbelief. I’ll be honest — I expected a bubble pop diss, but what I got was a darker, more aggressive “Blank Space 2.0.” And I loved every part of it. 
I can agree with other listeners that “Look” is not as profound in lyrical content. While some may argue that Swift has sacrificed deep narrative writing at the expense of thinly veiled attacks against her adversaries, the “Bad Blood” singer nevertheless displayed a talent that only pop geniuses possess: the ability to deliver a mantra and statement that become ingrained in every listener’s head. Whether or not people like the track, “Look” has become both a cultural phenomenon and a testament to Swift’s identity as a ubiquitous force in music. Most importantly, it reaffirms yet another hotly debated topic — Taylor Swift’s status as a modern pop icon.
Within a day of the song’s release, “Look What You Made Me Do” received polarizing opinions from both listeners and critics. People had a lot of questions. What did we make her do? Who is the new Taylor? One of the most prevalent criticisms of “Look” is that Swift is attempting to rehash the stale drama that left her publicly shamed and disparaged in 2016. The single was deemed “melodramatic,” “petulant, “tired” and “outdated” in a flurry of scathing reviews.
But why shouldn’t Taylor Swift sing that she doesn’t like Kanye West’s tilted stage? After all, male artists have done it from time to time without receiving direct character attacks. Drake and Meek Mill clapped back at each other in “Back to Back” and “Wanna Know,” respectively. Neil Young took a jab at Lynyrd Skynrd in “Southern Man” and Alabama.”   Guns N’ Roses released “Get in the Ring” to get back at music critics who wronged them. 
It’s the same argument that Swift made in 2014: If male artists can write about their emotions and get away with it, then why can’t she? Swift’s critics are blinded by a layer of internalized misogyny that’s forced them to align with the notion that she can’t afford to react to her experiences through her own lens. I don’t care to know the truth behind her feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West — all I can say is that I admire Taylor Swift for standing her ground, staying true to her style of deeply personal songwriting and not giving a flying f-ck about what anyone thinks of her.
Swift’s anger in “Look” is not unwarranted; in fact, it’s understandable. After being placed under a microscope by the press for several years, Swift was spammed with snake emojis across social media platforms, scrutinized for engendering fragile, white feminism and labeled as an opportunist who exploits every situation to play the victim. To release a record with such a different tone takes a truly confident woman, and Swift managed to channel her rage and pain with a cool surliness that defies her musical conventions. 
Again, I’ll say it: Taylor Swift is a musical sensation and icon of our generation. “Look” is sonically different from everything she’s created so far, and it’s a sign that Swift is a pop chameleon (or a snake, for that matter). It’s incongruous, it’s strange — some might not even call it pop — but it’s a cynical, emblematic piece of iconography that will echo in everyone’s minds for several months to come. Taylor Swift has been deliberate and intentional on every creative front, and in “Look” she continues to push the boundary of the intersections between music and identity.
The “Look” music video, which ends with 14 effigies of past Taylor Swifts mocking each other, ties in everything Taylor Swift wants observers to know about her return. She’s a master of satire, owning every persona used against her. She’s a snake queen rising from the dead. And she’s the powerful artist reclaiming the brush — this time to paint her own narrative.
Taylor Swift knows you’ve been talking about her, and this is what you made her do. “Look” is a tour de force that has already destroyed records across the board. In 24 hours, the single was streamed 10.1 million times on Spotify, the largest global debut for a single track in the service’s history. Its music video surpassed 38 million YouTube views in one day, toppling Adele’s crown for “Hello” by a margin of more than 10 million views. And Billboard predicts that “Look” is headed for the largest digital sales week since “Hello.” 
If “Look What You Made Me Do” is only the beginning of this journey, I’m excited to see how Taylor Swift will dominate every conversation about pop music when reputation arrives.

Like so many on campus, I was shocked by the recent Los Angeles Times investigation into Dr. Carmen Puliafito, the former dean of USC’s Keck School of Medicine.
The Times’ bombshell report outlining Puliafito’s behavior while at USC — from partying with prostitutes and criminals to his documented drug use in the dean’s office on campus — is troubling, to say the least. But even more upsetting has been the University’s response, or lack of.
Even after he stepped down as Keck dean after the overdose of a female companion in a Pasadena hotel room, Puliafito remained at the Keck School, treating patients and teaching students for well over a year after his substance abuse and dangerous behavior was reported to University leadership.
While University leaders continue to dispute the details of what they knew about Puliafito and when — with Provost Quick maintaining that “the first time we saw such information firsthand” was shortly after the Times report — the one thing that isn’t in dispute is Puliafito’s incredible fundraising ability.
And therein lies the problem.
By all accounts, Puliafito had a preternatural ability to fill University coffers with high dollar donations. And while Puliafito’s behavior and the University’s continued inaction represent what I hope is an extreme example, where a lack of accountability for those at the top carried potentially deadly consequences for faculty and students, the story itself illustrates a much more common truth in higher education: The money comes first.
To be clear, the prioritizing of fundraising goals over student and faculty needs runs contrary to our educational mission and undermines our credibility as an “elite” institution. But it doesn’t have to be that way. 
In early 2016, I came together with colleagues from schools across the University to organize a faculty union at USC. And despite intense opposition from University administrators — including breaking federal labor law to discourage a union vote — we won our union election. In doing so, we won a real voice to advocate for our University’s mission and our students, and to fight back against the growing corporatization of higher education.
Already, we have exercised our collective power to hold University leadership accountable and prioritize student learning over University profits. We’ve fought to protect the integrity of our programs by prompting the resignation of an abusive director. We’ve won technology upgrades for our classrooms, ensuring that our students receive the best possible learning experience. And this is just the beginning.
As we enter our fall semester, unprecedented numbers of faculty and graduate students are organizing across campus to build a strong, diverse union that will hold our University accountable to its mission.
It’s simple, really. Strength in numbers gives us the power to advocate for our programs and the students we teach. It gives us the power to fight back against disturbing corporate trends in higher education. It gives us the power to demand transparency from University leaders when their inaction puts student and faculty lives in danger.
Academia needs strong unions, now more than ever. Join us.
The value of unions? OK. Kazuda, you make good sense.
But this statement doesn’t fit. Sorry, Kazuda. “To be clear, the prioritizing of fundraising goals over student and faculty needs runs contrary to our educational mission and undermines our credibility as an “elite” institution.”
Student and faculty needs? Where do you think that USC spends these funds? USC is one of the most generous universities in the world, spending a great deal of its funding on aid for those applicants and students who need the support!
One of the most generous? I see you aren’t on the inside. Your view is an outsider’s perspective. There’s more to USC than you see. They obviously can’t even bother to protect students or staff from abusive faculty as the Dean in Keck.
I should have been more specific. I meant generous in terms of aid to deserving students. You are apparently unaware of the great scope of USC’s programs, especially for minorities in the USC area. USC programs are huge and imaginative.
Not sure about the disgusting Dr. Carmen Puliafito, Dean of the Keck Medical School. I didn’t find any accounts that stated that the USC administration knew, or should have known, about his alleged criminal misbehavior. I guess that will come out soon from civil and criminal investigations.

Last Tuesday, ESPN announced its plan to keep Asian American sports broadcaster Robert Lee from calling a University of Virginia football game due to concern over — of all things — his name. The University of Virginia is located in Charlottesville, the site of recent disturbing and deadly white supremacist activity, and it so happens that broadcaster Robert Lee shares a name with Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general whose statue the white supremacists had been trying to protect. 
On ESPN’s part, it was a public relations move as detrimental as it was nonsensical. And indeed outcry did arise, though some of the criticism was indubitably malicious: On Fox News, former ESPN reporter Britt McHenry complained about what she perceived to be the work of the crazed and overly careful left. 
And yet, it’s unfortunate that McHenry and others chose to slyly endorse Robert E. Lee under the guise of condemning ESPN’s decision — for the decision, indeed, deserves to be re-studied, but not because ESPN had the decency to ally itself with those who marched against white supremacy in Charlottesville. It’s because, at the end of the day, Robert Lee is an Asian American sports announcer in an industry where few Asian Americans succeed, forced to switch games because of nothing more than his very common Asian surname.
One is forced to question if things would’ve gone differently if Lee’s surname was something more European: Robert Smith,  Robert Brown or the like. One must also speculate why ESPN — in all its thinking — did not realize that discriminating against an Asian American employee is fundamentally disparate from choosing the side against white supremacy. 
And yet, here’s a potential solution: Perhaps ESPN did not think it was choosing political sides at all. 
In an article from The New York Times about the decision, college sports writer Marc Tracy wrote that “the centripetal force of politics is bound to make a battlefield of almost anything,” and quoted ESPN historian James Andrew Miller as saying the network desires “to be as far away from geopolitical and cultural issues as they can be.” Maybe ESPN had a decision to make — politics in sports or no politics in sports — and chose the latter, not realizing every action about race has sociopolitical consequences, regardless of intention.
On a similar note, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick is still under the national spotlight for deciding not to stand for pre-game national anthems, a choice that has opened another divide in the sports fan community. Kaepernick cited his actions as support for minorities currently being oppressed by American society. The sentiment is apparent: He will not honor the symbols of a nation that does not honor its people of color. And yet, his choice came under harsh scrutiny — for being unpatriotic, anti-military — and Kaepernick today is unsigned to any team. However, his concern for the dark side of American symbolism remains glaringly relevant as President Donald Trump fashions a picture of an American flag as his Twitter cover photo, and yet deems the journalists who report on him unpatriotic, seemingly equating allegiance to the country with allegiance to his racist, oppressive agenda. 
Put simply, in an industry where the national anthem is played before everything from Little League games to the NFL and where people of color pose such a massive role, one cannot support athlete’s bodies and physical feats without at least acknowledging their political stances. One cannot also — like ESPN — pretend to be colorblind in the hopes that it will erase political ramifications. 
Furthermore, everyone knows the wide reach of athletics, which is why last year’s Super Bowl saw commercials that painted a picture of a diverse and resilient America in the face of Trump’s election, and why some of history’s greatest rebellions against political oppression and adversity happened in the athletic arena. 
What ESPN and Kaepernick’s critics fail to understand is that sports are political, have always been political and will always be political — no matter what.

First off, I think readers should know that according to Disqus, I have been “banned” by the Daily Trojan.  I am discussing this with my attorney but meanwhile I’m posting under a different account.  We’ll see how “tolerant” of diverse opinion the DT is.
Meanwhile, to be clear, there are many decent, non-racist people who present good arguments for keeping confederate statues up.  This is a nuanced conversation.  People on the Left don’t argue, they label.  More importantly… Please do not politicize sports.  It’s the one area of our lives where we can generally come together and set aside differences…. Or compete in healthy and fair competition.  In fact, the liberal ethos simply doesn’t work with sports.  It’s a meritocracy.  Nobody cares if the team is predominantly black, or white, or Latino, or male.  It’s all about skill and ability.  Of course sadly this was not always the case, but even when we reflect and celebrate heroes like Jackie Robinson, we realize that he didn’t break the color barrier because he was black… It’s because he was an outstanding ball player… And society (and Major League Baseball) realized that it was not only wrong to exclude blacks, but it was also foolish.  The bottom line is that society could learn a lot from sports.  Open mindedness, inclusion, sportsmanship, all without concern for each other’s race, but whilst also demanding excellence, growth and a winning attitude.
It’s really a shame that someone at the DT (and other readers) block me or report my comments as spam.
red pill
Much as I admire players’ football skills, I doubt that they’re any more qualified to give me political advice than my barber. Miss Cheng may want me to give a rat’s behind about what Kaepernick thinks, but she might want to consider what they’re paid to do which is provide entertainment.
Righ you are, Tom. It’s often tedious when famous athletes and entertainers pop off with idiotic political opinions, or worse yet, commit ignorant protesting acts.  Can’t be helped. They have huge audiences and that grants them great authority to speak, however much their opinions are vapid and fatuous. 
The worst one for this that I have observed is Roseanne Barr. Her allegations that Pres. G. W. Bush commissioned the 9/11 sneak attack are absolutely astonishing. And I suppose that her fans have accepted this truly bizarre conspiracy theory as established fact.
ESPN made yet another blunder.  They’re just too scared and made a mountain out of a small pile of dirt.  Caved in.  How silly.  Politics and sports/entertainment do not belong together.
Zoe, when a sports fan watches a game, the last thing they want to see is a player spouting political or religious beliefs.  There’s plenty of room for that off the field.  We, as sports fans, want an escape from that bull%$&@.  Got it?  Good.  Now go write some drivel about Trump, feminism, and racism and leave sports out of it.
Zoe writes “. . . ESPN and Kaepernick’s critics fail to understand is that sports are political, have always been political and will always be political — no matter what.” I dispute that. Politics is the seeking, or exercise of, power and influence among organized groups.
The cynical, unpatriotic malcontent athletes who reject and scorn our country, a country that has made them multimillionaires, do not fit within that concept. They are outraged over white supremacy, the Confederacy, or a small number of ill-trained and unsuitable policemen? OK, they should say that, but instead, in front of stadium crowds and millions of viewers on TV – they choose to dishonour and sneer at their country and those of us who love it.
All lives matter.  And why should the country “honor” people of color?  That’s discriminatory. 
Tell us exactly what Trump has done or said to brand him a racist and oppressor.  You are of narrow and shallow intellect, however it’s easy to see why you may gain favor with other post-post-pubesent, micro-cephalics.

Lunderful, your comments that I read in the DT have been pertinent, accurate and sharp. Not this time. Yes, tear apart writer Zoe Cheng’s illogic, but please do not use personal insults against her. You called her of narrow shalow intellect and lumped her among other . . . microcephalics. Disagree, critque, yes, do it. But please do not launch personal attacks against writers here.
Among other of her unfounded claims is that Trump is a racist.  Re-read her tripe. And investigate Trump’s public statements.  I reserve the right to blast anyone in any mode or measure who slings cheap, unsubstantiated, drive-by insults couched as commentary.
Lunderful, of course you have that right. And I agree that her rant is full of tripe. I’m on your side. But if a writer didn’t insult you, why go after the writer personally? Instead, I respectfully suggest that you demolish the stupidity in the stuff you read, point-by-point. Your replies and comments here will carry a lot more authority if you do that.

As the number of first generation college students grows on campus, the First Generation Mentorship Program seeks to provide assistance and resources to this expanding niche of students. For this year’s freshmen class, 16 percent are first generation — a 3 percent increase from last year — and as USC seeks to diversify and offer opportunities for students from all backgrounds, this number should increase in the coming years. 
Founded in 2008, the First Generation Mentorship Program aims to help students who may lack guidance or preparation for college by pairing them with alumni who were also first generation students.
“We really focus on professional development, so we do our best to pair students with alumni who work in their career fields,” said Gina Ibrahim, USC’s internship and diversity programs adviser. “We find that the basis of the program is having that common ground of understanding what it was like to be at USC as a first generation student and finding out what resources are available to you.”  
The program is open to all first generation students, and they are encouraged to apply after having completed a full academic semester at USC. On average, the program fluctuated between 25 to 30 mentors each year. This year, the program saw a surge of some 60 mentors applying, 40 of which were accepted after meeting the required criteria. 
Ibrahim notes an especially large increase in the number of Viterbi alumni applying for this year’s program. For the 2015-2016 school year, the program had four Viterbi alumni, and this year 19 will participate. 
Employer relations and research director Jennifer Kim said she hopes the increase in interested mentors will lead to an increase in applications.
“You would think everyone would be interested, but it’s difficult to explain why more students don’t apply,” Kim said. “Otherwise, we would definitely try to grow the program.” 
The program is targeted towards students’ professional goals and their intended career paths, exposing them to a mentor and a role model who can guide their development.
“As a first generation student, sometimes it’s a little harder to find a support system or to find the resources that are available to you on campus because you’re the first person in your family to go to college,” Ibrahim said. “Your parents or your older siblings might not have the information that you were seeking.” 
The goal of the program is to form an organic mentor-mentee bond between alumni and students, Kim said. The Career Center also hosts monthly events between October and April that discuss resume building, networking and interviewing. 
“We try to balance [the program] out by having some formal programming so everyone has sort of the same experience,” Kim said. “We’re hoping that organically they choose to meet up outside, to speak on the phone…We’re hoping that it just grows into a friendship, a mentorship.” 
Mentors are asked to attend the monthly group meetings as well as put in extra effort to either speak or meet with their mentee throughout the academic year. 
“We do ask a lot of [the mentors],” Kim said. “They’re really accommodating to the students…They’re going out of their way to physically be here [on campus] and to meet with them outside of the formal program.” 
Currently, 13 percent of the USC undergraduate student body is first generation, according to the University. 
“I think students sometimes don’t understand the value in having a mentor, and this is a good way to test the waters,” Kim said. “Then you can see the importance of a mentor-mentee relationship and what impact that can have on your academics, your personal life, your professional life.”

Douglas Manuel stumbled upon poetry by chance. 
Manuel, a Middleton and Dornsife Fellow and a doctoral candidate in literature and creative writing, focuses his writing on the turmoil confronting a black man in 21st-century America. 
Earlier this year, Manuel published his first collection of poems in a book, Testify, where he spoke on  these issues. 
His works have been featured on the Poetry Foundation’s website and have won him multiple awards — yet Manuel did not originally plan to become a poet. 
Manuel began his literary career as an undergraduate student studying creative writing at Arizona State University, where he delved into fiction writing. Yet he explains that fiction writing just didn’t seem to stick.
“What I realized is that I kind of wrote the same story every time, kind of this young black guy that can’t find himself, who has lots of white friends, so he feels out of place,” Manuel said.
Mentor and English professor Bob Haynes suggested that Manuel take his poetry class, and Manuel was hooked immediately.
“I found friends dead and alive in poetry books — then I wanted to see if I could do it,” Manuel said. “Also, I knew I wanted to do something with the least injustice as possible to the world. One of my favorite quotes from Mark Doty is, ‘The world will never be worse off from somebody creating another poem.’”
Manuel’s poems are rooted in his upbringing and coming-of-age experiences, and his reconciliation with the looming questions of his identity as he is caught between two worlds: his father’s house and his private Catholic school.
“I think the two biggest catalysts of Testify would be my mom’s death when I was 8 and my father’s long prison sentence,” Manuel said. “I was raised by my auntie … so, I was always kind of straddling those two worlds. I was always told when I was in the black space … I wasn’t black enough and then when I was at school, suddenly, I was too black — I always felt out of place.” 
Manuel’s personal struggles were reflected in his poems, as he worked to figure out who he was, beyond the influence of society and his father’s past. 
As a poet, some of Manuel’s biggest literary inspirations include black poets Yusef Komunyakaa and James Baldwin. Manuel writes for 30 minutes to an hour a day and explains that conquering the blank page is the most difficult part of writing . 
While the young poet doesn’t believe in writer’s block, he acknowledges the hurdles of getting started and encourages writers to always put something at the top of the page, whether that be the prompt or a quote, just to get the ball rolling.
In addition to pursuing a doctorate degree, Manuel was also the poetry editor for Gold Line Press and a managing editor for Ricochet Editions, a small line of presses run by students and alumni from the university’s Ph. D. program in creative writing. Manuel’s poems have also appeared in numerous places including the Rhino, North American Review, The Chattahoochee Review, New Orleans Review, Crab Creek Review and Many Mountains Moving.
Manuel also has poetry readings on a regular basis, where he aims to bring body to the poetry he is so passionate about. He also recently performed a poetry reading at the Claremont Public Library on Sunday.
However, Manuel is only getting started. Upon finishing up his doctorate degree, Manuel hopes to jump into the worlds of academia, publishing or nonprofits.

Provost Michael Quick reaffirmed the University’s support for undocumented students protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in an email memorandum sent Monday afternoon.
The memo comes on the heels of Donald Trump’s threats to end the DACA program, which has come under scrutiny during the Trump administration. 
“We remain committed to our shared values of diversity, inclusion, and non-discrimination,” Quick wrote in the memo. “We will do everything possible to ensure that our students have access to the services and support necessary for them to thrive while at USC and to graduate from their chosen degree programs.”
Along with highlighting some of the campus resources available to DACA students, Quick explained that student records will not be shared with law enforcement without student consent or a judicial order.
Quick also recommended that students under DACA not exit the country in the coming weeks “given the uncertainty surrounding the future of the DACA program.” 
According to the Pew Research Center, the program currently protects over 750,000 young unauthorized immigrants who came to the United States before age 16, also known as “Dreamers.” It allows them to qualify for work permits and receive deportation relief as long as they are enrolled in high school, have a high school degree and have no serious criminal conviction. 
The program protects those who qualify for a period of two years, and benefits can be renewed. Barack Obama created the program through an executive action in 2012. 
In the memo, Quick assigned Vanessa Gomez Brake, associate dean of religious life, as a point of contact for immigrant and international student support.
“While there is no doubt we are living in uncertain and turbulent times, there is also no doubt that we will continue to embrace our Principles of Community that outline our commitment to diversity and tolerance,” Quick wrote. “We remain steadfast in our enduring belief in the power and promise of the Trojan Family as an extraordinary global community of support, healing, and transformation.”
