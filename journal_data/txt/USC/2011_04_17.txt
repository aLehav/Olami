Senior Day at McDonald’s Swim Stadium might not have started off the right way, but it ended perfectly for USC.
The No. 4 USC women’s water polo team finished regular season play Saturday, sending its four seniors out with a 13-10 win, and snapping No. 7 San Jose State’s four-game winning streak.
Despite a six-goal day from San Jose State’s Adriana Vogt, the Women of Troy (16-5, 4-3) were aided by a balanced attack.
Senior two-meter Kristen Dronberger registered a hat trick in her final home match. Senior driver Joelle Bekhazi also had two goals, as did junior driver Nadia Dan and freshman two-meter Madeline Rosenthal.
USC struggled offensively in the first half, although its defense held strong. The Women of Troy limited the Spartans (20-10, 2-4) to just one goal in the second period, leaving the score tied 5-5 at halftime.
USC started the third period strong and never looked back.
Sophomore two-meter Patricia Jancso, Rosenthal, sophomore driver Blair Moody, senior two-meter Sarah Van Norman and junior two-meter Kara-Leigh Huse all registered goals before San Jose State could score their first goal of the period.
In general, the team was pleased with the final score and its performance.
“I thought that we just coming at them,” Dronberger said. “The offense kept going and going. We didn’t play the best defense but there are things that we can improve on all the time … We really, really played to our benefit”
USC coach Jovan Vavic was also happy with the team’s success, especially given its past losses this season to Stanford and UCLA.
“We did a good job in the areas with our set up plays, to set up an offensive attack,” Vavic said. “Six-on-5 was better than our last few games and we scored more percentage-wise than the last few games. We just have to defend better.”
The game was delayed 15 minutes because the scoreboard at McDonald’s Swim Stadium faced technical difficulties, and officials eventually decided to begin the game with a dysfunctional scoreboard. The, players, however, were not fazed.
“If anything [the scoreboard being broken] was helping us focus on the game and not worry about the scoreboard,” Bekhazi said. “It really helped us stay in the game.”
With the regular season complete, the Women of Troy will focus on the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament, slated to begin April 29. Heading into the tournament, the team will be ranked as a No. 5 seed.
“Like every single team that goes into this home stretch of the season, we only have one thing on our minds and that is to win it all,” Dronberger said. “We are going to have a tough couple weeks of training coming up before tournament play and we just need to put our nose to the grindstone and work as hard as we possibly can.”

With strong efforts from senior opposite Murphy Troy, senior Riley McKibbin and senior opposite hitter Tri Bourne, the USC men’s volleyball senior class demonstrated why they are one of the best to ever grace the Galen Center hardwood. In a thrilling match from start to finish, No. 1 USC outlasted No. 6 UC Santa Barbara in three sets, winning 25-21, 25-21, 30-28.
Stellar play · Senior opposite Murphy Troy finished with 10 kills and six blocks in USC’s regular-season home finale against No. 6 UCSB. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“[The seniors] resurrected this program,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “We’re nowhere without them.”
Despite the sweep, USC was forced to grind out each set. Ferguson said he appreciated the opportunity to play a competitive match in preparation for the postseason.
“This was a great match for us to play going into the playoffs,” Ferguson said. “They’re one of the few teams in the league that’s as big and physical as we are. We can’t just overpower them.”
A poor Gaucho service game distinguished the two teams on Saturday night. While the Trojans complemented their eight service errors with four aces, the Gauchos’ one ace did not compensate for their 15 service errors.
“I thought we served pretty well,” Ferguson said. “You always want to do a little bit better. Tony [Ciarelli] and Murphy [Troy] got them in trouble with some tough serves, and I think it was fitting that Riley [McKibbin] ended the match with an ace.”
Although the Gauchos’ serving woes helped, the Trojans’ strong play kept UCSB out of the match. Deep into the second set, junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, who had 13 kills at a blistering .550 clip, rocketed a ruthless kill off of an unsuspecting UC Santa Barbara player’s face.
Ferguson also noted USC’s blocking effort was outstanding, as the Trojans amassed several ‘roof’ blocks. All told, the Trojans out-blocked the Gauchos 12.5 to 3.
“As a team, we blocked fantastically tonight,” Ferguson said. “Usually we want to average about three per set, but we beat that mark by a wide margin.”
The total team effort was highlighted by the seniors, especially McKibbin. In the third set, McKibbin emerged with some timely, quick surprise kills. The captain managed to win a couple of jousts against taller defenders, while still setting USC’s big hitters with precision. McKibbin finished the night with four kills, 35 assists, and an ace.
“Riley was unreal,” Ferguson said. “He ran a great offense, kept a couple of plays alive, and really led us through some tough sets.”

$60 million might sound like a lot. With that much in capital, you could buy two dozen Coachella tickets, three or four Boeing 737s and a five-star Caribbean resort (at least by my calculations).
But in the world of college football television contracts, the soon-to-be Pac-12’s $60 million in annual earnings is at the bottom of the barrel, making it, for all intents and purposes, a serf when it comes to TV revenue.
By comparison, the Big Ten reigns as king.
This year, the 11-member league produced $220 million in revenue — nearly four times as much as the Pac-10. Similarly, the SEC generated upward of $205 million.
But for the Pac-12, there is now an opportunity to alter that startling trend, as the conference’s current TV deal is set to expire after the 2011 season.
“I’ve felt all along that college sports is undervalued,” conference commissioner Larry Scott said last May, when asked about a potential new television contract. “And I think the Pac-10 is more undervalued than any conference.”
With Scott in the midst of negotiations with potential suitors, a new deal is imminent, expected to be reached at some point this summer.
Fortunately for Scott, if recent news surrounding the Big XII serves as any indication, a few more Benjamins are headed west.
If Big XII commissioner Dan Beebe can do it, frankly, anybody can.
Under the Big XII’s new deal, reached last Wednesday, the conference will receive an estimated $90 million annually from Fox Sports as part of a 13-year agreement for the conference’s broadcasting rights. And that’s just for cable.
“It is helpful to see such a significant increase in Big 12 rights,” Scott said through a spokesman Friday.
The Big XII also has a deal in place with ABC/ESPN worth roughly $40 million per season that runs through the 2015-2016 season. By the time the deal expires, the league and its members will have received more than $1 billion in revenue.
Still think $60 million is a lot?
Oddly enough, the popularity of DVRs and the online streaming of television programs on websites such as Hulu have made sports broadcasting rights all the more sought after these days.
Sports is the only type of programming that has been, and by all indications will continue to be, televised live. In short, commercials and advertisers still matter when it comes to sports programming, and as a result, TV contracts across all professional leagues and college athletic conferences have stayed lucrative in the past year.
According to the Sports Business Journal, the NHL is expected to sign a record media rights deal in the coming months, worth more than $200 million annually. And in January, ESPN and the University of Texas agreed to a 20-year, $300 million contract to launch a 24-hour television network to broadcast various Texas athletic contests.
That ain’t chump change.
Considering the recent trend, Scott has a fantastic opportunity to capitalize on the current climate by reaching his own sweetheart deal for the Pac-12.
As outlined by the Wall Street Journal on Saturday, the conference is seeking a deal worth $2.3 billion over 10 years, which would be worth four times as much annually as its current deal. It would also stipulate a commitment to launch a Pac-12 regional sports network akin to Fox’s Big Ten Network.
Though ESPN and Fox are considered to be in the mix for a potential deal, Comcast/NBC Universal remains the wild card, potentially making for an even bigger pay day for USC and the conference’s 11 other institutions.
In the last few weeks, it has been widely speculated by several media outlets that new NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke remains interested in forming a rival to ESPN, despite failed attempts to do so with Comcast’s Versus sports network.
But regardless of the network’s success, or lack thereof, in turning Versus into a viable competitor, NBC has dipped into its pockets for sports programming in the past, as seen with the Olympics.
It has lost money, but it has been willing to splurge.
And with the Pac-12 being the only major BCS conference outside of the Big East scheduled to renegotiate its TV rights deal before 2016, this could be the last great opportunity for Burke to make a splash in the world of college sports.
Regardless of Burke’s final decision, however, expect Scott’s negotiations to result in plenty of green lining the pacific coast.

On a sweltering Saturday at the Coliseum, the defense once again asserted itself, scrimmaging against a depleted offensive line and running back corps.
Missing · The offense struggled mightily without senior tight end Rhett Ellison, who sat out Saturday’s scrimmage because of an injury. - Daily Trojan file photo 
USC’s defensive front seven, which features none of next fall’s projected starters at linebacker next fall and is without talented defensive end Armond Armstead and defensive tackle Christian Tupou, continued to make plays.
As the scrimmage progressed, junior quarterback Matt Barkley became visibly frustrated with his offensive line’s inability to prevent the defensive linemen from raising their hands in the passing lanes.
Seven penalties were called against the offense during the scrimmage, compared to only one against the defense.
Much of the offense’s inconsistent play was attributed to the absence of senior tight end Rhett Ellison, who is normally called upon to motion before a snap.
In Ellison’s place, USC used freshman fullback Soma Vainuku and sophomore tight end Christian Thomas.
The only explosive play through the air Saturday was a 40-yard pass from freshman quarterback Cody Kessler to sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods. The play was negated, however, because the coaches determined Kessler would have been sacked if the defense was allowed to hit the quarterback.
“I thought the defense came out flying all over the place, great mentality about themselves,” Kiffin said. “It was very good to see the offense help them by not playing all that well.”
Kiffin said he was upset with the freshmen offensive players’ effort, though he would not identify specific players.
He said he was glad that their low-energy effort happened now, when he can correct it, rather than during the season.
 
u
 
One player who has made a name for himself, however, is redshirt freshman Hayes Pullard. After a nondescript first season for the Trojans as a practice squad player, Kiffin continues to tout Pullard as a player who will figure heavily into the linebacker rotation next fall, perhaps even having an outside chance to start.
“[Hayes Pullard] is a guy who would not be getting as many reps necessarily with all of the other guys healthy,” Kiffin said. “He is a good example of [someone who is stepping up].”

Oregon second baseman Danny Pulfer was white hot.
With eight consecutive hits, he was killing USC. Two of those hits had been against Sunday’s starting pitcher, senior Logan Odom. So when he came to the plate with the bases loaded in the fifth inning Sunday, the coaching staff gave starting pitcher Logan Odom free reign to stray from the scouting report.
Strong performance · Senior pitcher Logan Odom lasted seven and two-thirds innings, striking out five and allowing one earned run in leading USC to a 3-1 victory over Oregon. The Trojans have now won four of their last five contests in Pac-10 play. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
“I just wanted to get him out with the slider,” Odom said. “I went with the scouting report and game plan earlier in the game and he had two hits. I got him out with sliders all summer, so I wanted to make him beat me with that pitch.”
Odom used his three-quarters fastball and a bevy of sliders, including the two-strike slider Pulfer feebly whiffed on as he struck out. Odom then got a groundball to end the inning — and Oregon’s threat.
“[Odom] stepped up,” said USC interim head coach Frank Cruz. “That was huge. That was their big rally. We would want to have Odom on the mound as much as anybody in that type of situation. We know he’ll give us everything he has.”
The Trojans (15-20, 6-6) took the series against Oregon (17-16, 2-7) with a 3-1 victory Sunday afternoon at Dedeaux Field, scoring a pair of runs in their final at bat.
After senior second baseman Joe De Pinto led off with a walk and advanced to third on a balk and a wild pitch, junior outfielder Alex Sherrod smashed a RBI-double down the right field line. Sherrod scored two batters later on a Brandon Garcia sacrifice fly.
Junior Chad Smith picked up the win after coming in during the eighth inning and striking out first baseman Shawn Peterson to end the inning. Unfortunately, Smith left the game with numbness in his pitching elbow. The extent of the injury is not known, though he is supposed to be re-evaluated today.
Junior Ben Mount came on and got the final two outs to close the game out for his first career save.
“That’s a real tough situation, but Mount has had a really strong week,” Cruz said. “He’s getting the ball down and he has a lot of confidence.”
The Ducks took the lead in the third inning when Pulfer singled home shortstop KC Serna, but the Trojans responded in the fourth inning.
De Pinto lined a shot into the right-centerfield gap that looked like it was going to be a spectacular out when Oregon right fielder Aaron Jones made a leaping attempt. But the ball bounded off his glove and went to the wall, giving De Pinto a stand-up triple. Two batters later, a Matt Foat sacrifice fly tied the game.
“Honestly, it’s awesome for these guys. We’ve been battling all season,” Cruz said. “This time they came through and were able to get it done. We’ve been talking about physical and mental toughness and we’re hoping that they’re finally getting it.”
Oregon took the first game of the series 4-2 thanks to a marvelous pitching performance from Tyler Anderson. The junior lefty threw eight and one-third innings, allowing only five hits and two unearned runs. Anderson used a four-pitch mix to strikeout 10 batters, including Oropesa three times.
USC junior starting pitcher Andrew Triggs was nearly as good, going six and two-thirds innings. He allowed only six hits and two runs while tying his career high with nine strikeouts.
In the eighth inning, however, Oregon’s Stefan Sabol hit a line shot over the fence just inside the left field foul pole to break a 2-2 tie. The Ducks added an insurance run in the ninth and closer Kellen Moen closed the door for his sixth save of the year.
USC bounced back to take the middle game of the series, 9-2.
Junior starting pitcher Austin Wood picked up his third win of the season, pitching six and one-third solid innings. After Wood departed in the seventh inning, his streak of 15 and one-third innings without allowing an earned run, dating back a week and a half, ended when one of Wood’s runners scored on Mount.
Taking a 3-1 lead into the eighth inning, the Trojans put the game away with six runs against four Oregon relievers. USC scored the six runs on only two hits. Sophomore pinch hitter Shane Boras collected his first hit of the season and first career RBI with a single, and freshman James Roberts lined a two-RBI single up the middle.
Roberts finished the game with his first career three-hit game and a career-high three RBI. Sherrod also added three hits Saturday.

Sidney Harman, a professor and entrepreneur known for his unyielding dedication to students, died Tuesday from complications of acute myeloid leukemia. He was 92.
Remembered · Sidney Harman, the founding chairman of USC’s Academy for Polymathic Study, died Tuesday of acute myeloid leukemia. - Photo courtesy of University Communications  
Harman was appointed Presidential Professor and inaugural Isaias W. Hellman Professor of Polymathy at USC in 2010, a designation that reflects his commitment to varied, interdisciplinary learning. He was a founding chairman of USC’s Academy for Polymathic Study, which fosters the pursuit of interdisciplinary work.
But he was perhaps better known for his entrepreneurial endeavors, including his acquisition of Newsweek magazine for $1 last year.
Harman was also a public servant, philanthropist and audio equipment mogul — he founded Harman International Industries, a stereo maker now based out of Washington, in 1953.
“He was so accessible and had a true passion for the student body,” said Karin Huebner, director of programs at the Academy for Polymathic Study. “He encouraged students to pursue their academic passions because it can lead to something great — and I witnessed that firsthand.”
Huebner said even when Harman did not feel well later in life, he still invited students to talk to him and email him if they had any problems. At one Academy for Polymathic Study meeting, Harman took the time to talk to each of the 43 students that attended.
“The first thing he did was ask each student what his field of study was,” Huebner said. “He didn’t talk about himself … that left an impression.”
Harman believed by bridging different disciplines, from art to science, unparalleled results could be seen — results crucial to the formulation of new ideas and theories.
“[Harman] remained fully committed to helping our students develop expertise that integrates the very best of several disciplines,” President C. L. Max Nikias wrote in a letter. “He touched so many with the breadth of his knowledge, the scope of his intellect and the depth of his experiences. He was a genius.”
In Washington, D.C., Harman used his genius — and his audio fortune, estimated at $500 million — to give back to the community. He funded the building of the Sidney Harman Hall, home to the Shakespeare Theater Company and the Washington Ballet, and also started the Harman Family Foundation, an organization that benefits the arts.
“Few people command the broad perspective that Dr. Harman brought to bear in all his successful endeavors,” wrote Catherine Quinlan, dean of the USC Libraries, in a letter.
Harman served as a guest lecturer for a number of classes, including those in architecture, economics and law.
“He was so much older than the students, but he was so calm in his demeanor and very wise in the words he gave them, that they all showed a great amount of respect for him,” said James Ellis, dean of the Marshall School of Business. “He was a pretty amazing fellow.”
Harman’s impact is evident university-wide; the Academy of Polymathic Study now includes 186 members and those who worked closely with Harman recognize him as a visionary individual.
“On a personal note, I will miss him very deeply, and will fondly recall the many thought-provoking conversations we shared in my office,” Nikias wrote. “I know the USC community joins me in extending heartfelt sympathies to Jane and the entire Harman family.”
Harman is survived by his wife, former congresswoman Jane Harman, six children and two step-children.
Private services will be held in both Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles at later dates, according to his family.

Members of the Military Acceptance Project, an organization started by graduate students from the USC School of Social Work, launched a website earlier this month to educate service members about the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell.”
The site features articles, training materials and other sources of information designed to give information and support to all military members in light of the repeal of don’t ask, don’t tell, the policy that prohibited lesbian, gay or bisexual service members from, discussing their sexual orientation. The bill to repeal the policy was passed in 2010.
The Military Acceptance Project provides links and information to services that offer help and support LGB service members.
MAP was co-founded by Kristen Kavanaugh, a former Marine Corps captain and graduate of the United States Naval Academy. Kavanaugh, a first-year graduate student working toward a master’s degree in social work, said she got the idea to create the organization after she began her studies at USC in January.
“My social welfare class was given an assignment to advocate for an oppressed or marginalized population,” Kavanaugh said. “The implementation of the repeal of don’t ask, don’t tell was on my mind, and I suggested that we advocate for lesbian, gay and bisexual service members affected by the passage of the repeal.”
Jasper Kump, a public relations associate from the MAP, said the organizations’ central mission is to encourage others to be more accepting of all former, current and future service members, especially those who have been marginalized for any reason.
Currently, MAP is focusing solely on issues relating to the LGB community, but will seek to expand the issues they cover in the future.
Kump said the effects of DADT have long been felt by LGB service members. The MAP combines its members’ passions for the military and helping others into one organization that seeks to better understand how we can help the LGB community.
“It is our hope that the website will not only provide information regarding the repeal of don’t ask, don’t tell, but will also serve as a catalyst to help educate, enlighten, and empower all members of the military to treat each other with understanding, respect, and equality,” Kump said.
Jane Allgood, a clinical associate professor of social work who oversaw the project from its inception, said MAP has already had an immediate impact on the USC community.
“[The MAP] further demonstrates how USC is on the forefront in providing social work services to the military,” Allgood said. “The School of Social Work is the first in the country to have a true focus on military social work, and to have the structure we do for research on the military and their families.”
The reaction to the MAP so far has been positive, according to Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh has also received encouraging feedback from both the LGB and the straight communities, as well as both military members and civilians.
Kump said the organization has faced very few challenges in its early stages.
“We’ve been pleasantly surprised by how many people are not only supportive but also excited about the work we’re beginning,” Kavanaugh said. “The Department of Defense as well as branches of the military were all interested, and cooperated with us in sourcing information for the site, providing us with training materials, and serving as a contact for anonymous feedback from LGB service members.”
Nick Borrelli, a first-year graduate student in social work who also works with the MAP, said he has seen many people, not just at USC but around southern California, request additional information about DADT’s repeal and its significance for the LGB community.
“I’ve had so many classmates interning at the Department of Veteran Affairs in San Diego asking them to pass on this knowledge,” Borrelli said. “They have clients asking them questions directly related to what we’re working on, and these resources that we have would be amazing for them.”
The MAP hopes to aid LGB service members for many years to come, even after Kavanaugh and her fellow students receive their degrees from USC.
“Our team understands that the project does not end at the close of the semester, but is committed to continuing the project until there is no longer a need for it,” Allgood said.
Alex’s needless worrying all stems from his religious-like belief in 3 obsolete assumptions.
Firstly, Alex worries — incorrectly — that DADT can’t be repealed because of his notion of a “gay lifestyle choice.”
That notion was never true, and was discredited when it first arose decades ago.
There is no such thing as a “gay lifestyle choice” any more than there is such a thing as a “heterosexual lifestyle choice.”  Trying to write a usable definition for either one quickly shows that (a) sexual orientation by itself never constitutes a “lifestyle” (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or asexual), and (b) sexual orientations aren’t “choices” that people flip like light switches.  Today’s typical new recruits have shown that they already know this.
Secondly, Alex also worries — again, incorrectly — that DADT can’t be repealed because of his notion that opposite-sex relations are safe but same-sex relations are dangerous.
That notion was never true, and was discredited when it first arose decades ago.
When it comes to sexually transmitted diseases via activity among the over-21 crowd in the 21st century, virtually all such relations incur risk, because whenever Person A has sex with Person B, both are also — in effect — having sex with every partner that the other person ever had.  This is true for everyone, regardless of past or present sexual orientation(s).  But the armed forces Surgeons General already confirmed that:  (a) military personnel are safe, (b) the military blood supply is safe, (c) DADT repeal doesn’t hinder deployability, and (d) DADT repeal doesn’t change the prevalence of STDs.  The commanders who are leading the DADT repeal classes encourage all personnel with worries such as Alex’s to speak up so that all their unfounded fears can be put to rest for once and for all.
Thirdly, Alex also worries — again, incorrectly — that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control STD statistics for the civilian world are the same as the statistics for the military world.
They are not.
Because of the unique environment of the military, the armed forces Surgeons General reported last November that:
(1) The personnel, blood supply, deployability, and STD prevalence are already safe now.
(2) The 65,752 bisexual, lesbian, and gay personnel haven’t and won’t hinder that safety.
and
(3) Those safety levels will not change because of DADT repeal.
Curiously, Alex admits that he is not in the military, and admits that he has no contact with the all-male units about which he is so deeply worried.  Alex could close the great gulf between his knowledge and his fears by first reviewing the 747 pages of DoD materials itemized here yesterday, and then reviewing the 214 pages of branch-specific training materials.  All these documents are public records and have been available for months.
Finally, Alex claims — incorrectly — that his own worries trump the attitudes publicly expressed by Marine combat units to their commanders and to the world at large, and claims that whatever Marines promised their commanders “easily went out the window.”   Not only are his concerns trumped up and ridiculous, but his accusation that the Corps already reneged upon its public promises insults every Marine who participated in making those commitments.
Alex should put all his lingering fears on ice, and just mark his calendar for 31 May, when the U.S. Marine Corps is scheduled to announce that DADT repeal training got completed — with no harm to cohesion, morale, readiness, or effectiveness — before each of the other 4 military service branches.
Ned,
I appreciate your whole hearted passion in this issue.  The fact that you are so unconfused about a subject at whose very core is often characterized by “confusion” is very revealing.
OK…where do I begin…
1.  I will say that I am in position that I can say anything I want about military policy.  I am also in a position to know much more about the attitudes, beliefs, and culture of the units I am refering to than the average civilian.  My opinions are not pulled out of thin air but based on FACTUAL knowledge of the current attitudes that exist in the nation’s ELITE units.  
2.  Your Marine Corps statistics are great.  They are not elite units, however, not by my metrics.  I am also aware of the Commendants 180 and his report to Congress.  I am also aware that his report (whether pro DADT repeal or anti DADT repeal) will DIRECTLY effect the rest of his career and will be a MAJOR determining factor if he ever has sights as the CJCOS.  All the top Generals are political players…and their opinions about this policy ARE NOT REFLECTIVE of the real military!!!  I REPEAT…the opinions of the top generals on this matter ARE NOT REFLECTIVE of the real military.  You have to go to about O5 and below to find the true beliefs.  In the ELITE units, there is heavy resistance to the DADT repeal.
3.  It’s not a choice? OK…so why do surveys say that 6% of the population has had a gay experience, and then only 1-2% of the population practices gay sex regularly.  So they chose one way while they were confused and figuring things out.  Then they chose another way once the idea of destroying their family honor kicked in.
4.  I never said the STD’s will increase in the military.  I only said that they had a chance to increase, based on CDC data which is FACT.  The gay lifestyle IS MORE DANGEROUS.  Yes, all sexual contact carries risk, thanks Captain obvious.  HOWEVER, based on the CDC…unbiased…OBAMA LED ORGANIZATION…..the catagory of MEN who  have sex with MEN are 44 times more likely to have HIV….44 times… 
and in younger age catagories… the increase in HIV rates went up 12% recently.  Interesting that in recent years the gay lifestyle is MORE accepted and kids today think it is perfectly safe.  This may be a contributing factor to the INCREASE in HIV amongst younger gay men.
In fact….in this one age segment, it is predicted based on FACT by the CDC that at current rates of increase, by the time this age segment reaches 40, that 40% of all gay men will have HIV….
Now, I am not a disease expert.  But as a matter of common sense, it would seem that the behavior of gay sex, which on average means you will have over 500 partners in a lifetime, is a very risky, a very dangerous, and a very deadly lifestyle decision.  
It’s to the point where you almost want to LAUGH at gay people with AIDS…because its like, how could you be so dumb…did you really think that misusing this orifice would be healthy?
4.  I have heard through the grapevine about the training material.  I agree with you on almost all these issues.  For the regular military folks, this radical policy shift forced upon the military will be fine.
You have done NOTHING….NOTHING to refute my main claim, however…because you lack the knowledge to argue about ELITE Special Operations units.  These units will be more resistant of the gay lifestyle because it currently is so far away from the culture, that it will take years to change.  Not saying it won’t happen.  My point is that currently, these units are made up of good ole boys with conservative values.  Period.  The end.
BTW…I am not religious, but base my opinions on CDC facts about behavior, biology, and a FIRM belief in Darwinian evolution and survival of the fittest.
FACT:  Gay men are evolutionary FAILURES, are UNFIT for reproduction, and have chosen to take their DNA out of the gene pool.  Therefore, based on Darwin, not religion, they have dishonored not just their parents, but the entire genetic line going back millions, even billions of years.  The most important role of humanity is the future of humanity.  If you fail to care about the future of humanity for the feeling of 5 seconds of narcotic release that you chase with a lifestyle, you have FAILED your duties as a man.  This opinion is based on Darwin.  
FACT.  Gay men are less than real men who make decisions about the future of humanity, instead of making decisions about how he will engage in wanton narcotic releases that he knows is a misuse of his organs.
Notice how Alex ignores the CDC’s information about internalized homophobia and lack of social structure contributing to risky behaviors such as not using condoms.  This jerk keeps spouting off about how dangerous the “gay lifestyle” is, whatever that is.  But does he support the freedom to marry, the one social structure that promotes monogamy and therefore little to no risk?  HELL NO he doesn’t.  People like Alex don’t want you know that states like Massachusets have the lowest instances of divorce, unwed pregnancies and STDs.  While anti-gay states like Mississippi, Alabama and North Caralina have the highest. I’ve seen it even here in little old St Robert, MO, population 2,700. There’s a Baptist church on every street corner, yet we have one of the biggest Red Light Districts per capita, including an Adult Video Bookstore full of mostly married men, sneeking off after work to jerk off, so their wives won’t catch them with their pants down at the computer. Why is it that the most conservative anti-gay “Christians” amoug us also can’t get their act together, hmmmmm??
Alex makes the ridiculous assumption that DADT is repeal is all about “letting in” gay people to the military. It’s not. Gay people have been allowed to join since DADT was signed in 1996… There’s thousands of them in the military right now. They were just banned from talking about it or disclosing their orientation to military comrades or superiors. I know it may throw a lot of your preconceived notions about the so-called “gay lifestyle” in the trash heap of ignorance, but it’s possible to be gay and not act like a feminine hairdresser. Also, the same rules of behavior govern all soldiers, nothing there changed. You still cant sleep around, or be disrespectful, or engage in sloppy PDA, or flirt with superiors, whether they are opposite or same sex. Today’s gay soldiers, and those who join after DADT repeal is implemented, will blend in to the military almost unnoticeably. Finally, I’m not a sailor or airman, but I’m sure they would probably kick your ass if you looked at them and said they had “soft skills”. Flying a joint strike fighter jet is actually a lot more demanding than Alex’s Xbox might make him believe.
Reed,
1.  What you said is correct.  There are many gay soldiers serving in the military.  There are even gay soldiers serving in “combat arms” as opposed to “soft skills”.  There are not many gay soldiers serving in elite special operations units.  FACT.
2.  I agree that they will blend in almost unnoticeably in the regular forces.  But my point wasn’t about the regular Army, the regular Marines, the Air Force slobs, or the Navy folks who run ships and fly planes.  My point was about the units where the character trait “machismo” is off the charts and is mostly (90%) filled with very conservative members.  The elite units are nothing like the regular military.  However, the fact that they are more mature and more intelligent may make it easier for them to adjust to changes, I will concede.  However, they are the MOST intelligent, and the MOST socially and politically conservative.
3.  On your last point…ahhh…I think that you think because I said I am not CURRENTLY in any of these units that I just play XBOX 360…in fact, my opinions are extrapolated based on experience and FACT.  Concerning sailors and airmen, it depends on the unit.  They do have some elite units…and most sailor and airmen elite units are EXTREMELY conservative.  However, I will say that airmen are ALWAYS in a position of support on elite missions.
Thanks, Ned, for the facts. “Alex” can’t even spell correctly. It’s no surprise that his beliefs about the “gay lifestyle choice” and military service are so erroneous. At least he’s consistent.
To clarify:  I think the gay lifestyle choice could gain acceptance into certain conservative units after some time.
I am just saying that the lifestyle is not currently part of the culture.  It’s not like you can just pass a law and BOOM, everyone who was raised with Christian values automatically thinks the choice of gay behavior is perfectly safe, when they have been told otherwise their entire lives.
If you could showcase some statistics that show the gay lifestyle as being perfectly safe from an STD perspective, you might be able to change some minds.  However, I don’t know that any such data exists.  In fact, I believe most of the data from unbiased sources all indicates that gay behavior is EXTREMELY HIGH RISK.   I believe the US government data on HIV all indicate that Men who have sex with Men is the largest single determinant of whether someone will get HIV in their lifetime.  A higher risk factor than say, introvenous drug use.  Recent data suggests that at current INCREASING rates of infection, in 20 years, it is predicted that 40% of gay men in certain age segments will be infected with HIV.  Again, this is all data from CDC.gov’s website.  Totally unbiased government research.
So the information sharing to service members about gay behavior will be difficult as the data will have to be presented factually.  Unless there plans on government wide whitewashing of CDC statistics on gay behavior, something that is already happening in public education.
Just sayin…stats don’t lie.
Disclaimer:  I am not in the military and have no contact with these units.
“Alex” is unfamiliar with the current military culture, last year’s DoD survey results, and the DADT repeal law provisions.  His assumptions are wrong — on 4 counts.
Firstly, “Alex” wrote — incorrectly — that “the gay culture is not accepted in the infantry Army, Marines, and in Special Operations.”
That is untrue.
The active and reserve armed forces already have 65,752 gay/lesbian/bisexual members today, and the 2.2 million military personnel (97% heterosexual, by the way) already shouted loud and clear that they support DADT repeal.  The DoD’s 266-page report (30 November 2010) noted:
■ 159,318 responders said that most military personnel and spouses want DADT repealed.
■ The 30% who had negative views about repeal were the same 30% who believed that they had never worked near a homosexual/bisexual colleague.  But they were wrong.
■ 70% of all personnel said that gay/lesbian colleagues would have a “positive, mixed, or no effect” on their unit’s ability to work together.
■ 69% said they had already worked in their unit alongside a co-worker they believed was gay/lesbian.
■ 92% said their actual experience working with gay/lesbian co-workers in their unit was “very
good,” “good,” or “neither good nor poor.”
■ 92% of today’s average (20-year-old) recruits, as soon as they get to actually serve alongside fellow soldiers who are gay, are perfectly OK with it.
And although 23% of Marines threatened to resign over DADT repeal one year ago, today that number is zero.  Commandant General James Amos addressed 12,000 Marines in late December, 2010, and on 18 February 2011 he reported that, “everyone said, ‘Sir, we got it.  We’re going to do this thing’” and Amos later confirmed that he’s had no indication he will lose any personnel at all.  Moreover, across all branches, recruiting and retention goals are being met, with zero resignations.
Sources:
■ DADT Repeal Comprehensive Review & Findings (DoD, 30 November 2010, 431 pages)
■ Support Plan for Implementation (DoD, 30 November 2010, 95 pages)
■ DADT Repeal Policy (Undersecretary of Defense Clifford Stanley, 28 January 2011, 7 pages)
■ Branch-Specific Training Materials (DoD, February/March 2011, 214 pages)  
Secondly, “Alex” also wrote — again, incorrectly — that “it is highly unlikely that gay service members will serve in the nation’s most elite units . . . at the highest levels, no way in hell they are getting in.”
That also is untrue.
Bisexual, lesbian, and gay members of the armed forces have always served in all branches, in all units, at all levels, on active duty and ready reserve.  They’re already there; they’ve always been there.  The only people who still think that bisexuals, lesbians, and gays don’t even exist are the people who are so homophobic that no one confides in them what everyone else already knows.
Thirdly, “Alex” also wrote — again, incorrectly — that “Legislation will not change the attitudes of these largely good ole boys clubs” because “the selection process is purely subjective and most of the standards are up to the gatekeepers making the selections.”
Both assumptions are untrue.
By federal law passed 22 December 2010, and new policies announced 28 January 2011:  (1) all armed forces members will be judged solely on merit, fitness, and capability; (2) sexual orientation will never be asked, recorded, or saved; and (3) sexual orientation will never be a factor in recruiting, enlistment, training, assignment, promotion, discharge, retirement, or veteran benefits.  Personnel decisions are no longer “purely subjective” or “up to the gatekeepers” and are, in fact, totally objective, and set by worldwide personnel standards.  Anyone failing to comply is in violation of a direct order, and subject to administrative or legal action, up to and including discharge.
Fourth, “Alex” also wrote — again, incorrectly — that accepting gay enlistees “is a HIGH RISK HIV factor that will not be acceptable.”
That also is untrue.
Since 1993, the medical community has made significant advances in understanding, treatment, and prevention of HIV.  Every Service member is tested for HIV at least every two years, and all Service members are tested before and after deployment, and on the advice of a doctor, and upon request.  Positive HIV test results preclude enlistment, and re-classify active duty personnel as non-deployable.  In addition, the Services Surgeons General already confirmed that the medical community procedures to prevent the spread of HIV and to secure the blood supply of the Military Services are sufficient, and that a repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell will have no adverse impact to deployability.  For all these reasons, DoD confirmed in November 2010 that repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell will cause no significant change in overall HIV prevalence in the military.
Ned,
Quick rebuttel…
I am referring only to all male war fighting units that typically contain conservative service members.  The study you site lumps together war fighters and soft skills. My opinions are not directed at soft skilled units.  
The statistic about Marine Corps going from 23% in an anonymous study to 0% in real life is invalid.  When the reality of paying bills set in, the principles easily went out the window.  Also your claim says more about military discipline than changing opinion.
I have no doubt that professionals in all the branches of the Armed Service will follow the law during the selection of members into their units.  However, the notion that the openly gay culture will be accepted with open arms at the drop of the hat is really a stretch in units that have not typically accepted this alternative lifestyle is a stretch.  The transition in culture will not happen over night.
As far as HIV…I am talking about the high risk factors that already exist amongst the MSM population according to the CDC.  Yes, military testing will eliminate much of the risk.  However, the psychological stigma attached to CDC facts will be hard to overcome.  The fact remains, gay sex is high risk, even for those who are screened more often.  The gay community has extremely high standards for screening and they still have record rates of infection. Increased screening rates does not eliminate the dangers of the high risk behavior.
Interesting initiative.  I think that the repeal of DADT will be fine in the Navy, Air Force, and in the regular Army in areas that contain soft-skills.
However, in the infantry Army, Marines, and in Special Operations, the gay culture is not accepted.  Legislation will not change the attitudes of these largely good ole boys clubs.
In Special Operations, the selection process is purely subjective and most of the standards are up to the gatekeepers making the selections.  I doubt DC legislation will have any impact.  Sure, in writing they will say they have to accept gay applicants, but the reality is that these units are really just clubs of elite men where you have to fit in to get in.  Trust me, the gay lifestyle is not part of the culture.
Additionally, some Special Operations units may assess the risk in hiring gay applicants since the CDC has published statistics that show gay men are 44 times more likely to have HIV, and that depending on city of origin, gay men could have a 20-30% HIV rate.  This is a HIGH RISK factor that will not be acceptable in a process that works to eliminate risk out of candidates for these units.  The statistical risk factors are hard to deny when bloodshed and transmission amongst team members is highly probable.
The fact of the matter is that it is highly unlikely that gay service members will serve in the nation’s most elite units.  The lower level Special Operations will accept them…but at the highest levels, no way in hell they are getting in.
IOW, the tough guys doing all the cool stuff that Call of Duty is based on, will continue to be tough guys.  There will never be anything “fabulous” about them.

The Interfraternity and Panhellenic Councils will host a Comedy Fundraiser tonight that intends to unite Greeks and non-Greeks in raising awareness about sexual violence and assault.
The Women’s Student Assembly and The Clothesline Project will co-sponsor the event, which will be held from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at Tommy’s Place.
Though the event is free for students, there will be a $10 suggested donation  and proceeds will be given to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, the nation’s largest anti-sexual assault organization.
Zack Jerome, a USC alum and creator of the Lost Angeles blog, and comedians Jonny Loquasto, Yassir Lester, Lauren Ashley Bishop and Adam Devine will be among the night’s performers.
IFC President Pat Lauer said IFC wanted to have an event that would be noticed outside of the Greek community before everyone leaves for summer. Lauer also said IFC and PHC wanted to host an event where the focus was not on alcohol, but on benefitting an important group of people.
As planning began only a week and a half ago, IFC collaborated with USC administrators to secure a venue on short notice.
“When we reached out to the Office of Student Affairs and laid out our entire plan, they were extremely supportive and were instrumental in hooking us up with the best social hub on campus,” Lauer said.
Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson said IFC had not used their free rental for the year, so they will only have to pay for direct costs and staffing for the event, and not the rental fee for Tommy’s Place.
Jackson said he supports IFC’s effort to raise awareness and money through the comedy fundraiser.
Some students also believe the comedy fundraiser is a good way to spread information on the prevalence of sexual violence.
“Any event that invites people to sit in the same room and unite for the same cause will stimulate discussion on a topic that needs to be thought about,” said Lauren Wendlberger, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering. “Comedy won’t make the situation any less serious, but the problems we’re facing can’t be fixed overnight.”
Other students like Anisha Veer, a freshman majoring in business administration, do not plan to attend the event.
“I don’t think you can address this serious issue by a silly comedy show,” she said. “I also doubt the motives of IFC and believe that they are doing it for show to better Greeks’ tarnished reputation and because of pressure from the university.”
Despite such feelings from some of the campus community, Lauer maintains the event is not merely a defensive action to prove wrong students who label Greeks as sexist or misogynist.
Lauer believes the recent scandals in USC’s Greek community have put Greeks in the spotlight, and he thinks an event like the comedy fundraiser is necessary to show steps are being taken to move forward from these negative events.
“Due to the recent national scandals, the eyes of the school and of the nation are unfortunately on us,” Lauer said. “We had a huge Greek presence at Take Back the Night, but what we needed was to make a bigger gesture, one that would be noticed outside of the Greek community alone.”
Lauer notes, however, the fundraiser is not just a response to the recent scandals.
“These recent scandals have brought to light issues concerning gender awareness and sexual assault that have gone unnoticed for too long in our entire USC community,” he said. “It is this longstanding issue that we are responding to.
Pedro Moura, IFC vice president of public relations, said IFC and PHC hope to create a USC program or group in the near future called “Greeks Against Sexual Assault” in an effort to show that greeks do not support sexual violence. The program is currently in its early stages of development.
Donations can also be made via Greeks Against Sexual Assault Eventbrite page online.

Playing in what will likely be her last match at Marks Stadium, senior Maria Sanchez punctuated a stellar season with an impressive 6-1, 6-3 victory over UCLA’s McCall Jones.
Despite Sanchez’s victory, the Women of Troy (15-6, 4-4) still fell to the Bruins in a tight 5-2 contest Friday afternoon.
Led by senior Noelle Hickey, UCLA (18-5, 7-1) took control of the doubles’ point early on, followed by Hickey’s singles win over sophomore Danielle Lao, 6-2, 6-0.
The No. 21-ranked Lao struggled throughout the day, losing both of her matches in quick fashion.
On court three, Lao and senior Lyndsey Kinstler fell to the Bruins’ doubles Pamela Montez and Maya Johansson, 8-5, in what would be the deciding match between the two teams.
Staying in doubles’ play, the No. 5 pair of Sanchez and freshman Kaitlyn Christian ended the season on a five-match winning streak, taking down UCLA’s Courtney Dolehide and Andrea Remnyse, 8-3.
In the third-slotted singles match, Christian continued her winning ways, dispatching the No. 62-ranked Remynse in straight sets 6-3, 3-0 after Remynse retired with an injury midway through the second set.
UCLA went on to sweep through the bottom half of the singles’ bracket, highlighted by Montez’s 6-2, 6-4 win against junior Alison Ramos. Following Montez’ victory, UCLA’s Johansson took down sophomore Valeria Pulido 7-3, 6-3 on court four, and then in the day’s final match senior Cristala Andrews was beaten by Carling Seguso 6-2, 1-6, 6-2.
“Give UCLA credit, they played very well, having said that we didn’t play our best by a long shot,” Gallien said. “We are going to be healthy for the NCAA tourney and give it our best shot.”
Before USC heads to the NCAA tournament, though, they will have to get through the Pac-10 tourney.
Despite their performance in Pac-10 play, coach Gallien has a tremendous amount of confidence and faith in his group.
“I believe we still have a run in us,” he said.

Rio hit theaters this weekend, bringing to the screen a family-friendly, colorful romp that is entertaining, despite the formulaic plot.
Though it certainly isn’t a Pixar movie — the comparison is impossible not to make — Rio charms the audience with likeable characters and a general lightheartedness. 
The story centers on Blu (Jesse Eisenberg), a blue macaw living with his human friend and owner Linda (Leslie Mann), a bookshop owner in Minnesota.
Blu’s safe and comfortable life is ruffled when a Brazilian scientist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) comes to the bookshop and informs Linda that Blu is the last male of his kind and he wants Blu to mate with the last female of its kind, Jewel (Anne Hathaway).
Blu and Linda soon travel to Rio to find Jewel, and it quickly becomes apparent Blu and Jewel absolutely can’t stand each other. Yet they are forced to work together when they are kidnapped by precious bird smugglers.
There are a number of interesting characters, most of which have been rendered utterly adorable by the animation. They aren’t incredibly deep, but they’re diverse and kooky enough to satisfy.
Blu, who never learned how to fly, is an instantly sympathetic and loveable lead.
He’s socially awkward, bookish and a bit defensive, but his awkwardness is charming and Eisenberg’s voice successfully brings the character to life.
Jewel is a fiery, take-charge type, who is wise from her life experiences, unlike Blu, who spent most of his life drinking cocoa inside a cozy bookshop.
The villains do their part, but they’re more funny than scary. Nigel (Jemaine Clement), a sulfur-crested Cockatoo henchman, is more evil than the human villains, who are simply out to get rich. Nigel has fun being evil and he’s both charismatic and sinister, which makes him highly enjoyable to watch.
The other characters help move the plot along in a fun way, but far too many of them seem to be there just to provide comedic relief.
The plot itself is pretty formulaic and  it would have benefited from additional solid jokes, which are scarce, instead of relying on certain characters to create a goofy atmosphere.
The music in Rio is a mixed bag. Although there’s some catchy samba, the music is gratuitous and a bit unnecessary. The opening number, with its largely uninteresting lyrics about Rio and perfectly choreographed dancing birds, could have been scrapped completely.
There’s also an equally generic party song and romantic song — in fact, all  the songs  turn out to be distractingly generic.
The film’s music, however, is guilty of a greater crime. What better to sap the magic out of the music in a children’s movie than auto-tune? It’s really only acceptable when it’s used by T-Pain or Auto Tune The News; the people over at Blue Sky Studios should have known that.
The only song that rises above the din is the expositional villain song, which has a higher level of comedy than the rest of the music. And if anyone thinks it sounds suspiciously similar to something Flight of the Conchords might sing, they’re close to the mark; Nigel is voiced by Clement, who is half of the singing comedic duo.
Clement and the two leads are not the only notable voice actors in the film. Other stars include George Lopez, Will.i.am, Tracy Morgan and Jamie Foxx. There are also brief appearances by Wanda Sykes and Jane Lynch.
The color palette of Rio is stunningly beautiful, but it’s also a bit bright and intensely hued.
Sure, the film is for kids, but some extra subtly and layering would have been appreciated by the older audience.
Despite the fact Rio lacks depth, it has enough warm moments to counteract much of the silliness. It’s constantly entertaining  because of the beautiful animation, the wide range of likeable characters, the solid jokes and the well paced adventure that’s about having fun and stepping out of one’s comfort zone.
Rio probably won’t be remembered in 10 years, but for now it’s a fun, colorful adventure.

Depending on who you ask, last Wednesday’s Skull and Dagger prank was either hilarious or mean-spirited and tasteless. According to a Daily Trojan online poll, students are essentially divided over whether the prank was upsetting or commendable — 35 percent of voters thought the prank was great, and 17 percent disapprove.
Cindy Lee | Daily Trojan
A Facebook event created last week advertised that Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board would be giving away 10 Coachella tickets to students dressed in the best costumes Wednesday. At 1 p.m. Wednesday, about 50 people in ostentatious and ridiculous costumes crowded around Tommy Trojan, hoping to win the free Coachella tickets.
Their reward, after a few nervous moments of anticipation, was the sight of a banner with a skull plastered across it being unfolded from the top of the Student Union.
The graduating seniors of Skull and Dagger, a semi-secret honors society on campus, traditionally play a prank on the unsuspecting USC population. Past pranks have included wrapping bicycles (and a student) to the racks in heavy cellophane, hosting a fake “College Fear Factor,” and having security guards walking around accosting students for wearing sunglasses “in violation of dress code.”
These pranks might actually have been humorous — watching students desperately run to class upon discovering their bikes taped up, for example, seems like it would be amusing. But this year’s Skull and Dagger prank crossed a line when it involved Program Board.
Not only did the prank damage Program Board’s credibility, but it also reflects poorly on the Skull and Dagger members who hold leadership positions in USG.
Whether or not the prank was funny is arbitrary. Skull and Dagger needs to realize that its fun might come at the expense of trusted and respected USC programs.
Last year, Skull and Dagger announced a fake “Student Appreciation Day” with claims of free food at The Lot. When expectant students showed up, the announcement was revealed to be a hoax. This negatively impacted business and service at USC Hospitality Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, told the Daily Trojan last year.
Some say the people upset with Skull and Dagger pranks are too uptight or lack a sense of humor. But the issue at stake is not whether the Coachella prank was juvenile and objectionable or brilliant and priceless, but it is a question of the unintended consequences of the prank.
Throughout the year, Program Board has hosted a number of interesting and fun events around campus.
And often, Program Board has publicized events on Facebook, so Facebook has become a reasonably reliable method of keeping up with all the latest fundraisers, giveaways, music festivals, movie showings, etc.
How else would we know when there is free CoolHaus at Tommy Trojan for USG Elections, free In-N-Out, DimSum on campus or another movie playing in McCarthy Quad?
It would be a gross exaggeration to say that Skull and Dagger’s prank completely undermines student trust in Program Board and USG.
Damage has been done, however. It was unnecessary to take advantage of student trust in Program Board and USG for the sake of a prank.
Pranks are never comfortable for the victims — that is the point.
But when these pranks begin to damage the trustworthiness and credibility of respected campus services, perhaps we should reconsider if this is truly “funny” anymore.
 
Rebecca Gao is a freshman majoring in global health and biological sciences. Her column, “Trojan Grounds,” runs Mondays.
Why does the Skull and Daggers website look like it was made in 1994?
How are people evenly split on this Rebecca? I thought USC students were smart enough to realize 35% is nearly double that of 17%.
These future movers and shakers are learning well what it means to wield such power when a default position of trust exists (they break it without consequence). Collateral damage is immaterial mostly because it is happening to someone else. Whether it was funny or if anyone was harmed is clearly less important to them than if the prank actually involves some legal liability or fails to get the visibility “semi-secret” societies seem to crave. I gather the overall purpose is to instill and reinforce the time honored notion that it’s not enough to win, but that someone else must lose. 
I think the author brought up many valid points. My view is that the concept of “not cr4pping where you eat” applies. Targeting students by pretending the origin was from a legitimate university entity with an otherwise credible false claim meant to cause them some level of distress means all of the Trojan family loses to some extent. 
You want to ferret out the gullible? Offer a one-way moon excursion ticket (return trip only). 
You want to misrepresent an offer so you can make someone else feel bad? Claim to provide some trivial incentive or reward for doing some volunteer community service task, and instead of the incentive being some trifle, make it unbelievably substantial. That way everyone who was considering helping out but failed to act on it would feel really crummy.
Now *that’s* funny!! – though the concept of a “win-win” scenario might just be far too grim for Skull and Boners to contemplate as it would deny the very essence of their worldview (a world comprised of predator and prey).
What is sad is that an organization from whose ranks are culled the future power elite seemingly have no more vision of said future than business as usual. Why, it’s as if rather than put their minds to some sort of effort and focus for the common good (an essential aspect of true leadership), their real concern is merely in continuation of a status quo that quite often has elitism bestowed based on things other than merit.
Free food, free tickets…my problem with these S&D pranks is that they are so tepid and lame. How about really making a prank show you mama boys have some cajones? How about a something like a bunch of uniformed officers looking to profile and stop all Muslim or black students? When people start to really become to the boilijg point you can say it was “only” a joke. S&D just needs to get over themselves in a big way
How would that be funny or decent?
How much time do you spend each week trying to come up with this pointless stuff? I don’t blame Rebecca anymore, I blame the DT for allowing her work to be published without sufficient adult supervision. If you want to talk about something damaging a reputation or image, start with how these opinion columns look in the DT. Come on. USC is too good for this stuff.
…come on.
Rebecca Gao, you are a freshman… you are so naive. Even in your first paragraph you commented on the stats that show approval of the prank. What is the basis then for your argument? get over it
No one was hurt, nothing was damaged, lots of people were fooled (including all but a few members of Program Board and USG – who are Skull and Dagger members)
What does this mean? It was probably the best prank USC has seen in ages, and shows how creative our school can be. (Even the costumes were creative) Why can’t people appreciate that instead of complain?
Good job to everyone involved!
“How else would we know when there is free CoolHaus at Tommy Trojan for USG Elections, free In-N-Out, DimSum on campus or another movie playing in McCarthy Quad?”
Well for one, you could read any of the 5+ different e-mail listservs that send out updates on Program Board and USG events…or you could check their websites. Or you could read any of the hundreds of flyers and advertisements Program Board and USG print and post all over campus every single week…or you could read the DT…or you could talk to any of the students related to USG or PB…or you could check their Twitter…shall I continue? Don’t be stupid.
And how was PB’s reputation “damaged”? It was a prank. Everyone knows it now. No one blames PB or USG. Because it was a prank. And most of the student body isn’t stupid enough to blame Program Board for a Skull & Dagger prank….

A federal appeals court affirmed an injunction placed on Arizona’s controversial immigration law SB 1070 last Monday, further halting action against illegal immigration in the state.
It’s become increasingly clear that more resources are being used to prevent illegal immigration than to enhance legal immigration in the United States.
This ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came a year after Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer initially proposed SB 1070, which would require law enforcement officials to question anyone they suspect of being in the country illegally, which many say will lead to racial profiling.
The proposed  law would require all immigrants to have their registration documents on hand at all times.
The law has incited the ire of immigrants and civil rights activists and drawn national attention to the need for comprehensive immigration reform not only in Arizona, but nationally.
In response to the law’s controversial provisions, the U.S. Justice Department filed suit against Brewer’s law in July, arguing that only the federal government can enforce immigration laws.
Brewer lamented that the ruling puts “the safety and well-being of Arizonans” in jeopardy.
Though I agree with Brewer, the very proposal of the law is a sign of the federal government’s  failure to fulfill its duty of securing our border and enhancing the lives of well-deserving and legal immigrants.
The fact that Arizona’s lawmakers felt the need to use local law enforcement to do the job of border patrol, thus distracting them from concentrating on protecting Arizonans, shows the effectiveness of our immigration system has hit rock-bottom.
The bigger problem, however, lies in the law’s definition of illegal: Both dangerous criminals and honest, hard-working individuals wishing to make a life for themselves are considered illegal.
It is troubling that a country founded on the ideals of democracy and hard work has still not made the distinction between these two groups and, as such, has not yet simplified the process for Mexican citizens and others to legally come to America.
It’s not that we should let everyone in just because they want to be here. But our country should allow more hard workers to prove their worth to our country by making it easier to obtain a worker visa, an idea Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has proposed repeatedly since 2003, but which has been regrettably shot down.
We can no longer lump  law-abiding and dangerous immigrants together.
By keeping the difficult immigration process the same, the federal government is merely perpetuating the influx of non-taxpaying illegal immigrants, both dangerous and well-intentioned, into a country already buried in debt.
Not only would a different approach to immigration allow immigrants to contribute their work and ideas to our diverse nation, it would increase our tax revenue and make it easier for border patrol to stop the potentially dangerous immigrants and those who are not willing to go through the process legally from entering the country and causing harm to our citizens.
America’s economic success was built on the backs of immigrants who were able to come here legally. Their innovation, hard work and passion for the opportunities America had to offer helped to create the country we live in today. We should honor that legacy.
Withholding this same chance from people willing to go through a reasonable immigration process is un-American, as is the government’s failure to protect the citizens who suffer because of  its inaction.
Immigrants today aren’t of a lesser caliber than those in the days of my great-great-grandfather, who came to America from Spain 100 years ago, and to suppose otherwise does a great injustice to those who want to be here for the same reasons we do.
 
Sarah Cueva is a freshman majoring in political science
illegal schmegal, potao poetato,tomato toemato………… all we need to do is put up a wall (like Berlin) and shoot anyone that tries to get in or out………………………. problem solved!
Sarah, so what would this magical law that separates “good” immigrants from “bad” immigrants look like? Exactly how do we “bell the cat”
The notion you are so passionate about pulling Mexicans into the US means you are admitting Mexico is unlivable.
Thank you Sarah for a thoughtful essay. Comments such as “We do not want America [U.S.] to have borders or laws.” and, “Law enforcement can’t simply walk up and ask someone for their papers for no [any] reason.”, make having a reasonable conversation difficult. Law enforcement more than anyone wants to resolve this issue, and not by creating flawed legislation.  Arizona type legislation is unfortunate, but let’s hope intelligent debate ensues.
Federally accepted anarchy has directly led to a swollen 43 million Americans living in poverty as well as 15 million unemployed Americans and legal immigrants. We have NO need for even one illegal invader, hard working or not.
Prior to the 1960’s our immigration quota was 100,000 a year. Now it is almost a million. Do we really need a million people coming into this country legally ever year? And another million coming in illegally?
“Both dangerous criminals and honest, hard-working individuals wishing to make a life for themselves are considered illegal.” No, they are only considered illegals, if they entered this country illegally, without applying for permission from the federal government. Immigration status has nothing to do if a person is dangerous or not. We have dangerous criminal who are in this country legally.
Sarah your story is full of misinformation. Federal law requires all legal immigrants to carry their papers. Local police are not being used to patrol the border.  The law only kicks in when a person is stopped for some other reason. For example, if a person is stopped for speeding and has no drivers license or insurance, then under this law the officer can ask for their immigration papers. Law enforcement simply can’t walk up and ask a person for their papers for no reason.
“It is troubling that a country founded on the ideals of democracy and hard work has still not made the distinction between these two groups and, as such, has not yet simplified the process for Mexican citizens and others to legally come to America.”
That translates to no limits on immigration.  Why beat around the bush?  Just say it.  We do not want America to have borders or laws.  Isn’t that what you are saying?

When illegal street art comes up, most people immediately think of Banksy. But another U.K. street artist proves in his first L.A. exhibit that he is just as edgy and thought-provoking.
Street cred · D*Face continues to produce street art, such as the spray-painted figure pictured above, along with his other artwork. - Photo courtesy of Earshot Media  
D*Face, whose artwork was put on display for the first time in Los Angeles at the Corey Helford Gallery on April 9, draws upon Andy Warhol’s vibrant use of color and geometric composition, while also taking cues from the vintage comic book aesthetic of Roy Lichtenstein and some of the wild figures of Keith Haring.
“Going Nowhere Fast,” D*Face’s L.A. exhibition, showcases the artist’s unique style.
Thematically, D*Face produces art that is, as he describes it, “aPOPcalyptic,” dealing with celebrity, popular culture and mortality. Much of his work involves death, whether he is putting skateboards inside velvet-lined coffins or depicting infamous movie stars as half-zombies.
D*Face also pokes fun at the seriousness with which we view public figures: Two of the most prominent pieces of the gallery’s upstairs display are a portrait of Queen Elizabeth, complete with nose-ring and magenta mohawk, and the Statue of Liberty sporting a sad clown face.
D*Face’s repertoire is very diverse, however, and extends beyond the exhibit. He has participated in a book cover designing project for the 50th Anniversary of Penguin Books, he created a portrait of Pope Benedict XVI for the Vatican and he worked with Christina Aguilera to design the cover art for her most recent album, Bionic.
And amid these commissioned projects, D*Face continues to produce illegal street art.
D*Face seems to scorn the idea of fame, as shown by a larger-than-life skeletal Oscar statue and a wall display of the Hollywood sign smoldering atop a mound of skulls. His work both immortalizes the idea of fame, while urging viewers to realize its dangerous results.
One of his most well-known images is that of a blond woman locked in a tearful kiss with a skeleton man. Done in the same manner as a Lichtenstein image, the piece appears to play upon the phrase “kiss of death” and can be seen as pushing viewers past their comfort zones to consider the grisly price of fame.
Another eye-catching display located in the main room is his “Flutterdies” sculpture series. Confined within glass cases hung on the wall, a menagerie of butterfly creatures beckon viewers to take a second look.
The bodies of these alluring insects are actually painted spray can caps and skulls, while the wings are authentic butterfly body parts, appearing in every shape and color.
D*Face’s work is extremely varied, since he creates sculptures, traditional wall pieces, squadrons of grinning knives that hang from the ceiling and murals that sprawl across the sides of the building.
It’s hard not to be entertained by the bright colors of his work, which contrast dramatically with the serious undertones of his obsession with death. D*Face both satirizes our cultural fear of death and reminds us that acquiring celebrity status isn’t always as glamorous as we are led to believe.
“Going Nowhere Fast” will be on display at the Corey Helford Gallery until April 27 and anyone who appreciates clever pop art with a morbid twist should definitely check it out.

It’s that time of year again: bikini season.
For many people, summer is an excuse to do absolutely nothing except chill at the beach with friends. But for us girls, it can be a bit of a struggle.
Time and again, society has created the image of the perfect woman. You know what I’m talking about — the one with flat abs, sculpted arms and the perfect, sun-kissed tan.
We shouldn’t have to compare ourselves to this idealized image of womanhood, but there’s no harm in raising our self-confidence and trying to get healthier for the summer season.
If you’re unsatisfied with your body or feeling insecure at the thought of donning a two-piece, following a few rules of thumb will help you go a long way, both physically and mentally. And when June rolls around, you’ll be feeling more confident, sexy and healthy than ever before.
 
DO: eat healthier and drink lots of water
To get your body in toning mode, exercise alone is not enough. You must be willing to change your diet to really tone your muscles and burn fat. One of the easiest methods is to replace processed foods with fruits and vegetables. Additionally, if you’re a meat-eater, lean protein foods like fish, chicken and low-fat dairy products contain unsaturated fats and more reasonable calorie counts.
When it comes to beverages, replace sodas, sugary drinks and alcohol with water. Water, like healthy foods, helps sustain muscle mass and promotes future growth.
 
DON’T: go on a crash diet
Your body needs a certain number of calories to function. By eating less, your body enters starvation mode, which slows your metabolic rate. In other words, your body reacts to the changes by taking energy from stored muscle, rather than from stored fat.
 
DO: buy a pair of dumbbells
Dumbbells are key when it comes to refining your muscles and sculpting your body. Though most people know them as tools to shape your arms and legs, dumbbells can also be used to engage your abdominal muscles and glutes.
Girls shouldn’t be afraid of lifting weights. Adding dumbbells to your workout routine doesn’t mean you’ll be sporting bulging muscles when you hit the beach. As long as you use dumbbells at least a few times a week, you’ll start to see toning without losing the natural contour of your body.
 
DON’T: do a thousand sit-ups a day
Few people seem to realize sit-ups and crunches play no role in determining how flat your stomach is. Although these exercises will strengthen your abdominal muscles, you still won’t see any changes in the shape of your stomach if a layer of fat is covering your abs.  The only fool-proof workout to target stomach fat is cardio, but you can never choose where you lose fat.
 
DO: throw in some cardio
You can’t expect to get a killer body without increasing your heart rate. Try to go for a 25-minute run at least three or four times a week to help you burn calories and excess fat. Although you can’t spot-treat fat-burning, running and other similar forms of cardio are great exercises for flattening your stomach.
 
DON’T: focus on losing weight or weigh yourself everyday
Getting a bikini body is not about losing weight. It’s about getting toned and fostering self-confidence. Weighing yourself everyday will only make you angrier about not shedding pounds quickly enough. In fact, you might gain weight in the end because you have replaced fat deposits with muscle mass.
 
DO: have an achievable goal and compliment yourself often
Your goal shouldn’t be to lose weight, but to like the way you look. By summer, you should feel healthier, more energized and more confident about your body. If you don’t acknowledge the efforts you’re making, you’re going to have less fun and become more critical of yourself. Be proud of what you’ve accomplished, even if you’ve only made minor changes.
 
DON’T: criticize yourself or expect perfection
The honest truth is that you’re not going to work out or eat healthily every day. It’s okay to reward yourself. Don’t feel bad if you sneak a cookie or “forget” to go for that morning jog.
Just keep your goals clearly established and try as hard as you want to. Even if you decide to permanently forego your routine, remember nobody is stopping you from flaunting that bikini this summer.

I used to wrestle in high school and I’ll tell you what works. 
Do: Put about 70% of your focus into cardiovascular exercise. Not only does this help you lose water weight, but it’ll trim bloating dramatically. There is no such thing as “spot reduction.”  Running is bar none the best exercise for this; do it for at least 20 min even if you’re not a “cross country” competitor; go at a brisk but comfortable pace. The first 20 minutes makes you lose water weight, the time thereafter burns fat. 
Do: drink nothing but water to hydrate, but don’t drink to the point where your urine is clear as water; you lose vitamins and minerals at this point.
Do: eat a sensible, healthy diet; but don’t starve yourself. Eat lots of fibers i.e. fresh fruits and veggies without dressing; your bowel movement will be pleasant and quick. Splurge now and then with some of your favorite fast food.
Don’t: eat too much salty foods; salt makes you retain water weight i.e. get bloated, and it raises your blood pressure.
If you’re not Maxim top 100 material, it’s OK. Everyone’s genetics are different and you got to “wear” your body to its max potential.
Very important info ladies:  Stop eating as you look fat!  Anything over 120 pounds is simply obese!
Don’t sugar coat it or anything.

How often do the thoughts of death, mortality and existence cross college students minds? Faced with a symbol of finality, how would they react? That’s what Jayson Kellogg wanted to find out with his photography project “Memento Mori.”
Taking its name from the Latin phrase for “remember you will die,” the junior sociology major’s collection of photos focus on different students reacting to a human skull that he bought on eBay.  Kellogg said the project started out as an assignment for a photography class, but evolved into a way of exploring human anxiety.
“I did two tours in Iraq with the Marines and being there you’re afraid of dying. It produces a lot of anxiety. While I was there, I dealt with death by not caring about my emotions,” he said. “I was just interested in my peers and contemporaries would deal with the subject matter.”
The project was showcased in Doheny Library on Friday as part of the College Commons’ Dehumanized Conference. Featuring more than 50 photos, it is an example of human reaction, as Kellogg gave the students the skull and then simply let them interact with it.
But, instead of quoting Hamlet and mourning Yorick, his subjects’ reactions left him surprised.
“Some people shocked me. You kind of have a stereotype of what someone’s going to do with an object. They’d probably not care or be freaked out by a skull,” Kellogg said. “But other times they’d break these stereotypes and really engage. It was really interesting.”
One student even took the skull and perched it on his shoulder like a parrot, much to Kellogg’s amusement.
For Kellogg, who served with the Marines in Iraq from 2006 to 2008, photography is a side project, but one that allows him to explore his surroundings and concerns.
“I did photography when I was in Iraq for fun on my own. It kind of takes you out of the scene,” he said. “It was relaxing and therapeutic for me.”
Back in the states and at USC, he kept an interest in photography, and found a way to showcase the work he did in Iraq.
“I had an exhibition of my art in the fall in VKC through the Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics,” he said. “This is really the second thing I’ve really done with photography.”
Although he was out of the war, some of the questions it had raised in him remained, and what started as an assignment blossomed into a chance for him to explore those topics.
“The idea originated with the skull back in the fall,” Kellogg said. “I bought a human skull on eBay at the end of the fall semester, and then I sat on it wondering how I was going to use it in an artistic piece. I wanted to turn to this theme in my life and deal with it in a more productive way.”
When he started, he was not expecting the variety of responses people would have to the skull. He was expecting more of a shared reaction to it, but one that was out of the ordinary for regular college students.
“A human skull is a universal symbol, symbolizes death and mortality,” he said. “It’s dealing with death and mortality. It’s a pretty heavy truth, it’s pretty intense. It’s not like people sit there in the middle of Trousdale and think about the most existential question of life.”
Unfortunately, the project was only displayed during his part of the conference, giving audiences only 30 minutes to see it. Kellogg is having trouble finding a place on campus that will showcase the photos.
“I’m putting the photos on my website, but I’m looking to find another place to show them,” he said. “It’s hard to find a place to present to showcase student work unless you’re an art major, which I’m not.”
With “Memento Mori” complete, Kellogg is starting plans for a new project for the summer and fall. Like his past work, it will deal heavily with introspection and personal reaction.
“It’s going to deal with issues of relationship and sex and identity and connection,” Kellogg said. “This piece is going to try and convey what it is to be a twenty-something in college. You’re learning to be an adult, to have a relationship. It’s not an easy transition. Society makes it a grand whole thing with sex and youth, and I’m going to try and convey that with these photos.”
Despite the broad focus of his topic, Kellogg’s reasons behind the project remain much more personal.
“In my experience, having to confront the things I’ve been through, I can relate to myself much better and in a much more intimate way,” Kellogg said.

Amy and Nick, of the Boston-based acoustic duo Karmin, are the current superstars of the Internet.
Uploaded just four days ago, Karmin’s cover of Chris Brown’s “Look at Me Now” has received over 1 million views.
At first glance, no one would guess they would cover any song like “Look at Me Now” or other songs by Eminem, Kanye West and Nicki Minaj. Amy, the eclectic lead singer and emcee, has a quirkiness that is similar to of Nicki Minaj. She has distinct facial expressions and a vintage Hollywood inspired look.
Amy and Nick’s harmonies are also impressive. On Karmin’s Youtube channel with only covers, they can be seen belting out Adele’s “Someone Like You,” Bruno Mars’ “Grenade,” Jessie J’s “Price Tag” and several others.
Nick plays a variety of different instruments, including piano, percussion and even trombone. He provides a great backbone for the duo, making each song unique.
Karmin may look like an unlikely group to be covering the songs they perform, but most cannot deny the skill and guts they have.
After checking out Karmin’s covers, go to their other Youtube channel to listen to original music. You can even pick their next cover tune. Go to their main website and find out how.

The Oscar winning actor, who is filming his new movie Medallion, in New Orleans, caught the police’s attention after getting into a heated argument with his wife over their current rental address.  He then taunted the cops, saying, “Why don’t you just arrest me?”  According to TMZ, it wasn’t until the second dare that the police took him into custody for domestic abuse and disturbing the peace.
Cage’s wife will not be pressing any charges since he didn’t assault her.
Later that day, at 2 p.m. the reality star Duane Chapman (Dog the Bounty Hunter) posted a $11,000 bail bond for Cage.
In a statement to E! News Chapman said, “I am a truly dedicated fan of Mr. Cage and will not be granting interviews about my client as I wish to respect his privacy.  I performed my duties as a bail bondsman and not in connection to our show.  This is what I do for a living.  There are two sides of my job: I release my clients after they have been arrested; and pick them up if they don’t show up in court.  I do not believe the latter will be the case for Mr. Cage.”
