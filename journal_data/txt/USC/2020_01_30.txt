Feminist and reproductive rights advocate Loretta Ross remembers what it was like to navigate an unplanned pregnancy following sexual assault. She remembers dealing with a number of social barriers. After enduring multiple instances of sexual assault, Ross decided it was time to advocate for reproductive justice she told a crowd of more than 40 students at an event hosted at Ronald Tutor Campus Center Wednesday as a part of the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment’s project on gender equality, a part of their annual Roe v. Wade activism project to promote on campus the importance of protecting the court decision.
“Every time I thought I was just going to live my life, something reproductive got in the way,” Ross said. “After enough of those incidents, I decided to focus on reproductive politics.”
Co-sponsored by the Undergraduate Student Government, Black Student Assembly and Political Student Assembly, the event was moderated by professor of political science Christian Phillips. 
Ross’ first activism project was at the DC Rape Crisis Center, where she faced conflicts from white feminists who were against the all-Black women’s clinic and from Black nationalists who believed the center should focus on fighting racism rather than injustices within their own community. 
“We used to get attacked not only by white feminists who didn’t think were feminist enough,” Ross said. “But by the Black nationalist movement who thought that we were betraying the movement by talking about violence of the Black community, that we were selling out to white feminists.”
Ross is the co-founder of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, an organization founded by a group of Black women that addresses the needs and rights of marginalized women. Ross is also one of the creators of the term “reproductive justice,” which combines reproductive rights and social justice. She said SisterSong has the power to promote social trends through modern sayings such as ‘rape culture’ and ‘reproductive justice’ that bring attention to women’s rights, especially to women of color. 
“By naming these things, we see power from people who were denied their existence,” Ross said. “The power of naming is the power of defining what is real, what are facts, what is reality.”
Ross said SisterSong has helped expand awareness of reproductive justice and has helped individuals maintain the knowledge that they own their bodies.
“One of the things that I’m impressed about is how people don’t take for granted that their bodies that their bodies are theirs to control,” Ross said.
In addition to an increased awareness about reproductive issues, Ross said there have also been impressive, structural changes to women’s rights, especially in regard to employment from 50 years ago.
“Job ads used to actually say ‘no women,’” Ross said. “If you’re a single woman, there were times you couldn’t get credit, unless you brought a man to sign the paper for you.”
Even though there have been improvements to reproductive justice, Ross said there still needs to be a more accessible and better framework for people to choose abortion.
“[The framework] is inadequate and incomplete, because even if the government doesn’t tell you whether or not to have a baby, you still need social support,” Ross said. 
Ross also talked about the group difficulties that SisterSong used to face in regard to accommodating each member’s different cultural origins and habits into the organization’s ideas
“There’s different cultures represented, different ways of expression, different ways of being in a room,” Ross said. “We also learned within SisterSong that it was wrong and usually non-productive to rush a decision.”
Krishan Patel, a sophomore majoring in communication and political science, said he attended the event because he is a pro-choice feminist.
“The focus on reproductive rights is not only a political one but personal,” Patel said. “I admire [Ross’] experience in organizing for progressive causes including reproductive rights for her lifetime.”

When she first entered college, professor Karen Tongson wanted to teach high school. A few years later, she decided teaching at the community college level was for her. Fast forward another few years and Tongson, then a graduate student, began imagining herself as a faculty member at a research university. 
Now, after 15 years as an associate professor at USC, Tongson is the first woman of color to be promoted to the rank of full professor in the English Department of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
Tongson, who teaches English, gender and sexuality studies and American studies and ethnicity, said that she hopes to use this promotion as a way to encourage ambition within her own students. Getting the position means having a chance to mentor students make sure other professors with similar goals have someone to reach out to for advice about the process.
“The main thing that I said on social media and that I’ve said elsewhere is that I may be the first but I certainly won’t be the last,” Tongson said. “And so among the things that I’ve certainly devoted myself to is mentoring other scholars of color, other women scholars of color in my different departments, making sure that they know the process, that it isn’t mystified to them and that they know how to get to this point.”
Currently minority groups make up 19% of tenured professors in the arts and humanities at USC. This is more than three percent less in comparison to the University as a whole, which has 23% minority groups in tenure. 30% minority groups are currently on track in the arts and humanities to gain tenure, according to USC institutional research data from 2016.
“It was very shocking for me to hear that would be the case if my promotion went through, given that the school has been around since 1880,” Tongson said. “But also because I myself was mentored by so many tremendous female professors of color in this department.”
Receiving a promotion to full professor in the English Department includes requirements of publishing peer-reviewed papers and two single-authored books, serving on department committees and continuing to teach as well. 
Tongson has taught a variety of classes at USC, including “Seminar in Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Studies,” “Introduction to American Popular Culture” and a Maymester course “Gender, Sexuality and Food Cultures in the U.S.” 
“I’ve taught such a range of different courses for undergraduates and graduate students,” Tongson said. “I love teaching my graduate seminars — I especially like teaching graduate seminars where there is not only a kind of critical intellectual component, it’s usually on LGBT studies, but [also] one that has a creative writing component.”
Tongson came to USC in Fall 2005 to begin her first tenure-track academic job after completing fellowships at UC San Diego and UC Irvine and graduating from UC Berkeley in 2003 with a doctorate in English. Reflecting on her past 15 years teaching here, Tongson said that her time here has passed very quickly and been full of surprises. She said being a female professor of color has meant having to serve as a role model for minority students and mentoring them as an educator. 
“We give so much of ourselves for our students … sometimes that also means that we kind of put some of our own work on the back burner,” Tongson said.  
Kyunghee Eo, a graduate student studying English and gender studies, said Tongson serves as an inspiration to many students because of how she has dealt with challenges as a queer woman of color in academia. Eo said that as more female students, queer students and students of color join the department, they benefit from working with faculty like Tongson who can relate with them and serve as a mentor. 
“We just assumed it’s a hard road being a woman of color in academia, but really after we learned she got full professorship — that she was, in fact, the first — it came as a bit of a shock to us,” Eo said. “It’s just kind of a reflection of how difficult things can be for minorities to survive in academia.”  
Eliot Dunn, a graduate student studying English, first met Tongson as a prospective student in the program. In the four years he has known her, he has taken her classes and worked with her on his writings and dissertation, which she is directing.
“I think what excites me about working with her is that she’s so open and excited about new ideas,” Dunn said. “It can be difficult and a little bit scary as a Ph.D. student to, especially in the beginning, bring your ideas to someone who’s such a senior faculty.”
Dunn also said that while he isn’t surprised that institutions have been slow at promoting minorities in academia, he was surprised to hear Tongson would be the first woman of color in the English Department to become a full professor.
“She probably shouldn’t have had to hustle quite so hard to get where she is,” Dunn said. “I’m sure that part of that is because she’s facing these institutional barriers. [It’s] really inspiring to see someone with that kind of drive and excitement for their profession, so I think she’s a really great role model for us.”
David Roman, a professor of English and American studies and ethnicity, has mentored Tongson and seen the work she has published in diverse fields including gender studies, literary studies, popular culture, critical race studies and queer theory prior to getting her position. He said he helped her navigate through the resistance she faced as a faculty member of color. 
“As a senior person of color in the department and as the first out queer professor of color in the department, the most important thing that I’ve been tracking with Karen is maintaining the quality of the work and helping her succeed professionally,” Roman said. 
Roman also said with the under-representation of Filipino scholars, Tongson serves as an example for both the community and for other faculty members to follow.
“Her position will be enormously inspiring to younger faculty members, who can see a role model now,” Roman said. “That’s always the thrill of seeing someone you know break a glass ceiling is that they become enormously inspirational figures.”

By discussing the public health crisis in communities affected by the coronavirus involving  limited resources, preventive medicine and international relations professor Heather Wipfli was able to delineate the differences between the outbreak situation in China compared to the U.S.  
More than 20 students attended Wednesday’s Global Policy Institute event to discuss the worldwide health implications of the outbreak and to receive updates on the epidemic event.
On Monday night, students believed the virus had spread to campus after the general manager of a nearby student housing complex sent a mass email to its residents claiming a student had contracted the illness. The University has since declared the claim false. 
Wipfli began the discussion by comparing the fatality rate and danger of the coronavirus to communicable diseases Ebola and rabies. According to Wipfli, the virus has a mortality rate of 2 to 3%, with no fatalities confirmed outside China. Wipfli explained how the situation in affected areas of China differs from U.S. cases. 
“[Wuhan] is an area of China that is impoverished, overrun health systems, overburdened and under-resourced,” said Wipfli, who has conducted research in global health policy and practices. “So probably lower [fatality rate] among well-treated, healthy population.” 
The World Health Organization requires that all countries report any novel disease within three days of receiving a positive laboratory test, a regulation the Chinese government has complied with, according to Wipfli.
Cecilia Pou, a sophomore majoring in international relations, asked why the virus rumors caused a widespread panic. 
“It fits very well into our stereotypes and Hollywood fears about global pandemics,” Wipfli said. “It has a lot of the characteristics of what could potentially be a really horrific outbreak.”
Wipfli said the lack of information about the virus’ effects has made some public health officials uneasy. She explained that the exact fatality rate, the origin of the outbreak and the time symptoms appeared in areas near Wuhan remain unknown. However, officials have confirmed that the coronavirus is spread before symptoms show, which makes the outbreak more difficult to control. 
“When you have these novel crazy diseases, that tells you that wherever this is happening the health system is broken, poverty is rampant [and the] people are doing risky behaviors,” Wipfli said. 
Thomas Kim, a senior majoring in international relations, asked whether the growing anti-vaccination movement will damage public health. Wipfli said the impact will be significant because public health and trust must unite in order to implement preventative measures. 
According to Wipfli, there is a 99% chance the coronavirus will be everywhere within one to two years and the outbreak will become as common as the flu. However, this does not mean individuals should not exercise caution. 
“[The health community] is not saying to relax and not worry about it,” Wipfli said. “They’re saying everyone should be doing surveillance, tracking carefully. Everybody needs to be doing their best to wash their hands.” 
Wipfli suggested growing supplies, skills and knowledge be established at state and national levels to prepare for future outbreaks. 
“We need to have at least a continental lab — a lab on every continent that’s able to test these nov el viruses — and also a team in place ready to respond urgently just to do a lot of capacity building in different regions,” Wipfli said. 
On an individual level, Wipfli recommended students practice good hygiene. Wipfli also debunked the common health belief of wearing a face mask to prevent contracting diseases, saying wearing a mask is only beneficial if you are currently sick. 
Matt Slade, a GPI fellow who hosted the event and a sophomore majoring in international relations, said he had been worried by the false report on Monday but that the discussion alleviated his fears.
“The biggest takeaway [from this discussion] is that [the coronavirus] is not a health issue — it’s more of a political issue,” Slade, said. “What we are seeing is not a virus that’s super dangerous or super deadly.”
Editor’s note: This article has been updated to clarify that Matt Slade is a GPI fellow who hosted the event

The No. 43 USC men’s golf team tied its own season-high by finishing in third place Tuesday at the Southwestern Invitational at the North Ranch Country Club. No. 6 Pepperdine shot 14-under while the Trojans tied with No. 10 Arizona State, finishing with a 3-over 867 team total.
The tournament marked the beginning of the Trojans’ spring slate, and their performance has drastically improved after finishing in last place at the Cypress Point Classic last fall. 
The Trojans got off to a rough start on day one, with five players shooting over par and the team finishing seventh in a field of 12. Later in the day, USC freshman Yuxin Lin and junior Leon D’Souza scored key birdies in the tournament’s second round that propelled USC to seven shots behind leader Pepperdine. 
By the end of the day, Lin dropped his score by four, going from 2-over par to 2-under par. This allowed the team to drop to 289 on the scoreboard in the second round and pass No. 18 UCLA, No. 27 Stanford and No. 29 Louisiana State. 
The players’ stamina was the deciding factor during the back-and-forth battle for second place during the tournament’s final 18 holes of play. Both the Sun Devils and the Trojans had two players finish under par at the turn of the course, but the Trojans reached 9-under in the final stretch to tie with ASU. 
Senior Kyle Suppa had five straight birdies, a season record, between holes 12 and 16 that dropped his card to 3-under. Suppa eventually returned to par again following a bogey and a double bogey. 
Junior Issei Tanabe tapped in three birdies on holes 15, 16 and 17 and bogied 18 to leave him at 1-under. Lin had a key eagle on 12 that helped him complete a 3-under 69 performance.
It was D’Souza’s 5-under 67 scorecard that solidified the second place standing. In the third and final round of the invitational, he birdied seven holes for a 5-under performance that would further subtract from his leading 6-under from the two prior rounds.
D’Souza was tied for first on the leaderboard with Pepperdine’s redshirt senior Sahith Theegala for the entirety of the tournament. The back eight of the final round is where the invitational’s winner is often decided. Theegala bogeyed 11 but quickly made up for it with two birdies on 12 and 16 to finish with a 6-under 66 round. 
D’Souza followed the same pattern by bogeying to 4-under. He then chipped in two birdies, but a fatal mistake on hole 17 led to an additional bogey D’Souza could not recover from.
“We both made a bunch of birdies throughout the day, and [hole] 17 was a tough hole and I hit a good shot but it just went a little too far,” D’Souza said. “I just gave myself a really tough up-and-down so it was just a small mistake.”
Even though the USC junior finished one short of the individual podium, the Southwestern Invitational marks D’Souza’s highest tournament placement as a Trojan. 
D’Souza joins Tanabe and Lin as standout players to watch for the remainder of the Trojans’ season. Previously, Tanabe carded four 68-shot rounds in the fall while Lin earned a berth into both the U.S. Open and the Masters after winning the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship last November.
USC will rely on the trio this upcoming season to maintain its level of play. If the Trojans look to continue their season beyond the Pac-12 Tournament and restore their preseason No. 11 rank, under-par play toward podiums in their final five tournaments will be necessary.
“We’re definitely trending in the right direction,” D’Souza said. “Everyone had a good run this week, if not today. We’re all playing good right now and we’re going to Hawaii on Monday, so hopefully we can continue moving on from here.”
USC will be back on the course next Thursday to compete in the Amer Ari Invitational in Waikoloa, Hawaii. The Trojans will face off against No. 3 Georgia Tech, No. 6 Pepperdine, No. 21 Auburn and No. 25 Texas, among a host of other opponents.

This past fall, the Houston Astros were exposed for cheating, and they paid the price. After a Major League Baseball investigation, the baseball world learned that the Astros had been using cameras to steal signs, which were then relayed by banging a trash can and used to signal upcoming pitches to batters. MLB handed down one-year suspensions to Astros manager A.J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow, took away the team’s first and second round picks over the next two years and fined the Astros $5 million.
That might sound like a hefty price to pay, but it’s not enough. Because of their unethical and inexcusable actions, the Astros should be stripped of their 2017 World Series title. 
MLB has been plagued by cheating for years — from multiple gambling scandals to the Steroid Era to what we have now with the Astros’ sign-stealing. 
Players and coaches in the MLB continue to cheat, and it appears that MLB can’t get them to stop. If the League wants to stop its organizations from constantly causing it headaches, it needs to take a stronger stance against these infractions.
The Astros have provided a perfect opportunity for MLB to finally take this stance, but the League missed its opportunity. Instead of taking away the Astros’ title, MLB has let them off the hook and sent the message that it’s okay to cheat if you win. 
Maybe that’s why former Astros bench coach Alex Cora used a similar cheating system with the Boston Red Sox more recently to win the 2018 World Series, but we will never know unless the MLB decides to put down harsher penalties for cheating.
One thing I will say is that at least the MLB is staying consistent with history with its decision. During the Steroid Era, superior slugging took hold of the league, and players like Barry Bonds got to keep their records despite the fact that they were exposed for cheating. It appears the MLB is erring on the side of consistency here rather than take a proactive stand against cheating.
Another problem with the MLB’s punishment is that, in the eyes of the Astros, it was all worth it in the end because they accomplished their goal. The punishments handed down by the MLB are a small price to pay for something that lasts much longer: a World Series championship. The championship was especially meaningful because it was the first World Series title in the history of the organization. 
It could be argued that even if the MLB took their title, it wouldn’t fix the past since it’s already happened. That is completely beside the point. What’s done is done, but you can’t let a team escape the consequences of cheating its way to a championship. MLB’s handling of the situation is like shooting a bank robber in the arm but letting them walk away with everything they stole. 
Would the bank robber think it was worth it? Yes. I’m pretty sure most robbers would take a shot in the arm in exchange for their freedom and a bunch of cash. Similarly, how many other teams would take the Astros’ punishment for a World Series title? I guarantee almost all of them would, but one name sticks out in particular: the Dodgers. 
Throughout this scandal, the one team hurt the most was the Dodgers. The 2017 World Series was a seven-game thriller that could have gone down as an amazing series. Instead, for the Dodgers, it is now a series of big what-ifs. What if the Astros batters didn’t know what pitches were coming? What if George Springer hadn’t ripped five home runs in seven games? 
The Astros’ cheating had a direct impact on the series, and I’d argue it’s the reason they beat the Dodgers in 2017. The Astros had five players with multiple home runs in the series. The Dodgers had two. The Astros had more hits, a higher batting average, a higher slugging percentage and better offensive stats in almost every other category as well. 
It’s not like the Dodgers had weak pitching either. In fact, it was the opposite. They had a stacked staff led by slingers Clayton Kershaw and Alex Wood and included a total of four pitchers with 12-plus wins. No, the Dodgers didn’t choke. The Astros were better hitters because they knew what was coming, and they had known what was coming all season. To put it simply, the Dodgers were cheated out of a World Series title. 
The L.A. team hasn’t won a World Series title since 1988. Losing to the Astros in 2017 halted the momentum that the Dodgers had been slowly accumulating for years. Winning in 2017 could have been a major turning point for the organization. Instead, it was cheated, and a year later, it was cheated again in the World Series, this time by a Red Sox team led by Cora and another sign-stealing system. 
Sure, the Dodgers have been successful in the past several seasons, but they still missed out on several chances to win their first World Series title of the century. You know who does have a World Series now? The Astros. By cheating, they’ve earned the right to celebrate a title they didn’t earn and most definitely don’t deserve, pissing on the name of baseball in the process. They should pay for what they did and have their false World Series title vacated.

HBO Sports has partnered with Ringer Films and Triple Threat TV to produce “Women of Troy,” a documentary highlighting the success of the famed USC women’s basketball teams of the early 1980s. 
Led by star players Cynthia Cooper and Cheryl Miller, the Trojan teams of the 1983 and 1984 seasons were thrust into the public spotlight. They had immense, unprecedented star power and success at a time when women’s sports, especially at the collegiate level, were largely off the radars of most sports fans. 
To many members of the women’s basketball community, the popularity and attention commanded by these dominant, multi-national-championship-winning teams paved the way for women’s sports to become more widely recognized and respected, eventually leading to the creation of the Women’s National Basketball Association, or WNBA, in 1996.
Gary Cohen, the owner of Triple Threat TV who assisted in the production of the film, spoke with the Daily Trojan about why the documentary was produced and what the production team intended to convey through it. 
Daily Trojan: What can fans of the team or people who lived through these teams’ success expect to get from this documentary that they don’t already know? 
Gary Cohen: Well, a lot of that comes down to the storytelling approach. So let’s assume you were one of the women on this team. You know everything there is to know about this team, what you don’t know is you don’t know how Alison [Ellwood], our director, and the storytelling team chose to tell the story. And in essence, the premise of the film is that this was an extraordinary team that provided the bridge from the past to the present, that really leaped the game forward in terms of their talent and their attitude and their skills — and in so doing, created the possibility that women’s basketball was more than just a marginal sport, and ultimately this was an important step in the evolution of the sport that made the WNBA possible. 
DT: Was USC the school that you felt provided the most accurate representation of what you wanted to convey? Why tell the story now?
Cohen: Yes, it was USC, but it wasn’t USC — it was these women, and specifically, the story is really the story of Cheryl and Cynthia. If you lived through that era, Cheryl was a transcendent talent. She played a sport that nobody cared about, and she made people care about her and know about her even if you didn’t know or care about the sport.  She was that good, she was that charismatic. 
Cynthia was a supporting player and yet, when the WNBA came along 12 years after they were both done at USC, Cheryl by virtue of injury was nowhere to be found, Cynthia became the leading lady and Cynthia dominated the WNBA the first four years of its existence. The fact that they were teammates and they came up together in the game at USC is really the essence of the story.
 And obviously the rest of the team too, the McGee twins — and the McGee twins are sort of lost in the bright lights that have to be shined on the Hall of Fame talents — but those were two extraordinary players. And so it was kind of an all star lineup, and they won two national titles, and they really sort of changed the way people looked at women’s basketball and made things possible for all the girls and women that came after them. 
DT: You’re heavily involved in sports and you have been for a long time, but did you learn anything new from producing a piece like this, or is there anything you really felt like you wanted to share? 
Cohen: Yeah, the biggest thing I wanted to share was a sense of obligation to women’s sports enthusiasts. You know, when I started, every time you do a film or a documentary, you feel a tremendous sense of obligation to the people that you’re portraying. This is their story and you’re telling it, and so when we did this, we knew we had to get it right for Cheryl and for Cynthia and the McGees, and for Rhonda Windham and Juliette Robinson and Linda Sharp. 
That was our obligation and that’s always the case. In this case, the additional burden was getting it right for the whole community of women’s basketball because there haven’t been a lot of high-profile films made about women’s basketball and this one — if we got it right — will live on for a long time within the community as an important statement of “This is where we came from.” 
So one thing that’s worth you knowing, our director Alison Ellwood, who is at Sundance right now, she is a major figure in the documentary world, a brilliant storyteller and for her this is sort of a statement of purpose. This is a female empowerment story that’s important and speaks to so many larger things about what women are capable of if given the opportunity, even in sports, a world where we think of women’s achievements in a different light than we think of men’s achievements.
DT: That was supposed to be my last question but I’m just kind of curious, how was sourcing for a piece like this? Were people really eager to be involved or was it difficult to find people who would be credible enough to touch upon this? 
Cohen: Oh no. The women’s basketball community is a powerful community, Cheryl and Cynthia and those USC teams are profoundly respected. So every time I reached out to somebody to gauge them about the project, they were profoundly supportive and went out of their way to make time and to become part of it, so we have a Hall of Fame lineup. Our interviews are with Geno Auriemma and with Doris Burke, and with Jackie MacMullan, Ann Meyers Drysdale. The people that are in the film that weren’t on that team are kind of all Hall of Famers, and so it really lends a gravitas to the film that makes it resonate. 
“Women of Troy” is set to air on March 10, ten days before Women’s March Madness begins.

At the beginning of this semester, a School of Cinematic Arts screenwriting class made a change to its attendance policy. The syllabus notes that “instructors will no longer distinguish between an excused or unexcused absence. An absence will be an absence.” After missing more than two classes, each student’s grade will be lowered by 10% for every further absence. 
While this may seem like an innocuous change to encourage students to attend more of their classes, it ignores many serious physical and mental health issues that could result in more absences. Considering the student deaths on campus last semester and the numerous calls by students for more mental health services, this policy must be changed in order to account for any extenuating circumstances that may arise for SCA screenwriting students.
The wording and execution of this policy change appear to undercut its good intentions to encourage attendance. Many screenwriting classes meet only once a week, making attendance significantly more important than it would be in a class that meets two or three times a week. A student who failed to attend a class would miss out on a significant portion of their instruction time for the semester. However, by failing to account for any extenuating circumstances, the policy appears antagonistic toward those who may be struggling with health issues and are thus unable to attend class. 
This policy also continues to stigmatize students in our community who are struggling with their mental health. USC Annenberg Media reported that “in the Fall 2019 semester alone, school records show there were 49 USC students who were held in a hospital for their own protection after authorities were alerted they might be a danger to themselves or to others.” 
This is shocking, considering how there were only 52 such hospitalizations in all of 2018. For students with mental health issues, this presents just one more thing about which they have to be concerned. Missing five classes would drop a student with a 100% grade to a 70%, a grade that would require them to retake the class in order to receive major or minor credit. SCA should prioritize student mental health, especially considering the campus-wide cries for increased mental health awareness and care.
Students’ physical health could also be jeopardized by the continued enforcement of this policy. Students who have a contagious illness or simply are not well enough to sit in a lecture hall or workshop for multiple hours may attend class to not lose one of these precious absences. They may not be well enough to properly contribute to the class, or they may infect other students. Even though students may have only missed one class due to an illness, the looming threat of dropping a whole letter grade may force them to attend class, further prolonging their illness.
Besides any health issues that may arise for students, this policy leaves little room for students who know they are going to miss class due to religious holidays or family commitments. In either case, students may essentially forfeit one of their absences right out of the gate, leaving them with even less leeway when it comes to health issues, family emergencies or any other circumstances that may arise. In these cases, one prolonged illness or one mental health episode could result in a student dropping a whole letter grade. As opposed to punishing students for any of these extenuating circumstances, SCA as a whole should be working with students, not against them.
Overall, the policy is worded so as to punish students for missing class for any reason, regardless of its credibility. By no longer distinguishing between excused and unexcused absences, students are less likely to report absences to instructors, as getting in touch with professors would do nothing to change their grade. This cuts another possibility of intervention, as an email to an instructor explaining an absence could be another avenue through which a student could receive help with health problems. 
While students with chronic health conditions could get accommodations through USC Disability Services & Programs, this new policy just adds another step that students who are struggling with their health may be unwilling or unable to undertake. Even if this is the case, the screenwriting division has not made it clear in the text of its policy how students may go about getting other absences forgiven. This policy must be more clearly articulated and revised to accommodate student health, religious beliefs and any other occurrences in students’ lives.

Through USC’s Recreational Sports program on-campus gyms offer unlimited workout classes to students with the purchase of a $110 semester-long pass. Exercise classes that are currently offered include boxing, cycling, F45, Zumba and yoga.  
These classes present a great opportunity for students to stay active with a variety of options. However, the addition of a self defense class to the workout bundle at USC gyms would lead to benefits beyond a rise in endorphin levels. 
First and foremost, self defense classes are a beneficial means of teaching participants how to protect themselves. 
The Police Bureau of the City of Portland defines a self defense class as “a set of awareness, assertiveness, verbal confrontation skills, safety strategies and physical techniques that enable someone to successfully escape, resist and survive violent attacks.” 
Specific skills learned include chokeholds, grabs, takedowns, foot stomps, groin kicks and kicks to the sides of the knee. These skills are critical in a world where women’s safety is in jeopardy by simply walking down the street after sunset or going out for a jog in a sparsely populated area. 
A self defense class cannot  guarantee prevention of assault, and most importantly those who choose not to take self defense classes are not at fault if they are attacked. That blame lies solely on the attacker. 
However, self defense classes can offer the skills needed for people to feel more comfortable with defending themselves if a dangerous situation were to occur.  
A study conducted at the University of Washington found that apart from teaching people how to protect themselves, self defense also boosts self esteem, increases feelings of assertiveness and decreases levels of anxiety. 
USC currently offers students two different ways to take a self defense class: a self defense class and a Department of Public Safety training program. 
The one-unit class teaches “strategies for standing and ground fighting situations with and without weapons.” However, not everyone has room in their schedule to add an extra unit, which means a portion of the student body is prevented from taking this course. 
Additionally, DPS offers self defense classes through the Rape Aggression Defense System, a program taught at many different campuses. This program is more of a certification course than a workout class, and it requires 12 hours of hands-on training for a participant to receive a certificate of completion. This program is completely free, but students must fill out a form online to register.   
Although this certification course is free and accessible to everyone, students may not even know of its existence. Furthermore, some students may want more of a class setting they can return to throughout the semester rather than taking self defense as a training program that ends in 12 hours.
These resources show that USC is providing options for self defense education, but adding a self defense class to the workout pack in the USC gyms will make self defense a more commonly known and widely used resource on campus. Many students look at the workout class schedule on a weekly basis, which would bring much more attention to self defense classes.
In fact, the addition of self defense to the workout bundle could be as simple as infusing more self defense techniques into boxing or kickboxing classes instead of creating a whole new class.  
Students may be hesitant to register through an official program from DPS and may instead feel more comfortable just showing up for a workout class with their friends at the gym. Those who do not want to pay for a class pack may be more likely to find the DPS training after doing research for other self defense options. 
Self defense provides essential long-lasting skills, knowledge and effects that make it more meaningful than a way to burn calories for an hour. Because of its extreme importance, USC should add it as workout class for students to take at the USC gyms.

The work of novelist and playwright James Baldwin is having yet another resurgence. Dagmawi Woubshet, the Ahuja Family presidential associate professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania, discussed the revival of Baldwin in the current generation along with several other aspects of the literary icon’s life, writing and image on Monday.
The event, titled “The Fierce Legacy of James Baldwin: On Love, Race, Religion, and Sexuality,” was sponsored by USC’s English department and populated with scholars and students alike.         
The presentation touched on Woubshet’s upcoming book “Here Be Saints: James Baldwin’s Late-Style.” While he conceded that sects of the population had kept Baldwin’s work alive since his death, most notably other Black queer authors, Woubshet contends that the level of recognition he has received in recent years makes this resurgence particularly noteworthy. Among this recognition he cited recent acknowledgments of Baldwin’s work: former President Barack Obama’s use of a Baldwin quote during the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the founding of the “James Baldwin Review,” an annual journal in Baldwin’s honor, the documentary “I Am Not Your Negro” developed from a letter written by Baldwin and the film “If Beale Street Could Talk.”
Woubshet called Baldwin a “rare artist” and “preeminent public [intellectual],” showcasing quotes from the author that he found most indicative of his influence. With each quote projected across the screen behind him, he commented on the prevalence of Baldwin’s words among younger populations. Many quotes he included in his presentation were very popular on social media, particularly Twitter.
The bulk of the presentation concerned the differences between Baldwin’s early works and those published later in his life — specifically the collection of essays “The Fire Next Time” and the essay “To Crush the Serpent,” which Woubshet considered a late sequel to the collection. 
What was of primary interest to Woubshet were the differing ways in which Baldwin looked back on his experience as a young evangelical preacher. One of the primary contrasts was the outright address of Baldwin’s sexuality in “To Crush the Serpent.”
During the Q&A session after the presentation, Woubshet received a question about an earlier acknowledgment Baldwin made of sexuality in a late 1940s essay. Woubshet was sure to distinguish that, while the essay was revolutionary for the time, it lacked the “I” which was a trademark of Baldwin’s personal narrative essays. He called “To Crush the Serpent” an “unflinching characterization of the author’s sexuality.” He said this unflinching characterization was largely unprecedented in his previous work, and it was a part of what compelled him to focus on that essay in his book.
To the question of what makes Baldwin’s work resonate today, Woubshet simply replied “vulnerability.” 
“I can find myself in a Baldwin essay,” Woubshet said.
He continued on to discuss how his work licenses readers to question themselves and their own vulnerability, which in turn enables his words to stand the test of time.
Dr. Zakiyyah Jackson, an assistant professor of English at USC who organized the event, cited “the novel invention of literary form” as one of the author’s most striking traits. 
“James Baldwin really was someone who took established forms and pushed those established forms to the limit or even ruptured those forms,” Jackson said. “[He’s] just such a brilliant and emblematic writer to think with in terms of what makes African American literary tradition distinctive.”
Jackson explained that the choice in Woubshet as the speaker for the event was a decision influenced by his strides in African American literary study. 
“[I believe Professor Woubshet] is a really gorgeous reader,” Jackson said. “And I wanted the students to get a model of the kind of reading practice that I’m trying to teach them and for it to come alive for them from somebody else other than me.”
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled James Baldwin’s name. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Holiday wrapping paper and string lights decorated the bottom floor of my house, void of furniture. Sitting criss-cross applesauce, my friends and other local music lovers sipped hot cocoa as they intently watched artists perform on the kitchen-turned-stage-floor. The performers took turns singing and playing acoustic guitar on a cheap Ikea dining table chair, transforming the most simple, scrappy setup into a real venue for their personal lyricism and sweet melodies. 
Although I hosted this house show after classes had officially ended, just before winter break, the event was undoubtedly the highlight of last semester. Very little makes me happier than inviting some of my most talented pals to entertain a house full of friends who come to soak up live, local music. Creating a tangible sense of community with art reminds me how great it is to be alive. For days, I could not stop talking about how beautiful the show was. 
Or I suppose I still can’t stop talking about it. Hear me out: These artists are your neighbors, your classmates, your fellow TacoZone patrons. I promise you’ll want to support them too.
Opening the show was Fringe Friend, a project led by Elon Wertman, a senior majoring in music production. He introduced each song with a story about its meaning, sharing vignettes with the cross-legged college kids sitting before him like it was preschool storytime.
Many of the songs he performed came from his debut EP “Prescience,” which was released at the beginning of last summer. Wertman’s alternative folk tracks combine his storytelling nature with a strong vocal belt, commanding the audience to listen to the tender things he wrote about the people he loves. “I’m Here,” a crowd favorite, begins with Wertman exclaiming “I’m a door!” as a quirky, catchy hook that sticks in the minds of listeners instantly. While chatting with the crowd after his set, I heard multiple people singing about being doors, too. 
Next came Natalie Lee, whose stage name is Manley, a senior majoring in music industry. Lee is known for the inclusive concerts she throws with the rest of her team at Sleezehog Productions. Because she constantly books other bands to perform, Lee rarely gets the opportunity to perform her own music. I find that to be an absolute shame, so I decided to book her myself. 
If I were to describe Lee’s music in two words, I would use “emo” and “gay.” I, too, am emo and gay. Thus, I love her music. Writing about subjects like unrequited love and losing family, Lee tugged at the audience’s heartstrings on that mid-December day. Her latest EP, “You Wouldn’t Know What’s Good for You Even If It Hit You in the Face,” came out last year. The project features a pop track about a crush titled “When Girls Go,” which I’ve played on repeat and which she used to close her set on a lighter note. After Lee finished, my friends turned to me, saying, “So good. So sad.”
The Midnight Contender then took the stage. Midnight is the stage name of Ritwik Krishnan, a sophomore majoring in music production, and we go way back. We went to high school together, and I would photograph the concerts he held with his old band, The Cautious. 
Like Lee, Krishnan writes with melancholy, often writing about bittersweet love and struggles with himself. “She keeps asking why I’m always smoking weed / I tell her ‘cause I hate myself” rang through my house as the crowd sang along to his incredibly blunt, sad lyrics to “it doesn’t get better (it never gets better),” which he has posted on SoundCloud. The desperation of Krishnan’s depression grows clearer as the song continues until he is almost shouting. When he finishes the song on a softer note, the audience is left silent and still.
Sophie Feldman, a sophomore majoring in popular music and psychology, finished off the show. She was highly recommended by Krishnan, who said, and I quote, she “writes the best fucking music ever.” Trusting his opinion, I shot her a text after listening to some of her tracks on Spotify. 
Most of the songs Feldman performed that day were ones she had written for her songwriting classes at USC, but the fact that they were school assignments did not diminish their quality. Watching Feldman perform was like listening to her read her diary out loud, confessing her thoughts and fears about relationships and growing up. For a couple of her songs, Feldman brought in two friends of hers to harmonize, and it was angelic.
