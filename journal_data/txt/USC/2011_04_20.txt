It is not uncommon for  USC students to spend more time surfing social media sites like Facebook and Twitter than paying attention to lectures, professors are finding, ways to use those sites as teaching tools with the classroom.
A recent study by the Babson Survey Research Group and Pearson found more than 80 percent of college faculty are incorporating some form of social media in their teaching.
Twitter in particular has found its way into USC classrooms because it allows for a constant, ongoing conversation between students, teachers and the rest of the world.
Social media tools like Twitter can enhance learning because they provide the ability to interact with anyone with an account, according to Robert Hernandez, assistant professor of professional practice in the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.
“It’s a perfect place for a learning environment because people are constantly sharing knowledge,” Hernandez said. “It’s a different way of thinking that everyone in the room has different experiences and we can all learn from each other.”
According to the study, more than 40 percent of college faculty have students view or read information on social media as part of the classroom assignments, and 20 percent of teachers require students to interact on social media sites.
Ken Sereno, a professor of communication at USC, said he tried using Twitter as a way for students to respond to certain assignments, and a way to monitor feedback from students during his lectures, but said the trial wasn’t very successful.
Sereno said he is not opposed to the idea of adopting social media in the future, but he first wants to see significant research demonstrating the usefulness of such tools in the classroom.
Even Facebook can be a learning tool, especially during those moments when students have trouble finding information for a class.
YouTube is also often used in the classroom to show videos, but the terms of fair use associated with Viacom, the leading global entertainment content company, have made it more difficult, said Virginia Kuhn, associate director of the Institute for Multimedia Literacy and a cinematic practice professor.
According to Kuhn, YouTube has disabled videos and issued takedown notices on behalf of media conglomerates like Viacom who, for instance, owns The Daily Show and the Colbert Report.
If a student was to do a project for a class using clips from those shows and then post it on YouTube, it likely would be taken down, because companies like Viacom don’t see YouTube as a learning environment, Kuhn said.
Spanish professor Charles Paus, however, said YouTube has nonetheless been a great tool for his classes.
“I use YouTube as a resource for movies in Spanish,” Paus said. “It’s a great resource for material for teaching foreign language because I can find clips from TV shows in Spanish.”
Though some classes and students have found a way to take advantage of social media, it is not necessarily useful in every classroom.
“I’m only in science classes, so there never is a purpose to use social media,” said Chase Turner, a sophomore majoring in biology.
Elinor Accampo, a USC history professor, said she isn’t looking for a way to incorporate social media into her classroom because students seem resistant to interacting with teachers on such a personal level.
“I don’t think there’s a need for bringing Facebook into teaching because students use it for personal reasons,” Accampo said. “Recently the subject of Twitter came up in class and students were appalled at the fact that I could be communicating with them through Twitter.”
Other members of the USC faculty agree with Accampo and believe privacy issues are a concern when using social media sites in classrooms.
“When students have Facebook as kind of their social space and then you try and sort of intrude with the classroom onto that space, it can get a little creepy, it’s like watching your mother try out for cheerleading,” Kuhn said.
Though it might be difficult to implement social media in the classroom, some students said they enjoy when teachers do.
“Social media in the classroom is a phenomenal thing and it’s under-utilized,” said Christen Lazarcheck, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism. “It creates so many windows of opportunities, and it’s a huge compilation of knowledge.”
Lazarcheck said social media can be used as a teaching tool to stay current with the news and provide an easy opportunity for students and teachers to connect with others about timely topics.

Students advocated for an improved general education program and increased transparency at an open forum hosted by the The Strategic Planning Committee on Wednesday.
The forum, held in conjunction with the Undergraduate Student Government, Graduate and Professional Student Senate and the Office of the Provost, gave students a chance to provide input on the university’s future and the strategic plan.
“We need all of you students for this,” said Robin Romans, associate provost of undergraduate programs and a member of the committee. “The university’s broad vision for the future will come in large part from the input of outspoken students.”
The strategic plan is a document drafted by university officials with the input of various university groups to set goals for the future and detail ways to accomplish those goals. Some goals in the past have been strengthening interdisciplinary education and research. This strategic plan aims to find ways to distinguish USC from other leading research universities.
“People know what a Harvard person or a Yale person is going to be, what kind of skill set they’re going to have,” said James Brecher, secretary general of the Academic Senate and another member of the Strategic Planning Committee. “Ten or 15 years from now, when people see a USC person, we need to make sure that they know what that person will have to offer.”
Student input is necessary in ensuring the plan focuses on providing a broad vision of the university as it moves into the future and helps students orient themselves to the university and its goals.
Romans started the forum by outlining the process of creating the strategic plan. The process involves six subcommittees composed of faculty, staff and students as well as open forums and feedback both in physical meetings and on the Strategic Planning Committee’s website.
Some students said they want an easier way to track developments within the university, suggesting ideas such as publishing more information on the internet or allowing for more student representatives to be involved in university decisions.
In addition to transparency, several students took issue with the way the general education requirements forced students to take classes that might add little to their overall education.
“We’re not really getting a well-rounded general education because we’re all learning the same thing,” said Liz Trower, a senior majoring in political science. “The skills I came away with were identical in each of my ten different general education classes. Right now the GEs almost exclusively address the same skills of writing and critical thinking.”
Several students seemed to think it would be more beneficial if the general education program was instead geared toward allowing students to explore possible interests.
“Rather than having to choose from the six GE categories, maybe there could be major-specific or school-specific general education programs that allow students to take classes relevant to them,” said Monish Tyagi, USG president.
Preparation for the strategic plan began in 2008, when faculty members of the  Strategic Plan Working Group cconvened to lay the groundwork. The Strategic Planning Committee aims to have a draft ready for review by President C. L. Max Nikias and Provost Elizabeth Garrett by this summer.
Interesting that students are concerned about too much critical thinking when a recent national study came out showing there’s far too little advancement in this skill for the vast majority of college graduates.  But perhaps there needs to be a selection of–God forbid–some pre-professional vocational classes if only to alleviate some of the tedium of redundancy.

Not everything began with Stonewall. Such is the pretext of Glenne McElhiiney’s On These Shoulders We Stand,  a new and groundbreaking documentary about Los Angeles’s gay, lesbian,  bisexual and transgender community from the 1950s through the early  1980s.
On Thursday night, McElhiiney will screen her film on campus in  Taper Hall Room 202 at 6 PM. The event will be moderated USC’s own  Professor Chris Freeman, a scholar of English and American literature  and co-editor of Love, West Hollywood,  an anthology of GLBT stories and memoirs centric to Los Angeles. For  Freeman, Thursday’s screening – sponsored by the USC’s Queer and Ally  Student Assembly – is a welcome colaboration.
“Glenne  contacted me when she was working on post-production,” said Freeman.  “She knew about my work on gay LA–we had many mutual friends. I was so  impressed with her right away–truly a self-made filmmaker. She was  inspired by the documentary PARAGRAPH 175 about gays in Germany–and she  knew that she wanted to pursue documentary and oral history projects.”
Indeed, On These Shoulders We Stand draws  the lion’s share of its power from the many Angelenos – most of them  now senior citizens – interviewed by McElhiiney. Their oral accounts of  harassment, intimidation and eventually, activism for equal rights hold a  powerful magnifying glass to a movement that has largely been excluded  from mainstream education materials.
“My first thought was that I would be so excited to teach [the  film],” said Freeman, who currently teaches Queer Los Angeles: Making  History, Making Culture. “The stories are honest; the history is  accurate; the film is beautiful.
Among the film’s many powerful threads is the story of Nancy  Valverde. An out lesbian in the 1950s, Valverde was repeatedly accosted  and arrested by Los Angeles police officers for infractions as minor as  wearing clothes that were deemed inappropriately masculine for a woman –  a crime at the time. Though her experiences were greatly traumatic,  Valverde refused to relent and would find herself within the ranks of  Southern California’s early gay rights movement in the 1960s.
“Nancy took control of her life and destiny, educating herself  to fight the police harassment she experiences for over a decade,” said  Freeman. “Today, we take for granted that we can go to the Abbey and  have a martini with our partners–hold hands, even smooch a little. That  simple night out was not only difficult; it was dangerous 30 or 40  years ago. A person could be arrested, harassed over what today seems  like nothing.”
Valverde, along with other cast members of the film, will attend  the screening for a Q&A session to follow the screening. Freeman is  confident that the attendance of the film’s seniors will enhance the  experience of the film for first time viewers.
“I’ve been lucky enough to have Glenne screen the film for my  Queer LA course twice,” Freeman said. “Each time, the students have been  struck by the poignant stories in the film. The lives from days gone by  come to life, and the people who lived to tell the tales get to have  their say.”
Freeman also noted that McElhiiney’s film is unique for its  acknowledgment of the more optimistic aspects of Los Angeles’s early LGBT community. Such optimism is most evident in the film’s seniors  themselves, who refuse to lionize themselves as crusaders of a cause,  but gregarious, humored individuals who were thrust into a battle  without warning. Like most people would, they fought back. On These Shoulders We Stand is a testament to those early battles and their great significance for  the present and its increasing victories for America’s entire LGBT  community.
“I love talking to audiences about this film,” Freeman said. “I  love Glenne and respect her and her work so much–and the individuals in  the film are heroes of my tribe.”

When junior forward Nikola Vucevic declared for the NBA draft on March 25, USC coach Kevin O’Neill vowed to recruit one or two new players who were ready to contribute to the team.
True to his word, O’Neill convinced Wake Forest transfer Ari Stewart to verbally commit to USC.
Stewart announced the news on his Twitter account Wednesday morning, posting a picture of the inside of the Galen Center with the caption, “Oh yea [sic], my new home.”
He requested and was granted his release from the Demon Deacon basketball program March 23 after he had previously been suspended for the ACC tournament due to academic concerns.
“Ari is a fine young man who has chosen to pursue happiness somewhere else,” Wake Forest coach Jeff Bzdelik told reports when asked about Stewart’s departure. “And I wish him well. It provides another young man with an opportunity.”
Stewart was on USC’s campus over the weekend to see the university.
Stewart will have to sit out the upcoming season as a result of NCAA transfer rules. He can begin playing for the Trojans during the 2012-2013 season and will have two years of eligibility remaining.
Stewart is a 6-foot-7, 205-pound forward from Marietta, Georgia. As a freshman, he finished fifth on the Demon Deacons with an average of 7.3 points per game. He led all ACC freshmen by shooting 37.1 percent from beyond the arc.
As a sophomore this past season, he averaged 8.5 points and 4.4 rebounds per game, but his three-point percentage fell to 27.4 percent. He did not score in the last four games he appeared in, after scoring in double figures in ten of his first 11 games; Wake Forest ended the season on an 11-game losing steak.
With Vucevic and senior forward Alex Stepheson departing, USC will be forced to rely heavily on an inexperienced frontcourt next season. The Trojans’ post rotation will include transfers James Blasczyk, DeWayne Dedmon and Aaron Fuller, in addition to Curtis Washington, who did not score last season.
Only two of the Trojans’ top seven scorers from last season, guards Jio Fontan and Maurice Jones, will return next season.
Not ready to contribute next year so what is the big deal. Rather recruit a top player out of high school for the following year which Coach O’Neill doesn’t seem capable at this juncture. Taking other schools mal content so the Trojans have become the University of Second Chance.

After the USC men’s basketball team was ousted in the First Four of the NCAA tournament, I thought there was a slight possibility it could lose junior forward Nikola Vucevic to the NBA after a stellar season. After all, who would blame him?
I’d probably get tired shouldering USC’s inconsistent offense and facing constant double teams every night, too.
So when the decision was made official at a press conference last month, I wasn’t completely surprised, and immediately started thinking about how our basketball team would look next year.
Losing Vucevic, along with forward Alex Stepheson, our only other big man who played this year, will definitely hurt, and losing guard Donte Smith and guard Marcus Simmons won’t help.
USC will lose its top scorer, its only two big men, its best shooter and its best defender.
That’s not exactly the recipe for success heading into next season.
But now that news of other players in the Pac-10 declaring for the NBA draft has spread, concerns about the aftermath of losing Vucevic, and the other three seniors don’t seem so bad after all.
Arizona forward Derrick Williams, Washington guard Isaiah Thomas, UCLA guards Malcolm Lee and Tyler Honeycutt and Washington State guard Klay Thompson have all put their names into June’s draft has alleviated my worries about how bad USC basketball will fare next season.
That’d be three of the top four scorers in the conference in Williams, Thomas and Thompson,  plus one of the most versatile players in the conference in Honeycutt and one of the best defenders in the conference in Lee.
With these players not returning, their teams take huge hits.
Even with these top-tier players leaving, Jon Wilner of the Mercury News believes USC will finish ninth out of 12 teams in the Pac-12 next season.
In no way do I believe USC will be that bad.
The talent lost in one year compares to when UCLA’s Russell Westbrook and Kevin Love, Stanford’s Brook Lopez and Robin Lopez, Arizona’s Jerryd Bayless and USC’s O.J. Mayo were selected in the top half of the first round in 2008.
You just don’t replace big-time players like that overnight, and that leaves the Pac-12 conference wide open for the Trojans to take advantage.
I’m not saying USC won’t miss Vucevic, but with these players leaving, it certainly helps the Trojans’ chances next year.
Although USC loses more than half its team, it should be better because of it.
Rather than watching USC dump the ball to Vucevic in the post and watching him operate, we will probably see a well-rounded team, instead of a one-man offensive show.
Sophomore forward Curtis Washington, who played sparingly last season, figures to have a much bigger role. Sophomore forward Garret Jackson will also be relied upon as one of the few returners who actually played minutes in coach Kevin O’Neill’s short rotation last year.
I never quite figured out why Washington never really played last season, especially with Stepheson suffering from a bout of fumble-itis the entire year. Next year, Washington just needs to catch the ball about half the time and shoot better than about 40 percent at the free-throw line, and that shouldn’t be too difficult.
USC will also have forward Aaron Fuller, who was an All-Big Ten honorable mention at Iowa and redshirted last season. A set of Twin Towers in seven-footers DeWayne Dedmon and James Blasczyk will debut at the Galen Center next year as well.
Although USC’s frontcourt will be very inexperienced, the number of big bodies provides the team with a number of options to turn to, and it also solves one glaring problem USC struggled with last season: depth.
And if you’re wondering where the offense will come from, there is no need to worry.
O’Neill’s defensive philosophy gives USC the opportunity to be in almost every game. Sure, it might be ugly basketball at times, but I believe in the old addage that defense wins championships.
The Trojans’ prized recruit for next season is forward Byron Wesley. The swingman from Etiwanda High is one of the top wing-types on the west coast, according to ESPN.com.
With an influx of youth and talent coming in, next season doesn’t look so bad after all, and despite what people say, they will not finish in ninth place in the Pac-12 conference. Couple that with knowing that most of the elite players in the former Pac-10 are gone, and USC has reason to believe it can compete for a conference title.

The Daily Trojan sat down with senior center Kari LaPlante to discuss her experiences with the team and her plans for after graduation.
 
Daily Trojan:  How does the USC women’s basketball team work out in the off-season?
Swan song · Senior center Kari LaPlante helped lead the USC women’s basketball team to the WNIT finals in her last season with the program. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
Kari LaPlante: We just started up post-season individual workouts. There’s lots of skill-based workouts that we have stations for like shooting, dribbling and post touches. We do some conditioning as well. During the summer, the coaches can’t make us do any individual workouts, but they give us packets with skill sets to work  on. Also, the players usually get together to play five on five pickup games twice a week.
 
DT: What changes has USC coach Michael Cooper made to the offseason workout program since taking over before the 2009-2010 season?
LaPlante: Well, under the old coaching staff, we didn’t have postseason workouts at all. [But] last year, right after spring break, six days after our last loss, we came back and started working out. We were all like, “What?” But I think it helped us a lot.
 
DT: Can you reflect on your four years on the team?
LaPlante: It’s been a great four years. I love all the girls — they’re like family to me. I’m going to miss them, especially all the little inside jokes that go on behind closed doors. I’ve been blessed to be able to play at USC, even with the coaching changes. I’ve been able to experience different things each year.
 
DT: What was different about this year?
LaPlante: I was a team captain this year, so I played a bigger role for the team. As a captain, you want to push your teammates like a coach does. I tried to lead by example and become more of a vocal leader. I don’t know if that was because I was a captain or because I was a senior, but there was definitely a change in my mentality and how I approached everything.
 
DT: Do you have any regrets from your time on the team?
LaPlante: No, not at all. My first three years, I didn’t get to participate in the postseason workouts because of injuries. But those injuries helped me become stronger, mentally and physically. All the ups and downs have helped me grow as a person.
 
DT: What’s the most memorable game from your time at USC?
LaPlante: The WNIT championship [this season]. It was an amazing experience. There was so much energy and excitement, it was unbelievable. It would’ve been nice to win it, but not many people get to experience a championship game. I didn’t get to once in high school. I’ve been very blessed that I was able to play in a championship game.
 
DT: What do you plan to do after graduation?
LaPlante: I’ve hired an agent, so I’m going to try and play basketball overseas somewhere in Europe.

USC interim head coach Frank Cruz is a jokester.
Ask him what has caused the Trojan pitching staff’s recent dominance, and says it’s because he took over pitching coach duties. Ask him about junior right fielder Alex Sherrod, who is six for his last 12 with six RBIs, and he’ll tell you to ask the lefty why he can’t hit the ball to the opposite field.
Hello Seattle · Junior right fielder Alex Sherrod leads the Trojans, winners of five of their last six contests, against last-place Washington. Sherrod has been instrumental during USC’s mid-season surge, driving in six runs in his last 12 at bats. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
“My last 10 at-bats or so, I’ve hit the ball within like three feet of the foul line,” Sherrod said with a smile. “All my hits have been right down the line; I’ve grounded out to the first baseman a bunch.”
Sherrod has spearheaded the Trojans’ (16-20, 6-6) recent run, during which they have won six-of-eight. Today, they look to keep that momentum alive, as they start a three game series at Washington.
The Huskies (11-23, 2-7) were picked to finish last in the Pac-10 coming into the season, and are currently tied for last in the conference. USC took two of three from Washington last year, but the Huskies have won four straight over the Trojans in Seattle, including a sweep two years ago.
“They always play well at home,” Cruz said. “That field up there is a bit of a different surface. It takes some getting used to.”
Though the outfield at Husky Ballpark is natural grass, the infield is made of FieldTurf. Only the mound and home plate area have actual dirt. Given the weather in Seattle, it cuts down on field maintenance, but it also makes for a slightly different game.
“It’s a little slower,” Cruz said. “You’ve really gotta spank the ball to hit it through that infield.”
The slow infield should help a Trojan pitching staff that has dominated the last two weekends.
Junior starter Andrew Triggs went seven strong innings two weeks ago against then-No. 11 Stanford, then dealt six and two-third innings of two-run ball last Friday against Oregon, striking out nine while walking just two.
“Triggs is looking a lot more confident,” Cruz said. “Hopefully he’s over that hump, because he was struggling earlier in the year.”
Triggs has been overshadowed, however, by the Trojans’ back-end starters. Junior righthander Austin Wood has thrown 14 and one-third innings in his last two starts, allowing just one run while recording 13 strikeouts and four walks.
But both Triggs and Wood have been outshined by the Trojans’ final starter, Logan Odom. The senior leads the starting rotation with a 2.80 ERA, good for third-best on the team. In his last four games, he’s posted a 1.71 ERA.
“We expect some good pitching on both sides this weekend,” Cruz said. “They’ve got this lefty they’ll throw on Thursday, and we haven’t hit lefties too well this year.”
Washington hasn’t hit well against lefties or righties as of late. In its last four Pac-10 games they’ve scored just seven runs, hitting just .195 in that stretch. Including their three and four run “outbursts” in their two Pac-10 wins over Oregon, the Huskies have scored just 20 runs in their nine conference games.

Studies over the years have found that sugar, in all of its  forms, isn’t all that healthy.
High-fructose corn syrup, in particular, has fallen from its lofty place as a healthy alternative to cane sugar. Now, it resides in the most vilified pits of the food world, the monstrous foe of nearly everyone focused on health and food.
Many people now go out of their way to buy products with regular sugar, not only because the flavor is better but also because people take some assurance that they’re not consuming an artificial, refined product (nevermind the irony that cane sugar is refined as well).
But an article published last week in The New York Times Magazine, titled “Is Sugar Toxic?,” presents some newer claims, among them that HFCS is no worse than ordinary refined sugar and that all forms of sugar might be toxic — not just fattening, but poisonous for our bodies.
These are some intense claims. Refined cane or beet sugars, otherwise known as sucrose, are chemically composed of two molecules, fructose and glucose, in equal parts. HFCS, though much sweeter than regular refined sugar, is still only 55 percent fructose, with the remaining 45 percent nearly all glucose.
Both break down into fructose and glucose in our systems and affect us the same when eaten. In that sense, it really doesn’t matter what type of sugar you eat — it’s pretty much the same thing.
This concept has been thoroughly researched by scientists like Luc Tappy of the University of Lausanne, widely considered one of the top biochemists in the field of fructose study. For now, HFCS and regular sugar are essentially the same.
Don’t sigh in relief yet, though, because that’s exactly the problem: HFCS and refined sugar are essentially the same, and the fructose in both might be the factor that, when metabolized, creates health risks beyond just “empty” calories.
The major argument against sugar has been about its empty calories, calories that simply make you fatter, without really providing nutrients. It makes sense, of course.
Sugar has been around forever, and it seems our skyrocketing consumption of sugar in the last 20 or 30 years has been the main connection between sugars and serious health problems like diabetes.
But new research suggests consuming sugar is exposing us to more fructose, which encourages fat development in our livers, which can lead to fatty liver disease, hepatitis, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.
And the latter can lead to increased levels of insulin floating around in our system, which new reports suggest could encourage cancer cell growth.
Getting fatter because of sugar consumption is a given. Letting yourself binge on Cokes and Twinkies usually has visible and relatively rapid effects: A little pudginess here and there, maybe physical lethargy, maybe less muscle definition. It’s something we can track.
But fat deposits in our livers? Not so much.
And the scary part is although a fatty liver can happen in fatter people, it happens in slimmer bodies, as well.
And sugar consumption might be part of the problem.
“Sugar scares me,” Lewis Cantley, director of the Cancer Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center told The New York Times Magazine.
Should it scare us too? Time will tell. But until then, sugar consumption — high-fructose, cane or otherwise — might deserve a second thought.
 
Eddie Kim is a sophomore majoring in print journalism. His column, “Food As Life,” runs Thursdays. 
Sugar in any form,  is dangerous in large quantities. Clearly, it wouldn’t be in anyone’s best interest to be eating cakes and pies and cookies for their daily meal, even if they were to burn it off rather quickly. It’s still taxing to both the liver and the pancreas’ insulin producing cells. And constantly producing insulin is not a good thing. 
On that note, the demonizing of HFCS is misdirected. Table sugar, honey, agave, maple syrup have nearly as much fructose as HFCS. HFCS did contribute to the obesity epidemic and diabetes, but only in an indirect way. It made processed food cheaper which eventually contributed to a dramatic increase in total food consumption since the 70s. But blaming “chemicals” per se, really is a scapegoat. We have to be looking at modern lifestyles and activity to get to the root of obesity, rather than blaming the man-made sugars. 
We know that our problems are directly related to physical activity and consumption. It’s the pink elephant in the room as we try to find a quick easy answer rather than doing the hard work to stay healthy.
The headline doesnt match the content of the article.  I know of no evidence, and certainly there is none presented here, that sugars like glucose, lactose, or maltose are dangerous or toxic.  In fact, it would be pretty senseless to say glucose is toxic, since we literally cannot survive without glucose in our system.
Poor journalism.

Human beings are constantly looking for happiness.
Project Happiness, a 62-minute documentary, seeks to provide some guidance.
Producer Randy Taran documents a small group of high school students from Watsonville, Calif. as they to search answer the burning question: What makes lasting happiness?
Interweaving confessional interviews and home video-esque footage of the students’ travels, the film makes for an authentic portrayal of their journey from California to India, where they gain the “ultimate understanding” of happiness from the Dalai Lama.
Although the film’s focus is centered on the American students, students from Nigeria and students from the Tibetan Children Village also participate in finding the key to happiness.
In on-camera interviews, the students  explain the experiences that made them unhappy, including divorce, poverty, adoption, death and illness.
Footage is often traded for text that addresses the problems and  fills the screen with warnings against the increase in depression and suicide rates among young adults.
By including statistics from Center for Disease Control, the film becomes more of a health informational video than a serious documentary.
The figures and numbers, though alarming, disconnect the viewer from the personal journey of the students.
To gain a better understanding of how happiness is achieved, the American students also meet with filmmaker George Lucas, actor Richard Gere, neuroscientist Richard Davidson and the Dalai Lama.
How Taran chose Lucas as an interviewee is unclear. One minute students are in the classroom, the next they are sitting in a room at the Skywalker Ranch spitballing on the philosophy of happiness.
The style of the documentary changes from a confessional interview to a more professional setting where students and Lucas speak in turns.
Despite the faux practicality of the meeting, the dialogue between Lucas and the students proves a redeeming moment for the film, as Lucas eloquently responds to their inquiries defining happiness as the “result of pleasure and joy.”
An eerily calm Gere, on the other hand, explains how he played religion roulette to find a “system” as part of his personal discovery of happiness. Gere has been a Buddhist for more than a decade.
Stepping back from the philosophical dialogue, students examine the scientific reasons for creating happiness in an interview with Davidson.
Davidson cites new research showing that brain cells can change in response to experiences, that contribute to the development of happiness.
Soon after, students are on a plane to India to meet the Dalai Lama, and their journey begins to resemble the plot of Elizabeth Gilbert’s book Eat, Pray, Love.
Throughout the documentary, “helping others” is purported to be one of the keys to happiness. So when the students visit an orphanage in India, the film drives the point home.
Smiling faces and laughter become a manifestation of inner joy, despite the orphans’ poverty.
The moment is one of the most authentic in the film.
The students then speak with the Dalai Lama, in a meeting which Taran claims was possible through a simple phone call.
But this information leaves the viewer filled with consternation, as it seems nearly impossible to be true.
Nonetheless, the Dalai Lama is a captivating character, using humor and wisdom to answer one of the most profound questions facing humankind.
The students are so moved by the conversation with the Dalai Lama several start crying, a producer’s dream come true.
The film takes a turn as students come to find out the Dalai Lama doesn’t know the key to happiness, only elements of it.
All in all, the trip proves that no one truly knows how to achieve happiness.
Project Happiness is a journey applicable not only to graduating high school students, but people of all ages.
The concept, although well intentioned and eye-opening, is executed with amateur efforts and a disconnecting narrative perhaps too idealistic for the average viewer.
The documentary is awesome. I have seen it.

Song of the Week — Lenka’s “Two”
Former child actress Lenka’s latest album, Two, was released April 19 and its titular track is folksy, catchy and even includes some electronic elements in the background. Her clean, honest vocals smoothly create the line two is the one for me and prove her latest release shows serious promise. The bubbly tune from this New Zealand songwriter is easy to listen to and has the potential to turn any frown upside down.

News of the Week — Rise of the Planet of the Apes (to be released in August)
The late 1960s introduced moviegoers to a planet run entirely by sinister, intelligent apes. Then the story came back to life in 2001 in Tim Burton’s adaptation. Now, the story is back again with a twist, whether moviegoers like it or not. James Franco will star as a scientist who makes the wrong discovery and boosts apes’ intelligence in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The trailer is riddled with shots of frightened people and chaos-creating apes who trash a business and break into people’s homes. The movie is set to release Aug. 5.

Is it right to deceive someone to protect them from the truth?
This question is explored in Peter S. Feibleman’s play, Tiger Tiger Burning Bright.
Tiger Tiger Burning Bright
Produced by Upward Bound Productions and directed by Sam Nickens, the play tells the story of the Morrises, a troubled black family living in 1950s Louisiana.
The Morrises are caught in a mesh of secrets and lies, and as the deceptive web begins to unravel, the audience begins to learn who the members of this family really are.
Tiger Tiger Burning Bright is an investigation into dreams, and what happens when dreams become delusions.
Encapsulating and engaging, the performance flew by, despite the slow beginning.
The New Orleans heat and rain, the atmosphere of the neighborhood, and the tension and humor of the Morris family all combine to create a vivid atmosphere.
The story centers around Mama (Regina Randolph), her two sons, Clarence (Damien Burke) and Dan (Richard John Reliford), and her daughter Cille (DaShawn Barnes), who all live together in the same New Orleans house.
Mama is the emotional anchor of the family. Clarence is cheeky and rebellious, with an air of secrecy about him.
Clarence’s little brother, Dan, is in love with a girl who would never notice him, but swoons over Clarence.
During the course of the play, Clarence is overly secretive about his whereabouts and income sources, and soon Cille and Mama begin to question him.
Conflicts come to a boiling point as secrets threaten to destroy the Morris family.
Conflicts appear authentic as the acting as a whole was convincing and managed to avoid being overly dramatic.
The confrontational scenes between Mama and Clarence were particularly engaging and riveting, and a romance between Cille and neighbor Dewey (Collin St. Dic) was helplessly charming.
A few characters seemed to lose themselves in longer monologues, but Barnes was excellent in her solo parts.
The simple yet undeniably Southern clothing help to set the tone of this performance.
The men wore conservative button-down collar shirts and slacks, while the women displayed an array of floral dresses.
Similarly, the set design was simple, but effective.
A kitchen occupied most of the stage space, with a small outside space and two doors into inner parts of the house allowing for lots of movement and surprising depth in an unchanging set.
The only potential miscue is a strange performance by Reliford.
Although the character is supposed to be silly, Reliford seems almost too goofy for this play.
Dan’s character seemed a bit off for what should have been very dramatic scenes.
On the whole, Tiger was a captivating performance, propelled by strong writing and an excellent cast.
The play is showing at the Stella Adler Theatre in Hollywood, a surprisingly intimate theatre nestled among the buzz of Hollywood Boulevard and will run through May 22.

When I was first an opinion editor, way back in the spring of aught-nine, I learned the number one rule in dealing with writers: Don’t let them write goodbye columns.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
This is the cardinal sin of schmaltz, allowing writers to wax nostalgic for 650 words on their last appearance in the paper.
The really smug writers will write smarmy, self-aware goodbye columns, which briefly acknowledge the transgression before cleverly misdirecting readers with a funny turn of phrase.
Underpants.
Of course, I learned other things too.
Unless you’re a fantastic writer, it’s best to put the opinion up front, the call to action in the last paragraph and sprinkle phrases like “Sisyphean battle,”  “cavalier disregard” or “transgression” throughout.
I also learned by reading other Daily Trojan writers. For example, trying to be funny or clever is a slippery slope, because there are very few Laura Reeves or Mike Middlehurst-Schwartzes in the world, and most of us are, sadly, not them.
Most importantly, I learned the simple fact that USC needs the Daily Trojan, though it might not like to admit it.
In my four years with the paper, the DT has faced the ire of the Greek community, feminists, Democrats, Republicans and the violently apathetic, to name a few.
It’s the lot of college media to draw more heat than most student organizations, comparable, perhaps, only to Undergraduate Student Government in terms of backlash.
Anonymous online commenters accuse college papers of bias, ineptitude or laziness, (I’ve personally gotten “frivolous drivel,” which is admirable for its assonance if nothing else), without realizing the students who run the paper are putting in 50-hour work weeks and taking their precious few naps with the Associated Press Stylebook as a pillow.
The DT is not without its flaws. As it became more and more obvious that people who worked primarily within the print model were being viewed as beeper salesmen or telegraph editors, the Daily Trojan website underwent a huge overhaul, and its online presence has been building for several years now. But there is still a long way to go before our digital journalism matches the print counterpart.
And the Daily Trojan is run by humans. Students, to be specific — overworked, underpaid students — doing the job for sheer love of the paper or stark raving lunacy.
In the end, however, the Daily Trojan is the reporter and commentator for the university, one of several fine campus news publications, but the only print one.
Because of this, the DT is in a unique position. Universities are the only niche markets in the country where print journalism is thriving.
The DT covers a small but specific perview relevant to some 40,000 students, with a circulation of more than 10,000, (up 1,000 from last year).
The Daily Trojan has a rich history.
This is the first newspaper in the country to interview Richard Nixon after his resignation.
This is the paper that had reporters on the streets during the Los Angeles riots to put out an extra issue, even though the paper had already closed up shop for the semester. (Incidentally, the Daily Trojan won the Pacemaker award that year, the highest honor in college journalism.)
This is the paper that broke the news of Obama’s visit to campus last semester.
This is the paper that has been ranked in the top three California college newspapers for the last two years by the California College Media Association.
Hell, this is the paper whose staff beat the Daily Bruin’s for 13 consecutive years in flag football.
I know what you’re thinking —does it hurt my back to kiss my own ass like this?
The DT is not above criticism. In fact, the paper needs to be criticized to continue to improve.
Even though the caliber of our students has risen exponentially in the last decade, at times it seems the student body is still in the fetal stage in terms of argumentary skills.
Not happy with university happenings? Write petitions, form protests, send letters to administrators. (Join Facebook groups too, but know that one doesn’t take the place of the other). Disagree with the Daily Trojan? Send a letter, drop by the office.
Or better yet: Apply to work for us. At the risk of sounding too much like The West Wing, we want good writers who disagree.
It’s time to raise the level of debate on campus — outside our newsroom,  and within.

daily trojan is a garbage paper
anonymous hater comments are SO much better
Great article! Sad to see you go.
People are not criticizing the hours put in to making the paper, but the quality of some of the end product. Why traipse all the way to Hollywood to review plays when there are good ones on campus? Why not cover some of the speaker talks in the Center for International Studies? Why not cover more of life as a staff member here at USC? As a grad student? As a professor? Living near USC- what are residents’ opinions of us?
And some of the opinion columns are quite *ahem* variable.
Too long, didn’t read

Eight a.m. is not most students’ favorite time of day.
It’s painful to have class at that time because it means waking up almost before the sun. It means not being able to stay up too late the night before. It means breakfast alone.
We need as much sleep as possible during these last critical weeks of the semester, but the structure of life at USC doesn’t make it easy for students to get rest.
On weekends, residential dining halls do not open until 10 a.m. The earliest classes begin around the same time most high schools start, while most classes and meetings don’t begin until the late afternoon or evening.
The plethora of 24-hour restaurants in the USC vicinity also encourages students to pay no heed to the time of day.
With all these forces encouraging a nocturnal schedule, it is no surprise students go to sleep later and later.
This behavior, though, is more injurious than helpful, especially for students with academic ambitions, according to Harvard University.
Lower levels of anxiety and depression as well as better academic performance were found in “day scholars” versus those who studied primarily at night. A study conducted by the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard confirmed this.
Though we might think it doesn’t matter exactly when a person sleeps as long as he gets a substantial amount of sleep, evidence suggests going to sleep earlier is perhaps even more important than the number of hours of sleep, according to a study by Kyushu University professor Kiyoshi Adachi.
The problem students face, though, is applying those lessons to their lives in a collegiate atmosphere, which is almost tailored to encourage staying up and waking up late.
Given that the majority of students are not early risers (8 a.m. sections usually aren’t the most popular scheduling choices), waking up early by choice has almost become taboo.
The university can make a variety of efforts to help promote an early to bed, early to rise schedule.
By providing many night classes, the university is doing itself, and its students, no favors. What it can do, however, is make a more reasonable schedule more attainable.
The university can take simple steps in the right direction by making sure that the dining halls open earlier on weekends, and that events on McCarthy Quad don’t run past midnight, and even by providing the tools and teaching necessary to instill an urgency about getting not only the right amount of sleep, but at the right time.
Until then, students should attempt to make important changes to their sleep schedules to improve their physical and mental lives.
There are many practical reasons for adapting an earlier rising and sleeping schedule, too.
Waking up early means lines in the dining hall are shorter so less time is spent waiting and more time is spent being productive.
The benefits of an earlier schedule don’t end at eating and studying, though. Early morning schedules are already practiced by many athletes here at USC, and for good reason.
Head football coach Lane Kiffin recently changed spring practices from evenings to early in the morning, a switch he believes benefits players both on and off the field.
A morning workout leaves room for a later workout. Plus, exercise can dispel the initial sleepiness that follows many students to their first classes.
Waking up early is unusual for the average college student, but it brings positive connotations; implying organization, punctuality and commitment, to name a few. These qualities will lead to a more fruitful college career, both academically and personally.
Wake up early and start the day off by reading a good book.
Time is your most valuable resource.
Perhaps it’s best to live by the words Robin Williams famously said in Dead Poets Society: “Seize the day.”

this article is worthless…. some people work and NEED night classes
get a life
get over yourself
stop writing terrible articles
I agree. if you need a good website to help you wake up early. try HowToGetUpEarly.
I found a way that helps me wake up on time every morning and after few weeks I even dont use my alarm clock.
I wake up naturally on time.
I don’t think any of us are expecting a job after college that allows us to work only 4 hours a day…that’s a ridiculous exaggeration. Having been required to take night classes for my major without having a choice though, I will say that it does wreak havoc on my sleeping schedule, eating schedule and makes it damn near impossible to get work done when I get home. Especially when the classes run straight through dinner time and are 3 or 4 hours long.
While I do think we can’t all decide to be lazy as student, I think most of the people with these complaints aren’t necessarily lazy…some of us are very hard-working and find it frustrating to live, work and learn in an atmosphere that doesn’t facilitate healthy sleep habits. I have doctors in one ear telling me that I really need to improve my sleeping habits, students who dont understand that concept all around me, and professors expecting me to conjure up miracles in between classes when they take up a ton of my usable working time IN class!
I actually think what would be more important than making less things 24 hours, etc, would be holding professors to a higher standard of making class time productive, and not including attendance as a part of the grade…you either get your work done and pass the tests, quizzes and activities, or you don’t. Period.
I’d be a lot less peeved about getting home from class at 10:30pm if I didn’t feel like I just wasted my time sitting through a 3-hour  mandatory lecture that could have been taught in an hour, while I could have been doing other things at home like getting my work done, and oh, applying for one of those lovely jobs you’re referring to.
Oh and also, we are PAYING to go here…so while its important to respect our professors, I think it’s ridiculous that I should have to pay to sit through a class when I can learn the material on my own in half the time. Stop making attendance a part of the grade-we’re not kids anymore. If your lectures are worth attending, then people will show up–either because they’ll fail the test without it, or because you are a professor who is a joy to learn from and provides students with a valuable experience. If not, then step your game up–don’t start forcing students to attend a class if they’re not getting something out of it. If I want to skip, let me skip, and if there are consequences I’ll suffer them. If there aren’t consequences, well then someone needs to rethink their lesson plan.
while I do agree that classes can be annoying if the material is dry and non-applicable to life, I still think that as US college students, we have it relatively easy. I doubt if you go anywhere else in the world that the students there will be complaining about the time of their classes. It is expected to be difficult. Besides, are you so sure that it is the professors creating these time tables for class all of the time? If you’re going to spread blame, spread it to all that it is due. Yes I agree that attendance shouldn’t be mandatory, those that will go to lecture, will go to lecture. I’m not saying that students are lazy, I’m just saying that it is necessary to realize that if we are complaining about the length of the day now we’re going to have problems later. I mean people who want to be doctors getting off whenever they want to? It really isn’t all that likely that we’ll be able to dictate when we want to work. That’s all i’m saying.
Until some brilliant physicist comes up with some means of producing more time, or stretching out the illusion that we call “morning” or “nighttime,” this is a non-issue. Sometime life means waking up early, staying up late and functioning on less hours of sleep while doing things we would prefer not to; this is the essence of growing up, the thing that so many students avoid. Do we actually think that after college out jobs are going to allow us to wake up at 10, go to work at 11, take lunch at 12 and leave at 4, before it gets dark? I mean, really…I hate to be so critical, but there are more pertinent issues to worry about and we should pick our battles with the university. Wasting our time on stupid stuff like class is too early or too late will make our later, more important request ignorable…
i think that this only supports what the author is saying.  you say that not getting enough sleep is just part of life, part of growing up.  says who?  you say that because that is how our society is built?  because that is what we see others doing?  that’s pretty much what he is getting at when he points to ways in which usc supports this kind of sleep schedule.
Says who? Because we actually have stuff to do and these 8 am and 10 pm classes enable people to do that. What I am saying is that this article highlights the main point that USC students are spoiled. From Junior High School on I had 7 am classes and I know others had as well. Believing that the University should force its employees, like those at the dinning hall, to wake up earlier just to accommodate those who don’t want to make their own breakfast in the morning, is indicative of this spoiled attitude. If I didn’t have my 8am classes, I wouldn’t be as far as I am with my classes, since I have to work and commute back and forth to school. The schedule of classes that USC provides may irk some, but it is vital to the rest of us.

Blink-182 announced that it has been working on its new record since they reformed in February of 2009. Since then, the band has complete one tour of the United States, and European fans were expecting to get to see the band this summer.
The band announced Monday, however, that it will  be cancelling the tour because the recording of the album was not going as planned.
In a statement on the band’s website, it declared “When we booked the tour last year, we were confident that we would have the new album out before the Summer. Turns out we were mistaken as the album is taking longer than we thought and won’t be out till later this year.”
With bassist Mark Hoppus hosting his own television show on Fuse, Tom Delonge fronting the arena rock band Angels & Airwaves and Travis Barker working on and touring in support of his solo project, it is no surprise that the band has not been able to complete the new album.
Nonetheless, fans are upset at the lack of effort the band seems to be putting forth. Users on the website absolutepunk.net feel the band’s hearts are not in making music for Blink-182 and are instead focusing on their side projects. The band has yet to release new material since its reunion.
Bliink-182 has rescheduled the tour dates for the summer of 2012 and is promising to perform new material whenever it decides to tour.
