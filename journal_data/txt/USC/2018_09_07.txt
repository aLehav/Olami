The No. 10 USC women’s volleyball team travels to Milwaukee for the Marquette Invitational, where they will play No. 3 Brigham Young University before taking on No. 25 Marquette and Syracuse.
The Trojans are coming off a somewhat strange three-game stretch at the Bubly Invitational that saw them best No. 4 Florida, led by sophomore outside hitter Brooke Botkin’s 20 kills and 15 digs, before being upset by unranked UCF in four sets. USC bounced back with a clean three-game sweep of Louisville, with Botkin and junior outside hitter Emily Baptista both recording 11 kills apiece. Although both Florida and USC finished 2-1, USC claimed the championship title with their victory acting as the tie breaker. However, the two wins weren’t enough to prevent USC from sliding down three spots in the top 25 rankings. 
Freshman setter Raquel Lázaro has been named Pac-12 Freshman of the Week for the second straight week. In each of the three games, Lázaro had 41, 42 and 38 assists, respectively, while also registering her second double-double of the year against UCF with 10 digs. Junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier was named tournament MVP, with a total of 42 kills and 23 digs. Botkins and Lázaro joined her on the All-Tournament Team. 
“[Lanier] and [Botkin] on the outside, and our new setter [Lázaro], just did a great job this weekend,” head coach Brent Crouch said. “I think we’re going to unleash them once we get some new habits in place, different movement patterns, and they figure out how to run the kind of offense we want to run, the defense we want to do. It’s all based on reading, so it takes a little while to figure out the read situations.”
USC’s surprising loss to UCF may be due to them looking ahead to the championship game and overlooking UCF after their excellent win against Florida. With the teams in the Marquette tournament sporting a combined 17-2 record, the Trojans can’t afford to do that again. Crouch said he wants to focus on dictating the flow of the offense to gain control of the game early on.
“We’re trying to run an offense that’s fast, and we’re trying to run it fast from situations that aren’t necessarily perfect,” Crouch said. “What we mean by that is passes that aren’t necessarily perfect right in the net. It’s easy to run a fast offense when you’ve got a perfect first contact. It’s harder when things are being moved around a bit … to be able to have hitters that are able to read those kind of situations and then audible into certain playsets means we can still go fast from everywhere, and we really like that.”
BYU has already begun to show what they’re capable of, with a major win last week in the BYU Nike Invitational that saw the Cougars defeat West Virginia, No. 1 Stanford and Wichita State to maintain a perfect 5-0 record. Senior outside hitter Roni Jones-Perry had a fantastic outing that saw her go for 13 kills and six digs against West Virginia, a 20-kill and 10-dig double-double against Stanford and a match-high 16 kills on a career-best .682 hitting percentage against Wichita State. Jones-Perry was named tournament MVP and the AVCA player of the week for her outstanding performance.
“If we have middle blockers like we have right now in the middle, I think we can get multiple blockers up all over the place, no matter where the set is,” Crouch said, “That piece of the defense is gonna take the longest to get good at, because it’s the most complicated. We started off pretty well already blocking, but I think by the end of the season that’s going to be a major growth area.”

David Axelrod spoke about working with former President Barack Obama and the passing of the Affordable Care Act. (Raquel Greenberg | Daily Trojan)
The Center for the Political Future hosted its first installment of “Political Conversations” series on Thursday. The event featured David Axelrod, chief strategist and senior adviser during the Obama administration, in conversation with center director Bob Shrum.
The series invites noteworthy politicians and policy experts to converse on campus. 
Axelrod discussed how he became interested in politics, describing how a John F. Kennedy campaign rally in New York changed his vision.
“He started speaking and his voice was booming off of the buildings and everybody was watching with rapt attention,” Axelrod said. “It just seemed very important and very exciting to me.”
He also discussed his experience in journalism and his transition to political consulting. 
“[The Chicago Tribune] used to let me cover the candidate they thought would be the losing candidate,” Axelrod said. “One of them happened to be Jane Byrne, a woman running for mayor [of Chicago] — nobody gave her a chance and I ended up covering her. She won. And they gave me the political beat.”
Axelrod then spoke about campaigning for Barack Obama in 2008.
“I’ve never seen anybody who handles adversity and setbacks as well as he did,” Axelrod said. “One of the reasons he got elected was because people … were looking for someone who was more reflective, someone who saw the nuances in the world and in politics and someone … [who had] a desire for thoughtfulness.”
When discussing Obama’s legacy, including the Affordable Care Act, Axelrod told the story of his daughter, Lauren, who started having seizures when she was seven months old. Her medication was expensive and her insurance would not cover the cost, Axelrod explained.
“When the Affordable Care Act passed, I was crying because I knew that there were families who wouldn’t have to go through what my family went through,” Axelrod said. “I said thank you … and [Obama] put his arms on my shoulder and he said, ‘That’s why we do the work.’”
Axelrod also discussed the problems with the 2016 election — specifically what he considered to be problems with the Clinton campaign. 
“I think a message was sent [by the Clinton campaign] that [they] had young people, minorities and women, so the working class white folks weren’t needed,” Axelrod said. “That just abetted Trump’s message and played into his hands.”
The next “Political Conversation” is scheduled for Oct. 2 with Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary under Bill Clinton, and Jon Macks, a writer on late-night shows.

VoteSC and USG will be using TurboVote, an app that helps to register voters to decrease voting barriers and increase access to voting. (Adriana Sanchez | Daily Trojan)
USC is facing UCLA once again. This time, they’re competing to see who can register the most voters before the midterm elections this November.
The last time Bruins faced Trojans in voter registration, USC’s rivals won the friendly competition after registering over 10,000 voters compared to USC’s mere 411.
The second annual competition began Tuesday to encourage students at both universities to vote in the upcoming elections. 
VoteSC, a coalition of students focused on voter education, registration and civic engagement and the Unruh Institute of Politics are co-sponsoring the competition to increase the number of students registered in California by Oct. 22, the registration deadline.
VoteSC co-chair Eleonora Viotto, who is helping plan the voter registration drive and competition, said USC has lower percentages of registered voters than other campuses its size, with an approximate 15 percent voting rate for all students in the last election and 8 percent for undergraduates. 
“No matter what political perspective you may have, if our generation had turned up to vote in 2016, it would have been a very different election,” Viotto said. 
VoteSC and the Undergraduate Student Government will be using TurboVote to help students engage in the voting process. According to USG Director of External Affairs Alec Vandenberg, the program will help all eligible student voters register to vote and head to the polls in November. After students enter their information and voter registration status, the platform can help them register to vote but also apply for an absentee ballot or receive election reminders online, making voting easier for all students on campus. 
“There’s a lot of voting barriers,” Vandenberg said. “We know there was a lot of lack of accessibility, so we just wanted to make sure the process was simple and easy so everyone can just make sure they can do their civic duty.”
Vandenberg said the organizations will host “Midterm Monday” each week with a table on Trousdale to inform students of the competition and answer any questions they may have about the voting process in person.
On Sept. 25, National Voter Registration Day, VoteSC will hold its largest voter registration events by Tommy Trojan. Viotto said the coalition also hopes to include some incentives this day like an  In-N-Out Burger truck to encourage students to vote with a celebration focused on voter engagement.
Jamie Kennerk, a senior at UCLA, assisted with the 2016 voter registration competition. She said she hopes this year’s edition helps educate students on important information and deadlines. 
“I hope it manages to actually give students another reason to want to be involved in voting,” Kennerk said. “There definitely is a solid USC-UCLA campus spirit that goes on, and I think it can help students see that voting is not necessarily this dry, boring thing that you do, but is exciting and important.”
Vandenberg added that he thinks the voting competition and various on-campus events will lead more students to want to vote. He said he hopes this voter registration campaign will help more USC students see the importance of civic engagement and community and political involvement.
“We always hear the stereotypes of [USC] not being civically aware or engaged, and I think that’s a perception that both [Viotto and I] wanted to change, especially with an election season coming up again,” Vandenberg said. “So we wanted to make it very clear that every single year is crucial for civic engagement and that this can be a sort of point in time in which USC can change its trajectory and have its students more engaged in the community and politics and beyond.”

The site’s developers were inspired by their high school friend and SoundCloud musician who approached them in August 2017 who wanted a strong platform to help him distribute his music to the public. (Photo courtesy of David Yoon)
This past summer, junior business students David Yoon and John Depriest launched an entrepreneurial venture — Jive, a live-streaming platform for musicians to perform and receive feedback and donations in real time. 
Yoon and Depriest teamed up with three UCLA students with the shared mission of helping musicians make more profit. For the most part, the development and coding aspects are headed at UCLA while Yoon and Depriest handle the business components of the start-up.
“We like to have musicians come in and perform really intimate studio  -— we’re not trying to have concerts streaming,” Yoon said. “We’re trying to keep the fact that an audience can interact with the artist and vice versa, and the best way of doing that is through small intimate sessions, like you’re set up in your home studio on your bedrooms with your webcam on your computer  and jam out in that kind of environment.”
Yoon and Depriest came across this problem in the music industry after Elias DeFaria, their close high school friend and a SoundCloud musician, approached them in August 2017. Aside from SoundCloud, DeFaria didn’t have a strong platform to distribute his music and didn’t know how to pursue a career without profit. To help their friend, Yoon and Depriest began forming the website this past spring.
According to Depriest, no one on the team had experience starting a business. A few of the members had small projects, but none had embarked on a project as big as Jive. Throughout the creation process, they faced many difficulties entering the entrepreneurial world and learning how to work with the livestream platform being used. 
Depriest explained that due to the nature of the platform, it’s important to get the musician and viewer on the platform at the same time.
Another concern Jive had was with copyright issues and possibly receiving donations from performing covers; however, with advice from Georgiana Nikias, an associate of the litigation department at law firm Eisner, they were able to overcome this challenge. Since their platform is a live-stream, musicians are protected from copyright infringement and are able to perform covers. 
Although the Jive team has launched their site, they’re taking steps to make the platform more interactive and specialized to host music. According to Depriest, some new ideas include inviting influencers to do a live-stream of their studio session, collaborations with other artists or hosting competitions where producers and artists collaborate to create a beat live over a weekend. 
“Our whole motivation is, ‘How can we help the musician the most?’ … through things like collaboration, competitions and just being able to give the artist every single chance they can possibly have to reach a larger audience, make money off doing it and find their niche,” Yoon said.

Slated for release on Sept. 14, James Stern’s “American Chaos” explores contemporary American politics. (Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics)
The pronoun “they” dates back to the 16th century: It can be used in the third person plural, the third person plural singular or  as a mode of self-identification. 
The notion of an opposing “they” shapes much of James D. Stern’s new documentary, “American Chaos,” which had a screening this Wednesday at the Ray Stark Family Theatre. 
The film seeks to explore the increasingly large chasm between “us” and “them” that has emerged amid the turbulent climate of American politics. Through the film, Stern tries to understand what drove political support for a man who appeared, to Stern, cosmically unprepared for the presidency — then-candidate Donald Trump. 
The film, distributed by Sony Pictures Classics, will be officially released in L.A. on Sept. 14, nearly two years after the 2016 election and two months before the 2018 midterms. 
Stern, the founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Endgame Entertainment, set out on the journey that became “American Chaos” six months prior to the 2016 presidential election. 
“I became more and more obsessed in 2016 with finding out ‘who’ the ‘they’ was. Who was fervently supporting Trump, who was such a radical departure from past elected presidents?” Stern wrote in his director’s statement. “I felt I had to go on the road and meet his supporters for myself, listen to them and in doing so, perhaps gain an appreciation for the truth under the surface.” 
While two years of impassioned post-election analysis have made Stern’s “truth under the surface” significantly less groundbreaking than its initial 2016 uncovering, the guiding mission behind “American Chaos” is a critical analysis of our contemporary political rhetoric: Who are “they?” And what does that make “us?” 
Stern begins answering this question in Florida, where Mar-a-Lago is “not as gold plated” as he expected and a former vice mayor of a mid-sized city an hour away compares the America of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan to that of 1957.  From there, Stern zig-zags around the country, making stops in Ohio, West Virginia and Arizona before returning to Florida for election night. Along the way, he interviews coal miners, border patrol officers, ranchers and one West Virginia man who suggests the death penalty for then-candidate Hillary Clinton. 
Some of the interviews are comic and some are polarizing; some humanizing and others politically insightful. Walking outside of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, however, Stern makes an observation that speaks for anyone who doesn’t identify as white or male: “It really feels like a white guy’s world, man.” 
Indeed, some of the most revealing scenes in “American Chaos” stem from this subtle, perhaps even accidental, commentary on the liberal deficit in predicting Trump’s rise. At an L.A. viewing party of Trump and Clinton’s second debate depicted in the middle of the documentary, one party guest featured in the scene feebly commented: “She did fine.” 
Stern’s documentary serves as a delayed response as to why Clinton ultimately didn’t. 
In a Q&A session following the screening, Stern clarified some points of contention, particularly among fellow blue-state dwelling Democrats who, Stern said, questioned his choice to give a platform to discordant Trump-supporting voices. 
“This is a culture war. It’s not about politics. It’s about culture,” Stern said. 
He called for an increased willingness to listen across party and ideological lines, in turn criticizing a polarized media landscape. 
“We’re able to dissect and only read the news that aligns with our viewpoints,” Stern said. 
His film serves as a healthy dose of discord. 
“In a documentary, you don’t know what you’re going to find,” Stern said. “You just keep going, one foot after another.”

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
A typical Sunday morning in the Mier household during my childhood consisted of my mom cooking up huevo con chorizo in the kitchen and my dad sitting in the living room watching Liga MX, the Mexican soccer league, in his pajamas.
Now that I’m away at college, things are a little different. But a soccer game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum this weekend allowed me to reminisce about my childhood love for Mexican soccer and how the sport forged an inseparable connection between me and my father, despite our differences.
This Sunday, the two biggest teams in Liga MX, Chivas de Guadalajara and Club América, face each other in a friendly match at the Coliseum. This matchup, to any educated fan, entails a battle on the field and stands that’ll most likely lead to multiple injuries and arrests.
Mexican soccer fans either hate or love one of these teams: there is no in-between and my dad is no exception.
As an avid Americanista, my dad wouldn’t miss a game, and as a result, neither would I. If América played at 3 p.m. on a Sunday and misa ended at 2:30 p.m, my dad would strategically sit closest to the door and would apurarnos as soon as the priest left the altar.
He’d rush us home and we’d sit to watch the game, listening to the starting lineups and analyzing the game formations. His passion for the game is unwavering, complete with commentary for every single play. 
Foul called? Pinche árbitro vendido. (Someone paid this f-cking ref.) Missed free kick? Esa hasta yo la meto. (Even I could’ve made that.) New midfielder not playing up to expectations? No sé pa’ qué se lo trajeron… no sirve pa’ nada. (I don’t understand why they bought him… he’s good for nothing.)
I absorbed the passion he exuded. I knew all the players’ names, their athletic strengths and the last three teams they’d played for. I’d sometimes blurt out facts to make my dad proud and let him know that I was paying keen attention.
My love for mi papá and for fútbol heavily influenced my career goals, leading me to want to be  a soccer journalist. I fantasized about appearing on my favorite soccer shows on the Spanish version of ESPN. I envisioned myself sharing my opinions at the roundtable discussion, and mi papá proudly watching from home.
My love for the game also took control of my style (I would wear indoor soccer shoes everyday) and other extra curricular activities (I volunteered at San Jose Earthquakes games). Even my day to day schedule revolved around soccer games to the point where I’d wake up at 5 a.m. on weekends to watch Chicharito and Manchester United play in the Premier League.
Now that I’m in college, I no longer follow soccer religiously, set my alarm to catch games or know the names of all of Club América’s new players. But I still love the sport and use it to spark conversations with my dad who — in stark opposition to my boisterous and talkative nature — is more quiet and reserved.
In retrospect, soccer was my escape from realities I didn’t want to deal with. I definitely used the sport (and the masculinity of its culture) to suppress my sexuality and the challenges that would come with admitting I am the gay son of Catholic Mexican immigrants.
I was never sure about my sexuality growing up, but looking back I always knew that something was “different” about me. Soccer was the only avenue through which I could internalize the notion that “I’m not gay because I like soccer” and my parents could tell themselves, “ He can’t be gay because he likes soccer.”
To this day, soccer allows me to continue bonding with my dad, even if he doesn’t fully understand what it means for his son to be gay and whether that affects our relationship. At the end of the day, my sexuality has nothing to do with our bond. He and I will always be close and will always share our love for América and for soccer, even if my sexual preferences aren’t the ones he would have chosen for me.
I’ll always be his son and I’ll always be an Americanista — gay or not.

Alfred Hitchcock’s “Rebecca” was based on the Gothic novel of the same name by Daphne Du Maurier. The story traces the haunted marriage of Maxim de Winter and his nameless young wife. (Photo from IMDb)
When School of Cinematic Arts professor Drew Casper was 14 years old, he was inexplicably the only person in his English class to be handed Daphne du Maurier’s Gothic novel “Rebecca.” To this day, he does not know why his teacher assigned him a different book; But he is grateful to have been introduced to the story of “Rebecca.” 
On Wednesday, guests from the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies at USC filed into the Norris Theater to hear Casper lecture on the motif of faith in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1940 adaptation of the novel. Toward the end of his lecture, he recalled his first encounter with the story in high school and remarked how his relationship with it has now come full circle, having understood at last why his English teacher selected a different novel for him. He refers to the incident as part of the “wonderful scheme of life,” and wonders aloud, “How can you say there is no God?” 
Published in 1938, “Rebecca” was an instant success. The eerie tale follows ‘Maxim’ de Winter (Laurence Olivier), a widower still reeling from his wife Rebecca’s death one year ago. Maxim decides to remarry a nameless young woman played by Joan Fontaine. As the new Mrs. de Winter comes into her role as housekeeper of the family’s grand estate, Manderlay, she cannot help but feel she is always being compared to the late Rebecca. Rebecca becomes the ghost in this haunting tale; she is never seen, but her presence is always felt. 
Wednesday’s lecture was overflowing with Casper’s contagious passion for a story that impacted him in his youth, but also one whose film adaptation carries themes of his own Catholic faith which he just so happens to share with Hitchcock, “the master of suspense.”
“[Hitchcock] arrives in New York City literally full of himself. He’s about 300 pounds,” Casper quipped as he began to expand the history behind “Rebecca.” Hitchcock had decided to settle in the United States permanently to further his filmmaking career during the late 1930s when many countries were consumed by war, resulting in the public’s fiery desire to attend movies as an escape. Though films were heavily censored by various religious organizations, Hitchcock snuck in an abundance of what was at the time considered censor-worthy material including mature themes of murder, suicide and abortion. 
“Hitchcock gets rid of one censorship problem to bring up two or three others … I still don’t know how he got he got away with that!” exclaimed Casper as he screened clips from the film. 
Casper expertly pointed out things most viewers would otherwise miss, but the filmmaker intended to be noticed. In “Rebecca,” the peculiar motifs of Catholicism hover in the background but are essential to the narrative. The film is named for someone who never actually appears on screen, but is brought to life by Hitchcock’s powerfully crafted images — this phenomenon, Casper says, is a reference to the Catholic belief in the resurrection of the dead. Hitchcock utilizes production design and camera movement to make the audience feel the presence of the deceased; it is a clear reference to the director’s faith in resurrection, an element essential to the film but often overlooked. 
Other elements of Catholicism present not only in “Rebecca” but in almost all of Hitchcock’s films are sin and confession. According to Casper, “In Catholicism, you commit sin by thought, word and deed, and so many of Hitchcock’s people are guilty of, not the deed, but the thought.” 
The characters’ need to release unbearable guilt through confession is also a clear reference to the Catholic faith; Casper pointed out that even the cramped set design in some of these scenes resembles a confessional booth. 
“Rebecca” is not a popular film in today’s cultural discourse, but for those in the Norris Theater on Wednesday night, it is now surely appreciated in all its proper glory. Casper compared “Rebecca” to the ever-acclaimed “Citizen Kane,” (1941) which was released one year after; both films share major themes, characterization and moments of cinematography. The biggest difference between these two films is that the latter is now considered the best film of all-time by many critics. Despite its critical praise, “Citizen Kane” is no more than a copycat of “Rebecca,” according to Casper would consider it. As he put it on Wednesday night, “I’m way above the critics.”

Grace Cillo | Daily Trojan
Starting Sunday, USC will participate in National Suicide Prevention Week, an annual campaign that will take place this year from Sept. 9 to 15, with two open discussion sessions on Sept. 10. The following week, the Engemann Student Health Center will begin its weekly, hour-long drop-in counseling sessions Mondays to Thursdays. 
Since the beginning of fall semester, USC Student Health has introduced new programming focused on mental health and wellness, from resident assistant support groups to weekly workshops. And while the University is making progress, this is only the first step to truly addressing suicide prevention on campus.
Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among college-age adults, after car accidents, according to The New York Times. The National College Health Assessment has found an alarming increase in depression and thoughts of suicide among college students in the last five years. In 2017, 40.2 percent of college students suffered from depression, almost 8 percent more than reported in 2013. What’s more, 11.5 percent reported thoughts of suicide and 1.7 percent reported a suicide attempt. Currently, a staggering 1 in 12 college students has a suicide plan. 
Given these shocking statistics, it is disappointing that the University is not taking substantive action beyond a few poorly advertised wellness sessions. Posting flyers and sending out mass emails are unlikely to urge students to use Health Center resources. 
Taking place the same week as USC’s roster of events, the University of Buffalo is also planning to take part in activities to mark National Suicide Prevention Week. In stark contrast, the University of Buffalo has planned a full week of events including an Out of the Darkness Walk for Suicide Prevention, a Wellness Activity Day, a screening of a documentary that chronicles the recovery of a suicide-attempt survivor and Suicide Prevention Training that will teach students to recognize the warning signs of suicide and ways to effectively help peers in need. 
The school’s website also includes links to make donations to the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention, with whom the university has partnered to organize the walk, and an online registration form to sign up for the training. 
USC’s offerings pale in comparison — both in quantity and quality. USC Student Health’s single promotional flyer for Suicide Prevention Week merely lists contact information for campus resources, an invitation to join a hashtag campaign and implores students to attend a drop-in discussion for an “interactive and informative [discussion] on this topic.” The vagueness of this description is hardly motivational or intriguing to students. A topic as heavy as suicide prevention cannot be discussed with trite buzzwords, without essential components like education and promoting wellness. 
While USC is at least doing something, its not doing enough to effectively engage students and provide them with pragmatic knowledge. Instead, its wellness initiatives are riddled with impracticalities that make mental health resources even more scarce and difficult to access. Drop-in counseling sessions will only last from 2:30 to 3:30 p.m., with only one counselor available each day. While this is certainly a respectable effort to increase access to counseling, it is also a half-baked Band-Aid solution that fails to ameliorate the greater issue of mental health on campus. Realistically speaking, only one student will be able to see a counselor each day for an appropriate-length talk through these drop-in sessions. The real solution to this issue, which has been covered extensively by the Daily Trojan, is to hire more mental health counselors to accommodate students’ needs. 
Like the University of Buffalo, we need to be combating the root of the issue by explicitly teaching wellness and educating students about the signs and ways to prevent suicide. A voluntary, hour-long “discussion” simply won’t suffice. Neither will leaving it up to the students to ask for help on their own accords — stigmas surrounding the act of seeking mental health support still exist and health and wellness professionals must take initiative in reaching out to students. 
Our campus is no stranger to suicide. As students — and members of the Trojan Family — we must remain vigilant. Our personal wellness and that of our peers is not trivial and must be taken more seriously by our administrators. Although their intentions are pure, it’s high time campus health professionals took a more innovative, engaging and personalized approach to suicide prevention education and demonstrate that they truly empathize with the needs of the student body. They need to go beyond illusory social media campaigns and spontaneous wellness conferences; they must actually reach out to students on campus, whether it be through tabling on Trousdale, going into classes to speak about health resources for five minutes at a time or organizing more comprehensive and consistent wellness activities. 
We at USC must not confine suicide prevention efforts to one week — we must do better as a school and as a community to nourish, protect and care for one another. In this way, we can cultivate a culture of wellness and support among members of the Trojan Family.

Freshman forward Penelope Hocking has contributed 3 goals so far this season. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The No. 4 USC women’s soccer team is looking to add two wins to its undefeated season as it returns home this weekend to play University of Missouri and University of San Diego.
Missouri is coming off a tough loss in its second straight overtime home game, falling 1-0 to TCU this past Sunday. Freshman Maddie Warren’s goal in the 95th minute helped the Horned Frogs defend their undefeated title. The majority of the game was a back-and-forth affair, with both teams offering strong defense and offensive attacks. Out of three shots on goal that evening, Tigers goalie Kelsey Dossey had five saves, only letting in Warren’s overtime shot. 
Mizzou has never beaten USC, going 0-2 in all-time play, which could be good news for the Trojans. However, the Tigers are coming off of a three-game losing streak and are looking to secure a win this weekend. They have a strong defense that has forced four of their five games into overtime, giving Dossey 16 saves this season. 
The Trojans will also take on University of San Diego, who last played at home against Utah Valley with a 4-1 win. The Toreros had a tough first half, struggling to find the net, but still managed to lead in shots on goal and corners. Their offense started to click in the second half with freshman Madison Louder back kicking off the 4-goal streak with a penalty kick rebound. 
The Toreros have an all-time record of 6-11-2 against the Trojans. In the last matchup between the two teams, the Toreros fell to the Trojans in a 3-1 loss. The last time the Toreros beat the Trojans was in 2012, and the last time they beat a top-10 team was against Pepperdine in 2014. 
Senior forward Summer Mason and sophomore midfielder Milan Moses have been the most dangerous up top, with Moses leading the team with two goals and five points. Mason is ranked first in the WCC in shots and shots per game, so the Trojans will need to work together to defend their goal. 
In its last game against No. 22 University of Florida, USC brought home a 3-0 win. Headed into the 66th minute of the game with no score, senior Leah Pruitt netted an unassisted goal, putting the Women of Troy in the lead. Freshman Penelope Hocking and sophomore Savannah DeMelo also had goals in the 80th and 82nd minutes, respectively, bringing the Trojans’ goal count to 3. All three players who scored combined  for a total of 9 out of 15 goals this season with three goals each. The Trojans only allowed five shots all night, giving up no shots on goal to maintain their record of 1 opposing goal this season. 
The Trojans are looking strong heading into this weekend having outscored opponents 15-1 this season, the best goal differential in last five years of the program. But defense also forced another shutout in Sunday’s game. 
“That’s the way you win at the highest level,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “You’ve got to be able to defend and we’ve got a group that is gelling and starting to figure things out.”
The Trojans will face off against the Tigers at 3 p.m. Friday and the Toreros at 1 p.m. Sunday, both on McAlister Field. Non-conference play will be over for the Trojans after their senior day game against Long Beach State on the following Friday.

Senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware totaled 100 rushing yards and one touchdown against UNLV. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
This Saturday, the No. 17 Trojans will head to Palo Alto to take on No. 10 Stanford for what will probably be the best matchup of the second week of college football this season. Both teams come off impressive season-opening victories, with USC soundly beating UNLV and Stanford pummeling a San Diego State team that handed Stanford a loss last year.
The new look USC squad with freshman quarterback JT Daniels manning the offense will square off with a Cardinal team led by preseason Heisman favorite Bryce Love at running back for what should be a thrilling game. Here’s how the two squads stack up against each other:
USC Offense vs. Stanford Defense
Last week’s matchup with a SDSU offense devoid of much firepower makes it hard to gauge the strength of the traditionally formidable Stanford defense. They performed well in that outing, holding the Aztecs to only 11 first downs and a meager 113 passing yards in the game, as well as racking up five sacks. Sophomore cornerback Paulson Adebo impressed, breaking up two passes and making eight tackles, as did fifth-year linebacker Joey Alfieri, who also made eight tackles along with a sack and 1.5 tackles for loss. Although the unit performed well, it lacks proven stars, having lost standouts like safety Justin Reid and cornerback Quinton Meeks to the NFL. 
The new look secondary could provide Daniels with a lot of chances to make plays in the passing game, especially if receivers junior Michael Pittman and redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns bounce back to their normal forms. Both receivers had a rough game against UNLV, dropping multiple passes between them, a surprising performance considering their impressive play last season and throughout the offseason. If they can perform at the high level we’ve come to expect from them along with the production freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown showed he can produce, the revamped Stanford secondary could have trouble keeping up with the passing attack. 
“They do a really good job with their pass rushers …. They make you get the ball out of the quarterback’s hands extremely quickly,” Helton said. “We’re going to have to run crisp routes against man coverage. We’re going to have to keep the quarterback upright and in protection. The quarterback can’t flinch. They won’t be open long.”
That’s largely dependent on the offensive line’s performance, though. Last Saturday was shaky at times for the line, even though it only allowed two sacks. If they aren’t rock solid, a Stanford pass rush that gathered six sacks last week could decimate the offense. Stanford’s run defense on the other hand does seem like a weakness, having given up 124 yards on the ground to SDSU’s lead back. 
Another strong performance by the Trojan backfield (over 200 yards last week) could tilt the scales of this game heavily in USC’s favor. Don’t forget that sophomore running back Stephen Carr went off for 119 yards in last year’s early season matchup with the Cardinal while sharing touches with current NFL running back Ronald Jones. Look for Carr to be a featured player in the offensive game plan this week.
Stanford Offense vs. USC Defense
This Cardinal offense is going to be the first true test of the season for a USC defense with high expectations. Junior quarterback KJ Costello put on a show with 332 passing yards and four touchdowns, torching the SDSU secondary. Senior wide receiver JJ Arcega-Whiteside posted a statline of 226 yards and three touchdowns last week. 
“I think [Costello] does a phenomenal job with is, whether it’s the deep ball of a red zone fade, he leaves the ball in bounds — he lets his guys make plays,” head coach Clay Helton said. “You don’t see overthrows, you don’t see missed chances.”
Stanford’s starting receiver group has a significant size advantage on the USC secondary, with Arcega-Whiteside standing at 6-foot-3 and senior receiver Trenton Irwin at 6-foot-2, compared to USC corners senior Biggie Marshall and redshirt freshman Greg Johnson, both around six feet. 
“We’ve gotta make sure that we’re not handsy and that we see the ball and play the ball,” Helton said. “We’re hooked to the man but we’ve got to play the ball at its highest point. Because … they’re taller than [us].”
Although the Stanford passing offense seems formidable, the USC pass defense should be solid, coming off a performance where they held UNLV to a meager 97 yards passing with five sacks on the day. Redshirt senior Ajene Harris, senior Marvell Tell and Marshall should hold down the secondary while the pass rush spearheaded by a now healthy senior linebacker Porter Gustin will look to make life difficult for Costello. 
Stanford’s most frightening weapon, however, is Love, a Heisman finalist from last year who broke the elusive 2,000-yard rushing mark last season. Love is a dynamic playmaker with track-star speed, great receiving ability, and an knack for making defenders miss in the open field. He was actually bottled up well by the Aztecs last week, rushing for less than 30 yards. Still, he’s far and away the most potent weapon on the Stanford offense. USC’s rush defense gave up 308 yards against UNLV (although more than 100 yards of it came off of two trick plays), unable to stop quarterback Armani Rogers from taking off for over 80 yards on the ground. 
However,  for most of the night, they did a good job stymying the Rebels’ backs on the ground, something the stat sheet doesn’t initially seem to convey. Aside from the trick plays and the quarterback runs, the Rebels had about 115 rushing yards on the day. If they can limit explosive plays and frustrate Love, the Trojans should be in good shape. 
Two well-rounded and high-powered offenses will face off against defenses that have yet to prove themselves as elite, and that’s going to put a lot of points on the board a vast majority of the time. Love will not be contained the way he was last week, and the Trojan defense is going to have a tough time stopping him and the passing attack led by Costello and Arcega-Whiteside. That being said, USC’s stable of talented backs and receivers under the direction of Daniels is going to be equally difficult for the Cardinal to handle. Look for this to be a high-stakes shootout, tight all the way to the end with a lot of points put on the board.

The Los Angeles Times announced yesterday that its owner Pat Soon-Shiong has invested, alongside NantWorks, in Daybreak Game Company, a video game company. The primary goal behind this investment is to improve development within the video game industry and stay competitive with other top-tier gaming companies. 
Soon-Shiong joins the elite company of esports investors including the Philadelphia 76ers, New York Yankees’ legend Alex Rodriguez and former Los Angeles Lakers Shaquille O’Neal and Rick Fox have all invested in esports organizations.
NantWorks is also planning to construct the “L.A. Times Center,” which will include an event space, production studio and esports arenas built to handle the bandwidth associated with professional gaming. This space will be located adjacent to the new L.A. Times headquarters in El Segundo.
All of that is great and all, but the real news is that the Los Angeles Times sports section will soon be adding coverage of esports competitions. Words cannot describe how excited I was to hear this news. I have been a fan of esports for nearly three years. As a matter of fact, my first column at the Daily Trojan was about how colleges should adopt esports and how this new form of competition should be considered and treated as a sport. 
For years, investors, players and fans have been laughed at when they try to convince people that esports are sports. These sports traditionalists are closed-minded, refusing to give esports a chance. The decision of the LA Times to cover esports in the sports section of the paper legitimizes the sport as a whole. I urge traditional sports journalists and fans to give esports a chance. So many of the qualities we love in sports are mirrored in esports: The hard work, dedication, overcoming of adversity and showings of pure physical ability all exist in esports.
“The growth of virtual sports has been explosive,” Times Executive Editor Norman Pearlstine said. “We look forward to covering all the major games companies, including Daybreak.” 
The most notable U.S.-based esports league is the Overwatch League, which debuted last year and is located in Burbank. This league’s season spans more than six months in which 12 teams located across mostly the US and some foreign nations compete for a million dollar prize. Traditionally esports have only gained traction overseas in Europe and Asia. Breaking the norm, the OWL was wildly popular in its inaugural season and was a testament that esports can be successful on US turf. 
Another huge step in the legitimization of esports has been the popularization of the battle royale survival game Fortnite. I also wrote a column regarding how Fortnite has helped the esports scene grow, exponentially. I want to redact one of the statements I made in that column. I claimed that Fortnite is not designed to be an esport. What I should have said is that it wasn’t designed to fit the mold of traditional esports. Epic Games has done a magnificent job of organizing their “Summer Skirmish” tournament. They have brought together hundreds of professional players to host a tournament for thousands of viewers to watch.
Bringing esports into the mainstream will not be an easy task. It will take several years for people to adapt to the changing sports landscape. The addition of esports coverage to the Los Angeles Times is a major step forward for the sport as a whole. I only hope that other publications can implement esports coverage and that sports readers will be open-minded enough to consider reading esports content and watching a tournament.
