It finally happened. Quizlet has at last succumbed to the recent coronavirus-induced inflation, proving that students might not be on the forefront of the for-profit company’s mind. The study-help website recently changed its settings so that students who want to study their own flashcard sets can only do so for up to five rounds of certain practice tabs like “Learn” and “Test” — then they have to upgrade to Quizlet Plus. 
Although there are more equivalent substitutes emerging every day, Quizlet has routinely been one of the most popular online learning tools the web has to offer, with two in three American high schools and around 60 million monthly learners utilizing the site. Not only are the graphics and design smooth for mobile and website usage, but Quizlet was one of the pioneers of implementing interactive learning and Rote Memorization — a repetition and customization based learning method that has been greatly successful students of all ages.
So, how much is the upcharge? Resources that were once free are now behind a $35.99 per year subscription (or $7.99 per month for those who don’t want to commit to a full year), which is an incredulous jump and an even more outrageous ask for students who likely don’t have an extra $36 to spend on a whim just to study. 
It’s understandable that the company has to make money, of course, but it’s important to address the dangers that come with asking students to cough up such an amount in order to learn. Students of lower incomes already face discrepancies.
 “[Low-income students] often have fewer resources at home to complete homework, study or engage in activities that [help] equip them for success during the school day,” according to the National Association of Secondary School Principals. 
Paywalls such as the one implemented by Quizlet are just another obstacle that stresses financial discrepancies between students. As the gap between incomes grows with each passing year, inconvenience and extra hoops only further separate these groups.
Maybe there are more affordable alternatives to Quizlet — paper flashcards exist, as well as free downloadable practice exams that are randomly dispersed online. But even putting low-income students in a more time-consuming and cumbersome situation elevates this aforementioned gap. It’s inconsistencies like these that hurt the educational and growth processes that are necessary to grant students from less-privileged backgrounds the ability to succeed at levels closer to their wealthier peers. 
Unfortunately, it isn’t just Quizlet that has been able to force the hand of students. Textbook companies have been upping the price of their textbooks for years, and the current prices for these books can be absolutely outrageous. On average, textbook companies raise the price of their copies an average of 12% with each new edition, resulting in new books costing an average of $80 to $150 today. A student could be taking five classes or more, and each one of these could have more than one required textbook. 
There are likely used copies for sale online, but, again, there are great discrepancies in the quality of information or the way in which the information is presented. As many students might be able to attest, used textbooks are never as quality as the new ones. Pages could be missing, notes could be penciled in the pages or wrong answers could even be scribbled in the margins. These cheaper versions may take longer to arrive (as opposed to buying or renting immediately from the bookstore), quite literally putting students behind. 
I am extremely privileged as I’ve been able to (although begrudgingly), pay the exorbitant fee attached to new books or educational websites (I need Quizlet Plus for my Korean class; I can’t make and learn 250 vocabulary terms without smooth technology). But I do realize that this isn’t a luxury that everyone can afford — and it shouldn’t be a luxury at all. I encourage my fellow students to allow their classmates to use their paid-for resources, to let them borrow the textbooks that they bought or let a friend use their laptop for an hour so they can study for their upcoming exam. If we can’t get big corporations to change their money-hoarding, we can at least try to help our fellow Trojans out.

There was a point in my high school days where I was regularly drinking at least six shots of espresso a day — the equivalent of three Starbucks grande lattes. This unhealthy habit developed for several reasons. One, I had begun to establish a dependence on coffee to stay awake during the day. Second, I loved the taste of espresso, so I would always order drinks that tasted the strongest. Third, I began working at my local coffee shop and had easy and unlimited access to however much coffee I wanted. 
Although I could be considered more of an extreme case, caffeine is the most normalized psychoactive drug, with more than 80% of adults in the United States consuming it every day. Even though the effects aren’t as obviously dangerous as alcohol or marijuana, caffeine has potential to do as much damage, especially in the way that it is encouraged among youth. Caffeine is a staple of our diet — we see it in coffee, tea, energy drinks, soda and more. 
Before diving into the potential negative effects of caffeine, I want to first acknowledge that when consumed in low to moderate amounts, caffeine consumption can actually have some positive effects on the body and life. When accompanied with a healthy diet, caffeine has been correlated with the prevention of diseases including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Type 2 Diabetes, liver disease and more. It can also improve one’s metabolism, help to brighten one’s mood and maintain alertness. Therefore, when consumed responsibly, caffeine can be an incredibly useful tool for a healthy lifestyle. It’s when caffeine is over-consumed where issues tend to arise. 
The FDA states that for a healthy adult, the amount of caffeine “not generally associated with dangerous, negative effects” is roughly 400 milligrams a day — the equivalent of four or five cups of copy, or one to four energy drinks, depending on the brand. Anything over that and the consumer may be in for some health issues.
Caffeine maintains alertness in the body by blocking adenosine — a chemical produced in the brain that regulates how tired you feel — as well as releasing more adrenaline to increase energy levels in the body. However, the more caffeine that one consumes, the more these side effects take action. Excess caffeine can lead to feelings of jitteriness and anxiousness. Additionally, despite common misconception, studies also show that regularly consuming large amounts of caffeine does not build a tolerance to reduce these symptoms. Caffeine also has the potential to lead to increased anxiety, worsened insomnia, gout, trigger heart attacks, dry skin, increased acid reflux and much more. 
The way caffeine is marketed as a necessity to get through any academically or work-related challenge in society is inherently harmful. Drinking excess amounts of coffee to force yourself to stay up at night in order to finish homework or do more work is hardly a foreign concept to any college student. Using caffeine on a regular basis encourages other unhealthy routines, including a habitual lack of sleep fueled by a few nighttime cups of coffee. Even worse is this habit often begins in high school, and in even more extreme cases, in middle school. To develop a caffeine dependence and addiction at such a young age means that one is prone to more of these potential side effects from childhood, and is more likely to irresponsibly consume large amounts of caffeine. 
Dunkin Donuts has a slogan: “America Runs on Dunkin,” and they are completely right. Capitalistic culture in the U.S. is heavily dependent on maximizing worker productivity and encouraging people to devote long hours every day to work. As a result, caffeine consumption is one of the only ways to alter most people’s bodies to be able to keep up with this demand. Many therefore consider coffee and other types of rapidly-working forms of caffeine such as energy drinks, to be capitalism’s greatest asset. Since regular and excess caffeine consumption is so normalized in society from a young age, caffeine addiction goes largely unnoticed and unconcerned. Although normalized caffeine addictions aren’t necessarily directly caused by capitalism, they are quite efficient for keeping the system as productive as possible. 
Caffeine can be a useful resource to help balance our busy college and work lives, but we need to start being more aware of how much we consume and realize when it progresses from a ‘healthy’ moderate amount to an unhealthy dependence.

A sports column was never in the cards for this naive and inexperienced writer whose words you’re currently reading. Sure, sports have always been a part of my life, but am I really qualified to cover them? 
I started my journalism studies believing I would graduate and go live the life of a journalist that I’d always seen in movies: move to D.C., wake up at 3 a.m. every day, cover hard news until I could no longer see straight and have to move to an isolated mountain town to recover. And then write a book about the whole ordeal, of course. 
I then realized that journalism wasn’t all hard news. College is all about trying new things, right? I played sports for my entire life and I liked going to San Francisco Giants games growing up, so I decided that that was enough to dive headfirst into the sports section of this paper. 
Was it enough? Welcome to me trying to figure that out. 
Recaps and previews for the aquatic sports on this campus have been and will continue to be a huge asset to my journalistic experience. However, I’m looking for something deeper in this column, something that the Daily Trojan hasn’t covered in-depth before. 
In recent years, the discourse around the mental health of professional athletes has skyrocketed. We now associate names like Naomi Osaka, Michael Phelps and Simone Biles with the topic, and more athletes are sharing their stories in response. 
Osaka’s lack of appearance at French Open press conferences was met with extreme backlash, and her justification only painted a redder target on her back. Taking care of oneself and their mental health should not be a foreign concept to journalists, however, the stigma remains. No one in the media could understand Osaka’s decision or sympathize with her situation, which only made her relationship with the media more strained. 
However, athletes like Phelps could sympathize and support Osaka, as Phelps’ struggles with depression and anxiety were made public in the early days of this mental health discourse. If more professional athletes open up to the world about their struggles, more athletes will be able to connect and support one another. Mental health awareness and acceptance is an era our generation has been privileged to grow up in, and we need to take advantage of that. 
This is only just beginning at the collegiate level. The most prominent example of this phenomenon is USC’s own Caleb Williams, whose “Seize the Awkward” PSA opened the door for students and student-athletes to start the conversation around mental health. 
The almost three-minute video was revolutionary in the world of college athletics, as Williams still remains one of the only student-athletes to be so vulnerable in the public eye about his struggles. This revolution, however, cannot move forward with only one voice. 
While the door has been opened, it’s really only craked open. The conversation is a whisper in the grand scheme of collegiate athletics, with the epicenter being athletes who already have a massive public presence. The reported pressures on student-athletes so far is more scientific research than actual stories, and that’s what this column will seek to change. 
All USC student-athletes deserve an opportunity to continue the conversation around mental health, whether they are the starting quarterback and Heisman trophy winner or if they play a sport that the Pac-12 network doesn’t even stream. 
Sports writing wasn’t something I necessarily had on my bucket list when I started studying journalism at USC, but writing about real people was. This column will (hopefully) continue the conversation around mental health, with USC student-athletes specifically, and bring about real change for those entering the professional sphere in the coming years. 
Dana Hammerstrom is a sophomore writing about the mental health of collegiate athletes, as well as the emotional pressures they face in her column “Heart to Heart.”

In a double-overtime battle Sunday afternoon, the Trojans fell to the No. 17 Arizona Wildcats 81-75. The Trojans aimed to carry the momentum from a statement victory over Colorado on Friday and looked to acquire their third win against ranked opponents in their return to Galen Center, yet they failed to finish the game on top. 
The Trojans’ offense began the game with 6 early turnovers compared to Arizona’s 2. The Wildcats pounced on these opportunities to take a narrow 12-11 lead at the end of the first quarter.
Graduate guard Destiny Littleton opened the scoring column of the second quarter with a dagger 3-pointer which gave the Trojans their first lead. Littleton took command of the court as USC extended its lead to as many as 10 points and finished the half leading 24-18.
“[Littleton] has the experience, she’s always pumping positive energy into us, and [she] holds us accountable,” said sophomore forward Rayah Williams in a post-game interview. “You can always expect the same from her … great energy, making big shots and making big plays. It’s really great to have her on our team.” 
Coming out of halftime, the narrative shifted. USC’s discipline unraveled as they committed 6 fouls in the third quarter alone compared to their 3 fouls in the first half. Moreover, the Wildcats continued to turn USC’s excess of turnovers into points — USC finished the game with 18 turnovers. 
“I thought we had some careless ones that are going to keep me up tonight, and probably the next night, and the next night until we play again,” said Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb in a post-game interview. “Credit to them, they put a lot of heat on, and if you’re careless in any way, they’re trying to get points out of it … we have to be better with that.”
USC also struggled to defend Arizona in the paint where fifth-year forward Cate Reese scored 22 of her 33 points. 
“Props to her, she was a force on the block,” Williams said. “I was feeling physical and connected with her. I was lucky enough to get a couple of blocks, but I feel like being an aggressor with her would’ve been key.”
Down 39-33, Littleton drilled a 3-pointer at the sound of the third-quarter buzzer. With the lead cut to one possession, graduate guard Rokia Doumbia came off the bench looking to keep the Trojan’s hopes for an upset alive. To tie the game in the final minutes of regulation, she hit a 3-pointer followed by a pivotal layup.  
As the game headed into overtime, Doumbia sustained her electrifying performance when she played a personal-high of 28 minutes and scored 17 points by going 6/6 on field goals.
“Working hard and finally seeing that your hard work pays off [and] seeing that everybody is hyped whenever you get the chance to do something really well, it feels great,” Doumbia said. 
Gottlieb recognized how Doumbia’s diligence in practice has translated into her strengthening impact in the game.
“[Doumbia] has been in the gym extra [and] she has been practicing incredibly well.” Gottlieb said We keep telling them, ‘be ready when the opportunity comes.’ I don’t think this just happened tonight. [Doumbia] was fantastic tonight, but in the last couple of times she’s been in the game she’s been incredibly helpful to us.”
With 5.7 seconds left in the first overtime, USC failed to convert on their possession. The Wildcats secured the second overtime victory when Arizona fifth-year guard Jade Loville scored a pair of clutch jumpers.
“It was a heck of a basketball game … we just couldn’t get the critical stop when we needed to,” Gottlieb said. “I thought our players fought hard enough to give us a chance to win, but we couldn’t close it out. I have no doubt that it’s going to help us somewhere down the road.”
Despite the tough loss, USC remains optimistic as they head into the final stretch of conference play and into the Pac-12 tournament. The Trojans will take on Oregon at Galen Center Friday at 7 p.m.

This year, I’ve been focusing a lot on my mental health. Working to get over toxic tendencies, being more in tune with myself and practicing radical self-acceptance isn’t the easiest thing to do, especially when you’re not sure how to start. 
I’ve noticed that journaling has helped a lot, especially when I do it to songs like Mazzy Star’s “Fade into You” or unreleased Lana Del Rey demos, but another thing that has helped me really be in touch with my inner child is dressing up. 
I love shopping and trying on clothes, but nothing has felt more nurturing and mentally stimulating than raiding my mom’s closet as if I were five again, waiting for my feet to grow into her fantastic and hand-selected shoe collection. 
But dress-up would end as I grew too insecure to wear my curations in public. While I’m still working on that, peeling off my clothes made me think about why we dress in certain ways. 
For designer shows, guests and celebrities are expected to wear the designer’s label: new, unreleased or vintage. It’s a giant slap in the face to wear another brand, and one of the most disrespectful, conscious things a celebrity or influencer can do at a runway.
But there’s still scrutiny on why celebrities would wear the label if they look “bad” in the clothes. This is because it’s celebrating the future and showing respect for the work behind the debut collection. If the outfit truly doesn’t look good, blame falls more on the stylists rather than the celebrity themselves (although, the celebrity is the one who must take the public lashing). 
This is also because it is a form of a test: How much effort is the ambassador or guest willing to put in for their host? 
Some may think this phenomenon is stupid or silly, but we do the same every day in a form of social dress code. 
When I go to business or networking events, I understand my skirt must be longer, and if not then tights must be worn. Blouses musn’t be see through and sneakers are not permitted. 
When we meet the parents of our significant others, we put on our nicest clothes, our brightest smiles and our resume personality. 
Part of this is the literal, spoken dress code (although, this can also be unspoken) — but moreover, it’s about respect for the social dress code. 
The hardest part, though, is not adhering to the dress code, but understanding it and learning how to piece together an appropriate outfit in response to it. 
Some may think it’s about matching and complementing. The dress should follow a third proportion rule, longer or shorter depending on the situation. Heel height follows the same rules. Pants and skirts follow the one-third to two-third ratio to look like you have taller legs or flip it to elongate your torso. 
While the math and calculation portion is helpful, it isn’t the key to a good outfit. One, because matching and pairing is subjective to the person and their personal style. But most importantly, because the secret to an appropriate outfit is not 100% about how it looks physically to the human eye. 
Secretly, it’s only about 50%. The other half is about intention: intention in color, intention in silhouette, intention in brand and intention in your response to the situation at hand. 
How you respond with your outfit will result in different reactions, expectations (in the moment and the future) and perceptions, and each can be a conversation starter for you or among others and can set you apart in a memorable way — but be careful, this can be a good and bad thing. 
Of course, it will depend on your intention. 
Your response to societal and general dress codes is also important because a key to mastering intention is understanding that outfits are not just clothes. Clothes are what you throw on and think, “Good enough.” 
An outfit has been planned out, inspected from multiple angles and (sometimes) consulted with a second party. An outfit becomes an extension and expression of the self and can transform between a bridge and a shield in a single, swift shift of body language. 
An outfit also inspires confidence and requires that internal glow from your chest out. You strut instead of walk, and every moment feels like a movie scene. It’s not a matter of looking conventionally attractive or having an all-designer, hand-picked outfit by Karl Lagerfeld’s spirit himself. It’s internal, set and confirmed intention. 
It transforms your physical space from a body to an entity, and your mindset from neutral and content to radiant, confident and of abundance. 
This is the exact same with makeup as performance art. Doja Cat has been key in transforming the application and intention behind makeup, past concealing and enhancement into performance art in everyday life. Part of her expertise comes from her incredibly creative and specific mind, which helps her execute her vision of the beat-up look for Balenciaga, the false eyelashes as mustaches for Viktor & Rolf and her Swarovski-glued face and body for Schiaparelli.  
Of course, part of the hesitation comes from the purpose behind makeup as a product. I’ve covered up hickeys for almost all of my guy friends at this point and have finally perfected my hack to cover the most angry pimples. I also have finally mastered my face shape and how I can use blush to enhance my cheeks. 
But suddenly, when considering art, makeup isn’t in the same conversation. 
Part of this inability to view makeup as a means of storytelling in our day-to-day lives comes from the stigma we hold toward art. Art, unless commercialized through clothing or overtime with artists like Yayoi Kusama, Keith Haring and Takashi Murakami, is supposed to be scarce and literally made with blood, sweat and tears. 
It takes an astronomical amount of time that is (supposed to be) unfathomable to us uncreative, unartistic bland human beings. That way, we ponder the meaning of pieces and our impact on the world as we walk through art galleries. Thus, we appreciate the art even more as we come to terms with our artistic limits and the fact that we are (most likely) seeing one of one, original artist-print pieces. 
The joke of the art world is whether art is even art at all, and if so, if all art is art, then does art even exist? It’s a cyclical loop of what-ifs and existentialism that is only physically confirmed by the art market, investors, commercialization and the literal presence of museums and galleries. 
So then, if this same idea is applied to makeup, what makes makeup, makeup, instead of art? It also boils down to purpose. 
Makeup as performance art doesn’t need to be obvious and in your face, just as contemporary art can comprise blank canvases that make people scoff and think, “I could do that.” Intending to portray the image of a sweet girl with bubblegum #ffc1cc pink instead of the sultry, mysterious, Parisian woman who wears no blush but blood-maroon #381313 red lips are still valid. My face and my makeup products are choices that, as a result of intention, tell a story. 
So next time you have to go somewhere that requires some sort of dress code — formally stated or even something daily like class — choose an outfit and do your makeup with intention.
Not only will you realize your mind has immense creative space with your “boring,” “everyday,” “I have nothing to wear” clothes, but you might also surprise yourself with how your response to people, life and new opportunities change.

Liz Becker, a junior majoring in popular music performance, approached our interview with an easy geniality that came through her in careful words and kind disposition. Walking in sporting a black puffer and navy cargo pants, she exuded a confident coolness. Her latest track, “Adrenaline,” released Jan. 27, exhibits a careful, refined indie-rock musician on the rise, with relatable lyrics and a sweet voice that contrasts well with the heavier instrumentals. 
“Adrenaline” shows Becker’s vocals moving effortlessly between a whisper and a belt, while the guitars are bouncy and grungy. 
“I actually took a lot of influence from Joni Mitchell melodies when I was writing [‘Adrenaline’],” Becker said. “I also think Del Water Gap is a big influence for me, and Soccer Mommy, too.”
The influences are there; The track feels like a melding of all of these artists with a slick production that elevates Becker’s lyrics to something great. 
Truman Sinclair, a junior majoring in music production who plays in the band Frat Mouse, and Evan Pruett, another junior majoring in music production, Becker’s collaboraters, said Becker has a strong understanding of what she wants and how to get there. The three of them all seem like genuine friends; they made many quick jokes in just the first few minutes of our meeting. This easy camaraderie comes out in “Adrenaline,” giving the track a polished feeling.
“That through line is Taylor Swift, but grungy, a little bit gnarly,” Pruett said of the production.
Becker’s music has an edge that makes it unique from that ofsimilar artists. “Adrenaline” is a big step up from her first single, “Keep it Cool,” in terms of finding a sound that works for her. While “Keep it Cool” is still a sonically-sound track, it’s more mild and soft-spoken. “Keep it Cool” feels like a first effort — like someone playing it safe. In comparison, “Adrenaline” shows that Becker is finding her footing in making her pop-sounding vocals work well within a heavier track. 
“Adrenaline” shows a commitment to her craft. Becker seems earnest in her approach, and her promise comes through in her confessional lyrics. The metaphor of love being adrenaline is curious and a different approach from the mainstream views in indie right now. She sings, “I think I’m finally seeing this for what it is / I’m breathin’ in this oxygen like medicine / I think I’m finally seeing this for what it is / I’ve found other places to get my adrenaline.” 
From reading the press release for “Adrenaline,” one can tell that for Becker, love is overwhelming, and finally being rid of that burden is like a breath of fresh air. In the whirlwind-like nature of youthful love affairs, this seems to be an apt sentiment for finally feeling free from the heartache of a break-up. 
“A lot of times people make music because they’re trying to make a song as opposed to making music because if they don’t, they would fucking eat themselves up forever,” Sinclair said. “Liz can’t really hold on to the things that she’s writing about.”
Sinclair isn’t wrong; Becker’s music feels personal. Especially at a school like USC, there can be a pressure to constantly have to perform and churn things out because that’s what’s expected of high-achieving students — from humanities students writing papers, to theater students performing in countless productions, to music students writing songs. It doesn’t feel like Becker is writing a song simply to write a song, but that she is trying to genuinely say something with her music.
“[‘Adrenaline’] is a song that I wrote without guitar or piano. I started with the melody just kind of singing,” Becker said. “And then kind of wrote the first verse and chorus and then set it to guitar and came up with chords and wrote the rest of it.”
“Adrenaline” doesn’t feel forced. Becker’s natural approach to songwriting makes the lyrics flow and the production seems to follow  her lead, not the other way around. There’s an imprint of Becker in every part of the song. One can imagine Becker and her long blonde hair flowing behind her as she drives down the Pacific Coast Highway when the track opens with “Nothin’ to lose now that I lost you / I can coast down the highway, do things my way.” The zingy guitars at around two minutes, right before the breakdown, add a spot of brightness to the track before she closes it out with the repeated chorus. 
One of the best parts of Becker’s work is that she understands music-making isn’t an island where she does all the work; rather, her collaboration with Sinclair and Pruett show she’s adaptable and ready to put in the effort to make her tracks sound the best they can be.
“I honestly find the most fun I have with writing is stuff like this where you’re just doing it with your friends,” Becker said. 
“Adrenaline” is exactly that: a track that exudes fun and honesty. Becker’s potential lies in her ability to tap into the things that make us feel something, and with the help of her talented collaborators, translate them into something tangible.
“I think that’s what separates her music, because it’s really honest and earnest and she needs to get it out. It was fun as producers, because the songs write themselves,” Sinclair said. “Liz does a lot of it on her own because it’s a passion thing. That’s what separates her music from others.”

In the Busch Light Clash at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum’s second year, Martin Truex Jr. drove away with the win. Heisman-winning quarterback Caleb Williams, comedian and actor Joel McHale and actor Rob Lowe highlighted the pre-race events, with pre-race and halftime performances from hip-hop group Cypress Hill and rapper Wiz Khalifa, respectively.
The Clash made its debut at the Coliseum last year and brought in an audience of around 50,000 people, around 70% of which had never seen a NASCAR race before.
Once again, it was a spectacle to behold with the football field taking a backseat to a small racetrack about a quarter-mile long. Fans poured in as the qualifying races flew by, with the festivities beginning as early as noon before Truex put the race away at around 7 p.m.
From 1979 to 2021, the Busch Light Clash took place at Daytona International Speedway. In the second installment of the Clash at the Coliseum, Truex experienced something for the first time in a while: a win.
“Last year was a pretty rough season for us with no wins,” said Truex Jr. in a post-race interview with Fox. “Sometimes they work out your way and sometimes they don’t. Tonight it went our way and we made some good adjustments too.”
The day began with qualifying races to determine the starting lineup of the main event. Four rounds and two “Last Chance Qualifying” races decided the final six spots of a 27-man starting lineup for the Clash.
Joey Logano, the winner of last year’s Clash, underperformed expectations, finishing in 16th place. Truex Jr. foreshadowed his victory in the second qualifying race, finishing in first. After the rest of the final race’s drivers joined him in qualifying, it was time for the main event.
Aric Almirola, Truex Jr. and Denny Hamlin started the race with the lead. On the 17th lap of the race, the first of many caution flags were waved as Erik Jones spun out. By the end of the race, a caution flag had been signaled a grand total of 16 times.
A second caution flag was thrown after Ryan Blaney (No. 12) took a hit from Daniel Suárez (No. 99). After 24 laps, Hamlin, Truex  and Kyle Busch (No. 8) filled out the top three.
As the race went on, while the top two remained the same, Bubba Wallace (No. 23) made his way into the top three 37 laps in. By the end of the 75th lap, Wallace found himself in first place with Truex in second and Austin Dillon (No. 3) trailing behind in third.
In a caution-filled second half of racing, Wallace maintained his lead with 69 laps to go while Truex trailed in second and Ryan Preece (No. 41) in third. Wallace eventually lost the lead he had sustained for a majority of the race as he fell to third.
With seven laps remaining, Wallace got hit by Dillon, causing him to fall from second to 22nd. In the final stages of the race, Truex Jr. was able to take the lead and come out as the winner after staying in the top three for much of the race.
Dillon spoke about the aggressiveness of the drivers during the race in an event filled with caution flags.
“I think everybody knows here that there is going to be contact,” Dillon said. “During the first 30 laps, my head was against the headrest probably every lap.”
For Truex, the victory was a great way to begin the season after going winless in 2022. From 2015 to 2021, Truex won 29 races before missing the playoffs in 2022 for the first time since the 2014 season.
“It was definitely satisfying,” Truex said after the race. “It’s just nice when it all works out and you can come to the track and things go the way you hope they will.”

Amid a national shortage of emergency medical technicians, a joint USC-UCLA program is offering students an opportunity to become certified emergency medical technicians. 
EMTs provide crucial emergency medical care and transportation for people who become sick or injured, but those services are being strained: According to an American Ambulance Association study, more than half of part-time EMT positions in the United States remained unfilled in 2022. 
In collaboration with Emergency Medical Services of USC, the hybrid program conducted by the UCLA Center for Prehospital Care trains USC students on the skills necessary to operate as EMTs and provide care during emergencies. 
The program, which hosted 30 students during the fall session, began in 2019 after a chance meeting of UCLA and USC members during an EMS conference, said Michael Kaduce, director of EMT programs at UCLA. It has been drawing the interest of students each session over the past few years, he added.
Nima Nikravesh, a graduate student studying dental surgery at the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry who completed the program, said becoming an EMT was a rigorous and fulfilling process. 
Like many students, Nikravesh said he began the course as a way of gaining hands-on clinical practice before entering the field. During the course, Nikravesh learned about the fundamentals of emergency care, from conducting CPR to protecting patient airways.
“I was an 18-year-old student, and being able to learn stuff like performing life saving measures was incredible,” Nikravesh said.
The 10-week hybrid program consists of twice weekly online lectures, followed by a full day each week dedicated to in-person skills training at USC. The next session of the course, which begins in April, is now enrolling. After completing the EMT course, students become certified by taking a national licensing test called the NREMT Exam, Kaduce said. 
Nikravesh said that working as an EMT offers a unique experience of treating a range of unique patients, from minor headaches to major trauma.
“Being able to see how that patient progressed and became so much better because of your care — it is a truly rewarding experience,” Nikravesh said. 
The Emergency Medical Services of USC is a group for USC students who are EMTs to provide services on campus, said Christina Ferrero, director of EMSC and a senior majoring in human biology and healthcare studies. During on campus events, including the Welcome Back Concert and Springfest, EMSC members staff medical tents and respond to medical emergencies, Ferrero said. 
EMSC also works to encourage the USC community to become familiar with emergency medical services, Ferrero said, providing training as well as opportunities to learn more about emergency medicine.
“The privilege of being able to provide these services to the USC community is a gift in and of itself,” Ferrero said. “That generally is the mission of our organization.”
In addition to the EMT certification program, EMSC offers CPR training courses open to USC community members, said Maia Dau, associate director and CPR coordinator for EMSC.
Dau, a senior majoring in biology, dance and Spanish, encouraged anyone with an interest in the field to go through the steps of becoming an EMT. Even if it does not end up being someone’s final career path, she said, the experience provides valuable lessons applicable beyond the field. 
“It has really shaped the trajectory of my life,” Dau said. “It has opened a lot of different doors and possibilities for me, just in that it allows you to hone a lot of skills that you might not be able to practice otherwise.”
Dau said working with EMSC has helped prepare her for interacting with patients beyond a strictly clinical approach.
“We really emphasize treating everyone as humans and as humans first and foremost, before patients,” Dau said. “I’ve really learned how to best navigate tough circumstances.”
After joining the EMSC program, EMTs continue to refine their skills, said Nicholas Cortez, director of training for EMSC and a senior majoring in human biology. Members of the program consistently participate in scenarios that emulate situations they may encounter while responding to emergencies, Cortez said. 
“No two calls are exactly the same,” Cortez said. “So learning that common sense of what gear to use when, and the small nuances between calls, are really important.”
The healthcare field, and EMTs in particular, have faced pressure during the coronavirus pandemic. Ferrero said that even though being an EMT comes with its challenges, the role allows for the development of new mindsets.
“Being exposed to people in their most vulnerable moments – I think that’s something that really can transform a person,” Ferrero said. “It’s important to be cognizant of that and welcome those changes, because they can be really beautiful changes if you allow them to happen.”

USC was home to 15,729 international students in the 2021-22 academic year, making it the fourth largest such population in the United States. That number may change as some international students express concerns over frequent gun violence incidents in the country.
Grace Huang, a research fellow and adjunct instructor at the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy and a USC alum, said her experience as a part-time consultant at Next Level — a China-based firm that helps students pursue higher education overseas — made her notice a trend of Chinese students choosing programs in other countries over the U.S. 
“The data from that company showed that during the past three years, there has been a decline in the number of [clients] studying abroad in the U.S.,” Huang said. “There was obviously a tendency for people rather willing to choose to study in the U.K. and instead of in the U.S.” 
The company’s data is a snapshot of the situation in the past few years — the number of international students from China plummeted by 14.8% in 2021, followed by an 8.6% drop in 2022. 
Despite the declining number of students, China remains the largest source of international students in the U.S., accounting for 30.6% in 2022. The second largest source is India, which contributes 21% of the international student body. Nationally, USC is no exception; The biggest enrollment place of origin after the U.S. is China with 6,166 students, followed by India with 1,691 students, according to the USC Office of International Services’ Fall 2021 fact sheet. 
One of the reasons international students are losing interest in pursuing an education in the U.S. is the frequent gun violence, Huang said. In January 2023, at least 69 people were killed in mass shootings across the country. The closest one to USC happened at Monterey Park.
On the eve of Lunar New Year, a shooter with a modified Cobray pistol opened fire inside a ballroom dance studio at Monterey Park, resulting in the death of 11 people. USC is about 20 minutes away from the crime scene, a fact that worries many international students and their families, Huang said.  
Wanyi Chen, a freshman majoring in narrative studies, said she was celebrating Lunar New Year with her friends when the incident happened. Although she said she was not scared, the safety issues are raising concerns for her. 
“Me and some friends were gathering together, playing games when we heard about the incident,” Chen said. “One of my friends was [at Monterey Park] a few hours prior to the incident, so we felt deeply sorry and upset about this incident.”
Huang said that she had to cancel a celebration plan due to the mass shooting and felt that U.S. colleges are slow to react when dealing with gun violence issues. 
“American universities are assuming that there will be shootings some days,” Huang said. “[Universites] are not doing enough to change what has been concerning for a lot of international students.” 
Jeff Liu, a sophomore majoring in economics and mathematics, agreed that there is a tendency for some international students not to choose the U.S. as their first choice for education. However, he said the decision to study abroad depends on how students and their family value the U.S. education system. 
“Some high-achieving Chinese students who are targeting top 15 schools in the U.S. are not changing their goals, and the cost of changing will be too large,” Liu said. “[The U.S.] is one of the top choices [for international students] and it’s never gonna change.” 
Chen said another factor that might deter students from coming to the U.S. for higher education is the development in education systems in students’ native countries. 
“The education system in China has been well developed in recent years,” Chen said. “Less and less people choose to come to the U.S. because it’s not like what it was in the past.”

Millions across the Middle East were jolted awake Monday morning when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey and northern Syria. More than 4,300 deaths have been reported and more than 13,000 are reported injured in Turkey alone, shocking the student body and hitting close to home for students from the region.
The quake was centered in Gaziantep, a town in South Central Turkey, where residential brick buildings were especially vulnerable to the shaking. Videos on social media show survivors fleeing the rubble and fire in near-freezing temperatures. 
A United States geological survey reported the mainshock occurred at 4:17 a.m. and was followed by multiple aftershocks, one of which reached 7.5 magnitude. 
Ipek Narbay, a junior majoring in neuroscience who was born in Turkey, wasn’t initially surprised when she had heard that there had been an earthquake. Having grown up there, she was used to them. But once it was announced that the quake was a magnitude 7.8, she became seriously concerned. 
“Thankfully, I don’t have any family in [the affected region],” Narbay said. “However, some of my close family friends did end up losing family members to the earthquake and they’re still trapped.”
Emir Ceyani, a doctoral candidate in electrical engineering and president of the Turkish Graduate Student Association, immediately panicked when he heard the news. 
“I was completely shocked and immediately called and texted my family and my close friends,” Ceyani said. “Luckily for my case, there are no casualties at all, so I am really glad.” 
As a leader of the Turkish community on campus, he is already working to spread awareness about the tragedy and fundraise for those in need. 
“We’ll try to collaborate with the Turkish Trojan Association and MENASA to make a fundraiser and we would also like to open an information booth,” Ceyani said. 
Across the globe, nations and humanitarian groups are already pledging aid, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has dispatched significant search and rescue forces.
“Turkey is a very community based country, it’s a collectivistic society. I know that everyone’s going to show up and do their part with search and rescue and [provide] the necessary resources,” Narbay said. “I hope that other countries will give the same attention and funding and resources [to Turkey] as they do [for] hurricanes and catastrophes in the U.S.”
The recovery efforts will be complicated by ongoing conflict in the region: Gaziantep is home to one of the largest aid operations in the world by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, meant to help cope with the high numbers of Syrian refugees in the area. The area of northern Syria impacted by the quake is currently under disputed ownership between the Damascus government and the Syrian Civil Defense, which experts predict may inhibit accurate data collection on casualties, deaths and damage. 
Krisilda Atieh, a senior majoring in biological sciences, was born in Syria and moved to the U.S. as a 10-year-old. She said she is concerned about the availability of recovery resources available to her home country in the midst of the conflict. 
“I know a lot of donations are being gathered, but are they going to be able to get delivered?” Atieh said.  “What cities can [aid groups] get access to? Recovering is going to be really difficult and it’s definitely going to take a long time. But I hope, eventually, Syria can go back to the beautiful country that I remember.”
