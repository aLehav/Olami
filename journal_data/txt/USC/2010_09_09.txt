Virginia comes to town Saturday, setting up the No. 16 Trojans’ home slate at the Coliseum and providing another quasi-test for a USC team hoping to prove to skeptics it is indeed as good as old.
Finding ground · Redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler looks to continue his dominance at the position Saturday against Virginia. Tyler ran for a career-high 154 yards on 17 carries and a touchdown in USC’s win over Hawai’i last week, which was also his first career start. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans struggled with that last week at Hawai’i, coming up empty on defense and allowing 588 yards and 36 points to an inexperienced Warrior offense in a 49-36 win.
But first-year coach Lane Kiffin, who replaced the long-tenured Pete Carroll in January and has already endured a great deal of turmoil in his eight months on the job, has proclaimed with confidence that this game will feature none of the same.
“I think you’re going to see a very different game here,” Kiffin said. “And hopefully a much-improved game from our defense. Let me phrase it this way: I will be shocked if we don’t play extremely well on Saturday night on defense.”
Virginia is also a very different team than Hawai’i. Whereas the Warriors could sometimes pass the ball almost exclusively, the Cavaliers are much more balanced, relying on bruising running back Keith Payne to shoulder the load in tandem with scatback Perry Jones.
“On film, it looks to be that way,” Kiffin said. “But you never know how they’re gonna come in, what their plan will be.”
Virginia quarterback Marc Verica also had a solid opener, completing nearly 70 percent of his passes. Receivers Kris Burd and Dontrelle Inman appear to be legitimate threats as targets.
But Payne is a remarkable story, a 6-foot-3, 255-pound Northern Virginia native who quit the team prior to last season but rejoined it in spring practice, and then — in his first career start for the Cavaliers — carried the ball 16 times for 114 yards and four touchdowns in their season-opening 34-13 win over Football Championship Subdivision powerhouse Richmond.
The Trojans’ run game will be led by redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler, who was named the starter shortly before the season opener and was impressive in his debut, averaging more than nine yards a carry against Hawai’i and totaling 154 yards and a touchdown. Quarterbacking USC, of course, is sophomore sensation Matt Barkley, the newly christened 20-year-old, who had a superb five-touchdown day against Hawai’i.
Virginia coach Mike London emphasized this week that the Trojans have plenty of talent on their roster — regardless of NCAA sanctions and corresponding transfers that have hurt depth.
“I know there’s a lot of talk about who is playing and whom they have lost, but the quality of the talent that they have is indicative of the fact they are one of the top programs that have players in the NFL,” London said Tuesday. “When you look at the game, you see athleticism — from everybody. Even the water boy is athletic and fast.”
Virginia will need to run the ball effectively against USC to have a shot. London wouldn’t admit that but did say ball control would be a factor.
“I do know this,” London said. “You’ll have to take some time off the clock against Southern Cal. USC is a team that plays fast and that tries to capitalize on the things that you don’t do. So we need to make sure that we can keep the clock running, with the running game, short passes that are caught, keep the clock moving, keep the chains moving.”
Kiffin said Saturday’s contest is about the Trojans — not the Cavaliers. He wants his team to focus on fixing what it did wrong against Hawai’i first and, second, pay some attention to Virginia as well.
“Most importantly, it comes back to us,” Kiffin said. “We’ve got to be extremely consistent in what we do — not worry so much about what they do.”

Jovan Vavic insists there won’t be a letdown.
Not on Saturday. Not in the home opener for a group full of so many first-time starters.
Young veteran · Junior two-meter Matt Burton will lead the Trojan attack against upcoming opponents Long Beach State and Loyola Marymount this weekend. Burton is one of only five upperclassmen for the Trojans. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
USC’s 16-year men’s water polo coach knows there might be a tendency for his team to relax following effortless wins over Redlands and Whittier in last weekend’s UCI Invitational. Don’t expect Vavic and his youthful Trojans (2-0), however, to relax anytime soon.
Or ease up on the gas.
“This is a new class; it’s a totally new team,” he said. “So we’re still at a point where it’s special and exciting for these guys.”
With its home opener scheduled for Saturday afternoon against Mountain Pacific Sports Federation foe Long Beach State, followed by a quick road trip to Loyola Marymount for a nonconference matchup Sunday, consistency should be the least of Vavic’s worries. In its last 59 matches, the No. 4 USC men’s water polo team has won 57 times. In each of the last five seasons, it has also finished first nationally in team defense.
If Vavic is to be concerned about anything, it has nothing to do with complacency, but instead with inexperience.
“We’re much, much younger,” he said. “We really need time.”
Yet, if recent results serve as any indication, it’d be tough to form such a conclusion. Just last weekend, the Trojans outscored Redlands and Whittier 53-5 in rather one-sided affairs, where 18 different players finished with at least one goal.
But Vavic, who normally toes the line between confident and brash, appeared more subdued in recent days.
“The opponent was a Division III opponent and that showed,” Vavic said of the first two matches.
The reason for his suddenly anxious front:  defense.
“Our defense takes time to understand,” Vavic said. “It’s very difficult to teach to all our new players. Instead, we have to simplify some of its aspects, especially early on.”
Complicating things further for the Trojans defensively this weekend will be their opponents, Long Beach State and LMU, who look much improved after disappointing 2009 performances. Granted, they lack the overall depth of a top-flight program, but they do feature some of the more talented players in the nation atop their starting units.
The Long Beach State 49ers’ attacker Taylor Clute and Nick Rascon remain equally dangerous offensively after tallying eight goals each during last weekend’s UCI Invitational. The Lions feature a pair of All-American candidates of their own in Edgaras Asajavicius and Tibor Forai.
“They have good outside shooters,” Vavic said. “We’ll have to do a good job of blocking and helping out our goalie.”
Fortunately, Vavic’s emphasis on defense hasn’t been lost on anyone.
“If we’re going to win, it’s going to have to be defensive-oriented like always,” junior two-meter Matt Burton said. “We may not have the experience, but we do have a lot of talented guys.”
It’s hard to argue with those sentiments, especially in regard to the team’s natural abilities — particularly on offense.
Despite far less game experience than their predecessors, 12 players have already tallied at least three goals this season in just two games, including sophomore utility Mace Rapsey, redshirt sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal and freshman redshirt driver Stephen Siri, who all have five goals on the year.
Such an upside does, in turn, give Vavic at least something to grin about these days.
“I am really looking forward to this weekend,” he said. “It’s a talented bunch. For this group, the sky’s the limit.”

How free is free speech?
Until recently, I assumed the only real limitation on my right to speak my mind was the well-known “clear and present danger” clause of the First Amendment — and what a flexible guideline that allows. Although it is sometimes difficult to restrain myself from yelling “Fire!” on a crowded escalator at a mall on Black Friday, I would never be harassed for handing out Socialist anti-war leaflets on campus — unlike poor Charles Schenck, whose Supreme Court case in 1919 birthed this damper of a clause in the first place.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
What I would be harassed for on campus, however, is protesting peacefully inside Taper Hall. Regardless of the nature of the protest, officers from the Department of Public Safety would quickly come and swoop me away, and some higher authority would probably send me a scary letter involving some use of the words “disciplinary action.” Interestingly enough, if I were to hold the same protest within a 20-foot radius of Tommy Trojan, I would be left to my own devices.  
Confused yet?
It’s understandable. USC is one of only a few major private university campuses left in the nation that still enforce a free-speech zone, which is exactly what the name implies: a certain physical perimeter in which the right to free speech can be practiced. At most schools in the United States, free speech can be exercised anywhere on campus at anytime. And why not? Isn’t that a right Americans can take for granted?
But as a private university, USC is technically not bound by the First Amendment. What we do have is a measure known as the Leonard Law, enacted by the California legislature in 1992, which gives students at private universities almost the exact same rights. The Leonard Law requires private schools in California to tolerate student speech in a manner almost identical to that of the First Amendment. Essentially, it states that any form of free speech that would be protected off campus by the First Amendment must be protected on campus by the Leonard Law.
According to SCampus, the official student handbook, USC has the right to dictate “reasonable time, place and manner” for the expression of free speech. Any protests or disruptions that do not fit the senior administration’s rather ambiguous definition of “reasonable time, place and manner” can be “met by the action of the university that is necessary to restore the order.”
Such a restriction might not be widely noticed or even applicable to most students. But incidents in the past have caused USC to overstep arguable boundaries to maintain its strict policies.
In March 2007, the USC Free Culture club was fined for posting fliers within the free-speech zone; the university claimed the club had not had the fliers approved first. So nonsensical was this action on the part of USC that the story was picked up by local news blog LAist, which called the incident a “display of supreme irony.”  
Similarly, in February 2006, artist George Weiss Vando was performing near Tommy Trojan for Gender and Sexuality Week when complaints from DPS and staff about his repeated swearing shut down the show.
It’s somewhat Orwellian, but true: USC students are being given a modified version of their actual constitutional rights. Students who wish to protest or dissent are allotted their time slots, given that they submit a permit two weeks in advance. Political groups may wave their signs and hold their vigils, so long as they are outside the building doors.
And for those who consider the free speech zone just another annoying policy on par with the bike ban, keep exercising your freedom to meet with your friends under the statue of Tommy Trojan. Just make sure you’re loud enough to be heard from more than 20 feet away.

The “free speech zone” idea is incredibly offensive, of course, but you’re wrong to say that it happens at “only a few” major universities. It’s ironic, given what we are taught to believe about higher education, that the one place in American where free exchange of views is MOST restricted is the university campus. I recommend you take a look at the website of an organization called FIRE (thefire.org), the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which fights all over the country for free speech and other fundamental rights on university campuses. They also produce a lot of stories for their Youtube channel, and you’ll see that the things some universities do are beyond belief.
seems like you are trying to stir things up on a non-issue.
Hey D2,
You are lost in the labeling “free speech zone.”
If DPS restricts exercising free speech inside a building, but not by Tommy Trojan, there is an implied “free speech zone.” 
“You appear to be in the correct major.” Save the undermining, judgmental commentary. You are making the school look bad.
Perhaps the author prefers anarchy?
Can’t bare arms on campus either, bur I don’t imagine the author would complain about that subversion of the Bill of Rights
You appear to be in the correct major.  This is one of the most creative pieces of writing I have seen in the DT.  There is NO FREE SPEECH ZONE AT USC!  You should have checked your facts before writing this ill-conceived editorial.  A simple call or interview would have saved you the embarrassment of writing an article so full of falsehoods.  You reach back 3-4 years for incidents and have not checked to see if anything has changed since then.  Students helped clarify USC policies years ago and there IS NO FREE SPEECH ZONE AT USC!  Where is there any reference to this in SCampus?  Reasonable time, place, and manner is a restriction established by the Supreme Court of the United States of America.  Check your facts—this is not an arbitrary determination.  These are the kinds of articles that make people lose confidence in the DT.
Protesting is not productive!

In a recent push for greater faculty accountability, Texas A&M began drafting a new analysis system for evaluating whether or not its university professors are remaining profitable for the 11-university system. Cleverly titled “The Texas A&M University System Academic and Financial Analysis,” the plan seeks to provide a simple method by which the administration might prove to the public that its faculty is indeed pulling its financial weight.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
The accounting itself appears far too rudimentary in its evaluation of educational capital to be of any intrinsic value. To judge individual professors using this analysis requires only the calculation of the money they generate from hours spent teaching — the tuition being transacted between the students in the seats and professor standing at the blackboard — and the amount of external research funds they haul in.
With all the recent fuss about grading teachers in Los Angeles, I’m beginning to wonder how much outside evaluation is too much to subject our professors to.
Frank B. Ashley, the vice chancellor for academic affairs for the A&M System, said to The Eagle, the official newspaper of Texas A&M at Brynn-College Station, that there are several immediate benefits to implementing this plan.
“I think the first thing this will show is that pretty much every university in the system, pretty much every college, pretty much every department, is pulling its weight,” Ashley said. “There might be one or two departments that are running in the red. [But] overall, we’re operating in the black.”
But this analysis cannot be considered an adequate evaluation of individual professors any more than basing faculty pay off anonymous student evaluations can be considered a foolproof reward for good teaching.
Coincidentally, another plan offering awards between $2,500 and $10,000 to faculty members based on student opinions was pitched to the Texas A&M regents in May 2008; a version of which was then implemented across the A&M system. The correlation between the professor’s actual value as a knowledge provider and whether their students’ tuitions can afford them cannot be examined so easily.
The model only accounts for a fraction of the things professors are rumored to do. A faculty member can only teach 10 hours a week for a total of seven units a semester, but to judge their work solely on this is to ignore all the hours they spend grading papers, in office hours and actually organizing the materials they teach.
Another factor that should be taken into account is the appropriation of research funds.
Most professors do quite a bit of research in their various disciplines outside of teaching. This research tends to not be directly profitable to the university because it pays for the majority of the labs; money the university spends should not be counted as the professor’s deficit. The university wants the best professors it can hire and the professors want the best salary, research, grants and environment they work in. It doesn’t make sense to discount that research.
The implications of this analysis process trouble me. If a professor is in the red under this evaluation system, then his response is obviously going to be to try to make the university more money. And how does he do this? By putting his research on the backburner and dropping some of the mid-range level, more intimate classes to take on heaps of circus-sized intro lecture courses. Overworking the faculty and forcing professors into teaching useless courses surely will not add much to the students’ educational experience.
The most interesting and engaging classes in my experience are not the ones where we sit twiddling our thumbs, squished in like sardines among a mass of bleary-eyed students while a vaunted professor paces the front of the room and monologues for two hours. Rather, they are the more intimate classes where a raised hand might actually get answered before the next theory of the universe has been pulverized to its exhaustive conclusion.
I’m okay with the financial analysis system for the time being. Texas A&M can pull whatever gimmicks it wants to to ensure that it continues to receive taxpayer dollars for educational purposes — just so long as it doesn’t degrade the actual education it is providing in order to do so.
“As being partly paid by the public purse, I believe we owe the public some degree of accountability — I don’t have a problem with that at all,” said Peter Hugill, A&M chapter president of the American Association of University Professors, to The Eagle. “What I have a problem with is silly measures.”

Tucked away on most Facebook profiles are the inevitable USC-related groups and fan pages. Now, the official USC Facebook page can join this assorted collection.
The official page launched in July and in two months, it has garnered more than 3,600 fans, comprised of students, prospective students, alumni, faculty and people who like the university.
The page came in response to an unofficial one that was not approved by the university, said Maya Meinert, editorial assistant at USC University Public Relations who manages the page.
“We discovered the unofficial page and we decided that we should own that space and use the value of the USC brand on Facebook,” Meinert said.
The page features a variety of content from events, competitions and notable achievements by faculty and students.
“We work very closely with the admissions office on the main page because of the volume of admissions inquiries we get from fans,” said Ariel Carpenter, director of USC public relations.
The page recently gathered a series of admission questions from fans on Facebook and submitted them to USC’s Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold. His answers were posted as a response on a discussion tab of the page.
“We take a very integrated approach to the page,” Carpenter said. “We work with heads of schools to highlight what is important to them and what’s happening at the schools.”
Administrators of the page, for example, are currently working with the Viterbi School of Engineering to publicize Viterbi Grand Challenges, an event that works with the National Academy of Engineering to address the issues of the 21st century.
Although the fan page is not  going to be included in any official USC pamphlets or handouts, there is a link to it on the university’s main website.
“We are actually working on promoting the page more organically through crossover with our Twitter account,” Meinert said.
The opening of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center demonstrated the success of the social networking outreach. Fans were encouraged to tweet live from the event and share pictures with others in real time.
“It allowed a peek at the event for those that were not present,” Carpenter said.
Presently, the page is focusing on providing fans with information they want to know and will evolve based on the needs of the users.
There is no doubt, however, that the page represents another step in USC’s effort to embrace  popular social media platforms. The latest trend has been geo-tagging; USC now manages its virtual existence on Foursquare, the location-based social media.

A university professor has created the USC Student Energy Network, a platform through which students and faculty can learn about the future of energy and  better connect to the USC community.
USCENE is the brainchild of professor Mark Bernstein and research assistant Ryan Kallabis. Bernstein, a practice of political science professor, said he had been considering creating a group such as USCENE for two years.
“You have to learn from all other pieces to be successful at making decisions [or] you’re not going to get that through a major,” Bernstein said. “This is an opportunity to diversify your knowledge.”
Bernstein was inspired to create the club after hearing about the Harvard Energy and Environment Network from a professor at Harvard College.
USCENE will provide an opportunity for students to network with other students, faculty and outside experts through a series of discussions, meetings and field trips.
“I really wanted to find a way to engage students in energy issues outside the classroom,” Bernstein said. “I want to find a way to get students across disciplines to talk to so we can create the next generation of decision makers who are going to make better choices on energy than my generation did.”
USCENE will accept up to 75 students, both undergraduate and graduate, from any major or department. More than 20 students are already enrolled.
Students in the network will learn more about the technology  and economics of energy resources, and the role politics plays in those fields. Enrolled students will be able to share experiences, meet experts in the field, visit energy facilities and demonstrate their work.
Bernstein said he hopes students across all majors will share ideas, find relationships across their disciplines and develop energy projects. The goal is to trade information and spark collaboration between interested students, he added.
Kallabis, a senior majoring in political science and a research assistant at the USC Energy Institute, said the energy job market is expanding and it is critical for all students to be very familiar on the subject of alternative energy.
“For any student, this is the biggest opportunity for us,” Kallabis said. “Never burn any bridges and close any doors. It’s a network that will be with students when they leave and graduate.”
Brook van Muijen, a senior majoring in political science, said he is joining the club because he wants to learn more about the most effective long-term energy solutions.
“People tend to look at alternative energy issues and simply look for the road to make profit,” van Muijen said. “The network is giving us a better idea of what is the best idea of what is actually most innovative for the future.”
Bernstein said the network would students him a hands-on opportunity to integrate their interests with USC’s research efforts.
“You learn stuff in class, but that doesn’t give you all the pieces you need to understand a broader view of the energy issues,” Bernstein said.
There will be at least three networking events, two meetings and one group trip. The meetings will feature speakers and discussion sessions on different topics. Trips could include visits to wind farms, Southern California Edison hydroelectric facilities, refining operations and solar research facilities.
Though tentative plans have been made for the group, Bernstein said they would change as needed.
“I want this [to] evolve with what the students decide what they want,” Bernstein said. “I am seeding it and I want it [to grow] and we will continue to support it through the energy institute.”

Ah, the back-to-basics album.
In the storied history of recorded music, this difficult career maneuver has often been attempted. In general, the album follows a promising debut and a one- or two-album downturn; it is an attempt to recapture what the band did right on its first album.
After their stellar debut album Turn On The Bright Lights, Interpol band members were declared the new gods of New York City post-alt. After their equally stellar, but
not all that different second album Antics, they retained their throne but left some yawning. That’s when they decided to fix what wasn’t broke yet. Their third album, Our Love To Admire, reinvented and broadened the scope of their music, and it was a critical disappointment. And here is their fourth album, an obvious attempt to figure out exactly what they did right on their first album.
The back-to-basics album.
As is the case with many a comeback album, Interpol — the eponymous album — hasn’t quite hit it on the nose. “Barricade,” the album’s first single, might be the best single acid-test here. It’s bass heavy with pounding drums and sparse utilitarian guitars, a pretty accurate early-Interpol impression.
And like any good Interpol impression, the smooth, deep voice delivers weighty non sequiturs such as Full speed half blind full tilt decline / We turn to past times. These lyrics, however, don’t feel weighty, and threaten to expose the flimsy songwriting that was always hiding behind singer Paul Banks’ conviction.
Vocally, Banks is in top form, but lyrically, nothing quite lands right. Again, on that lead single, phrases such as It starts to seem like a barricade / To keep us away have the look and feel of “Slow Hands” (from Antics), but lack punch in delivery and content.
The second single, “Lights,” is likely the strongest song on the album and hopefully an indicator of what the future of Interpol holds. What it has done right, or at least better, is return to its old sound without completely forgetting lessons learned from Our Love To Admire. Garnished with the pop sentiments that overpowered the former album, Interpol’s standout track is a good mixed drink and a lousy simile away from impotence, but it manages to marry that classic Interpol sound with the little things that worked on its sonic departure.
The major problem with the album is that no song possesses an immediacy that is even closely comparable to the best of Turn On The Bright Lights and Antics. In fact, although the sound of the record is considerably improved over its poorly received predecessor, Our Love To Admire had songs that were stickier, even indelible. Interpol has none.
As blasphemous as slight praise toward Our Love To Admire is, it was a distinct and indelible departure from the formula. Antics was excellent, but as hard as it was to admit, it was a worrisome similar-sounding piece of work that begged the question: Is this all they can do? And after the disappointing third album that, in retrospect, was somewhat catchy, the answer might be that the Interpol sound is all that band should do.
It is a bittersweet realization that this band has ultimately amounted to something less than its early canonization promised. As the word “bittersweet” suggests, however, that’s not the worst thing that could have happened. Interpol is, by a full leap and half a bound, a better album. Although it’s a step backward, in this case, backward is the right direction.

Is the film worthy of the story?
That is the question that must be asked, and answered, about The Sicilian Girl ­— and every other film based on a true story. After all, fiction isn’t fiction when the characters are real. But let’s save the answer until I’m done rambling.
The Sicilian Girl is based on the true story behind the downfall of the Sicilian Mafia in the early 1990s. Anyone familiar with the time period knows that the downfall was as grotesque as it was bloody, and a time when the violence hinted at by so many Hollywood films was an ugly reality.
Some government authorities, prosecutors and  their family members were intimidated, tortured, brutalized and ultimately killed by the Mafia, who tried to stave off the not-so-inevitable. The Mafia eventually went down but it dragged many poor souls as its centuries-old charade collapsed on its head.
Among the persecuted was Rita Atria (Veronica D’Agostino), the 17-year-old informant whose testimony is largely considered responsible for bringing down the Cosa Nostra. Her diaries — kept since her father’s death — were the lynchpin of the prosecution’s case against the Mafia, revealing the complicated web of lies and deceit that bound the Mafia together.
Her story is one of confrontation and loss as she seeks to avenge the murders of her father and her eldest brother, both of whom were killed by the order of the reigning Don Salvo (Mario Pupella). This is the motivation for her diaries, written with the knowledge that they would one day see the light in a court of law.
Revenge, however, is hardly that simple. Her father was a mob boss, killed for refusing to enter the drug trade. Her brother was his heir, bred for the bloody responsibilities of leadership, killed just as he emerged as a threat to the status quo.
Thus, to avenge her father and brother’s deaths, she must confront and accept the fact that they were as evil as the people who killed them, just as hateful as the men she dedicated her life to defeating. Italy has long been plagued by revenge murders, leaving many generations lost. Rita must break this chain and shift her banner from that of revenge to that of justice.
It is a classic conflict, one that emerges slowly and beautifully. And the complexity grows along with Rita. At first it is simple; it is the perspective of a young girl. But as she matures, the fullness of the reality emerges, making The Sicilian Girl a film that proves to be much more than it first appears. That is a rarity in film and it is engrossing to watch.
Many pinnacle sequences stand out as well, particularly the murder of Rita’s father, Don Michele (Marcello Mazzarella). Shivers run down your spine as you see him killed in the broad daylight of a piazza as 12-year-old Rita looks on. She cries for help, and no one answers. She is forced to leave her father’s body as his blood snakes its way across the piazza’s white bricks.
If only the cast were as solid.
Indeed, they are The Sicilian Girl’s Achilles’ heel, turning in a series of workman-like yet unremarkable performances.
The chief culprit is D’Agostino. It’s not a bad performance per se, but there is little to praise. Her portrayal of Rita is an appropriate mix of fear, defiance and immaturity, but she fails to reach the depth that would make her character shine. With a young female protagonist such as this one, a movie is supposed to evoke conflicting emotions. Namely, you’re supposed to see the strength that makes it possible for her to succeed while also sensing the vulnerability that allows for the possibility of failure. You know she can succeed, but will she?
D’Agostino fails to achieve this, and her character is less dynamic for it. Roles such as Rita are like par 5s in golf — you’re supposed to birdie them. She pars it to the film’s detriment.
Indeed, only Mazzarella stands out among the cast. He is only on the screen for a few minutes, but his presence resonates throughout the film. His portrayal of Don Michele is an exquisite mix of kindness and humor that is tinged with the sternness of a Mafia don. You see both the killer and the father — the man a young girl might idolize and the man who orders men to their graves.
So, is the film worthy of the story? I’d say yes, but barely. The performances weigh the film down, but do not stand in its way. The filmmaking is solid, and the beach scenes are especially exquisite. The narrative is a bit slow to start, but the film hits its stride about one-third of the way in. The Sicilian Girl could have been a contender. Instead, it is merely another addition to the Mafia genre.

Bran Nue Dae will throw off any preconceptions you might have about an Australian movie about Aborigines.
This is not a movie about the oppression of Aborigines endured under the white settlers. And it’s not about the injustice and discrimination they faced during several centuries of foreign domination. It’s not about the suffrage they finally earned in the 1960s.
Sing it loud · Director Rachel Perkins’ latest film features Geoffrey Rush as a strict Catholic priest trying to reign in Willie (Rocky McKenzie), an Aborigine teenager who only wants to return to his hometown. - Photo courtesy of Freestyle Releasing 
No, this movie — which opens today at The Grove Pacific 14 Theatres — is a musical, and a garish, ridiculously comedic one at that.
Willie (Rocky McKenzie) is a soft-spoken, sensitive Aborigine teenager from Broome, sent by his religious mother to a mission school in Perth to become a Catholic priest. There is just one problem: Willie has no desire to become a priest. In fact, he spends most of his days pining for his hometown sweetheart, Rosie (Jessica Mauboy).
The catalyst comes when the ruler-brandishing priest, Father Benedictus (Geoffrey Rush), tries to discipline him for breaking one of the Ten Commandments, “Thou shalt not steal” (in this case, candy bars and soda pop). Willie runs away — but not before breaking into an outlandish, hilarious dance, singing, “There is nothing I would rather be than to be an Aborigine.”
The plot of this movie is straightforward and simple: It’s about a boy who just wants to go back home to Broome. Along the way, he meets several wacky characters: Uncle Tadpole (Ernie Dingo), a homeless alcoholic who claims he’s a relative by blood; Annie (Missy Higgins) and Slippery (Tom Budge), two Buddhist hippies on a “vision quest”; Betty (Magda Szubanski), a lascivious, hot bun-selling (wiggle eyebrows suggestively at “hot”) roadhouse owner; and Roxanne (Deborah Mailman), the scandalous drunkard who promises a “proper good time” to anyone.
If you’re looking for depth or an enlightening theme about cultural suppression and survival, you’ll be disappointed. The whole movie is, dare I say it, stupid. What else can you say about a movie with a scene dedicated to underage seduction beneath the Condom Tree? Or an outrageous ending in which everyone is related to everyone, regardless of race?
Nevertheless, it does throw in a few snarky and subtle messages — the image of Father Benedictus, his arms spread wide like a grand savior in front of quaking Aborigine students, suggests a parody of self-righteous white colonists and missionaries. Annie’s romanticism of traveling with two “exotic” Aborigines and her boyfriend Slippery’s guarded distrust toward them portray the ignorance and misconception most people have about Australia’s indigenous people.
Despite making the top-50 Australian films of all time at the local box office, Bran Nue Dae still faced criticism for juxtaposing lighthearted comedy with serious subject matter like Aboriginal Australia. Where are the tears? The outcries against racism? But director Rachel Perkins, who herself is part Aborigine, wanted to avoid precisely that.
In a Q&A session after the film’s screening, Perkins said that her main goal for this film was to reach out to a wide audience.
“I wanted to dispel the common assumption about Aboriginal films,” she said. “Many people don’t want to watch movies about Aborigines because they think it’s going to be depressing and make them feel guilty and bad. But I didn’t want that. I want my audience to go home happy.”
In fact, Perkins actually had to resist the temptation to add deeper touches to her film. Used to producing grittier films and documentaries, she struggled to keep things light and simple in this piece, hoping to showcase the fun-loving side of the people.
“[The truth is] we like singing, laughing and dancing,” Perkins said. “We don’t sit around talking about social justice.”
Finding Aboriginal actors who were willing to sing and dance in front of the camera proved tough, however. Perkins talked about feeling overwhelmed after watching a Chicago production and realizing that she would never find the time, money and talent for a musical as polished. Instead, she had to embrace the fact that her film would be “rougher and looser” on the edges.
Indeed, most of her cast, including the majority of lead characters, are first-time actors.  Mauboy, who plays Rosie, is known for her musical talents as the 2006 Australian Idol winner, but had never acted before. Neither had McKenzie, whose first question to Perkins was whether he would be on DVD as well.
As for the backup dancers, Perkins literally had to pick them off the streets.
In one particularly memorable scene when Willie makes his grand departure from his boarding school singing, “There is nothing I would rather be than to be an Aborigine,” the schoolboys hop into a tap dance behind him, arms and legs thrusting all over the place in different beats.
This group of unruly dancers is actually a bunch of high school students that Perkins bussed in and taught how to dance, sing and act — in one day. Such was the nature of limited resources available to Perkins in the making of her movie.
But in a strange twist, this amateur performance actually works in her favor. The coordination is so mismatched that the dancers seem to exude unadulterated joy that is both believable and charming.
By injecting humor and gaiety into an Aboriginal film, Perkins has managed to do what many film critics have criticized her for failing to do — she has nonchalantly opened up an easy acceptance toward people of all races and cultures.
In any case, you will be humming “I’d rather be an Aborigine” on your way home. But as you trail off with “and watch you take my precious land away,” you’ll realize that Bran Nue Dae is more than just a frolicking entertainment.

A federal judge ruled the controversial “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy unconstitutional today, saying it violates the First Amendment. 
The Log Cabin Republicans, an LGBT Republican political organization, filed the lawsuit against Defense Secretary Robert Gates, as a representative of the United States.
The ruling states that “The don’t ask, don’t tell act infringes the fundamental rights of United States service members in many ways … In order to justify the encroachment on these rights, defendants faced the burden at trial of showing the don’t ask, don’t tell act was necessary to significantly further the government’s important interests in military readiness and unit cohesion. Defendants failed to meet that burden.”
U.S. District Court Judge Virginia A. Philips, a Bill Clinton appointee, also said that the policy had a “direct and deleterious effect” on military forces. She also noted President Barack Obama administration’s anti-DADT stance by writing that the “Defendants called no witnesses, put on no affirmative case and only entered into evidence the legislative history of the act.”
Obama has called the ban a threat to national security, and the House of Representatives voted to repeal the policy in May.

Thanks to an effort by the Graduate and Professional Student Senate, the Health Sciences Campus will receive a new fitness center in November 2011.
Body building · A new fitness center at the Health Sciences Campus will provide graduate students with a place to take classes and exercise. - Heather Lee | Daily Trojan 
The organization, which represents graduate students, began working with administrators four years ago to build a gym on the graduate student-only campus. The final plans were announced in August.
The 10,000 square foot fitness center will be located slightly off of the Health Sciences Campus, but will still be within walking distance for students. USC will also offer a tram to and from the gym.
Construction has begun on the project, and it is currently on track to open next year.
The issue of the gym was brought up at one of GPSS’ “HSC Concerns” dinners last year, and a subcommittee was formed to tackle the issue.
Rosanne Yetemian, the former GPSS Health Sciences chair, said that USC administrators were looking for hard evidence that a gym was what the students wanted.
“It was ironic to us, being a health sciences campus, that we [didn’t] have a fitness facility to use,” Yetemian said.
Yetemian worked with GPSS to design a survey to evaluate HSC students’ needs. More than one-third of students returned the surveys, and the desire for a gym was “overwhelming,” she said.
After demonstrating to the university administration that students needed a gym for both convenience and academics, the plans for the new gym were launched.
Though details about the features of the fitness center are currently unavailable, GPSS President Jenny Novak said it should function as a “full-service gym.”
Jennifer-Ann Bayan, the current GPSS HSC chair, said the gym will also offer a place for fitness classes, including yoga and kickboxing. The current fitness classes at HSC have a limited number of spots because of space constraints, and are held in classrooms and conference rooms across the campus.
Despite being about seven miles from the University Park Campus, traffic makes it inconvenient for HSC students to use the Lyon Center, Bayan said. On a good day, it takes HSC students about 45 minutes by tram or about 30 minutes by car to get to the Lyon Center.
Previously, students wanting access to a closer gym were able to get a discounted rate at the local Bally’s gym, but that program has since been discontinued after a lack of student participation.
The fitness center will be housed on the first floor of a building originally intended for administrative offices and classrooms. After the results of the survey and GPSS lobbying efforts, however, administrators elected to turn the first floor into the gym.
The new center is only temporary, however, as a permanent gym is slated to be built as part of the HSC Master Plan, which includes many construction projects.
For the time being, GPSS members said they are happy with what their organization has accomplished.
“If we didn’t put the effort forward [for the gym],” Yetemian said, “then nobody else would [have].”
Clarification: 9/12/10 — A previous version of this story stated that the student discount program at Bally’s was discontinued because of the construction of the new HSC gym.  The program was discontinued, however, it was because of a lack of student participation.  This entry has been updated to reflect the changes.

Gabe Alvarez, a former Trojans shortstop who played third base for both the Detroit Tigers and San Diego Padres, was named an assistant coach by interim coach Frank Cruz. The three-time All-American will add valued experience and insight to the team.
Alvarez’s primary role with the team will be to work with the infielders, but he and assistant coach Doyle Wilson will coach all the hitters as well. His effect on star junior infielder Ricky Oropesa is something that could reap huge rewards for the Trojans’ baseball program.
Alvarez’s playing career at USC was successful, to say the least. He had a .338 career batting average and led the 1995 Trojan squad that reached the championship game in the College World Series. The 1995 team, with Alvarez, third baseman Morgan Ensberg, and outfielders Geoff Jenkins and Jacque Jones, was the first Trojan baseball team to make the CWS since 1978. Alvarez received many honors because of his outstanding performance.
Subsequently, Alvarez was drafted fifth in the 1997 expansion draft for the Arizona Diamondbacks. He never played for the Diamondbacks at the major league level. He made his major league debut with the Tigers in 1998 and was with the organization for two years, before ending his career with the Padres in the 2000 season. He played 92 total MLB games in his career.
His addition to the coaching staff could play a key role in whether Cruz keeps his job, and the level of success in infield play for the team.

Professors from the Keck School of Medicine have packed their bags and headed to Uganda to encourage fitness and promote health. A group of USC experts, including professors Jane Schmitz and Jonathan M. Samet, arrived Tuesday to open a sports gym at the Uganda Parliament chambers.
Schmitz said she hopes Uganda can play a role in promoting African health awareness via exercise.
The group traveled with former national bodybuilder Robert Ssebugwawo, who spoke to Ugandan members of Parliament earlier this year about using exercise to fight “common non-communicable diseases,” such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity.
The gym opened in Parliament to serve as a role model for all Ugandans, Schmitz told the Daily Monitor.
The health promotion program, which includes the gym donation and related equipment, reportedly cost $50,000 and was implemented through USC’s Institute of Global Health.
“We are here for two weeks and hopefully we’ll do some good work,” Schmitz said.

Yesterday, web giant Google debuted its latest feature: Google Instant. Instant generates results as you type, creating a set of real-time search results before you can even hit “search” or “I’m feeling lucky.” According to the company, Instant can save two to five seconds in a search. “Start typing and results appear right before your eyes,” the function’s official page reads. “Until now, you had to type a full search term, hit return, and hope for the right results.”
Yes, because that took so long.
Google is the search giant of the Internet, and search results previously came in at a fraction of a second. Reactions have been mixed — with privacy complaints already emerging — but so far the buzz has been mostly positive.
Yet how necessary is this feature? While it is great that tech giants such as Google are continuing to innovate with a focus on real-time data, is the company just reinventing the wheel? And why not simply use this as an update to Google proper instead of creating it as an optional add-on?
Although there are still many unanswered questions about the new feature and a long way to go before a true experience-based consensus can be formed, one thing is clear: Google is still the fastest search engine out there.

About 80 medical marijuana dispensary operators and advocates gathered at City Hall on
Tuesday to hold a small rally protesting the city clerk’s announcement that only 41 of Los
Angeles’s dispensaries are operating legally.
The group conducted a small protest outside before marching into City Hall to demand that the
city council reverse the decision, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Under a city ordinance that took effect in June, officials claimed that 128 of the 169 dispensaries
that applied to remain open are ineligible to continue operating.
Many of these were not approved because of an often-overlooked requirement in the city
ordinance, which requires dispensaries to have constant management. Since registering with the city in 2007, many of
the more prominent dispensaries have added more managers.
The city will not seek to shut down the ineligible dispensaries, however, provided that they
showed intent to register and fully comply with state law.
