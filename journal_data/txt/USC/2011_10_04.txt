Despite today’s volatile markets, USC student investors are faring better than most. Students in portfolio management seminars say the economic crisis has not stopped them from putting money into a wide range of securities.
In the last school year, one fund in the graduate-managed Student Investment Fund saw a return of 34 percent, while the Undergraduate Student Investment Fund had a return of 12.99 percent, according to a Marshall press release. Both performed better than the Standard and Poor 500 Index benchmark standards.
Mick Swartz, an associate professor of clinical finance and business economics, said market turmoil should not deter investment.
“People tend to be motivated by shorter-term time horizons,” said Swartz, who has taught FBE 453 and 553: Applied Portfolio Management. “They look over the next year and it doesn’t seem like a good outlook, so they tend not to invest.”
This is a mistake, according to Swartz. Through hands-on experience in SIF and USIF at the Marshall School of Business, students have learned a central tenet of investment: Timing is not everything.
Part of the philosophy behind Marshall’s investment practicum is a simple one: Invest real money. Lose real money, or get real returns.
Though investment classes abound at business schools, not all allow undergraduates to manage $600,000 and graduates to manage $4.5 million of the university’s endowment money. SIF co-manager Teige Sullivan, a graduate student studying business administration, said the real stakes heighten his care.
“We have a fiduciary responsibility to the endowment dollars,” Sullivan said. “[Strategy] depends on the individual’s investment thesis, but since it’s real dollars, we take the utmost care in investing it.”
Sullivan advocates choosing high-dividend, non-cyclical stocks during economic downswings to maximize cash in hand. Another safety measure suggested by Bill Nugent, a workplace planning and guidance consultant at Fidelity Investments, is portfolio diversification. Nugent thinks young people need to not be so risk-averse, however.
Meixi Chen, a senior majoring in business administration and international relations who is one of 12 USIF managers, said the experience is instructive because it relates to theory learned in the classroom.
“What I learned most is definitely how to correlate investment to the macro economy,” Chen said. “Knowing the correlation opens my eyes and makes me want to take more economics classes to focus on the broader picture.”
Chen also said co-managing USIF has taught her which stocks to favor during recessions. Though technology and industrial companies might fluctuate in hard times, Chen said, defensive sectors such as consumer staples and health care prove resistant to the market’s fluctuations.
Kevin Finn, a graduate student studying business administration, co-manages the California Small Cap Fund, one of the five SIF funds. He said the main hurdle to investing is not the current market situation, but the restrictions that come along with the portfolio. His particular fund cannot invest in a company with a total stock market value more than $5 billion.
“I think it’s a challenge a lot of portfolio managers deal with,” Finn said. “You have investment mandates — you have to find stock that fits those mandates.”
Aside from USIF and SIF, the Value Investing Group at USC also seeks to educate students about value investing using personal funds. VIG co-president Kevin Swick, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said members follow Benjamin Graham, a prominent 20th-century economist, and Warren Buffet’s chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., value investing principles to take charge of their own investments. Since Swick used his own high school graduation money, he has learned to manage his investments judiciously.
“I research the stocks that I’m going to buy more thoroughly when it’s real money,” Swick said. “I make sure that everything in my checklist is met rather than making speculations.”
Students involved in the stock market generally agreed that company quality comes first when investing real money. As Swartz pointed out, people often place too much importance on a company’s growth and not enough on the actual value of a stock.
According to Nugent, there is no reason college students should hold off learning to invest.
“The most powerful tool young investors have on their side is time,” Nugent said in an email. “Starting young means having more time for your investments to be in the market and potentially grow — and you have the benefit of compounding on your side, which can be powerful. And starting young means you should be able to recover from a market downturn.”

The USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning is expanding its presence to The Row by offering fire safety drills and promoting fire education to university and non-university-owned Greek houses.
Safety system · USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning staff will visit Phi Delta Theta Fraternity to improve its fire safety plans. The fraternity invested in a new fire safety system after its house burned down eight years ago. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Jeff Pendley, USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning specialist, said drills and walk-throughs will begin as early as next week.
In the past, fire safety checks for residential housing were under the jurisdiction of Environmental Health and Safety, but responsibility has been turned over to Fire and Safety because the department now has sufficient resources to do so.
Pendley said his department had always wanted to reach out to The Row to officially ensure proper safety procedures are being followed, but did not have enough resources to ensure they would be able to offer adequate services.
Both USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning and Environmental Health and Safety fall under USC Career and Protective Services, along with departments such as the Dept. of Public Safety, Disability Benefits, and Risk Management & Insurance Services.
Pendley said this was the start of his department offering its expertise so safety procedures would be improved.
“We want to make sure [the houses] have adequate fire extinguishers. Even though we cannot force regulations upon non-university houses, we can make recommendations,” Pendley said. “We are working on doing that this year.”
Many Greek houses on The Row welcome the initiative, and fraternity and sorority presidents said they appreciate USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning reaching out to them. Phi Delta Theta Fraternity President Naader Banki, a fifth year senior majoring in biological anthropology, said the program will stress the importance of fire safety to the Greek community.
“This initiative is effective and beneficial because it introduces the idea that fire is a real threat and should be considered realistically,” Banki said. “The idea that presidents [of houses] are aware promotes better safety. It is an excellent first step that will lead to more involvement between houses on The Row and [USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning].”
Banki stresses the importance of fire safety since Phi Delta Theta’s fraternity house burned down eight years ago.  He has already spoken with USC Fire and Safety and recognizes the importance of their inspections.
“Our house has one of the best fire systems,” Banki said. “[USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning] contacted us at the beginning of the semester, giving us the option to come in and help with a fire drill,” Banki said.
Other houses have not yet worked with USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning but have set a date to meet with the department to administer fire drills this semester.
Gamma Phi Beta Sorority President Tess Atkinson, a senior majoring in business and psychology, said the house manager previously coordinated drills.
“We have one [a fire drill] scheduled for this semester,” Atkinson said. “Fire safety is a huge priority for us since we have sixty girls living in the house. For USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning to partner with us, it will give us more tools that could help us.”
USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning said it plans to assist at least six houses by the end of the semester as a preliminary goal. It also plans, however, to offer its services to all houses by the end of the semester.
“We will help as much as they want us to,” Pendley said. “We can offer our services and most of them are open to have us come in and do that.”
I think Phi Delt is just happy to have those hot firemen around the house

Students said they liked the new look of the Web Registration site now that it has been reformatted.
The new site went up on Sunday and now includes a cardinal and gold color scheme, a calendar view with gridlines and an easier method for students to choose classes. It easier to manage the course bin because the home page is no longer split between the course list and course bin.
Jenn Kranz, a sophomore majoring in theatre, applauded the improvements for making the site easier to use and more aesthetically pleasing.
“The Web Registration is more effectively organized,” Kranz said. “It’s a lot easier to navigate and the new color scheme shows school spirit.”
Students appreciate the face-lift and improved functionality. But many feel online registration could still be improved by streamlining the process into one step, rather than separate steps
“It’s easier to use and I like the color scheme,” said Amy Beck, a sophomore majoring in French and psychology. “It would have been easier if they got [Web Registration] down to one step.”
Associate Registrar Frank Chang said the new site was years in the making.
“We have been wanting to do this for [a long] time,” Chang said. “We are always evaluating our systems and finding ways to make them better.”
Before making the improvements, the Undergraduate Student Government and administrators solicited suggestions from students through focus groups and other surveys, USG Senior Director of Communications Sabena Suri said.
“We are really excited about the fact that the whole system is running really smoothly and we feel like it reflects the changes that the administration and the students really wanted to see,” she said.
The improvements aimed at rectifying problems with the old format, such as the difficulty in using the site and its aesthetic unpleasantness.
“The changes addressed the fact that the system was outdated and difficult to use, in addition to not being as engaging of a platform as it could have been,” Suri said in an email. “They are best reflected in the aesthetics of the site, especially with the use of the cardinal and gold color scheme.”
USG hopes to host a student forum in the next few weeks with representatives from the registrar’s office and Information Technology Services to address online academic resources, such as Web Registration and Blackboard, according to USG President Monish Tyagi.
Daily Trojan, were you really unable to find a student who did _not_ like the new web registration site?  I know I’m not the only one – and the reason is because it requires far too many clicks to add and schedule courses.  (e.g., that pre-requisite page which shows up when adding courses.)  If I’m remembering correctly, the old system required fewer clicks.

With the 2011-2012 season still over a month away, the USC men’s basketball coaching staff is scheduled to visit the Las Vegas home of Shabazz Muhammad, ranked No. 1 overall in the ESPNU 100 for the class of 2012, for the second time in a month, according to ESPNLosAngeles.com.
The 6-foot-6, 215-pound Muhammad attends Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas.
The left-handed small forward has also expressed an interest in UCLA, Kentucky, Duke, Kansas and UNLV, among other top college programs.
USC coach Kevin O’Neill and associate head coach Bob Cantu also visited Muhammad and his family on Sept. 9, the first day of the NCAA contact period.
Muhammad’s father is former Trojans forward Ron Holmes, who played for USC in the mid-1980s.
Muhammad is also scheduled to visit the USC campus on the weekend of Oct. 28 and attend the USC-Stanford football game to be played on Oct. 29. His only other scheduled visit is a trip to Kentucky on Oct. 14 for the the Wildcats’ Big Blue Madness practice-kickoff event, the report said.
The Trojans already have two commits for the class of 2012: guard Larry Lewis from Phoenix and forward Strahinja Gavrilovic of Serbia.

With no game scheduled for Saturday, USC’s first bye week of the season, the Trojans began using the additional practice time Tuesday to refresh and work on technique as they prep for California.
Second look · Freshman quarterback Max Wittek (left) took reps during Tuesday’s practice. Wittek has been with the team since the spring. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
USC is fresh off a 48-41 win over Arizona, which featured record-breaking performances for the Trojans.
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley surpassed Carson Palmer’s mark of 454 passing yards for the most passing yards in a single game by a USC quarterback with 468. Barkley also earned honors as the Pac-12 Player of the Week — the second time Barkley has been chosen in the last three weeks.
Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods was five yards short of breaking the school single-game record for most receiving yards after notching 255 receiving yards.
On Tuesday, however, USC coach Lane Kiffin decided to give Barkley a short rest, opting to give freshman quarterback Max Wittek more reps.
—
The offensive line played a vital role in allowing Barkley to find his receivers on Saturday as the signal caller was not sacked. After a dismal game against Arizona State, offensive tackle Kevin Graf went back to the film room to correct his mistakes. Graf admits he was not focusing entirely on the opposing team.
“Instead of focusing on the other team for the first couple of days, I focused on myself and what I needed to change,” he said.
Graf plans to use the bye week to keep working on his technique to refine his game.
“Since we have so much time, it is a really good time to freshen up on the technique and everything I need to work on,” Graf said.
—
Junior safety T.J. McDonald believes the bye week has come at a perfect time for the Trojans.
“Coming off of a team like Arizona, we know that they had an explosive offense,” McDonald said. “We bent a little bit, but we didn’t break and we came out with the ‘W’.”
McDonald had two interceptions against Arizona, his first two of the season.
“It was a great feeling,” he said. “They finally came at the right time and against a quarterback that hadn’t thrown any for the whole year.”
—
With a week off before playing California on Oct. 13, the Trojans are using the extra time to rest and recover.
“It has come at a great time for us, especially with our issues on defense,” Kiffin said. “We have spent some extra time, so hopefully we can get Torin [Harris] and Lamar [Dawson] back.”
USC’s depth on the defensive side of the ball has been lacking. As senior linebacker Chris Galippo had to play every snap against Arizona State and Arizona, the coaching staff was also forced to mix and match players. Redshirt freshman Anthony Brown, as a result, got his first career start to replace Harris.
McDonald stressed the importance of utilizing the bye week effectively.
“The biggest thing is that we don’t take this time and just rest,“ he said. “Of course we need to rest our bodies and get healthy, but at the same time we’re going to stay in shape and actually get more conditioning.”
—
The Trojans will face the Golden Bears in familiar terrain: AT&T Park. The Trojans last played there in the 2009 Emerald Bowl against Boston College.
Graf said he is excited for the match-up.
“It’s different but it is going to be fun,” he said. “We are going to play in the Giants’ stadium so it should be a lot of fun.”
Kiffin emphasized the need to not let games like Saturday’s, in which the USC defense gave up a school-record 37 first downs and allowed quarterback Nick Foles to throw for 425 yards and four touchdowns, cloud the players’ collective mindset.
“We’ve got to be careful that we are not overreacting to a game or two,” Kiffin said. “We have to take it all in and look at who we are playing.”

Five games into the college football season, the nation’s best players are building their cases for the sport’s biggest award.
The race for the Heisman Trophy, given annually to the most outstanding player in college football, is watched almost as closely as the battle for the national title.
Top target · Through five games, sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods has caught 55 passes for 757 yards and six touchdowns. He has not, however, garned much consideration for the Heisman Trophy. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
Preseason Heisman favorites like Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck, Alabama running back Trent Richardson and Oklahoma quarterback Landry Jones have solidified their candidacies with strong starts.
Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III and Wisconsin quarterback Russell Wilson have put their names into the mix with eye-popping statistics.
Here in Los Angeles, Robert Woods leads the country in receptions (55) and receiving yards (747), while his six touchdown catches are second best in the nation.
Despite his early season success,  the sophomore wide receiver is not considered a serious Heisman contender. Sports Illustrated and ESPN release weekly Heisman watch lists, ranking the top 10 candidates for the award after each slate of games. Woods has yet to appear on either list.
It begs the question: What more does Woods have to do to put himself into the national conversation about the most outstanding player in college football?
He’s already broken USC’s record for most catches in a game, 17 against Minnesota, and came only five yards short of the school’s all-time single game high of 260 receiving yards against Arizona last weekend.
The Carson, Calif., native is on pace for 132 catches and 1,792 yards in 2011, totals that would be good for seventh and eighth place, respectively, in the NCAA record books.
Woods’ situation is the perfect case study of what the Heisman Trophy has become. Instead of honoring the nation’s best player regardless of position or team success, Heisman voters nearly always choose the quarterback or running back of one of the nation’s best teams.
For one, Woods’ position on the field doesn’t lend itself to Heisman campaigns. Only two wide receivers have ever won the award: Tim Brown of Notre Dame in 1987 and Desmond Howard of Michigan in 1991.
Since the turn of the new millennium, nine of the 11 winners have been quarterbacks. The other two — USC’s Reggie Bush and Alabama’s Mark Ingram — were running backs.
Voters usually give extra weight to quarterback play because of the importance of the position: They touch the ball on every play and direct the offense.
Players like Woods, however, can transcend the traditional position description and force defenses to account for them on every single play.
USC coach Lane Kiffin has dubbed this phenomenon “the Robert factor,” referring to the way defenses send two or three defenders toward Woods on a regular basis, creating opportunities for other players to get open.
During one play in USC’s road loss to Arizona State, Woods lined up in the backfield, causing frantic pointing and shouting from the Sun Devil defense about whom should account for him. As the ball was snapped, Woods ran to his right, drawing all of Arizona State’s attention as Marc Tyler ran the opposite way, gliding 10 yards untouched into the end zone.
More and more in recent years, award voters have made team success one of the primary qualifications for individual accolades.
Nine of the past 11 Heisman winners played in that year’s national championship game, including the last three. All six of the top-ranked teams in the USA Today Coaches’ Poll have nationally recognized Heisman candidates.
Griffin, who quarterbacks the No. 25 Baylor Bears, had to complete 82 percent of his passes and throw 18 touchdowns to only one interception this season to get noticed.
Though USC will always earn more than its fair share of media attention no matter its record, the Trojans no longer have the nation’s respect like they did five or six years ago.
Currently unranked and unable to play in a bowl game, USC would have to put together an extraordinary second half of the season to even sniff a top-10 spot in the Associated Press Poll, hindering Woods’ Heisman case.
If that weren’t enough for Woods to overcome, the Trojans’ NCAA sanctions and postseason ban provide a whole different set of challenges.
The Heisman Trophy is no stranger to USC’s Heritage Hall. Six trophies are proudly displayed on campus.
It’s the most recent winner, however, who gave Trojan athletes another hurdle to deal with, one unique to their situation.
The fact that Woods plays for the only program to ever give back the Heisman following NCAA sanctions won’t help his case with some of the voters.
It’s safe to say that short of rewriting the entire receiving portion of the NCAA record books, Woods won’t win the Heisman this year.
Then again, as opposing coaches have been telling their defenses all season, you better you keep your eye out for No. 2 in cardinal and gold. He’s likely to surprise you.

The reason the Heisman winner is consistently from a school vying for a national title is that a Heisman winner in one of the big bowl games attracts viewers, which attracts advertisers, which attracts money and endorsements and network deals for the NCAA.  Money makes the world go round.  Money is responsible for all this conference realignment nonsense, is the reason that college football will never see a playoff (that is of course unless it becomes more profitable to have a playoff…mark cuban tried to front the bill, but his pocketbook apparently wasn’t big enough).  Robert Woods won’t win the Heisman even if he logs 10,000 receiving yards, 2,355 touchdowns and flies to outer space on a unicorn.  The NCAA needs the Heisman winner to provide sports center with some ammo to invent an ethereal storyline leading up to January 9 so that even the ambivalent college football fan will tune in.
Wait, but the NCAA is an organization devoted to the development of young men and women as well rounded individuals.  False.  The NCAA certainly values its student athletes; that is to say they value each athlete for the revenue they bring in.  The NCAA doesn’t want student athletes to be paid because they don’t want to throw away all of their convictions…oh wait, they don’t have any convictions, they just don’t want to miss out on the free money.

There certainly was plenty reason for optimism.
Opening the season ranked No. 2 and boasting three returning senior All-Americans to go along with a top-10 recruiting class, the USC women’s volleyball team’s expectations were quickly tempered.
Pleasant surprise · Sophomore outside hitter Sara Shaw, pictured here on Sept. 23 against then-No. 1 California, has notched 15 kills thus far this season, leading the No. 5 Women of Troy to six straight wins after starting the season just 5-3 overall. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy lost two of their first three matches, including a shocking upset to unranked Central Florida, and fell flat in a 3-0 sweep in their Pac-12 opener against UCLA in front of a record crowd of 5,385 at Galen Center, giving them a 5-3 overall mark — the first time USC had lost at least three of its first eight matches since 2005.
“With our conference schedule starting so early this year, we didn’t have [time] to try different things,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “So we had to guess at some things in the lineup. It just seemed like we didn’t have the right combination out on the floor.”
With his squad struggling, Haley decided to insert sophomore outside hitter Sara Shaw into the starting lineup in place of fellow sophomore Kirby Burnham, an outside hitter and opposite.
So far, the move has paid immediate dividends.
Shaw tallied a career-high 15 kills and led the team in hitting percentage (.481) to spark USC in a road sweep of then-unbeaten No. 4 Washington.
“She’s a comfortable person for everyone to play with,” Haley said. “[Shaw] was instrumental in settling us down.”
Since the UCLA loss, the Women of Troy have ripped off six conference sweeps in a row for the first time since 2003, when they won the NCAA championship.
The streak includes victories over California and Stanford, who were ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, at the time.
“We were all just really pumped and excited going against these two good teams,” Shaw said. “We had nothing to lose at that point, so we just gave it all we got and had a good show.”
Another unexpected source of offense has come from freshman middle blocker Hannah Schraer, who has started all season while sophomore middle blocker Alexis Olgard recovered from offseason knee surgery and a bout of mononucleosis.
Schraer is ranked third in the Pac-12 in hitting percentage (.386) and is averaging 1.73 kills per set.
“In the beginning, it was a little stressful just getting used to the speed of the game,” Schraer said. “Now as a team, we’re definitely more comfortable playing together.”
Schraer’s numbers are nearly identical to Olgard’s, who ranked fifth in the Pac-10 with a .366 hitting percentage while also averaging 1.73 kills per set last year.
“Usually, freshmen middle [blockers] can’t do what [Schraer] has done,” Haley said. “She’s really done an exceptional job. I have not had a freshman come in, other than Olgard last year, who has played like this.”
Olgard played briefly last weekend against Colorado and Utah for her first appearances of the season, and Haley said she should be back to full speed by mid-October.
Haley said he wants to give junior middle blocker Natasa Siljkovic some playing time when she returns from the injury and wants to work Burnham and other bench players back into the rotation.
Haley is encouraged by the progress he’s seen over the past few weeks, but he knows that anything can happen from now until the NCAA title match in December.
“We’ve gone on a nice roll, but we have two more months of the regular season yet to go,” Haley said. “My experience [as coach] says don’t get too excited this early, and don’t get too down. You just gotta stay with it and keep improving.”

The writings of American mythologist Joseph Campbell left an undeniable imprint on our culture.
Campbell’s famous philosophy can be summed up in three simple-yet-loaded words: “Follow your bliss.”
Finding Joe explores this deceivingly simple mantra with respect to the modern human experience.
Archetypal heroes · Patrick Takaya Solomon’s film Finding Joe dives into the mythical histories of worldwide cultures and features scenes of child actors re-enacting Joseph Campbell’s original stories interspersed with interviews with an eclectic group of intriguing professionals. - Photo courtesy of Pat and Pat Inc.
With portrayals of classic mythologies interwoven with personal anecdotes and insights from a wide range of contemporary figures, the film attempts to inspire a new way of life.
At the risk of becoming a film version of a Campbell self-help book, director and producer Patrick Takaya Solomon takes viewers on an 80-minute ride through “The Hero’s Journey.” The film explores overarching themes from mythologies all over the world.
Not only is this theme found among ancient tales, but the concept of “The Hero’s Journey” is prevalent among contemporary literature and films such as The Wizard of Oz, Harry Potter, The Matrix and Star Wars.
One of the film’s few flaws is the way the message is presented: trite and overdone. Though Solomon intentionally chooses interview subjects from diverse backgrounds — including actress Rashida Jones, celebrity Dr. Deepak Chopra, pro skater Tony Hawk and Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke — the commentary often feels redundant.
Rather than its celebrity lineup, though, Finding Joe finds its strength in compelling visualizations that interpret ancient mythologies with a contemporary touch. The enactments, performed by a motley group of kids who are surprisingly talented actors, effectively keep the stories fresh.
The film begins with a tale of a golden statue of Buddha, which is covered up with armor and concrete to fend off wartime enemies; over time, its true material is forgotten by all.
Author Alan Cohen explains the moral of the story, as it relates to viewers’ lives: We are originally born of purity, but years of conditioning from outer influences pile debris on our unadulterated matter.
“We are not separate from the characters we see in our movies and novels,” Cohen said in the film. “They are us. It’s one journey.”
Pairs of enactments and analysis pace the remainder of the film, keeping the material engaging and fresh without retreating too far from real-life applications. Though the messages behind the ancient tales are often easy to guess, the afterthoughts offered by the interviewees reinforce and supplement viewers’ ultimate revelations.
The film takes a closer look at the three major stages of “The Hero’s Journey”: separation from one’s natural environment, initiation via challenges and tests and finally the triumphant return home to tell the story of archetypal metamorphosis.
The most compelling parts of Finding Joe show several interviewees dropping their inhibitions and sharing deeply personal anecdotes from their own experiences in persevering through these stages. One story is that of Gay Hendricks, who recounts his transformation from a 320-pound, chain-smoking man who hated his job to a trim, best-selling author.
Their accounts illustrate the mythology of “The Hero’s Journey” as not only a plotline of ancient myths, blockbuster movies and bestselling novels but a guide for our quest to find deeper potential within ourselves.
By taking a seemingly clichéd mantra such as “Follow your bliss” and pairing it with true, relatable accounts from contemporary figures, the film invites viewers to dig deeper into their own psyches.
Though Finding Joe is unlikely to throw one’s world upside down, it does offer plenty of food for thought, pressing the need for what might be a well-deserved self-examination.

He’s known by several names, but “Mr. Verwest” is still not one of them.
Veteran entertainer · Despite his age, Tiësto shows no signs of slowing down and even expresses interest and inspiration in performing with newer musicians, such as Porter Robinson, and playing for younger-than-usual crowds. - Photo courtesy of Rephlektor Inkorporated
“Mr. Verwest? Mr. Verwest is my father,” Tijs Michiel Verwest — also known as Tiësto — said with a laugh. “I can call him for you if you want.”
His banter is funny but, more importantly, telling. The 42-year-old is not even close to shedding his role as one of the most titanic, legendary house and trance DJs of all time. And Tiësto continues to push the envelope with his career.
Fittingly, Tiësto has launched an unprecedented, expansive tour geared toward college students, titled “Tiësto’s Club Life College Invasion Tour.” The tour targets major venues near college campuses and features discounted tickets for students.
“Electronic music is growing and I really wanted to give a chance for students to experience it, especially if they wouldn’t be able to afford a normal ticket,” Tiësto said.
The “College Invasion Tour” will make its final stop at the Home Depot Center in Los Angeles on Oct. 8 and promises to be a spectacular end to an already successful tour.
“We wanted to make this historic moment special.  So we’re rolling out the production values on this one,” Tiësto said.  “State-of-the-art lights, special effects — people should expect to be blown away. That’s what I’ve planned.”
Oh, and the music should be pretty good, too.
Tiësto’s music has grown considerably since the birth of his career, blossoming from traditional trance and house styles to a more varied, arguably catchier beat marked with clever collaborations, as with Tegan and Sara’s appearance on the ever-addictive “Feel It In My Bones,” of his most recent album Kaleidoscope.
“I guess it’s much more eclectic than in the past — I’d say my music now has more vocals, more melody, but still with a hard house feel behind it,” Tiësto said.
In his quest for musical progression, Tiësto said he was inspired by the recent rise of newer DJs.
“My influences come from a lot of different places, but I do love the younger DJs,” Tiësto said. “Afrojack is one that comes to mind. The scene is a lot bigger, and it makes me excited to see what’s coming up.”
When asked if a rise in musical competition was a concern, Tiësto paused for a second, then chuckled.
“It’s better for everyone when there’s more talent,” he replied. “It forces everyone’s music to be better.”
Electronic music has experienced a surge in prominence recently with peaks such as David Guetta’s inexplicably popular “Little Bad Girl” and Afrojack’s sexy, bass-bruising trance hit “Take Over Control.”
Tiësto, for one, believes it might have something to do with the rise of another recent trend.
“With the growth of Facebook and other social media, there’s been an explosion of how much electronic music makes it to mainstream consumers,” Tiësto said. “In the past, the media had been so controlling in what audiences got exposed to.  Now, there’s more freedom.”
This freedom has also allowed fresher talent to be discovered — really fresh, in some cases.
Electronic phenom Porter Robinson, only 19 years old, has joined Tiësto on the “College Invasion” project to play his acclaimed blend of electro house and dubstep. Established pros Dada Life and Diplo have also joined the tour, rounding out what Tiësto said is “an incredible group of artists.”
“I’m really excited. I love all these DJs. The four of us all have our own special flavor,” Tiësto said. “Well, it’s a dream lineup, really.”
The “College Invasion” shows don’t just reward fans, though. Tiësto said a younger crowd seems to give another welcome burst of energy to his performances.
“My usual crowd is closer to 30, I think. These 18- and 20-year-olds are awesome. They have a lot more energy,” Tiësto said, with a chuckle. “It’s a wild raging party.”
Tiësto hopes his concluding show will be a hit.
“I still just love seeing people blown away at shows,” Tiësto added. “I’m really expecting that come Oct. 8.”

In the entertainment industry, the thirst for profit never fails to lead to somewhat questionable decision-making, especially when it comes to adapting storylines from one medium to another. We’ve all seen it: Books and TV shows are turned into movies, and movies are turned into video games.
Last summer brought us playable versions of blockbusters, such as The Green Lantern, Thor, Transformers and Captain America. Meanwhile, this upcoming winter promises an array of familiar titles such as Happy Feet Two and Jurassic Park: The Game.
Movie-based video games have been a part of the gaming market for nearly three decades now. But in terms of quality, this “genre” of video games ranks consistently at the lower levels.
Movie-based video games have had a bad rap since their introduction in the early ’80s. Games, such as the Nintendo Entertainment System’s Back to the Future and Ghostbusters, accrued nothing short of widespread criticism for their awkward controls and disjointed storylines.
In 1982, despite the universal success of its cinematic counterpart, the Atari 2600’s E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial was met with such hostility that its failure to impress buyers most likely contributed to the video game industry crash of 1983.
Today, the stigma against movie-based video games has changed little with companies continuing to spew them out in armies of unimpressive final products.
But recently there have been some positive changes. With advances in high-definition technology and increasing expectations for complex storylines and gameplay, video game companies are slowly beginning to place more emphasis on quality rather than quantity.
The last few years have featured a decline in the number of movie-based video games on the market. In 2009, 15 movie-based games were released, whereas in 2010, there were only 11. The number decreased even more last year and will likely continue to drop in the future.
It appears the industry is finally learning from its mistake of saturating the market with poorly-developed companions to box-office hits.
Even this change can’t completely shake movie-based games’ images as low-budget train wrecks.
So how can the gaming industry give movie-based products a new name?
The biggest problem occurs when companies attempt to synchronize the release of their video games with the release of the games’ movie counterparts, which results in rushed production and overly simplistic, generic gameplay. Though this marketing move sounds reasonable, it isn’t an absolute necessity, especially if the threat to meet deadlines compromises the game’s overall value.
The solution is to limit the creation of movie-based video games to large franchises. Therefore, if a movie is a part of an ongoing franchise, a movie-“inspired” video game, rather than a direct movie-based game, could allow for more flexibility with its release date and give developers more time, money and energy to put into the project.
For example, 2009’s Batman: Arkham Asylum was released a full year after the premiere of The Dark Knight and was still met with high praise. The extended period of time between the release of the movie and its loosely tied video game encouraged game creators to produce an end result that enticed Dark Knight fans as well as hardcore gamers.
Similarly, Aliens: Colonial Marines, a game based on the Aliens movie franchise, is scheduled for release in spring 2012. A demo version previewed at this year’s Electronic Entertainment Expo left fans eagerly craving to dive into the dark and delicious adventure of a game that has been in the making for years.
In contrast, Wanted: Weapons of Fate, a game based on the 2008 movie Wanted, sold poorly after hitting the shelves a full four months after the release of the DVD. Because the movie was not part of a larger franchise like the Dark Knight or Aliens, without the steady support of a continual fan base the later release date was a fatal business decision.
On the other hand, if Weapons of Fate had been released earlier, production value would have been lacking. High-quality video games take at least two to three years to make, which is precisely why large franchises are best-suited for movie-based video games.
Of course, the only exception to this rule is that children’s movie-based video games are almost always guaranteed to be hits. With these games, graphics and gameplay don’t need to be the highest quality to appeal to kids; as long as they resemble the movies, they’re ready to hit the stores.
Aside from children’s movies and large franchises, there really isn’t any need to create movie-based video games anymore. Doing so only pushes consumers to lose more confidence in the gaming market and potentially mimic what happened in the 1983 crash. No video game is a guaranteed success, but if game companies at least try to limit the amount of movies they make into games, they’ll have a better chance of producing enjoyable and superior products.

An imitation, a desecration, a simulation of life. So the female, Afro-Deutschen character Schatsi is described in Bliss. USC professor Velina Hasu Houston’s play, which was performed Monday at the USC Fisher Museum of Art, however, is anything but an imitation of life. It’s the real deal.
Cultural beauty · Velina Hasu Houston’s play Bliss was performed as a book reading at the USC Fisher Museum of Art, which featured several photographs from the “Posing Beauty” exhibition. - Photo courtesy of USC Fisher Museum of Art
Directed by Jon Lawrence Rivera, Bliss, is set in familiar Los Angeles, where two mixed-race characters, Schatsi and Dagmar, come to terms with race and identity in a society where racial roles are clearly drawn.
Schatsi (Liz Vital) is of Tanzanian and German descent, as is her twin sister Dagmar (Tessa Thompson), famous for her role as Nyla in the 2010 Tyler Perry film For Colored Girls. The two grew up in Topanga Canyon, Calif., before moving to Los Angeles with their German mother, Inge, after the death of their African father.
There’s only one problem. Schatsi, blonde-haired and blue-eyed, resembles her German mother, while her sister Dagmar, yellow-skinned with “kinky” brown hair, resembles her Tanzanian father. As they move into a race-conscious society, they must reconcile who they really are against society’s perceptions.
Of mixed-descent herself, Houston was well equipped to write the play, which draws ideas from films like Imitation of Life (1959). After studying films of the early ’90s, Houston noticed a trend and asked herself, “Why is western cinema so fixated with the tragic nature of the mulatta?”
Houston was also able to draw on personal experiences; she grew up with a friend whose life paralleled that of her characters.
“One of these girls [who I grew up with] was blonde-haired and blue-eyed, but half-black,” Houston said in the post-performance Q&A. “For most of my career, I’d written about the tensions of Asians and blacks and Asians and whites. She asked, ‘When are you going to write about our family?’ So I started to look into it.”
Bliss focuses on the two protagonists with great detail to narrow in on these given issues. It is this specificity that enables the audience to visualize the performance as if it were a full-fledged production, despite the fact that the Visions and Voices event was a concert reading performance that featured no set, minimal lighting and actors on-book.
The play did, however, have the artsy, creatively abstract “Posing Beauty” exhibition that served as the backdrop for the reading and added to the play with its racial parallels.
Evidently, Houston relied on her own wit over that of a production designer, crafting dialogue rich with characterization. The writing created little need for movement for actresses Vital, Thompson, Elizabeth Ruscio and Vivia Font as they worked off the script and effectively conveyed emotions through their voices and facial expressions. The play spoke for itself.
“Even though I’m writing about a racially charged situation, the most important thing I wanted to talk about was this family,” Houston said. “That was something everyone could relate to.”
Family was not the only connecting point for the audience. Houston makes sure to include other relevant issues too, allowing modern audiences to establish firm connections. Specifically, she brings up how in a seemingly post-racial society, students still prefer to befriend those of their own race and how Americans call each other racial slurs with no thought of the larger implications.
Houston also hammers home the difficulty of being mixed in a culture where one can essentially be defined by race. She focuses on “uniqueness” and “separation.” For instance, in the opening sequence of the play, the girls plant a garden with their mother and talk of hybridization of plants, polka-dotted lady bugs and sing songs about loving the variety of color in their clothes, bringing mixed culture to light through motifs and symbols.
“What I’m trying to take out — until the end — is all notion of race,” Houston said. “All I’m talking about in the beginning is difference. Then slowly that [racial] language begins to slip into their language.”
A sense of magical realism is evident in her subplot. Based on Imitation of Life, the story of Honeychild centers around that of a mulatto girl. Born with extremely light skin, Honeychild spends her life trying to “pass” as white, turning her back on her black mother and her true identity.
A foil for the present-day character of Schatsi, Honeychild crawls out of the family’s old, broken-down television set and tries to impart words of wisdom to Schatsi, who ultimately doesn’t listen and gets into all sorts of trouble.
It is this story within a story and the close resemblance of racism in the past to racism today that makes the play so utterly complex.

SAT reading scores for the high school class of 2011 “were the lowest on record, and combined reading and math scores fell to their lowest point since 1995,” according to the College Board.
The current average reading score stands at 497, which is noticeably lower than the class of 2003’s score of 508 — the year No Child Left Behind went into effect.
This drop in scores could mean a multitude of things, but most importantly it signifies that students are not receiving enough assistance in secondary schools, and this lack of assistance could adversely affect their performance in competitive colleges such as USC.
In a society where many high school humanities curricula are based around teaching students how to produce five-paragraph essays and how to navigate tricky multiple-choice exams, the importance of seemingly simple reading skills is often neglected.
USC offers many reading-intensive courses making a high reading comprehension level necessary. Writing 140, the bane of every freshman’s existence, requires  proficiency in reading and, in turn, writing. Reading is integral to academic success in college, with many classes often requiring students to read up to 75 pages for each class. The national reading level must be raised for students to have a shot to keep up with the intense workload in college.
The comprehensive book reports, which implore students to gain an understanding of the books deeper than a SparkNotes analysis, has become a thing of the past.
To truly bolster the reading abilities of American youth, however, secondary school educators need to initiate programs and course requirements similar in nature to those of an elementary school curriculum so students can acquire the necessary skills to succeed in college.
One such initiative many schools have embraced as a successful and even enjoyable way of increasing literacy is the Accelerated Reader program that focuses on reading achievement rather than simply boosting reading test scores.
Providing such intensely personalized profiles for reading skills has paid off. Since Hawthorne Elementary School in Iowa implemented the AR program, the percent of fourth-graders who scored “proficient” on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills catapulted from 54 percent in fall 1998 to 91.6 percent in fall 2005.
What do these results prove? First, they show how important reading often is in overall improvement in critical thinking — a vital component for any college student. USC students, and all students in general, are constantly reading primary sources, textbooks, etc., and they’re expected to do so critically.
If a program such as AR were to be implemented in high schools, each student might be better equipped for the vigorous nature of college curricula.
According to CNN, the Department of Education has allotted $68.6 billion for its 2011 budget — money that should be used to install more AR programs because they are beginning to prove they work.
As of late, it’s becoming increasingly apparent SAT scores do affect college performance. Dean of Admission, Timothy Brunold, told the Daily Trojan “Test scores can help us predict how a student might perform academically at USC,” along with other carrying factors such as GPA.
So this sinking of test scores is alarming — could it perhaps be an indication students won’t be completely prepared for college academics at challenging universities like USC?
Interestingly, the College Board tried to downplay the significance of the sinking average scores, attributing the decline to an increase in “the record size and diversity of the pool of test-takers.”
The inflated number of students aiming for college, however, should not be viewed as justification for lower reading scores; Instead, it should motivate students and the educational system alike to focus more on reading skills.
Moreover, I find the College Board’s argument puzzling. Here at USC, the current freshman class is the most diverse to date, yet we are still far above the national average in SAT scores.
Reading is not a skill that can be properly quantified by a number on a test.
Educators need to do their part to ensure students are reading as extensively and as comprehensively as they can be — even if it means resorting to tried-and-true elementary school techniques.
The AR initiative could potentially affect the way a student performs in college.

Four USC students  are attempting to raise $20,000 by the end of October to travel to South Korea to film a documentary about a philanthropist working to save the lives of children who would otherwise be abandoned because of their deformities.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
 
As of Sept. 27, they had only been able to raise $3,000 — and if more money is not generated, the trip could be in jeopardy. Brian Ivie and Will Tober, two of the group’s leaders, remain optimistic of their chances to make the trip possible.
What struck me about this story was the USC School of Cinematic Arts’ lack of response in supporting two of its students clearly driven to explore the craft of moviemaking in a new and challenging location.
Though most programs and clubs have funding assistance, this incredible initiative surprisingly does not. Projects such as this one should be a university priority.
With programs like Student Opportunities for Academic Research and Summer Undergraduate Research Fund, USC allows students in a variety of majors to participate in projects related to their respective fields. USC also provides study abroad opportunities for students in almost every major. But when students in SCA, like Ivie and Tober, decide they want to pursue their curiosity in the same extracurricular context as thousands of other USC students, it seems as if the school has deviated from the university in terms of fiscal assistance.
Ivie and Tober are fighting to create more awareness about the kindness of Jong Rak Lee, a pastor in Seoul who has added a “drop box” to his house as an alternative for Korean parents who conform to the long-standing trend of abandoning deformed or unwanted children. They believe their film would help Lee in his mission.
If it weren’t for the philanthropic drive these students have, they might not have even managed to attain the $3,000 they have raised so far from friends and family. USC should further assist students to set an example. If a student sees this project fail, what message does that give off? It’s a deterrent when it should be inspiring.
Often, many things students want to pursue are thwarted by financial restrictions, leaving students at a disadvantage to interact with the world and their environments. This is why SCA should be more responsive; it must give off the message that student development transcends all else.
A solution to this issue would be to implement a simple program that offers grants for ambitious projects like this one.  It could be operated through the study abroad office and funded simply through alumni donations, ensuring money budgeted for other campus clubs and programs will remain intact.
SCA supports countless student filming projects each year with equipment and facilities. Since supporting student filmmakers is such a prominent part of the school, it leaves me confused as to why SCA does not offer more help to motivated students.
As further motivation for students to continue to spearhead innovative projects, extracurricular efforts such as this should count for major credit.
SCA and USC, in general, should provide enough support to the efforts of people like this to expand their focus beyond the local neighborhood. The maximum of one course per semester SCA accepts for study abroad credit is glaring, but the lack of support they are providing to projects such as this one is difficult to swallow.
It would be a tragedy if these students ultimately failed in such a constructive project when the university could have helped them in some way.

link to how we could get involved and support the project would be nice.. also, the issue with SCA is much larger than you make it out to be and surely involves industry standards and practices, which the school is forced to abide by due to its close proximity to and association with Hollywood. That being said, It would be amazing if there were opportunities available like you mention, but then, would we really be getting prepared to work in one of the most competitive industries if funding is never an issue and readily available at all times?

It is not uncommon to see men and women pushing carts laden with bacon-wrapped hot dogs or various ice cream cones in the area between USC and Exposition Park, particularly on game days.
A recent Los Angeles Times article highlighted the potential health hazards that should be considered when purchasing these items, as well as measures being taken to ensure health standards.
It is completely legal to sell food and other items on the street in Los Angeles, as long as the seller has the appropriate business and health permits. In order to maintain health standards, the city’s Public Health Department has begun issuing letter grades to food carts. Unfortunately, this measure does not stop illegal vendors from selling their goods on L.A. streets.
“An illegal vendor of hot dogs, for example, can make as much as $300 a day,” reported Hector Tobar in the Times. “That vendor’s licensed competitor might take in a bit more but has higher costs associated with keeping his food sanitary and has to pay ever-higher health-inspection fees.”
Legal street food vendors must go through a series of inspections — some unannounced — in order to attain their letter grades from the Public Health Department. Illegal vendors, or those who do not display the yellow PHD sticker on their cart, might not be complying with health standards in regards to the safety of their food.
The next time students feel the urge to buy a bacon-wrapped hot dog, they should look for a yellow health department sticker on the food cart. Without this yellow sign, the food could be tainted, old, or unrefrigerated — all undesirable things that could lead to a nasty bout of food poisoning.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident summary between Friday, Sept. 30, and Sunday, Oct. 2.
Crimes against a person
At 1:45 a.m. on Oct. 2, a student reported that a security guard at the 901 Bar & Grill placed him in a choke hold and another one flicked a lit cigarette at his face following an altercation inside the establishment, during which he discharged pepper spray in self defense. One of the guards refused to speak with DPS officers who responded to the scene and the second guard could not be located at the time of the report, so the matter was turned over to LAPD detectives for further investigation.
Crimes against property
At 2:03 p.m. on Sept. 30, a student approached a retail unit officer inside Pertusati University Bookstore and advised him that another student had picked up several items and placed them in a backpack he was carrying. The officer attempted to detain the student when he was observed exiting the store without paying for the merchandise, but the student ignored the officer and fled on foot. The student was detained by DPS officers who responded to the scene. They found him in possession of several items for which he had not paid. The student was then arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 12:17 p.m. on Oct. 1, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student who sustained a cut to the back of his head when he fell outside the Edward L. Doheny Jr. Memorial Library. Fire Safety personnel responded to treat the student and an LAFD unit was requested. LAFD Unit #15 took over treatment of the student and he was released at the scene after declining transportation for additional medical treatment.
At 8:46 a.m. on Oct. 1, DPS officers responded to a report of two suspects at the location selling parking spaces in private lots at 36th Place and Vermont Avenue without the owner’s permission. When questioned by the officers the suspects claimed they had the necessary permits to conduct their business and stated they would retrieve the documentation from another site. The suspects then left the scene and never returned.
At 2:48 a.m. on Oct. 1, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated non-USC female who was lost near Kappa Alpha Theta. The officers determined the female was unable to care for herself and they were unable to locate the student with whom she was staying or any other person who could take custody of her. The officers then arrested the female and transported her to 77th station for booking.
At 4:16 p.m. on Sept. 30, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect trespassing Theta Chi and detained him for investigation. A check of the suspect’s name revealed three outstanding warrants. He was arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.

ABC News declared Oct. 3  it is teaming up with Yahoo News to collaborate on news content, reporting materials and authentic videos.
Announced on Good Morning America and at a New York City press conference, the partnership revolves mainly around original video and is expected to reach 100 million people per month.
Good Morning America anchor George Stephanopoulos aired the new video series “Newsmakers” on Monday afternoon with an interview with President Obama. The interview streamed on both ABCNews.com and Yahoo.com. Other online series for the two companies that launched Monday include “Around the World with Christiane Amanpour” and “This Could Be Big,” hosted by Bill Weir.
The deal also addresses the method in which news is gathered. Though Yahoo News is the No. 1 online news site, its main news provider will be ABC News. Major news events and big projects will be covered by editorial teams of both companies however in order to maintain editorial control of their particular site.
Also joining forces are the ad sale teams of the two companies that will sell online video advertising. According to CNN.com, ABC will lead sales efforts during the busy “upfront” selling season and Yahoo will manage sales the rest of the year.
The alliance comes at at time when Yahoo is struggling to increase advertising revenue due to competition from Facebook and Google. It is currently searching for a successor to former Chief Executive Carol Bartz, who was fired last month. Yahoo is contemplating whether to sell all or least part of the company, but doing so would not affect its partnership with ABC News.

The music biz is on its toes right now as the second round of bidding for the auction of EMI Music draws near.
EMI, which holds labels such as Capitol Records and Parlophone Records, is being auctioned off by its current owner Citigroup after operating in the red for an untimely period of time.
But what is EMI? And what does this auction mean for the average music fan?
EMI is one of the largest record companies in the world and has a powerhouse catalogue. Think of the money it would cost to buy The Beatles, Queen, Coldplay and Katy Perry. Their recording and publishing contracts, the song and sound copyrights — this bidding war isn’t just another drop in the bucket. And yet with a catalogue as impressive and deep as this, EMI has been struggling to operate profitably.
But it’s no secret that EMI has struggled in the past. Recent evidence of the company’s strategy to recoup some lost income was manifested in the Beatles catalogue being available for purchase on iTunes. The decision was certainly influenced by Citigroup’s intention to recover money indebted by EMI.
While selling The Beatles’ records on iTunes has definitely achieved success, the biggest source of revenue for Citi will be selling publishing copyrights and the like from all of EMI’s artists.
The biggest players in the auction are Warner Music Group, Sony/ATV Music and BMG Rights Management. The plan after all is to sell the publishing division (EMI Music Publishing) separately from the EMI record company. This will allow Citigroup to attract more potential sellers and have a better chance of reaping the benefits of each division while avoiding some sort of “bundle deal.” After second-round bidding is completed Oct. 5, one company will be that much closer to being a whole lot bigger.
But fear not! Your favorite artists will likely stay on their respective labels and keep doing what they do best — making the music you want to hear. The only difference will be the parent record company and profiting off of album and single sales.

Professors discussed Monday how the differences between science and the public can be reconciled through a commitment to interdisciplinary practices.
“Science and Its Publics: Bridging the Divide,” part of USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ “Uncommon Conversations” event series, featured a panel of three faculty members from the USC Dornsife 2020 Research Cluster in Science, Technology & Society: K.C. Cole, a professor of journalism, Antonio Damasio, a professor of neuroscience and Deborah Harkness, a professor of history.
The panelists each provided an overview of their unique experiences negotiating the gap between science and society, as evidenced by the current controversy over issues such as stem cell research, vaccinations and evolution theory.
Andrew Lakoff, a professor of sociology and director of the Science, Technology & Society cluster who coordinated the event, said the event was part of a broader effort to introduce the work of all of the research clusters that make up the USC Dornsife 2020 Initiative.
USC Dornsife Dean Howard Gillman established Dornsife 2020 to encourage work across disciplines around relevant thematic clusters. Thematic clusters serve as the central point for new research initiatives and related academic programs to encourage interdisciplinary work among faculty within Dornsife.
Lakoff said the most immediate purpose of these clusters is to discover “… what needs should be addressed in our research and our teaching.”
According to the panelists, these needs centered on two main objectives: effective communication and unifying different academic and professional disciplines. In her overview, Cole discussed the necessity of appealing to the pathos of a public that otherwise might be turned off by the scientific community.
“The public isn’t stupid,” she said.
Cole said it is alienation that poses a bigger threat to an understanding between science and the public. She stressed that one cannot think without feeling, and scientists need to take that into account when attempting to communicate with society at large.
Harkness said her experience bridging the gap between science and the public mirrored her ongoing efforts to bridge the gap between science and the humanities.
In doing so, she echoed sentiments expressed by Lakoff on how the issues addressed by the panelists were intrinsically tied to the interdisciplinary academic approach.
Student participation in the discussion seemed to demonstrate the diversity of interdisciplinary interaction the panelists hope to achieve.
“It was going to address some of the matters we discussed in my Science, Technology & Social Conflicts class,” said Stephanie Gottlieb, a freshman majoring in business administration.
Jeremy Slap, a sophomore majoring in philosophy and neuroscience, said he attended the discussion because it is important to  know how to reconcile science to the public.
“You shouldn’t have to have a degree to understand basic life concepts,” he said.
Edwin Choi, a junior majoring in English, said he also saw the program as broadening his horizons.
“I hope to gain a better understanding of the effects of technology on society,” he said. “You have to educate the general public on important matters.”
Students said reconciling science and the public is an important topic to address in the modern world. This is an attitude Lakoff believes will soon manifest itself in classrooms at USC, if it hasn’t already.
“This could open up a conversation that becomes part of conversations in science classes at USC,” Lakoff said.

Though her graduating class voted her most likely to blow up a lab at her international high school in Geneva, Switzerland, Simca Bouma has managed to keep the fire in the lab under control. Her, however, proverbial fire for science has earned her a special honor.
Bouma, a senior majoring in mathematics and physics, is the first USC student to receive a scholarship from the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation. Jerry Carr, a U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame inductee and Skylab astronaut who received a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from USC in 1954, presented the $10,000 check to Bouma on Monday in Taper Hall.

Though the award was presented Monday, Bouma learned she was to receive the award last June.
“I was pretty astonished,” Bouma said. “It felt like I had done something; I thought my mom would be proud.”
Twenty-two USC students were nominated by the science, mathematics and engineering departments for the award. Nominees did not compete for the scholarships with students from other schools; every university that participated was guaranteed a winner.
This year 25 universities participated in the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation.
“Jerry Carr nominated us for inclusion this year,” Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs Gene Bickers said. “And we thank Jerry for bringing this scholarship opportunity to USC students.”
Not only is Bouma the first USC student ever to be selected for an Astronaut Scholarship, but she has received the largest merit-based monetary award that is given by the foundation to science and engineering undergraduate students in the United States.
“The goal of the foundation is to advance science and scientific progress in the United States and I guess they read that my goals coincided very well with theirs,” Bouma said.
Bouma has been involved in research for years.
After high school, she worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology observing properties of carbon nanotubes. The summer after her freshman year, Bouma returned to Switzerland, where she worked at the European Organization for Nuclear Research. She wrote, a computer program for the organizations accelerator. During a different summer, she worked in the electro-magnetic division of NIST.
Currently, Bouma is a Supplemental Instruction leader for Calculus II.
“I am helping first and second year students in the 100 level class,” Bouma said. “I make worksheets based on lecture material and answer their questions.”
Bouma ultimately wants to pursue a doctorate in theoretical physics once she earns her undergraduate degrees in mathematics and physics.
At the award ceremony, students and the public had the opportunity to hear Carr share his experiences as an astronaut after he presented the check to Bouma.
Carr was one of the 19 astronauts chosen by NASA to enter its program in April 1966, and since then he has made three space walks and circled the globe in orbit 214 times. He said Bouma’s leadership ultimately led her to become USC’s first Astronaut Scholar.
“She is a prime example of everything an Astronaut Scholar is supposed to be: intelligent, [persevering] and destined for greatness,” Carr said in a press release.
WOW!  Congratulations>  A rocket scientist!  Who wuda thunk it?
Congratulations, Simca.  That is a wonderful achievement and you deserve the scholarship for all your hard work and dedication.  Fight on!

Admission for transfer students at USC is becoming more selective, according to the Office of Admission.
Applications for admission increased by 131, while 26 fewer transfer students were actually accepted to USC for the 2011-2012 academic year.
“We’re seeing an increase in interest and an increase in the number of [applications] we’ve received,” said Dean of Admission Kirk Brennan.
The acceptance rate for transfer students decreased from 17.1 percent last year to 16.6 percent this year.
The Office of Admission said more transfer students enrolled in 2010 and 2011 than the university intended. The enrollment goal was 1,340 transfer students this year and 1,320 transfer students for the previous year.
The Office of Admission’s increased selectivity, however, brought the number of students enrolled this year closer to the target. Last year, 11.2 percent more transfer students enrolled than admissions had aimed for and this year, 6.6 percent more transfer students enrolled.
“Our concern is that we want to make sure we bring in enough students to keep the university full,” Brennan said. “But we don’t [want to] overfill [the university] to make it too crowded or difficult to get housing or food, and there are only so many classrooms and laboratories.”
Nicole Stockdale, a junior transfer student majoring in economics, said  the more selective transfer process increases the prestige of being a transfer student.
“[The increase in selectivity] is definitely more of a compliment for us as transfer students,” Stockdale said. “Often times I don’t tell people I’m a transfer student because they’ll think I got the easier way in.”
According to Zoe Roth, a junior transfer student majoring in narrative studies, transfer students benefit the university by adding their diverse experience to USC.
“Transfer students [use] their different college experience and bring it back to USC,” Roth said. “I’m very grateful [being at USC], since I always wanted to go to here from high school and, even though I didn’t get in, I still wanted to go and knew I wouldn’t settle.”
This makes me quite proud to be a USC transfer. It is very true that transfer students get a bad reputation and I truly believe that the transfer students are at times more ambitious, dedicated, and hardworking.

Alex Zenelenty and Will Ilgen, sophomores majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, protest in front of Tommy Trojan as part of the nationwide “Occupy Wall Street” rally to encourage dialogue between students and global financial leaders.
Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
I am quite pleased to see the OWS protests carried on here.
My thanks and admiration to those students and other participating everywhere.
My description of USC students is overbroad. There are those students that are selfish and materialistic, but not all.  Apologies to the rest of the community.
I support these protesters.  USC is one of the most materialistic, shallow college campuses in the entire United States (and likely the world).  For these guys to stand up in front of their largely vapid, disappointing peers and speak the truth is a sign of courage.  Stay strong brothers.

The USC Credit Union said it will not impose fees on customers for debit card transactions after national banks announced last Thursday they would begin charging customers a monthly fee for using their debit cards.
Fees · Some Bank of America customers said they will switch to USC Credit Union as a result of the newly imposed fees on debit card customers. - Megan Harmon | Daily Trojan
Bank of America, Corp. said it will charge $5 for every month certain customers (who have not yet been determined) who make transactions with their debit cards. Though Bank of America is the latest to come forth with new charges, other banks, including JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., are also experimenting with a similar $3 charge.
Michael Kim, USC Credit Union chief marketing officer, said as a non-profit financial cooperative USC Credit Union will not impose fees on its debit card customers.
“USC Credit Union does not and has no plans to implement debit card fees,” Kim said. “As a non-profit financial cooperative, we strive to provide the best financial products and services to our members at lower cost than banks. That includes free debit card use, no monthly fees on our Cardinal Checking account with no minimum balance or direct deposit requirements.”
Two-thirds of Americans use debit cards more frequently than credit cards, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll. When asked how they would react to a $5 fee, 66 percent said they would change payment methods.
Though Bank of America claims the cost is justified because it covers fraud and overdraft protection fees, the Federal Reserve says 21 cents is a realistic fee for a debit card sale.
USC Credit Union expects to see an increase in customers because of the new fees at other banks, Kim said.
“Based on these recent news items, we certainly expect to see an increase in new accounts and we’re focusing efforts to further promote membership to the Trojan Family,” Kim said.
Rachel King, a senior majoring in psychology, said she used to own a USC Credit Union card and a debit card, but canceled her debit card account after her bank began charging for transactions.
“I had both a [USC] Credit Union card and a debit card from my bank in Hawaii and then my bank in Hawaii started charging me extra fees so I’m solely a [USC] Credit Union customer now,” King said.
Though debit cards are more convenient, increased debit card fees can become a burden for college students, said Marisa Fentis, a senior majoring in psychology.
“It’s frustrating because with a debit card, it’s easier to keep track of what you’re spending, but with a credit card it’s easier to spend more and makes it more difficult to pay off,” Fentis said. “Banks are already randomly charging me fees for things I don’t know about, and as a working college student, I can’t afford to pay small fees like that.”
Kamil Massod, a junior majoring in biochemistry, said the fees are minimal and she will likely stay with Bank of America.
“If I were to spend $500 on something, five more dollars is 1 percent of that, so it’s not as big of a deal,” Massod said. The benefits of using it outweigh the cost. I’ll probably still keep my [Bank of America] account for larger purchases.”
