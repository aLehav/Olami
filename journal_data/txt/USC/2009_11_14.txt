USC had been embarrassed at home by Stanford before, but not like this.
Not in November. Not on homecoming. And certainly not by 34 points.
But behind the power running of senior running back Toby Gerhart, the No. 25 Cardinal (7-3) did, thoroughly overpowering the No. 11 Trojans, 55-21, in a shocker before 90,071 celebrating homecoming at the Coliseum.  Stanford’s 55 points were the most ever scored against USC.

“This feels really weird,” USC coach Pete Carroll said after the game.
It looked like things would go the Trojans’ way when they forced a three-and-out on Stanford’s first drive and immediately drove inside the Cardinal 20.
But freshman quarterback Matt Barkley fumbled a first-down snap under duress from the Stanford defensive line. From there, it was all Cardinal in the first quarter, as redshirt freshman quarterback Andrew Luck threw for one touchdown and Gerhart ran for another.
“We started really fast,” Luck said. “We knew it would be a tough game, but starting fast really helped.”
Gerhart consistently busted through the USC front seven, totaling 29 rushes for 178 yards and three touchdowns. He ran for nine first downs.
“We’ve seen him run the ball like that week in and week out, so we’ve just gotta tackle him,” junior linebacker Malcolm Smith said. “But he just got out.”
Opponents all season have mentioned Stanford’s physicality, especially when running the ball. The Cardinal overpowered Oregon a week ago with 254 yards on the ground. This time, they had 325.
“That’s something that we have to do as a team: be physical and play physical,” Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh said in his postgame press conference. “And we do other stuff offensively that compliments the physical side.”
Luck, Harbaugh’s 19-year-old signal-caller and admitted protégé, outplayed his freshman counterpart Barkley, completing 12-of-22 passes for 144 yards and two touchdowns to Barkley’s 21-of-31 for 196 yards and a touchdown. The biggest difference was Barkley’s three interceptions — all three of which resulted in Stanford touchdowns.
Barkley said after the game that he probably shouldn’t have thrown at least one of them. The picks served to stymie USC’s running game, which was mostly effective.
Junior running back Joe McKnight carried the ball 16 times for 142 yards and a touchdown, but the Trojans again failed to convert a total of eight third and fourth-down opportunities.
“One of the big things was to be able to stop the running game,” Harbaugh said. “We didn’t stop it, USC popped some runs, but for the most part it wasn’t 10, 10, 10. We got some stops and some sacks.”
USC had fostered some momentum after a Taylor Mays fumble recovery gave the Trojans the ball on the Cardinal 36, down 21-7 in the third quarter.
Barkley then delivered a 36-yard touchdown strike to redshirt freshman receiver Brice Butler to make the score 21-14.
But Stanford would answer back with a methodical 10-play drive capped off by a 6-yard touchdown run by Luck.
“That was a big momentum shift, and when I caught it I was like ‘Let’s go,’ now that we’d scored,” said Butler, making his first career start in place of the injured Damian Williams. “The whole team was feeling that way.
“Then, it kinda died down.”
USC would score once more, but Stanford again responded quickly. The Cardinal’s last five drives all ended in touchdowns.
With the 34-point loss, USC has been outscored 174-131 in its last five games.
This is also the first time since Carroll’s first year, 2001, that the Trojans have lost three games in one season.
“Things are looking nasty right now,” Smith said.
USC’s last three home losses have all been against Stanford, but the Trojans said that didn’t matter.
“Any team that beats us, they’re surprised,” Butler said. “They didn’t think it was gonna happen.”
Stanford’s Gerhart, a member of the 2007 team that upset the Trojans 24-23 at the Coliseum, agreed to a certain extent.
“I was surprised a little bit,” Gerhart said. “They’re USC and have been the premier Pac-10 team.
“We’ve been the underdogs.”
But while Stanford stays in the thick of the Pac-10 championship race, the Trojans are essentially eliminated from BCS bowl and Pac-10 title contention. They must now face the likelihood of a pre-New Year’s bowl game.
But for now, the Trojans have a bye-week break before crosstown rival UCLA comes to town on Nov. 28.
“If you think about it, it probably comes at the perfect time,” Butler said. “We lost, and now we have to sit here and think about it for two weeks.”

Birds circled the Coliseum after the game, but they might as well have been vultures, swooping in to prey on the dying legacy of the once-mighty Trojans.
This is really it. It’s over.
USC’s claim to the title of college football’s most dominant team officially came crashing down Saturday when Stanford unabashedly dismantled the Trojans, 55-21.
Daily Trojan | Mannat Saini
Oregon was just the beginning. Stanford was the confirmation.
The torch has been passed. USC’s reign atop the college football world and the Pac-10 is officially done for.
This statement could have been written after the shellacking in Eugene, Ore. But after Oregon’s subsequent loss and USC’s belief that anything could happen, people inserted USC back into Rose Bowl consideration.
Now, as USC used to gloriously proclaim, it left no doubt. Goodbye Rose Bowl, hello Sun Bowl — if that.
There was no tricky spread offense like the Ducks used to blast the Trojans on Halloween. There was no hostile crowd.
USC knew what was coming and they couldn’t do anything about it. All the Trojans could do was throw their hands in the air and concede, just like the rest of the conference used to do for them.
“They ran the plays we thought they were gonna run,” senior safety Taylor Mays said. “They ran power lead. It wasn’t complicated or intricate like Oregon’s offense at all.”
Stanford running back Toby Gerhart plowed through USC’s defense again and again, finishing with 181 yards on 21 carries and three touchdowns.
Gerhart, who USC coach Pete Carroll compared to Jerome “the Bus” Bettis earlier in the week, looked the part. And the entire USC defense went along for the ride.
“They blocked us — time, after time, after time, after time,” Carroll said.
USC appeared one step behind on nearly every play.
The Trojans were not able to dig themselves out a bad start like we’ve seen so many times in the past when they’ve fallen behind at home.
They were not able shore up the defense and stop the barrage either —  Stanford just kept coming at them, not stopping until it put up 55 points, the most USC has ever given up.
Stanford recognized this was not the same USC team of old.
“Everything wasn’t there,” Stanford cornerback Richard Sherman said. “It didn’t seem like they were playing as hard as they usually do.”
This USC team just didn’t have the same fight.
“In years past, you saw them destroy people,” Sherman said. “It didn’t matter what the score was, they were going to put 100 on everybody.”
In case you didn’t check your calendar, the game was played in November, a month in which Carroll had never lost.
Winning in November meant USC was always getting better every week.
Winning in November meant USC continued to peak while the rest of the nation was leveling off.
But to lose in such a lopsided way at home, in Carroll’s month and on Homecoming signifies the end of an era.
The end of that streak is a symbol for the end of USC’s hegemony.
“The whole thing about November, I’ve never even known why that existed,” Carroll said. “But as a competitor, I freakin’ loved it. I loved the fact that we finished better than other teams.”
Carroll hates to see the streak end because it now puts USC in the “other teams” category. The man who is penning a book called Win Forever just found out that dominance has its limits.
Trojan fans also expected Carroll to be able to rebuild forever — to keep dominating even when they had to replace NFL-caliber players, year in and year out.
Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley was spectacular at times this season but Saturday he showed he is not ready to be hold this team together yet.
The boundless expectations placed on the 19-year old were unfair and we all saw why first hand. Barkley threw three bad interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown, and also fumbled on USC’s first drive.
“I’m not used to this. It doesn’t feel right,” Barkley said after the game.
The inexperienced linebacker unit has held tough this season, but they couldn’t  — and shouldn’t have been — expected to play like the four NFL players who played those positions last season.
Eventually, a team, no matter how great, finds itself on the other side. Sooner or later, the score is evened and the pendulum swings.
Because no one stays on top forever.
Cycles. Study history and you study cycles, no matter what you’re looking at. It certainly applies to sports teams, so let’s keep in mind that “It’s over” always means “It’s over until it returns.”
Pete Carroll is still the best college football coach in the nation, and maybe the best there’s ever been. Now, though, we get to see how he goes about doing something USC fans haven’t had to see him do before; bring the team back from a serious fall from the top of the college football heap.
Wait, correct that. To give Washington, Oregon and Stanford the credit they deserve, this isn’t a fall from dominance. It’s a forced removal.
Personally, I’m confident that Coach Carroll will get the team together for a return to the top.
Rise and fall. It’s a cycle.
Sam Wolfe:  dude, I really hope you’re not a USC student.  YOUR POST IS BADLY WRITTEN AND NONSENSICAL.
Yeah I ran through that one…but this wasn’t for an essay grade DUDE… I’m not a student either… Just a big USC fan and I’m trying to stop the hate on the Trojans from other bloggers when they lose.. Is this sensible for you… go dissect some other bloggers from ESPN, L.A. Times, etc…

The setup: After finishing off the last of their away games, the road-weary Trojans returned to the Coliseum in hopes of solidifying their standing in the Pac-10.
The story: Stanford made itself at home on homecoming day for USC by running roughshod over the Trojans in a 55-21 blowout. The 34-point loss was the worst in the Coliseum in almost 43 years for USC.
Daily Trojan | Mannat Saini
“I’m not sure I have the right words to describe being humbled like this,”
Stanford racked up 325 yards rushing and was led by senior running back Toby Gerhart, who tallied 178 yards and three touchdowns. The Norco, Calif., product was only recruited as a fullback and linebacker by USC coaches, who believed he would not be able to be a running back in the Pac-10.
But Gerhart ran through the heart of the Trojan defense all day behind Stanford’s gritty offensive line. The Cardinal repeatedly utilized the power play, as coaches and players called it, to get Gerhart moving downhill.
Stanford’s offensive success was all the more startling given the few number of surprises they offered.
“They ran the same plays we thought they were going to run,” senior safety Taylor Mays said.
Saturday’s outcome was the latest in a frustrating series for USC’s maligned defense. Last week’s performance against Arizona State gave the Trojans reason for confidence, but Carroll said that he did not think his team had solved its glaring errors.
“We’ve just fallen apart here and given our opponents the chance to do whatever they want,” he said.
Barkley’s struggles: True freshman quarterback Matt Barkley threw a career-high three interceptions and fumbled once against the Cardinal.
With wide receiver Damian Williams sidelined by ankle injury, Barkley finished with fewer than 200 passing yards for the third straight game.
The recent woes perplexed the signal-caller, who said he would have to look at film to determine the source of his struggles.
“I don’t feel flustered,” Barkley said. “We’ve had some bad breaks. When we’re turning the ball over like this, it’s tough to bounce back.”
Barkley’s most costly mistake came when a pass intended for Brice Butler was intercepted by Stanford cornerback Richard Sherman, who then streaked 43 yards down the sideline for a touchdown. The score gave Stanford a decisive 42-21 lead with less than 12 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter.
“He looked like a kid,” Sherman said. “He’s a great quarterback and he’s going to make great plays, but everybody has to grow.”
The call: Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh surprised many with a fourth-quarter decision to attempt a two-point conversion with the game well in-hand after Gerhart’s third touchdown put the Cardinal up 48-21. Gerhart was stopped short of the goal line, but Harbaugh’s move still drew plenty of questions following the game.
“I think he was trying to go for 50,” Gerhart said with a smile.
Carroll said he was not offended by the decision and did not address it in the postgame handshake.
“In that situation, they can do whatever they want,” Carroll said. “Sometimes those decisions are for attitude and your own team, so you do what you have to do.”
The decision did grate some USC players, however.
“It was kind of dispectful,” junior linebacker Malcolm Smith said. “It was definitely a punch in the face.”
Insult to injury: Mays’ postgame press conference was drowned out by the sounds of Stanford hollering and knocking against their lockers, rattling the wall.
“They deserve to have that feeling,” Mays said.
2 pt conversion was a good b-tch slap to pete carroll for what he’s done in the past to other football programs. Not to mention how arrogant this guy is.  He also had the balls to say the f-word to Oregon’s coach Belotti a couple years ago.
Karma is sweet.
Good article, but two corrections: 1) Toby Gerhart was injured and did not play in the 2007 game at USC. 2) Freshman backup Stepfan Taylor, not Toby, was the running back on the failed 2 point conversion.
USC KNEW WITH ONE LOSS OR EVEN 12-0, THEY WASN’T GOING TO THE TITLE GAME.. THE SYSTEM HAS TO MAKE RIGHT WITH TEXAS NOT PLAYING FLORIDA LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF ALL THAT MESS WITH THE SOONERS, TEXAS TECH, TEXAS, ETC… ABOUT WHO BEAT WHO AND CAN BEAT WHO ETC…. USC KNEW OHIO STATE WAS COMING TO PASADENA- THEY HATE THAT BIG 10 ALLEGIANCE.. WE PLAYED STATE TWICE.. THREE TIMES IS OLD.. NEED NEW FLAVOR.. PETE KNEW WHAT WAS DOING.. HE NEEDED TO KEEP LOSING AND OREGON OR STANFORD TO KEEP WINNING.. HE JUST WASN’T COUNTING ON THREE LOSSES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN THATS ALL..
