Off to its best start since the 2004-2005 season, the USC women’s basketball team is poised to return to the NCAA tournament for the first time in five years.
The Women of Troy (12-4, 4-1) had a strong case for an at-large bid last season, but were unexpectedly omitted from the field of 64. According to USC coach Michael Cooper, last season’s snub has helped fuel the team this season.
Conference play · Senior guard Jacki Gemelos and the rest of the women’s basketball team will face Cal and No. 4 Stanford this week. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“We want something that we didn’t get last year, and that’s the opportunity to play with 63 other teams [in the NCAA tournament],” Cooper said.
Standing in their way is a road trip to the Bay Area, where two of the top teams in the Pac-10 reside. Today, the Women of Troy take on California, a physical team that should test USC’s recently discovered rebounding prowess.
Last season, opponents outrebounded USC by more than four rebounds per game.
This year, those numbers are reversed, and the difference could be the addition of freshman forward Cassie Harberts.
The star freshman totaled 30 rebounds in the two games against the Oregon schools and has provided USC with another interior presence to complement senior center Kari LaPlante.
“She’s starting to find her way through it,” Cooper said. “I think Cassie hit the wall a couple of weeks ago, but she’s starting to get her second wind.”
Whether that will help USC take down Cal (10-6, 2-3) remains to be seen, though junior guard Ashley Corral said it would come down to defense.
“Everything starts with defense for us,” Corral said. “If we can get a stop that will lead to our offense.”
Cal notched 24 wins and finished fourth in the conference last season, but the big test for USC this trip is a showdown Saturday against No. 4 Stanford, which has won nine of the past 10 conference titles.
The Cardinal (14-2, 5-0) beat USC by a combined score of 159-99 last season and return junior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike, the reigning Pac-10 conference player of the year.
History aside, Corral said the Stanford game would come down to execution.
“We have to take care of the little things,” she said. “They’re a very smart team. They’re not the most athletic team, but they do everything perfectly.”
Joining Ogwumike and a heralded freshman class is a deep and experienced team that stormed to an undefeated conference record last season.
The Cardinal outscored conference opponents by 24 points per game last season and added the country’s top recruit, freshman forward Chiney Ogwumike, to the mix.
“We’re not worried about what other teams [do],” Corral said. “We have to focus on ourselves.”
Despite its 4-1 conference record, a number of teams are nipping at the Trojans’ heels in the conference standings, and Cooper has stressed the importance of his team continuing its early-season momentum.
“There are a lot of good teams in the Pac-10,” he said. “The Arizona schools are right there. So is Cal. Every game is a [measuring stick for us].”

In his pre-game interview, USC coach Bill Ferguson indicated that No. 7 UC Irvine’s mediocre record belied a team that was only a few minor lineup adjustments away from surging.
On Wednesday night, his words would prove prophetic as the Anteaters (3-4, 1-2) competed valiantly for a stretch, until falling to the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team in four sets, 25-16, 27-25, 27-29, 25-17.
“It wasn’t the most well-played game, but I think we showed some grit and some mental toughness there, and that was really the theme of our talk after the game,” Ferguson said.
Indeed, the Trojans (3-0, 3-0) scheduled a difficult opponent for their first match away from the Galen Center, but to deserve a No. 1 seed teams must win consistently regardless of the environment.
Padding his early Player of the Year candidate credentials, senior opposite Murphy Troy registered 19 kills, 11 digs and two blocks. Aiding Troy was another perpetual stat-sheet stuffer in junior opposite hitter Tony Ciarelli, who chipped in with 17 kills, five blocks and five digs.
“They were good the whole game, battled real well,” Ferguson said of his two star players. “Irvine was keying on both of those guys. However, a guy who really came in and did a phenomenal job was [senior opposite hitter] Tri Bourne.”
Bourne entered for sophomore opposite hitter Maddison McKibbin two-thirds of the way through the second set, when the Trojans were trailing 23-19. He proceeded to amass eight kills and five digs over the duration of the match to solidify the Trojans’ offensive attack and propel them to a comeback in that crucial second set.
A refrain among USC players before this game was that their focus could not waver and that any No. 1-ranked team will receive its opponent’s fiercest effort.
When asked if his team followed through on its expressed mission, Ferguson quickly dispelled any notion that the Trojans took the Anteaters lightly. Instead, he attributed poor execution and unforced errors to many of their woes.
“We’ll never overlook [Irvine],” Ferguson said. “They’re too good. They played well, and after the end of the first set it was really close.”
Undoubtedly, the Trojans’ resilience was tested for the first time all season in this game, and if this team demonstrates similar resolve in future matches, the Trojans may have the mettle to excel in the long haul.
“I’m most proud of the fact that we turned the game right around in the fourth set, and really steadied out and did our thing,” Ferguson said. “We made plays like we did in the first set.”

A new decade means new beginnings, and for the USC men’s basketball program, it could only signal a change from the bitter, not too distant past.
Following the resignation of former coach Tim Floyd in 2009, the USC basketball team was in shambles.
Former guard O.J. Mayo was found to have received improper benefits and the university decided to self-impose sanctions on a basketball program already trying to cope with the loss of starters DeMar DeRozan, Taj Gibson and Daniel Hackett, who declared for the NBA Draft.
Not only did USC lose these three players, but eight recruits decided to bolt for a better situation than the one they originally had signed up for.
The aforementioned sounds like the perfect recipe for a disaster, and that’s surely where it seemed like the Trojans basketball program was headed.
Enter Kevin O’Neill (aka K.O.).
“We’re thrilled to have Kevin O’Neill as our men’s basketball coach,” former athletic director Mike Garrett said in a release at the time of the hire. “Kevin is the consummate coach. He knows his Xs and Os, he’s an excellent recruiter and he is very in tune with the academic side of a player’s collegiate experience.”
Though Garrett might have seen it a bit differently, O’Neill had often been known more for his maniacal character and his constant barrage of four-letter bombs than his coaching resume.
But coming to USC, he had one job to do, and one job only.
Don’t bleep this one up.
For a program reeling from sanctions, the loss of NBA-eligible players and lost recruits, a .500 season in his first year at the helm would have been considered a success.
With no pressure to fulfill any sort of expectations, O’Neill exceeded my wildest dreams, leading USC to a 16-14 record.
And had it not been for a five-game losing streak to end the year, the Trojans would have been in the thick of the Pac-10 regular season title race.
Talk about tempering expectations, but O’Neill also gave the Trojan faithful a glimmer of hope for a brighter future.
Then, it was déjà vu all over again.
Forward Leonard Washington was dismissed from the team right after the 2009-2010 season ended, and reports mentioned he and K.O. weren’t exactly buddy-buddy.
A few months later, Washington announced his decision to transfer.
Next up: Freshman center Davis Rozitis.
Though Rozitis was a big work in progress, the 7-foot reserve’s intent to transfer wasn’t exactly clear-cut.
But given the track record O’Neill has compiled over the years, it’s not a far-fetched idea to examine and see that he is well-known for more than just his crazy style of coaching, but also player turnover.
Even at Arizona, it was well documented that he didn’t exactly see eye-to-eye with former Wildcats and current NBA players Jerryd Bayless and Chase Budinger.
One player who spoke anonymously went as far as to label him bipolar.
“He’s a great guy off the court, but he’s bipolar or something,” the player said. “On the court, he’s a madman.”
Now with the news that freshman guard Bryce Jones is set to transfer, this can only mean one thing for the USC basketball program: Trouble.
Jones’ transfer implies playing time was an issue, and it’s no wonder, since his minutes gradually decreased ever since receiving a technical foul against Lehigh.
An already tight rotation shrinks from eight to seven, and that becomes an issue when your starting guards and forwards already average nearly 35 minutes per contest.
I hate to say it, but before spring break, this current roster will be run into the ground, which is similar to what happened during O’Neill’s coaching stint in Arizona.
But though the health of the players might seem like a big deal, a bigger impact might be felt on the recruiting trail.
O’Neill managed to bring in a 2010 recruiting class that featured an ESPNU 100 player in Jones, along with freshmen forwards Garrett Jackson and Curtis Washington, who both ranked in the top 100 at their positions.
Now we have one recruit gone, and two left sitting snug on the bench.
For next year, K.O. nabbed forward Byron Wesley, who is the 43rd ranked player at his position, and for the 2012 class, three ESPNU Super 60 players are considering USC.
That’s some top-notch talent, but who wants to play for a coach who doesn’t utilize that talent, and doesn’t have a good relationship history with his players?
Not me — I’d rather take my talents to South Beach.
A season that looked so promising after a convincing victory against crosstown rival UCLA has now made a 180-degree turn in just a week and a half.
Two very disappointing losses at Oregon and Oregon State, combined with the news of Jones’ transfer surely isn’t helping.
Kevin O’Neill, you came in and steered a program in the right direction.
You put USC basketball back on the map in Los Angeles, reminding everybody we can compete on the hardwood too.
And you recruited enough talent to make the future look bright.
Now, my advice to you is simple:
Don’t bleep this one up.
 
“In The Zone” runs Thursdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Trevor at trevor.wong@usc.edu.
I agree with Tommy Trojan.  Coach has a tough job.  Sure I was disappointed in Oregon losses & the Cal defeat.
We will return.  Great University, Great facility, and if the Students support the program like they did against ucla, and we continue to recruit well……Coach will have depth and reason to play more players..
Keep Fighting On!!
The only thing “bleeped” up is this article.  Of course, as every good DT journalist knows, secondary sources are always the best way to get at the truth.  If you can’t get it straight from the horse’s mouth, why not get it from the people who have issues with the horse.
You guys kill me.  Half of you have no understanding of what it takes to be a part of a Division I athletic program, but you think that watching four hours of ESPN gives you enough credentials to speak about a coach or player’s ability and credentials.

Players such as Washington State’s guard Klay Thompson and Washington’s guard Isaiah Thomas give opposing coaches headaches by seemingly scoring at will.
USC coach Kevin O’Neill has a simple solution for stopping the opponent’s leading scorer: assigning senior guard Marcus Simmons to defend him.
Comeback · Thursday’s game against Stanford will be USC’s first this season without Bryce Jones, who announced Tuesday he was transferring. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“Marcus Simmons is becoming as good of a defensive stopper in college as you can have,” O’Neill said.
Simmons does not have to score frequently — his 5.2 points per game average is the lowest among USC’s starters, but he can be counted on to relentlessly defend the opponent’s best player, regardless of position.
“He has a single-mindedness about him,” O’Neill said. “If you give him one thing to do, he does it exceptionally well.”
Simmons held Thompson, the Pac-10’s leading scorer who has a .476 shooting percentage, to 6 for 18 shooting.
Despite being 6-foot-6, he guarded speedy 5-foot-9 guard Isaiah Thomas, who only managed to finish with 10 points and a game-high six turnovers.
Against UCLA, Simmons held forward Tyler Honeycutt to 10 points and forced him into seven turnovers, which tied his season high.
In USC’s win against Texas, forward Jordan Hamilton, who averages 19.2 points per game, only scored 12 points.
“I think I can guard anybody,” Simmons said.
When USC hosts Stanford tonight at 7:30 p.m., Simmons will likely be matched-up against guard Jeremy Green, whose 15.5 points-per-game average leads the team and ranks sixth in the Pac-10.
“Jeremy Green, in my mind, has a chance to be a NBA player,” O’Neill said. “He is a level up even from some of the guys that we have played. Marcus has been a tremendous stopper for us, and we hope that he does the same kind of job on Jeremy on Thursday.”
The Cardinal (10-6, 3-2) opened Pac-10 competition with convincing wins against California and Arizona State before losing two of its next three games.
Forward Josh Owens averages 12.1 points and a team-leading 6.5 rebounds for Stanford. His .619 field goal percentage ranks second in the Pac-10.
Tonight’s game will be the first without freshman guard Bryce Jones, who announced that he intends to transfer, citing playing time as one of the reasons that he is leaving.
“We will have to play somebody else in the eighth spot [in the rotation], but I do not know who that will be,” O’Neill said. “We are basically a rotation of seven now instead of eight unless somebody else starts to come along.”
Freshman forward Garrett Jackson and senior guard Donte Smith are expected to get more minutes off the bench, with freshman forward Curtis Washington possibly filling the eighth spot.
Jones averaged 7.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in 18 games, including 10 starts. He was second on the team in three-point baskets made and steals.

USC officials, headed by athletic director Pat Haden, will appeal to the NCAA Infractions Appeal Committee on Saturday in Indianapolis.
President C. L. Max Nikias, Vice President for Athletic Compliance David Roberts and the university’s lawyers will join Haden.
The NCAA cited USC for “a lack of institutional control” in June, the verdict coming after a four-year investigation.
Expecting the worst · Because of changes made to NCAA bylaws in 2008, athletic director Pat Haden has publicly stated on multiple occasions that USC’s chances for a successful appeal remain rather bleak. - Anna Wierzbowska | Daily Trojan 
The ruling came after the NCAA determined that Reggie Bush, a Heisman-trophy winning running back from 2003-2005, and O.J. Mayo, a standout shooting guard who attended USC for the 2007-2008 season, received improper benefits.
The NCAA put USC on probation for four years. The football program got a two-year bowl ban, a reduction of 30 scholarships over three seasons and was forced to vacate 14 victories in which Bush participated after he started receiving benefits.
The USC basketball program imposed a one-year postseason ban on itself before the ruling, so the NCAA took no further action against it.
USC wants Haden and company  to request that parts of the football team’s punishment be cut in half. They want the two-year bowl ban to be cut to one and the loss of 30 scholarships to be reduced to 15. The Trojans, who finished 8-5 in 2010, already served the first year of the postseason ban.
USC will not dispute other parts of the NCAA punishment, which include returning Bush’s replica Heisman trophy, taking down any image of Bush or Mayo around campus and the vacation of 14 wins in football.
If USC’s appeal is successful, the Trojans could be eligible for a bowl game at the end of the upcoming season and will lose only five scholarships per season over the next three years.
Haden has said the University’s primary goal is to recover some of the lost scholarships, according to ESPN.
USC must demonstrate that the punishment was excessive to the point that it “constitutes an abuse of discretion” by the NCAA, rather than that the punishment was wrong according to the evidence. The “abuse of discretion” requirement, which makes it much harder to win an appeal, has been in place since the NCAA changed its bylaws in 2008. Since that time, only one appeal out of 11 has been successful.
Because of the controversial rulings made by the NCAA in favor of Auburn quarterback Cam Newton and Ohio State quarterback Terrelle Pryor, however, USC might still have a shot at winning the appeal.
But the NCAA released statements last month emphasizing that none of the rulings have anything to do with one another, which means the Newton or Pryor rulings might not technically be taken into account in deciding USC’s appeal.
It is unclear when the results of the appeal will be announced.
the NCAA’s ruling on Cam Newton was and is a total joke, the fact that family matters can do whatever they want in soliciting money on behalf of their kids, and all the kid has to do is claim he had “no knowledge” is ludicrous.  The NCAA is and always has been a joke.
USC’s request for scholarship retention is not unreasonable. Many other schools have players (i.e. student athletes from low-income families) who receive benefits from agents. Reggie Bush just got caught, because he changed agents and faced a lawsuit.
Hasn’t this been USC’s pattern in the past? Win a few championships…a few Heisman’s….then go on probation for a few years…then start the process again.
3) They sue the NCAA
Now, that’s not only funny, but stupid.    I hope you get what you ask for, because you may not like it.    If you sue the NCAA they get get supeona power.    Do you really want the NCAA to be able to compel testimony?   They would likely find much more…….death penalty material.      
USC has used every advantage (private school) they could get not to cooperate.  But, step right up with your law suit.
Ohio State will likely not be punished any further than the suspensions that have already been levied. Auburn will still be under investigation, and there’s a likelihood that they will get the tar beat out of them if the school or any of its boosters is found guilty of paying for Newton’s services.  At least that’s my guess.
Why should their appeal be successful???? USC got caught cheating. 
Lane Kiffin is a clown and will be gone in 3 years or less. $4 million a year after posting records of 15–11 (college) and 5–15 (NFL) ???????????
There are only three ways I see this going in USC’s favor.
1) They join the SEC
2) They bribe the committee
3) They sue the NCAA
No way the NCAA commitee is going to be favorable to a west coast team, sorry, ain’t gonna happen.

It is hard to ignore the fanfare that carried Freebirds to our  campus grounds.
Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock, you’ve likely noticed the giant inflated burrito balloon, Lady Liberty freewheeling on a gleaming motorcycle and the enthusiastic dudes strutting around Figueroa and Jefferson with guitar-shaped Freebirds signs.
Burrito madness · Freebirds is similar to Chipotle in its style but distinguishes itself with its large sizes and fresh quality ingredients. - Kimberly Barnhill | Daily Trojan 
Freebirds has roared back into California, returning for the first time since it moved from its original location at Isla Vista in Santa Barbara, Calif. to Texas in 1987. Freebirds’ outrageous portions and rock and roll decor attracted a devoted fan base, allowing it to expand to more than 30 locations throughout the Lone Star State.
When Freebirds opened at  USC last Thursday, lines snaked well out the door. The lines might reflect the hype, but it’s only the food that will determine whether they will continue to be seen weeks after the initial novelty has worn off.
From the taste of it, it seems like Freebirds is all it’s rumored to be.
Even if you aren’t hungry, once you enter Freebirds and breathe in the smell of smoking meats, the tortilla wraps hissing in the grill and the masa chips sizzling in the fryer, you will be.
You’ll hear the buzz and excited chatter, happy eaters comparing burrito sizes and the cheerful servers coaxing you to try their guacamole, and before you know it, you’ll be fantasizing about your own masterpiece burrito.
At Freebirds, you are as free as a bird to create your own customized meal. Similar to Chipotle, you pick and choose which ingredients you want in your burrito, taco, burrito bowl, quesadilla, nachos or salad.
But for the full, bona-fide Freebirds experience, stick to the burrito.
Queue up, tell the front worker your desired burrito size (Hybrid, Freebird, Monster or Super Monster) and choose your preferred wrap (flour, wheat, spinach or cayenne). A server will then  guide you through the entire process of designing your dream burrito.
The base protein choice is steak, carnitas, dark or white chicken, crispy fish or vegetables.
From there, you’re given free reign on the bonus additions: Cilantro or Spanish rice? Cheddar or jack cheese? Black, pinto or refried beans? Or perhaps all? Or none?
You also get various “freebies” — basic fixings such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions, various salsas, jalapenos and cilantro along with a selection of eight sauces ranging from creamy ranch to fiery habanero.
You can’t go wrong with any of these ingredients. All are fresh and the meat choices are lean yet juicy and marbled with flavor. The steak is smoky, the carnitas melt-in-your-mouth tender, the chicken plump and the fish flaky yet crispy from its breadcrumb coating.
Be sure to ask for the corn salsa, which appears to have been shucked from the cob just before being grilled. The corn nibs stick to each other in a neat row, and the edges are beautifully charred and caramelized. A healthy spoonful adds a juicy-sweet bite, a lovely contrast to your savory meats.
Unfortunately, as far as chips go, the ones at Freebirds are just above mediocre. Though crispy and much more satisfying than store-bought bagged chips, they lack the intriguing zing of Chipotle’s lime-spiked chips. The guacamole that comes with them reeks of too much garlic and onion, not something you want to eat before a discussion class.
If you want the biggest bang for your buck, order the Super Monster: A mammoth sized, seven-pound edible brick sculpted from two super-large tortilla wraps with your choice of filling shoveled in.
Priced at about $13, the Super Monster is a decidedly economical investment, nearly three times the size of the $5.29 Hybrid. Unless you’ve got a wood-chipper for a stomach, you probably won’t be able to finish it in one sitting, but divided into three parts, the herculean burrito would make a satisfying lunch, dinner and midnight munchie. (To reheat your leftover burrito, just rewrap it in its foil wrapper and stick it into oven at 350-degrees for about 10 minutes, or squash it into your George Foreman grill.)
Freebirds is neither free nor particularly cheap, and it doesn’t leave you feeling like a bird (especially if you’ve just polished off a Super Monster), but its fresh, quality food and friendly servers that make it worthy of all the fanfare.
Great article. One note though; “Freebirds has roared back into California, returning for the first time since it moved from its original location at Isla Vista in Santa Barbara, Calif. to Texas in 1987” is misleading. The location in Santa Barbara still exists. USC’s Freebirds is the second in the state.

Starbucks Coffee will be rolling out a new, gargantuan, 31-ounce “Trenta” drink size to all Starbucks stores in the United States by May 3.
Cue the collective groans of every dietician in America.
The Trenta release comes in response to the consumer demand for bigger iced drinks perfect for those long, hot summer days.
Starbucks | Creative Commons
Thankfully, you won’t be able to pick up a 31-ounce Frappuccino any time soon, since the size is restricted to iced teas and coffees, with the usual choices of sweeteners, milk and cream.
Even Starbucks had the common sense to know that America doesn’t need 31 ounces of caramel macchiato.
Here’s the kicker, though: The Trenta, with a volume of 916 ml, is bigger than the average capacity of the human stomach, which is about 900 ml.
Do we really need to be lugging around icy beverages that have more liquid than the average stomach would like to hold? Granted, a stomach stretches, but the image is weirdly grotesque.
The size of the new Trenta pales in comparison to some of the convenience store options out there, but to see such a drink come from Starbucks? C’mon.
Coffeehouses are meant to be cool, dignified and sophisticated, regardless of whether any of those adjectives fit Starbucks anymore. The rise of the espresso drink, formerly an accessory of the stereotypical European-Italian, brought with it a certain appeal. An appeal threatened by what appears to be a slow march toward the 7-11 OMGWTF-Gulp, or whatever they’re calling it these days.
Even ignoring the oxymoronic nature of Starbucks following lowbrow “bigger is better” consumer trends, there is something very silly about introducing such an enormous drink size to the public. Everything is already too big. Portion sizes have grown across the board in America, distorting our sense of what’s properly portioned and what’s just way too large.
The average drink size twenty to thirty years ago was about eight ounces, according to The New York Times. Now? It’s somewhere around 20 ounces. Such increases have left us with more than a quenched thirst: The number of obese people in the United States has doubled since the 1970s.
With every increase in portion size, we start to lose sight of how much we’re supposed to eat. And one of the easiest fixes to this literal and metaphoric ballooning of America? Food establishments simply offering smaller portions.
The irony of this, when it comes to Starbucks, is that while they’re willing to unveil a new drink size that could satisfy a baby blue whale, they still hide their smallest available size, the eight-ounce Short, behind the counter. You have to ask for it specifically, as it’s not an on-the-menu option. Why try to keep it secret? A smaller size delivers a better, more classically potent espresso flavor while being healthier and cheaper at the same time. That Venti cappuccino you’re holding is not a cappuccino. Trust me.
Even more surreptitiously, Tim Harford, author of the book The Undercover Economist, says that some companies participate in deliberate “product sabotage” toward products that are less profitable. This includes hiding them, damaging them or making their packaging look ugly, encouraging customers to buy the bigger, better options.
“It’s not hard to identify the price-blind customers in Starbucks. They’re the ones buying enough latté to bathe Cleopatra,” Harford wrote in Slate. “The major costs of staff time, space in the queue, and packaging are similar for any size of drink. So, larger drinks carry a substantially higher markup.”
And so, as is inevitable with any business situation, it all comes down to money. Starbucks has to find a way to keep up with fast-food chains such as McDonald’s, which serve larger drinks for less cash.
And though Starbucks optimistically states that a sweetened Trenta-sized drink won’t be more than 230 calories, it’s still a disconcerting move in a nation where everyone, including me, can’t seem to get a grip on how much they should be eating and drinking. Such curiously manipulative business practices aren’t going to change for a while.
At least now I can have a Trenta iced tea to hold me over until they do.

Kentucky-based Cage the Elephant gained fame last year with a blend of sounds from funk to punk and a penchant for artsy, strange music videos. The band has undergone drastic changes in sound and persona.
But in their second album, Thank You Happy Birthday, the alterations have proven to be for the better.
Good fun · The band’s tracks create a general sense of fun as well as a variety of sounds from aggressive sounds to sincerely honest tracks. -  Photo courtesy of Jive Records 
Thank You Happy Birthday opens with “Always Something,” a droll song that haunts the listener with the simple-but-eerie guitar work of Lincoln Parish and Brad Shultz.
As spooky as the opening song is, the air surrounding “Always Something” is a perfect fit for the cynical and depressing lyrics that set the song in motion, generating an intriguing blueprint for the album.
After “Always Something,” the album offers a lineup of abrasively honest songs. Some reveal the stereotypical shortcomings of pop culture, love and society. Others are more artistic, engendering a quasi-grunge experience.
Cage the Elephant offers sincerity with “Aberdeen,” a nod to Kurt Cobain, as it is the name of his hometown.
Daniel Tichenor’s banal bass line holds the song together, accompanied by disjunctive vocals and spurts of electronic feedback. “Aberdeen” is highlighted by its catchy chorus and artistic quirks, especially the quavering voice of lead singer Matt Shultz.
“Indy Kidz,” serves as one of the band’s more satirical songs, exploiting the clichéd ideal of fitting within society’s scenes.
The song opens with a facetious introduction, and Shultz seems to merely read the lyrics, not even trying to sing.
Still, this lack of musicality strategically adds weight to the song’s emphatic statement.
The lynchpin of Cage the Elephant’s album is “Shake Me Down,” as the single is both a nonpareil song and an embodiment of everything unique to the group.
Shultz’s scorching lyrics ring throughout the song, which segues nicely into another one of Cage the Elephant’s polished hits, “2024.”
The articulate instrumentals of both create a vivid audio-backdrop for the listener.
Cage the Elephant's new album "Thank You Happy Birthday."
The more rambunctious songs on the album, including “Sell Yourself,” present vivid sounds in a different fashion.
The aggression in the lyrics and the dissonance of the instrumentals collaborate to paint a perfect portrait of chaos fueled by the frustration of people not staying true to themselves.
Of the later tracks, “Around My Head” shows the widest breadth of musical artistry by paying homage to the Pixies, incorporating realistic lyrics of frustration that listeners can relate to.
Primitive chants and screams that draw out the character of the song and peculiar similes, such as Shultz’s introspective comparisons to “bread ties” and “homemade elevators,” further compliment the song.
The album abruptly transitions to “Sabertooth Tiger,” slapping the listener in the face with Jared Champion’s beastly drums, the rest of the band’s raucous instrumentals and Shultz’s savage vocals. Guitar effects, unexpected tempo changes and dramatic pauses make “Sabertooth Tiger” an exciting piece of desperation.
Following the animal pattern, “Japanese Buffalo” begins with a melancholy story-like introduction to soothe the listener, but in classic Cage-the-Elephant-like fashion, proceeds to catch the listener off guard.
Another fast-paced song, full of incoherent lyrics and gibberish at some points, along with throat-wrenching, ear-piercing screams, “Japanese Buffalo” builds to a controlled roar.
The album wraps up with “Flow,” an unclenched finale paired with a bonus track: an alternate version of “Right Before My Eyes.”
The latter is a bogged down version of the original with elegiac vocals and placated instrumentals.
“Flow” and the transformed version of “Right Before My Eyes” successfully bring Thank You Happy Birthday to a serene conclusion and end a diverse album that manifests Cage the Elephant’s true selves.
The musicians showcase their identity with a morphed creative process and a fresh sense of musicianship.
Simply put, listeners will find that Thank You Happy Birthday is an insanely fun album.
I totally agree! I really like the new sound they’ve developed. There was a lot of pressure on them with this album, but they definitely pulled it off without a hitch. “Shake Me Down” is my favorite song… and I love the new video they just released for it. Also, they’re just starting a tour like, next week so keep an eye out for them on the road! I know they’re coming through STL on Feb 24th and I couldn’t be more excited. :)
I agree.  I have looked forward to this album release with anticipation of how it may top the first and Cage has proven to release an album that is still truly impressive and will be in my stereo for a long time.
I agree with you, Sean, I find this album to be a great pleasure to hear. It’s much more multifaceted than their fist album and really hits the mark. I think they’ve developed their sound nicely and I’m more than impressed with Thank You Happy Birthday.

The transition to college can be tough. Even after freshman year, leaving the comfort of home is difficult. Making friends and getting involved helps ease the process, but ending the day in a cold, bare and unwelcoming dorm room or apartment hardly compares to the uniquely soothing sense of home sweet home.
Yet dorms and apartments have the potential to be spaces where personality and creativity can let loose. Because these empty canvases are so sparse, your dorm room is a perfect opportunity to experiment and figure out what design style best suits you.
Though decorating might seem silly, especially given the fact that most of us will move around each year, there are many affordable steps you can take to make your apartment or room a home.
Candles and incense are nice, but sometimes fire codes restrict their use. In this case, many of the flameless alternatives have now become stylish. You can find them at Target starting at $10.
Splashes of color are another fairly easy way to liven up and personalize a room. Whether this means buying those extra storage units and drawers in color rather than clear or buying some fun throws or floor pillows, the extra effort truly makes a difference.
Floor pillows are particularly great because they add color and comfort while also increasing the seating capacity of the room, an added luxury for entertaining or just hanging out.
Zebra-print pillows are a simple, affordable way to make your dorm room or apartment more homey. 
One of my roommates brought two zebra print pillows to accent our putrid brown, suspiciously stained couch, and they made all the difference. The living room now looks as though humans live there and care enough to make the space their own, even if only for nine months.
Though posters are certainly a college dorm cliché, picking a theme, at least for the common spaces in an apartment, can help make the most of an inexpensive accessory.
Whether the theme emphasizes landscapes, art replicas, a music genre or old movies, the extra planning will result in a poster display that is cohesive. Visit Amazon.com for the cheapest posters, starting from 99 cents plus shipping.
Dedicating a wall to be collaged throughout the year can also be a fun and virtually free decorating option. All your roommates can contribute to the wall, immediately personalizing the room. You might choose to use old magazines or newspaper clippings. Some friends of mine decided to allocate one wall for pictures that they took throughout the year, allowing them to look back on memorable events. If a picture is worth a thousand words, at the end of the year, your wall will tell quite a story.
Vases can be a great investment in home decorating. 
Should you want to go the extra mile, investing in some vases is always a good idea. The fresh flowers sure to follow will not only make any room more aesthetically pleasing, but will also add a pleasant aroma, useful in masking those familiar, unwanted college scents.
Though you most likely can’t paint your walls, you could make or buy a colorful, quilted bulletin board, which is both functional and aesthetically interesting. One option is to cover basic canvases with several different patterned cloths that match your bedding, so that you can hang those blocks of color on the wall.
You might not be the next “Design Star,” but that doesn’t mean that you can’t make your room or apartment your own. Some people might not care what their space looks like, but for those of us who miss the familiar comforts of home, these tips can help make the disparity less noticeable, all while serving as an outlet to express your creativity and personality.

According to the Institute of International Education, just more than 260,000 U.S. students studied abroad in the 2008-2009 academic year.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
That’s all of North America. We’re at USC, where the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences alone has 52 different study abroad programs in 28 different countries.
These places can range from somewhere as exotic as Costa Rica to a bustling city like Beijing. The Study Abroad office offers destinations in 48 different majors.
Chances are, almost everyone has thought of going overseas.
This consideration could range from reading up on actual programs to watching the movie Eurotrip‚ and thinking Eastern Europe wouldn’t be so bad for a semester.
Either way, it’s an easy notion to entertain.
What doesn’t cross most peoples’ minds is the preparation that studying abroad entails.
More specifically, I’m talking about that awkward window of time when everyone’s back on campus and you’re‚ well, probably at home, packing. Unless you’re one of the few people who plans to study abroad multiple times and has gone before, you’re gearing up for an experience you still don’t understand.
But your program should let you know what you’re getting into, right? To some extent.
Although the glossy brochures help you visualize the experience, you can’t expect the basic details of your trip to be set in stone.
For example, the two central components of my trip are still giant question marks.
My destination is Amsterdam. I know I’ll be taking classes, but I have no idea what they are. I know I’ll be living with a host family, but again, I have no idea who they are.
This is the first time my program has let students pick a non-dorm option, and so far, staffers haven’t seen it necessary to give me my new family’s contact information.
With no friendly e-mails for reassurance, I can only ask: What if they hate me? What should I bring them from the United States? What if I turn up at the airport and they ditch me? Yikes.
The lack of information has taught me the first lesson of studying abroad: No matter how excited you were when you applied, at some point, you’re going to end up terrified.
For many people, that point comes as soon as they land. For others, it’s a month or more into the  experience.
I’ve heard of a honeymoon period when everything about the host country seems sparkly and magical‚ until you get lost in 10-degree weather and can’t read the street signs. In my case, that point is now.
But fear of uncertainty should not stop any student from going abroad.
When you choose to spend a semester in another country, you essentially make yourself grow up a little. That fact might be more obvious for those studying in countries where running water isn’t a given, but even more urban destinations require a maturity boost.
We’re all going to grow one way or another. It’s a privilege to be able to make that growth a conscious choice, one pre-packaged with college credit and a résumé booster.
After all, most growing experiences involve no warning or organized selection. Life slaps you in the face and expects you to deal.

Some students arrived back on campus last week with their entire semester already planned, while others had no idea what the spring might hold in store for them.
For most, the spring semester represents a fresh start. Any tedious classes or unforgiving schedules from the fall are now in the past, and students have the chance to take advantage of new opportunities.
The start of a new semester should be a time to build upon last semester’s successes and learn from its failures. Especially for students in their first year at USC, having a semester of experience under their belts should make the spring even better.
One of the most effective ways to take on the new semester is to try something new. Sign up for a spin class at the Lyon Center, strike up a conversation with a fellow Trojan at the Campus Center, or spend a day in a different part of Los Angeles.
Most importantly, get involved in something.
Extracurricular activities are an important part of the overall experience. They provide an opportunity to meet people who share a common interest.
Join a club sport or get involved with a service organization. No matter what your interests are, there’s probably a student group that would be a great fit, and if there’s not, then you can start one of your own.
But joining a group on campus isn’t the only way to take advantage of the new semester. Start looking for jobs or internships that might interest you and will provide the perfect opportunity to gain experience and exposure to a particular industry.
Challenge yourself to achieve something new in the spring, no matter how big or how small.
The new semester can be much more than just a change in classes. Take advantage of it, and don’t be afraid to embrace spontaneity in your decisions. That one small choice to do something a little differently could end up making your semester even more successful.

Highly-regarded ESPN NFL draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. released his first mock draft of the year Wednesday, projecting USC offensive tackle Tyron Smith to be selected No. 22 overall.
Smith, a junior, announced in December that he would forgoe his senior season to declare for the draft after an impressive 2010 campaign.
“We wish Jurrell and Tyron the best as they move on to a professional career and we thank them for their great contributions to the Trojan football program,” said coach Lane Kiffin in a statement last month regarding Smith’s decision to leave, as well as junior defensive lineman Jurrell Casey. “We realize there are many factors that go into a player’s decision to leave early or stay in school, and we’ll always support the decision that he and his family make.”
Kiper has noted that Smith, who measures in at 6-foot-5 and 280-pounds, could become the “top tackle” before April’s scheduled draft.
Other services project Smith as a first-round pick as well, including ESPN’s Scouts Inc., which ranks him as the 16th-best prospect for the 2011 draft and eighth amongst underclassmen.

They always say it’s good to have friends in high places and for singer songwriter Cary Brothers, it has definitely played in his favor.
Brothers’ college friend, Zach Braff, put his song “Blue Eyes” in his movie Garden State. The critically acclaimed soundtrack then earned them a Grammy and “Blue Eyes” went platinum.

Soon thereafter, Brothers subsequently landed over thirty film and television spots as well as several appearances on notable talk shows. Since the start of his career, Brothers has called Los Angeles home and is very active in the local music community.  He often performs at the infamous Hotel Café, the second home for rising singer songwriters like himself.
His sound can be best described as indie rock with a tinge of pop, with heavy beats, melodic guitar riffs, angst-ridden lyrics,  yet incredibly catchy. To date, he has two full-length studio albums.
His first album “Who You Are,” produced by the label Bluehammock, is often described as a soundtrack to people’s lives, full of highs, lows, emotional distress and little victories.
His second album “Under Control,” released independently last year, is fresh but true to Brothers’ sound. Although still quite heavy, there is a more acoustic and raw sound to the songs.
My Top Picks: “Blue Eyes,” “Loneliest Girl in the World,” “Ride,”  “Alien,” “Ghost Town” and “Something About You.”

Although the Golden Globes came and went last Sunday, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts is just getting started, announcing Monday its nominations for the 2010 film season.
The King’s Speech, which garnered a sole Golden Globe in the Best Actor-Drama category for Colin Firth, leads the BAFTAs with 14 nominations.
Darren Aronfsky’s psychotic-ballerina thriller Black Swan was nominated in 12 categories, with Christopher Nolan’s dream-epic, Inception, close behind with 9 nominations. The surprise box office hit True Grit and British filmmaker Danny Boyle’s 127 Hours each received eight nominations, while award show favorite The Social Network trails in the race, boasting only six nominations.
In addition to the arguably lackluster performance of The Social Network, the BAFTAs — hailed as the most prestigious film awards across the pond — offered a pleasant change-up in the acting categories.
Julianne Moore, seen as a dark horse when in the increasingly golden light of co-star Annette Bening, was nominated alongside Bening in the Leading Actress category for her tender turn in The Kids Are All Right.

Another fresh face in the Leading Actress race is Noomi Rapace, the sleek, enigmatic star of the unexpected Swedish film sensation, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, based on the crime novel by the late Stieg Larsson.
True Grit’s Hailee Steinfeld was bumped up from Supporting to Leading Actress, while Mila “Sweet Lips” Kunis was left out of Supporting Actress contention, being replaced by Black Swan co-star Barbara Hershey for her horrific turn as a perfection-seeking mother.
Critic favorite Lesley Manville also received a Supporting Actress nomination for Another Year, the latest film from acclaimed British writer-director Mike Leigh who, surprisingly, was overlooked by the BAFTAs.
Although heavyweights Jeff Bridges, Jesse Eisenberg, Colin Firth and James Franco were acknowledge in the Leading Actor category, BAFTA also added Javier Bardem to the already impressive shortlist for his performance in Biutiful. Kids co-star Mark Ruffalo—whose portrayal as a scruffy rouge-turned-wannabe-dad has been largely overlooked—makes an appearance in the Supporting Actor category, along with the late Pete Postlethwaite for The Town.
It looks like BAFTA wasn’t too impressed with The Fighter, a major contender that has been going head-to-head with The Social Network since awards season commenced. The true-to-life boxing drama scored only three nominations: Best Original Screenplay, Supporting Actor (Christian Bale) and Supporting Actress (Amy Adams).  Recent Golden Globe winner Melissa Leo was snubbed in the Supporting Actress category.
The 2011 BAFTA Awards will take place Sunday, Feb. 13 in London.

You can usually tell how well (or badly) an event went by the chatter among the attendees in the ladies restroom.
Robert Krieger at the GRAMMY Museum on January 14, 2011. | Courtesy of the GRAMMY Museum
At the GRAMMY Museum Friday night, the mood following the part Q&A, part mini-concert that imploded in the 200-seat Clive Davis Theater was nothing less than exhilarating.
“Was that not the shit?” a woman breathlessly asked, to no one in particular, as she reapplied her lipstick. The exclamation was quickly echoed by a chorus of agreements resounding throughout the stalls.
That “shit?” The seminal, newly Grammy-nominated electric guitarist Robby Krieger.
In one of their first events of the new year, the GRAMMY Foundation hosted Krieger, an unassuming, rather frail-looking man well into his ’60s who Rolling Stone deemed the 91st greatest guitarist of all time. In his twilight years, Krieger has been crafting compelling instrumental albums that interweave jazz and rock, the latest of which, 2010’s Singularity, was nominated for a 2011 Grammy Award in the Best Pop Instrumental Album category. But many—including the 200 fans gathered that night, some dressed in their finest tie-dye and others, leather—remember him best as the lead guitarist for The Doors.
The Doors’ legacy typically lives on through Jim Morrison, the temperamental, tousled hair poet who acted as the band’s charismatic yet somewhat unhinged frontman until his untimely death in 1971.
Undeniably bestowing upon the band a daring sex appeal, Morrison was the fearless media leader, garnering attention and creating fodder fit for modern-day tabloids. When it came to the music, however, Krieger was an essential foundation for the band, defining their wild, jazz-tinged sound with his piercing slide guitar.
“I don’t it’s overstating it to say that our guest tonight and his work with The Doors helped make rock music matter, both here and around the world,” said vice president of the GRAMMY Foundation Scott Goldman at the beginning of the evening. “The music of The Doors was complex, metaphorical, long-form in nature, improvisational — lots of things that not only influenced rock music, but informed Robby’s career after The Doors.”
When Krieger began entertaining the idea of playing guitar, however, rock music was all but under his radar.
“My dad had a great record collection, and he had some flamenco albums. I would listen to them, never thinking I would ever play guitar,” he said. “But some of my friends then started playing when I was 12, and little by little I would borrow their guitars.”
At the age of 16, Krieger finally received a guitar of his own — “a Mexican flamenco guitar,” which his father bought for $180.
“I never thought about playing rock and roll,” Krieger admitted. “Then, I was just playing flamenco and folk.”
Until, that is, he saw Chuck Berry in concert at the Santa Monica Civic Center in 1963, with Big Mama Thornton and The Chamber Brothers as the supporting acts.
“When I saw that [show], I said, ‘I gotta play like that guy,’” Krieger recalled. “I went and traded in my guitar for a red Gibson guitar the next day.”

While in his teens, Krieger was also schooled on jazz, attending John Coltrane and Miles Davis shows whenever those musicians stopped in Los Angeles — experiences that lingered when he became a member of The Doors.
“We really just saw [The Doors] as poetry and jazz,” he mused.
Krieger met Morrison and keyboardist Ray Manzarek through drummer John Densmore while he was studying at UCLA. Morrison was instantly enamored by Krieger’s finger-pick playing — he never used a pick while in The Doors — and his experimentation with the slide technique.
“It was kind of amazing how the four of us, musically, gelled from the very beginning. I’ve been in a million different band situations since then, and it’s never been that feeling, that easy,” Krieger said.
And even though Morrison has always been portrayed as a tyrannical leader of sorts, Krieger describes the writing and recording process as creatively democratic.
“Once I got in the band, Jim said, ‘We don’t have enough originals. Why don’t you try writing some songs?’ So I went home and wrote ‘Light My Fire.’” Kreiger recalled.
Krieger added he was glad the band decided to do the extended version of “Light My Fire,” especially when the radio stations ignored the cut, three-minute version and played the iconoclastic hit in its entirety.
“I don’t sit around listening to those records anymore, but I do like hearing them on the radio,” he laughed.
Following “Light My Fire,” Krieger went on to write a slew of equally as popular Doors hits, including “Love Me Two Times,” “Love Her Madly” and the racy rock fanfare “Touch Me.” He claims his guitar style — renown for his mastering of the slide technique, at once elegant as it is piercing — evolved over time, although he acknowledges that being sonically distinct was always in the back of his mind.
“I always said if your mother can’t tell if that’s you coming over the radio, then you don’t have a sound,” Krieger quipped.
Friday night, Krieger had a chance to show off his slide technique, inviting his band onstage to perform several selections from Singularity, including the Coltrane homage “Runaway Trane” and the flamenco-tinged “Russian Caravan.”
As he looked out over the audience, nodding his head at the standing ovation — perhaps long-overdue with a career like his — he reminded his fans about the upcoming Grammy Awards.
“You never know,” Krieger said breathlessly, smiling. “We might just win.”

In his twilight years, Krieger has been crafting compelling instrumental albums that interweave jazz and rock, the latest of which, 2010’s Singularity, was nominated for a 2011 Grammy Award in the Best Pop Instrumental Album category. But many—including the 200 fans gathered that night, some dressed in their finest tie-dye and others, leather—remember him best as the lead guitarist for The Doors.

 The Doors’ legacy typically lives on through Jim Morrison, the temperamental, tousled hair poet who acted as the band’s charismatic yet somewhat unhinged frontman until his untimely death in 1971.

  Undeniably bestowing upon the band a daring sex appeal, Morrison was the fearless media leader, garnering attention and creating fodder fit for modern-day tabloids. When it came to the music, however, Krieger was an essential foundation for the band, defining their wild, jazz-tinged sound with his piercing slide guitar.

 “I don’t it’s overstating it to say that our guest tonight and his work with The Doors helped make rock music matter, both here and around the world,” said vice president of the GRAMMY Foundation Scott Goldman at the beginning of the evening. “The music of The Doors was complex, metaphorical, long-form in nature, improvisational — lots of things that not only influenced rock music, but informed Robby’s career after The Doors.”

 When Krieger began entertaining the idea of playing guitar, however, rock music was all but under his radar.

 “My dad had a great record collection, and he had some flamenco albums. I would listen to them, never thinking I would ever play guitar,” he said. “But some of my friends then started playing when I was 12, and little by little I would borrow their guitars.”

 At the age of 16, Krieger finally received a guitar of his own — “a Mexican flamenco guitar,” which his father bought for $180.

 “I never thought about playing rock and roll,” Krieger admitted. “Then, I was just playing flamenco and folk.”

 Until, that is, he saw Chuck Berry in concert at the Santa Monica Civic Center in 1963, with Big Mama Thornton and The Chamber Brothers as the supporting acts.

 “When I saw that [show], I said, ‘I gotta play like that guy,’” Krieger recalled. “I went and traded in my guitar for a red Gibson guitar the next day.”

 While in his teens, Krieger was also schooled on jazz, attending John Coltrane and Miles Davis shows whenever those musicians stopped in Los Angeles — experiences that lingered when he became a member of The Doors.

 “We really just saw [The Doors] as poetry and jazz,” he mused.

 Krieger met Morrison and keyboardist Ray Manzarek through drummer John Densmore while he was studying at UCLA. Morrison was instantly enamored by Krieger’s finger-pick playing — he never used a pick while in The Doors — and his experimentation with the slide technique.

 “It was kind of amazing how the four of us, musically, gelled from the very beginning. I’ve been in a million different band situations since then, and it’s never been that feeling, that easy,” Krieger said.

 And even though Morrison has always been portrayed as a tyrannical leader of sorts, Krieger describes the writing and recording process as creatively democratic.

 “Once I got in the band, Jim said, ‘We don’t have enough originals. Why don’t you try writing some songs?’ So I went home and wrote ‘Light My Fire.’” Kreiger recalled.

 Krieger added he was glad the band decided to do the extended version of “Light My Fire,” especially when the radio stations ignored the cut, three-minute version and played the iconoclastic hit in its entirety. 

 “I don’t sit around listening to those records anymore, but I do like hearing them on the radio,” he laughed.

 Following “Light My Fire,” Krieger went on to write a slew of equally as popular Doors hits, including “Love Me Two Times,” “Love Her Madly” and the racy rock fanfare “Touch Me.” He claims his guitar style — renown for his mastering of the slide technique, at once elegant as it is piercing — evolved over time, although he acknowledges that being sonically distinct was always in the back of his mind.

 “I always said if your mother can’t tell if that’s you coming over the radio, then you don’t have a sound,” Krieger quipped.

 Friday night, Krieger had a chance to show off his slide technique, inviting his band onstage to perform several selections from Singularity, including the Coltrane homage “Runaway Trane” and the flamenco-tinged “Russian Caravan.”

 As he looked out over the audience, nodding his head at the standing ovation — perhaps long-overdue with a career like his — he reminded his fans about the upcoming Grammy Awards.

 “You never know,” Krieger said breathlessly, smiling. “We might just win.”

 “It was kind of amazing how the four of us, musically, gelled from the very beginning. I’ve been in a million different band situations since then, and it’s never been that feeling, that easy,” Krieger said.

 And even though Morrison has always been portrayed as a tyrannical leader of sorts, Krieger describes the writing and recording process as creatively democratic.

 “Once I got in the band, Jim said, ‘We don’t have enough originals. Why don’t you try writing some songs?’ So I went home and wrote ‘Light My Fire.’” Kreiger recalled.

 Krieger added he was glad the band decided to do the extended version of “Light My Fire,” especially when the radio stations ignored the cut, three-minute version and played the iconoclastic hit in its entirety. 

 “I don’t sit around listening to those records anymore, but I do like hearing them on the radio,” he laughed.

 Following “Light My Fire,” Krieger went on to write a slew of equally as popular Doors hits, including “Love Me Two Times,” “Love Her Madly” and the racy rock fanfare “Touch Me.” He claims his guitar style — renown for his mastering of the slide technique, at once elegant as it is piercing — evolved over time, although he acknowledges that being sonically distinct was always in the back of his mind.

 “I always said if your mother can’t tell if that’s you coming over the radio, then you don’t have a sound,” Krieger quipped.

 Friday night, Krieger had a chance to show off his slide technique, inviting his band onstage to perform several selections from Singularity, including the Coltrane homage “Runaway Trane” and the flamenco-tinged “Russian Caravan.”

 As he looked out over the audience, nodding his head at the standing ovation — perhaps long-overdue with a career like his — he reminded his fans about the upcoming Grammy Awards.

 “You never know,” Krieger said breathlessly, smiling. “We might just win.” 

 “When I saw that [show], I said, ‘I gotta play like that guy,’” Krieger recalled. “I went and traded in my guitar for a red Gibson guitar the next day.”

 While in his teens, Krieger was also schooled on jazz, attending John Coltrane and Miles Davis shows whenever those musicians stopped in Los Angeles — experiences that lingered when he became a member of The Doors.

Melted wax, used matches and empty glass jars, remnants of hour upon hour of candlelight vigils, cover the concrete in front of the Shell Station at Federal Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard in West Los Angeles — a memorial for Bahar Yaghoubian, a fourth-year graduate pharmacy student who was killed in a car accident earlier this month.
Remember · Friends and family members have started the Bahar Foundation to enforce annual check-ups for senior citizen drivers. - Phoebe Unterman | Daily Trojan 
USC will be holding its own memorial service for Yaghoubian this evening at 7 p.m. in Mayer Auditorium, located in the Keith Administration Building at USC’s Health Sciences Campus for Yaghoubian.
There will be time at the service for students and faculty to share their memories of Yaghoubian, who was struck and killed while driving at the intersection Jan. 9, and to watch a slideshow with pictures of her life.
Several pictures of Yaghoubian are currently on display outside the gas station where she was killed, showcasing her characteristic smile.
And it’s that smile passersby are first stricken by. It’s that smile her friends and family mention first when they speak of Yaghoubian.
And it’s that smile that first enchanted her boyfriend of eight years, Rodney Raanan, the man she planned to marry.
It was part of Yaghoubian’s outlook on life, encompassed in a piece of paper with the saying, “Always be smiling please!” that hung from a shelf in the center of her room.
Her parents, Fariba and Behzad Yaghoubian, and her sister, Shadi, remember the doctors and nurses at Tehran Clinic Hospital being taken aback by that gorgeous smile May 31, 1985, Yaghoubian’s birthday.
Her talent for connecting with people and making everyone around her feel at ease helped her adjust when her family immigrated to the United States from Iran in 1998 and settled in Los Angeles.
Her diligence helped her win medals and honors on the varsity track and cross country teams at Santa Monica High School.
It took her to UCLA, where she graduated in 2007 with a 4.0 GPA, and then on to the USC School of Pharmacy, from where she would have graduated in May with her PharmD degree.
“She deserved graduation more than anyone,” said third-year pharmacy student and friend Emily Delkhah.
Her stellar grades represented more than just her wish to be at the top of her class.
“She wasn’t like an average student who studies to get an A,” said Parisa Sooferi, another close friend of Bahar’s and fellow fourth-year graduate pharmacy student. “If you ask her something from three years ago, she’ll still remember it. She learned everything for her own sake and in order to become a better pharmacist.”
To her friends, she was the one that brought both laughter and wisdom to their lives. Bahar was their role model for such a lifestyle.
“She gave out an energy that made people want to approach her and see who she was,” said Jenik Hakhamzadeh, another friend and fellow fourth-year graduate pharmacy student.
Her friends and family say they have received an overwhelming number of messages from USC students and faculty who had known Bahar, or even those who just remembered seeing her on campus.
Sooferi, Hakhamzadeh, Delkah and some of Bahar’s other close friends organized the memorial at USC for everyone to share their memories of Bahar.
Because it was an 81-year-old woman who lost control of her car and hit Bahar’s, causing the accident, her parents and friends are determined to establish a foundation in Bahar’s name with the goal of prompting the DMV to enforce annual check-ups for senior citizens to ensure that they are physically and mentally capable of driving safely.
For those who are interested in donating to the Bahar Foundation, there will be a place at tonight’s memorial service to leave contact information.
Anyone interested can also e-mail info@BaharFoundation.org. Bahar’s family and friends are looking not only for monetary donors but also for those with ideas for expanding the organization.
Other states haves such programs (senior safely courses at least), and it’s amazing California does not.  However, in my mother’s state (NJ) these are not mandatory.  It’s totally voluntary and when you complete it, you get a certificate that gets sent to your insurance company that lowers your cost a bit.   Like with the younger drivers, insurance goes up after becoming a senior because of the risk factor.    Also, since applying for social security doesn’t even start until age 62, and most people are having to work these days until age 70+,  the suggestion of 60 is ridiculous. Probably made by a 20 year old, not a 40 year old, lol.   However, I hope all the “less government” people out there start reconsidering their mantra.  Mandatory driver safety testing is just one of many government programs that we should have.  I’m very sorry for the family and friends of this vibrant young woman.
I have been mourning the loss of BAHAR even though I never met her.  I attended her memorial at the Nessah and was sadden, PRAYING  to G-D to give strength to her family to toleare the pain of her loss.  Yes, because our brain reacts differely to situations.
I also agree that ALL age 60+ should have a mandatory annual PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL  and NEUROLOLOGICAL  test.  including a mandatory annual driving test after  age 65+.
MITRA
Yes, everybody age 60+ should have a mandatory annual test.
From age 65+ including a mandatory annual driving test.

The Undergraduate Student Government passed a measure  Tuesday that will allocate money to presidential, vice-presidential and senatorial candidates. USG also approved a measure that extends the deadline for students to apply to run.
The senate allocated $2,000 to be split among all presidential and vice presidential campaigns, which have a spending limit of $1,500. The money will be divided according to the number of candidates running. Senatorial candidates, who can spend up to $300, have a total of $1,000 allocated, which will also be divided according to the number of candidates.
Candidates can apply for reimbursement and the deadline to submit applications to run for president, vice president or senator was extended from Jan. 21 to Jan. 28.
“One of the main reasons we are having this funding is because we realize that some candidates don’t run for positions because they don’t have the money to run a campaign, said USG Co-Director of Elections and  Recruitment Juan Orjuela.
Orjuela said candidates will submit a campaign finance plan to USG, and once it is approved, USG will divide the money based on the number of candidates for each position.
Orjuela said they hope to have 24 senators running for the 12 positions and three or four presidential and vice presidential candidates .
All applications, available online, are due in the USG room by 5 p.m. Jan. 28.

Freshman Alex Banayan won more than $30,000 worth of prizes on The Price is Right thanks to “pure luck.”
“It’s totally a funny story,” he said. “On the Monday of finals week two days before my finals, USC Hillel sent out a Facebook message saying they had some tickets for The Price is Right. So I said, ‘What the heck? I’ll go, I’ll get the tickets.’”

In an episode that aired Monday, Banayan won a billiard table, a VIP trip to Six Flags Magic Mountain, a five-day trip to Florida that includes a zero-gravity flight and an 18-foot sailboat — collectively worth $32,288.
Banayan said that when he was called down, he did not even know how to play the game.
“I had to ask people in the audience, ‘How do you play?’ I had to ask Drew Carey during the commercial break how to play the Showcase,” Banayan said. “The audience would laugh at me and yell at me because I was the 18-year-old kid who didn’t know how to play The Price is Right. I was winning each round by pure luck.”
In the One Bid first round, he guessed that a billiard table priced at $1,100 was worth $800. He didn’t win in the pricing game, but was entered in the Showcase Showdown, the final round, with a lucky spin.
“I was way under, but everyone just guessed a little over, so they all got out. So I was the only guy that made it on,” he said. “When I was spinning the wheel [to be in the Showcase round], the girl before me got an 80 and I got an 85.”
Banayan narrowly won the Showcase prize — the Six Flags and Florida trips and the boat — guessing they were collectively valued at $30,000.
The woman he was competing against guessed that her $30,332 package was $28,999: a $1,333 difference. Banayan’s package, however, was worth $31,188, a $1,188 difference, which Carey called “very close.”
“During my finals I was sitting there thinking, ‘Why am I taking a final? I just won a boat.’ My brain was all over the place,” Banayan said. “It totally screwed me up for finals, but it was totally worth it.”
The episode featuring Banayan aired Monday and can be watched on the CBS website.
“After I won, all my friends from USC stormed the stage,” Banayan said. “It was a really fun experience.”
You have a great party boat now.  Use it while you can.  Girls love being on the water if you know what I mean!  You can pack at least 2 or 3 on a 20ft boat.  ohhh memories
Alex.  Congrats on your win.  What are you gonna do with your sail boat?  When are you gonna get a bigger boat?  When will you find time to study when out on the open ocean?
Just remember the true defenition of luck:  When opportunity meets preparedness!!!
I wanna see SC students win college Jeopardy. I watched the one in ’07 filmed at the Galeen Center, but SC, the UCs, and the oh-so “academically prestigious” Ivies got their butts kicked. I just remember the guy from Stanford and the premed girl from UNC Chapel Hill dominated.
Seems like every year, there’s a USC student who wins big on The Price is Right.  I won big last year (video linked in my name), and now Alex.  Congratulations on the big win!
Thanks J.W.– it was a blast! 
I’ll check out your video… is it on youtube?
If you click on my name, it’ll take you to the video.

With the House poised to vote Wednesday on a repeal of President Obama’s landmark health care legislation, the White House is working to emphasize the bill’s benefits to young Americans.
“The Affordable Care Act signed by the President helps Americans across the board, particularly young Americans,” said White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs during a phone conference with student journalists. “It ensures that they get access to affordable health care and get a fair deal on health care.”
It is estimated that one-third of young Americans are currently uninsured, Gibbs said.
Under the Affordable Care Act, young Americans can be insured under their parents’ health care plan until the age of 26. Gibbs said 1.2 million young Americans will gain insurance through the Affordable Care Act.
“The President and others believe that the best way to provide stability for young Americans is to allow them to stay under their parents’ health care plan,” Gibbs said.
The Affordable Care Act also helps those with pre-existing medical conditions obtain health insurance.
“One hundred and twenty-nine million Americans who have pre-existing health conditions under 65 could be denied coverage or pay higher prices if they attempt to pay health insurance on their own,” Gibbs said. “It is now prohibited for individuals under 19 years old to be denied health care, and it will be illegal for anyone [to be denied] in 2014.”
Elizabeth Adabale, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said she approved of the benefits the Affordable Care Act provides for young adults.
“It’s great that under the Obama health care reform, you are able to stay under your parents’ insurance until 26,” she said. “Tackling health care early makes for healthy adults, so the state doesn’t have to pay for people later on.”
Republicans have criticized the bill for destroying jobs in the private sector.
Gibbs contends, however, the health care bill has added approximately 1 million new jobs to the private sector and repealing health care could stifle job growth.
“Without health reform we are likely to lose 250 to 400,000 jobs a year based on the health of our current economy,” Gibbs said.
Some Republicans have deemed the health care bill unconstitutional because it requires all Americans to have health care or pay a penalty.
Regardless, the White House stands behind the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.
“We are confident that the way the law was written and passed by Congress that the legislation will be ruled constitutional,” Gibbs said.
Republicans aim to repeal and then replace the health care bill, but many of them recognize that they do not have enough votes to repeal the bill in the Senate.
“I don’t think there is any doubt that the legislative impact of tomorrow’s [House] vote is symbolic in its gesture,” Gibbs said. “It’s intended to send a signal to [the Republican party’s] base voters.”
Gibbs criticized this gesture and said that it was sending the wrong message to the American people.
“The message it sends to the Americans is that we are going to put health care insurance companies back in charge of making health care decisions, not patients,” Gibbs said.
Casey Penk, a freshman majoring in international relations, disapproved of the Affordable Care Act, but insisted that young people remain at the core of any health care bill.
“[The Affordable Care Act] provides a good safety net for young people, which should be part of any legislation,” Penk said. “But I would say that [the bill] reaches too far beyond that.”
