Californians are constantly worried about possible earthquakes occurring when they least expect it. Recently, this fear has been exacerbated by an earthquake advisory that was announced earlier this month and ended on Oct. 4. While the thought of a natural disaster is daunting, USC is taking steps to ensure that students are safe in such situations.
Daily Trojan file photoShake the ground · Last year’s Great California ShakeOut had actors in makeup portraying people injured in an earthquake around campus.
This Thursday, USC will participate in the Great California ShakeOut, the largest disaster drill in history, with millions of people expected to participate. USC has been involved in this program since 2008 as part of the University’s extensive emergency-preparedness program. The drill is intended to help people feel prepared in case of a major earthquake and practice how to protect themselves in what could potentially be a life-threatening situation. All members of the University, including students, staff and faculty, are highly encouraged to participate, regardless of what part of campus they are on.
Hannah Hunt, a freshman majoring in global studies, commented on the importance of this drill to her as someone who isn’t originally from a place where earthquakes happen regularly.
“I’m from Connecticut, and earthquakes aren’t really an issue there, so I was never taught what to do in that sort of situation,” Hunt said. “I think USC’s drill is a really good idea, that way all students are on the same page and I’ll know how to protect myself if there’s ever a large earthquake while I’m living here.”
In addition to participating in the ShakeOut, the Office of Fire Safety and Emergency Planning recommends that everyone assemble an emergency kit with supplies such as food, water and first aid kits. In addition, it is important to make sure that items such as bookcases, TVs and cabinets are securely placed in homes, as they could collapse and cause damage or harm in the event of an earthquake.
The University prides itself on its continuity — there are multiple plans in place that are exercised annually. The Departmental Business Continuity Plans ensures that every school and department on campus has a plan for conducting their business offline until city services are restored. The IT Disaster Recovery Plans requires that every IT department on campus having a plan for backing up and restoring critical IT functions should the campus lose power, infrastructure or server capacity. Finally, the University’s financial officers are prepared to exercise emergency purchasing powers, payroll and accounting functions if the need ever arises. Once a major emergency has been stabilized, the University has plans in place to ensure everything returns to normal as smoothly as possible.
Steven Goldfarb, a fire safety and planning specialist from the USC Office of Fire Safety, said that the University is very prepared in case a major natural disaster ever hits campus.
“USC has an extensive, award winning all-hazards emergency management program,” Goldfarb said. “All schools and departments participate in planning, training and drills to ensure we can respond to and recover from all types of emergencies including fires, power outages, floods, weather incidents and much more. The University also has extensive business continuity plans to ensure critical services will be available.”

This semester, USC students have the opportunity to attend a variety of events dealing with themes of race and religion in society from the perspective of three major religions — Islam, Christianity and Judaism.
Photo courtesy of USC LibrariesA religious experience · (From left) Amir Hussain, Pim Valkenberg and Reuven Firestone are the three participants in the new program.
The Race, Faith and Violence program, a collaboration between the USC Caruso Catholic Center and the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies, features panels of three scholars-in-residence from different faiths — Amir Hussain, Reuven Firestone, and Pim Valkenberg — having conversations about issues such as race, gender, sexuality and interfaith violence.
The program was born out of an interest to address topics that are often considered taboo, but are at the center of current political discourse. The program is the brainchild of Father Jim Heft, the head of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies. Heft also had the idea to have  scholars-in-residence specifically available for students in order to engage in these difficult conversations during official events, at weekly office hours and scripture readings.
Professor Amir Hussain is one of the three scholars-in-residence this semester. Hussain is a professor of theological studies at Loyola Marymount University and an editor for the Journal of the American Academy of Religion. He’s recently released a book about how American Muslims have become interwoven into American life and culture, titled Muslims and the Making of America. His work has focused on how different faiths can work together and has explored interfaith relationships, which made him one of the first people that Father Heft thought of when creating the program.
“I think the opportunity to connect with people is great,” Hussain said, referring to what attracted him to the Race, Faith, and Violence program.
Hussain emphasized the value of having multiple viewpoints at each of these events, and the successes they’ve had in diversity of speakers as well as the topics they’ve been able to cover. He credits much of this to the resources of the University and the help from the Caruso Center as well as the Institute.
Pim Valkenberg is the second scholar-in-residence. He’s a professor of religion and culture in the School of Theology and Religious Studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., and has authored multiple books. He’s previously worked at the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies through its “Learned Ignorance” series. Valkenberg specializes in partnerships between the Christian and Muslim faiths based on their shared Abrahamic heritage.
Valkenberg agreed with Hussain on the benefits of this program. He said that the greatest advantage is having all day to work together with colleagues and students in small settings and the ability to learn from one another.
However, Valkenberg also pointed out some of the difficulties of the program.
“It’s really hard to advertise it in such a way that students think, ‘Whoa, this is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,’ which I really do think it is, but it’s kind of hard to find a language in letting students know about it,” Valkenberg said.
Rev. Reuven Firestone, also a scholar-in-residence, is a USC professor in the School of Religion and the Middle East Studies Center, as well as the Regenstein professor in medieval Judaism and Islam at Hebrew Union College. He’s also written a number of books, has worked on numerous projects to promote interfaith understanding and worked to bring together different faiths, especially in the Middle East.
To Hussain, this program is especially significant in today’s troubled political times, when people are struggling to see beyond the hateful political rhetoric of our presidential candidates.
“What’s more topical than race, faith and violence in the age of Black Lives Matter, in the age of Islamophobia and the [2016] election? It’s really relevant for students today,” Hussain said.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Professor Amir Hussain’s book was called “Islam and the Building of America.” It is called “Muslims and the Making of America.”
Can’t see how this will work if each one claims to talk to a god and they are the true faith. They can’t even agree to disagree let alone address issues objectively.
Another course about fantasy.  This is what our universities have come to.
Islam and interfaith?  Yeah…right.  Welcome to Wonderland.
In Saudi Arabia Christians are not allowed to carry Bibles in public or to wear crosses.  Jews are not allowed to step foot in many Muslim countries.  The genocide of ALL Buddhists who once thrived in Afghanistan is complete.  The almost complete genocide of tens of millions of Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh is mostly complete.  The wholesale slaughter of the Animist in Sudan – something just done in the last thirty years – is almost completed.
So let’s pretend the Qur’an does not mean it when it calls for victory over all non-Muslims and through whatever means are necessary.  And let’s also pretend we are wise college professors.  Both are equally absurd.
“What’s more topical than race, faith and violence…?”
Neosporin, for one…

History came alive Saturday at Doheny Memorial Library, where L.A. as Subject, an association of archives and collections hosted by USC Libraries, presented the 11th annual Los Angeles Archives Bazaar. Hundreds of people learned and reminisced about Southern California’s regional past as they perused through more than 80 exhibits spanning the floors of the library.
Fah Aramthanapon | Daily TrojanHow bazaar · Hundreds gathered at Doheny Memorial Library Saturday for the 11th annual Los Angeles Archives Bazaar, which showed off collections that detailed the history and iconography of Los Angeles and Southern California. The event was held by L.A. as Subject in association with USC Libraries.
The bazaar formed a “one-stop shop” for learning about Southern California history, according to Tyson Gaskill, the executive director of communications and events for USC Libraries, which allows organizations both big and small an equal opportunity to display their materials to the public.
“We wanted to have some kind of an event that included as many of the L.A. as Subject member organizations as possible and this seemed like a great idea,” Gaskill said. “And as far as we know, it’s actually spawned other similar archive bazaars around the country.”
Oftentimes, the exhibitors are capable of bringing only a small fragment of their extensive collections to the bazaar, encouraging attendees to seek them out at their original sources in museums, archives or personal collections that are largely available to the public.
The bazaar began when L.A. as Subject moved to the USC Libraries in 2000. Since then, USC has taken advantage of this invaluable collection of resources to the benefit of both its students and faculty.
“The Los Angeles, and sort of, regional history is one of our big collection strings here at the libraries, so we’ve sort of historically had lots of research materials that other people just don’t have,” said.
According to Hugh McHarg, associate dean of planning and communications, it’s the rich cultural history of Los Angeles that makes the bazaar an invaluable resource for USC students.
“It’s a unique strength that we have. It’s a unique resource for our faculty and students, for [students] especially,” McHarg said. “Because if you’re studying regional history, or even cinematic history or urban planning or arts and culture here in Los Angeles, there’s resources here that other places just don’t have.”
Besides being an academic resource, McHarg stressed the collection’s value for creative pursuits, such as a three-episode TV series called Lost L.A., which was co-produced by USC Libraries and KCETLink and released in January 2016. The series featured the works of nine directors, including SCA MFA graduates, who produced shorts ranging from documentary to animation based on primary sources from the collection.
“The research side is obviously a huge part of what we do, but we also want to make sure that creative artists understand these materials are here for them too,” McHarg said. “So that’s sort of a way of getting that message out into the world.
While the collection is certainly extraordinarily beneficial to those at USC, its value is also felt in the surrounding community. According to McHarg, many K-12 students came to the event, where for many of them, it’s their first time seeing artifacts related to the history of L.A.
“They’ll find old photographs, or old journals, or magazines or things that they never knew existed, and it’s a way of showing them that there are these artifacts about their communities,” McHarg said. “Sometimes this is the first time they’ve experienced things that somebody actually saved, and it’s meaningful because it’s about where they’re from. That’s something that never gets old.”

Two Door Cinema Club returned to the music scene after four years, with their long-awaited new studio album Gameshow. The band created their own genre — indie-pop with some rock mixed in and heavy electronic influences. Along with several artists such as Passion Pit, Fitz and the Tantrums and others, Two Door Cinema Club has popularized the upbeat indie music they have come to represent.
Fans of Beacon, the band’s previous studio album, will not be disappointed with Gameshow. The album provides new tracks that remain consistent with the ethos that Two Door Cinema Club previously established.
“Bad Decisions,” the second single from Gameshow, provides a happier and generally brighter sound than was seen on Beacon. However, songs like “Invincible” and “Gameshow” are thematically identical to the songs “Handshake” and “Sun” from Beacon.
Photo from ParlophoneBad decisions · After a four-year hiatus, Two Door Cinema Club released its third studio album Gameshow Oct. 14. The 10-track album features singles such as “Gameshow,” “Bad Decisions” and “Are We Ready? (Wreck).”
The band ingeniously combines their pop sound with more electronic sounds than usual in “Surgery.” “Je Viens La Da” showcases lead singer Alex Trimble’s signature falsetto and is the vocal highlight of the album. Gameshow synthesizes different facets of the band’s unique genre.
The album’s lead single and first song, “Are We Ready? (Wreck)” features lyrics such as “Oh, we’ve made a mistake / We’ve lost our minds / We’ve lost our memory.” The band has openly talked about the problems they faced during and following their last tour, putting the band’s future in peril.
“It was physically and mentally draining, and we got that point in early to mid-2013 where we all agreed that it just wasn’t worth it,” Trimble said in an interview with the Guardian. “We didn’t want to be around one another for a very long time.”
Fans were unsure of whether the band would return from an unofficial hiatus that began in 2012. After taking a long break, with certain members overcoming drug addictions, pursuing individual passions and creating identities outside of the band, they reunited to create an album that they felt pushed the boundaries.
“It’s so good to be back together. So far, the shows have been so much fun, and we’re enjoying each other’s company. It’s nice to have a somewhat healthy relationship again,” Trimble said. “This isn’t a contractual obligation, we’re doing it for pleasure.”
With this album, it seems that the worst is over for Two Door Cinema Club. Remaining in the spotlight for more than six years has historically been a challenge for indie-pop artists, but a few such as Passion Pit and Young the Giant have broken this trend.
The band seems to be following in these groups’ footsteps, with the immense excitement fans have expressed in anticipation of its newest album. The band’s world tour will begin in the United States on Nov. 17 and continue to Europe and Latin America.
While the album does not push the boundaries of what the band has previously produced, it reassures fans that Two Door Cinema Club is back and ready to do what they do best. The band’s musicnaturally pushes the boundaries of traditional indie-pop. Setting the stage for bands such as The 1975 and Bastille, Two Door Cinema Club opened the door for a specific niche of upbeat guitar music.
With Gameshow, Two Door Cinema Club once again proves that they don’t need to change their sound to be revolutionary.

The USC School of Cinematic Arts hosted the ninth annual IndieCade independent games festival for the first time in the festival’s history. This event, lauded as the Sundance of video games, was held at USC due to the University’s top-ranked interactive media and games major. USC students were able to attend the festival and observe its events from Oct. 14 to Oct. 16.
Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanGame on · IndieCade brought industry leaders, independent video gamers and students together to celebrate video games. The USC game design program was voted No. 2 in America by the Princeton Review in 2016.
The event brought gaming industry leaders, independent creators of video games, aspiring gaming professionals, developers and passionate players all to the SCA grounds.
This festival is packed with all-day, all-night events that celebrate nationwide independently developed games. It is a unique chance for the public to play, preview, learn about and interact with development teams from over 200 indie games. These games are the most innovative and cutting-edge of the industry from all around the world.
With booths that surrounded all of the SCA buildings, curious non-gaming students peeped their heads and walked around inquisitively. There was even a booth in the main lobby where attendees and bystanders could play a video game with robots for free.
Signature events and highlights included think:indie, GameU, IndieXchange, Night Games, IndieCade Awards, speakers and networking. GameWalk was the center of the festival because it showcased about 40 games selected by the IndieCade committee for their creativity and technological innovation — for example, virtual reality. The Night Games took place during the evening when attendees could play multiple games.
These games are played on a giant screen in front of an audience — a chance for festival goers to showcase their skills. Speakers included Tessa Blake, an award-winning filmmaker; Emmalee Garrido, an award-winning gamer; and Rand Miller, co-founder of Cyan.
The entirety of the festival strived to provide a platform of exposure for independent game developers. As said in its purpose statement, the festival “encourages, publicizes and cultivates innovation and artistry in interactive media, helping to create a public perception of games as rich, diverse, artistic and culturally significant.”
“My favorite part of Indiecade was stumbling upon games happening around me. Not just video games but physical games, some with full narrative,” said Esther Bharier, a senior majoring in interactive entertainment. “It’s an amazing opportunity for students in my major because some of our professors help organize it or submit games, so we have all the tools to submit games to the festival.”
Video games are not to be limited by their stereotype in society. Video games are not just played in basements, and they are no longer developed by just men.
The gaming industry is vastly growing and becoming more diverse, and IndieCade is an example of this transformation.

At a certain point, probably soon, Trojan fans will start to take winning for granted. It will become expected, and if it deviates from the norm, there will be concern.
This is referring to the stunning greatness of redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold. In another excellent performance against the Wildcats, Darnold further solidified his reputation as one of the best quarterbacks in the country. One great game or even two might be attributed to random chance, but Darnold just gets better each and every week, proving he is that special.

Just as Darnold’s excellence has become routine, Trojan football has become quite redundant the last three Saturdays. Behind Darnold, a stifling defense and major contributions from star players, the Trojans are rounding into form quite nicely. Three consecutive weeks of consistently stellar performances is a welcome attribute for any Trojan football team, especially this year.
While the Trojans did play an injured and fatigued Arizona team who hasn’t had a bye week in two seasons, they still thoroughly dismantled the Wildcats. They adjusted their game plan to stymie freshman quarterback Khalil Tate, an impressive athlete who struggled mightily passing the ball Saturday. They didn’t play down to the level of their opponent and scored a crucial victory on the road, their first this year.
All of this counts for something and the Trojan team should be deservedly happy going into their bye week. It is hard to definitively say how good the Trojans really are, but by the way they are playing on both offense and defense, it seems they can compete with anyone. Darnold is a big reason why.
No drive emphasized that more than the Trojan’s second score, when they marched down the field on the back of Darnold. With other Trojan quarterbacks over the past decade, this drive would have been dead on the first third down.
Facing a third and long, Darnold dropped back and was promptly met by a blitzing and unblocked defender. Using his strength and poise, Darnold calmly evaded the Arizona linebacker in the backfield and fought his way to the marker for a first down, taking on three more Wildcats to get those crucial yards.
Later in the drive, he converted another third down with his feet. The offense wasn’t listless at the time, but it definitely wasn’t functioning smoothly and needed a spark. This is the same type of spark it has needed countless times over the last few years and unfortunately hasn’t had.
Darnold is that spark. When the offense isn’t running properly, he still seems to deliver everyone there right on time. He ended the drive with another play aided by his feet, in this instance biding time until sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett was able to get open in the endzone.
If the Trojans don’t convert on that first third down, the defense goes back on the field in sweltering heat and who knows where the game goes. With Darnold, USC has a margin of error on offense they haven’t had in so long. In the past, a missed connection on a deep ball would effectively signal the end of a drive. Now, there is not even a flicker concern because of the immense confidence that Darnold can distribute the ball or make the play to keep the drive alive.
If Darnold has one area he needs to improve on, it is the accuracy on his deep balls. He made an adjustment in the second half and connected with junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster for a touchdown, but the success of that play was mostly due to Smith-Schuster’s physical prowess and ability as a receiver.
With that being said, USC doesn’t need to throw 50-yard bombs to be effective on offense. They are at their best when Darnold is throwing quick hitting strikes to receivers on the sidelines or across the middle, and giving them space to maneuver. Since he poses such a threat as a runner, the wideouts and tight ends are gifted with single coverage and Darnold has the velocity to fit the ball in on time and in the perfect spot.
The drive with just less than three minutes left in the first half and no timeouts was the perfect example of what USC’s offense should look like on every series. College defensive backs simply can’t match up with Smith-Schuster, senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers and others when they get the ball with room to work.
It’s not all Darnold of course. The offensive line opened up massive holes on Saturday, and the defense turned in another stalwart performance. Each week, junior defensive end Uchenna Nwosu and junior cornerback Jonathan Lockett seem to get better and better. Since the disastrous fourth quarter against Utah, defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast has been dialing up the pressure with great effect.
The win against Arizona doesn’t mean USC is a top-10 team quite yet, but it signals improvement and consistency. While sometimes taken for granted, USC teams in the last half decade haven’t really modeled either of those traits week in and week out. Sometimes all it takes is one player to make that change, and so far Darnold is doing that and much more. Even if this becomes the new normal, his greatness should never be taken for granted. Trojan fans are lucky to be watching the start of something truly special.

The women’s soccer team got back on their feet in dominant fashion against Arizona State on Saturday.
Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanShutting it down · Redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme recorded her eighth shutout of the season in Saturday’s 2-0 win over ASU.
After a 1-0 loss to the University of California broke the team’s 10-game winning streak — which remained clean for the whole of September — the Trojans needed a victory to solidify their place atop the Pac-12. With a No. 6 ranking, the team earned that necessary win on the road against the Sun Devils despite a slow start.
The first half was scoreless for both teams, but that wasn’t for lack of effort on the Trojans’ part. USC dominated possession throughout the first half, and the front line pressured the Arizona State defense, leveling five shots and forcing two saves. But the Sun Devils stayed strong and warded off the offense, despite giving USC its first two saves of the game.
But in the second half, that defense finally caved, and yet again it was redshirt senior Katie Johnson who delivered for the Trojans. In the 58th minute, sophomore Leah Pruitt took a run up the right flank and fed a ball directly into the box. Johnson connected to put the Trojans on the board and take the lead in a game they had already been dominating for a full half.
From there, the Trojans’ aggression only increased. After several shots went wide, senior Morgan Andrews connected with redshirt junior Alex Anthony, who fed junior Sydney Johnson to put the ball in the net — only for the play to be called back for offsides.
The frontline kept up the attack, and in the 76th minute senior Savannah Levin took matters into her own hands. Levin took the ball at the midfield and wove between defenders to work her way into the box and slam the ball home into the left corner. The brace put the Trojans up 2-0, and from there it was smooth sailing, giving the Trojans another win.
The win was the eighth shutout of the season for redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme, who notched five saves on the day. And it was a return to form for the team, who have already knocked off top-ranked teams such as North Carolina and Stanford this season. The Trojans now return home to prepare for one of the final weekends of Pac-12 play, facing Washington State and Washington while hoping to gain ground in conference rankings.

As of last school year, USC employs 25,211 workers, making it the largest private-sector employer in all of Los Angeles. An economic powerhouse with a budget of $4.2 billion, USC needs its employees in order to keep up with the 44,000 undergraduate and graduate students. Over the past few years, strikes have forced the question of whether or not USC treats its employees properly. USC certainly helps the Los Angeles economy grow by employing such a large number of locals, but USC also has a responsibility to its employees to provide them with sufficient salaries and benefits. USC needs to provide employee packages that will allow all members of the University’s workforce to not only survive, but also to thrive in Los Angeles. Doing so will support the surrounding community to keep it safe and will help it prosper. Though employees may not have been treated as well as they should have been in the past, USC is certainly making steps in the right direction. However, the University still has a long way to go before it can call itself a model employer.
Allen Pham | Daily Trojan
Of the roughly 25,000 workers employed by USC, many work in the service sector. Hospitality services, including housing security and dining hall staff, as well as custodial workers and other maintenance jobs, provide the foundation on which the school functions. The men and women who work in USC’s service sector are pivotal in providing students and faculty with the essentials they need to function on a daily basis. Because these individuals are so important to the school, they should be treated with respect. In May 2015, after considerable negotiation, USC struck a deal with the USC Hospitality and Auxiliary Services Workers, raising wages from $11 an hour to $11.75. Each worker also received a $400 bonus and a guaranteed 55 cent raise every July. This new agreement also allowed USC employees to access  healthcare for themselves and their families for an out-of-pocket cost of only $50 a month. While it is encouraging to know that USC acted in such a positive way, it must be admitted that these employees had to fight very hard just to get a simple wage increase and basic benefits.
This was not the only time in USC’s recent history when it has become apparent that  employees were not being treated fairly. In February, workers at the USC Keck School of Medicine Hospital planned a strike because of their lackluster wages and benefits. During the strike, contract workers were brought in to ensure proper care for the patients. Keck employees were quoted as saying that they did not want to leave their patients, even for a day, but they felt they had to strike in order to get USC’s attention. Of the 900 workers at the Keck Hospital, one out of every six employees was making under $15 an hour, and they were also not being afforded the tuition assistance benefits that many other University employees enjoyed.
While wages and benefits are necessary, some additional programs have been cut by the University to the detriment of employees. In July, USC decided to cut the public transport subsidy program that allowed many employees to get to work at a lower cost. Los Angeles Metro passes cost $100 a month, and the University formerly provided a subsidy for the roughly 18 percent of 17,000 employees who utilized public transport. In comparison, our cross-town rivals at UCLA offer a 50 percent public transport subsidy for their employees. With wages as low as they are, USC needs to revisit the idea of a public transport subsidy so that their employees can spend their hard earned money on things other than getting to work.
One of the five traits of a Trojan that USC claims to instill in its students is faithfulness — Faithfulness to shared values, to the Trojan family, and to the community. USC should most definitely continue to hire Angelenos and keep the workforce as local as it can in order to give back to the surrounding community, but if we are going to claim to be Trojans, we must be faithful to that community and to the employees by treating them fairly. In terms of employee welfare, USC has recently made steps in the right direction, but there have also been mistakes that need to be corrected. USC needs to recognize the responsibility it has to its students, employees and the community, and the best way to act upon this realization is to ensure that no employee is living below the poverty line or going without healthcare. Trojans must always take care of Trojans, and as valuable members of our community who allow USC to function the way it does, all employees must be treated properly.
“We want lower tuition!”…. “we want higher pay for workers!”…. so which one do you really want, or can you somehow have both in skinny jeans millennial land??
Rather simplistic of you to assume these are mutually exclusive ideas.  All budgets involve trade offs and I am willing to bet that just about anyone could find other trade offs to accomplish both these goals at the cost of something else.   
Just explain where the money comes from – fairy godmothers?

Come Nov. 8, California voters will not only have the opportunity to voice their choice for the president of the United States, but also to influence state legislation. There are 17 measures in total on the ballot in California — each promising something different. Given the barrage of political commentary surrounding the presidential race, these measures regrettably receive far less attention. There are, however, as many special interests in “ballot measure politics” as there are in presidential politics. By Election Day, more than $400 million will have been spent on signature gathering efforts and campaigning.
Despite the large sums spent to both support and oppose ballot measures, few commentators are talking about Proposition 62 and Proposition 66. Proposition 62 — the more controversial of the two — would eliminate the death penalty in California. Proponents of the measure advocate replacing capital punishment with life without parole for first-degree murder. Alternatively, Proposition 66 would expedite the execution process, cutting through the death-row bureaucracy to create a more streamlined petition and appeals process. Essentially, one measure seeks to abolish the death penalty entirely, while the other intends to increase the number of state executions. Though these measures propose different reforms, one particular truth remains the same: How one votes on either measure ultimately indicates one’s support, or lack thereof, for human rights.
Proposition 66 is a response to a dysfunctional system. Since 1978 when California voters reinstated the death penalty, only 13 of 1,039 convicted murderers sentenced to death have been executed. The comparatively small number of executions is, in large part, the product of an appeals process that takes about 25 years. Overall, the system, which has detained an ailing and aging death row, has cost taxpayers about $5 billion in the last 40 years. Supporters voting “yes” on Prop. 66 claim that this measure will cut costs and expedite the process by designating trial courts to review death row convictions, limiting the number of petitions the accused may submit and increasing the pool of lawyers available to take on appeals.
Opponents of Prop. 66 — including Sen. Barbara Boxer — have fought back, claiming that Prop. 66 would increase not only the cost of criminal justice by overloading county courts but also the likelihood that innocent people will be executed. About one in 10 of California death sentences are overturned — a statistic that highlights the risk of speeding up the execution process.
Similarly, supporters of Prop. 62, a measure to abolish the death penalty, point to the monetary cost associated with executions. Abolishing the death penalty and dismantling a costly system would precipitate annual savings of about $150 million. Although the exorbitant burden the death penalty places on taxpayers should be reason enough to end a practice that provides no demonstrable deterring effects or real relief to victims’ families, the principal reason voters should choose to vote “yes” on Prop. 62 is the protection of human rights.
One hundred forty countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. Worldwide, governments are recognizing both the inefficiencies and the implications of supporting such a practice. Execution arguably violates the right to life as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  It also violates the right to be free from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as provided by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Across the globe and in the United States, the death penalty has been shown to be disproportionately applied to racial and ethnic minorities, against the poor and to people with mental illness or intellectual disability. Although historic U.S. Supreme Court decisions, such as Ford v. Wainwright and Atkins v. Virginia, have sought to address these issues, California has a death row population riddled with extreme cases of mental illness. Moreover, the application of the death penalty is often arbitrary. Whether one receives a death sentence has less to do with the severity of the offense and more to do with whether one is represented by a competent lawyer.
Despite all the evidence demonstrating that the death penalty is simply beyond repair, polls show that approximately 49 percent of California voters still support the death penalty. As a campus that values social justice, members of the USC community — particularly students who are California voters — must vocally advocate for the protection of human rights, voting “no” on Prop. 66 and “yes” on Prop. 62.
