Students and faculty gathered at Tommy’s Place on Thursday to reflect upon the life and achievements of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. For most, the event represented not only a celebration, but also a renewed commitment to the ideals for which King advocated. 
The event consisted of performances by members of the USC community, as well as a keynote address by actor and voiceover artist Gerald Rivers. Each performer was asked to reveal what King meant to him or her personally, and many cited progress and hope. 
Omete “M.C.” Anassi, a senior majoring in neuroscience, delivered a spoken word piece centered on the concept of freedom. The piece touched upon issues black communities are facing, such as police brutality, income inequality and a lack of political efficacy.
“I wrote it at this exact time last year,” Anassi said. “Unfortunately, one year later the words still resonate as much, if not more, than they did last year.” 
Rivers, who credits King with being his source of inspiration, grew up in Compton against a backdrop of racial turmoil. He had two experiences that shaped his worldview: his best friend’s murder and his father’s paralysis after a car accident. Following the two incidents, Rivers — who was a serial truant — decided to complete high school and pursue acting. He graduated with honors and later started performing King’s speeches for various organizations like churches and youth groups. 
“When I actually started listening to the words I was saying as Dr. King, they changed my life,” Rivers said. “In the last 30-plus years, there has never been one issue, one event, one occasion where Dr. King’s words were not appropriate. They are timeless.” 
The event came a day before the inauguration of Donald Trump, whose comments have caused concern for minority groups. Ivory Chambeshi, a USC alumna and outreach manager with the University’s Small Business Diversity Office, performed “My Country, ’Tis of Thee.”
“I’ve felt very defeated in the last few months, in terms of the state of our nation,” Chambeshi said. “It seems like there’s been a regression in the country’s direction. This song, for me, is a reminder that we’ve had hard times, but we’ll get through with faith, community and maintaining our moral convictions.”
When asked what King would think of the current political situation, Rivers responded that he would have wanted people to continue striving for rights and freedoms, but under unity and mutual support.
“Dr. King wrote a sermon called ‘A Knock at Midnight,’” Rivers said. “He said — and it sounds like he’s talking about today — people are more worried, more frustrated, more bewildered today than in any other point in history. So what we’ve got to do is remind them of what’s really important and get them to believe in themselves, and believe in something greater, again.”
Cynthia Brass, an administrative assistant for USC Recreational Sports and the organizer of the event, echoed that sentiment.
“We as a people have to stick together,” Brass said. “It doesn’t matter what your nationality or gender [is]. We have no clue what’s in store for us. So all we can do is be strong and be next to each other.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that this event took place in front of Tommy Trojan. The event took place in Tommy’s Place. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

USC Marshall Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab held its first Lunch and Learn talk of 2017 Thursday at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The presentation featured Luz Rivas, the founder of DIY Girls, and was co-sponsored by USC Women in Computing, the Society of Women Engineers and Girls in Tech. 
Rivas spoke about how her interest in technology developed when she was 10 years old and found out that programming could be pursued as a career. She continued to participate in technology-related activities in middle school and high school.
“My teacher told me that this was a career, and that I would be paid for programming computers,” Rivas said. “I had so much fun doing this, and that was the very first time I got interested in computer science and engineering.”
Rivas began her career as a hardware engineer for Motorola and has worked in the STEM industry for 15 years. While volunteering at a community center in Chicago, Rivas realized that kids weren’t exposed to computer science or any engineering-related subjects. That is when she took the decision to transition from her job as an engineer to work in an education field.
“I was a bit nervous about switching careers because I thought I would be an engineer at a big company and move up within the company,” Rivas said. “But then I made a decision and went to graduate school at Harvard and learned a lot about education and spoke to a lot of people about my interests.”
When Rivas decided that she wanted to start her own organization, she started preparing herself by enrolling in a yearlong leadership development program called Leadership L.A.
“I did other things, like volunteer to speak in groups, just to develop skills that I thought I didn’t have to be a leader or a founder of a social enterprise,” Rivas said. “The first thing I did for DIY Girls [was] start a Twitter account and interact with others who were interested in STEM.”
The DIY Girls is a nonprofit organization founded in September 2011 and believes in creative freedom, opportunity, relationships, empowerment and skill-building. Over 1,200 girls in Los Angeles have used the skills taught to them to create their own projects. DIY Girls offers after-school and summer programs that give girls hands-on opportunities with science, technology, engineering, art and math, also called STEAM.
After a year of planning, Rivas started a program for fifth grade girls at her own elementary school in 2012. Her first grant was funded by the Sparkplug foundation, but it was a $10,000 matching grant. She had six months to raise $10,000 and then the foundation would match it.
“First, I was a little disappointed as to how I would get $10,000 in six months,” Rivas said. “It was a challenge, but I started working towards it and connected with a lot of people.”
Rivas started the program with only $205 and no Wi-Fi at the school but still managed to hold the program twice a week for the girls. She brought tools from her apartment and asked friends for anything that they had. As funding started to come in, she started buying tools for her programs.
“I was also fundraising while the program was on and was multi-tasking because I would teach the kids and was working full-time, too,” Rivas said. “I didn’t wait until I had something to start, and I just thought that I have tables and chairs, I have 30 girls that come and a little bit of money to start with. And as I got started, people would come visit and donate more.”
On Oct. 1, 2013, Rivas decided to quit her full-time job and give all her time and attention to DIY Girls. They have grown five times since they started. However, in mid-Oct. of last year, Rivas decided to leave DIY Girls, as she was appointed the commissioner of the Los Angeles Board of Public Works by L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, where she works now.

USC students rallied with other protesters in front of Los Angeles City Hall on the Thursday evening before the inauguration of President Donald Trump. The rally aimed to call attention to sexual assault and stand in solidarity with victims.
After Access Hollywood tapes, in which the President-elect stated that he can “grab [women] by the p-ssy,” leaked in October 2016, victims and allies condemned the Trump’s behavior and worked to empower those who have experienced assault.
“We’re angry, but first and foremost we want to make sure people know that there are others that are going to fight for their rights,” said Ellie McDaniel, a sophomore majoring in NGOs and social change. “Not everyone has these ideals that Trump has. Not everyone thinks ‘locker room banter’ is a joke. We’re here, [and] we’re going to keep fighting through his administration.”
McDaniel works with “Not On My Campus,” an organization that shares sexual assault testimonials as a way to humanize the issue rather than overly politicize it. McDaniel said her organization also makes a distinction between inciting violence to fight violence and using civic engagement and public opinion to communicate concerns to the incoming administration.
Fiona Lawson, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, attended the rally and explained that those who accept Trump’s “political incorrectness” because they believe he will not act on his offensive statements do not understand the power words can have.
“Words that incite violence aren’t just words … they have real meaning, [and] they are creating tangible consequences for people,” Lawson said. “It doesn’t matter if [Trump] believes the stuff he says or not — he is on the largest public platform there is. He is going to have real influence over the way people think.”
Protesters expressed fear that a Trump administration could strip resources for women and survivors of sexual assault. 
Keyanna Celina, a keynote speaker, shared her story of abuse through the foster care system and shed light upon issues of intersectionality, highlighting her struggles as a black woman.
“Black women typically are erased from feminism,” Celina said. “People can be racist and feminist.”
She also emphasized the psychological hurdles marginalized groups could feel as a result of the unequal distribution of power in the fight for equality — and warned against its potential to further oppress these groups.
“Black women are more vulnerable,” Celina said. “We are considered the ‘throw-away people,’ the people it is OK to rape. When you’re preying on someone, you’re not going to go to the person with the feminist movement at their feet, you go for the vulnerable black woman.”

A cold start shooting from the field for USC could not be thawed out by a blazing scoring run in the second half in a 73-66 loss to Arizona on Thursday.
Despite finishing the game on a 32-17 run over the final 10 minutes of regulation and even pulling within a score of No. 14 Arizona with one minute remaining, USC fell prey to the Wildcats. 
The Trojans (16-4, 3-4) dropped their second consecutive home game at the Galen Center and fell to a losing record in conference play at 3-4. 
After shooting just 8-for-31 from the field in the first half, the Trojans finished the game by shooting 14-for-28 in the second half. With just over 11 minutes remaining in regulation, USC trailed Arizona (17-2, 6-0) by as many as 22-points.
A 28-11 scoring run from USC which spanned 10 minutes in the later stages of the second half pulled the Trojans frustratingly close of tying the score with the Wildcats late in regulation. 
A pair of made free throws from redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron pulled the game within one possession, 67-64, with one minute remaining in the fourth quarter. 
On the following possession, Arizona freshman forward Lauri Markkanen — who recorded a game-high 23 points — took the ball up the floor and sunk a 3-point field goal that put the Wildcats ahead 70-64 with 39 seconds remaining in regulation.
“That was a huge shot, the shot clock was running down, we were playing great defense and we had all the momentum,” Enfield said. “It was just a back-breaker. It was a tough way to lose when they knock down a 30-footer at the end of shot clock.” 
The late 3-pointer from Markkanen put an end to the Trojans’ comeback efforts and effectively put the game out of reach for USC. 
“You never want to have to rely on a late last-minute run to win a game,” junior guard Elijah Stewart said. “We’ve just got to get off to a good start (in games) when it comes to certain assignments. Usually when you get that adrenaline towards the end of the game it helps you out.”
USC’s offensive barrage in the second half was a complete contradiction to the struggles which they dealt with offensively in the opening half. 
As a team, the Trojans shot 1-for-10 from beyond the 3-point line in the first half. USC missed its first nine 3-point field goal attempts in the second half, and a 3-pointer from junior guard Elijah Stewart in the final minute of the first half was only the second 3-point make for USC of the game. 
In the second half, USC shot 6-for-11 from beyond the arc as a team. After missing eight of its last nine field goal attempts to conclude the first half, USC found itself trailing by double-digits at halftime with a score of 29-19.
A 27-15 run from Arizona which spanned the opening five minutes of the second half preceded the Trojans’ comeback run late in the game. 
Stewart was the leading scorer for the Trojans, scoring 15 of his 20 points against Arizona in the second half. 
Clutch free-throw shooting from USC preserved and enhanced its comeback effort in the second half Thursday night. 
After recently poor shooting performances from the free throw line in previous losses to Cal and Utah, the Trojans shot 15-of-18 from the stripe against the Wildcats. 
Following the loss, the Trojans will now stay at the Galen Center to take on conference opponent Arizona State on Sunday. USC will seek a much-needed win over the Sun Devils to remain in the race for a strong finish in the Pac-12 standings.  
“We’ve played well most of the season, but yes, there have been times we didn’t. We just need to keep getting better and staying confident,” Enfield said. “I hope our players realize that they can play with anyone on our schedule. They can beat really good teams like we already have this year … our staff has all the confidence in the world in these guys.”

Yesterday was former President Barack Obama’s final day in office and — regardless of where you fall in the political spectrum — a sad day for sports fans across the country. 
Of the few presidencies I’ve lived through, no commander in chief has been as involved and as knowledgeable about the world of sports as Obama. Devout sports fans such as myself can tell almost immediately whether people in power — politicians, CEOs and celebrities — actually care about sports or are just trying to flub their way through a speech they didn’t write to cozy up to famous athletes (like San Francisco mayor Ed Lee calling Stephen Curry “Steve Curry” in 2013 when presenting the Golden State Warriors star a key to the city. That was cringe worthy).
Through his eight years in office, I’ve watched Obama welcome championship teams and sports icons to the White House with casual jokes, references and remarks that make him feel more like a friend talking sports with you in a bar than the President of the United States making a speech. From making fun of Deflategate to calling Michael Jordan “more than just an internet meme,” Obama certainly has the sports jokes down. 
I’ve watched him fill out his bracket before the NCAA Tournament each year, explaining his picks and breaking down teams on ESPN, making more sense than some analysts the network somehow still employs (looking at you, Stephen A. Smith). In an interview with Grantland in 2012, Obama said he watches SportsCenter during his morning workouts, sneaks a peek at a ball game from time to time while reading briefings and even pays for NBA League Pass himself. GQ published an oral history this week describing Obama’s love of pickup basketball. He routinely played during both of his campaigns, including the day of both elections. 
It’s easy to say that all of this is pointless. Sports is unimportant in comparison to running a country. But can’t we all say that about our lives? Just because your team won a big game doesn’t mean you’ll get a promotion at work the next day. In this sense, Obama connected with us common folk who watch sports and use it as an escape from the stress of everyday life.
There’s also something bigger about sports that Obama touched on beautifully on Monday, when he welcomed the World Series champions Chicago Cubs to the East Room for his final White House ceremony.
“It is worth remembering — because sometimes people wonder, ‘Well, why are you spending time on sports? There’s other stuff going on’ — throughout our history, sports has had this power to bring us together, even when the country is divided,” he said. “Sports has changed attitudes and culture in ways that seem subtle but that ultimately made us think differently about ourselves and who we were. It is a game, and it is celebration, but there’s a direct line between Jackie Robinson and me standing here.”
Robinson, of course, broke the color code in professional baseball, paving the way for the diverse world of sports we have now. In fact, black athletes make up the majority of players in both the NBA and NFL today, while minorities compose roughly 40 percent of MLB players. Sports are proof that no matter the political climate in the outside world, everyone on the playing field is one and the same, separated by their talents and abilities rather than race. It’s more than just the players: Anyone can be a sports fan. Go to a sporting event and you’ll see people across all walks of life cheering in unison for their team. 
“When you see this group of folks of different shades and different backgrounds coming from different communities and neighborhoods all across the country and then playing as one team and playing the right way and celebrating each other and being joyous in that, that tells us a little something about what America is and what America can be,” said Obama, describing Cubs players after their World Series victory. 
That is the true value of sports, which are so much more than simple objectives like putting a ball in a basket or running into an end zone. Obama understood that while Robinson was just a baseball player, he made it acceptable for people of color to participate in a league reserved for whites. That paved the way — more than half a century later — for a black man to lead the country, a position previously held solely by white men. 
And in the end, Obama was just as much a Chicago sports fan as he was the commander in chief. He cared about his March Madness brackets as much as the guy working a nine-to-five desk job, snuck in baseball games as much as the college student “multitasking” while studying, watched SportsCenter at the gym just like you or I would and shot hoops with his friends like any other dude. 
Say what you want about his politics or the legacy he leaves behind. But I’ll simply say this, from one sports fan to another: Thanks, Obama, for reminding us of what sports are all about and how they can make a tremendous impact on progress in society.

“Of the few presidencies I’ve lived through, no commander in chief has been as involved and as knowledgeable about the
world of sports as Obama.”
Spoken like someone young.  What is that, three presidents for you?  For those of us a little older, Gerald Ford actually *played* football for Michigan, winning two national championships.
At least Obama som3 knowleege of something, because he was awful as a president. And his golf index is still above 20. That’s bad for someone who has played as many rounds of golf as he has.  Good riddence, Barry.

After capping off the 2016 season with an undefeated record and the program’s fifth national championship, the No. 2 women’s water polo team will look to repeat that success heading into the new season.
Experience will be the name of the game in 2017 for the Trojans, led by head coach Jovan Vavic, who enters his 23rd season at the helm of the USC water polo program. With a combined 14 national championships under his belt, five of which come from the women’s side, Vavic has a number of weapons on hand as USC aims to defend its title.
The Trojans return nearly every player from last year’s national championship squad and all six of its top scorers, led by senior Peter J. Cutino Award winner Stephania Haralabidis. The driver from Athens, Greece, was named the top collegiate water polo player in the nation after she led USC in goals last season with 63. Her performance in the NCAA tournament —  capped off by a five-goal outing in the final which included netting the game-winner against Stanford with six seconds left to play — earned her NCAA Tournament MVP honors. The First Team All-American and 2016 MPSF Player of the Year currently ranks No. 8 all-time in career scoring at USC with 185 goals.
A trio of veterans in seniors Brigitta Games, Ioanna Haralabidis and Avery Peterson also return to USC’s starting lineup. Games was explosive from the two-meter position last season, finishing second on the team with 43 goals and earning First Team All-American honors. Last year, she also joined Stephania as a finalist for the Cutino Award. 
In addition, Stephania’s twin sister Ioanna Haralabidis enters her final season at USC ranked No. 20 all-time in career scoring with 118 goals. She finished third on the team with 35 goals last season and was named Second Team All-American. Finally, senior two-meter Peterson will serve as team captain for the second straight year. The All-American Honorable Mention scored 35 goals as a junior.
The defense will be headlined by a pair of All-American goalies in sophomore Amanda Longan and junior Victória Chamorro. The duo split time between the pipes last season and helped USC keep its unblemished record intact. Longan made an immediate impact as just a true freshman, averaging 10.4 saves and only 4.7 goals-against in 18 games. With 145 total saves and eight games with double-digit saves, Longan’s presence in the cage earned her First Team All-American honors. 
Chamorro, who spent the summer in her hometown of Rio de Janeiro representing Brazil at the 2016 Olympic Games, also brings a wealth of international experience back to Troy. The former All-American Honorable Mention set the record for most saves by a freshman goalie with 207 in 2015 and averaged 6.7 saves in 13 games last season. 
Lastly, while USC carries a roster heavy with upperclassmen, one newcomer expected to see significant minutes in the pool will be Maud Megens, a freshman driver from Rotterdam, the Netherlands who helped to lead her Dutch National Team to a silver medal at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in Kazan, Russia.
With plenty of senior leadership and valuable championship experience, the 2017 Women of Troy will begin their title defense on Friday against No. 7-ranked Michigan in Santa Barbara in the UCSB Invitational. USC has never lost to Michigan (9-0 all-time) and the match against the Wolverines will begin at 2:20 p.m.

For the men’s volleyball team, winning has not been an easy task, as USC fell to 1-2 in conference play after a tough loss to UCSB in five sets on Wednesday. Friday’s game against UCLA will be seemingly more difficult, not only because it will be a rivalry game but also because the Bruins are currently ranked No. 2 with the highest hitting percentage in the league. 
“If how we came in against Long Beach was any sign, I expect us to come in completely engaged and ready to fight, and then it is going to be a good match for us,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said.
Of the members on the team, senior outside hitter Lucas Yoder is at the forefront of that offensive attack. He has maintained above a .300 total attacking percentage and is leading his team in both points and kills. While he has continued playing at this level, there is always the question of whether he can keep it going for the rest of the season. 
“It is going to get tougher and tougher to do it,” Nygaard said. “Once teams scout and make a game plan against him, it just ramps up the pressure of blocks and assignments and decisions. I still think he can hold himself to a high level.”
Yoder will be put to the test against the Bruins, who are also ranked fourth in average blocks per set. UCLA’s rankings and high statistics could be intimidating, but Nygaard’s philosophy has not wavered.
“I said this at the beginning of the year that if you take care of your side of the net, the other side isn’t nearly as important,” Nygaard said. “We have to make sure that our side of the net is operating at a high level. We’ve shown that we are capable of it.”
Even with the Crosstown Cup points on the line, Nygaard uses his experience as a player both on the collegiate and Olympic level to coach his players on losing the crowd and the rivalries and just focus on volleyball.
“Every team deserves the same attention, every team deserves the same respect, every team deserves the exact same amount of effort and preparation and physical preparation,” Nygaard said. “There is no easy team for us to beat. The one constant in the whole thing is that there is a rectangle on the ground and there is a ball and there is a net. Nothing else matters.”

On the day President Donald Trump delivers his inauguration address, we deliver our inaugural spring 2017 editorial board.
From the night after the election until now, we have witnessed an impenetrable incoming administration. We grimaced as Trump assembled incompetent cabinet members who lack the experience and compassion to effectively represent the people. We quivered as the new leader of the free world so brazenly dismissed intelligence briefings and foreign policy decorum. We marveled at the hacking of the candidacy and now the presidency. 
All the while, we took it personally when professional members of the media, stalwarts who we aspire to be, raised questions about the state of our union but were devalued as “fake news.” And at the same time, real fake news — fabricated headlines generated by illegitimate sources for clicks — went unquestioned and often applauded by the highest office in the land.
Thus, it has become increasingly clear that the media is crucial now more than ever. During a time when the President does not feel the need to provide people with transparency, there is a need to challenge, to hold people accountable and be critical.
In the words of former President Barack Obama, as members of the student press corps, we will continue to be skeptics, not sycophants. There’s a lot of work to be done, especially for our University and the surrounding community.
What is immediately transparent is that sexual assault continues to be a pervasive issue, especially on our campus. The statistics are alarming — according to a survey conducted in 2015, 29.7 percent of USC undergraduates have experienced sexual misconduct, a jump from the previous year’s 17.3 percent and the national citation of one in five. Since then, a survey attempting to reach out to the entire student body has yet to be published. We recognize the need to analyze sexual misconduct on our campus on a wider scope to fully understand this epidemic. During this process, we will continue to place the onus on members of the University to increase response rates and create new initiatives.
In a move that has become  typical of private universities nationwide, USC continues to raise tuition by $2,000 each year. At the same time, the University of California has proposed tuition increases for the first time in years. As students — and as journalists — we are deeply concerned by the unchecked and continuous rise in tuition, and we hope to take an active part in challenging this trend. We will continue to ask critical questions, to gather information and to make student voices heard.
Finally, after being sealed for construction for the past three years, the USC Village will open its gates to the outside world by the beginning of next fall. Once a common space for students and the surrounding community alike, the Village must reinstate affordable commercial establishments in order to replace what was previously taken away from families now facing food deserts. We owe it to the surrounding community to embrace them in our Trojan family.
These issues barely scrape the surface of what needs to be done on our campus in order for our University to better support its students. In the nature of the journalism that is our bread and butter, we will continue to chase the truth and hold the University to the highest standard.
The Trump administration’s tone toward journalists will undoubtedly set a precedent for the treatment and consumption of media. Though national norms for news have been stripped, the Daily Trojan Spring 2017 editorial board will help members of this campus decide what kind of university we want to be.
Daily Trojan Spring 2017 Editorial Board
The irony is very thick here.  Difficult to know where to start with so many false assertions and lapses in logic by the authors. If you fail to acknowledge the lies promulgated by the Democrat party operatives in the media then you have no credibility with reasonable people.    That your editors repeat these lies and innuendos (the election was not “hacked” and proposed cabinet members like General Mattis are clearly not incompetent) that means you are unwilling to deal with and to report on reality.  Try a bit harder to actually think rather than repeat partisan talking points.  Remember – half the country is not on your side.  And based on performance so far, that number is growing.
Today is a day for all Trojans, including alumni, to rise above petty politics and celebrate and embrace our next President, Donald J. Trump.  If Trump lowers corporate taxes as he’s promised (and renegotiates trade deals and enforces our immigration laws), I predict the stock market (DJIA) will rise to at least 30,000.  Accordingly my advice to all USC students upon graduation (as well as all Americans) is:  buy, buy, buy!  What a magnificent and hopeful day it is for all Americans — Fight On!

Since Meryl Streep’s speech at the Golden Globes, the right has, in its inimitable fashion, scrambled to rationalize its own ideological branding mechanisms. Streep called conservatives out, plain and simple, for living in a different kind of bubble: the anti-intellectual one. The new security blanket of the far-righters is a safe space of their own, in which Democratic concerns are promulgated by an insidious and removed “liberal elite.” 
And frankly, it’s strange. I don’t remember when it became such a crime to read and retain information; to seek higher education; to base skepticism in fact, instead of farce. The past year elevated conservative distrust of media to a new level: an aggressive rejection of the educated. The term “liberal elite” is a dog whistle meant to excuse and justify the lack of political understanding and higher learning among the President Donald Trump-supporting electorate, so it’s no surprise that the term was their favorite buzzword. 
And for the Republican establishment, it is a wonderful phenomenon. If any respectable source of media, third-party investigative source or member of academia tells them differently, they’ll sing the chant they know so well: All these ridiculous complaints are simply coming from the liberal elites who don’t understand the “real world.”
The very fact that the term “overeducated” is used in any serious capacity is evidence enough for exactly how vigorously alive anti-intellectualism is. What is it, exactly, to be overeducated? Is it that those of us shooting off our AR-15s at backyard squirrels really understand the geopolitical ramifications of Russian interference in our elections more than Washington political scientists? Or is it that former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, senior expert on forgetting federal agencies, is more qualified to head the Department of Energy than Stanford-educated nuclear physicist Ernest Moniz or Nobel-prize winning physicist Steven Chu? Are Chu and Moniz, too, liberal elites? 
The educated liberals from California must not get it — they’ve never seen this many lost steel or manufacturing jobs destroy a town. Liberals in Washington, D.C. are offering you vocational training and would support your former manufacturing town — but you turn them away, because they are not perfect solutions, and the out-of-touch elite must not get it. Your Republican representative has been re-elected thrice on the promise that those jobs will come back. You keep on waiting, believing him, all the while listening to the lies of anti-intellectualism on Fox News. You don’t need an education. You need your gosh darn job. And those ridiculous liberals just won’t make coal come back. It’s the liberals and their big government. It’s the immigrants. Whatever works.
The liberal elite does not exist. Liberal elitism, as a propagandist term, is the myth of a privileged group of Democrat-leaning voters who use their economic prosperity to cushion themselves from understanding real economic concerns, real subjugation and poverty. It makes sense, in a vacuum. 
But where are they? The Democrats who vote do so consistently for a higher minimum wage, for affordable higher education, for subsidized child care, for national healthcare, for expanded workers’ rights, for taxes on the wealthy, for growing and sustaining a strong middle class — they are concerned most prominently, and deeply, for economic solutions that count. They are not trapped in a callous elitism. 
But perhaps the banks on Wall Street were, when the market crashed and millions lost their homes. Maybe the conservative board of Walmart is, as it cuts the hours of its part-time workers to avoid providing health insurance to employees, all the while making billions in profit.
Or maybe Trump’s cabinet is. Maybe Betsy DeVos is the elite they’re talking about — a Secretary of Education who never let her children set foot in a public school and never took out a dime in a loan to pay for higher education.
Yes, there are liberals somewhere in California and New York who thought they, too, had the easy solutions. They do wear scarves, and they do eat kale. But they also struggle to pay off their student loans, they also barista at Starbucks to make rent and they also go to public schools. They are liberals, they vote Democratic and none of them share the lie of the anti-intellectualist propaganda. While far-right whites in the Rust Belt swallow the lie that education is for snowflakes, that same immigrant family believes that education is the key to the American Dream. One of them is right.
The dog whistle of liberal elites was perfectly placed and unfortunately effective. Maybe if voters had read 1984 or Animal Farm, they’d realize the ramifications of a total rejection of education. Or maybe they’d just shout, “Four legs good, two legs better.” At this point, I really don’t know.

From the moment the band walked on the stage, DNCE screamed one word: eccentric. Just a year and a half after their inception, funk-rock band DNCE has taken the music industry by storm. Their debut single, “Cake by the Ocean,” went triple platinum and reached top 10 on the Billboard charts. 
Their other single, “Toothbrush,” broke 50 million views on VEVO, complete with a video appearance by supermodel Ashley Graham. Following the release of their self-titled album, the band embarked on their 2017 North American headline tour “DNCE,” making stops in Los Angeles, Nashville and New York. 
Brooklyn quintet The Skins, an innovative band that prides themselves on their unique, genre-less sound, opened DNCE’s Los Angeles performance on Wednesday at the Belasco Theater.
“If 21st-century revolution had a sound, it would be post-race, post-gender, post-sexual orientation and post-genre. It would be The Skins,” the quintet’s description said on their website. “This diversity informs a dynamic and definitive style that’s undeniably pop, but also encompasses rock, funk, punk, hip-hop and soul.
Lead singer Bay Li, adorned with bright pink hair and a The Clash t-shirt, showed her versatility by changing from vocals fit for a punk-rock band to a sultry and smooth voice that is reminiscent of Sia’s songs. 
The Skins kept the audience intrigued, with each song entirely different from the previous one. From intermittent rap verses to slow ballads to high-energy dance songs, The Skins had an undefinable style. Dynamic, talented and mysterious, The Skins have a bright and unpredictable future ahead of them. 
Following The Skins’ eclectic performance, six figures in white Stormtrooper helmets marched onstage, with the Star Wars theme song playing loudly.  In a shocking red kimono, Cole Whittle followed onstage with a keyboard that was pushed across the stage like a shopping cart. A blue and white flag emblazoned with “DNCE” was flown across the stage. 
From the beginning of the set to the end, the playfulness of all DNCE’s songs was apparent on stage. Each of the four members uniquely embodies the charm of the band: Cole Whittle’s bright red kimono, Joe Jonas’ dramatic dance moves, Jin Joo’s edgy sunglasses and Jack Lawless’ dynamic drumming. 
The band started off with some of their most high energy, head-banging songs, such as “Naked” and “Body Moves.” Throughout the show, they brought out quirky props to match their songs: Air d\Dancers, bras and DNCE bills.  
After carrying their unlimited energy through fan favorites such as “Good Day,” the band traded in their bass for an acoustic guitar and a tambourine to showcase their wide range and talents. Their slower, equally popular hits, “Truthfully” and “Jinx,” had as many voices echoing and hands clapping as their upbeat hits.
For their finale, the band sang a cover of “Wannabe” by the Spice Girls and “Oops I Did It Again” before closing with their triple-platinum  hit, “Cake by the Ocean,” complete with beach balls and smoke machines. 
Throughout the night, DNCE entertained their audience with their spontaneity, quirks and genuine nature. It is rare to find a band that has so effortlessly produced an album that seamlessly carries their irresistibility and charm from their EP to their album to their stage. 
From “Cake by the Ocean” to “Pay My Rent,” the band’s ultimate goal is to have fun with their fans, whether they are at the concert venue or listening to the music at home. DNCE redefined fun music and has kept their fans dancing ever since.

I got boobs when I was nine and my first kiss when I was 16. My body was a woman long before I was.
I had a revolving door of crushes, and not much else, from fifth through tenth grade. My friends were largely in the same boat. While our peers were out smoking in the mountains or drinking at house parties, the six of us would gather head-to-head in sleeping bags, talking about boys. We were quite pretty and by no means awkward. And we weren’t about to remove our glasses and reveal our more adult side. Our intellect was out of sync with our emotions.
On the night I remembered most clearly, I had recently kissed one boy, making me now leagues ahead of this certain group of friends. We started a conversation about who we thought we’d end up dating in the future, when boys would finally start looking our way. 
When it came time to guess about me, my friend Laura’s words shot me right out of the mountains of pillows and blankets and straight into the arms of a boy I — for years — swore out of my life story. “Emma, you’re the kind of girl who’ll date gay guys before they realize they’re gay.”
With that, he was naked and standing over me again, telling me I needed to shower and masturbate because I’d given him blue balls. And I was on the floor, not realizing how badly I was bleeding.
While some friends knew how uncomfortable and inappropriate Laura’s comment was, somehow we all laughed it off as she attempted to backtrack. I timidly brought up that I thought Shawn was bisexual when I first told my girlfriends about the guy who liked me. I told them I didn’t care because I was bored and ready for attention. I wanted to be kissed and could not imagine how pain could ever enter so profoundly into the scenario. 
Years later, Laura would check up on me to talk about his sexuality, well-known on their shared college campus. I didn’t like to think of it. In my mind, he wasn’t a real boyfriend.
Shawn had a typical “theater boy” callousness that stems from toxic arrogance and profound insecurity. We talked in French to help each other work on our fluency, and when he gave me my first kiss, he quoted a play I’d never seen. He was immensely privileged and I was enthralled by his Upper East Side apartment and confidence in his impending admittance to Ivy League colleges. 
But I don’t think I will ever understand why he felt the need to desperately claw for the answers to questions about his identity in the open spaces of my young body.
I started the first feminist club at my high school. But, I was still confused about consent. I understood perfectly well that you could refuse to perform sexual acts on other people, but at a time of burgeoning sexual maturity, no one taught me about receiving pleasure. No one taught me about receiving pain. 
So when Shawn took me home and stripped me down and played Édith Piaf and called me beautiful, I only said “no” to giving oral sex. I knew I didn’t like his rough tongue, his fingernails on my insides or his hands as they gripped mine around his confused erection as he worked to feel something. But for years, I still thought I’d wanted it.
Recently, I decided to ask my therapist about him and what he did. On her couch, I was still equivocating.
“But I said, ‘Yes,’” I said. “But I didn’t do things to him. I stopped him when he tried to make me.”
 Then I remembered sitting on the hotel toilet days later.
“Dr. Davis,” I said, finally beginning to cry. “I couldn’t pee.”
The tears kept falling. To be honest, they haven’t completely stopped.
I know he didn’t break my hymen because when I had sex for the first time — which was a year later and a truly loving experience — I bled. What Shawn did was different: He hurt me. His fingers cut me inside so badly that I bled for a week and couldn’t pee without a severe sting and a terrifying sense of shame.
I looked up again at Dr. Davis and understood. “How could I have wanted that? I didn’t want that.”
I write this because this fall, on a night when I realized what he’d truly done, I cried on my boyfriend’s shoulders over how I’d survived enough. I couldn’t bear the word assault. I’ve already survived enough.
I’m a feminist, and I’m educated. I asked myself how I could have possibly let this happen without realizing it. Those horrible thoughts have passed.
It is only two months after the realization, and I already feel like I can say his name again after avoiding it for five years. My reactions to him hurting me have been flawed, but they’re natural and they pass. I’m still a bit scared but at least I finally understand.
I don’t wish I’d done anything differently at 16; I simply wish he had listened. I can forgive my young self for wanting to be kissed and held, and I work through this trauma so that I can continue to kiss and hold as much as possible from now on.

In a back and forth match, the Trojans fell to the No. 12 ranked UC Santa Barbara Gauchos in five sets on Wednesday. Gauchos junior Jacob Delson led the way with 22 kills and 4 aces in the 25-21, 21-25, 25-18, 19-25, 15-10 victory. The Trojans now stand at 2-4 overall and 1-2 in the MPSF.
For the Trojans, getting another win against a top 25 team would have been a confidence-booster, but they fell just short this time. On the positive side, they once again received solid contributions from several players. Senior Lucas Yoder finished with 17 kills, while freshman Aaron Strange added 14 kills and eight digs. On top of that, senior Andy Benesh had 11 kills (hitting .526) and six blocks and sophomore Matt Douglas had seven digs.
The Trojans could grow a lot from this game. Though the final result wasn’t what they were looking for, they fought hard against one of the nation’s top teams and nearly pulled out a win. It was especially important for them to put up a strong effort following a devastating 3-0 loss to CSUN in the previous match.
It will be key for the Trojans to continue their physical and consistent play as they take on No. 2 UCLA on Friday at 8 p.m.

Signing off 2016 had to be special. Going back to grad school, moving continents away from family — 2016 was a year of life-changing decisions for me, and it was all quite overwhelming. Winter break couldn’t have been more welcome! I took the chance to reconnect with my closest family in this country and enjoy a wintry sojourn on the East Coast. 
I had been well warned about the harshness of the East Coast winter before I landed at Newark. And for the next 10 days, I experienced it firsthand. I got used to the constant weight of the winter layers on me as I navigated through the perpetual cold, like every other New Yorker. 
The first day I walked around New York City, I instantly fell in love with it. There is something indescribably beautiful about the city that can only be felt if you walk the myriad streets. Every corner you turn, there are chances you’ll stumble upon a famous street, a monument, a museum, a towering skyscraper or a well known landmark that has witnessed a history waiting to be shared. It might seem all too familiar, with the landscape in the background in one too many films. But still, the novelty of it arrests you when you become a part of it.
Shruthi Hiriyuru | Daily Trojan
Treated to a 360 degree panoramic view of the NYC Skyline from atop the Freedom tower, I soaked in the enormity of New York’s footprint on the map. Walking over the famous Brooklyn Bridge, vainly trying to shield myself from the chilly breeze from the East river, while the decades old steel-wires stood unfazed, I realized how small we seemed in comparison to what we built ourselves! While debating whether to join the giggling crowd of tourists waiting to get a chance to grab a “little something” of the Wall Street Bull for luck, I reasoned that every custom, no matter how stupid or irrational, adds to the beautiful culture of a place. Strolling along the famous streets of the city bustling with the Christmas crowd, I was lost in awe as every other nook and corner delighted me with its extravagant and pompous display of colors and lights. As I stood in Times Square, taking in the dazzling show of Billboards, bustling with people from all corners of the globe, I understood why people saw it as the crossroads of the world. 
Shruthi Hiriyuru | Daily Trojan
On board the ferry to Liberty Island, I held my breath as the famous Statue of Liberty finally loomed into focus against the magnificent backdrop made by the New York City Skyline. Listening to the captivating stories of millions of immigrants from all over the world, documented at Ellis Island, I wondered about the history of this country that welcomed them all, the people that arrived here and made it their home. Walking across the sprawling Central Park on a rainy morning, trying to desperately hold on to my umbrella, I was distracted by the still, pure serenity of the wilderness. Getting lost amidst the endless array of art collections at The Met, I took to the museum map to point me to the “must-not-miss” sections and returned having contented myself with the works of Monet, Van Gogh and other special exhibits. Trying to make my way through the flood of people to catch my train at the famous Penn Station gave me that quintessential New York feeling that only the locals seem to chase.
And finally, I bid adieu to 2016, at home with cousins and family, watching the ball drop and wondering what new things the upcoming year has in store for me. Now back home in L.A., as the spring semester is ready to unroll, I am happy I took the break to quell the longing of family connection and slake my wanderlust. Another semester of messed-up routines and crazy schedules, but this time, I feel better equipped, ’cause I’ve learned to be a Trojan and to do things the Trojan way – Fight On!

Two members of the women’s lacrosse team, associate head coach Devon Wills and junior Gussie Johns, were chosen as goalies for the U.S. Women’s National Team, which will play in the 2017 Federation of International Lacrosse Women’s World Cup this summer. Head coach Lindsey Munday, who was part of two World Championships and served as captain for the Team USA in 2013, felt proud to have both women chosen to play on the team.
“Devon and Gussie have worked together for more than two years, and this is a testament to their passion, drive and commitment to improve,” Munday said. “I can’t think of two individuals more deserving of this honor, and it is incredibly special to have Devon and Gussie be the two goalies to represent our country in the World Cup.”
Wills has been part of USC’s lacrosse program for four years and has already competed as the goalie for the U.S. World Champion teams in both 2009 and 2013. Wills’ experience on the field in the highest level of matches will not only help the team as they fight for their eighth world championship victory, but will also serve as an example of what hard work and commitment can achieve.
“Devon is one of the best goalies ever to play the game and is a seasoned Team USA veteran,” Munday said. “Even after 13 years on the team, she continues to push herself to improve and is one of the hardest working people I know.”
Yet another hard worker, Johns is the first Trojan to ever be selected for Team USA. Last season, she led USC in ground balls and their number one scoring defense and led the nation in goals against average, which all contributed to her distinction as All-MPSF and IWLCA All-Region last season. Despite all the attention, she said she simply feels thankful to continue to play lacrosse more.
“It is such an honor to be a part of Team USA,” Johns said. “The opportunity to play with and get to know the individuals on this team has been a true privilege. It reminds me of why I love the sport of lacrosse so much and how we are all playing for a much larger purpose.”
While Wills’ coaching unquestionably helped mold Johns into the player that she has become during her time at USC, Johns’ own desire to constantly progress and the effort she has put in are what ultimately earned her this honor.
“Gussie has followed in Devon’s footsteps and words cannot express how proud I am of her,” Munday said. “Since she stepped foot on campus, she has done everything to improve her game every day. She puts in countless hours of extra work, and it is exciting to see that it has all paid off. In addition to her talents on the field, Gussie is an incredible person and embodies what it means to be a Trojan and a member of Team USA.”

If history somehow repeats itself, then spectators at the Galen Center Thursday night for the USC-Arizona matchup could wind up being in the arena much longer than the average two-hour duration of a college basketball game. 
USC and Arizona split their regular season series against one another in the 2016 season. Their first matchup turned out to be an instant classic. In a thriller that saw the Trojans and Wildcats battle through four overtime periods, USC came away with an exhausting 103-101 victory over then-No. 7 ranked Arizona at the Galen Center. When USC traveled to Arizona later that season, the Trojans fell by a score of 86-78. 
Now looking to this season, No. 14 Arizona (16-2) has gotten off to a strong start in conference play, winning its first five Pac-12 matchups by an average victory margin of 15 PPG. The Wildcats are currently tied for first in the Pac-12 standings with No. 11 Oregon with a 5-0 conference record. 
When Arizona enters the Galen Center on Thursday night, it will be a team which has won 10 consecutive games as it takes on the Trojans. The Wildcats’ only two losses on the season came to top-15 ranked opponents in No. 4 Gonzaga and No. 13 Butler.
After stumbling to a 2-3 start in Pac-12 play this season, USC (16-3, 3-3 in conference) picked up a much-needed conference victory over Colorado Jan. 15. Sophomore forward Chimezie Metu scored a career-high 24 points on 11-of-14 shooting Sunday as the Trojans topped the Buffaloes on the road, 71-68. Metu scored 20 of his 24 points against Colorado in the first half of the game. 
In total, Arizona has five players averaging at least 10 PPG entering Thursday’s game against USC, including freshman forward Lauri Markkanen. Averaging a team-high 16.7 PPG, Markkanen has been an offensive spark for the Wildcats in his first season. 
USC’s contest with Arizona on Thursday will be the second occasion in which the Trojans play a top-25 ranked opponent this season. The team lost its only other game against a ranked opponent this season on Dec. 30 when it fell to Oregon on the road, 84-61. 
The Wildcats will contest Trojan scorers with a stingy defense that ranks 12th nationally in points allowed per game (61.6 PPG). The Galen Center has been a solid home for USC thus far, earning the Trojans a 9-1 overall record when playing in their home arena this season.
As a result of losing three of its last five games, USC is now unranked for the first time since Dec. 15. With a 3-3 record through the first six games of conference play, the Trojans currently find themselves in sixth place in the Pac-12 standings. 
A win over the No. 14-ranked Wildcats Thursday could propel USC back into the NCAA top 25 rankings and would help USC’s cause for a high finish in the final Pac-12 standings this season. Meanwhile, a loss to Arizona would put the Trojans at sub-.500 in conference play and drop them to the lower-half of the Pac-12 standings.

After the completion of the fall athletics season, the Capital One Cup standings were released this week, placing USC in the the top 10 for both women’s and men’s sports.
The women’s teams currently rank in second place nationally, riding high off of a national championship win by the soccer team. The victory earned the women 60 points, putting the women second only to the Stanford team’s score of 83. 
The men’s teams, meanwhile, earned a combined 30 points for finishing in the top 10 of both football and water polo. This distinction placed them seventh in the overall standings, tied with Denver, North Dakota State and Oklahoma. First place in the standings, held by both Clemson and Stanford, is a long ways off at 78 points, but the final rankings won’t be released until the end of this semester.
The Capital One Cup has honored the top NCAA Division I men’s and women’s athletic programs since 2010. The winner of the award brings home both the Capital One Cup trophy and $200,000 in scholarship funds for the school’s athletic programs.
The Trojans took home the women’s award last year, and look to repeat again this year as they emerge at the top of the rankings early in the year. Last year’s victory was the first in program history, bolstered by top 10 finishes by eight of the women’s teams. The program won with a total of 96 points, edging out the Stanford women with 90 and the Penn State women with 83.5. The finish was the most highly contested result since the program’s launch.
Last year’s victory was possible due to NCAA championship victories by beach volleyball and women’s water polo. The volleyball and golf teams also tied for fifth in the NCAA, with lacrosse coming in fourth, swimming coming in sixth, track coming in ninth and indoor track coming in 10th. With one national championship already in the bag for the Trojans, the team will look to finish ahead of Stanford again this season.
This is the highest ranking for the USC men’s program since the 2013-14 season, when the Trojans finished sixth overall. Last year’s team finished 32nd overall despite a second place finish by water polo, a third place finish by golf and top 15 finishes from tennis, track and swimming. However, strong finishes by the football and water polo programs have the Trojans back in the top 10 ranking.
The results of this year’s Capital One Cup won’t be announced until the summer, after the completion of all NCAA competition for the year. The winners will honored at the ESPYS, an annual awards show for athletics hosted in July.

After dropping five straight Pac-12 games, the Trojans looked to right the ship in rivalry play against No. 11 UCLA. Unfortunately, player absences and the type of offensive struggles that have plagued the team in recent games came back to haunt them. UCLA ultimately dominated en route to a 74-59 victory. 
“We’ve just got to do a better job of being aggressive and going to the rim,” said head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. “Getting to the basket and getting to the free throw line. Executing our offense and not make so many mistakes on defense.” 
USC got off to a promising, if tenuous start. The team took a 14-13 lead exiting the first quarter, but it was mostly a mirage. Getting dominated in the paint and allowing 10 offensive rebounds, the early Trojan advantage was thanks only to a barrage of three pointers. Senior Courtney Jaco swished three of them in the first frame, and freshman Minyon Moore added another right as time expired. 
However, aside from the deep shot, USC could muster little offense. They scored just two points in the first five minutes of the second quarter. UCLA forward Monique Billings and her squad used USC’s offensive ineptitude to its advantage, outscoring the home team 27-8 in the second. Billings herself had 14 first half points. The junior finished with 28 points. 
Down 40-22 entering the second half, the Women of Troy knew they needed a massive offensive turnaround to fight back into the game. They provided an initial spark, going on a quick 7-0 run that included a Jaco 3-pointer, but soon after the struggle continued. UCLA marched out on another huge run leading by as many as 20 points and entering the fourth with a commanding 62-45 lead.
In the fourth quarter, the Bruins expanded on the damage they had already inflicted. They held the Trojans to another deflating scoring drought of over five minutes, ending any hopes of a miraculous Trojan comeback.
Her team may have stumbled, but Courtney Jaco had a standout game against her crosstown rivals. The sharpshooter from Compton, Calif. went for 27 points on 7-11 three point shooting, both career highs. 
“Once the first two [threes] went in, I got a lot of confidence of off that,” Jaco said. “The game was going so fast that I didn’t even realize anything. I was just trying to do anything to help my team in that situation.”
Many of USC’s recent offensive issues can be attributed to the absence of junior forward Kristen Simon. The team’s leading scorer and rebounder left the team due to personal reasons last week and the Trojans have dropped all three games without her. Lacking someone to fill her role against a tall UCLA team, USC’s inside offense was negligible. The coaching staff has offered no timetable for her return. 
Luckily for the Trojans, they will get a chance to exact revenge this Sunday, as they play UCLA again at Pauley Pavilion. USC should not have too big of an adjustment playing on the road, as the massive UCLA student section present at the Galen Center on Wednesday made it feel like an away game for the Trojans. The section’s loud chants of “This is our house” as the game ended are sure to stick in the minds of Trojan players as they prepare for Sunday. 
“Honestly just proving that it’s not their house, it’s our house,” Minyon Moore in response to the opposing crowd’s bold words. “To prove that we run L.A., we have to come back to the game stronger with better attitudes and just try to get the win.” 
The usual problems surrounding this coaching staff. The two tallest women are complete stiffs. Team
plays out of control most of the time. Attendance was a farce for a big rivalry game. AD Swann needs
to make a change at the end of the season, enough said.

Attendance issues at sporting events aren’t a new topic at USC. The problem was further magnified when the football team got off to a slow start last fall. There were swaths of empty seats in the Coliseum throughout the season, and it hurts my soul to know that one of the smallest crowds in the USC-Notre Dame rivalry’s history witnessed junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson’s breathtaking performance last November in what turned out to be his final home game.
But I’m not here to talk about football: It’s a titanic program, and after last season’s Rose Bowl run, I’m sure the stadium will be stuffed to the gills come September. We have another exciting team, though, that has been growing in national prominence while consistently playing in front of thousands of empty seats.
It’s unfortunate that that sentence could apply to a large number of Trojan programs. I remember when I was the beat writer for the women’s volleyball team in 2015; despite being the No. 1 team in the nation and going undefeated at home until the penultimate game of the season, USC often played in a cavernously empty Galen Center. 
To his credit, head coach Mick Haley would go out of his way after almost every match to thank the crowd for coming out anyway, but he really should’ve been frustrated. Though over 6,000 fans crowded into the arena to watch the team take on UCLA, you rarely even saw a third of that number week-in, week-out. And this was a team that ran away with the No. 1 ranking and won the Pac-12.
Today, we have a 16-3 men’s basketball team playing in that same arena and drawing the third-fewest fans in the conference. USC’s attendance numbers last season — when the Trojans topped the Bruins three times in one year — ranked in front of only Stanford and Washington State in the Pac-12. The Cardinal have a notoriously lukewarm fanbase, while the Cougars haven’t made the NCAA tournament since 2008, when O.J. Mayo walked the USC campus.
As a school and a student body that supposedly takes great pride in its athletic tradition, we have no excuse for not showing up to watch a team that made it into March Madness last year (and almost pulled off a first-round upset against Providence to boot). 
We hate losing to UCLA, but the Bruins crushed us in attendance in the 2015-16 season, averaging around 8,000 fans per game and drawing over 150,000 total. USC’s numbers? Around 4,500 per game and 80,000 total. It’s a bitter pill to swallow: We’re getting blown out by our crosstown rivals by almost double the score, and we have to turn things around.
I’m not talking down at you from my high horse, either, because I am just as guilty as anyone other Trojan of this spectator apathy. I can’t remember the last USC game I attended as a fan and not as part of a Daily Trojan assignment — maybe a football game back in 2015? 
And it’s not even because I’ve been busy covering events: I just haven’t gotten my lazy rear off the couch on an off day. In fact, as much as I lamented the women’s volleyball attendance earlier, I myself didn’t attend most of the team’s matches during that season if I wasn’t assigned to work them.
But there are still many students out there who love their school’s athletic programs, as evidenced by the Trojan Knights and their unbridled enthusiasm at every USC sporting event. 
That rah-rah attitude used to be ubiquitous. Where has the passion gone for the rest of the students in our campus community?
Perhaps it’s USC’s vaunted metamorphosis into a more “academically rigorous” school and its climb up the college rankings that has decreased our overall interest in sports. Or perhaps we have proven ourselves to be just another L.A. fanbase that can’t be bothered to tune in unless we’re watching the biggest team on the biggest stage. 
I hope neither is the case: I hope even if (when?) we become the most prestigious academic institution in the nation, we will pack thousands upon thousands of students and fans into our sporting venues. And I certainly hope we’re not fair weather fans.
There is an opportunity to put my doubts to rest tonight, 6 p.m. in the Galen Center. Men’s basketball takes on No. 14 Arizona, which rolls into Los Angeles undefeated in conference play and with a slightly better overall record than the Trojans (16-2 versus 16-3). 
The Wildcats’ freshman forward Lauri Markkanen is a top NBA prospect and will undoubtedly be a handful for the USC defense; besides, the Trojans have a few pro prospects of their own in sophomore forward Chimezie Metu and freshman guard De’Anthony Melton (and sidelined sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright, who made a thunderous debut for the team last year). 
It should be a fun game, and after a scuffling start to conference play, USC will need a strong night to show they mean business to the rest of the Pac-12. The team could use a raucous crowd behind it to pull out the upset victory.
It’s time to put our money where our mouth is, Trojan fans. Do we really care about USC teams?
I know it’s a Thursday, but hey, next Wednesday’s game against UCLA was confirmed as a sellout weeks ago, and that’s an even more inconvenient date. Plus, the dinnertime tipoff means everyone should get out of the Galen Center with plenty of time left for activities. It’s a marquee matchup — and a key one for the future of this season for the Trojans. There’s no excuse to keep the arena empty for this one.
See you at the game.

Coming off a Rose Bowl win that Trojan fans won’t soon forget, the hype for the 2017 season has already begun. The Pac-12 released the slate of games for next season Wednesday, and the Trojans now know what lies ahead in their mission to the conference championship and potentially the College Football Playoff. Despite losing stars such as junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson and junior wide receiver Juju Smith Schuster, the Trojans return with talent on both sides of the ball. Redshirt sophomore Sam Darnold, an early Heisman Trophy frontrunner, will have a steady stable of weapons to choose from, and the defense returns most of their starters.
This season, USC will be tested by playing 12 games straight without a bye week. The last time the Trojans’ schedule didn’t have a bye was in 1995. Forced to go through the gauntlet without a break, the team’s depth will be tested. Compared to the 2016 slate, 2017 looks to be a more balanced schedule. Though a schedule without a bye week is less than ideal, the Trojans’ schedule at first glance appears manageable. 
Sept. 2 – Western Michigan
Western Michigan and their “Row the Boat” mantra helped them to the Cotton Bowl in an incredible 13-1 season. But now that former head coach PJ Fleck jumped ship, this team has lost a lot of the appeal it once had. However, of all the Group-of-5 teams to play right now, Western Michigan should be a solid opening game for a USC team with a lot of hype entering the season. In comparison with the 2016 opener against powerhouse Alabama, this game should allow the Trojans to play a fairly competitive team, but one that won’t give them too tough of a time.
Sept. 9 – Stanford
The Trojans open conference play at home against a rival. This game will be a good gauge of how well this USC team can perform in a competitive Pac-12 conference. Former star running back Christian McCaffrey is NFL Draft-bound, but freshman running back Bryce Love is more than ready to step up in his place. Unlike last year’s matchup, USC gets this game at the Coliseum, which helps the Trojans out. 
Sept. 16 – Texas
Texas is a program in flux. After Charlie Strong failed at UT, highly coveted coach Tom Herman will look to bring the Longhorns back to relevance in the college football picture. Getting Texas early in the season may be good for USC, as Texas will have to learn Herman’s system on the go. A convincing win here against a non-conference opponent would help USC’s resume with the College Football Playoff Committee. 
Sept. 23 – at Cal 
A familiar face is at the head of Cal’s program this year. Former USC defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox will get his opportunity to upset his former team. This will make for a fun storyline and should be a winnable first road game for the Trojans against a football program that hasn’t had much success in the past decade.
Sept. 29 – at Washington State 
USC lucks out this year and gets Washington State instead of Washington. But a shorter week, redshirt junior quarterback Luke Falk’s return and an unpredictable Mike Leach offense all add up to make this USC’s first road test. This game has “high scoring shootout” written all over it.
Oct. 7 – Oregon State 
The Trojans get the better draw in the state of Oregon. The Beavers went 4-8 last season and missed out on a bowl game. USC should enter this game confident which means that a slip-up would be costly. With two tough games on the horizon, USC can’t get caught looking past the Beavers.
Oct. 14 – Utah 
Under head coach Kyle Wittingham, Utah has turned itself into a consistent threat in the Pac-12 South. After last year’s disappointing loss, USC will be relieved that this game is at home instead of a difficult road stadium. This could be one of USC’s bigger matchups, but that will depend on how the Pac-12 South shakes out the first several weeks.
Oct. 21 – at Notre Dame 
Notre Dame suffered a down season in 2016, missing out on a bowl game and finishing with a underwhelming record of 4-8. Even though the program appears to be reeling, the Fighting Irish have nothing to lose. A hungry rival on the road will always make for a big challenge for USC.
Oct. 28 – at Arizona State 
Decimated by injuries last year, ASU looks to bounce back from its 5-7 performance in 2016. Redshirt junior quarterback Manny Wilkins is set to return for his final season, but Arizona State doesn’t look to be much of a threat on paper. 
Nov. 4 – Arizona 
Like its in-state rival, Arizona had a disappointing season in 2016. Though teams can’t go to sleep on head coach Rich Rodriguez, the Trojans’ recipe of getting up early and coasting to victory will come into play against both Arizona and Arizona State. 
Nov. 11 – at Colorado 
A road game against the defending Pac-12 South Champion will have huge implications in the Pac-12 South. In USC’s toughest road game of the year, head coach Clay Helton will lead his team into Folsom Field against the AP Coach of the Year Mike MacIntyre and his Buffaloes. This game could be the Trojans’ biggest matchup of the regular season.
Nov. 18 – UCLA
Next year will save the Trojans’ biggest rival, the UCLA Bruins, for last. In addition to being the Trojans’ biggest rivalry game, this game will be the first time we see redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold and freshman Josh Rosen matched up against each other, setting the stage for Heisman Trophy voters to judge Darnold. If both quarterbacks are healthy, this game could come down to the last possession.
A look ahead
Though the 12-week marathon of the regular season will be brutal, USC lucked out when it comes to the balance of its schedule. The fact that USC opens with three games at home, including Stanford and Texas, could be a great way to build momentum, something the Trojans lacked at the beginning of the 2016 season. While it won’t be easy, USC is in a good position to make the preseason hype a postseason reality.
