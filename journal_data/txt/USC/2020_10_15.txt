Throughout many newsrooms, on both a national and local level, the importance of diversity has become a paramount concern for journalism since it is still a majority-white field. The Daily Trojan is, unfortunately, not an exception to this pattern. 
In the internal staff report, which was published two weeks ago and posted on the website, there was a visually apparent gender identity, sexuality, economic and race gap. Thirty-one percent of staffers are white; the smallest represented percentages were Middle Eastern, North African and Latinx members; few staff members identify as Native or Indigenous, per the report. Similarly, the staff is mostly straight at 73%, and there are no members who are non-cisgender identifying. The Daily Trojan is also made up of primarily high-income students. 
The report acknowledged that the staff demographics were not meeting the Daily Trojan’s own standards of intersectionality. In this way, accountability is integral because it allows for an open dialogue of why diversity is so valuable and why it ought to be a top priority for newsrooms. Most people who are closed-minded or ignorant to the importance of diversity see diversifying the newsroom as another case of affirmative action — this could not be further from the truth. Some newsrooms had to learn firsthand how having a majority-white newsroom may lead to tough situations and negatively impact both the staff and community when covering communities that are not majority white. 
For one blatant example, after the death of Kobe Bryant, the BBC aired footage of his life, but it was not Bryant’s photo on the screen; it was LeBron James’. Although the mistake was recognized, the damage had already been done. A staff that lacks diversity and representation can easily make mistakes like this, where two Black basketball players are mistaken to be the same person. It is also the case that a lack of representation within the newsroom produces gaps in what the staff reports on since there are no reporters who understand the lived experiences and perspectives of (or even think to report on) certain communities. 
This has been the case at the Los Angeles Times, where a predominantly white newsroom failed to cover the many different non-white and low-income regions and communities in the city. Coverage of Black, Indigenous and people of color is also usually generalized and confined to crime reporting rather than celebrating events and people within said communities. 
These cases all amount to a larger problem caused by a lack of diversity in the newsroom: white journalists have defined objective truth. In an op-ed in The New York Times, journalist Wesley Lowery explained how objectivity in reporting was decided by white reporters and is tendered to white readers: “Objective journalism is constructed atop a pyramid of subjective decision making of which stories to cover, how to cover them and which sources to seek out.” 
The Daily Trojan, lacking decisively in the representation of non-white, non-cis gendered and low-income students, runs the risk every day of committing these mistakes in reporting on USC’s communities. Recognizing the staff’s lack of representation is the first step and, in the future, the demographics report will be useful for future recruitment. All things considered, though, this does not absolve the Daily Trojan of its lack of diversity this semester. The staff must be cognizant of how unintentional generalizations and clings to white-defined objectivity in reporting may cause harm to staff members and members of underrepresented communities right now — this must be at the forefront of reporters’ minds for the rest of this semester. 
In the future, the Daily Trojan staff will hopefully honor its commitment to diversify the newsroom and recruit more students of different backgrounds in order to have rich and accurate reporting of each community at USC.

USC Visions and Voices hosted the second event of its new series, Foresight is 2020: Racial Justice and the Arts. On Oct. 12, also Indigenous People’s Day, William Warrener, a lead producer part of Arts in Action within USC’s Visions and Voices community, invited three recent graduates and a current USC student to talk about how they use their respective art forms to advance racial justice. 
The first guest invited was Brianna Mims, a movement artist and abolitionist. She graduated from USC’s Kaufman School of Dance in 2019. Since then, a lot of her work has dealt with abolition issues and making sure that society is aligned culturally and politically regarding current world events.
In her seminal installation, #jailbeddrop, Mims expresses these ideas through the lens of prison abolition. The two-part performance and structural piece were displayed in the California African American Museum. Mims said the project started with Justice L.A. in 2017 when she was a part of their creative action team, and a lot of it expanded from her senior project. 
The work includes two structures: a dome and a room. The former, in the context of the performance, Mims said, “becomes emblematic of the prison industrial complex and the ways in which it’s interconnected with just about everything in the United States.” The latter is a 6-by-8 three-walled building, which is meant to represent the same dimensions of a prison cell. Mims said that this structure in the performance is meant to be a “sacred space” because it includes items from people impacted by the prison industrial system. 
After the movement and spoken word performances by Mims and Bindu Swami Nathan, the installation becomes interactive. Visitors of the museum can enter the room and read from a book of people who have been impacted by the prison industrial complex and system. 
Overall, the installation is meant to explore what Mims said are “ideas of accountability, of care, of safety, of human touch.” 
The second guest invited was Mato, an alumnus from the School of Cinematic Arts. Through his music, Mato explores his nuanced identity as an enrolled member of the Oglala Lakota. The majority of this tribe lives on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, and Mato himself was born and raised in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. 
“Falling in love with music helped me fall in love with my culture,” Mato said. 
In fall of 2019, Mato released his album “Scatterbrain.” The project was inspired by his research on boarding schools that native youth are sent to. 
“Growing up I was always horrible in school,” Mato said. And the whole album is “depicting that insecurity mixed with a lot of the historical significance of boarding schools.” 
At the event, Warrener played Mato’s music video for “Hooky,” a song from the album “Scatterbrain.” When asked how he balances music and film (in terms of music videos) with his work, Mato said that “whenever [he is] making a new song or writing something or producing anything, visuals come to mind automatically.” Hence, with the music video, he knew he wanted the visuals to match the chaotic energy heard in the song. 
While at USC, Mato constantly was switching between his involvement on campus and connecting with his family and spending time on the reservation. For him, bridging the gap has been a lot about using art as a form of connection. 
“So I just see the similarities [between Indigenous and other races as] so embedded in the way that you grow up in this country,” Mato said. “For me, it’s been the art that has been able to try to communicate the bridging of gaps.”
The third guest was Jakevis Thompson, a choreographer and dancer. He recently graduated from Kaufman in 2020 and has been working closely with choreographer Frank Gatson. 
A lot of Thompson’s work has been released within the past few months, during the Black Lives Matter protests. When asked about how he remained intentional about his work, Thompson said, “I think just trying to channel that anger and frustration that I was feeling and to use that to light a fire on my butt to create more work to show how we can always overcome this but also at the same time juxtaposing that and showing what is actually happening.” 
Thompson’s choreographed dance for the song “Black Parade” by Beyoncé shows the complexity of emotions from joy to rage felt by Black Americans during this time. 
“I feel like perspective is a really big problem that we have when trying to get people to understand what’s happening, how you can help, why it’s wrong,” Thompson said. “It’s all based on perspective.” 
Hence, the music video for the dance was important because it brought together 40 different dancers who all shared this same perspective, which created this vibrant energy that can be felt through the screen. 
The last guest invited was Anushka Joshi, a senior majoring in communication. She is the co-founder and editor-in-chief of GEN-ZiNE, a publication dedicated to addressing contemporary issues through the eyes of Generation Z. 
“For me when I was in high school, I felt this itching need to redesign a publication,” Joshi said. “Or some form of mass media that we all touch and we all see everyday and have it regard social change.” 
Hence, when she had the opportunity in a class at USC to create a piece of media, she founded GEN-ZiNE.
The magazine is not only a publication but a community for Gen Z to communicate about issues that are important to them. Joshi says the magazine has evolved into a place “where normal Gen Z-ers [and] people who don’t consider themselves writers … [or] activists can come and educate one another to either tell their story or to just to speak on an issue that affects them in their day-to-day life, or a problem that they see in the world.” 
The whole event was an inspiring hour that showed the power our youth holds in advancing the conversation about racial justice in our society today. Albeit in the pandemic, all the guest artists have shown how they could still work on their art and have it mean something in a greater social context.

Vinyl is crackling under the quaint melody of a piano. Suddenly, a heavy guitar riff takes over as a stern voice says, “Look, If you had one shot or one opportunity / To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment / Would you capture it, or just let it slip?” 
This iconic intro coming from Marshall Mathers, known as Eminem or Slim Shady, precedes his song “Lose Yourself” in which he raps about the intense pressure that comes before a performance. This sense of pressure is born out of the need to perform at the absolute highest level, out of fear of failure and subsequent rejection, a common theme among both rappers and athletes alike.
“Lose Yourself” may be the shining example of a song to fire you up for a game. When you find yourself looking to enter a competitive mindset, hip-hop and rap may be a familiar way to get you there, but that may be because it has been competitive from its origins decades ago. 
From the era of Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash of the early 1980s, competition among artists has always been embraced, especially among the elements of MCing (rapping) and B-boying (dancing). Hip-hop artists saw head-to-head competition as a useful way to express themselves through their art form, which was often reflected in their lyrics.
This tradition of competitiveness still lives today in contemporary lyrics. Lil Baby’s “Sum 2 Prove” includes the lyrics “I was sittin’ in jail, they ain’t look out for me / Ones who need me, the same ones that doubted me / I been handlin’ my own, they can vouch for me / Head way down with me, know that she proud of me / Turn the heat up, ain’t nobody hot as me.”
Lil Baby infuses his raps with many of the same themes athletes sympathise with. Within these verses, concepts of hard work, failure and success, dedication and pride all come across as motivating factors for the rapper. Whether it be before practice, weights or a game, these are the same themes that athletes resonate with in their respective careers.
Since 2017, hip-hop and R&B have risen to become the most popular genre in the United States, according to a Nielsen Music Report. I have seen rap as the preferred sound to my pregame ritual in any sport since I began to play basketball years ago. Now rap and sports have become intertwined to a point where both draw inspiration from one another in many instances. Whether it be artists referencing the names of athletes in their songs or athletes endorsing the work of their favorite artists, both have shown an appreciation for the other. 
The feelings of hard work and creating opportunities for oneself transcend sports just as much as they do hip-hop. These feelings conveyed through music have been used to express the struggle of the Black community in the United States. These themes are most notably seen in the work of artists like Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, etc.
They can also be seen more subtly in the songwriting of artists like Gunna as he says in “DO BETTER,” “All black, they can’t see me in the Ghost / Make it back, all I ever needed was hope … I got to be the son, I got to be the one / Nah, I can’t be the one they callin’ a joke (nah).”
Although the song has a smooth melody and a steady beat, Gunna’s synthesized voice delivers a message of Black success through the image of a Black man in a Rolls-Royce Ghost. Much like Lil Baby and artists of similar standing, Gunna touches on the need for hope to increase their sense of belonging and respect within the music industry. 
Just as messages of hard work can be translated to athletes, they can be directly heard as inspiration by people of color in the United States. Although athletes sympathize with the verses of rappers explaining how the deck of cards may be stacked against them, this is the reality for many people of color in the United States. Hearing stories of Black success and overcoming racial barriers in music enables young people of color to have multiple role models to draw inspiration from.
Hip-hop and rap may be a relatively new genre but its artists have come to unite much of the United States through not only sound but also the messages in songwriting. Not all lyrics focus on struggle, but with the hopeful message of hard work that many artists express, it can be seen as the perfect tone for the United States in this time. 
As I seek focus and adrenaline before a match in my “A different animal and the same beast” Spotify playlist, not only am I listening to songs with a beat per minute count that will get my heart pumping, but songs with lyrics that will center my thoughts on success. Not only can rap provide an athlete the drive they need to succeed, but also the drive that many need to create opportunities to succeed. In that way, rap is truly a great American genre.

Hollywood agent and proud USC dad Richard Weitz and his daughter, Demi Weitz, have been raising funds for coronavirus frontline workers for the past six months by hosting private, invite-only virtual concerts over Zoom. 
With performances and attendance by Hollywood’s biggest musicians, talents and film A-listers, this house-party style fundraising event has raised over $12 million from donors across the globe. Coldplay, Billie Eilish, Seal, John Legend, Katy Perry, Sam Smith, Charlie Puth, H.E.R., Ashanti and the cast of “Hamilton” are just a few of the 250 artists that have performed at the events.  
On Sunday, Oct. 11, Weitz’s project RWQuarantunes partnered with Academy Award-winning producer and USC School of Cinematic Arts alumna Stacey Sher and her daughter Maggie Brown, co-founder of the youth-led nonprofit organization The Pad Project, to raise funds to provide menstrual hygiene products for people unable to access it during this pandemic. 
The Pad Project is best known for producing the documentary “Period. End of Sentence,” which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) in 2019. With the saying of the evening, “Periods don’t stop for pandemics,” the event brought together over 300 strong women and allies of women to celebrate the International Day of the Girl Child with the aim to raise $300,000 for the cause. 
Friends and family of the invitees danced and sang along in their little Zoom grids, as British singer-songwriter Natasha Bedingfield sang her iconic song “Pocketful of Sunshine” while dedicating it to the essential tampons we carry in our pockets. 
Jack Black sang Aretha Franklin’s “Respect” in acapella while emphasizing the importance of uplifting women’s lives. Tony Award winner Lena Hall gave us all goosebumps as she sang her cover of James Brown’s “It’s a Man’s World.” Mike Garson played his unreleased piano piece, “Lullaby,” that he wrote for his daughters, sending tears down our eyes. Songwriter Madison Love beautifully sang the hits she wrote for Ava Max, “Kings and Queens” and Selena Gomez, “Rare,” which left us wondering why she didn’t sing them herself originally. 
The hosts surprised us all with musician Kathy Valentine and The Go-Go’s — the first all-female band — as they recreated their hit song from the ’80s “We Got The Beat”— lifting us all to our feet. The musical spectacle of an evening ended with the awe-inspiring Academy and Grammy award winner Jennifer Hudson leaving us all speechless with her rendition of Whitney Houston’s “Greatest Love of All” as she addressed the children of the future and potential they hold.  
The Weitzs posted links in the Zoom chat box for viewers to donate if they were enjoying the performances and believed in the cause. The space was buzzing with praise for the artists, song dedications to loved ones and so much respect for the organizations involved. 
We saw special appearances from famous attendees like actress Zoey Deutch and Poorna Jagannathan, Grammy Award winner Jimmy Jam, R&B singer Macy Gray and special messages from Emmy Award-winning actresses Sarah Paulson and Uzo Aduba. They spoke about the importance of ending period poverty and the need to empower the girl child while raising awareness for their own charitable organizations and charitable work. 
Melissa Berton, the executive producer of “Period. End of Sentence,” Sorelle Cohen, director of development for The Pad Project and USC Price School of Public Policy alum and other members continued to showcase the revolutionary work they had done globally and provided resources for how we may get involved and contribute to helping these causes ourselves. The cause saw live donations from notable author Sam Harris and president of FX productions, Eric Shrier. The final donation from Emmy-nominated producer Joe Davola helped hit the evening’s fundraising goal. 
There’s something genuinely beautiful about the Quarantunes format. It’s truly making the best of such an unprecedented time. What started as a little birthday surprise for his daughter evolved into a powerful initiative that helped raise essential funds for charities working for vital causes such as cancer research, AIDS and hunger. But also, it reinvented the platform and experience that artists and viewers had lost with the pandemic. 
While we stress the importance of social distancing, we tend to forget its impact on our mental health. While we may distance from one another physically, we must come closer emotionally. And what better way to do so than through the unifying power of music. 
It goes without saying that our laptop screens will never replace concert halls and that chat boxes will never match the exhilarating experience of screaming on top of our lungs in the pure joy of being immersed in music. But with the little that we have now, RWQuarantunes has managed to create little virtual rooms of happiness. You can’t help but feel absolutely elated by the effort and the dedication of everyone involved in spreading as much love and laughter in this time. 
The event and its attendees had one goal, and that was to have fun and help with as much as they can. There’s something so disarming about looking at people wave their hands and dance awkwardly in their kitchens and bedrooms — when performances from such revered artists are interrupted by their barking dogs or innocent children. We’re brought into the homes of each and everyone and with that, we bring them into our hearts…unified by the experience of a magical evening and the desire to be better people.

If there was one takeaway from the vice presidential debate last week (besides the fly that took up residence on Vice President Mike Pence’s head), it was that neither presidential candidate’s platform denounced fracking. 
For some context, fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a method of recovering gas and oil from shale rock. After drilling down into the earth, a high-pressured mixture of water, chemicals and sand is then injected into the rock, cracking it to release the natural gas and crude oil reserves inside.
Fracking puts a heavy strain on freshwater resources and contaminates the water used beyond repair, depositing it deep in the earth after use so it doesn’t contaminate the freshwater cycle. An unsteady underground rock formation that has been drilled into can compromise the stability of underground water resources and aquifers, putting the drinking water supply of entire regions at risk. Additionally, contaminated water or fracking fluid leaks can percolate back into the water table and into drinking water supplies. 
Despite the widespread environmental degradation caused by fracking, more than 1.7 million United States wells have been created using the fracking process, which have produced more than seven billion barrels of oil and 600 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. While it has undeniably allowed the United States to be more self-sufficient in its energy usage and created many jobs, the harvesting of a nonrenewable resource is creating lasting environmental effects and it’s essential to consider greater investment in more sustainable forms of energy that could replace fracking in the long term.
Enter the Green New Deal. While the term has floated around for the past few decades, the most recent legislation was proposed by Congressional Democrats in 2019. The proposal has lofty goals, including expanding renewable energy production in the United States to meet 100% of the country’s power demand, starting by weaning the country off of its reliance on fossil fuel industries. 
Among other things, the proposal also lays out plans to develop a “smart grid” — that is, improving the nation’s existing electrical grids with better technologies  — establishing more efficient agricultural practices to reduce emissions, working toward zero-emission transportation and developing low-tech solutions like carbon sinks.
Although Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris has been a noted proponent of the Green New Deal, even co-sponsoring the resolution, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s official platform notably states that he “believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face,” deftly sidestepping the question of whether or not he supports the legislation. Moreover, his plan, titled the “Clean Energy Revolution,” makes no mention of his position on fracking whatsoever. Harris reaffirmed this during the debate, noting that “Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact.”
While Trump has repeatedly attacked Biden by arguing that his stance against fracking will destroy millions of jobs, this isn’t necessarily true. There is no plan set in place to eradicate the United States of fossil fuels and Biden hasn’t proposed a fracking ban, although he has said that he will not allow new projects on public lands. Conversely, the Biden campaign recognizes the essential role that the fracking industry plays in the current American economy and that there is no cleaner energy alternative that is equipped to take on the energy burden that powers and employs people across the country.
Biden’s environmental plan — distinctly separate from the Green New Deal and advertised to be much cheaper to implement — notes that “our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected,” pledging that he will take steps with the goal of achieving a 100% clean-energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050. 
By furthering investment in smart infrastructure, renewable energy and climate innovations, Biden and Harris assert that they will reintegrate climate into America’s foreign policy by rejoining the Paris Agreement and supporting other nations in their fight to mitigate climate change. They also plan to develop solutions for communities that have been disproportionately affected by pollution and emissions. As for fracking? Biden has previously referred to it as a “transition” — should Biden’s rigorous environmental policies and renewable energy investments work effectively, he’ll put America on the road to a future in which fracking isn’t needed. 
While Biden’s environmental plan is vague at times, emphasizing broad goals and ideas instead of concrete plans to achieve them, it should not be lost on voters that the platform understands the importance of aggressively addressing human-induced factors contributing to climate change. Comparatively, the Trump administration has rolled back many of the environmental protections put in place during Obama’s tenure, including revoking California’s authority to set more restrictive state standards on car emissions. 
Trump has opened more public land for gas and oil drilling, relaxed pollution regulations on coal-burning power plants and repealed wildlife protections. While many of his rollbacks were done in the name of preserving American jobs and maintaining energy autonomy, the investments are short-term at best. At some point, the natural gas reserves will run out and American infrastructure and industry will collapse. While fracking may not be ceased as immediately as some would hope, it’s key to start planning for the future while relying on a tried-and-true (albeit problematic) method of energy production in the meantime. 
Biden is no radical figure poised to single-handedly reverse climate change and electing him is no guaranteed environmental improvement. However, he understands that sustainable change is best enacted over time, as he balances the demands of both the nation’s economy and environmental issues. His rational, science-backed approach to the environmental challenges faced in the United States is a crucial step in seeing improvement over the next four years. 
There are many pressing issues at stake in the upcoming presidential election. Thankfully, I’m only here to write about environmental issues, so I’m analyzing just one part of it. So educate yourself and your friends, and if you’re able to, vote.

We’ve all been there: You’re in the mood for an uplifting, energetic strain, hopeful that the sativa (a misnomer since cannabis classifications are actually fake, but you already knew that from one of my previous columns right?) you picked out will get the job done for your night out. But 20 minutes and a joint later, you’ve realized the error of your ways — nothing, and I mean nothing, is enticing you quite like the couch cushions. 
As ubiquitous as the munchies or anxiety attacks, cannabis-induced drowsiness is almost a guarantee. From specially tailored edibles touted to help combat insomnia to curated guides on the best strains for sleeping, a fair amount of the cannabis industry markets itself around the reality of weed fatigue. What’s lesser known is the science behind the tiredness, in addition to what happens during sleep when cannabis is involved.
Cannabis, particularly its psychoactive compound THC, has the profound effect of minimizing stress and tension, reducing pain and bringing about physical relaxation, thus decreasing sleep latency and increasing the depth of sleep. Additionally, given its common usage in providing relief for people with chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder or depression among other conditions that tend to interfere with sleep patterns, weed as a sleep aid makes sense. 
Cognitively speaking, cannabis also greatly impacts the thought process, slowing down one’s ability to digest complex information, impairing focus and increasing the prevalence of distracting, trailing thoughts. Ever been asked by a sleep meditation guide to clear your mind? Weed literally does it for you.
At the same time, cannabis’ biphasic effects indicate that high quantities of the substance can actually trigger restlessness, particularly if anxiety and racing thoughts are the sources of a person’s sleeplessness. In this instance, THC-dominant strains may actually worsen sleep patterns despite their sedative qualities, meaning that people with anxiety could benefit from high-CBD strains, which predominantly treat stress and counteract THC’s negative side effects, namely anxiety. 
Furthermore, high quantities of THC consumption were shown to produce more sleep disturbances, including lower total sleep times, worse sleep efficiency and longer sleep onset, according to a 2008 study published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. However, researchers conducting the study indicated they could not reach conclusive causation and had a small sample size, although their findings were biologically plausible.
Aside from the THC versus CBD dichotomy, using cannabis as a sleep aid requires consideration of many other factors. For example, the entourage effect, a yet unproven but plausible theory, suggests that myriad cannabis compounds — cannabinoids and terpenes — work together to produce a unique blend of effects dependent on their concentrations and the number of each in a given strain. Furthermore, natural sleep remedies, such as chamomile and lavender, can boost the substance’s effects, likely due to their shared terpenes, which are aromatic compounds found in the essential oils of various plants.
Additionally, edibles usually produce more intense and longer highs, as opposed to inhalants, due to the way they’re metabolized, meaning they could aid in prolonging and inducing sleep.
OK, now that we’ve established the link between weed and sleep, let’s follow Sharkboy’s advice in his iconic impromptu song in “The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl” and dive into the dream landscape. 
Dreams occur in the fourth stage of the sleep cycle, during rapid eye movement, which makes up to two hours of our sleep routine. A couple of studies have indicated that THC reduces time spent in REM, meaning that while under the influence, people will have less frequent or vivid dreams.
While CBD remains a more unexplored area of research relating to sleep, a 2014 study published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics suggests the compound can improve REM sleep behavior disorders. A 2017 University of Pennsylvania review also proposes CBD dosage affects dreaming, with high doses increasing REM onset and lower ones decreasing it. While yet to be proven, anecdotal evidence shows that CBD consumers may experience more lucid, positive and enhanced dreams.
Although the jury is still out regarding the exact explanation for dreaming, research has established a link between REM sleep and emotional healing, the creative process, problem-solving skills and memory retention. REM sleep is also the only time during which noradrenaline, an anxiety-inducing neurotransmitter, is significantly reduced in the brain. As a result, dreaming is a fundamental aspect of the cognitive process and its deprivation can cause mood swings and skill impairments, particularly in developing brains. At the same time, there’s no clear consensus on the long-term implication of REM reduction, with some research indicating a lack of any effect.
So, given all the potential benefits of REM sleep, is cannabis’ effect on dreaming a bad thing? Not necessarily. As previously mentioned, cannabis as a sleep aid is particularly effective for people with PTSD and anxiety, whose conditions may include frequent nightmares that cause sleep disruption. In these instances, cannabis’ dream inhibiting properties can actually be helpful.
But something interesting happens with REM sleep once people discontinue cannabis consumption. Known as “REM rebound,” the phenomenon essentially makes up for the hours of dreaming lost to a mellow high. Rebounds are characterized by more frequent, lucid and vivid dreams. A 2019 study indicated that cannabis users reported “higher bizarreness” in their dreams following discontinued use, although researchers drew attention to the study’s small sample size. In accordance with this heightened absurdity, as well as the fact that suppressed REM sleep decreases the prevalence of nightmares, REM rebound can be frightening and disturbing, as people experience denser REM sleep, greater onset and elongated cycle times.
But for Dr. Timothy Roehrs, a sleep expert at the Henry Ford Health System, the link between REM sleep and cannabis is inconclusive, if not completely incorrect. According to The Cut, Roehrs conducted a study (as of yet unpublished) composed of larger sample sizes and placebo weed that seemed to indicate cannabis consumers had decreased sleep efficiency and depth on placebo nights as compared to the control group and when they smoked weed. As a result of missing out on restorative, deep sleep, cannabis consumers may be more prone to awakening on placebo nights during light sleep, meaning that they may be more likely to remember dreams, particularly wild ones, in the morning.
So, I’ve thrown a bunch of incredibly convoluted, fascinating information at you — what now? In reality, there’s no clear-cut answer to solving the mystery of cannabis and its complex interaction with our sleep cycles, dreams and, more broadly, our minds. As always, more specific, well-conducted studies are required to draw further conclusions — something not currently possible with cannabis classified as a Schedule I substance.
And while we don’t know the extent of weed’s effects on sleep, cannabis hangovers (waking up a little cloudy and disoriented for your 9 a.m., you know the feeling) are definitely real, so if using cannabis as a sleep remedy, make sure to pace yourself, listen to your body and dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream.

DivestSC, a student-led campaign that pressured USC to disclose its $277 million investment in the fossil fuel industry last January, relaunched Monday in a letter urging the Board of Trustees’ Investment Committee to publicly divest from the fossil fuel industry and reinvest in renewable energy. 
The Environmental Student Assembly and USC Environmental Core, led by then student organization representatives Nathaniel Hyman and Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, wrote a letter to President Carol Folt in December, calling on the University to disclose its endowment investments in the fossil fuel industry. At the time, DivestSC was an alliance between students from various organizations, supported by the Undergraduate Student Government and Graduate Student Government. Now, DivestSC operates as a distinct committee, led by co-chairs Hyman and Shaw-Wakeman. 
Having achieved transparency about the endowment through their first letter, rallies and calls to the Investment Office, the committee looks to continue to urge the University to divest and reinvest.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Hyman said the campaign was put on pause due to the coronavirus, as pressuring the University to divest during the market crash would have damaged the endowment. However, now that the markets have stabilized, he said that it is time for the campaign to relaunch and for the University to be proactive in addressing the climate emergency.  
“We do have to have a certain level of urgency because, obviously, the time to do this was 10 years ago,” Hyman said. “It’s just important to avoid any sense of complacency and to recognize that … this is the bare minimum of responsibility.”
The present moment is also one colored by the pandemic and a nationwide reckoning with systemic racism, DivestSC wrote. The letter also stated that USC’s public statements on fighting racial injustice and combating the coronavirus are connected to climate responsibility, fitting divestment into ongoing University efforts. 
“It’s not just that sustainability and racial justice and the finances of our endowment live in silos, but that they’re all related,” Shaw-Wakeman said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “When we push one forward we can push the others forward.”
Shaw-Wakeman and Hyman said, unlike divestment movements at other schools such as Harvard and Yale universities, DivestSC also includes more of a financial argument. The letter states that divesting from fossil fuels is financially responsible and would protect the endowment, citing how the market crash from to the coronavirus pandemic caused the University’s endowment to sink along with fossil fuel prices. 
“We’re more based in the financial argument, wherein it’s not just climate change, although that should be a sufficient reason, but there’s also a very strong financial argument to say, these other issues aside, it is part of your fiduciary responsibility to divest from fossil fuels because it is good for your endowments,” Hyman said. “So that’s been a very big focus of our effort and it’s why we’ve done a lot of work to try to make sure our financial research operation is pretty strong.”
The letter also stated that if USC divests from fossil fuel, other institutions will follow and would thus “free hundreds of billions of dollars for investment in alternative sources of energy.” According to the letter, the large-scale change that USC could lead would contribute to the fight against racism, future pandemics and the climate emergency. 
“If USC is the only institution that does this, that’s not extraordinarily meaningful,” Hyman said. “There needs to be a public indication so that there’s a compounding effect on this with other endowments. One thing that we’re trying to do is also put out research, put out resources, so that other students, other schools, can have similar efforts … For this to be meaningful, it needs to be picked up by a lot of people.”
Before DivestSC paused their efforts, Folt and the Board of Trustees’ Investment Committee invited the group for initial talks on divestment and reinvestment. This was the first time students were invited to discuss the endowment with these stakeholders, according to DivestSC. 
“Because of the way that we went about the meetings … coming in very humbly and saying, ‘You are all financial professionals. We are not. We recognize that,’ that went a long way in just opening the lines of communication not just between DivestSC and the Investment Committee, but between students and the investment committee,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “It does work when students have a say in the things that happen, it does work when students get to have meetings with individuals on the Board of Trustees and maybe that’s something that can continue on in the future.”
Hyman said that they are optimistic that they will be able to have another meeting with the Board in the near future. 
USC did not respond to the Daily Trojan’s request for comment in time for publication.
