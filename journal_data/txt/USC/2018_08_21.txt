At face value, this month’s headlines seemed disturbing: the University of Southern California had referred a donation made to the School of Social Work by Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas to federal officials for investigation. USC said it turned the matter over to the investigators because the school forwarded the donation to the United Ways of California, which would later be used for a black voter research project run by his son and former state Assembly member Sebastian Ridley-Thomas.
The article, which was initially published by the Los Angeles Times,  was consumed with innuendoes and veiled accusations. However, the factual element of the article was correct when it articulated that Mark Ridley-Thomas is working to engage one of the County’s premier universities to bring academic rigor and methodology to the issues around African American voting. For many Californians, it is no surprise that the L.A. politician would be actively involved in efforts to bring attention and resources to the cause of black voting rights. 
Throughout his career, Ridley-Thomas has shown singular dedication to reversing the systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans, who make up a plurality of his constituents. He has championed this cause during his nearly three decades representing South Los Angeles in the City Council, in the state legislature and now on the county’s Board of Supervisors. Undoubtedly, his extraordinary public service and his dedication to community progress have made him the most powerful black elected official in the state.
Along the way, he also founded the African American Voter Registration, Education and Participation Project, a political action committee that has registered more black voters than any other organization in the state under his leadership. AAVREP raises hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals, unions and private businesses to run workshops and voter registration drives. It is particularly focused on the upcoming midterm and 2020 elections.
Undisputed data show it is the black vote — particularly that of black women — that fuels progressive elections. The black vote put Barack Obama in office and the black vote will determine the election results of Donald Trump, whose racist leanings are well documented. AAVREP is a vital organization for the black community. Political observers can readily conclude there is a powerful effort to disrupt AAVREP’s progress and its critical mission.
Around the country, state legislatures controlled by conservatives have gerrymandered districts to not only minimize the progressive vote, but also to specifically undermine the black vote. Ridley-Thomas has relentlessly shaken academic lethargy in the areas of public policy and social issues affecting the black community. Scholars and visionaries recognize that without the involvement of the academic community, the experience of black voters remains, at best, anecdotal — and seriously undervalued. Sebastian Ridley-Thomas’ new initiative, the Policy Research & Practice Initiative, exists to correct this oversight by collecting hard data about black needs and voting patterns.
He has made it no secret that this research will form the bedrock of serious academic treatment, informed public policy and the efficient deployment of social services. It is understandable and reasonable that Ridley-Thomas would turn to the former School of Social Work dean Marilyn Flynn, with whom he has worked successfully on a number of projects, to encourage USC’s interest and foster a collaboration to produce that hard data.
Last month, I attended the 109th National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Annual Convention in San Antonio, Tex. The delegates left the convention committed to register, educate and turn out voters across this nation. Thus, we are embarking on our national campaign, “Turn Out 2018 Civic Engagement Movement.” Our national campaign is synonymous to AAVREP’s local goals. Moreover, PRPI is a relevant component to enhance our current 2018 movement and to advance the cause of the NAACP.
Unfortunately, this controversy over USC’s handling of Mark Ridley-Thomas’ donation will detract from the larger good. Consequently, if we fail to produce verifiable research into the lives and experiences of black Californians, we will all be poorer for it. I trust that Sebastian Ridley-Thomas will move forward with the PRPI initiative with or without USC. I encourage him to use every tool within his power to increase and document the political participation of African Americans. The NAACP’s mission compels us to pursue this civil rights issue with Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas.

With the first week of the semester upon us, it’s crucial that the USC community heeds warnings from a study that revealed a decisive spike in campus sexual assaults during the first weeks of school. The study, published in 2017, found that among surveyed students at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, the numbers of reported sexual assaults in September and October marked a glaring outlier: There were between 42 and 54 reported cases, compared with 30 or fewer in other months. 
Earlier this month, UIUC released a series of commendable recommendations on how to address the systemic issue of campus sexual assaults in the earliest period of the academic year. The recommendations specifically identify groups with higher risk of experiencing assault — the LGBTQ community, students with disabilities and students within the Greek system — and outline how to proactively support these groups. But the recommendations also call for the University to double down on addressing alcohol abuse in connection with sexual assault. The issue is that while alcohol education is important for preventing sexual assault on campus, it is not the sole solution.
UIUC appears to suggest  that alcohol — rather than solely abusive perpetrators — is to blame for systemic sexual violence. While education and common sense regulations are key to protecting students from overdose, alcoholism and other dangerous situations, emphasizing alcohol’s relationship with campus sexual assault can serve as an insidious form of victim-blaming. 
The school implies that alcohol has a causal relationship with sexual abuse, which places the onus on students to not drink in order to be safe from sexual violence. But, students’ physical safety is a right. It should not be contingent on any particular behavior or effort on their part. 
Young women, particularly, are all too familiar with warnings of what they should or shouldn’t do, how they should or shouldn’t dress and when they should and shouldn’t go out to avoid abuse. They should learn self-defense, carry a rape whistle, mace and pepper spray at all times, never walk anywhere alone at night and watch how much they drink — lest they find themselves a victim of sexual violence, and risk be accused of “asking for it.”
Sexual assault also is not a phenomenon limited to wild, drunken parties — not when 59 percent of assaults are committed by someone the survivor knew and had a prior relationship with, according to research from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. 
There are many reasons that an estimated 90 percent of campus sexual assaults go unreported, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. But shame and fear of blame among survivors certainly contribute to this reality. The suggestion —  benign and well-meaning as it may be — that reducing alcohol consumption would prevent assault may only build upon survivors’ concerns by seeming to reinforce the idea that they could have protected themselves had they not consumed alcohol.
Dialogues about the best approaches to sexual assault prevention often conjure the image of a famous, mono-color pie chart often distributed by feminist campaigns. The pie chart includes all of the causes of sexual assault; its key lists items such as attire, going out alone, alcohol consumption and, finally, rapists and/or abusers, but only one of these items is visible on the chart: the last one. 
Everyone — students, friends and bystanders — has a moral obligation to do what they can to prevent sexual assault from taking place. Often times, this means intervening when an intoxicated individual is about to engage in a potentially dangerous situation, or limiting the number of drinks a friend has. But we can never allow ourselves to lose sight of the reality that sexual assault is caused by one thing: the active decision of the perpetrator to violate and take advantage of a victim. 
Offering cautionary measures to women on how to avoid abuse approaches the issue from the wrong angle. If we truly seek to prevent sexual assault, rather than shame and disproportionately police young women, we should educate men about consent and how to prevent “blurry” situations. In her landmark 2017 book, “Blurred Lines: Rethinking Sex, Power, and Consent on Campus, “Vanessa Grigoriadis reports that in just about every case of campus sexual assault that she examined, both parties agreed that an encounter had taken place. But the dispute was over whether it had been consensual. 
No campus is immune to systemic sexual violence, especially during the first weeks of school when new students are at their most vulnerable. It’s crucial that all students know they are supported through any circumstance, and no mistake or behavior on their part could possibly justify acts of sexual violence against them.

The issue of gentrification has become a silent boogeyman among liberals. Very few established Democrats have officially endorsed or condemned it, but many of the party’s supporters have voiced their disgust with the economic phenomena. Many local governments have even gone so far as to intentionally withhold investment in their communities to avoid the alleged adverse effects of gentrification.
California’s collective aversion to gentrification has become tragically oversimplified, and is locking generations into financial insecurity. Currently, the state needs 1.8 to 3.5 million new housing units by 2025 to meet existing demand and projected population growth, but it is producing housing at far too slow a rate. If the state continues to develop at a steady pace, it will only produce 80 percent of what the California Department of Housing and Community Development projects as the minimum annual production to meet demand. The housing crisis is costing California $140 billion a year, stalling the state’s impressive economic progress and creating a homelessness epidemic of nearly war-like proportions. 
State Sen. Scott Wiener introduced an ambitious bill last spring to combat the shortage: Senate Bill 827, a resolution which aimed to modernize the damaging sprawl of much of urban California as well as produce more housing. The bill incentivized high-density development by effectively prioritizing the construction of multi-family housing over single-family housing near public transportation. 
The bill died quickly. When the Los Angeles City Council received a draft, it was unanimously rejected. Councilman David Ryu wrote the resolution opposing the bill, stating that its adoption would result in a “housing boom for a privileged few and eviction notices for everyone else.” Essentially, the bill was dismissed over fears of gentrification. 
This reaction is understandable. If gentrification goes uncontrolled, it is absolutely a damaging process. Beautifying a poor neighborhood is not worth sacrificing its already vulnerable inhabitants. However, L.A. and California lawmakers’ fear of gentrification, and in particular, the type of gentrification that SB 827 would create, is misguided. 
The truth is that gentrification itself isn’t harmful; displacement is. Nobody is opposed to improved school districts, cleaner sidewalks or reduced crime; people are instead opposed to the rising living costs such as increased gas and grocery prices that often accompany these benefits. However, the link between the benefits and the costs aren’t as pronounced as one might expect. A 2005 nationwide study conducted by Columbia University found that the “relationship between gentrification and displacement is not especially robust.” 
Localized studies show varying results, with some indicating increased low-income displacement in certain gentrified areas and the opposite effect in others. These results don’t mean that gentrification doesn’t have the potential to negatively impact neighborhoods — it does. What they do mean is that the impact of rising price levels is complicated, and depends on other factors such as zoning laws, rent control and the speed at which the process takes place. The results call for deliberation but also for action, so that cities can provide safety and opportunity to vulnerable populations, while not threatening their ability to afford the cost of living.
The prioritization of new, dense housing as incentivized by SB 827 would help accomplish this objective. A 2017 UCLA study found that in Los Angeles, six affordable multi-family housing units were created for every single-family unit that was demolished. Basically, the development SB 827 encourages would significantly increase the availability of housing for low-income residents rather than deplete it.
It is also important to note the role of basic supply and demand in the housing crisis. When demand far exceeds supply and production, price levels increase, and in the case of California, that is happening at an uncontrollable rate. Increasing housing options would increase supply thus lowering the price per unit, which would in turn help all Californians, but particularly those who are most vulnerable. 
SB 827 showed promise to provide low-income people with increased access to transportation, education and integration but was rejected in favor of the status quo because of a reflexive fear of developing vulnerable communities. Thankfully, however, the L.A. City Council approved a similar resolution last month which allows for denser development around five stops along the Expo Line west of USC’s campus. Although it is a small step, it signifies a new boldness by the council to enact solutions that actually increase the supply of housing in L.A. This is a boldness that must be both cautiously monitored and encouraged.
Housing policy is the frontline of urban social justice. There is no right more fundamental in a society than the basic right to live in it. Housing shortages aren’t cured by withholding housing, and protecting low-income people isn’t accomplished by letting them be the first to be priced out of California from sheer demand. Well-planned and equitable gentrifying solutions like SB 827 must be considered because the alternative is, to quote Ryu, a California “for a privileged few, and eviction notices for everyone else.”

A junior majoring in public policy and political science, Maria Manjarrez will be joining the California Student Aid Commission as a student representative to contribute to policies. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Last Monday, Gov. Jerry Brown announced the appointment of junior Maria Manjarrez to the California Student Aid Commission, where she will help shape policies around the states’ financial aid systems to make higher education more accessible to all Californians. 
Manjarrez, who is majoring in  public policy and political science, transferred to USC from Pasadena City College in August 2017. As a Norman Topping Scholar, she receives money for expenses like tuition or educational trips, but also relies on CalGrants to afford resources like textbooks. As a student representative for CSAC and through her work in politics, Manjarrez hopes to create change for underrepresented and low-income students like herself. 
“[My parents] have undergone so many extreme circumstances for me to have an education, specifically a quality education here at USC that I will always value and treasure,” Manjarrez said. “So me getting not one but two degrees really is the way for me to pay my parents back for everything they’ve done for me. [It’s] not only because I’m the first person in my family to receive two college diplomas, but [because] I’m also in a field where I can help millions and tons of other people.”
Trista Beard, associate director of the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, said Manjarrez stood out to her as a passionate and hardworking student because she visited the Norman Topping office often to discuss her career goals and inquire about ways to get involved on campus. Beard nominated Manjarrez to travel with the Office of Financial Aid to Sacramento last spring to discuss her CalGrant experiences with legislators and legislative aids. 
“She knows there’s people out there that maybe wouldn’t speak up for themselves or don’t know where they should or could speak up,” Beard said. “So she says ‘I will. I will happily speak up for my community and say there are students out here that really need these grants to get an education, and education can help us even the playing field.’ And she believes that.”
A few months later, Manjarrez received an email from the Office of Financial Aid asking if she would like to be nominated for CSAC — she agreed. After an interview with the governor’s office and a phone call several months later, she was appointed to the two-year position. 
Alejandro Lomeli, a junior at California State University, Long Beach, has served as another student commissioner at CSAC for the past year and will work alongside Manjarrez. According to Lomeli, the Commission is working on removing barriers to give all students, regardless of age or time out of high school, access to the financial assistance they need.
“I think [Manjarrez is] going to bring a lot of expertise from the private sector, which we haven’t seen in a while,” Lomeli said. “Most of the students we’ve had on the Commission have been from UCs or CSUs, so now it looks like we might have a student representing some of the private sectors which are kind of seen as like financial aid [not being] much of a problem over there, so it’ll be nice to have that mentality or that vision from a student living that experience.”
While Manjarrez’s first meeting as a student commissioner isn’t until mid-September, she said she’s been doing research and working with Lomeli to establish the expectations for her role. She’s grateful for the people and organizations that have helped make her education more affordable and hopes to provide the same resources for more students in California.
“What resonates with me a lot is that I see all of these kids, including myself, that work so hard, that come from different walks of life and that there’s a commission dedicated to help kids like us,” Manjarrez said. “And what I like to do, since Topping did so much for me and outside resources have done so much for me, I want to pay it forward now.”

Electronic artist Sam Gellaitry performed at USC’s annual Welcome Back Concert along with indie opener Yeek and R&B artist Arin Ray. Students who attended the concert enjoyed carnival food, games and a “Trojan Market” photo booth. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Students traveled between food trucks and booths scattered around McCarthy Quad as they waited for electronic artist Sam Gellaitry to jump on stage for Saturday’s Welcome Back Concert, which drew over 6,000 attendees.
The event was organized by the USC Concerts Committee, a student-run organization that puts hosts free concerts and special events throughout the school year. 
The committee’s co-director Kira Stiers said the team had been preparing for the event since June. 
“Fiddling all the moving pieces are harder because we are a university,” Stiers said. “There’s only certain vendors we can work with and we have to work through Facilities Management Services and the Trojan Event Services, so it’s been a fast learning [curve].”
According to Stiers, this concert was unlike the ones from previous years; the lineup featured  indie opener Yeek, R&B artist Arin Ray and electronic artist Sam Gellaitry. Stiers said she worked to make sure to have diverse music tastes represented by this year’s performers. 
“We’re doing three artists as opposed to the two that we normally have for Welcome Back [Concert], just because we really wanted to represent the demographics of USC,” Stiers said. “That’s a critique we’ve gotten in the past: that we don’t care to all the types of must people listen to.” 
Flanking McCarthy Quad were rows of food trucks including Billionaire Burger Boyz, The Boba Truck and Share-A-Meal. Vendors such as Pasta Roma and Kobunga Korean Grill passed out free samples of their signature dishes. 
In front of the Von KleinSmid Center, USC Student Affairs arranged carnival food and games including dart throwing, hammer games and popcorn for concert-goers. Students also posed in front of a “Trojan Mart” photo booth and came together to mark their hometowns on a large world map. 
Yeek took the stage around 8 p.m. and performed hits “Shake,” “$even,” “Love & Fame” and “Blood Shot.” Audience responses were less than enthusiastic, as his performance drew boos from the crowd. He ended his set with his song “Only in the West.” 
“Yeek was chill and it was very relaxing,” said Sophia Chi, a freshman majoring in accounting who attended the event. “At some points, [he] could’ve been a little more exciting… It was a bit bland.”
The crowd became reinvigorated as Ray came on stage and performed “With Or Without,” “Communication” and “Stressin” while the crowd cheered. 
The night ended with Sam Gellaitry, a British DJ who found his start on SoundCloud at 17 years old. Gellaitry has said he is influenced by hip-hop and is transitioning from producing  house music to more trap music. 
Gellaitry performed original pieces such as “Long Distance,” “HYENA,” “The Gateway” and “Higher.” Even five hours after the start of the concert, the crowd became energized as it jumped to the beat of his remix of Major Lazer’s “Original Don.” The night ended with Gellaitry’s performance of “Acres.”

Among other changes, the Engemann Student Health Center plans to hire 10 new therapists within the next few months and two more during the next academic year. They also plan to develop more resources for students with long-term mental health needs. (Ankit Mukherjee | Daily Trojan)
In the wake of several lawsuits against former gynecologist George Tyndall and the University, chief health officer Sarah Van Orman discussed updates to Engemann Student Health Center in a letter Monday. 
The letter detailed new programs and changes at Engemann, including the addition of three faculty members to the USC Student Health medical team: physician Erin Jones and gynecologists Anne Michel and Deirdre Logan. 
Van Orman said Michel and Logan will work to maintain the obstetrics-gynecology department at USC up-to-date and accurate. 
“They’re looking at innovative ways to provide care,” Van Orman said. “They also care about outreach. Dr. Michels went out to the LGBT community event on campus and met with the students. They just want to get to know the student population more.”
Van Orman said Robert Mendola, who joined USC Student Health last September, was also appointed as the executive director of Counseling and Mental Health Services. According to the letter, Mendola’s leadership will “expedite progress in optimizing services for student care.”
Van Orman’s letter explained that student counseling services had been dependent on brief assessments,  which “left many students feeling not cared for in the way that we would want.” 
To improve Engemann’s mental health department of, the center aims to hire 10 therapists in the next few months, as well as two more for the following academic year.
“We will move toward providing initial care to nearly all students who seek counseling services, reducing the percentage of referred students from approximately 70 percent to a target of 20 to 30 percent,” Van Orman said in the letter.
Van Orman said that USC Student Health will develop more resources for students with long-term mental health needs with the Keck School of Medicine’s psychiatry department.  Counseling and mental health services will include informal drop-in consultations with counselors across campus and an integrated behavioral health program that places a counselor in the medical clinic for immediate consultation.
Van Orman said that the months following Tyndall’s departure were dedicated to changing the way student health services were being provided. Since last August, she said that USC has integrated student health systems under Keck. On Aug. 7, Board of Trustees Chair Rick Caruso said in a letter that this new effort was made to “further professionalize our care and to bring the resources of our academic medical center to provide the best services to our students.”
“[The integration] means a couple of things,” said Van Orman, who was one of the officials hired from Keck last August. “I think maybe the question that is on a lot of students’ minds is, ‘How can I make sure that the care that I’m getting from [Engemann] is the best quality of care? And that includes with everything that’s happened with Dr. Tyndall, and I think the Keck transition is important for that.”
Before any healthcare providers are hired through Keck, Van Orman said they go through “credentialing and privileging,” which requires the USC Integrative Credentialing Office to review the physician’s background, training, references and overall qualifications before they start seeing patients. If anyone files a complaint about the physician, then the Office will conduct further investigation into the physician’s behavior. 
“This gives [students] a level of assurance that any care that is provided here is being overseen not just by myself and our medical directors, but our whole team of people within the various departments of family medicine and risk management,” Van Orman said. “[We really want to make] sure that if anything is going on, then they are fully investigated and evaluated.” 
Van Orman said she has been working closely to help prevent sexual assault and violence. A new position aimed at education and prevention work was recently created at the center, and Engemann will launch a new survey this spring.
“We are very concerned if students will trust us, and we know we have a lot of work to do to rebuild the trust of our student population,” Van Orman said. “We also developed a Sensitive Health Exam [guide], which really walks students step-by-step through what to expect during a breast exam, pelvic exam, rectal exam … so they can really feel in control.”
Van Orman emphasized that many things within Engemann will continue to improve and change.
“We’ve got lots of things in motion, but we really have an opportunity and a need to make sure we are investing and doing the best things possible for students’ health to help rebuild back that trust,” Van Orman said.
