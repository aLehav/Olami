The couple charged with killing a USC student in a hit-and-run last spring pleaded no contest Thursday to charges of vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident.
Claudia Cabrera, 31, admitted she was the driver of a car that fatally struck 18-year-old Adrianna Bachan and injured fellow student Marcus Garfinkle at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street on March 29, 2009.
Josue Luna, Cabrera’s husband and the passenger of the car that struck Bachan and Garfinkle, admitted to pulling Garfinkle off the hood of the car before the couple drove away.
The trial for Cabrera and Luna was set to start today, but before proceedings began both pleaded no contest to one felony count of leaving the scene of an accident. Cabrera also pleaded no contest to a charge of misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter.
A no contest plea is the same as a guilty plea in the eyes of a court; there will be no trial and no sentence negotiation, which means they both could face the maximum sentences. Cabrera’s maximum sentence is eight years in state prison and Luna could face up to seven years, according to Jane Robison at the District Attorney’s Office.
Cabrera and Luna will return to court May 24 for sentencing.

Howard Stern’s controversial comments about Precious star 
Radio host Howard Stern offended several people Monday while recapping Sunday’s Academy Awards. Stern, who’s radio show is broadcast on Sirius Satellite Radio, said some controversial comments about Gabourey Sidibe, who was nominated for best actress.
While recapping the segment of the show when the best actress winner was about to be announced when Sidibe was shown on the screen, Stern said he saw “the most enormous, fat black chick I’ve ever seen.”
“You feel bad because everyone pretends that she’s part of show business and she’s never going to be in another movie,” Stern added. “What movie is she going to be in? ‘Blind Side 2?’ She could be the football player.”
Stern also criticized Oprah Winfrey, who presented Sidibe as a nominee, for ‘lying’ to the actress. “When we look at you,” Winfrey told Sidibe from the Oscars stage, “we see a true, American Cinderella who’s on the threshold of a brilliant new career.”
Stern disagreed. “She told an enormous woman the size of a planet that she’s going to have a career,” he said during his broadcast. “Oprah should’ve said, ‘you need to get help, we don’t want to lose you.’ “
Wow, Mr. Stern. That was pretty bold.
Rihanna goes home and meet new beau’s parents 
While Chris Brown was parading his new girlfriend in front of the cameras this weekend in Virginia, Rihanna left a gig early in Brazil to make it back stateside to meet her current boyfriend Matt Kemp at his hometown in Arizona. Kemp is an MLB baseball player for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Matt was hosting his “Ante Up for Autism” event to benefit Autism research and Rihanna decided to stop by to show some support. Also while in Arizona, she is said to have visited his family’s house and met his parents.
So how did the meet-in-greet go? According to E!, “Matt was happy she came,” says an inside source about Rihanna making it to the event. “It was an awesome show of support.”
Besides the other pro baseball players in the house Saturday evening, Kemp’s family also attended, and they met Rihanna for the first time. “Rihanna fit right in as if they all knew each other. It was comfortable.”
What did you think of the Oscars? 
History was definitely made this past weekend at the Academy Awards, but what will you remember about this year’s celebration in particular? I believe this year’s show was remarkable for its adequate amount of feel-good themes and moments. Maybe it was the standing ovation for the first female winner of the best director title. Or maybe it was the number of first-time nominees that took home a heavy-looking naked golden men award. Or possibly it was the moving John Hughes tribute. Both serious and amusing – here are a few topics that I thought were ones for the history books.
The ‘Kanye moment’ — The win for best documentary short took an odd turn when the film’s producer, Elinor Burkett, grabbed the microphone away from director-producer Roger Ross Williams during the acceptance speech.
Oprah — Mrs. Winfrey looked absolutely ravishing as she stood on the Oscars stage to present Gabourey Sidibe with her best actress award nomination for Precious. But, where was she sitting during the show? They never showed her once until she appeared on stage at the end of the show! She must have demanded her own private viewing room.
Katherine Bigelow wins for The Hurt Locker — She was the first woman to win an Oscar for best director, but she hopes that she won’t be the last. “I hope that I’m the first of many,” she said to E! backstage at the Academy Awards Sunday.
Geoffey Fletcher wins for Precious — He was the first African-American to win an Oscar for best screenwriting.
Sandra Bullock wins for The Blind Side — She took home the best actress award and gave a sincere acceptance speech, in which she movingly acknowledged her mother who died in 2002.
Ben Stiller — I give the best-dressed award to him for his Avatar-themed look he showed off on the Oscars stage. He dressed himself as an avatar, with Na’vi blue face and hands, a headful of tribal plaits, and staring yellow alien eyes. After walking on stage with a blank face Stiller said, “this idea seemed better in the dressing room.”
Zoe Saldana‘s dress — Now, I really give the best-dressed award to Saldana. She wore a stunning Givenchy gown, shadow-dyed from lilac, on the crystal-embroidered bodice, down to electric violet, on the bouffant hem. The young Italian, Riccardo Tisci, designed the gown.
Where was Farrah? — Fawcett was left of the annual ‘In Memoriam’ section of the telecast. The executive director of the film academy said Tuesday that Farrah Fawcett wasn’t included in the Academy Awards’ ‘In Memoriam’ segment because the actress was better known as a TV star.
Mo’nique wins for Precious — She won best supporting actress for her work in Precious. Her acceptance speech was a little sketchy, though. In the acceptance speech she commended the Academy for judging the “work and not the politics.” That comment left many viewers and audience members confused. She went on to talk about how her husband, Sidney Hicks, really made this movie possible for her. Hicks also serves as her manager. I was way too confused when she got done talking.
iPad commercial — Apple premiered its first commercial for the much talked about Apple iPad, which will be released in April. Apple CEO, Steve Jobs, was in attendance at the award show.
Did any of my moments end up on your most-memorable list? Let me know your thoughts below.

USC Trustee Rick Caruso, the developer of the Grove and the Americana at Brand, is undertaking his next major project — transforming shopping and dining opportunities for travelers.
Caruso plans to start his search for retail and restaurant development at U.S. airports in Los Angeles, he told the Los Angeles Times on Monday.
“Airports and cities across the country realize that they can’t simply take the customer for granted any longer and need to create a more inviting shopping and dining experience for the traveler,” Caruso told the Times.
His company, Caruso Affiliated, is known for developing hot spots in Los Angeles and other large shopping centers.
Caruso wants to take his inviting style and quality developments to improve airports and the overall traveling experience.
“With travelers spending more time in terminals, airport authorities realize the financial value of offering something special, because people are willing to spend more if you provide style, quality and service,” he said.

Zooey, perhaps before deriding the provost’s achievements, a semicolon lesson would be useful. So what if he has lesser accomplishments than engineering the microwave control panel? What matters is that he maintain the trajectory of upward quality that Dr. Sample has fastidiously guided us on.
Zooey. Your pessimism represents a giant step backward for the University of Southern California.
Zooey – it sounds like you have a personal grudge against him. I think he is a great choice based on his accomplishments with the IMSC, as Dean of the engineering school and the groundbreaking work as provost – not to mention being tutored by one of the great university presidents around.
Larry, perhaps you have not been following this selection process nor the University’s progress and the changing nature of higher education over the past 20 years. When a family, such as mine, has been committed to a school as fine as USC for three of its generations; it is a great disappointment to observe a closed selection process for which the outcome was preordained. This is particularly so in that at this point in USC’s history; we could have done so much better. To Dr. Nikias’ accomplishments, I’d point out those of his predecessors dwarf those you enumerate. I bear no grudges but will point out that for all Trojans whom I have had the honor to know; Troy is very personal and will always remain so.
This appointment and confirmation represent a giant step backwards for the University of Southern California. As a third generation Trojan alumnus whose family has been associated with the University since its founding; it is clear that our Alma Mater is marching backwards into mediocrity. Given that Dr. Nikias is neither an educator nor by any stretch of the imagination as accomplished a scholar as his predecessors; I fear for what such an obviously bad choice will portend. I suspect the good news is that Dr. Michael Jackson’s preference for USC’s next president, former Secretary of State (and Stanford Provost) Condoleezza Rice was not selected. Moreover, since none of the other candidates were ever made known to the larger Trojan Family; the bad news is that no one, anyone, better qualified than Dr. Nikias was selected and/or chose to take the position. Now all of Troy gets to learn what Fight On really means.
Zooey, you are a querulous individual. 
So how do you portend the big picture of President Nikias’ tenure? Because I doubt you got a crystal ball. 
Let me reiterate a lesson I learned in BUAD 497. Promoting from within is a more promising bet for future success than promoting an outsider. Outsiders usually don’t have emotional ties to the firm they take over, thus they just see it as a mean to an end–a big paycheck, stock options, and a golden parachute–after they let the ship sink. Ford is an exception. The current CEO is the former CEO for HP computers, and he turned Ford around to profits. Prior to that, Ford only promoted within their family, literally. Sometimes an outsider, and one who isn’t an expert per se in the field (Nikias not being an educator/scholar per se) can bring success…Pete Caroll was not an MVP in the NFL or other football standout.
congrats dude
so pruhfeshionul!
