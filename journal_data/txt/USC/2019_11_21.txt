Daily Trojan sports managing editor Aidan Berg chatted with Daily Bruin sports editor Sam Connon about this year’s Victory Bell matchup. 
DT: Which UCLA team will show up to the Coliseum: the one that got destroyed by Utah or the one that went on a three-game winning streak just before that?
DB: I’d like to say the one that went on the three-game winning streak. Even though head coach Chip Kelly has a losing record overall, his teams have typically come up in big moments. The Utah game is definitely a speed bump, and I don’t want to completely overlook it since there were some pretty glaring flaws. But part of me thinks that was a good learning moment for the team and that it’ll be more of the past month’s team coming to USC as opposed to the Utah game.
DT: Redshirt senior running back Joshua Kelley killed the Trojans last year. What are the chances he takes over the game again?
DB: I think they’re pretty high because it’s one of his last games at UCLA. He’s a big emotional guy, and I think this would be a great moment for him. Just based on that alone, I think he’ll have a good day. Early in the game, they’ll look to establish the running game through Kelley. If UCLA can get out to an early lead and force two or three three-and-outs in the first quarter for USC, then the whole game rests on Kelley. I don’t think he’ll be breaking records again, but if UCLA wants to win this game, then he has to be a big part of the offense for sure.
DT: How do you think these two teams match up?
DB: UCLA is a team that plays really well as the underdog. When they have games where they’re favored, like San Diego State or last year against Cincinnati, then they haven’t really done too well. But when the expectations are low, that’s when they thrive. When they can kind of be sneaky and scrappy as an underdog, I think that’s when they play their best football.
DT: UCLA has an identical 2-3 record both home and away. Does it matter that this game is at the Coliseum?
DB: I don’t think it does. The Washington State game was a pretty tough environment, and they came back. They’ve been embarrassed at home against San Diego State, whom they’d never lost to. Whether it’s because the Rose Bowl crowd is weak or if it’s because they’re a surprisingly good road team, I don’t know. But just going back to two years ago, USC was the better team but UCLA made it a good game and almost came back and won despite it being a big crowd at USC. Because it’s L.A. versus L.A., the crowd doesn’t really matter all too much. 
DT: From a UCLA perspective, what part of USC’s game are you most looking out for?
DB: The Michael Pittman Jr. against Darnay Holmes matchup. I assume they’ll do man on Pittman, and I’m just curious to see how that goes. UCLA has played some pretty good teams, but Pittman’s probably the best receiver they’ve played next to CeeDee Lamb from Oklahoma, and Lamb tore them up. I think that Pittman is going to do so too, but I’m curious to see what Kelly and defensive coordinator Jerry Azzinaro have learned from getting torn up by Lamb two months ago. 
DT: It’s been an up-and-down year for Dorian Thompson-Robinson. What do you expect to see from him Saturday?
DB: Well, if you just go by recency bias, then he’s very turnover-prone. Against Utah, he had four, he’s had at least one turnover in every game this year. He’s had a couple where he’s had multiple turnovers. That’s definitely a big issue with him, but at the same time, he’s a great runner. He can stay alive in the pocket for so long, he can scramble, he can get these chunk plays, break out 20-yard runs seemingly with ease. And that’s just something that’s huge for UCLA, something they didn’t really have last year. So Thompson-Robinson has come a long way as a runner, but he still needs to fix the decision-making and ball security. 
DT: Who is an unsung player  you think could play a huge role for the Bruins Saturday?
DB: I think on the offensive side, it has to be freshman wide receiver Kyle Philips. He’ll have his games where he picks up 10 receptions, and then they’ll have games where he only gets two. And that’s the way the offense works this year; there hasn’t really been a go-to guy, but when he’s racking up those receptions, and when he’s an easy go-to guy, whether it’s outside the numbers or in the slot, I feel like that’s when the offense moves best. And they’re going to need to move really well to keep up with USC.

It’s hard not to think of music when watching Olaijah Griffin play football. 
There’s a rhythmic energy to the sophomore cornerback’s footwork and his ability to react to the receiver he’s covering, similar to the improvisational ability of some of the greatest jazz musicians. There are the leaping deflections he makes to keep receivers from getting their hands on the ball. There’s a grace with which he covers ground and jumps high in the air, arms outstretched. On the field, he’s the skilled ballroom dancer on a dance floor. 
The connections are no accident, Griffin admits. As the son of rapper, songwriter and producer Warren G, music has undoubtedly influenced and, in his opinion, assisted his game.
“You’ve got to have a good rhythm to have good technique as well,” Griffin told the Daily Trojan.  “And so once those two kick in, it’s just like a beat just going in my head that just matches with my feet. And that’s why I think I have great feet. And my rhythm is just on point.”
Football and music have been two of Griffin’s greatest loves in his life. To this day, he enjoys getting in the recording studio at his family’s house, playing around with his dad’s equipment and having fun on the drum machine.
But his family, including his father, also helped Griffin discover his true passion on the gridiron.
He recalls watching former Browns running back Jim Brown on TV and mimicking his plays on the field. He was just 4 years old.
 “One day, my [older] brother went to practice, and I was too young to play, but I was practicing with him,” he said. “And once it was my time, I put on the cleats and I shocked everybody on the field.”
Griffin’s background has played a prominent role in his sports career. He has a self-assured nature that comes naturally from seeing high-profile celebrities visit his home from an early age. The lights of the Coliseum don’t seem too bright in contrast.
Fans may have noticed Griffin frequently dances during games, whether it be on the sideline, during timeouts or waiting for kickoffs. That’s just part of who he is; he has a deep appreciation for how music and rhythm affect life — and it’s hard for him to contain.
“Music to me is just something that’s always in my head,” Griffin said. “That’s why people see me dancing on the sideline, because just being around music, just getting the rhythm, hearing beats, it’s just something that makes me move, and that’s something I love as well. The world wouldn’t even be the same without music.”
Griffin’s expressive nature has endeared him to his Trojan teammates, who know him as “OG.”
“He’s a dude that can dance a lot, that’s for sure,” sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga said. “He just brings a great attitude of energy — a sense of charisma. Everybody wants to be around him all the time.”
Griffin’s moves are a hot topic of discussion among his teammates. Redshirt sophomore safety Isaiah Pola-Mao joked that he thinks Griffin sits in his room for hours on end dancing in the mirror to see what he thinks looks cool.
Freshman defensive lineman Drake Jackson, in particular, connected with Griffin upon arriving at USC. Jackson said he was drawn to both Griffin’s musicality and his comedic nature.
“He’s jokes. Funniest guy ever,” Jackson said. “He’s just full of energy, always dancing, always hyping other people up. Being around OG — he makes sure you’re naturally happy.”
Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said Griffin has learned to channel his energy in a way that helps the team.
“Music to me is just something that’s always in my head. That’s why people see me dancing on the sideline, because just being around music, just getting the rhythm, hearing beats, it’s just something that makes me move, and that’s something I love as well. The world wouldn’t even be the same without music.”
“He’s [got] attention to detail,” Pendergast said. “He wants to be the best that he can be at his position. And, you know, he’s a guy that loves challenges, and that’s one of the things I liked about him as a player.”
Griffin’s passion doesn’t always manifest itself in productive or entertaining ways, though. Too many times this season he has let his competitiveness get the best of him, picking up bad unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for late and unnecessary hits. That’s something he needs to iron out, but it’s also part of the OG experience — for now. He wouldn’t be the same player if he wasn’t ruled by his need to succeed.
That desire traces back to early childhood, when he first fell in love with football. From a young age, Griffin always knew he wanted to go to the NFL.
“That’s a dream that I’m trying to fulfill, and I’m getting closer to that accomplishment, and that’s something I’m proud of as of right now,” he said. “But I just need to keep going.”
He’s certainly progressing along that path. Despite being a sophomore, Griffin has established himself as the team’s top cornerback. Granted, just about every corner on the team’s roster is a sophomore or younger, but Griffin has set himself apart with his growth from his freshman season. Pendergast noted Griffin’s jump in performance and chalked it up to improved focus.
However, it hasn’t always been easy for Griffin. After undergoing surgery on both of his shoulders over the offseason, Griffin struggled with back spasms that kept him out of the Washington and Arizona games. At times, he said, the recovery process was disheartening.
“At first, I didn’t think I was going to be the same because I was out for so long,” Griffin said. “I never had football not [be] in my life for that long, and just to be back and doing more than what I was doing before, it’s just a great feeling.” 
Griffin said a big reason for his development was his relationship with former USC cornerback Iman Marshall, who was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the fourth round of this year’s NFL Draft. The two Long Beach products had known each other for years before Griffin arrived on campus, and their relationship only grew when they became teammates.
“Just seeing him playing and getting the chance to see him play in front of my eyes, it was just a great experience,” Griffin said. “But now I know it’s my time to finally take over his place.”
Griffin speaks about all of his teammates, especially the defensive backs, as though they are family. But there was a time that he seemed unlikely to become as ingrained in the USC culture as he is now. After initially committing to UCLA, the five-star recruit didn’t choose the Trojans until National Signing Day.
It was Griffin’s given family that ultimately played the biggest role in determining his chosen family. When he switched schools, he picked USC so that his family could still come see him play every game, and he doesn’t take their support for granted.
“It means everything to me, because even while I’m playing, I could hear my family’s voice cheering me on or telling me something that I need to know,” he said.
Griffin is proud of his family name and his role in representing it. He said his 4-year-old brother Royal loves watching him play and that he wants to be a role model for him. Griffin could hardly contain his smile when he said he hopes Royal turns out like him.
Increased attention comes with the territory of having a famous father, but it’s not too often that celebrities’ family members make waves in their own right. 
In OG’s case, however, the son of the star has already made a name for himself.

Michael Pittman Jr. is undoubtedly the face of USC football. 
The senior wide receiver is dominating his final season as a Trojan, with 82 receptions and 1,118 yards through 11 games. Pittman is a fan favorite, and at times, his play on the gridiron looks almost effortless. 
But things haven’t always come so easy for Pittman. Long before he was stutter-stepping around cornerbacks and avoiding defenders in his way, he was stuttering through sentences and avoiding public speaking due to a speech impediment that’s affected him from a young age. 
There have been times in football and his personal life when Pittman wanted to speak up but chose not to because he couldn’t get his words out right. It’s a condition Pittman has carried his whole life.
“I remember him younger, it was way worse,” said Pittman’s brother Mycah, who would occasionally crack light-hearted jokes at Michael about his speech. “He couldn’t even open the refrigerator and turn around and tell you what was in the refrigerator.” 
But as he grew older, Michael learned to cope with his stutter and no longer silences himself when he has something to say. He has been forced to choose his words carefully and draw out sentences to stay away from words he anticipates tripping up on, but he has accepted his stutter as something out of his control rather than a flaw. 
“It’s tough because you want to say something, but then you stumble up, and people are looking at you like, ‘Wow, this dude’s dumb, he’s stupid,’ or ‘He can’t talk right,’ or ‘He’s weird’ or something,” Michael said. “But I just overcame that. I still stutter pretty good, but I just kind of keep going anyways, and people are just going to have to wait for me to get it out.”
Pittman’s stutter may have affected him on the field and in the classroom — but it doesn’t seem to affect him much on camera. 
Pittman’s girlfriend, Kianna Galli, had wanted to start a YouTube channel for quite some time, so about eight months ago, Pittman bought a camera, and the couple started filming. On April 9, the “Michael and Kianna” YouTube channel debuted with a “What’s in the Box” challenge, where the couple tried to guess the contents inside a cardboard box based on sense of touch.
That video — in which Pittman appeared equally as frightened of a teddy bear as did Galli of a cow tongue — was the first of 13 videos (and counting), featuring gameday vlogs, an apartment remodeling with the football team and other clips such as Pittman throwing cheese slices at several of his teammates’ faces. 
The couple now has more than 22,000 subscribers, and their Stanford gameday vlog has amassed more than 270,000 views. 
Pittman’s teammates are often the subjects of his YouTube content, and they gladly welcome the limelight — even if that requires having dairy products hurled at them. 
“Even though I don’t have a ton of subs, all of my videos get pretty good views, so they just want to be on camera,” Pittman said.
Michael and Kianna’s videos often feature guest appearances by Bosco, their cane corso, who has his own Instagram account — which is fitting for someone Mycah unsurprisingly describes as an animal lover.
But of course, any YouTube star and dog whisperer needs his side hobby. For Pittman, that is — you guessed it — football. 
OK, it might be a little more than a side hobby. Football, for Pittman, is a family affair: His father, Michael Sr., played in the NFL, and Mycah is a freshman wide receiver at the University of Oregon. 
Michael Sr. picked up more than 9,000 yards from scrimmage through 11 professional seasons and won the 2003 Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Still, if you ask Michael Jr. to rank the three of them, he won’t even hesitate to put himself first, Mycah second and his dad last — an order Mycah called “completely false.” 
Growing up with two elite football players helped improve Michael’s game, but in the end, it always came back to competition. 
“It’s really just me trying to set a high standard for my brother because I can’t let him pass me up, so I gotta do something special this year so I can say that I was better than him in college,” Michael said. “But he still has a lot of time, and he’s doing great there, so I’m just trying to go as high as I can this year so I can hopefully say that I did something that he didn’t.”
Growing up, the two often teamed up together on the gridiron, but when they face each other, the trash talk ensues. 
When the Ducks faced off against the Trojans at the Coliseum on Nov. 2, Mycah made his presence felt with a 35-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. Though the game was largely out of reach at that point anyway, the play carried plenty of significance.
“I was thinking, ‘Alright, Oregon beat us, but I can say that [Mycah] didn’t score,’ and then bam — he scores,” Michael said. “So all of my trash talk just went out the window, and now I’ve just got to hear whatever he has to say.”
Sometimes, the brothers’ trash talk turns into the silent treatment. Mycah learned that the hard way after Oregon’s 56-24 victory. 
“All I wanted was a freaking hug,” Mycah said. “I was like, ‘Dude, you have to give me a hug at the ’SC logo after we beat y’all.’ And he said, ‘Alright, alright, we’ll see about that’ … He ended up not wanting to give me the hug. He jogged straight to the locker room.”
But Michael is never that standoffish with anyone else. He’s known for his kindness and often goes out of his way to sign autographs and take pictures with fans.
Earlier this month, USC Athletics tweeted a video of a boy yelling words of encouragement to Trojan players on their walk to the stadium before calling Michael’s name specifically. The senior, with his headphones on, didn’t notice the kid, but he later saw the video on Twitter. 
Michael sent out a tweet calling for help finding the boy’s father. The next day, Pittman personally delivered a No. 6 USC jersey signed by the entire team to the boy’s house.
“I just feel like I’ve been given a gift, and I’ve just been so blessed, so I just want to share that with other people,” the wide receiver said. “I feel like guys sometimes can get that idea that they’re bigger than everybody else because they’re good at football. But really, football’s cool, but it’s more about what type of person you are.”
“I just feel like I’ve been given a gift, and I’ve just been so blessed, so I just want to share that with other people… I feel like guys sometimes can get that idea that they’re bigger than everybody else because they’re good at football. But really, football’s cool, but it’s more about what type of person you are.”
Mycah said his brother has been that way his whole life. 
“I know when this guy goes to the NFL, what his first check is going to go to is the family and everybody and make sure everybody’s taken care of because that’s just how he is,” Mycah said. “That’s just the character we were raised to be as … He always goes out of the way for others and always believes in good karma.”
Michael’s road to greatness hasn’t been a seamless one. In his first two years of college, he averaged just 6.3 and 36.7 receiving yards per game, prompting his father to publicly call out USC’s coaches and imply that maybe the school wasn’t the best fit for his son. 
“That feels like forever ago,” Michael said. “I actually remember talking to him, telling him not to say nothing, that everything is going to work out. He was just trying to protect me, and he was frustrated. I’m glad it blew over, because if I wouldn’t have went out and played well then I would’ve gotten slammed.”
His last two years have been nothing like his first two. He has emerged as a potential early-round pick in April’s NFL Draft and has been a rare constant in a turbulent season for USC. 
“I’m so proud for him and the senior year that he’s had,” head coach Clay Helton said. “I couldn’t wish anything better for him.”
This season wasn’t a guarantee, though. After his junior year, Pittman had a choice: stay for one last hoorah or go pro. He decided there was unfinished business at USC. 
“There was just a lot more left that I had to do, and there’s still a lot more left that I’m still pushing for,” Pittman said. “I’m still pushing for All-American, still trying to get in that Biletnikoff race [for college football’s top receiver — for which Pittman is a finalist], and who knows what happens then. I just felt like there was more left for me to do because I felt like if I left last year, people wouldn’t remember me here.”
Now, for the final time, Pittman is about to take on the rival UCLA — the school he originally committed to before flipping to USC. Pittman received four offers within three weeks of his junior year in high school. Thinking he had just those to choose from, Pittman decided on the Bruins. Later, more offers came. USC called — and the rest is history.
Pittman went out with a bang in his final high school game, posting an absurd line of 16 receptions for 354 yards and five touchdowns. He thinks there’s an encore in store for his final regular season college game, though it hasn’t quite sunk in that it’s all coming to an end. 
“It’s just happened so fast,” Pittman said. “I’m just so blessed to be part of this team and part of this brotherhood that I can’t see it ending.” 
Whatever happens in the rivalry game and the following bowl game, his head coach knows the team’s captain will make an impact well after his college days. 
“He does everything right,” Helton said of Pittman. “I think there’s a reason that everybody in the NFL is going to love this kid. Whoever gets the guy is getting somebody that’s been trained and is ready for the next level.”
USC is one of the most historic football programs in the nation, and fans certainly celebrate the players that show up on Saturdays. But excellence on the field isn’t the only component of becoming a USC great. 
Pittman is living proof of that.

It’s that time of year again — rivalry week in Los Angeles. Coming off two road victories, USC will face crosstown foe UCLA Saturday afternoon as the Trojans look to pick up a third straight win and finish the regular season 8-4.
USC’s Air Raid offense was electric against Cal, putting up 41 points against a typically stingy secondary.
The Trojans’ young offensive talent was on full display. Freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis posted his third 400-plus-yard outing in four games, while freshman wideout Drake London had his first game with more than 100 yards receiving.
Offensive coordinator Graham Harrell called for numerous deep balls against Cal, allowing for the Trojans’ elite wide receiving corps to come down with big plays.
“We have receivers who can go make plays down the field,” Harrell said. “So as always in the game plan, they were playing a coverage that allowed us to take some shots and have the opportunities to get some big ones, and then we did.”
Unlike Cal’s secondary, UCLA’s defensive backfield has been subpar, allowing 298.4 receiving yards per game and 27 passing touchdowns over 10 games. With Slovis’ hot hand and the talent of London and receivers senior Michael Pittman Jr. and sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown, the Trojans will look to exploit UCLA through the air.
Although the Trojans’ offensive productivity is hardly concerning given that the team is putting up 31.5 points per game, USC cannot afford to become complacent. Two games ago against Arizona State, the Trojans put up 28 first-quarter points but were only able to punch in a single field goal the rest of the game, allowing ASU to come within striking distance.
USC must also put together a defensive effort similar to that against Cal to be successful Saturday. The Trojans allowed the Bears just 17 points, only 7 of which came in the second half. This came after two straight poor defensive performances: USC conceded 56 points at home to Oregon and then allowed its contest against ASU to become a close game.
The key to maintaining a solid defensive effort will be coming away with turnovers. The Trojans picked off Cal redshirt junior quarterback Devon Modster twice, resulting in the Bears’ abysmal second half.
UCLA sophomore quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson has been struggling with accuracy this season, throwing 10 interceptions through nine games. He had an absurd 507-yard outing against Washington State earlier this season with five touchdowns to boot but has not had a performance over 250 yards since.
The Trojans cannot simply focus on Thompson-Robinson’s passing ability, though; they must also consider his shiftiness in and out of the pocket. He has four games this season with a rush longer than 20 yards, demonstrating his ability to create plays when his receivers aren’t open. Freshman defensive lineman Drake Jackson, who had a sack on Modster last week, will play an integral part in containing Thompson-Robinson.
Although Utah’s dominant victory against UCLA narrowed the Trojans’ already-slim Pac-12 chances even further, USC is not taking this game lightly.
“[We’ve] just [got to do] our part really, win every game that we can,” junior offensive lineman Austin Jackson said. “We’ve got UCLA coming up. It’s a rivalry and Pac-12 South matchup, so it should be fun, and we’ve got a lot of work to get to.”

Consult the message boards and you’d think the Trojans were 3-8 and on the verge of a teamwide mutiny. But in a season filled with fan negativity, head coaching rumors and crippling injuries, USC has a chance to finish the regular season 8-4 with a win over UCLA. 
The players deserve credit for staying focused through adversity and maintaining a championship mindset even when their season appeared to be taking a nosedive three or four different times. 
Seniors like wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. deserve credit for keeping the locker room together after the team’s most crushing setback — an embarrassing 32-point loss to Oregon. 
Once winning the Pac-12 South became a long shot, Pittman could have made the season all about improving his NFL Draft stock. In the past few years, we’ve even seen players of his caliber — including Ohio State defensive end Nick Bosa and LSU running back Leonard Fournette — cut their seasons short to start prepping for the Combine.
Pittman, who stayed for his senior year following USC’s worst season in almost two decades, would sooner drop a wide-open pass in the end zone than think of turning his back on his team. 
Pittman has certainly earned himself a lot of money on the field this season. But he’s also helped keep the team together by leading by example. Following the Cal win, he could have basked in his ridiculous 11-catch, 180-yard performance. He certainly earned that right. Instead, he showed why NFL teams are going to fall in love with his attitude just as much as they will with his leaping ability, speed and ball skills. 
USC has often shown flashes of brilliance but rarely the consistency to put it together for all four quarters. An impact coaching change will be the first step in marrying elite talent with elite execution. 
“Honestly, I felt like I didn’t play that good,” said Pittman, who should really teach a class on humility. “I felt like I left 100 more yards out there.”
Freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis also deserves loads of credit. Not only did he take over an offense that could have collapsed after losing sophomore starting quarterback JT Daniels, but he made that offense prolific. Slovis has thrown for 400 or more yards in three of his last four games. To put that in perspective, former USC quarterback Sam Darnold topped 400 yards just once in 27 career games. 
Slovis’ decision-making and pocket presence have gotten better with each and every week. He’s also thrown for four touchdowns in three of the past four games. Forget him putting together one of the best freshman seasons by a USC quarterback: He’s having one of the best seasons by a freshman at any position in school history.
Speaking of Slovis’ development, offensive coordinator Graham Harrell deserves credit for grooming the three-star recruit this offseason and letting him power the offense once he assumed the starting job. Time and time again, Harrell has given the Arizona native room to take risks and make mistakes.
A few weeks ago, Harrell talked about how excited he was to have Slovis for another full offseason, touting the improvements his former protege Mason Fine made at North Texas from year one to two in his offense. The caveat is that no one is certain Harrell will get the chance to continue working with Slovis beyond this season. 
Whatever happens, Harrell has coached himself into the conversation of sticking around. Sure, there have been spotty moments and questionable calls in the red zone. But it’s tantalizing to imagine how much further Slovis could grow under his tutelage with much of USC’s talented receiving corps returning next season. 
Many will be quick to call this a lost season for the Trojans, but it feels more like a transitional one. With a freshman quarterback and young stars such as freshman defensive end Drake Jackson and sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga on defense, this team will be stacked with talent for the foreseeable future.
USC has often shown flashes of brilliance but rarely the consistency to put it together for all four quarters. An impact coaching change will be the first step in marrying elite talent with elite execution. New athletic director Mike Bohn seems likely to bring someone in to fill head coach Clay Helton’s role, with names like Urban Meyer and Penn State’s James Franklin floating around. 
For now, the Trojan fan base should celebrate these players and what they’ve accomplished this season despite being written off time and time again… Change is coming, and the institution realizes the program isn’t where it needs to be.
For now, the Trojan fan base should celebrate these players and what they’ve accomplished this season despite being written off time and time again. It may feel like settling for something less than greatness, but it’s not. Change is coming, and the institution realizes the program isn’t where it needs to be. Until that happens, players like Pittman, Slovis and Jackson deserve your support, even if they’re not playing for a Rose Bowl. 
Of course, I can’t write about the state of USC football without mentioning its abysmal 2020 recruiting class that ranks behind teams like Appalachian State, Bowling Green and North Texas, according to 247 Sports. 
So, I’ll leave you with this: We know recruits are tuned into the uncertainty at head coach and the embarrassing losses like the one against Oregon, but they’re also tuned into fan negativity. The players will suit up for this Saturday’s crosstown showdown and treat it like it’s the Super Bowl. They deserve at least half of that energy from their own fans. Because right now, USC’s recruiting ranking matches up with the attitude of its fanbase.
If the fans want USC to be a championship contender, they must commend the efforts of the players in this transitional season.

Base offense: Pro-style with a dash of pistol
Run-pass percentage: 53.9% run, 46.1% pass
Strength: Explosive plays
Weakness: Turnovers, converting on third down
X Factors: Redshirt junior running back Demetric Felton, redshirt freshman wide receiver Kyle Philips
For almost a month, it looked like the UCLA offense might be the best in the Pac-12. After a 1-5 start to the season, the Bruins appeared to have righted the ship, rattling off three straight double-digit wins against Pac-12 opponents on the back of the conference’s most productive offense.
Over that three-game stretch, UCLA averaged 36 points per game. In fact, in the team’s last six games before Saturday’s blowout loss to Utah, the Bruins posted a remarkably healthy 478 yards per game. They generated that offense in balanced fashion, averaging 261 yards through the air and 217 on the ground. 
Head coach Chip Kelly has been willing to embrace a run-first philosophy, as evidenced by UCLA’s run-pass ratio in a conference where traditional pro-style stalwarts like USC have shifted to newer Air Raid systems. 
Redshirt senior running back Joshua Kelley has been a force this year, rushing for 939 yards and 10 touchdowns so far. The Trojans shouldn’t need to look at the stat sheet to know what he can do — last year, he dropped 289 yards and two touchdowns on them as he led the Bruins past USC for the first time in four years. Kelley is a patient runner — he needs to be, given UCLA’s unreliable offensive line. 
Kelley’s ability to produce at such a high level creates opportunities for sophomore quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson. Thompson-Robinson seems far more comfortable in this offense than he did last season, and it has shown in his ability to create big plays through the air.
Explosive plays are the calling card of this Bruin offense, and Thompson-Robinson’s deep ball makes that possible. When comfortable, he can hurl bombs. 
We don’t talk enough about Dorian Thompson-Robinson  pic.twitter.com/ZD0A3hDeTZ
He’s also improved at making short-area reads, something he struggled with early in his career. He has a handsome 17 touchdowns to go with 2,056 passing yards so far; he’ll likely end the season nearly doubling his output from last year. 
Unfortunately for the Bruins, the sophomore has struggled mightily with ball protection. Thompson-Robinson has thrown 10 picks on the year, and he’s fumbled the football 10 times. Over the Bruins’ recent three-game win streak, it seemed that he and the team had improved in that regard, but last week’s matchup against Utah showed that progress to be little more than a mirage. 
The Bruins turned the ball over five times — four courtesy of their quarterback — and were reduced to a smoking husk of themselves for the duration of the contest, held to a pitiful 3 points.
A big part of that collapse came because of an offensive line that couldn’t protect its quarterback. The Bruins gave up five sacks, and it was clear that Thompson-Robinson was rattled most of the night. UCLA can’t rely solely on Kelley and Thompson-Robinson to carry it; it needs strong outings from other weapons to get going. 
Redshirt freshman wide receiver Kyle Philips is a capable threat on the outside, leading the team with five receiving scores. Redshirt junior Demetric Felton is as good of a multi-purpose running back as there is in the Pac-12, evidenced by his 807 scrimmage yards. Both will need to get involved in a critical game for an offense that needs to rediscover its identity.
Base defense: 3-4 with a lot of nickel
Blitz tendency: Medium
Strength: Splash plays
Weakness: Most things
X Factor: Sophomore safety Stephan Blaylock
This is not a good defense. UCLA allows an average of 33.7 points per game — “good” for 100th in the country — and gives up an abysmal 442 passing yards per game.
Though the Bruins allow a respectable 143.6 yards per game on the ground, there’s no area where they consistently find success as a unit. Their outing against Stanford was the group’s best; the Bruins allowed only 16 points and 198 yards on the night in a stifling performance. 
The Bruins have plenty of talent on that side of the ball, which makes it possible for the defense to play better than its ranking at times. Senior linebackers Krys Barnes and Lokeni Toailoa are both adept at playing the run, and junior cornerback Darnay Holmes is an athletic marvel. 
Here’s Darnay Holmes running 1st Round pick N’Keal Harry’s route for him.And then subsequently taking it to the house. pic.twitter.com/K0XmbkzkDL
Blaylock sets the tone for the Bruins on defense, leading the team in tackles and forced fumbles. His ability to make plays in both the run and short passing game is a huge boost for the Bruins, but mistakes like blown tackles are a consistent issue for him. What version of Blaylock shows up Saturday will have a lot to do with how well UCLA counters freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis and the USC passing attack. 
The Bruins are liable to get torched in the secondary, and their pass rush is no serious threat either. It’s likely that their recent defensive “success” was a result of the poor offensive opponents. After all, this is the same unit that gave up 63 points to Washington State only seven games ago. One way or another, UCLA will have its hands full this week with Slovis and the Trojan offense coming off of a dominant 462-yard, five-touchdown performance against Cal.

Rapper and 2016 alumna Saweetie will take Rico Nasty’s place as the headlining performer at the 2019 Conquest Thursday, USC Concerts Committee announced Wednesday.
Concerts Committee Co-Executive Director Leila Kashfi said Rico Nasty dropped out of the performance Wednesday because of unforeseen personal circumstances. Kashfi said the Committee worked with Rico Nasty’s agency throughout the day and was able to secure Saweetie as the main act for the concert.
Saweetie, who released her second EP “ICY” in March, graduated with a communication degree from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. 
The rapper has made several other appearances on campus since she graduated. She attended a Black Student Assembly event last November to talk about her career and was also spotted at this year’s Homecoming tailgate.  
In an August interview with the Daily Trojan, Saweetie discussed her experience transferring to USC, her dream school, from San Diego State University. She talked about her time at USC, which included running a clothing brand and holding jobs at the Marshall School of Business, a sports bar and as a research assistant on campus.
“I’m very high maintenance,” Saweetie told the Daily Trojan. “I like to get my weave, my nails, I like going shopping. I had to keep myself up. And how do you do that? With four jobs.”
“We just think it’s a perfect fit because Conquest is the big spirit alumni event,” Kashfi said. “We saw the buzz already of how excited people were to have her here just tailgating [during Homecoming], so we’re really excited.”
Each year, Conquest also features various food vendors, an esports match against UCLA and visiting sponsors. This year, Chris Begler, a co-executive director for Concerts Committee, said the event will also host several mental health organizations to offer resources to students following a series of student deaths that have impacted the campus community. 
“There’s a lot more going on than what’s on stage, and we’re proud that it’s a well-rounded event,” he said.

Students were pleasantly surprised by the scope of issues that were discussed at the fifth Democratic primary debate, which included issues like foreign policy, paid family leave and health care.
Nearly 75 students watched the debate in the Wallis Annenberg Hall Forum  at a viewing hosted by the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy.
Attendees came out in full support of their preferred candidates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, businessman Andrew Yang and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. 
“I think [Buttigieg] is doing a great job,” said Yoko Rosenbaum, a campus coordinator for Trojans for Pete. “I think that his answers exemplify exactly why I’m supporting him for president.” 
She and five other members held Buttigieg posters and handed out stickers that read “Team Pete 2020” to attendees. 
Students from Trojans for Warren handed out Warren- themed baked goods and held posters that read, “Dream Big, Fight Hard, Warren.” Krishan Patel, the secretary for Trojans for Warren, donned a liberty green Warren T-shirt. 
“A lot of the Trojans for Warren showed up, and we were really happy with that,” he said.  
The debate, held at the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, covered issues ranging from the impeachment inquiries to federal drug policy and white supremacist violence, especially regarding Black people and marijuana policy. 
Throughout the debate, there were moments of significance, like the exchange between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Cory Booker on the legalization vs. decriminalization of marijuana in the United States and Buttigieg’s affirmation of his experience, despite not being in Washington.
“They’re covering a lot of topics they weren’t before,” said Tom Drzik, a freshman majoring in intelligence and cyber operations. “I think they talked about foreign policy a lot more, which I really liked, because they haven’t talked about that much in the past debates, so overall, I’m happy with how it’s going.”
Rachel Holzer, a sophomore majoring in political science and international relations, said she appreciated the candidates’ discussion of housing issues like the lack of housing units made available and the homelessness crisis. 
“I think talking about gentrification is really important, and I think people avoid it sometimes going to USC, so I’m glad that was brought up,” she said. 
Ambar Dange, a freshman majoring in international relations global business, said he wished candidates would have talked more about their plans to address environmental issues like climate change and reaching net-zero carbon emissions. 
“There has to be a serious plan of action about how to take on climate change and in form of what kinds of policy because policy debates is what American voters will be looking for and climate change is one of the most important topics that universally affects everyone regardless of whether they’re Democrat or Republican,” Dange said.
Drzik said he talked to some students who didn’t know about the Wednesday Democratic debate, so he was pleased to see a screening hosted on campus to encourage students to get involved and educate themselves on candidates’ platforms. 
“Regardless of whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican, but especially if you’re a Democratic voter, this is going to be really important, and it’s not far away either,” Drzik said. “Actually seeing what [the candidates] have to say and how they compare to one another, I think it’s really important. If we’re in college, most of us are going to be voters … so I think it’s really great.”

Mario Perez lives paycheck to paycheck in Los Angeles with a family of five. 
Perez has been working as a custodian at USC Housing for 13 years, and with his current salary and benefits, he can barely afford the cost of living in the city. He works a part-time job with Los Angeles Football Club during the summer for extra income, but since the MLS season is over, Perez is struggling to make ends meet. 
“When I’m doing my part-time, I rarely have time to spend with my kids,” Perez said. “So I have to choose extra income or spend time with a family that is not happy.”
Unite Here Local 11, a local union, is handling the contract negotiations on behalf of the 800 housing and hospitality workers at USC. Hospitality includes the food service workers at campus dining options such as residential dining halls and Tutor Campus Center eateries. 
Negotiations started Nov. 13 and are expected to continue over the next few months. The previous five-year contract expired July 1. 
Perez said that workers are asking for a livable wage and a 40-hour work week. They also want to maintain their healthcare plan and include retirement benefits from the previous contract in the new one. 
“We have a management there that’s cutting hours,” Perez said. “They don’t give enough to do for the workers … What are we going to give presents for kids on Christmas?” 
The University maintains that workers are provided adequate salary and benefits that are competitive with other institutions. 
“USC has a long history of successful negotiations with Local 11 to establish fair labor contracts,” the University wrote in a statement. “We are once again working hard to achieve a fair agreement.” 
According to a 2018 report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, Californians need an hourly full-time wage of $32.68 to afford a two-bedroom rental home. Perez said that he has co-workers who have worked at USC for more than 40 years and still make less than $18 an hour. 
“I see my people that have been here for 48 years, we have a lady named Maria giving all her life to USC, and she don’t even get to $18 right after 48 years,” Perez said. “I don’t want to have that happen to me, and I don’t want that to happen to my other co-workers.”
Daniel Vollaire, who works at C&G Juice on the University Park Campus, said management frequently cuts his hours. He recently started a second job at Domino’s Pizza to afford rent.
“When I first got this job, I thought it would be enough to at least rent a little studio, but it’s not,” Vollaire said. “So I’m working two jobs now, [and] it’s still not enough.” 
Vollaire also said USC provides insufficient retroactive pay after the contract negotiation period. Retroactive pay is granted when members work without raises while the union negotiates new contract agreements. Following the 2014 contract agreement, workers were given $400 in retro pay despite being promised $2,000. 
“Most people don’t expect anything,” Vollaire said. “They already have a negative outlook on things, and they’re just used to getting the short end of the stick, so they’ll settle for the $400.” 
During the first contract negotiation session at the USC Hotel last Wednesday, Unite Here Local 11 negotiator Austin Lynch presented worker demands to administrators for higher wages and better working hours. Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation member Stephanie Solis, who was present at the negotiations, said that the University did not express sympathy for the plight of workers. 
“Basically, the messaging that USC gave for students was that it is not USC’s responsibility to solve the homeless crisis,” Solis said. 
Solis also indicated that USC negotiators pit students against workers by tying increased wages for workers to increased tuition for students. 
“We know they have the money and it’s not dependent on students, and that’s just a tactic to scare us or to divide workers,” Solis said. 
Solis, as a part of SCALE, has organized events to support workers during the contract negotiations. The organization put together a workers’ appreciation lunch was Nov. 11. The event allowed students and faculty to express their gratitude to workers at USC and discuss how to collaborate in the future.
David Krieger, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering, has organized clipboarding campaigns to recruit more student activists to support workers during the negotiation period. 
“It’s been cool to see resoundingly that students, when they know what’s going on, they [know] this is an injustice,” Krieger said. 
Nathaniel Hyman, a junior majoring in public policy and law, has also mobilized different student groups, including Latinx Student Assembly, Trojans for Bernie and Trojan Advocates for Political Progress, to build a coalition advocating for workers.  
“I feel like [USC has] a moral obligation as one of the few institutions in California that is continuously prospering under very harsh conditions for low-income people,” Hyman said.  “I think it is their ethical responsibility to use some of that windfall to help the less fortunate people who are part of their institution.” 
Workers at other universities in California are protesting unfair treatment. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299, a University of California employee union, went on a one-day strike Nov. 13 to protest University outsourcing practices which prioritize lower-wage contractors outside of the union. AFSCME filed six unfair labor complaints against UC, claiming its outsourcing policies broke state laws and University rules. 
The Democratic National Committee relocated the sixth Democratic presidential primary debate from UCLA to Loyola Marymount University in support of the union’s struggles.
