Don’t be fooled — it was a great weekend at Dedeaux Field.
Baseball was finally back, and despite off-and-on showers, all six scheduled games of the USC baseball tournament were officially completed.
Though everything didn’t go as planned, the Trojans (2-1) managed to make the championship game, but fell short to North Carolina 11-7.
“They’re a top-20 program almost every year,” said junior third baseman Ricky Oropesa. “But we showed that we can hang with them.”
The Tar Heels (4-0) got on the board first with a pair of runs in the second. A perfectly executed hit-and-run put runners at the corners with one down, and right fielder Seth Baldwin delivered a bases-clearing triple off the wall in right-center field.
The Trojans left the bases loaded in the third, but again mounted a rally in the fourth. A single by junior center fielder Alex Sherrod, and a double over the head of Tar Heels center fielder Chaz Frank by senior second baseman Joe De Pinto put runners at second and third with no outs.
But junior designated hitter Brandon Garcia struck out and junior right fielder Mike Greco flied to center, meaning it was all up to freshman catcher Jake Hernandez, making his Trojan debut.
“It’s exciting,” Hernandez said. “It’s hard to keep your composure, but I felt good.”
And did he feel good — Hernandez promptly stepped up with a two-run double, and senior left fielder Matt Hart followed with a single through the left side, plating Hernandez and giving the Trojans a 3-2 lead.
But North Carolina came back with four runs in the second. A hit batsman, a pair of doubles and a single led to two runs and chased senior starting pitcher Logan Odam from the game.
With zero outs and runners at the corners, Cruz handed the ball to freshman lefty Kyle Richter for his Trojan debut.
“He has our uniform on,” Cruz said of Richter. “Everybody in our dugout that has our uniform on I’m gonna trust.”
Richter allowed the two runners to score, but settled down and got out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam with a strikeout and a flyout.
The Tar Heels tacked on another in the top of the sixth to make it 7-3, but in the bottom of the inning the Trojans came roaring back.
Singles by De Pinto, Garcia and Hernandez loaded the bases with one out. With two outs, freshman shortstop James Roberts was hit by a pitch to plate one, and up stepped the preseason all-American Oropesa.
“I’m not trying to hit a [home run] every at-bat,” Oropesa said. “I’m just trying to help the team out, get a double here and get some RBIs.”
With the bases juiced and the count full, Oropesa lined a bases clearing double down the right field line to tie the game at seven.
Carolina would push one run across in the seventh, but the number could have easily been more. With Tar Heels on second and third with two out, coach Cruz elected to walk switch-hitting shortstop Levi Michael to load the bases, and junior pitcher Chad Smith got Tar Heels catcher Jacob Stallings to ground to third to end the threat.
USC’s best chance to tie came in the eight, when they put runners at the corners with one out for Oropesa, who battled before finally striking out on a 3-2 curveball.
Junior first basemen Matt Foat momentarily electrified the crowd at Dedeaux Field by lofting a long ball that had all the looks of a go-ahead, three-run homer, but was ultimately caught on the warning track in right.
Carolina busted it open in the top of the ninth when second baseman Tommy Cole hit a two-run triple down the right field line and then proceeded to score on a wild pitch to give the Tar Heels their final 11-7 lead.
The Trojans went quietly in the bottom half of the inning to take their first loss of the season.
“The top of the ninth was a little deflating,” Cruz said. “But we’re not gonna let any situation get us down. We’re gonna keep competing and play the next pitch. And we did that all weekend.”
The Trojans certainly started the season on the right track by sweeping an opening day doubleheader against Missouri and Cal Poly Pomona.
Facing Missouri bright and early at 10 a.m., the Trojans struck first in the second, when De Pinto led off with a single to left. Sherrod then slapped a grounder that bounced off the glove of Tigers first baseman Dane Opel and over the fence for a ground rule double.  Greco knocked home the Trojans first run of the season with an RBI single to left. After sophomore right fielder Alex Glenn was hit by a pitch, junior leftfielder Garret Houts knocked in a pair with a single to right to give the Trojans a 3-0 lead.
USC added some padding with a pair of two-out runs in the fourth. Roberts walked and Houts reached on an infield single.  Then junior catcher Kevin Roundtree flied to center, but Mizzou center fielder Brannon Champagne dropped it, allowing two runs to score.
The Tigers got on the board with three RBI doubles in the fifth, knocking junior Trojan starter Andrew Triggs from the game after 4 2/3 innings pitched.  Senior pitcher Chirs Mezger came in and delivered one-and-one-third scoreless innings to earn the first win of the season for the Trojans.
USC added three more in the eighth and the bullpen combined for 4 1/3 scoreless innings to preserve the Trojans first victory of the season.
The late game against Cal Poly was far more interesting. As was joked in the press box after the game, you could credit Johnson with the loss, Wood with the win and rain with the save.
When the game was officially over, the scoreboard read 8-5 in favor of the Cal Poly Mustangs.  Officially, it will go in the books as a 5-2 USC win.
In the second game of a Saturday doubleheader, the Trojans lead 5-2 after five innings when the game was stopped for rain for the first time.  After 45 minutes the game resumed in the top of the sixth, and the Mustangs jumped all over the USC bullpen for six runs.  Before the Trojans could even get out of the inning, the rain started up again, and the tarp was brought back on.  When the game was stopped, Cal Poly led 8-5 with two out in the top of the sixth.  However, if the game could not be resumed, by rule the final score would revert back to the last completed inning — that was the fifth inning, after which the Trojans led 5-2.
They tried to play, however. The tarp was brought off, new dirt was poured, but the field was simply too wet to safely continue playing.  After much discussion between the two coaches and the umpires, the decision was made.  The game was called off, and the Trojans walked away with a rather unconventional 5-2 win to start off their season 2-0.
“They made the right decision,” Cruz said. “You don’t want somebody to get hurt out there.”
Of course, Cruz had a rather vested interest in the game being called, but said he wasn’t pushy about it.
“I tried to stay away from the umpires and just let them make their decision,” Cruz said. “I didn’t want to seem imposing, but remember we still had four at-bats left. That game was far from over.”
Junior transfer pitcher Austin Wood — a former fourth round draft pick of the Tampa Bay Rays — pitched all five innings that counted, giving up two earned and walking just one alongside eight strikeouts to earn his first win as a Trojan.
“It felt great,” Wood said. “My first time pitching out here, I was pretty excited the first few innings, but I settled down.”
Equipped with a mid-90’s heater, an 80 mph changeup and a sharp curve, the Mustangs were simply no match.
“Woody was great,” Sherrod said.  “He would blow it by people and then drop the velocity 15-20 miles per hour on them with the change.  And that’s not even mentioning the curve.  It was great to watch.”
USC struck for four in the first, all with two outs.  Sherrod got the rally started with a single to left, scoring Glenn from third and moving Foat up to second. De Pinto followed with another single scoring Foat, and Roundtree loaded the bases with an infield single. Garcia then came through with the bases loaded knock, plating Sherrod and De Pinto.
Cal Poly got back two in the third with a pair of two out RBI singles by J.J. Thompson and Bobby Crocker.  With runners at the corners the Mustangs were threatening a big inning, but Wood induced Mike Miller into a groundout.  After that, Wood settled into a real grove. He allowed just one base runner over the final three innings and struck out the side in the fifth.
By contrast, the Trojans threatened every inning, but could only manage to push one more across. With one out in the bottom of the third, Oropesa slammed a ball off the base of the wall in right-center.  He advanced to third on a Foat single and scored on Sherrod’s sacrifice fly to center.
However, runners stranded were a problem for the Trojans throughout the weekend.  They left 10 on against Carolina, and two on in each of the first four innings against Cal Poly, as well as one in the fifth.  Against Missouri, they left at least one on in seven of their eight innings, including the bases loaded in the seventh.
“It’s a bittersweet stat,” Cruz said. “Because it means you’re getting runners on.  But obviously the goal is to get them in as well. We just gotta trust the guy behind you, because you can’t get them all in at once.”
With the Trojans off to a good start, Oropesa believes the team did well, but there is still room for growth.
“Overall, a successful weekend, he said. “We competed and we just gotta keep working hard.”
The Trojans travel inland to take on UC Riverside on Tuesday, and will spend next weekend in Houston visiting No. 15 Rice.

F. Scott Fitzgerald’s iconic novel on the lavish lifestyle of the roaring twenties has previously been adapted on the big screen with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow as the stars, but Baz Luhrmann’s adaptation of The Great Gatsby will be in mind-boggling 3D.
Yes, this means we will be able to see Daisy driving Gatsby’s sports car right at us. The puzzling choice of 3D leaves us to believe that maybe Luhrmann has a different, more action-packed version of the classic.
The Hollywood Reporter recently confirmed another first. The Great Gatsby will be shooting in Sydney this August, not in the original setting of New York City.  Not surprisingly, Luhrmann is also Australian and was the director of the epic historical romance, Australia.  The choice of location though is also a business deal.  The film will inject $118 million into the New South Wales Economy due to the employment of over 800 people.
But do not fear.  All is not lost.  Oscar-nominated Leonardo DiCaprio will star as the wealthy and mysterious Jay Gatsby, while Carey Mulligan will play the beautiful and spoiled Daisy Buchanan.  Toby McGuire is also rumored to be playing the story’s narrator, Nick Carraway.
Either Fitzgerald is rolling over in his grave at the liberties Luhrmann has taken, or Luhrmann is a visionary artist.

First, Bruno Mars and Janelle Monae collaborated together with B.o.B. for a fun GRAMMY Awards performance, and now they’re preparing for a tour together.
The tour will be co-headlined by Mars and Monae along with a few appearances by Plan B and Mayer Hawthorne on select dates. The dates for the North American Hooligans in Wondaland Tour were announced yesterday with a retro poster that complements the classic style the two represent.  
With an abundance of hit songs last year, Mars is already off to a great start for 2011. It’s only the second month of the year and he has already had seven GRAMMY nominations and a GRAMMY win for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for his song, “Just The Way You Are.”
Before going on tour, he will be filming a music video for his tune, “The Lazy Song,” somewhere in Los Angeles. The video’s release date has not been announced. With lyrics like “Today I don’t feel like doing anything/I just wanna lay in my bed,” most students will be able to relate since the end of the school year will either be quickly approaching or have arrived when the video is released.
The public sale for tickets starts on Feb. 26.

After a few years, Adele’s highly anticipated sophomore album 21 will be released Feb. 22.  An exciting North American tour is set to accompany this new release beginning May 12 in Washington D.C. and ending in Nashville on June 20. Luckily for Southern California natives, this lovely, classy and alternative Brit, who is influenced by Etta James and The Cure, will be performing on June 9 at the Wiltern.
Her most recent single, “Rolling in the Deep,” is sure to entice fans and new listeners alike. It’s a catchy and contagious number sung with her alluring, soulful and impassioned voice.  This upbeat and addictive song has already been featured in the recently released I Am Number Four and has become an immediate on-air success.
One might think it would be a difficult task at hand to follow up her debut album 19 given that it contained  a distinctive blend of melancholic harmonies mixed with her mellow jazz-infused aura.  But based off  her new single, Adele is more than likely to do it again.
From what listeners have heard, it seems as though Adele maintains her signature voice with a  mature vibe and a clear sense of who she is as a performer.

According to TheHollywoodReporter.com, preliminary box office results show a 30% decrease from last year’s President Day Weekend. Though the reasons are unclear as to why, the performers this weekend seem to go against expectations.
At number one with an estimated $21 million was the Liam Neeson thriller Unknown followed by the much buzzed about teen sci-fi I Am Number Four at a modest $19 million and the animated comedy Gnomeo & Juliet coming in also with $19 million.
Unknown follows in Neeson’s last international thriller, Taken, which was released last January to a robust box office success.
I  Am Number Four, which attempted to gain the audiences for movies like Harry Potter and Twilight, failed to garner the kind of mass hysteria among tweens, despite a production budget of a hefty $60 million and the backing of superstar producer Michael Bay. The film was also released in IMAX theaters and distributed by Buena Vista.

The USC men’s tennis team proved they were only human this weekend, as they came home with consecutive losses since 2008.
Making the trip to Seattle for the ITA National Indoors Championship was a slightly makeshift lineup, as senior Peter Lucassen stayed back due to injury, and was replaced by sophomore Corey Smith.
Even during the weekend’s matches, the Trojans (8-2) couldn’t manage to leave with all their players healthy.
Freshman Ray Sarmiento had to pull out against Duke’s Fred Saba after being down 6-4, 4-2, because of injury.
“He’s had a bad shoulder and he hasn’t really taken proper care of it,” said USC coach Peter Smith. “It spread to his elbow and wrist, and right now it’s his wrist, so he’s playing catch up. He’s got to get better.”
Despite not being at full strength and walking away empty-handed at the tournament, the coaching staff is confident the team will be fine once everybody is healthy.
“We proved that we are missing one-third of our starting lineup, and we were one point away from being in the semifinals of the tournament — to me, that’s a great sign for the team,” Smith said. “Duke was in the semifinals, and so you have to think that when we get our team right, we’ll be right there.”
In its first matchup, No. 2 USC got edged by No. 15 Duke 4-3, and the Blue Devils proved to once again be a thorn in the team’s backside.
With Sarmiento out, the doubles lineup shifted to junior Daniel Nguyen and freshman Emilio Gomez at the No. 1 spot, sophomore J.T. Sundling and senior Jaak Poldma at No. 2 and junior Steve Johnson and freshman Michael Grant at No. 3.
The second day didn’t prove to be any easier as USC lost 4-3 — this time, it was to a fellow Pac-10 team in No. 7 Stanford.
Still, USC bounced back to win decisively, 4-0 against No. 12 Louisville in its last match.
“We fought hard against Duke and Stanford, and it’s early in the season but it’s kind of a good test to see how we can do,” Johnson said. “After losing twice 4-3, to come back the third day, show some resiliency, come back and win decisively is big.”
Losing isn’t something the Trojans are used to, but it is something that the team can grow from.
“I don’t like to lose,” Smith said. “[But] if losing is progressing, then that’s okay. We’re better off having played these matches, win or lose.”
Doubles play was looking stronger for USC this weekend, as the team won two of three of its matches against Duke and Stanford, and went on to sweep Louisville.
“[Poldma] and [Sundling] really had a great weekend,” Smith said. “They played really well and you’ve got to make do when you have fewer people.”
The Trojans come home for the week to host Cal and Stanford on Friday and Saturday at  Marks Stadium.
“We knew this was going to be a tough tournament playing the top 16 teams,” Johnson said. “[It’ll] be good to play a new team, get ready and have a big rematch against Stanford. [We] definitely don’t want to lose to them again, especially on our home courts, so we’ll come out and be ready to play.”
The tennis team has lost consecutively since 2008? What happened to defending national champions? Proofreading would have been nice here…
