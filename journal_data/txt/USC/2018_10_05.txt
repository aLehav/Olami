An estimated 1,200 guests filled Bovard Auditorium to listen to conservative commentator Ben Shapiro Thursday evening. Despite protests outside the venue, the event by Young Americans for Freedom faced no disruptions.
YAF Chairman Maxwell Brandon delivered opening remarks, welcoming Shapiro to USC and thanking security staff at the event. 
As Shapiro made his way to the podium, some audience members erupted into applause and chanted, “U.S.A! U.S.A!,” while others shouted, “Shapiro for President.”
Shapiro began his talk by addressing the protestors outside of the event.
“A lot of Trojans don’t necessarily have a soft spot for me,” Shapiro said. “I was noticing some folks chanting outside. Apparently I’m a racist, a bigot and a homophobe … I’m also a neo-Nazi, which makes the yarmulke real weird. All this is sheer nonsense and garbage — I’m happy to respond to any such accusations.” 
While Shapiro took issue with how the protestors characterized him, he welcomed their presence.
Shapiro also noted that prominent left-wing figures such as feminist writer Gloria Steinem, former U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and political activist Angela Davis had previously been guests at the University.
“I’m apparently a lot more controversial than Angela Davis, who is an actual Stalinist,” Shapiro said. “Angela Davis is welcome on this campus, but it takes a hell of a lot more to get me here.” 
While Davis has stated that she is a communist, she has never explicitly stated that she is a Stalinist. 
Shapiro’s main point centered on the importance of constitutional freedoms and how he believes they are currently under assault. According to him, freedom is threatened by advocates of identity politics, who believe that collective social justice overrides individual justice. 
“Negative rights are rights that you have from the intervention of others; positive rights are rights you have from the goods and services of others,” Shapiro said. “The problem, you see, with positive rights, is that they are not self-fulfilling. The United States is based on negative rights … the U.S. Constitution is based on negative rights.”
Shapiro also championed the idea of individual liberty and the threat of the imposition of certain rights restrictions. He cited the case of state courts mandating bakeries to make cakes for same-sex weddings, calling the directive a violation of fundamental freedoms.
“Just because you don’t agree with someone doesn’t mean you have the right to oppress them,” Shapiro said. 
Shapiro also argued that the easiest way to restrict freedom of speech is by labeling it as hate speech. He then praised USC for allowing the event to take place, stating that the University “did the right thing.” 
Although Shapiro agreed that some speech is objectively hateful, such as the use of the N-word, he clarified that he doesn’t want the government to determine what speech can and cannot be expressed. 
He mentioned the recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearings involving Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the judge of sexual assault. Shapiro urged the audience to acknowledge that Kavanaugh is entitled to a presumption of innocence and due process of law.
“When [President Donald] Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh, I was lukewarm at best. But now, I want [him] enshrined on the Supreme Court,” Shapiro said, to which audience members responded with applause. 
Shapiro also mentioned a recent campus controversy surrounding Sol Price School of Public Policy Professor James Moore, who sent an email reply to Price students last Thursday stating “accusers sometimes lie.” The response was sent to the entire Price school. Shapiro criticized the subsequent student-led protest calling for Moore’s resignation. 
Following Shapiro’s speech, nine attendees asked him questions. Those who disagreed with the speaker were invited to line up first; however, many who asked questions sided with Shapiro. Questions ranged from Shapiro’s stance on the transgender community to the existence of a deity.
One student challenged Shapiro’s notion of free speech, claiming that some of his speech incited violence.
“Well you heard my speech tonight. Do you feel like my speech can incite violence?” Shapiro asked. “If I’m not telling someone to commit violence, I’m not inciting them to violence.”
The commentator was also questioned on his stance on transgender individuals. In the past, Shapiro has called being transgender a mental illness, despite the World Health Organization’s decision to no longer call it such. 
“The trans community is trying to purvey that people’s sex is malleable … I fundamentally disagree with that point,” Shapiro said. “Is everyone in the United States entitled to the same rights? Of course. But your right does not extend to forcing me to call you what you want me to call you … That violates my freedom of speech.” 
Following the event, YAF Chairman Brandon called the event a success in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
“Conservatives on campus were able to find out that there are other people that think like them, not just a handful,” Brandon said. “I think we also achieved the discussion we were going for.”
Shapiro is set to speak at the University at Buffalo on Oct. 8 for the next stop of his college tour.

The “Say NO to Shapiro!” rally took place in Hahn Plaza Thursday afternoon in response to a speaking event featuring conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The chant “racist, fascist, anti-gay, Ben Shapiro go away,” rang through Hahn Plaza Thursday as nearly 250 students and community members protested the conservative speaker at Tommy Trojan.
After a week of outcry from cultural assemblies and other organizations, protesters held banners and signs stating “No to Shapiro. No to bigotry” as they denounced his speech at Bovard Auditorium, calling his views discriminatory and labeling them as hate speech. 
Aubtin Heydari, who was injured at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va. last year while counter-protesting, was among the speakers.
“Shapiro’s bread and butter is picking on college students,” Heydari said. “[He avoids] any situation where someone can substantially respond to him in a manner remotely similar to the discussion of idea that he and the other alt-right commentators insist they desire.”
 Several cultural assembly leaders stood at Tommy Trojan, quoting statements that Shapiro previously made, calling out what they deemed racism and transphobia. Event organizer Kameron Hurt, a leader from Students for Justice in Palestine, Native American Student Union student leader Mato Standing Soldier and Black Student Assembly assistant director Mae Gates also spoke. 
The protest was interrupted toward the beginning by a few interjections, causing community service officers to call into the crowd for protesters to “keep it civil.” One protester called out, “You’re a fucking liar” while another called out “Give it up for Israel” at the protesters, prompting them to chant “racists go home.”
In addition to students, the Rev. Dr. Sunny Kang from United University Church addressed the crowd, saying Shapiro’s message was not in the Bible, despite people associating his messages with Christian values. Kang said the Bible stands for justice and what is right.
“They’re asking you to dumb down and you need to stand up and say that this is an academic institution,” he said. “Ignorance has no place [here].”
Shapiro addressed the protesters in a video on Young American Freedom’s Twitter page.
“We got a couple hundred protesters outside, doing what they usually do, spending a weeknight making trouble, being who they are, exercising their First Amendment rights, that’s great,” Shapiro said.
Once the event began, Hurt led protestors past Bovard Auditorium to USC Village with the intention of making the rest of campus aware their reason for protest. They chanted “cops and the Klan go hand in hand” as they passed the line of people waiting on standby to enter the event.
The rally was sponsored by 17 campus organizations, including SJP, Latinx Student Assembly and the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment.
“I think we achieved our mission … to bring awareness to the issues that this University is ignoring,” Hurt told the Daily Trojan. “Our mission was to show that there is an active resistance that will not stand for hate speech. And it was to show people’s power and we did that.”
The protest did not receive much visible opposition from those in support of Shapiro on campus. 
“It’s cool that they have their beliefs and you can respect that,” said Cole Cirillo, a junior majoring in business administration and political science, who attended the Shapiro event. “Obviously, I think that they’re out of line and that it’s a little irrational … But it’s what they believe and they have the right to be out here.”
Young Americans for Freedom at USC spent $1,000 to create a designated area for protest during the event; however, protestors rallied near Tommy Trojan and in front of Bovard Auditorium instead. Some student leaders said YAF never informed them about the space.
“[The protest going well was a] big relief,” YAF Chairman Maxwell Brandon said after the event. “[We were] wondering what the fallout would be depending on how bad it was, but I’m really happy it turned out so civilly and people were able to sit down and listen.” 
After controversy surrounding student ticket cancellations for leaders of student assemblies, Brandon told the Daily Trojan that he had allowed some of those students to enter the event. However, various leaders from LSA, BSA and SAGE said they had not been contacted by Brandon or leaders from YAF and did not attend the event.
“They communicate with y’all more than us,” an LSA leader Eloisa Campuzano told the Daily Trojan.
Nearly 30 uniformed police officers were stationed around Bovard and throughout Trousdale Parkway, according to DPS. Protest organizers also had trained “de-escalators” who were meant to manage the crowd to keep the event peaceful. They stood around the active protesters in yellow bandanas, holding signs and facing outward toward nearby spectators, some of whom were participating, while others observed.
USG President Debbie Lee and Vice President Blake Ackerman were pleased to see student activism on campus, but said student safety was their top priority. 
“It’s inspiring to see student activism on this campus,” Ackerman said. “It’s something in our three years here we’ve looked to see, we haven’t seen as much before. [But] I think that students recognizing their right to free exercise is beautiful.”
The protest ended before 7:30 p.m. by Hecuba at USC Village without any reported incidences of violence from protesters or event attendees.

Yasmin Davis | Daily Trojan
On Sept. 16, the Department of Public Safety began issuing citations to students caught violating USC Village’s bike ban. While the policy banning bikes, skateboards and roller skates is as old as USC Village itself, its full implementation only began last month, causing student confusion.
DPS stated that its intent for enforcing the bike ban was to create a safer environment for guests in USC Village, citing multiple complaints of “close call” collisions. Traffic congestion remains a campus fixture even after a decade of community dialogue efforts, and the University should continue to take steps to address it. The bike ban, however, is misguided on so many counts that it ought to be overturned altogether.
For one, USC Village’s bike ban has caused a disparity in police presence between the area and the rest of campus. USC Village has up to six scooter-mounted officers on patrol at any given time, but Trousdale Parkway has no stationary officers to monitor the traffic hotspot there. Even the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, where another bike ban is in effect, is devoid of regular patrols. 
The bike ban forces DPS to prioritize USC Village despite its personnel shortage, which means that the majority of bikes — and thus potential traffic accidents — are not being supervised. This is inherently counterproductive, especially for an organization which claims that its primary mission is to “provide a safe and secure environment on campus and in the local USC community.”
In addition, the bike ban was not communicated nearly as well as it could have been. While officers did hand out flyers and put up A-frame signs in the area’s central courtyard, awareness of this regulation is contained to the quad. DPS has not yet informed the entire school via email or text message, and as long as it does not do so, confusion will remain.
It’s strange how DPS came to the conclusion that bike safety means no bikes, as the popularity of bicycles and personal transportation vehicles among students is a documented phenomenon. In 2012, USC News reported that roughly 10,000 students rode bicycles on the University Park campus, and that number has likely grown since then. Bicycling is a key mode of transport for USC students, it is absurd that University policies do not account for the possibility that some of those bicycles would attempt to access USC Village.
The only rational conclusion is that this particular ban is primarily intended to serve guests, not students, who are the most important stakeholders in USC’s welfare. In the words of DPS training coordinator Michelle Velasco, “We’re trying to create that safe environment for all the guests of the Village in that quad area, because of all the restaurants and businesses and people out there.” 
These remarks from a Daily Trojan article on Sept. 12 are especially revealing, as the University places guests and retail employees first and foremost, only mentioning students as parties targeted by this rule. The bike ban is yet another regulation maneuver to make USC Village feel more exclusive.
Instead of banning personal transportation, DPS ought to account for its usage. A useful compromise between safety and accessibility would be the creation of bike lanes. While their effectiveness on Trousdale is questionable, USC Village’s smaller size and intersections make it uniquely suitable for designated biking areas. DPS can also ensure bike safety by including mandatory bike safety courses for incoming students. It also needs to continue encouraging pedestrians to be alert and not glued to their phones.
Bikes and other personal transportation vehicles have always been a part of campus life and will remain so as long as people need to go places quickly. The University must recognize this and revise its policy at USC Village to reflect this reality.

Text and blank spaces cover the walls of Subliminal Projects gallery. It’s not an essay, it’s art. The art space has partnered with Faction Art Projects in New York to curate “Visual Language,” a bicoastal show focused on text and typography in art. The exhibitions comprise the same artists — including Ed Ruscha, Jenny Holzer and Chad Kouri — but display different artwork.
“Visual Language” exhibits diverse works ranging from Shepard Fairey’s black and white text piece forming a haunting face underlined by the word “OBEY” to feminist art collective Guerrilla Girls’ straightforward use of bold-lettered text to oppose patriarchal influence of wealth and power on the art world.
Sarah Kaplan, associate director of Subliminal Projects and co-curator of “Visual Language,” expressed the versatility of text in artistic messaging.
“Whether it be ironic, political, abstract, there are different ways text is used in art, and we wanted to express all those different avenues,” Kaplan said.
The Guerrilla Girls took a more humorous approach to address political issues within the art world. Each member of the activist group is anonymous in order to draw focus to the issues at hand rather than their own identities and takes the name of a dead female artist. Käthe Kollwitz, a member who has adopted the moniker of the late German artist, emphasized the importance of making a statement with the politics of art. 
“You can’t just point at something you dislike and say, ‘This is bad!’ You have to do more. You have to twist your message, to say it in an unforgettable way. We’ve found that humor is a very powerful tool. If you can make someone who disagrees with you laugh, you have a hook into their brain, and your message stays there and haunts them,” Kollwitz said in an email interview with the Daily Trojan. 
 
The gallery showcases two pieces of work by the Guerrilla Girls, “Wealth & Power” and “The 3 Ways to Write a Wall Label When the Artist is a Sexual Predator,” displayed side by side and linked by the identical orange shade used in the backgrounds.
The first piece consists of a striking image of a large group of women, emulating the Guerrilla Girls, covering their faces with gorilla masks. Above this image is black, block-lettered text followed by the yellow, handwritten words, “Wealth & Power.” The words speak out against the bias and unfair representation of artists in museums. 
The second piece is a simple poster that relates to the message of the first. In striking, bold text are the words “3 Ways to Write a Museum Wall Label When the Artist is a Sexual Predator.” Underneath, they demonstrate how to write wall labels for three different categories of museums: “For museums afraid of alienating billionaire trustees and collectors who donated the artist’s work,” “For museums conflicted about disclosing an artist’s abuse next to his art” and “For museums who need help from the Guerrilla Girls.” The progression of the wall labels went from praising the artist and his work in the first column to blatantly showcasing his history of sexual abuse in the last column. .
“The world of artists is great, but the art system today sucks. Museums are trying to be more diverse, but super-rich collectors with their cookie cutter collections of the same (mostly white male) expensive artists are making it difficult,” Kollwitz said. 
“We say: Don’t let museums reduce art to the small number of artists who have won a popularity contest among bigtime dealers, curators and collectors. Unless museums show art as diverse as the cultures they represent, they’re not showing the history of art, they’re just telling the story of wealth and power.”
Feminist artist Betty Tompkins took a more concise approach to using text, separating singular words or phrases on blocks and tiles. These words are part of a series of a thousand words that are commonly used to describe women, including “bitch,” “slut” and “mother.”
“What she did is she emailed her entire contact base and asked them to send her words or phrases or adjectives about women,” Kaplan said.
Of the 3,500 responses she received, Tompkins chose 1,000 of those words to paint. Each tile is unique, consisting of different words and backgrounds. Tompkins makes references in her backgrounds to the artists she calls “Old Boy Champion Painters,” alluding to Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning in her work. 
“Each piece is available individually, but she installs them in different spaces in this way so this is a selection of that series, and I think it’s really powerful,” Kaplan said.
The “Visual Language” exhibition ends Oct. 6. Subliminal Project has open gallery hours Wednesday through Saturday from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. and is available on Tuesdays by appointment only.

As protesters denounced Ben Shapiro’s hateful rhetoric on campus Thursday, I could only think of one thing: What would my mom say about it?
She’d probably say, “Que Dios le ablande el corazón.” (May God soften his heart.) 
It seems to be her go-to phrase for these types of situations.
She understands that words — especially the kind that Shapiro spews on a daily basis — hurt people. She knows that words leave marks, and she understands how important and impactful they can be.
For me, the words “This is America. Speak English” still ring fresh in my mind from when the quarterback of my high school, Jake, asked my cousin and I to stop speaking Spanish — on Cinco de Mayo no less. Jake, in his camouflage cap and cargo shorts, approached mi prima and I for no apparent reason and all we could do was look up and say, “Excuse me?” 
He repeated himself: “This is America. Speak English.” 
I wasn’t over it then and I am still not over it. If it happens again, I will throw hands, because simply speaking in my native tongue in public is a form of resistance to those who oppose the presence of my parents in this country. 
Unlike my mom, I become upset and react quickly. But enough about me. 
If anyone knows what it means to face hate speech, it’s my mom. She’s an undocumented, Mexican domestic worker living in the United States. By all accounts, she’s low on the hierarchy of people who matter in America.
For people like conservative political pundits Milo Yiannopoulos, Ann Coulter, Tomi Lahren, Shapiro, President Donald Trump and quarterback Jake to name a few, she is simply “an illegal.” She is reduced to one of the 11 million “illegal aliens” living in this country.
Despite the dehumanizing words these people say about her, my mom would reply, “Que Dios los bendiga.” (May God bless them.) She shows no resentment or hatred toward them, and she simply wishes the best for esos racistas.
I can say this with certainty because I heard her say exactly that after an orange-haired man in a black suit stood in front of a crowd and announced he wanted to be president. Oh, and he also said that Mexicans are criminals and rapists and that maybe — just maybe — some were good people.
I know that she’d tell me, “déjalo,” (let it go) if I complained about Shapiro because it’s what she said tearfully when a department store employee humiliated her and told her, with a demeaning smirk, “I can’t verify that this ID is valid.” Nobody gets ID’d when making a return.
“Ni modo, no pasa nada,” (It’s whatever, nothing’s wrong) is another a common phrase of hers. She said it while sobbing after she came home from an interview for a nanny position, when she was asked a question she feared every time she spoke to a potential employer: “Are you a citizen?” 
My mom panicked, told the truth about her status and was told, “You’d be perfect for our children, but we can’t hire you if you’re not legal.” 
I don’t just say this because she’s my mom, but if there is one woman qualified to care for a child, it’s my mom. She’s been caring for children — some whom I often felt jealous of because they saw her more than I did — for over 20 years. Mi mamá raises the kids she cares for as if they were her own. And while some call her “Nina” since it’s short for her name, Carolina, others call her mami.
Through it all, my mom has never wished harm upon hateful people and I admire her for that. Perhaps that’s what makes her such a great nanny — she only gives love. (I swear I was only threatened with la chancla once, and I deserved it too.)
My mom has never said that she hates Trump, and she definitely wouldn’t say she hates Shapiro. She’d watch people protest, and pray that no violence occurs. If there’s anyone who deserves to be angry at this country and her circumstances, it’s my Latina mother — but she’s not. She’s level-headed and kind, even if all of the odds are against her.
 She’d listen to Shapiro’s speech, grimace and repeat “que Dios lo ayude.”
Shapiro may have left campus, but the students who agree with his stances and attended Thursday’s event are still here. Some of them may not agree with my parents’ decision to migrate here without papers or with immigrants speaking Spanish in public, but, taking after my mom, I’m not going to hate them for that.

On Wednesday, professors Josh Kun (left) and Viet Thanh Nguyen (right) sat down to discuss important topics such as their respective experiences in academia. (Hyeonmi Shin | Daily Trojan)
Professors Viet Thanh Nguyen and Josh Kun conversed with colleagues, board members and a handful of students about their respective experiences in the world of academia.
The event was co-sponsored by “Race, Arts and Placemaking,” a collaborative project supported by the USC Provost Research Collaboration Fund, of which Nguyen and Kun are both members Wednesday at the University Club.
Nguyen is a Pulitzer Prize-winning Vietnamese American novelist, known for his 2015 book “The Sympathizer.” Professionally, Nguyen primarily focuses on the experience of Vietnamese refugees and their navigation through American culture and politics. As a Vietnamese refugee himself, Nguyen’s work is very personal.
Kun, a MacArthur Fellow, is regarded for his critiques of popular music in an academic format. Kun studies music’s relationship with power and identity, particularly in relation to race and ethnicity.
Nguyen and Kun’s conversation covered a wide range of topics, chiefly their shared beliefs on ethnic studies, and how the two navigate the world of academia with strong interdisciplinary interests and refugees.
Establishing their shared passion for ethnic studies, Nguyen stated that both he and Kun got their starts in ethnic studies, a genealogy that he thinks has substantially informed the work they do today.
According to Nguyen, ethnic studies started picking up around the 1960s. Although decades have passed since this starting point, Kun states that the discipline is a history that has maintained its urgency over the years, a sentiment that Nguyen agrees with. Ethnic studies, to both men, is essential to our understanding of the cultural and political world we live in.
“It is really hard to write about popular music without foregrounding issues of identity and specific liaisons of racism, especially in this U.S. context,” Kun said.
After discussing their accomplished careers to date, the conversation turned toward the topic of refugees.
“It is increasingly urgent to address refugees as a local, a national, a global phenomenon because the problem is not going to go away,” Nguyen said.
Through their respective independent research, Nguyen and Kun have discovered that refugees are exceedingly ill-disposed to identifying or being labeled as such. In his work with Syrian refugees in Berlin, Kun recalled that people who he conversed with said, “We will only talk to you if you agree to refuse that category with us.”
Similarly, while talking to high school students at a public school that has a refugee program in Boise, Idaho, Nguyen found that students were more prone to identify as immigrants than  refugees.
“There is a stigma attached to being a refugee, even if there are benefits attached to it as well,” Nguyen said.
Despite the wide range of  topics covered during the hour, Nguyen and Kun’s conversation ended on a friendly note. Kun fittingly gifted Nguyen a vinyl record from The Refugees, a band comprising Vietnamese refugees.

At Tuesday’s panel, professors Rod Gilfry, Lynn Helding and Karla O’Dell taught Thornton musicians mindfulness and muscle relaxation techniques to help curb performance anxiety. (Dimple Sarnaaik | Daily Trojan)
Nausea, uncontrollable shaking, sweating and dry mouth. While on the severe side, these symptoms are all hallmarks of music performance anxiety, an issue that plagues both student and professional musicians. 
For instrumentalists, symptoms like shaking and sweating can lead to poor finger control, while dry mouth can cause vocalists and woodwind players to falter, said Lynn Helding, a professor of practice in vocal arts and coordinator of vocology and voice pedagogy. Thankfully, she said, students nearly always rise to the occasion, and simple techniques such as being prepared and repeating a mantra while on stage have remarkable preventative effects. 
As part of the Thornton School of Music’s “Musician’s Wellness” initiative, Helding and other faculty members gathered Tuesday night to discuss coping techniques for music performance anxiety, as well as the ailment itself. 
“What I tell [students] is just to think about something like the words: ‘Thank you,’” Helding said. “That always would work for me: I would bow and say to myself ‘I’m so grateful, I’m so grateful, I’m so grateful.’”
Music performance anxiety affects musicians at all skill levels. Rod Gilfry, an associate professor in vocal arts and opera, shared his personal experience dealing with performance anxiety as a professional opera singer Tuesday night. 
Gilfry said one of the defining characteristics of his performance anxiety is the feeling of fear itself. When the anxiety sets in at the same place in the music, day after day, a feeling of trepidation creeps in, and thereby intensifies the feeling, he said. 
“I can tell you now objectively that the audience wants you do well,” Gilfry said. “It’s the experience of your fear that’s the biggest problem.”
For a while, Gilfry self-medicated with a beer before performances and sometimes snuck out for another during intermission, a technique he said worked surprisingly well. However, Gilfry added the caveat that drinking to avoid anxiety can be a slippery slope, as people often buy into the fallacy that additional drinks will lead to additional relief. 
Other techniques that ultimately helped Gilfry include gazing at a neutral point on the wall and trying to make it burst into flames, as well as repeating a simple mantra. Prior to a performance of “The Barber of Seville,” Gilfry said he suddenly lost his voice, which drinking beer did not ameliorate. He ultimately enlisted the aid of a voice coach, who simply told Gilfry to repeat the phrase “I am calm” aloud with meaning. With each iteration of the mantra, Gilfry said his hoarseness gradually faded, giving way to his normal baritone voice. 
Helding emphasized that although mindfulness and relaxation techniques are helpful, coming into a performance prepared is likely the best way to avoid music performance anxiety.
On the  medical side, treatment for music performance anxiety include beta blockers as well as muscle relaxation techniques for vocalists, said Karla O’Dell, an assistant professor of clinical otolaryngology at the Keck School of Medicine. O’Dell said anxiety during vocal performances may lead to increased muscle tension, which can result in throat pain, soreness or a change in the voice.
“If it gets to the point that performance anxiety is preventing you from performing to [the level] you think you can perform, then thats a reason to seek out medication or cognitive behavioral therapy,” O’Dell said. 
Students in attendance said they suffered from performance anxiety at some point in their careers. Emily Thebaut, a doctoral student in vocal performance who attended the event, said performing for peers causes her more anxiety than playing in front of a receptive audience. 
Thebaut said her performance anxiety induces difficulty breathing and cottonmouth and is exacerbated by high-stakes situations. However, she’s grateful that Thornton is addressing music performance anxiety, and that people like Professor Gilfry are willing to share their stories. 
“It’s very humbling to see people who have had really impressive careers and are confronting [performance anxiety],” Thebaut said. “They’re making it more approachable.”

Sophomore running back Stephen Carr has recorded 276 yards this season, averaging 5.9 yards per carry. (Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan)
Heading into their bye week, the Trojans find themselves at a crossroads, coming off a less-than-impressive start to the year. After comfortably winning against UNLV in the season opener, the Trojans dropped their next two games on the road. Struggling to conjure any sort of offense, USC lost to Stanford 17-3, before blowing an 11-point lead and allowing Texas to score 34 unanswered to put the team at 1-2. 
USC picked up a hard fought win at the Coliseum the next week against a then-undefeated Washington State team, and barely eked out a victory against Arizona last Saturday after committing 18 penalties to find themselves where they are now: 3-2 and unranked.
It’s hard to pin down exactly what this team is; USC’s strengths and weaknesses seem to change with every game. This bye week presents the team with the opportunity to figure out its identity and doing so will require the Trojans to see what’s worked for them and what hasn’t.
Offense
The Trojan offense started the year with a rash of inconsistent performances. After a dominant performance against UNLV that saw the team post nearly 500 yards of total offense, the unit sputtered against Stanford and Texas. The offensive line’s poor play played a big part in those losses, as it struggled to find consistency in both pass protection and run blocking. The group allowed seven sacks between the two games, and its sub-par performances in the ground game were evidenced by average yards per carry of 3.1 and minus-0.3 respectively. Freshman quarterback JT Daniels had a tough time finding a rhythm during that stretch, throwing no touchdown passes but three interceptions. 
The offense seems to have found its stride since, putting up big numbers against Washington State and Arizona. The offensive line turned in much better performances, helping the other parts of the offense step up as well. The ground game has looked impressive, with the three headed monster of running backs senior Aca’Cedric Ware, sophomore Stephen Carr and redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai rushing for 168, 157 and 86 yards, respectively, over the past two weeks, along with five touchdowns between them. 
The passing game has taken off as well, with Daniels having played his two best games of the season to the tune of 438 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions while completing 66 percent of his passes. Freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown has been the most dominant force at receiver for the Trojans, with 25 receptions for 396 yards on the year to go with two touchdowns. Receivers junior Michael Pittman and redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns have stepped up lately as well, with a combined 34 catches on the season. 
Defense
The trajectory of USC’s defense has seemingly been the opposite. The unit was expected to be the strength of the team coming into the season, and it looked to be that way after they largely contained UNLV and held a potent Stanford offense to only 17 points in a losing effort. However, it’s been a completely different story since. The Trojans have given up 37, 36 and 20 points in their last three games, and find themselves ranked 69th in the nation in total defense, giving up an average of 381 yards per game. The team has had trouble generating any pass rush, with only nine sacks on the year, and five of those coming in the opener against UNLV. 
The play of the secondary has been up and down, with a revolving door at left cornerback where three different players have been rotating, and inconsistent play from veterans like redshirt senior cornerback Ajene Harris and senior safety Marvell Tell. Freshman safety Talanoa Hufanga has been a bright spot on the unit, with impressive play since being forced to step into a starting role against Washington State. Senior linebacker Cameron Smith has been a force in the middle with 47 tackles so far, along with three passes deflected. 
USC will leave its bye week in a precarious position. With the remainder of the season coming, the Trojans  still have a strong chance of winning the Pac-12 South and play in the conference championship. Their contest against Colorado off the bye could either kill their hopes of reaching the Pac-12 title game, or could place them in good position to do just that. It’ll take consistency from the offensive line, the emergence of a pass rush and discipline on both sides of the ball for USC to be truly formidable.

Junior driver Marin Dasic has scored 21 goals this season after scoring 29 last season. He earned NCAA All-Tournament team and All-MPSF Honorable Mention as a freshman. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
After a sweep of all five matchups last weekend, No. 1 USC looks to boost its record to 18-0 as it travels to Palo Alto to face No. 3 Stanford on Saturday.
Sophomore drivers Marco Vavic and Jacob Mercep lead the team in scoring with 39 and 31 goals, respectively. Freshman goalies Nic Porter and Sam Krutong anchor the defense with 50 and 47 saves, respectively.
The Cardinal enter the game also undefeated with an 8-0 record, their best start to the season since 2015. Five of those victories have been over nationally-ranked teams, making them USC’s highest-ranked opponent so far in 2018. The Trojans have won eight straight games over Stanford.
“It’ll be a bit of a daunting experience for some of the new guys on the team,” Porter said. “It’s going to be very exciting for us and we’ll do our best to make sure that … the younger guys are more than up to the task. We’ll get a win on the road.”
After heavy conditioning last week in training for a five-game weekend, head coach Jovan Vavic has been focusing on tactical work to prepare for the Stanford match.
The Trojans are looking to continue to work on building a cohesive dynamic on Saturday, a priority this season given so many young players on the roster. 
“We’re coming up against a strong group of players at Stanford, and we’re going to have to match that and be better,” Porter said. “There’s not really one thing in particular we’re looking to work on. [We’re] just trying to sort out every aspect of our game as a team and do everything we can to get that win.”
Stanford junior driver Bennett Williams and sophomore driver Tyler Abramson with 25 and 24 goals, respectively, lead the Cardinal’s offense. Williams has scored in all eight matches this season, scoring multiple points in six of those games. Redshirt senior goalie Oliver Lewis mans the posts, averaging 12.5 saves and 4.7 goals against per game.  
The game holds special meaning for sophomore transfer driver Sawyer Rhodes, who played for Stanford last season and has scored 9 goals in six games as a Trojan. 
“I mean there’s a lot of emotions,” Rhodes said. “It’ll be my first time back on campus at Stanford, so I’m really excited. [I’m as] nervous as I am before any big game, so I think that’s good. This is what we’ve been training hard for, and we’ve played 17 games but haven’t had a challenge yet. So this will be our first one so we’ll see how good we really are.”
Rhodes scored 23 goals as a true freshman at Stanford last year, one of which came against USC in the pool that is now his home. 
On Sunday, the Trojans return to Uytengsu Aquatics Center for a matchup against No. 16 San Jose State at noon. San Jose State enters the matchup with a 4-4 record after losing to Stanford 16-3 last week. Mercep, who played for San Jose State last season was a scoring powerhouse with 93 goals for the Spartans last season. 
The loss of Mercep will be a hit to the Spartans, who are now led by top scorer sophomore Justin Pickering’s 13 goals and freshman goalie Yahav Fire’s 9.2 saves-per-game average. USC has won six straight matchups against San Jose State. 
The Stanford game will be broadcast on Pac-12 Los Angeles and Pac-12 Bay Area and will also be streamed online.

Major League Baseball does not have a problem with the structure of its playoffs, but it does have a problem with the structure of the Wild Card Game. The single “win or go home” format of the Wild Card Game goes against everything that the series-based season and playoffs stand for.
In one of my first Daily Trojan columns I voiced why MLB has the unique ability to determine which 10 clubs should be playing in the postseason. There is no other professional sport that is able to do that: The NFL, NHL and NBA seasons are too short to account for slumps, fluke wins and streaks. The beauty of the 162-game baseball season is that it allows for all of the aforementioned circumstances to be naturally corrected. 
One of the most supported proposals to the to MLB is to eliminate the effect divisions have on determining which team continues onto the postseason. I have yet to understand why this is so supported. Divisions within leagues are a quintessential part of the scheduling of baseball; therefore, I don’t think the league will ever do away with divisions entirely. As a result, it’s impossible to determine which teams should make the postseason, without doing so arbitrarily. 
For example, teams like the Cleveland Indians, who play in the AL Central, would have an insanely inflated record over teams in tougher divisions like the AL East. For this reason it is incredibly important that MLB considers who should make the playoffs based on the leaders of the established divisions. 
I might support an alteration to the teams in each division. For example, at the end of each season, restructure the divisions. This would allow for each of the six divisions to be more evenly matched, rather than having powerful and weak divisions. I think this option is something to consider. The only downside that I see is that it will significantly harm some of the rivalries in the sport. Can you imagine a day when the Yankees and Red Sox are not in the same division? That would be just wrong. 
However, I do not believe that the playoff system is perfect. The concept of a Wild Card Game (emphasis on game) goes against everything the format of baseball stands for. There is no possibility that two teams will face to play one single game. Every game in the 162-game season is structured in series for a very logical reason: Baseball is an extremely variable sport. On any given day, the No. 1 team can be upset by the worst team. But for some illogical reason, MLB trusts that one game will be able to accurately decide which of the two best non-division winning teams in each league will be able to continue in the postseason bracket.
Consider this: The Baltimore Orioles finished the 2018 season with a .290 record, the 15th worst record in the modern era, yet Baltimore still mounted a win over every 2018 American League playoff team at some point in the season. But the Orioles only won one of the 16 series they played in against American League postseason representatives. So why in the name of Babe Ruth is the wild card representative chosen by the outcome of one game rather than a series? It doesn’t need to be a best of seven or even a best of five — a best of three would suffice in providing balance to the extreme variance of the sport of baseball. More than one game is absolutely necessary to ensure the best teams are playing in October.
One of my favorite mottos is “don’t fix what isn’t broken.” The MLB playoffs are not broken and the league and division structures are not broken. The single-game disservice called the wild card, however, is most certainly broken, and must be fixed to ensure that the best two non-division winning teams have the opportunity to make a postseason run.
