Jay-Z warned us in his 2006 song “Meet The Parents” saying, “First they love me, then they hate me, then they love me again.” The rapper’s lyrics ring true in his own relationships pertaining to his fandom and media criticism. But they are also relevant in light of a growing phenomenon: “cancel culture.” 
In theory, cancel culture shifts a person from being completely celebrated to boycotted and shunned by the masses. But in actuality, artists we’ve canceled have experienced more complex relationships with the fanbase and the general public. In the span of a week, your favorite artist can go from the black sheep of every op-ed and tweet to debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Wait, that’s the story of Kanye West. 
This week, his latest album “Jesus Is King” is expected to sell nearly 275,000 despite Kanye allegedly being canceled.
Outside of an album that is a slight lyrical shift from his past projects, his latest round of interviews and antics are what grants him social media’s most awarded moniker: canceled.
He’s continued his support of President Donald Trump in an interview with famed radio personality Big Boy and claimed Black people “don’t have [their] culture” and that Black people are, in fact, “culture-less.”
He has also been criticized for allegedly making a mockery of Christianity by selling tickets to see his Sunday Service collective, with merch including $50 socks and $225 sweatshirts. 
Despite what any critic can write or what social media says, actual sales numbers can provide better insight into the state of the culture. Not only is Kanye not canceled, but the act of cancelation is socially performative — talked about online but not put into practice. 
I myself have grappled with my support of Kanye. I’ve attended Sunday Service, but I refuse to stream the album. I’m appalled and disgusted by his comments on slavery and the Black community as well as his support for Trump. But I can’t seem to fully let go. 
I haven’t yet separated the “George Bush doesn’t care about Black people” and “The Glory” Kanye from the man that we see today. I may very well be in shock that a Black man like Kanye, who has undoubtedly pushed the hip-hop sound forward for years, can not only support Trump obsessively but also regress the very culture he influenced. That is unfair.
For myself, those who care about the state of hip-hop culture and those granted the privilege to interview the rap legend, it is our job to help push the conversation past canceling Kanye and truly hold him accountable for his actions. We must continue to question and evaluate his evolution as an artist and current political leanings. We must be truly critical of the things we love. 
Since the hype around “Jesus Is King” commenced, music and entertainment media have left dozens of questions unanswered regarding the direction of his new music and his thoughts on the political landscape. 
His most recent press run included appearances on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and “The Late Late Show” with James Corden, as well as interviews with Beats 1 radio’s Zane Lowe and Big Boy. And in all the in interviews ‘Ye has been shielded him from proper scrutiny. 
The latter two music journalism personalities both missed an opportunity to critique and investigate 2019’s version of Kanye West. Yes, his support for Trump and his overwhelming love for Jesus were discussed, but as he spewed inaccuracies, there was no pushback. 
After a rant that included baseless claims that Democrats are making Black people abort their children and that Black people are cultureless, Big Boy tells Kanye, “On a lot of stuff, we’re going to have to agree to disagree,” but “I’m here to celebrate you.” And Lowe’s facial expressions serve as the only critique or inquiry into his support of Trump, as first noted by Jordan Darville of The Fader.
Based on these interviews, it’s not only the fans who are buying into his cult of personality, as showcased from his recent album’s first-week debut but also the media. And this is what feeds the cynical nature of his antics. 
With the upcoming presidential election roughly a year out, it’s a misstep by any interviewer to not dive deeper into his support for Trump and his conservative ideologies. As white media organizations overwhelmingly repackage and misrepresent hip-hop culture, Black journalists and media personalities, such as Big Boy, owe it to hip-hop to correct and call out attacks on Blackness. 
It seems that the Kanye interview is more about quotable moments, ratings and the fanfare of it all, as opposed to actually understanding and deconstructing the artist and his evolution. And quite frankly, as a budding critic who was a pre-Trump fan of Kanye, I find it upsetting to see such abysmal attempts by the media in interviewing modern music’s most eclectic character. 
The role of the press, in politics or in pop culture, is to inform, criticize and encourage debate. To be a watchdog and check those in power. And right now, whether we like it or not, Kanye has the power to influence his fanbase and make a continued mark on hip-hop and popular culture. 
Yes, there are the Naima Cochranes of the world who have been critical of Kanye in their writing, the T.I.’s who have noted that Kanye probably doesn’t read and fans who acknowledge their continued support while calling him out. But those with the monumental opportunity to ask Kanye the tough questions have not risen to the occasion.
Cancel culture is a myth; we’ve already concluded that through Kanye’s sales and sold-out performances. And quite honestly, I don’t believe in just simply expressing my disdain for an artist, public figure or celebrity and leaving it at that. It’s far more meaningful to identify and challenge, critique harmful ideas and escapades perpetuated by those we love and admire. 
As Kanye spews more fallacies and continues his press tour, it’s not only up to the fans to be analytical of who and what we consume but for those in power and with power to ask the essential questions.

At the intersection of music, fashion, culture, activism, sports and food is ComplexCon, a hybrid music festival, streetwear marketplace and art showcase in Long Beach Nov. 2 and 3.
The exhibition featured headlining performances from Kid Cudi and Anderson .Paak & The Free Nationals, celebrity meet and greets, live podcast recordings, panels with cutting-edge industry leaders dubbed ComplexCon(versations), art installations, skateboarding competitions and endless surprises.
Convention-goers flooded the main floor as they stopped by nearly 200 booths littered throughout the 224,000-square-foot Marketplace. This space featured high-end fashion labels selling limited edition releases for top dollar brand “activations” including a crane machine presented by Puma and art galleries showcasing works painted by graffiti artists in real time. 
Celebrities spotted on the floor throughout the weekend included Pharrell Williams, Chance the Rapper, Offset, Lil Yachty, Selena Gomez, Ty Dolla $ign and Usher.
“I had never been to something like that before so it was really cool seeing the Convention Center laid out with a bunch of really unique and individualistic brands,” Mya Davis, a freshman at the Iovine and Young Academy who attended the first day, said. “It was also really surreal seeing a lot of celebrities just roaming the space…it was insane just walking past them and being in the same vicinity.”
One of the standout ComplexCon(versations) on Saturday was titled “The Rise of AfroPop,” featuring some of the most prominent artists bringing the genre to the forefront of pop culture, including Wale, Afro B and Davido. The artists discussed how the landscape of American music has evolved to embrace more international sounds.
“I think Americans are kind of late to the sound,” Afro B said. “‘Fall’ [by Davido] has been out for I think two years before it started to pick up. It’s only this year that ‘Fall’ and ‘Joanna’ [by Afro B] started to pop here. Because we’re singing in English as well so it’s easier for people to connect with what we’re saying … We need more people to be open to playing it on radio.”
Throughout the afternoon, a slew of performers, including Atlanta duo EarthGang, graced the Pigeons and Planes stage. The eccentric Dreamville signees lit up the crowd as they fired prop bills from a money gun and played tracks from their latest release, “Mirrorland,” including “Top Down,” “Bank” and “Up.”
As the first day became night and the curtains rose for Kid Cudi’s headlining performance, a 30-foot-tall foam statue of the artist was revealed, depicted in the cartoon style of Japanese streetwear brand BAPE. Its eyes began to glow red as a single spotlight revealed surprise guest actor Timothée Chalamet sitting in the middle of the stage. 
The “Call Me By Your Name” star and close friend of Cudi began the show by reciting the narrative portion of “In My Dreams (Cudder Anthem),” originally performed by Common, that opens Cudi’s breakout album “Man on the Moon: The End of Day.”
Pyrotechnics erupted as Cudi and surprise guest Pusha T kicked off the set with “Feel the Love,” the first track from Cudi’s 2018 collab project with Kanye West, “Kids See Ghosts.” 
To commemorate the recent 10-year anniversary of “Man on the Moon,” Cudi spent the night taking the audience on a nostalgic journey through his discography. He passionately performed select cuts from that album, its sequel “Man on the Moon 2: The Legend of Mr. Rager” and “Indicud” in chronological order.
“I wanted to do some old songs, some songs I hadn’t done in a while,” Cudi told the audience. “I thought it was only right.”
Near the end of the night, Cudi shared a special moment with an audience member. He identified 22-year-old Jacob Rios in the front of the crowd, acknowledging his tattoo of the “Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager” album cover and signing his arm. He then dedicated the final track of the night, Steve Aoki’s remix of “Pursuit of Happiness,” to him.
“That just made me feel like my life is complete … This is what I was living for,” Rios told the Daily Trojan. “He said ‘This song is for you,’ and dude, I just melted. I felt so at peace.”
The excitement spilled over to Sunday. Two sets by surprise performers were slated for the afternoon on the Pigeons and Planes stage but the artists were not revealed until immediately before they went on. 21 Savage and DaBaby shocked the crowd as the guests, but Savage made it clear he was let  down by the lower turnout that resulted from the last-minute reveal.
“I feel like I’m performing at a talent show or something,” Savage said before playing “can’t leave without it” from his sophomore album “i am > i was.”
One of Sunday’s best ComplexCon(versations), titled “All Hail the Queens: The Women Changing the Face of Rap,” featured Trina and EVE, artists who have paved the way for other women in hip-hop, and two of today’s most prominent women in hip-hop, Rico Nasty and Kamaiyah. 
The panelists spoke on topics ranging from obstacles they’ve faced in the industry, how they’ve uplifted and empowered one another and what their long-term goals are.
“You just have to be strong. You know what, it doesn’t matter how they perceive you,” Trina said. “It doesn’t matter who like you, who don’t like you, as long as you believe in yourself, that’s all that matters. Women are more dominant in the game now than ever before.”
Back on the main stage, the night was beginning to wrap up. Promptly at 7 p.m., the house lights dimmed as trumpeter Maurice Brown sauntered on stage, sounding off a melody that morphed into the opening notes of “The Bird,” the intro to Anderson .Paak’s critically acclaimed “Malibu.” The rest of the Free Nationals assumed their positions at their respective instruments, including .Paak himself center-stage on a drum set covered in artificial foliage.
Arguably one of the best live performers in the game — thanks in large part to backing from the Free Nats — .Paak never fails to bring the house down. The band brought a whole new life to the already vibrant songs with live instrumentation and engaging visuals. From eye-catching wardrobe to flawless choreography to rapid-fire drum solos, everything about .Paak’s live shows screamed unquestionable starpower.
“I’ll keep it g-real, I’m tired as fuck,” .Paak told the audience half an hour into his hour-long set before temporarily getting offstage to allow Ron Avant, Free Nationals keyboardist, to perform a five-minute medley of a jazz piano riff with vocoder covers of Ginuwine’s “Pony” and Tupac and Dr. Dre’s “California Love.”
When .Paak returned, he performed a combination of tracks from his recent releases, “Oxnard” and “Ventura,” as well as older tracks from “Venice” and “Malibu.” Fan favorites included “Suede” and Kaytranada’s “Glowed Up,” during which he aptly encouraged audience members to illuminate the room with their phone lights.
“I won a Grammy on this, so y’all need to turn up one time,” .Paak said as he launched into an energetic rendition of his single “Bubblin.”
White strips of confetti rained down on the audience as Anderson .Paak & The Free Nationals took a bow at the end of their headlining set. With their performance concluded, ComplexCon drew to a fittingly extravagant close.

Now that Week 9 is in the books, it’s time to assess who the legitimate Super Bowl contenders are in each conference, what they bring to the table and their most important remaining games.
AFC
New England Patriots
The Patriots were convincingly defeated Week 9. The team traveled to Baltimore only to let Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson run all over them and hang 37 points on a defense which many thought was on track to be the greatest ever. Despite the rough showing, the Pats still lead the AFC with an 8-1 record and will almost certainly be one of the two teams to earn a first-round bye. 
Baltimore Ravens
Coming off the franchise’s biggest win in a few seasons against the Patriots, the Ravens have firmly entrenched themselves as a Super Bowl threat in the AFC. Their offense is the best run-first offense in the league with the threats posed by Jackson, who leads the team in rushing yards over Pro-Bowl running back Mark Ingram. It’s also important not to undersell Jackson’s abilities throwing the ball, as he’s well above the league average in yards per attempt and passer rating.
The Ravens’ Week 4 loss to the Browns is looking worse with each passing week, though, as the Browns continue to lay one dud after another. Baltimore will have to prove it can back up its win against New England in its remaining games against Houston, Los Angeles Rams, San Francisco and Buffalo. This four-game stretch will tell us much more about what to expect from the Ravens come January. 
Kansas City Chiefs
While quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ knee injury continues to loom over the team, wide receiver Tyreek Hill and running back Damien Williams were able to put the team on their backs for a surprising win at Minnesota in Week 9. Once Mahomes does come back, this offense could be a force to be reckoned with. Their toughest remaining matchups are at New England and Chicago, especially since they both figure to be cold-weather games where the Chiefs’ dynamic passing game may be limited. The rest of the AFC West poses a very minimal threat to the Chiefs, so they will likely end up hosting a playoff game. Whether they get a first-round bye could come down to their tiebreaker over Baltimore by virtue of a head-to-head win in Week 4.
NFC
San Francisco 49ers
The 49ers are the last undefeated team in the league this season, a remarkable feat regardless of schedule. They’ve won in the mud at Washington and blown out a solid Panthers team. Their best unit is their defense, led by defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, cornerback Richard Sherman and a loaded line. However, they lost star linebacker Kwon Alexander to a season-ending injury in last week’s win over the Cardinals.
The 49ers’ offense has also been exceptional, with head coach Kyle Shanahan at the helm of a potent rushing attack. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo had yet to show out this season until he carried the team against the Cardinals with 317 yards and four passing touchdowns. Their recent trade acquisition wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders has already had a massive impact and will likely remain a threat to opposing defenses despite suffering a torn Achilles last December.
The 49ers have a daunting second-half schedule after their stroll to 8-0. They have two games left against the Seahawks and two tough road bouts at Baltimore and New Orleans before taking on the Rams again in Week 16.
New Orleans Saints
The story of the season for the Saints has been an incredible 5-0 run while future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees was out with a thumb injury. Stellar play from the defense and special teams allowed backup Teddy Bridgewater to play with a lead in most games.
The biggest question for the Saints is how big of a step forward the offense will take now that Brees is back. The formula for winning with Bridgewater will not be as reliable when they face better teams in the playoffs, so Brees will have to prove he is still on his A-game before I feel comfortable concluding the Saints are at the heart of the Super Bowl race.
The team’s remaining schedule includes two games against the Panthers — whose fate likely rests on currently-injured quarterback Cam Newton — and home games against the 49ers and Colts in consecutive weeks. It appears highly unlikely the Saints lose their grip on the NFC South. Looking at the bigger picture in the NFC, it looks as though the winner of the Saints-49ers Week 14 game could claim the No. 1 seed, home-field advantage in the playoffs and the best shot at the Super Bowl.

No. 7 USC men’s water polo capped off a perfect home record this season with two victories this weekend over No. 1 Stanford and No. 12 San Jose State. The Trojans achieved a narrow 9-8 upset over the Cardinal Sunday before trouncing San Jose State 17-9 Sunday.
The two wins put the Trojans back on track after two straight single-goal losses against Pacific and Pepperdine. The upset over Stanford was especially important, giving USC a 1-0 start to conference play and the upper hand over the Cardinal in the MPSF.
Saturday’s game was characterized by standout performances on both ends of the pool. Although the Cardinal were able to get off 39 shots, sophomore goalie Nic Porter was on a roll, tallying a career-high 20 saves to consistently keep the Trojans in the game.
“Nic played unbelievable today,” sophomore 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt said following Saturday’s game. “Just to see him in-cage, every time he gets a block, he just hypes all of us up. From the first to the fourth quarter, he was on and that really just hypes us up when we see that.”
Offensively, the Trojans were aided by two hat tricks from drivers freshman Marcus Longton and senior Marin Dasic. Longton’s 3 goals also marked a career best, and his first two scores were important in shifting the momentum toward a Trojan team that fell behind 2-1 early on.
The game was tight throughout, but the Trojans took a 3-goal lead into the fourth quarter. However, Stanford showed resilience, putting up 2 goals in the first three minutes of the period while holding USC’s offense scoreless.
Although the Cardinal cut the Trojans’ lead to 1, they were unable to find the tying goal. Dasic scored his third goal of the game to give the Trojans a 2-goal lead with two minutes to go. By the time Stanford was able to score again, it was too late to mount an equalizing attack, and USC held for the victory.
Despite the strong offensive showings from Longton and Dasic, Porter said the Trojans will need to put even more points on the board to be successful in the remaining conference games this season.
“Our offense is incredibly strong,” Porter said. “We have unbelievable players on offense, so [we need to] put a few more scores on the board, and then conversely, try to stop [our opponent] from scoring as many.”
Hot off Saturday afternoon’s thriller, the Trojans looked to continue their momentum against SJSU. However, the Spartans were strong out of the gate, scoring 3 first-period goals while USC’s offense struggled to ignite. The Trojans scored just 1 goal in the first but had 10 shots that missed the net or were saved by SJSU.
In the second period, the Trojans brushed off the 2-goal deficit and hit hard on offense. Sophomore driver Hannes Daube capitalized on a 6-on-5 drawn by senior two-meter Matt Maier to kick off a slew of USC scores in the second frame. Ehrhardt slammed a shot from way out to give the Trojans their first lead of the match, up 6-5 at the half.
From there, USC never trailed again. Porter’s vision of offensive dominance became a reality, as the Trojans had six multi-goal performers by the end of the game. Dasic posted another hat trick, while Longton netted 2 goals for a total of 5 on the weekend.
As the offense lit up, the Trojan defense was also firing on all cylinders, especially in the fourth quarter. USC outscored SJSU 7-1 in the final period, transforming a close game into a 17-9 blowout within a single frame.
Head coach Marko Pintaric said he was happy to see his team shake off the last two losses.
“We had a couple of meetings, and the team responded well,” Pintaric said. “And that’s a big attribute to our seniors … They had that attitude to refuse to lose, and that’s what I like about this team: resilience.”
The Trojans’ next test will be two difficult road matches against No. 2 UCLA and No. 8 Cal as MPSF play continues.

Following an offseason filled with roster changes and reshuffling, USC women’s basketball will face Cal State Northridge Tuesday in its first game of the season. The Trojans hope to build some early momentum in an effort to make the NCAA tournament for the first time in five years.
After USC went 17-13 and finished in the bottom third of the Pac-12 last season, several of the program’s key players decided to transfer. Senior guard and former captain Minyon Moore left for Oregon after leading the team in rebounds, assists and steals while averaging 14.8 points per game.
Senior forward Ja’Tavia Tapley — who put up the second-most rebounds per game after Moore — also decided to leave the program. The former Trojan will be playing for Arizona State this season. 
In addition to the absence of Moore and Tapley, the Trojans lost two of their best scorers to graduation. Former guard Aliyah Mazyck led the Trojans in scoring last season with 15.3 points per game, while former guard Mariya Moore, Minyon’s sister, put up 13 points per game — good for third on the team.
Despite the departures, the Trojans haven’t lost confidence that this year’s team can turn things around for the once-historic program. 
“Why can’t I be the next person to leave a legacy at an amazing school [and] bring back what USC used to be — [a] top school in the Pac-12, top school in the nation?” senior forward Kayla Overbeck said at Pac-12 Media Day. “Why can’t that be us?”
Overbeck’s confidence in her team is not necessarily misguided. Even though the team lost its top three scorers, a combination of returning players and fresh faces could make the Trojans a formidable team this season. 
For one, Overbeck returns after starting 26 games last year. The senior is a fierce leader and a physical presence in the post. She will be joined by returning guards sophomore Desiree Caldwell and redshirt sophomore Shalexxus Aaron. Given their experience, Overbeck, Caldwell and Aaron are likely to make the starting five in the opener.
Transfers will also play a key role in replacing some of the firepower of the Moore sisters and Mazyck.
Graduate guard Stephanie Watts arrives at USC after setting the ACC on fire last season for North Carolina. She started in 27 games during her redshirt junior season, averaging 15.2 points, 5.5 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game and leading the team with 82 3-pointers on the season. As a graduate transfer, Watts will be eligible to play immediately. 
After starring for a team that made the NCAA tournament last season, Watts made her intentions for the Trojans’ upcoming season clear. 
“I’m here to put USC back on the map,” she said. “We’re gonna do well in the [Pac-12] tournament. We’re gonna do well in the NCAA tournament … A lot of people are maybe overlooking [us] or a little bit [sleeping on us], but I’m excited to show people less talking and more doing of what we’re gonna do this season.”
Watts is joined by fellow graduate transfer and former Morehead State guard Aliyah Jeune. Jeune averaged 16.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game during her senior season as an Eagle and led the team to the second round of the WNIT postseason tournament.
Complementing Watts and Jeune is a crop of highly talented freshmen. USC’s 2019 recruiting class came in at No. 5 according to ESPN and boasts three five-star recruits: point guard Endyia Rogers, center Angel Jackson and forward Alissa Pili, the sister of the football program’s junior defensive tackle Brandon Pili.
Four-star guard Kyra White and three-star guard Madison Campbell have also joined the Trojans this season. 
Despite all of the additions to the roster in the offseason, the transition appears to be going well for USC’s new players.
“Everyone, although we have a lot of new faces, has been just molding together so seamlessly, so I’m glad to be here and glad to be a part of it,” Watts said.
The start of USC’s schedule is not particularly daunting this year. Aside from perennial power No. 6 Texas A&M, the Trojans will not face a single non-conference team that made the NCAA tournament last year.
However, once the Trojans enter Pac-12 play in late December, the story changes. Five Pac-12 teams begin the season among the AP’s top 20 teams, and Oregon and Stanford look especially formidable at No. 1 and No. 3, respectively.
Last year, USC began the season 10-1 before going 7-11 in conference play. Third-year head coach Mark Trakh hopes to flip the script this season by emphasizing a culture of toughness and unity.
“You’ll see a team that plays hard, that’s unified, that’s gonna be a system team,” Trakh said at Pac-12 Media Day. “We want that culture. You’ll see us play hard, [and] you’ll see us play together and that’s what we really have been working on — for all these kids to buy in [and] to be all in on what we want to do this year.”
Trakh also said the team’s shooting ability and physical presence will be two of its main assets this season.
“I think our guards shoot the ball relatively well,” Trakh said. “I think we’ve got enough size, not overwhelming size, but I think we got enough size and strength and skill level that I think we’ll be competitive. That’s what we want to do. We want to compete every night — night in and night out.”
This new-look Trojan team will have its first chance to compete 7 p.m. Tuesday at Cal State Northridge.

It might be a shock to learn that France is the country with the greatest number of time zones a whopping 12 different districts. Of course, the contiguous, metropolitan France is all under the same time jurisdiction; the country has simply colonized lands all over the globe. Tied for the second-greatest number of time zones with 11 are Russia and the United States across its geographic and territorial time zones.  
China, in contrast, established one uniform time zone that adheres to Beijing Standard Time in accordance with the time in Beijing. Chairman Mao Zedong, upon gaining control in 1949, decreed that all of China be governed under the same time zone. This is true despite the fact that China is the same size as the continental U.S. and has five geographical time zones.
One would expect time to be a simple endeavor to manage, but recent U.S. legislation has made the matter more complicated than ever, especially when daylight saving time is factored into the equation. 
There has been much debate over abolishing daylight saving time altogether. One of the main proponents for continuing with the practice is the National Parent Teacher Association, which argues that daylight saving time is necessary to minimize the number of hours school children have to commute to school in the dark. The Department of Transportation is also in favor of maintaining the practice, citing energy saving and, interestingly, a decrease in crime. 
There is little denying human health is dependent on the clock. Researchers note that the average person should be able to adjust to the hour change in just a couple of days. However, the problem lies in people taking advantage of the extra hour of sleep, which may cause a sleep pattern irregularity. 
Several states, including California, are so convinced by the benefits of daylight saving time and the drawbacks of returning to standard time that they have moved to make daylight saving time a permanent phenomena. While many state governors have already signed laws making daylight saving permanent, their time zones will not change unless Congress approves the request, as is required by the 1966 federal law. While there has been no progress on this front, President Donald Trump tweeted the following in March: “Making Daylight Saving Time permanent is OK with me!” 
Although the law restricts states from extending daylight saving time, it does allow them to refuse to adjust their clocks and observe the time change without initial authorization from Congress. That’s exactly what Arizona, Hawaii and several other U.S. territories do. 
Some states, particularly in the New England region, are considering using a legal loophole that would allow them to extend daylight saving without authorization from Congress. Instead of petitioning Congress for permission to permanently observe daylight saving time, they are considering introducing a new time zone entirely: Atlantic Standard Time, which will be one hour ahead of Eastern Standard Time. The reasoning is as follows: If a time zone proposal is introduced in local legislatures, it would not require congressional approval, which is something the courts will ultimately have to decide. 
On the other end of the extreme, Texas is considering permanently observing standard time and abolishing daylight saving time within the state. And just to add to the mix, states like Delaware and Oregon have introduced legislation creating permanent daylight saving time that would only take effect if all other states within their current time zone make the change as well. 
Clearly, there is an overabundance of opinions on what to do regarding a seemingly simple feat: time. When it comes to daylight saving time’s effect on college students, most remain focused on how many 8 a.m. classes they have, what time a professor says an essay is due and, of course, whether they need that extra hour to get it done.

For some, this year’s Homecoming was a time for reunion and celebration, a brief return to the hazy memories of college. For others, Homecoming was a socially acceptable excuse for day drinking. But, for certain Black and Latinx tailgaters, the excitement was dulled and constrained by a large chain-link fence — and the oppressive presence of law enforcement officers. 
The mental image is a gruesome one — the reality, even worse. 
Past the white picket fencing of McCarthy Quad on a relatively tiny square of grass, wire fencing rose high above the tailgaters. Inside were the primarily Black and brown students of Alpha Phi Alpha, Omega Phi Beta and Lambda Upsilon Lambda’s tailgate. 
The section was limited to 200 people and guarded by members of the Department of Public Safety and Los Angeles Police Department. However, there appeared to be space for more, according to one witness who spoke with the Daily Trojan. 
Another attendee, a former member of Omega Phi Beta, stated that specific area had only fit two Greek organizations the year before and had always been open to the public. 
There is a great discrepancy between administrative and witness views regarding the fencing and increased security: Patrick Auerbach, who represents the Alumni Association as the associate senior vice president for alumni relations, defended that the fence was raised as per protocol for organizations choosing to serve alcohol. 
Auerbach also claimed that the three organizations’ representatives had requested the area and thus knew of the 200-person maximum capacity ahead of the tailgate. However, graduate student Nadine Isaacs — an attendee who penned an online petition calling for administrative action — told the Daily Trojan that an alumnus had raised concerns regarding the discriminatory nature of the layout, only for them to be dismissed by organizers. 
Whether intentional or not, the social implications of effectively segregating a group of people of color from the rest of the students and alumni, and enforcing that isolation through excessive police presence, nullifies the Alumni Association’s excuse of following protocol. To be frank, it is only from utter ignorance — a crime in itself — or intentional discrimination that organizers could have thought this situation acceptable. 
A small space fenced off for three large Greek societies of color, with only a fraction of their members allowed in by security and police officers — if this is not deemed discriminatory, then the sky may as well not blue, and USC is no longer a university steeped in scandal and privilege. 
During a time when immigrant children are held captive, imprisoned behind chain-link fencing, the same fencing has no place on our campus, where it is used to disadvantage certain groups of people. The practice is distasteful blatantly unjust and must be discontinued. 
Fortunately, there is a way to get involved. Isaacs’ Change.org petition, named “SegreGATED USC Tailgate,” is nearing its 1000 signature goal. Just a tap on a computer or smartphone contributes to the momentum of this message. 
At this point, it is apparently too much to expect common decency — from students, from administration, from the University. The stench of inequality has long perfumed campus, and those in power have made no moves toward change. If there is to be reform, it won’t come easily. Only through continued persistence and student involvement will the University be forced to take notice of this atrocity. 
Change is not a gift — it is a spoil of war.
