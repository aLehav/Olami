The Office of International Services has closed its physical locations on both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses, the office announced in an email to international students Saturday.
OIS staff will continue to respond to emails sent to the office address, the email read. They will offer remote services until the University resumes in-person classes. In the email, OIS stated it would send international students their immigration documents by mail.
“Although we have planned for the possibility of this change due to COVID-19, our operational plan will continue to evolve in the days ahead,” the email read.
The transition to online instruction has presented unique challenges for international students, who may face difficulty returning home or coming back to the United States when in-person classes resume April 14. Students have been encouraged to vacate on-campus housing through April 13 while classes move online, but students unable to return to their permanent residences are permitted to remain on campus if they email USC Housing by Monday. 
The University will continue to support the international student population and offer virtual coursework for students who are unable to return to campus by the time in-person classes resume, Provost Charles Zukoski told the Daily Trojan in an interview.
“If the [international] students leave the country and cannot get back, then we are delivering education online,” Zukoski said. “We are committed to supporting [students’] academic progress, so we want the students to know that we’re going to work with them under those circumstances.”
USC’s informational website on coronavirus includes a page of topics relevant to international students, including travel, housing and immigration services. The site recommends international students contact OIS by email to discuss visa status before making plans to return to their home countries.
International students will be permitted to take classes virtually during the remote instruction period, in accordance with the Student Exchange Visitor Program’s policies for non-U.S. citizens enrolled at U.S. schools.

A USC undergraduate student in Orange County has tested positive for coronavirus, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman announced in a communitywide email. The student, who recently returned from traveling abroad, has not been on or near USC campuses since.
The student is currently in good condition and in self-isolation at home, following guidelines from public health officials, according to the email. The University is currently contacting those who may have come in contact with the student.
Those who may have been exposed to the virus will be required to self-quarantine, which USC will help accommodate by relocating students and those in close contact with them. 
The measure, intended to reduce community transmission, comes after Los Angeles County announced its first case of community spread Tuesday. As of Sunday, there have been at least 10 likely cases of community spread, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.
USC further advised that individuals with questions regarding the virus should contact the COVID-19 hotline or visit the dedicated website for more answers. The email also encouraged the community to check frequently for University communication to learn of further developments.
