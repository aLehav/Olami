Head football coach Clay Helton has had a penchant for hiring former assistants for his new staff, and Tuesday the trend continued as the Trojans announced the addition of Tommie Robinson as running backs coach.
Robinson served as running backs coach and passing game coordinator for USC in 2013 under head coach Lane Kiffin but was not retained after Steve Sarkisian was hired.
The 52-year-old has plenty of experience at the collegiate and NFL levels — 30 years in all — and he spent the last two seasons as the running backs coach for the Texas Longhorns.
“We are thrilled to welcome back Tommie Robinson to the Trojan Family,” Helton said.  “He is one of the most respected running back coaches in our profession.  He has had an extensive career in both the NFL and college and he will pass on that knowledge to our young running back group.”
Helton also worked with Robinson at Memphis, where they were both assistants in 2006.
“I have had the good fortune to work with Tommie on two different occasions, at USC and at Memphis, and have seen firsthand how he develops young men both on and off the field,” Helton said. “He is a true professional and a terrific recruiter.”
During the 2013 season at USC, Robinson guided the Trojans’ offense to 29 rushing touchdowns, its most in eight years.
After starting his career as a graduate assistant at Arkansas, Robinson spent time at Utah State, TCU, and UNLV. Then came a three-year stint in the NFL with the Dallas Cowboys where he served as a wide receivers and special teams assistant. Prior to his first stint at USC, Robinson was the running backs coach for the Arizona Cardinals from 2010-2012.
Robinson’s career has also seen stops at Memphis, Georgia Tech, Oklahoma State and Miami.
Last season, the Longhorns averaged 5.67 yards per carry under Robinson, who will look to get the best out of several running backs the Trojans plan to feature, including Ronald Jones II and Justin Davis.
Robinson joins Clancy Pendergast (defensive coordinator), Tee Martin (offensive coordinator), John Baxter (special teams coordinator and tight ends coach) and Helton as former assistants under Kiffin who will be on Helton’s staff in 2016. Pendergast and Baxter were brought in while Martin was promoted from wide receivers coach.
Robinson’s hire means that Johnny Nansen, who was the running backs coach the last two seasons at USC, will shift to linebackers coach and recruiting coordinator. Nansen was retained by Helton after coming over with Sarkisian from Washington.

Trojan work horse · Julian Jacobs is second on the team in scoring with 13 points per game. He is also tied for most steals on the team with 26. – Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
Among the many things a prospective student hears from current students, tour guides and faculty is the irreplicable football culture at USC that consumes the campus from August until December every year.
Something that has never been mentioned before is the spirit that surrounds the basketball team (15-3, Pac-12 4-1). There is a new energy on campus, during football off-season no less, and it hasn’t been created by coaching scandals and recruiting signings.
The basketball team is ranked No. 21 in the nation, breaking into the top 25 for the first time in seven years. In 2008, when the Trojans were on the national radar, they had top talent in Taj Gibson and DeMar DeRozan. Now USC has top talent in point guards Jordan McLaughlin and Julian Jacobs and sits atop the Pac-12 conference.
Students on campus know about this too. That is the most remarkable thing. At the beginning of the season, my friends and I attended many basketball games where every word the Spirit Leaders and the Trojan Knights yelled could be heard because there were only 50 fans in the building.
After attending the game against Arizona, I can say with confidence that USC is becoming a basketball school. Andy Enfield’s high flying and very entertaining offense at Florida Gulf Coast was not just a fluke. Enfield has been able to recreate an atmosphere that has ignited a lackluster student body when it comes to basketball.
Defeating UCLA on their court was the next boost that the team needed in order to become a presence on campus. It is unfortunate that, coming off the win against the Bruins and entering the rankings, the Trojans can’t play at home. They travel to Oregon to face the Ducks and the Beavers, and though the amount of people tuning into the games may not be as high as it is when Kansas or North Carolina are playing, USC will give you a game worth watching.
The team is averaging nearly 85 points per game, the highest points per game average in the Pac-12 and eleventh in the nation. Of players in the conference though, the Trojans do not have a single scorer averaging high enough to make it into the top 20 highest-scoring players. McLaughlin is ranked No. 21 in the conference and leads the team with 14 points per game. Following him are fellow Trojans Julian Jacobs, Katin Reinhardt, Nikola Jovanovic and Bennie Boatwright. With five players among the top-30 scorers in the conference, it is easy to see why the Trojans put on a performance worth watching.
This team scores in style though. They lead the Pac-12 in 3-pointers made, and have almost a third of the top-15 three-point shooters in the conference: Bennie Boatwright (35), Elijah Stewart and Jordan McLaughlin (34) and Katin Reinhardt (32).
Enfield’s notorious “Dunk City” identity at FGCU has translated to what some call “SC” or “Slam City” here. USC has 71 dunks through the first 18 games of the season and freshman Chimezie Metu has had at least one dunk in nine of the last 10 games, going for 28 on the season.
Metu has been a dominant force on defense as well, blocking 32 shots this season for the Trojans who rank fourth in the nation in blocked shots.
But what do all these numbers and statistics mean?
You should get yourself to the Galen Center and watch a basketball game. Even if basketball isn’t your first choice to watch, this type of basketball is exciting. People are flying around the court, diving on the ground, slinging the ball around, and most importantly, scoring at a frenetic pace that is sure to captivate all who are watching.
USC has always been, and probably always will be, a football school, and that’s fine. But as a student during this tumultuous athletic era, don’t we deserve to bask in some sports glory while we have it?
Having watched this group of Trojans, I can say with confidence that, though we have a long way to go before reaching the pinnacle of basketball achievement or even coming anywhere near it, this could be the season that goes down in history as the year when USC basketball is put on the map and becomes a force to reckon with.
So as a student, fan or alum, take advantage of the opportunity Slam City has given you, and take part in our Trojan basketball glory.
Hailey Tucker is a sophomore majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. She is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Tucker Talks” runs every other Wednesday.
Well Done Lads.  You can singlehandedly expand the Trojan Nation!  Love the balance this team has…just keep executing and the rewards will be all yours to be such a special athletic story for the ages.  Who would have thought “Pac 12 celler dwellers” of the past few years could climb so fast and so far so quickly.

The No. 2 ranked Women of Troy begin their season Wednesday at Marks Stadium where they will take on UC Santa Barbara.
The Women of Troy start this season ranked No. 2, with five players ranked nationally. Giuliana Olmos is ranked highest at No. 42. Six spots later sits freshman Rianna Valdes at No. 48, while sophomore Madison Westby is at No. 49. Freshman Jessica Failla is at No. 76 in the rankings. Fifth in the singles ladder at No. 114 is junior Zoë Katz.
Westby and Valdes competed at the National Collegiate Tennis Classic over the weekend. Starting as unseeded, they both fell in the quarterfinals. They also paired together in the doubles draw, where they reached the quarterfinals as well.
Olmos and Gabby Smith earned the No. 4 doubles spot in the country after an extraordinary fall season, winning the Oracle/ITA Masters Championships. Smith has also earned a ranking with Jessica Failla, positioning themselves at No. 13. Olmos has played with Valdes as well, reaching No. 54.
The first team to face the Women of Troy is UCSB. The Gauchos are ranked No. 59 in the Nation, and don’t have any singles player ranked nationally.
The biggest obstacle is represented by their doubles team, composed of sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic, ranked at No. 21. During the fall season, they went 10-2, capturing a title at the Jack Kramer invitational. Dubavets also has the most wins in singles, tied with junior Jaimee Gilbertson at seven. Gilbertson finished with a 7-4 record, which includes a title at the Cal Nike Invitational.
The Gaucho’s aim to improve their 16-9 record from last season (6-2 Big West) in which they reached the conference finals before falling short to Long Beach State.
Despite the loss of first and third singles stars Zoe Scandalis and Sabrina Santamaria, who graduated last spring and are now off to the professional circuit, the Women of Troy are still in good hands.
At top spot, senior Giuliana Olmos will help carry the team to success. Olmos just came out of an incredible weekend, reaching both finals in singles and doubles at the Freeman Memorial in Las Vegas. In singles, as the fifth seed, she lost to top-seed and No. 6-ranked Hayley Carter of University of North Carolina with a final score of 1-6, 6-7. It did not finish any better in doubles, where she paired up with sophomore Gabby Smith. Being the second seed, the Trojan pair made it all the way to the final, where they eventually lost to the top seed from UNC.
The last meeting at home between the Trojans and the Gauchos dates back to 2012 and recorded a 7-0 win for the Women of Troy. That year they reached the semifinals at the NCAA Tournament, before falling to UCLA 4-3.
The match begins at 1 p.m. at Marks Stadium.

As the college football recruiting circuit heated up, the Trojans were the interests of potential top recruits this past weekend, with five-star defensive end Rashan Gary, four-star athlete Trevon Sidney and three-star defensive end Connor Murphy stopping by.
Among these four big recruits, Rashan Gary is the most impressive for the Trojans considering his 6-foot-5, 293-pound frame and impressive motor. As it stands, the defensive tackle is being recruited by every top school in the nation, but has only officially visited Michigan, Ole Miss, Auburn and, most recently, USC.
“Gary took an official visit to USC from Thursday to Sunday along with his mother, Jennifer Coney, for what was the fourth of Gary’s five permitted official visits,” ESPN insider Tom VanHaaren said in an ESPN.com blog post. “According to Coney, the visit may have put USC — widely believed to be a long shot -— very much in the picture for the No. 1-ranked prospect.”
As for the other prospects who visited this past weekend, defensive end Murphy could become a Trojan this fall.
Murphy cited his visit this past weekend as a nine out of 10 due to USC’s diverse and intellectual campus. Potential USC recruit of the same surname, four-star recruit Byron Murphy, is still expected to visit USC at a later date.
Other recruits interested in being Trojans include four-star tight end and defensive end Devin Asiasi, five-star defensive end Jonathan Kongbo and three-star athlete Evan Hinson.
USC has already established 14 total commitments from 11 four-star and three three-star recruits, with only six more scholarships to give considering the five redshirt freshmen returning to the team in 2016.
After a disappointing Holiday Bowl loss at the hands of the Wisconsin Badgers, USC is looking forward to the future in their 2016 recruiting class as well as their returners.
What the Trojans are not looking forward to are the losses of several starters and 20 overall players due to expiring NCAA eligibility and the upcoming NFL Draft.
On defense, USC’s defensive line is a virtual ghost town due to the departures of starters Antwaun Woods, Delvon Simmons and Greg Townsend Jr., along with reserves Claude Pelon and Cody Temple who combined for 173 of USC’s 1,052 total tackles.
Replacing them will be one of USC’s most talented defensive lines in the Pat Haden era with returning freshmen Rasheem Green, Noah Jefferson, Jacob Daniel, Kevin Scott, Christian Rector, fifth-year senior Jordan Simmons, fourth-year junior Kenny Bigelow Jr. and third-year sophomore Malik Dorton.
Along with a potential signee in defensive tackle Rashan Gary, Liam Jimmons from Huntington Beach, Oluwole Betiku from Gardena Serra and Keyshon Camp from Lake Gibson Senior in Lakeland, Florida, all verbally committed to USC this year.
USC has three-star OLB Jordan Iosefa and four-star cornerback C.J. Pollard to assure USC’s secondary, which will be losing inside linebacker Anthony Sarao and cornerbacks Keyvon Seymour and Ryan Dillard.
On the offensive side of the ball, running back Tre Madden, tight end Cyrus Hobbi, fullbacks Soma Vainuku and Jahleel Pinner and wideouts George Katrib and David Mellstrom are not returning in 2016.
Besides Madden and Pinner, none of the other offensive losses should hurt USC considering JuJu Smith-Schuster, Ronald Jones II, Justin Davis, Steven Mitchell Jr., Adoree’ Jackson, Darreus Rogers, Jalen Greene, Justin Davis and Tyler Petite are all returning.
The team will, however, be losing three big players on the line of scrimmage with quarterback Cody Kessler, center Max Tuerk and offensive guard Erick Jepsen all leaving.
The Trojans should not be concerned with the offensive line, though, with a majority of their 2015 starters coming back in 2016, including center Khaliel Rodgers.
As for the quarterback situation, redshirt junior Max Browne is considered the most-likely starter amid a multitude of passers such as redshirt senior Conner Sullivan, sophomores Sam Darnold and Michael Bowman and four-star recruit Matt Fink.
Although Browne has the height and experience to lead this Trojan football team, dual-threat Sam Darnold could shake up the competition with his running and throwing capabilities.
“There will be a position battle in spring between Max Browne and Sam Darnold that should be a lot of fun to watch,” ESPN and WeAreSC.com writer Garry Paskwietz said in an ESPN.com interview. “The one twist is that there will be a new offensive coordinator in Tee Martin which means Browne and Darnold are both starting from the same beginning point in that system.”
If Darnold gets the starting job as a dual-threat, he could pave the way for 2016 commit Matt Fink, who also thrives with his legs.
And while Darnold threw for 2,985 yards and 39 touchdowns and rushed for 785 yards and 13 touchdowns in his final high school season, Fink showed during his senior season with Glendora that he could also drive the ball with his legs and his arm, amassing 1,258 yards and 15 touchdowns through the air and 1,106 yards and 17 touchdowns on the ground.
Regardless of who is under center for the Trojans come fall, USC is going to have some exciting young players catching passes, including four four-star wide receivers: Tyler Vaughns, Josh Imatorbhebhe, Michael Pittman and Velus Jones.
Out of the four wideouts,  Pittman had the best senior season in high school statistically, catching 81 passes for 1,990 yards and 24 touchdowns. Vaughns, however, could outduel Pittman for a potential starting role considering his soft hands and unbelievable catching abilities while airborne.
With spring practices in full swing and the official spring game just months away, head coach Clay Helton and the rest of his new coaching regime have a lot of work on their hands, but they won’t be without some talented freshmen come Sept. 3 in Arlington.

Government officials, organization leaders and community members convened at USC Saturday for the 24th Annual Empowerment Congress Summit to tackle the issues faced by the Los Angeles community in the new year.
The conference was organized by the Empowerment Congress, a coalition of business, community and government leaders who meet throughout the year to tackle important issues. The Empowerment Congress was created in 1992 by then-Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who presented at Saturday’s summit and is now a Los Angeles County supervisor.
Event moderator Chris Schauble, a KTLA news anchor, described the purpose of the summit as a way for attendees to “acquire the necessary resources to fortify the neighborhoods where you live.” Ridley-Thomas called the congress an “experiment in participatory democracy.”
Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath gave introductory and welcome remarks at the main session in Bovard Auditorium, saying, “Politics is more than just catchy slogans or flashy posters. Politics is an opportunity to create social change. The Empowerment Congress has undeniably strengthened our community’s bond.”
The summit speakers focused primarily on the issue of homelessness in Los Angeles. According to Kevin de León, president pro tempore of the State Senate, California is “the nation’s homelessness capital” and Los Angeles is “the epicenter of homelessness in the entire nation.”
“Homelessness is the defining civic issue in the county of Los Angeles, and we need to confront it,” Ridley-Thomas said. “Some of you may think it’s tough to deal with this on a Saturday morning, but think of those who have to deal with this 24/7.”
De León said Los Angeles County contains 40 percent of the state’s homeless population. His office announced last Monday the No Place Like Home initiative, which includes $2 billion toward tackling homelessness across the state. During his summit presentation, de León argued that all levels of government must work together to achieve results.
“We have to do everything in our power to tackle this problem once and for all,” de León said.
Dora Gallo, CEO of an affordable housing nonprofit called A Community of Friends, said she hopes increased awareness of the homeless will lead to action.
“Homelessness has always been a serious problem, but … in the last couple of years, encampments increased 85 percent,” Gallo said. “That’s huge, and that’s why you’re seeing it more. The numbers have gone up slightly—they’re still pretty high—but the visibility is what people are caught off-guard by and what everyone is now reacting to. Which is good, because it’s bringing publicity to the issue and maybe it means that this time they’re going to do something about it and put the money where we need to put it so we can actually make it end.”
Los Angeles City Councilman Marqueece Harris-Dawson took the stage to inform the audience of a proposal put forth by the city’s Homelessness and Empowerment Committee last week. The proposal includes “no less than” $100 million in funding to fight homelessness,” and Harris-Dawson said he expects the city to adopt the proposal in February.
“The only way we get this right is pulling together,” Harris-Dawson said. “We can see a Los Angeles where everybody has a place to lay their head at night, everybody has a bright future, and everybody can live up to the best of their potential.”
Supervisor Ridley-Thomas described a strategy to fight homelessness in L.A. County that includes enhanced crisis response systems, increased affordable housing resources, increased wages and expanded access to living-wage jobs. He said that county workers from across a variety of departments are teaming up against the issue.
Pauley Perrette, an actress from the television series NCIS, was attacked on the street in Hollywood by a homeless man she described as mentally ill. She recounted her experience during the summit and described how her empathy pushed her toward action to end homelessness.
“Anyone can become homeless in a second, from a divorce or the loss of a job or an illness,” Perrette said. “My heart breaks for that man, and for the eyes I was staring into and the soul, and the loss of him.”
Overarching the entire summit was the concept of a strong community, something that presenters felt was especially pertinent during the weekend of MLK Day.
“We can’t waste any time,” Ridley-Thomas said. “No more dilly-dallying. No more bureaucratic games. We have to step up. Don’t celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King’s birthday if you’re not ready to carry out his dream. We’ve got to explore every single avenue to make sure we stand in our time and do the best we can do.”

Romanian filmmaker Radu Jude’s newest film Aferim! is a powerful yet wonderfully entertaining story that takes the audience to the 19th-century Ottoman Empire for a ride that won’t be forgotten anytime soon.
It’s 1835 and gypsies run rampant in the Ottoman Empire. Brilliantly shot in black and white 35mm, Aferim! goes on a journey with Romanian constable Costandin and his son Ionita who are ordered by a rich boyar to find the runaway slave that slept with his wife. The film is an homage to westerns, but it would be a shame to not include the other elements that make the film as deliciously fun as it is. Costandin and Ionita hurl every racist, antisemitic and sexist insult in the book without reservation. Hey — it was a different time back then. The dark humor works because it was a nightmarish time to live in. The father and son aren’t exempt to anyone else’s cruelty either. This dryly delivered humor balances well with the heavy social issues present that makes the film worth anyone’s time to watch. Aferim! reminds the world that classic cinema isn’t dead. Just foreign. After reviewing the film, the Daily Trojan had the chance to ask the writer and director of the film, Radu Jude, a few questions.
Daily Trojan: What was the inspiration for this film and did the lack of movies on gypsy slavery contribute?
Radu Jude: In terms of inspiration, it is difficult to discern them, I mean the ones which are decisive compared with the ones which are only simple accessories. The real answer is that the inspiration comes from everything. I am sure I wouldn’t have made this film if I wouldn’t have had the life I lived, the meetings I had, the books I’ve read, the thoughts I had. Everything. If I have to think of some clear inspiration sources, first I would mention the history books I’ve read, because I have an interest in the past, in the history and this preoccupation made me search and read some books. Then, when the idea for this film appeared, my inspiration was mostly related to the specific research: meeting with historians, reading collection of documents, old books history books again and so on. My nature is more oriented towards literature and less towards films, but there were also classical Westerns that proved to be an inspiration. One would be The Searchers of John Ford. Other would be A City of Sadness by Hou Hsiao Hsien for the way he found in the past of Taiwan things relevant for today, an approach I felt it is mine as well. But as I said, everything could become a source of inspiration.  If the lack of films on the slavery contributed? I would say no. If I imagine, let’s say, that there are dozens of Romanians films on the topic, I think I would still have directed this film because it is not the novelty of the theme that prompts me to work, but simply my desire to investigate it, regardless how many have done it before.
DT: What was behind the decision to shoot the film on black and white, 35 mm film stock?
RJ: That’s so weird, it is the question everybody — literally, everybody — asks. But for me it is something very simple. Black and white is just one of the tools a filmmaker can use. Of course there are other reasons behind this decision, like the desire to make the viewer acknowledge the artificial nature of the cinematic medium — something which is not taken for granted by many viewers — and the desire to emulate the old Westerns, but otherwise it is just a possible tool. Regarding the 35 mm, well, we have tested different cameras, including digital, and we screened them together. When seeing the images one after another, it was obvious that the 35mm looked better in terms of the classical look we wanted to achieve.
DT: What advice do you have for young filmmakers today?
RJ: I am sorry to disappoint, but I am not able to provide advices, I am in great need myself for useful ones. I stopped searching for them anyway, because an advice is always a kind of stupid cliché like “Be yourself!” or “Follow your vision!” or “Do your best and relax!”, etc. I remember reading [director Steven] Spielberg’s answer to this question and he advised the filmmakers to stay in shape, to work out because the shoot might be tiring. I think he is right; if you are fat, you can find it difficult to move quickly on the film set.
Packs more than a punch! “Aferim” should warn viewers so that those who don’t like to be traumatized by entertainment can avoid it. Closing my eyes failed to protect me from the agony… no escaping the slave’s protracted shrieks as he suffered and probably died from his master’s brutal sexual torture, meant to terrorize his subjects. This film vividly portrays the 1835 Ottoman Empire’s barbarous racial and religious hatreds that still fuel conflict, and how participants endured.

I bring books everywhere. I bring them on the train, to class, to work. Even if I don’t get the chance to read, I bring them anyway, just in case. I also bring books on dates. They fill the lonely lag time between drinks or when one of us goes to the bathroom. And generally, the people I date tend to respond favorably to a studious partner.
Recently, I went on a date to a film screening at the Hammer Museum and brought along One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez. My habit of reading between interactions had been novel once, but my partner was used to it now. He returned to me unfazed, instead commenting that I was the only voracious reader he knew who had not transitioned to a Kindle. “There’s no justifying books anymore,” he said. “Kindles are just better.”
Rationally, I had to agree. I used a Kindle for my classes abroad, and it considerably lightened my load. I still use it for certain classes, when the book is markedly cheaper in that format than hard copy.
But on an emotional level, I couldn’t make the commitment. Not completely. The truth was I had never fallen in love with a Kindle book the way I had with the paper version, not even Salman Rushdie’s The Moor’s Last Sigh, which I devoured in under a week. Books I’ve read in hard copy have stayed with me for years, soothing me with their soft covers and dog-eared pages. I know that in that specific body, there is a specific story, specific ideas, a specific voice. A book is knowable, like a person.
In a Kindle, the stories are all mixed together. Ayn Rand lives in the same space as Walter Benjamin, Noam Chomsky in the same typeface as Dan Brown. A Kindle is like a city masquerading as a singular person and the duplicity of it is somewhat off-putting.
Of course, none of this was nearly as eloquent when I offered my date a defense of physical books. I hadn’t thought about it really; I merely felt a difference. There were certain books I just cared too much for to allow them to languish in the muddled cacophony of my Kindle.
But the truth is, I am that polyphonic medley of interwoven stories, my ideologies tangled somewhere between the levity Demetri Martin and the heft of Ernest Hemingway, the unruly wordplay of Toni Morrison and the unambiguous explanations of Stephen Pinker. My date, a voracious reader himself, was just as complex. As comfortable as it was to condense us both into our own contained, multifaceted book, it wasn’t accurate. I wouldn’t want him to see me as just one way and it wouldn’t be realistic or respectful for me to reduce him either.
Had I reduced all my former flames to keep my love for them simple? Had I only fallen for those I could see one way? I had, after all, experienced some rude disillusionments after ending certain relationships and realizing that the person I was in love with was not the person I idealized at all.
Orhan Pamuk says that reading a good book feels like reading yourself and maybe that’s what I’ve been doing — reading myself into my lovers until they become much less intricate as they actually are. I’m not learning anything from that, I’m just repeating the same tired steps: flirt, date, love (sometimes), break-up, repeat.
When I read, I don’t want to be placated. I want to be educated. If I wanted to see things the same way forever and never expand my understanding, I would be saving a lot of money on college. That’s why my friend group is so diverse — I like the distinctive perspectives.
My date was right, Kindles are better. Kindles are an ideal — the ultimate acceptance of the multiplicity of another and in oneself, a supreme intimacy unachievable by even the most complicated novels. Some of those singular versions are worth cherishing simply for what they say about who I was when I read them. Starting off by viewing my lover as a book rather than a Kindle is a lens allowed me to reevaluate my own identity in a nutshell, where I stand at that particular time. It’s a heuristic I can and must expand upon, to really connect with myself or anyone else. And I have to start somewhere.

The image of a drowned Syrian-Kurdish Alan Kurdi — lifeless and face down on a Turkish beach — has become a symbol of the refugee crisis. The media coverage of his death constructed a single tragedy into a unifying narrative, which not only brought attention to the gravity of the situation but also humanized the plight of refugees. Despite an outcry from the international community as a result of the photo, the innocence of this child has been suffocated by bigotry manufactured through the media. The French magazine Charlie Hebdo sparked controversy recently after publishing a political cartoon featuring the young boy earlier this month. Under the guise of satire, the publication debases the humanity of an innocent child and slanders the morality of Syrians, who seek refuge from persecution, torture and death.
The cartoon imagines Kurdi as an adult and depicts him as an ape who molests women in Germany. It reads, “What would little Aylan grow up to be? A groper in Germany.” The satirical commentary responds to charges in Cologne, Germany, accusing many migrants of sexual assault in the face of already-established French anxiety toward refugees in Europe.
Time and time again, Charlie Hebdo has manufactured insensitive and distasteful hate speech, packaged commercially as freedom of expression. Cheap publications like Charlie Hebdo maintain that racist and religious rhetoric mocks the rationale of those who employ stereotypes; however in doing so, they blatantly perpetuate racist and anti-religious sentiment. In the case of Alan Kurdi, it is unjustifiable to pervert the image of a minor to criminalize Syrian refugees entirely and to hypersexualize its entire male population, which is not only an act of slander but also of degradation. By drawing a parallel between the child and a sex offender, this cartoon relegates the tragedy of Kurdi’s death by dehumanizing him into a depraved member of society deserving of little dignity, and it also suggests that his death should be celebrated, not mourned. To European readers, most of whom may be potentially blindsided by rampant anti-refugee hysteria, it says quite simply that a dead Syrian is one less predator on the streets.
A child — fleeing a civil war with proportions similar to genocide and accompanied by unbridled terrorism — drowned tragically as a Syrian refugee. But through the work of irresponsible journalism, he was killed again, as an innocent three-year-old victim to character assassination.
The recently published Charlie Hebdo cartoon is one of many that mocked the death of Kurdi. One cartoon depicts the lifeless body of Kurdi under a caption reading “So Close to the Goal” and an advertisement above him reading, “Two children’s menus for the price of one.” Another cartoon uses the image as a vehicle to mock Islam with a caption that read “Proof that Europe is Christian.” These cartoons are calculated and consistent in obscuring the fine line between slander and its counterpart, satire. The problem with “satire” of this variety is its othering of Syrian refugees, which redefines one of the greatest humanitarian crises of our time as an issue of us-versus-them.
The publication of the cartoon comes only a year after a terrorist attack targeting the Charlie Hebdo office. The attack left a total of 12 people dead and was prompted by a satirical cartoon mocking Islam and its prophet, Mohammad. While the massacre of these journalists is unwarranted, the magazine is clearly no stranger to ill-advised and irresponsible satire; additionally, it also is well aware of the potential harm a simple drawing can cause.
After the attack, the slogan “Je suis Charlie” (“I am Charlie”) quickly grew into a social movement to defend both “freedom of speech” and “the spirit of the republic.” Yet much of the rhetoric surrounding the attack proved to be far too reductive in that it included obscenity and subsequent hate speech under the umbrella of free expression and democratic values. Thus, to a publication that tactfully degrades tragedy and heartlessly criminalizes Syrians altogether, I say “Je ne suis pas Charlie” (“I am not Charlie”). I stand in solidarity for hate-free expression and respect for all members of humanity, so I say “Je suis Alan Kurdi” (“I am Alan Kurdi”).

With all due respect to the dead child, the fact of the massacre in Paris remains. The fact of the Cologne attacks remains as well as the flood of similar attacks across Europe. Drawing disrespectful cartoons never justifies murder-except for when it comes to Islam, apparently. This is the same ideology that mandates death for those who leave Islam. hardly surprising that those who criticize Islam should expect the same.
And you wonder why Europeans don’t want Muslims in their countries?
3 rapes and hundreds of sexual assaults , and even more robberies, in Germany by a thousand Muslims and you think people need to forget about that and “save the poor Muslims !” 
No body is listening to you. We hear what you say , but we disagree. 
PS: If you’re going to deplore people being punished for a few bad apples , you need to stop talking about “The media”
One of us is missing the point of this satire. I interpreted it as more of a “shame on the world” for their supposed sympathies (evoked by the dying child) that go away once faced with actually having to help refugees. It’s edgy, and perhaps not overt enough for the masses, but perhaps everyone is missing the point?

California has a serious and potentially long-term deficit on its hands. As the state’s demographics shift and employers demand a new type of employees, California’s shortage of college graduates requires serious attention.
The governor’s proposed budget makes some strides in funding human capital, but it cannot do enough to tackle the human capital deficit with California’s restrictive tax system — supported by Proposition 13 — barring the way. Californians must repeal Proposition 13 before the next economic slowdown puts our state’s future in jeopardy.
Almost four decades ago, California voters passed Proposition 13, the ballot measure that transformed the state’s political and financial landscape. Proposition 13 severely restricted property tax rates, forcing California to rely on other sources of revenue to fund public ventures. Today, 31.2 percent of the state’s revenue comes from property taxes — a percentage less than that of Washington and Oregon as well as other states like New York, New Jersey and Texas. In lieu of property taxes, 56.5 percent of California’s revenue comes from income and sales taxes, revenue sources that fluctuate far more with the economy. In an economic downturn, state revenues from these taxes are assured to take a hit, endangering vital public services, like higher education. What’s more, as USC Price professor Dowell Myers wrote in the 2012 paper “California Futures,” the underlying assumptions that spurred the measure’s passage are changing. Proposition 13 is out of date, and its damaging effects are clearly visible in the proposed budget.
Granted, Gov. Brown’s budget does increase spending on higher education. General fund allotments to the University of California, California State University and California Community College systems are significantly higher than those of last year, and the budget provides for desperately needed one-time maintenance costs. As a result, neither the UCs nor the CSUs will need to increase tuition payments.
These allocations represent laudable incremental increases in higher education funding. They don’t, however, meet the need for a vast increase in college graduates — resulting in a shortage that the Public Policy Institute of California estimates will reach a million workers by 2025. Although the state appears to be steadily increasing funding, higher education allotments to the UCs and CSUs have decreased by about $1 billion from pre-recession levels in 2007 and 2008. The CSU system in particular cannot currently fulfill its mission to educate any qualified student; in fact, between 2009 and 2014, the CSU system as a whole turned away almost 140,000 students previously deemed eligible. With graduation rates at the CSUs at about 25 percent, state policymakers may be aiming to increase participation in community colleges as an introduction to postsecondary education. But even so, capacity at the CSUs will have to expand to meet the need for transfer students, which constitute about 45 percent of their student bodies — and could increase with as community colleges produce more graduates. These needs could be met with increased reliance on a more stable revenue stream and the repeal of Proposition 13.
The proposed budget meets many of the system’s current needs and keeps costs down for students. It does lack a certain aspirational quality, as the increase in funding is small compared to the state’s burgeoning revenue. This, however, cannot be attributed to Brown. The higher education allocations are fair in light of the need for long-term planning, made more crucial by California’s antiquated system of raising revenue.
One of the central principles of Brown’s budget is, in the governor’s words, “If you don’t remember anything else, just remember, everything that goes up comes down.”  With years of mostly uninterrupted growth, the state needs to plan for an economic downturn, and the governor’s budget includes a $3.5 billion proposed addition to the state rainy-day fund. The tradeoff is clear: California cannot immediately spend its excess revenues on higher education (or other worthy programs), because in a recession, revenue from sales and income taxes will dry up.
The governor’s proposed budget represents a respectable, incremental step to meeting the human capital shortage in the state. But if the citizens and business community of California want a more drastic commitment to elevating human capital in the state, we must concern ourselves with the tax structure supported by Proposition 13. As long as the current tax structure stands, the state cannot rely on a sustainable source of revenue to fund human capital investment.
Prop 13 saved California’s from losing their homes as prices rose. Even today, most folks who have owned their homes since 2008 hqve seen their home values rise and might not be able to keep the home if taxes rose. Taxes are paid every year, but you don’t sell your home all that frequently.   The problem is that the  governor and legislature continues to spend money they don’t have and have failed to prioritize  the budget. 
College is not for everyone. Trade schools, tech schools and the like are where a lot of kids le a run a trade that will provide for a good standard of living.  I know many folks in IT who do not have a college degree, but went to trade tech to learn application  development skills, and they’Re making over $100k today.
If Prop 13 is ever rescind3d, god forbid, you will find the financial on CA will be more significant than keeping it. People will leave CA and reside elsewhere. CA already has the 2nd h I great state income tax and you’re advocating raising it even more? That’s insane and detrimental to the residents.
States that do not have state income tax generate income from other sources, such hug her vehicle registration fees than CA, higher real,estate fees and the cost of housing is much lower than in CA.  There’s no quick fix to support your proposal other than to ruin CA. How about pushing for a balanced state budget, reducing unnecessary spending. There are many ways the legislature frivolous spends our tax dollars. Let’s hold Sacramento accountable.

This article is not about whether greek life is bad.
There are a thousand other pieces with that title and a thousand opinion writers who’ve called for fraternities and sororities to be abolished, repealed and burned with fire and brimstone.
For greek institutions, their reputation of “-isms” precedes them.
Every few months comes an exposé of greek life and sexism, from gender roles during rush to the undeniable presence of rape culture. Just this year, a highly publicized racial attack on the Row showed us that they can promote straight up racism.
Our houses and their love affair with -isms have graced national headlines. But the most obvious hate nestled between greek letters is rarely talked about.
Fraternities are classist. Sororities are classist. Greek life rests on classism, the prejudice against a person based on their social class.
The Row isn’t where students may face this -ism. The system itself embodies it.
In the fountain of social elitism we call 28th Street, there is all but a “rich only” sign.
There’s no denying Panhellenic fees are expensive. The Daily Pennsylvanian called them “unreasonably high” at UPenn at a maximum of $1,000. At USC, a semester’s dues cost up to $2,500.
For some students on financial aid, simply joining takes food off their family’s table.
That’s saying if those students could get in.
For sororities, it costs nearly $100 to pay rush fees. In contrast, students at state schools, like SUNY Binghampton, can rush for $20 plus a T-shirt. But getting in is even more expensive.
Maybe some houses are exclusive to rich girls, but they all look for pretty pledges. It’s because beauty is catered to conventions of a wealthy white elite. During rush, expensive treatments echo down the perfectly trimmed lawns. Facials. Keratin. The gel nails, the perfect diamond necklace, a flawless face of makeup, followed by a week of pricey outfits. The cost of sisterhood is pretty, and pretty ain’t cheap.
But for the undercover models who make the cut without breaking the bank, joining a sorority is like writing a blank check. From group shirts and invite outfits to seemingly mandatory Disneyland, Vegas and Spring Break trips — if you can’t pay up, you can’t sit with us.
Not that the men are much better. The fraternity cycle churns out rich white boys like the stomach of any guy who can’t afford the price of brotherhood.
Although USC doesn’t offer demographics on its greek population, Princeton University found that 95 percent of those who wear letters come from the wealthiest quarter of America. Only 5 percent of greek brothers and sisters are from the lower or middle class. As the Century Foundation pointed out, “over 60 percent came from private high schools.”
Trojans could claim that it’s different here, but knowing how traditional USC is — and the assortment of BMWs in front of houses — one could only expect this trend amplified. Perhaps we do not investigate the demographics at USC because of how appalling they’d look.
Moreover, classism on the Row doesn’t just accompany racism. It encourages it.
According to Maya Richard Craven, a senior majoring in creative writing:
“People of color are specifically discriminated against during the rush process… Because people of color tend to have lower incomes than white Americans, this may hurt the chances for a girl to get into a house that cares about socioeconomic status.”
While some may defend the accusation of elitism by claiming that Panhellenic offers scholarships, they often come at the cost of tokenism.
According to Cornell University, 2 percent of the U.S. population is in fraternities; yet greek alumni constitute 80 percent of Fortune 500 executives, 76 percent of senators and congressmen and 85 percent of Supreme Court justices.
Classism in greek life isn’t just making the rich kid cool. It’s keeping the cool kid rich.
Last year saw a historic rise in activism. Hundreds of students rallied for the Undergraduate Student Government diversity resolution to combat racism, sexism and queerphobia. Its meetings were the most attended in USC history.
But the resolution mentioned classism only in passing, and offered no tangible ways to address it.
When USG Senate addressed classism, social justice warriors stayed home.
According to USG Student Body President Rini Sampath, “We need students to get behind initiatives such as the college affordability resolution, which asks for a tuition freeze and for USC to recommit to financial transparency, because they are built to help students of all classes, and not just some.” The resolution, which passed in November, has gotten minuscule attention from the student body in comparison to the diversity resolution or calls to delay rush.
This issue is not just another problem; it’s the nexus of the Venn diagram of oppression.
Whether you’re queer, a person of color or disabled mentally or physically, a low-income background amplifies your struggle. Caitlyn Jenner will never face the same fear as a transgender woman who can only support herself through sex work. Someone with schizophrenia who can afford medication can conform to society — without it, their life path is dismissed as a prison pipeline.
According to Sampath, Trojans “dismiss the student activists (e.g. SCALE) who speak out against the low wages of our university workers as extremists.” Imagine if they addressed the discrimination against lower-income students on the Row.
Fraternities and sororities are expected to shove classism under the rug. The bar is higher for those who regularly fight for social justice.
We must remember what student activism would look like if complaints about the lack of LGBT resources couldn’t be posted from MacBooks or if the I, Too, Am USC campaign wasn’t taken by an expensive DSLR camera.
It’s time to recognize the privilege of the people always telling us to check ours.

The year is fresh and the semester is new — welcome back, fellow Trojans! To start off the new year and the second week of school, here’s a playlist for studying, doing homework or socializing with friends.
1. “Hello Vs. Party & Bullshit (Matoma Remix)” [EXPLICIT]  – Ice Cube ft. Dr. Dre & MC Ren Vs. The Notorious B.I.G.
 I want to begin the playlist with a song that has a West and East Coast old school hip hop vibe with a hint of today’s popular genre of music. I highly suggest listening to both “Hello” and “Party & Bullshit” by themselves, but with this remix, the sexy sax tune in the beginning will get you hooked instantly.
2. “Faded” (Steve James Remix) – ZHU
Though the song title expresses a “chill” context, the music helps relieve stress from the first and second week of classes. Don’t party too hard.
3. “Summertime” – K-391
Summertime is more techno with a similar tune to Red Hot Chili Pepper’s “Otherside.” I promise you it gets good at the end. The rush in this song along with calming moments can keep your study pace constant.
4. “Lean on” – Major Lazer, DJ Snake Feat. MØ
The most played song of last year, “Lean On” tells us to focus and fire your concentration (a gun) in your studies. You can always lean on your books if you get too tired.
5. “Clubbed To Death” – Rob Dougan
“Clubbed to Death” is a perfect song for rushing work. I personally use “Clubbed To Death” as a workout song. 
 
6. “Divinity” feat. Amy Millan – Porter Robinson
Porter Robinson’s tune along with Amy Millian’s voice is magnetizing to your ears. I highly suggest listening to this song with headphones; the music will produce such a magnetic force that you’ll never be able to take them off. Hopefully this tune won’t distract you from your studies.
7. “I’m Going Down” (Feat. Florence Welch & Kid Harpoon)
The song tells a story of a person needing a lover’s presence. Florence Welch, from Florence + the Machine sings part of the vocals, and her warm voice will a smile to your face.  It’s the perfect tune to end the playlist (or replay it with)! 
This New Year’s playlist not only gives you the power to focus on your school work, but the confidence to send you sailing through the semester.

There were a lot of ways to go with this Harry Potter playlist. While my roommate suggested such classics as “Can’t Touch This” and “Who Let The Dogs Out” to typify Sorcerer’s Stone and Prisoner of Askaban, respectively, there is a certain merit to subtlety — which is why I included Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda.” How better can you represent the basilisk? The songs are arranged by and loosely related to the Harry Potter books.
If you’re hyped for JK Rowling’s newest project, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, get in a magical mood with this playlist.

Book 5

The Los Angeles Police Department responded to reports of shots fired Tuesday night at Jesse Brewer Park at the intersection of Vermont and Exposition Boulevard. The suspect fled on the Metro and was taken into custody by the Sheriff’s Department shortly after. One victim, not affiliated with the University,  suffered gunshot wounds and was transported to the hospital, where they passed away, Department of Public Safety Deputy Chief David Carlisle said. 
Both the shooter and the victim have no connection to USC. DPS issued a Trojan Alert to students and faculty in case the LAPD investigation caused an increase in traffic at the intersection. However, there was never a cause to issue a campus lockdown.
“There was an investigation at the crime scene so we expected that the area would be impacted,” Carlisle said. “We were told early on that the suspect had fled and that later on he was captured so at no time did we see a direct threat to USC.”
Hmm, somebody gets shot and killed across the street from the campus and that is not reason enough for a lockdown.  Way to go, DPS.
