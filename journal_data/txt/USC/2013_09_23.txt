USC Provost Elizabeth Garrett appointed Norbert Schwarz as Provost Professor of Psychology and Marketing and Daphna Oyserman as Dean’s Professor of Psychology, as well as professor of psychology, education and communication. Both professors are from the University of Michigan.
Oyserman and Schwarz, who are married, will begin their posts in January and will open the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ Mind and Society Center at the Verna and Peter Dauterive Hall, USC’s first interdisciplinary social sciences building, this summer when the Hall is completed.
Currently Oyserman is the Edwin J. Thomas Collegiate Professor of Social Work and Schwarz is the Charles Horton Cooley Collegiate Professor at the University of Michigan.
Schwarz has published over 20 books and about 300 journals and chapters, and is one of the most frequently referenced researchers in social psychology and consumer psychology. His focus is on how basic cognitive processes make an impact on public opinion.
Oyserman uses experimental and field-based research to explore how culture shapes individuals. She has published 130 journal articles and chapters and is currently completing a book.
“Professor Oyserman and Professor Schwarz are renowned scholars on the cutting edge of interdisciplinary work in the social sciences, providing approaches to some of society’s most challenging problems,” Garrett told USC News. “Their sophisticated research bears practical applications in a variety of settings, from the role of emotions in decision-making to the effect of identity formation on academic outcomes. Their arrival raises USC’s profile in the quantitative social sciences and will have a far-reaching impact across all disciplines and professions.”

Members of the USC medical community came together on Monday at Mayer Hall on the Health Sciences Campus to listen to Dr. Fernando Antelo discuss the medical aspects of the artwork of Frida Kahlo as part of Hispanic Heritage Month.

The event, hosted by the Latino Medical Student Association, incorporated music and an authentic Mexican lunch into the discussion of Kahlo’s paintings, which allowed attendees to view medicine through a more cultural lens.
“Monica [Melgar], our co-chair, really wanted to have an event that wasn’t just about medicine,” said Susana Sandoval, a second year medical student and the secretary of LMSA. “She didn’t want a medical talk. She wanted to incorporate some art, some Latino art.”
Antelo, a forensic pathology fellow at the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner, has conducted similar cultural and scientific presentations in several parts of the state, including at UCLA and UC San Diego.
Antelo attended Loyola High School in Los Angeles, received his bachelor’s degree at UC Berkeley, earned his medical degree at the Olive View University of California Medical Education Program and then completed his residency training in anatomic and clinical pathology at Harbor UCLA Medical Center.
Throughout his presentation, Antelo developed a sense of understanding science through artwork by going through the different body parts that Kahlo incorporates into her paintings. Some of the more notable scientific elements in her artwork include the depiction of fetuses and pain from medical abnormalities.
“I learned that Frida Kahlo actually has a significant background in science and biology and that it can be incorporated in artwork in a lot of different ways,” said Mercy Bechtold, a first year medical student.
Monica Melgar, one of the co-presidents of LMSA, saw this event as an opportunity to celebrate both Latino culture and Latinos in the medical field.
“Our E-board here at the LMSA chapter really thought it was important to get the campus community involved with just promoting our culture. Being in L.A. is such a big place to embrace that,” Melgar said. “We all felt it was important to kind of celebrate and embrace this part of our growing diversity in the medical field.”
Many non-LMSA students also attended the event.
“[We went] because when we actually were walking in, we saw the beginning of the presentation, and it looked interesting,” said Kayvon Sotoudeh, a first year medical student.
Some students said they were interested in learning about the relationship between art and science.
“I heard from someone in the hallway that he looks at her paintings and can really find interesting medical correlations to her as an artist, so I thought that was pretty cool,” said Kelli Thompson, a first year medical student.
The Kahlo talk was just one of many events LMSA hopes to put on to attract more Latino students to medical fields.
“I want to have more Latinos go into medicine and know that when they do get to medical school, they’re going to have a community to go to,” Sandoval said.
Even for the non-Latino medical community, the presentation encouraged students who did not think of themselves as artistic to appreciate an unfamiliar field.
“I think they really bring a good element of humanities and appreciation for the humanities to a more scientifically-oriented audience, and it opens up our eyes a little bit more,” Thompson said.

The USC Jet Propulsion Laboratory failed to achieve its goal to be the first university group to reach space at the BALLS convention when its rocket, named Traveler, exploded after launch on Friday.
The group said that although they haven’t yet had a successful launch, they have made extensive progress for an undergraduate team.
“We made it further than any student group has ever made it in this process,” said Sarah Cusson, a senior majoring in astronautical engineering who works in launch operations in the rocket lab.
The group plans to launch the rocket again the weekend of Oct. 18 to 20.
Cusson said the rocket’s launch made the USC Jet Propulsion Laboratory the first student group to be granted the clearance to potentially launch a rocket into space, as well as the first student group to launch a potentially space-bound rocket from the launch pad.
The motor of the rocket exploded, ripping the rocket in two when the combustion chamber was over-pressurized. The rocket lab was able to recover almost the entire vehicle, however, and easily determine what needed to be fixed, after the launch.
The group said they will remain positive despite the setback.
“In a failure, you tend to learn more than you do in a success,” said Head of Operations and Global Design Jordan Noone, a senior majoring in aerospace engineering and biophysics.
For example, Noone said they observed interesting things within the motor that are visible when it stops running mid-flight, but generally not visible before or after the flight.
Though the premature vehicle separation prevented the group from testing their recovery systems, Jordan Raice, a senior majoring in aerospace engineering, said he is excited to test the “burrito,” a contraption designed to allow the rocket to descend from space quickly without causing it to break to pieces when it hits the ground, in the next launch.
Raice is the recovery team lead and said the “burrito” is a device that involves a small parachute that allows the rocket to come down quickly from space and a larger parachute (initially wrapped up like a burrito, hence the nickname) to be released at 5,000 feet, allowing the rocket to safely land.
The rocket lab has not designed rockets intended for multiple uses, but the avionics technology the group has worked on is expensive and can be reused in future rockets.
“Really the only improvements that appear to need to be made are to the motor itself,” Raice said.
Dynamics lead John Rising, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, said the group is more excited than ever to complete Traveler.
“We know exactly what happened. We all know the design really, really well,” Rising said. “All of us really want to see it fly. Traveler has always kind of been the ‘white rocket’ in the room, the one that we’ve been just itching to get to see fly. We finally got a launch, which in itself is such a huge accomplishment.”
The rocket lab also gave students a chance to learn about the process of building and launching a rocket, even if the group did not accomplish their main goal.
“The main strength of rocket lab is that everyone is a ‘jack of all trades’ and can be a master at one, whereas in a lot of other projects at this scale, everyone just hones in on their specific trade and doesn’t really get to see the whole big picture,” Rising said. “ It’s also an excellent training ground for engineers in that sense because everyone gets exposed to everything.”

USC scientists in the Keck School of Medicine Department of Preventative Medicine were one of 14 groups that received funding to research smoking in vulnerable populations, according to the Keck School of Medicine.

The $20 million grant was given to allow the USC researchers to participate in a first-of-its-kind regulatory science tobacco program that will use the grant over five years to establish one of 14 Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science. The funding is provided by the Food and Drug Administration and through the National Institutes of Health.
The leading investigators on the project for USC are Dr. Jonathan Samet, professor and chair of preventive medicine, and Mary Ann Pentz, professor of preventive medicine and director of the Institute for Prevention Research at the Keck School of Medicine.
“There are certain things that the FDA needs to deal with under the laws, and they need the scientific basis for doing that,” Samet said. “What we do and what others do might be the basis for regulations. It might be the basis for public health campaigns. It might be the basis for thinking about how to control advertising on the Internet related to tobacco use.”
The program will research seven different aspects of smoking, from the marketing of tobacco products to the reduction of toxicity and carcinogenicity.
“The grant involves not only the School of Medicine, but other schools: [the] Pharmacy [School], Annenberg [School of Communication and Journalism], Dornsife [School of Arts, Letters and Sciences]. Other schools are involved,” Samet said. “It’s a big center and we want to reach across the campus and that was one of our strengths, to really draw on all the aspects of USC.”
Other institutions awarded TCORS grants include the American Heart Association, University of Maryland, Virginia Commonwealth University, Georgia State University, UC San Francisco, University of Vermont, University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, Penn State University, University of Texas, The Ohio State University and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, according to the press release.
“Our team put together a large application and it goes through the scientific review process and the agencies,” Samet said. “The FDA and NIH look at it carefully to decide if we were doing things relative to their mission, and were we going to do good science, and if we had done good science in the past.”
With evidence against tobacco use becoming increasingly common, students also questioned whether or not smoking should be allowed on campus.
“I think [smoking] should be allowed. I don’t smoke personally, but it is a freedom that I think people should be able to have,” said Tim Cheung, a second-year master’s in business administration student.  “I think relatively, smoking isn’t that bad in outdoor situations because particularly in L.A., there is already so much pollution.”
Some students said they do not notice a major smoking presence on USC’s campus.
“Honestly, I don’t mind because I don’t really see it,” said Brendan Plecque, a senior majoring in aerospace engineering. “If there were people smoking all over the place I would probably get kind of annoyed because I am not a very big fan of tobacco in general.”
Samet, however, said any amount of smoking is a public heath issue.
“There is already enough evidence on enough campus to see that USC ought to be able to do it. I think we and the other centers will continue to contribute,” Samet said. “The evidence on secondhand smoke, the literate issues, keeping the idea of health and that USC promotes health is really enough basis that our campus should go smoke-free. Many campuses, including urban campuses, have gone smoke-free and I hope we go in that direction.”
Samet also pointed out that people ages 18 to 26, which includes many USC students, are especially vulnerable to becoming smokers.
“We will be looking at things like what happens at points of sale, what happens over the Internet and how social media is used to create the image of tobacco and bring those images to use,” Samet said.

I can’t believe its taken the FDA this long to fund this kind of research. Glad to know we’re finally headed in the right direction.
Seriously? Wow, about time somebody studies the effects of smoking…seriously???

In the second grade, I entered an invention contest. I had a great idea in mind and wanted to introduce it to the rest of my class. That invention? The Sharpencil, a brilliant product that would always keep your pencils sharp. Take off the rose-colored glasses, however, and the Sharpencil is actually a No. 2 pencil with a mini-sharpener attached to the end of the pencil with a cheap rubber band. I still can’t figure out why, but the Sharpencil never really took off.
But when a little invention called Twitter tweeted it would be filing with the SEC for an initial public offering earlier this month, the projections for its valuation burned the house down: CNBC estimates peg it somewhere between $10 and $20 billion.
Like many startups that made it big, Twitter began with entrepreneurship. In Twitter’s case, it literally started on the notepad of founder Jack Dorsey. But Dorsey’s journey wasn’t all blue birds and billions: Entrepreneurship demands vital skills and personal values such as ambition, passion, risk-taking and foresight.
As demonstrated by the Sharpencil, however, entrepreneurship is not for everyone. For an idea or product to come together, grow and expand, a number of elements need to fall into place. Robert Leon, the vice president of sales at Venice-based startup Gravity, has seen firsthand what goes into a solid startup. I had the chance to interview him to see what goes into a successful startup, and though the following points might not apply to all entrepreneurs, they certainly wouldn’t hurt to try out.
1. Bring in people you’ve worked with before
As enticing as it might sound to bring your friends on board, it’s probably in your best interest to round up some top-notch people you’ve worked with before. Gravity was founded by Amit Kapur, the former COO at MySpace, as well as Jim Benedetto and Steve Pearman, both former senior vice presidents at MySpace.
“[Kapur, Benedetto and Pearman] are really senior guys,” Leon said. “They had a lot of respect in terms of their own abilities, and they had a really compelling vision of what they wanted to do, and it just excited people.”
2. Be open-minded about recruiting
If there are people interested in working at your startup but they don’t fit the bill for any open positions, don’t immediately turn them down. Though you weren’t actively looking for them at first, these people might have other skills and talents to offer that could eventually prove to be beneficial.
“We’ve had people who write emails — just cold emails — to the company, like, ‘Jobs at Gravity,’” Leon said. “Nick [a current Gravity employee] wrote this perfect email and he was very, very specific about what he was looking for. If they’re sales and they need to reach out cold to people, it’s all part of the job.”
3. Keep calm and work on
No startup is flawless. It’s a fact that a lot of entrepreneurs probably don’t want to admit, but every startup runs into at least a couple of issues, be they financial, organizational or otherwise.
“You have to be optimistic to almost a bizarre point because you have so many things that can go wrong,” Leon said. “You have to have this optimism to inspire people [around] you. Some people have great experience, but you also want happy warriors in startups.”
So don’t get flustered if you run into problems — solve them from a logical standpoint, learn from those mistakes and continue working.
4. Always put the user first
Putting the focus on users might seem obvious, but many startups do fail because they do not conduct focus groups or user research interviews.
“People like being advertised to well. And it’s trying to find where that line is,” Leon said. “[Gravity.com] introduces you to cool things and caters to your interests.” At Gravity, advertising — which might not seem very user-friendly in itself — is being transformed into a new experience for the user.
5. Take your time
Being one of the founders of a startup is an exciting feeling. It’s hard not to share your hot new idea with everyone around, hoping you’ll get some extra supporters (and maybe some extra cash, too). But you’ll want to slow down before actively publicizing your product. Before the publicity, Gravity’s founding team spent a couple of years making sure their product was as flawless as possible.
“They had a lot of funding, and they spent a lot of time building the tech before going to market,” Leon said. “It’s pretty cool, how they just incrementally built the core product and the engineering team first.” Unless you’re signed to a contract, there’s no real hurry. Make sure again and again that everything runs smoothly.
6. Money on the mind
It might sound greedy, but one of the most important aspects of running a successful startup is money. You could have a fantastic idea or a ton of seed funding, but at the end of the day, your product has to have some way of generating revenue.
“When you think about business models, ads are really great. If you can get adoption and distribution and if you have a really cool ad model, you can make tons of money,” Leon said. Advertisements, though a popular and proven model, aren’t always for everyone. Subscriptions, fees, add-ons and more are just some ways to help monetize a business.
7. Work hard, play hard
A startup, especially in its early development, will require a lot of time. If you find that your life and your startup are becoming synonymous, at least have some fun at it. Though Gravity is a serious company, they’re also serious about making sure employees get some downtime. Working right by Venice Beach, employees sometimes take a break by changing into their wetsuits to head over to the beach for a brief surfing session.
8. If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em
If all else fails, there’s always the chance to hop onto another startup. Because even if your grand idea does not play out as expected, you’ll at least learn a thing or two from the experience.

The glowing green lights of the newly opened TLT brighten up Downtown Los Angeles’ West 7th Street, beckoning passersby to enter and sample its California fusion cuisine first made famous by its popular mobile sibling, The Lime Truck. This is the second TLT co-founder Daniel Shemtob has opened (the first is in Westwood Village), and though it opened just a little over a week ago, it already has repeat customers thanks to a varied menu that offers carnivorous and deep-fried eats alongside gluten-free and vegetarian options.

Shemtob and his TLT team are no strangers to the limelight. After putting wheels to the ground with The Lime Truck in June 2010, they had the distinction of being named Best New Restaurant 2010 by OC Weekly. A year later, they won the second season of Food Network’s The Great Food Truck Race and then had their most popular entree, World Famous Carnitas Fries, inducted into James Cunningham’s Eat St. cookbook, which chronicles the messiest and most delicious food truck recipes in North America.
In late 2012, Shemtob decided to expand on the success of The Lime Truck by opening TLT in Westwood, transforming his food truck concept into a casual, stainless steel eatery that attracts both student and working crowds. The success of that eatery spawned the downtown location.
Many of TLT’s vegetarian and gluten-free options are light and healthy. Among them are the savory beet salad, which comes with a plethora of pickled golden beets, red beets, arugula, mint, spiced candied almonds and whipped goat cheese. “Potato Potato” is a take on the traditional American picnic potato salad that has adorable peewee potatoes, celery, fresh bell peppers, scallions, cornichons and arugula. the Asian noodle salad and the pretty wild rice salad are available in two sizes and, for a few extra dollars, can have seared ahi tuna or steak added on top.
TLT’s most vaunted feature, however, is its taco counter. The taco counter looks nothing like one found at a traditional taco shop, something that’s immediately apparent by the presence of bottles of Sriracha sauce.
There’s also this: quite a few tacos on TLT’s menu are gluten free. Classic ingredients such as shredded beef, homemade guacamole and Mexican cotija cheese, as well as a blend of unusual ingredients, such as chipotle-honey slaw and horseradish crema are part of what makes TLT’s tacos so unique.
With a variety of inimitable taco variations such as the gluten-free ultimate taco that features succulent 12-hour pulled pork, alongside the above-mentioned cotija cheese and guacamole.
Pairing one of TLT’s popular limeades with its spicy entrees is a must. Flavors vary from time to time and by location but include peachy pear, mixed berry, Mama’s Mango and galactica guava. Each different variety plays off the tartness of lime to bring out its paired flavor.
For a little TLC from TLT, try one (or both) of its two signature sweets: the light and delicious lime panna cotta and the thicker, mouthwatering “Cake.” The Italian panna cotta is made by simmering cream, milk and sugar together, mixing it with gelatin, and letting it cool until set. TLT adds essence of lime and serves the delightful mini custard with a dollop of whipped cream and a seasonal topping such as the current candied almond and walnut crumbly, making it their most popular dessert. What “The Cake” lacks in original name, it makes up for with a simple but rich flavor, taking a triple-chocolate layered cake and covering it in lime buttercream frosting.
TLT makes its presence known past sunset. In the evening, TLT partners with Silo Vodka Bar next door. Silo shares TLT’s menu with its customers, supporting both venues and spreading the word to Los Angeles nightlife.
With a motto that states, “Eat with friends, share with friends,” customers can be given the impression that portion sizes at TLT are significantly larger than average; TLT even has designated a part of their menu that has items that are meant to be shared called, “The Goods,” which has popular items such as TLT’s carnitas fries and pork belly nachos. Sharing becomes difficult when the items arrive; the portions are smaller than what one would normally call “shareable,” so those partial to a single item might have to order it for themselves.
TLT’s taco portions are similarly modest — which is great for people who want to try new things — but diners looking to take a bite out of more than a couple tacos might find that they’re also eating into their pockets. Each taco is priced from $3 for the potato taco to $5 for a seared ahi tuna taco, which is pricey considering diners might want three or four to make an honest meal. For what it costs, it’s certainly not skimping on flavor: the gluten-free and spicy seared ahi tuna taco is filled with delectable morsels of sushi-grade tuna, chipotle-honey slaw, spicy lime-sambal sauce and cilantro.
Sure, TLT might be award-winning in the food truck world, but the restaurant world judges a little differently. In Downtown Los Angeles, where the food scene is exploding and a new restaurant or concept seems to be popping up (literally or figuratively) every day, however, TLT is a more than worthy competitor.

Terry McMillan has long been known for her modern takes on the domestic drama. Works such as Waiting to Exhale and How Stella Got Her Groove Back have taken readers into complex love stories where happy endings are justified by much more than the necessities of the genre. Indeed, McMillan’s well-developed portrayals of black life have won her an NAACP Image Award and an Essence Lifetime Achievement Award for Excellence in Literature.
Who’s asking · Who Asked You? doesn’t contain a strong plot line; McMillan instead prefers to use the city as a hub for different profiles. – Courtesy of goodreads.com
Now, three years after the publication of 2010’s Getting to Happy, McMillan delivers a different sort of love story: one of self-fulfillment. Her latest novel, Who Asked You?, follows a host of characters as they struggle to find personal satisfaction in marriage, child-rearing and even just getting through high school. Rather than focusing on the typical goals of finding love or obtaining a successful career, McMillan’s characters try to “get unstuck” — that is, they try to separate themselves from the turmoil in their lives in order to achieve happiness.
Much of the novel centers around the 56-year-old Betty Jean, who takes in her two grandchildren after their drug-addicted mother disappears. Through Betty, McMillan sets up connections to characters such as Tammy, Betty Jean’s best friend and neighbor, as well as Venetia and Arlene, Betty Jean’s middle-aged sisters. There’s also Warren Daniels, the principal of the school that Betty Jean’s grandchildren attend, and Nurse Kim, a bombshell beauty who takes care of Betty Jean’s husband, Lee David. Among others, these make up the primary characters in McMillan’s eighth novel.
Admittedly, the first few chapters of Who Asked You? can get a little confusing as readers sort through the assortment of characters, but McMillan infuses each character with a distinct personality. In first-person narrative accounts, the characters share their perspectives in recognizable voices, giving readers their views on social issues, as well as their individual frustrations, with the contemporary world. Topics such as homosexuality, interracial marriage and gang warfare make their way into the characters’ commonplace conversations, adding a touch of gravity to the usual light-heartedness of a family drama. Creating such a variety of likable characters is a talent that McMillan developed as early as 1992’s Waiting to Exhale, which was divided up into chapters written from the points of view of four middle-class black women.
“I create these profiles, and then I let them tell their story,” McMillan said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. “I have, like, a little job application thing. I know their favorite color, if they’ve ever done anything they’re ashamed of, do they pay their bills on time … What are you good at? … Have you ever been in love? You ever been to jail? I mean, I know these people.”
Though Who Asked You?’s characters certainly “tell their stories,” the novel doesn’t contain much in the way of plot. Instead, readers experience the characters’ everyday lives in central Los Angeles. Even as she has a few heated moments with her sisters or confrontations with her daughter, for example, Betty Jean picks up Happy Meals for her nephews or complains about the way her husband constantly watches Dora the Explorer. The novel grounds readers into the normality of the characters’ world before skipping time to show how they grow and develop. Who Asked You? is more of a snapshot into the lives of multiple characters than a single, fast-paced narrative. The novel, in essence, shows readers just how its characters “get unstuck.”
With the bevy of characters, however, McMillan hasn’t lost her witty humor. Her ability to deliver snappy one-liners and enchant readers with her punchy prose presents itself yet again in her eighth novel.
“[Right] after I sprinkle a few drops of vinegar, a pinch of salt, sugar, and paprika and start stirring the phone rings,” Jean says as she cooks in the kitchen. “I can’t see who it is from over here but I pray it’s a telemarketer and not either of my sisters…”
Likewise, even the novel’s “secondary characters” have their own wry humor.
“I don’t know how long roofs are supposed to last but it seems like mine didn’t start leaking until I kicked my husband out a little over three years ago, after 26 years of marriage,” Tammy says in the novel, before adding: “Good thing I’m not violent or he’d be in a plot in a cemetery.”
Such authorial wit drives much of Who Asked You? Where many novels rely on a suspenseful plot to carry readers to its end, McMillan’s lively prose makes finishing her latest novel a priority.
There are moments of Who Asked You?, however, that seem a bit off-putting. Though McMillan certainly has taken risks before in works such as Disappearing Acts, the grittier details of Who Asked You? (such as the truth behind Nurse Kim’s day job) seem a tad unwarranted. Certainly literature should have the free reign to delve into whatever topic it chooses, but readers have to wonder whether or not some moments in McMillan’s latest novel are necessary for the development of the story. At the very least, however, these not-so-subtle occurrences in the book prevent the novel’s characters from falling into a cookie-cutter format.
Still, the coarser moments of Who Asked You? don’t detract from the compelling nature of its characters’ tales. As McMillan weaves political commentaries around the intricate nuances of everyday life, she creates a respectable eighth novel that readers should enjoy.
Readers might not have asked for her characters’ intimate stories, but they’re certainly glad McMillan gave them to us.
 
Terry McMillan will give a talk and reading of Who Asked You? on Friday, Sept. 27 at 6 p.m. The event will be at the Eso Won Bookstore at the Museum of African American Art on Crenshaw Boulevard.

USC played its final nonconference game of the season on Dads and Daughters Day at McAlister Field, losing 2-1 in a hard-fought battle against Cal State Fullerton on Sunday.
Fast break · USC sophomore midfielder Megan Borman scored the Women of Troy’s lone goal against Cal State Fullerton in the first minute. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
Sophomore midfielder Megan Borman scored off of a save deflection from Titan goalie Lindsey Maricic in the game’s first minute to give USC (5-3-1) an early 1-0 lead. The Titans (4-3-2) stormed back under similar circumstances, with CSUF’s Erica Mazeau getting a shot off of a save from USC junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley in the 16th minute.
“Last time we played them, we came out slow and had to work back in the second half,” Borman said. “Our mentality was to win the first five [minutes] and get behind their defense.”
Some bad blood boiled between the two teams in this match, starting with sophomore midfielder Jamie Fink picking up a yellow card off a hard slide tackle in the 22nd minute. Fullerton’s Morgan Batcheller retaliated with a hard slide tackle on sophomore forward Katie Johnson just seconds later to earn the first yellow card for Fullerton.
“I think that was their way of trying to deal with our play,” said USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin, who coached Fullerton for six seasons. “We are a very technical team. They tried to get us off of our possession, and it was effective.”
The Women of Troy continued to push their aggressive pace, hoping to overcome a very defense-focused Fullerton team that had five shutouts and had allowed just five goals scored on the season entering the game. After scoring in the game’s opening minute, the USC attack that had scored 20 goals entering the game was unable to convert on any more opportunities.
USC had some good scoring opportunities in the second half, with Borman going for a fast break in the 66th minute, forcing a corner kick for USC that it could not convert into a goal. USC had a chance for another goal off of a deflection by Maricic, but the header attempt hit the post and went out of bounds. Senior midfielder Haley Boysen also had a shot near the top of the net in the 75th minute, but Maricic had a great leaping save to keep the score tied.
Overtime produced more of the same, with neither team able to capitalize on opportunities. The Titans had a chance to put it away late in the first overtime, but a diving save by Stanley to her left kept the game going. The Titans finally broke through when Mazeau sent a corner kick into the box to Batcheller, who put it past Stanley to give the Titans a 2-1 win after more than 107 minutes of play.
“They were just packing the box and dropping numbers in, which made it difficult,” freshman defender Mandy Freeman said. “We always have problems playing against teams that like to play a lot of numbers back. We had our opportunities, and we just didn’t come away with it.”
The loss drops USC’s record to 0-2-1 in overtime, while the Titans improve to 1-0-2.
USC outshot the Titans 24-7 in the game, including 12-1 in the second half. CSUF committed 12 fouls to the USC’s 10, even though many more could have been called, as the referees chose to keep it a loose game.

The next two games are crucial ones for the fate of the USC football program.
On Saturday, the Trojans take on Arizona State in Tempe, Ariz., a place where they were beaten 43-22 two years ago by a Sun Devil team that finished 6-7 that season.
After a bye week, the team returns to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to face an Arizona squad that derailed USC’s 2012 season with a 39-36 upset win. The loss sent the Trojans into a woeful 1-5 stretch that turned last season from a disappointment into a disaster.
The revenge factor in these games notwithstanding, both are absolute must-wins for USC head coach Lane Kiffin and his team.
For one, both opponents are Pac-12 South rivals, meaning it is imperative that the Trojans win to bolster their conference record. But while winning will catapult USC back into the race for the South Division championship, fans might not want to think about what might happen should the Trojans lose one or both games.
Losing each game is not at all out of the realm of possibility, either. USC opened as 6.5-point underdogs this week against ASU, and, as previously stated, lost to Arizona in 2012. Playing the Arizona game at home should help its cause, but as USC showed against Washington State, this year’s team can lose to any team, anywhere and at any time.
Should the Trojans lose their next two games, the team will become something it hasn’t been in quite some time — irrelevant.
The 2012 season was an embarrassment, yes, but it was the sort of train wreck that caused everybody to stop what they were doing and watch in astonishment. Four of the Trojans’ last five regular season games were nationally televised, and the final regular season game against Notre Dame drew the highest TV ratings of the 2012 season.
But losing to ASU and Arizona would push USC’s conference record to 0-3, virtually erasing any chance at a Pac-12 South title. And with five of the team’s last six regular season games yet to be given a kickoff time or network broadcast, more noon kickoffs and Pac-12 Network-only broadcasts would most likely come as a result.
The low TV ratings would pale in comparison to the turnout at the Coliseum, though. The average attendance for USC’s last three home games in 2012 was 89,123. Through the first three home games this season, the Coliseum averaged just 67,770 spectators per game.
The attractiveness of USC’s opponent obviously plays a large part here. Two of USC’s last three home games of 2012 were against Oregon and Notre Dame, each extremely high-profile teams that drew sellout crowds and big TV ratings. USC’s opponents in home games this year (Washington State, Boston College and Utah State) are hardly big-name draws.
The fact remains, though, that USC’s home opener had more than 15,000 empty seats at a time when the team was unbeaten (only 1-0, but unbeaten nonetheless), ranked in the Top 25 and playing a Pac-12 opponent at 7:30 p.m., usually an attractive kickoff time for fans because it gives them ample time to tailgate and get to the stadium on time. That there were so many empty seats illustrates how critical the next two games are to ignite a spark in the team’s waning support.
I don’t mean to scare fans into a doomsday dread, because I don’t think the team will lose both games, especially with how well the defense has played thus far. In fact, I can easily envision USC winning its next two games and jumping back into the Top 25 heading into its crucial game against Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind.
But it must be said how imperative it is for the psyche of the Trojan faithful that the team perform well. It’s already been shown that one loss can send the Coliseum crowd into a tizzy, with calls for Kiffin’s job raining down from the rafters. A 0-3 Pac-12 record would make it seem like Armageddon is upon us.
It should be noted that the next two games provide an equally great opportunity for the team to prove once and for all that the loss to Washington State was more of a fluke than an indication of ineptitude, and to make a statement to the nation that USC should be taken seriously.
My money is on the latter. Call it blind faith if you want — it would be easy to, given that the Trojans’ offense has only played well in one of its four games — but I can say with confidence that I believe the team will finally put together a complete game and have its full talents on display.
Or at least I hope so. Because I really don’t want to imagine what might happen otherwise.

They say you win some and you lose some, but for the No. 1-ranked USC men’s water polo team, a loss hadn’t occurred in nearly two years. On Sunday, the Trojans got that taste of losing for the first time since Nov. 27, 2011, when they narrowly fell to crosstown rival and No. 2-ranked UCLA in the title match of the NorCal Tournament in Berkeley, Calif.
The loss breaks the Trojans’ 41-game winning streak, which was just three games short of the program record. Their last loss before Sunday’s also came to the rival Bruins in 2011 when they fell in sudden death, 10-9, in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament title match.
Tripped up · USC saw its 41-game winning streak end against UCLA despite a team-high three goals from senior utility man Mace Rapsey. – Daily Trojan file photo
 
“We are very disappointed that we did not play better,” USC head coach Jovan Vavic said. “I think our hustle and intensity wasn’t terrible. In many ways, we worked very hard, but just didn’t have a very good defensive game. We allowed UCLA to score nine goals when our goal is to average below five [goals given up]. We also allowed eight natural goals [goals when both teams are at full strength], so that was really the biggest disappointment in the game, that we made too many defensive errors.”
USC (10-1) had extended its winning streak to 41 games earlier in the day when the team snuck by No. 5 Stanford in overtime, 8-7, in the semifinal match. The game against UCLA, however, was a back-and-forth affair with no team leading by more than a single goal and eight ties throughout.
UCLA (11-0) had a one-goal lead after the first quarter before the Trojans answered back in the second to take a 6-5 lead going into halftime. USC took the lead after a goal by senior driver Nikola Vavic with just 39 seconds left in the half.
After the two teams each added a goal in the third quarter, the match hung in the balance in the fourth. The Bruins started the final frame strong with back-to-back goals to take an 8-7 lead. USC responded with an equalizing goal by junior driver Kostas Genidounias with 3:30 remaining to play.
With the game tied at 8, UCLA jumped ahead just 45 seconds later to give the Bruins the 9-8 edge that the Trojans could not overcome.
Senior utility man Mace Rapsey finished the game with three goals, while redshirt junior driver Zach Lucas added two.
The nine goals scored by UCLA were the most USC had given up since the 2012 NCAA championship game, when UCLA scored 10 goals in a game the Trojans won 11-10.
“I learned what I already knew -— that this team needs to improve on defense,” Coach Vavic said. “The players from last year who were not asked to play a major defensive role this year have to do that, and I think they are struggling with that role.”
Though the team’s defensive woes are very apparent to Vavic, it appears that improvement in that facet of the game hinges only on an attitude adjustment from the unproven players.
“In water polo, defense is all about attitude,” Vavic said. “If you have an attitude about playing defense and playing hard, you will be a good defender. I honestly think that’s our biggest issue right now — our attitude is wrong. We have to change our attitude to our defense and understand that if our attitude is there, then we’re gonna be a good team.”
Even with the loss, Vavic stresses that this is going to be beneficial down the road for the Trojans, who continue to eye their sixth consecutive national championship.
“This was a tough loss, but it could be a good loss,” Vavic said. “We’re gonna learn from it and gonna improve our defense and train harder, primarily in the classroom. We need to work harder in the classroom and recognize what we are doing wrong. We’re gonna benefit from this loss.”
Earlier in the day against Stanford, the Cardinal had a four-goal advantage midway through the fourth quarter before Genidounias and Lucas punched in late goals to send the game into overtime. Genidounias netted his third goal of the game in overtime to give the Trojans a 7-6 lead. Senior two-meter Connor Virjee also tallied a goal to put USC up 8-6 with 1:31 remaining in the overtime period.
The team had won the three previous NorCal Tournament titles prior to the loss to UCLA.
The Trojans now return to the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on campus for their home openers Saturday, where they will host Princeton and Whittier in back-to-back games. The Princeton game will begin at 10 a.m., and the Whittier game will follow at 11:30 a.m.
With games on the horizon, Vavic stressed that his team’s focus is on its next practice session.
“Right now, I’m really looking forward to our practices and not to the next opponent,” Vavic said. “I’m looking forward to fixing what we need to fix. With a few practices, I’m sure that our competitive fight is gonna be there, and we’re gonna be ready to compete the way that we have been competing for the last five years.”

Following three consecutive home games, USC hits the road this weekend, traveling to Tempe, Ariz. to face off against Arizona State. The Sun Devils dropped out of the Top 25 rankings this week after a 42-28 loss to Stanford, but pulled off the upset against Wisconsin the week before.
Tough going · USC junior wide receiver Marqise Lee and the rest of the Trojan offense have been unimpressive to start the season. Lee has 23 catches for 293 yards and one touchdown so far in 2013, well behind last year’s pace. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Deadly Devils
The Sun Devils’ offense features a number of potent offensive weapons. Quarterback Taylor Kelly is currently ranked sixth in the nation in passing yards, averaging 339.7 yards per game, while completing 59.9 percent of his attempts. Last week, the Trojans’ defense effectively shut down Utah State’s quarterback Chuckie Keeton, but Kelly has a more impressive group of receivers to rely on.
Wide receiver Jaelen Strong, standing tall at 6-foot-4, is coming off a career-high 168-yard receiving performance in the loss to Stanford, and is averaging 110 yards per game.
“This will be a matchup issue for us,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said Monday in his weekly YouTube video. “We’re gonna have to play really well with him, be very aggressive with him at the line of scrimmage and take him out of his game.”
Senior running back Marion Grice has also been effective in receiving and rushing so far this season. Through three games, he leads the nation in scoring, with 16 points per game on eight touchdowns (six rushing, two receiving).
“[Grice is] really tough to bring down for the first guy,” Kiffin said. “So we’re gonna have to tackle really well.”
Arizona State’s dynamic offense is averaging 469.3 total yards per game, which will certainly put USC’s No. 4-ranked defense to the test.
Sights on Sutton
On the defensive side of the ball, one name stands out for Arizona State: Will Sutton. The senior defensive tackle, weighing in at 305 lbs., is the reigning       Pac-12 Pat Tillman Defensive Player of the Year after helping the Sun Devils lead the country in tackles for loss per game in 2012.
This season, Sutton earned a spot on multiple preseason award watch lists, including the Chuck Bednarik Award, given to the nation’s best defensive player, and the Walter Camp Award, given to the most outstanding college player of the year.
Surprisingly enough, he has had a somewhat quiet season so far, with just nine tackles and no sacks on the season. Still, Kiffin is preparing his team for Sutton’s dominant play.
“[Sutton] just has taken over games at times,” Kiffin said. “On the road, at home, no matter where it is.”
Redshirt junior defensive end Carl Bradford, who was also named to the Bednarik Award watch list after an impressive 2012 season, has started slowly as well, allowing senior linebacker Chris Young to lead the team with 19 tackles on the season.
On the road again
After the season opener at Hawai’i, the Trojans played three consecutive games at home, but the crowd’s boos didn’t create much of a home-team advantage — Kiffin joked after the loss to Washington State that the fans’ hostility in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum prepared the players for the atmosphere on the road.
The Trojans won’t be taking this weekend’s trip to Tempe lightly, since the last time they played there, the Sun Devils handed USC one of only two losses of the 2011 season by a score of 43-22.
Kiffin emphasized the importance of preparing the players, especially the underclassmen, for the first big away game of the year.
“We’re always concerned about young players going on the road into a place like this and making sure they’re really composed and they play well,” Kiffin said. “We’ve learned over the years about young players making mistakes in their first big road games, so we’ll help those guys through the week and get our veterans to play really well around them.”

Sophomore punter Kris Albarado was named the Pac-12 special teams player of the week on Monday following a strong showing in USC’s 17-14 victory over Utah State.
Albarado averaged 35.4 yards per punt and played a key role in keeping the Aggies on their side of the field. Five of his seven attempts landed within the 20-yard line, and two of those seven pinned Utah State inside its own five-yard line. For the season, he’s averaging 40.3 yards per attempt.
Albarado is in his first year as the starting punter, replacing former All-Pac-12 honorable mention Kyle Negrete. Albarado took over the position after a high school career in which he finished with MaxPreps All-American Medium Schools second-team. He was ranked as the No. 4 kicker/punter in the class of 2011 by Rivals.com.
Other Pac-12 weekly awards went to Utah sophomore quarterback Travis Wilson, who threw for 273 yards in a 20-13 win over BYU, and Oregon State junior cornerback Steven Nelson, who had a 16-yard interception return for a touchdown in a 34-30 comeback victory against the San Diego State Aztecs.
Albarado and the rest of the Trojans will look to build on the solid special teams performance on Sep. 28 with a road matchup against the Arizona State Sun Devils. In a matchup of ranked Pac-12 teams, the Sun Devils fell to the No. 5 Stanford Cardinal on Saturday by a score of 42-28.
Last season, USC defeated Arizona State at the Coliseum by a score of 38-17. Since that victory, the Trojans have an overall record of 3-4.

Not everything in life is about winning or losing materialistic trophies. This new generation is full of people who want to be active, but not necessarily competitive. It’s full of people who want to have fun, enjoy camaraderie and focus on the social aspect of running.
As Kevin Helliker recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the college-age generation is the youngest and should be the most competitive physically, they often rank as the slowest age group in running events. While this generation might seem lacking in competitive drive, the most important thing to note is that we’re heading for a rewarding experience that lies beyond crossing the finish line first.
As Helliker sees it, the problem is that kids these days just don’t care about race times anymore, citing the rising phenomenon of untimed race events such as The Color Run and Tough Mudder. But rather than viewing this “apathy” as “emblematic of the state of America’s competitiveness,” this change is symbolic of a generation whose focus spans far beyond a number to the true heart of the matter. This new generation is redefining the meaning of sports.
Non-traditional races have taken the nation by storm since 2009, according to the industry tracking organization Running USA. From The Color Run, Color Me Rad and zombie-themed Run for Your Lives to the Tough Mudder, Diva Half Marathon and Warrior Dash, the appeal of crawling through mud, jumping off platforms into ice-cold water and running through explosions of rainbows has only grown stronger. Runner’s World reported that The Color Run has become the largest 5K event series in the nation, counting 600,000 finishers in 2012.
Helliker said that the rapidly growing interest in these events reflects a “declining competitiveness of young endurance events,” a reason he contended is “why America hasn’t won an Olympic marathon medal since 2004.” This generalized criticism is sorely mistaken.
Instead of making this a negative trend, dooming and foreboding, the silver lining should be considered — sure, this generation isn’t as hard-core as the last, but it’s brought more runners to the finish line, a feat in itself for a nation facing obesity issues; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one-third of American adults are obese.
This generation has fostered passion in more people to get out there and make running not just a race, but a lifestyle. More unathletic  people are feeling the support and accessibility to run races with professionals. More than 60 percent of the 2012 participants of The Color Run were first-time 5K runners, according to the Color Run website. As a sport, running is experiencing huge growth, with these novel racing series inspiring new athletes, Runner’s World said. This year, The Color Run anticipates 1 million runners in 120 U.S. cities and 30 countries. Running USA reported that the number of U.S. race finishers has increased 80 percent since the year 2000, and female representation has increased from only 42 percent to an all-time high of 56 percent in 2012.
Robert Johnson, a founder of LetsRun.com, also has criticized the trend of uncompetitive runs. “If you’re going to get just as much praise for doing a four-hour marathon as a three-hour, why bother killing yourself training?” Johnson asked. Johnson does not see that the participants — mostly new runners, not hard-core athletes — are simply looking for inspiration. Running is a sport about internal struggle, striving not only to beat others’ times, but one’s own — “winning” is nothing without having fun.
The Color Run website says that “the Happiest 5K on the Planet” is “less about your 10-minute mile and more about having the time of your life.” The Tough Mudder website also calls obsession over finishing times “lame.” These events have to do with things beyond competition. They are inspiring a love for running and a celebration of healthiness and happiness.

This sounds dangerously like a “we are all winners” plague in our politically correct, wussified artificial world we live in now for the super soft and wimpy and overly sensitive and weakest generation we have ever had. Generation Y hates the idea of an event that “ranks” people above other people. They want a socialistic drive towards mediocre. 
There is a reason the superbowl is so popular and why heavyweight championship tickets cost so much. As humans, we have a primal urge and curiosity to see the best against the best. The Color Run and Tough Mudder can hold their flabby events and that is fine. But let’s not conflate what they are doing as a morally superior philosophy against other competitive sports. As humans we like to keep score – and the ones who deny this can go stand in breadlines for 3 hours in any socialist countries where they share their retarded notions.

Breaking Bad, the television show infamous for its drug-infused storyline, now has its own Lego-like brick set, complete with a mini Walter White figure and his adorable goatee. Many parents are in uproar over the product, deeming it as inappropriate. But the backlash against this product is unwarranted.
Contrary to popular belief, this product isn’t even manufactured by Lego. It’s a knockoff. Citizen Brick, an independent company that mimics Lego products, produces the crystal meth lab model. Citizen Brick has no affiliation with Lego. In an interview with Wall Street  Journal, Joe Trupia, a Chicago-based artist who runs the alternative brick company, said that Citizen Brick sells Lego-type collectibles not necessarily intended for children.
Take for example its Lego S-and-M bondage figure, “Shame Enthusiast,” and “Botany Enthusiast,” a weed-devotee figure outfitted with a mini bong. These Citizen Brick figurines are clearly not marketed to children. Thus, the overreaction is uncalled for, since they are not the target audience in the first place.
The most outspoken individuals took to Twitter to vent their rage. One tweet called the product, “made for children raised by parents who should know better.” A product from a company intended for an adult audience should not be a concern to parents. A far more logical action is to simply not buy it. Parents have focused their attention in the wrong place.
The influence of media on the nation’s youth is always a subject of much concern and criticism, especially with regard to drugs and violence. Regardless of influence, the responsibility lies with the parents of these child consumers. A show such as Breaking Bad is perhaps not the best choice for family bonding night. Instead of the protest over the distribution of this product, parents must take responsibility for ensuring their children are surrounded with positive influences. Children should not be watching a show like Breaking Bad to begin with, let alone be so invested as to buy a play set based on the series.
The truly shocking aspect of the whole debacle is the price of the brick set itself. With 500 pieces, this set is priced at $250. Comparatively speaking, this is actually an inexpensive set. Some Harry Potter Lego sets sell for $400 or more depending on their rarity. These are not merely toys; there is a fine line between toys and art. The Citizen Brick set clearly fits into the latter.
Following a series conclusion, the best television shows become timeless pieces of our collective culture. With Breaking Bad nearing its season finale, the Citizen Brick item has sold out completely, leaving the company taking orders for future production. The most die-hard Breaking Bad fans have every right to purchase a product based on their favorite show.
Lego bricks have been around since 1949. Since then, Lego’s customer base has grown to include more than just kids. Legos are enjoyed by all ages. Most of the adult-friendly interest in Lego is geared toward art and architecture. Tons of M.C. Escher’s work have been recreated using Lego. There is also a line of Lego Architecture, which allows consumers to recreate famous, complex structures using the tiny bricks, such as Frank Lloyd Wright’s Falling Water. It is clear that Lego itself is not solely a toy for one age demographic.
Despite the criticisms, Citizen Brick remains rightfully undeterred. As Trupia said to the Wall Street Journal, “You’d have to be a pretty precocious kid to build your own meth lab after playing with our set.”

With Shaka King’s feature-length directorial debut, Newlyweeds follows the journey of a marijuana-reliant couple who are struggling to get by in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  The gritty comedy may not be one of the most humorous stoner films, but its weighty subject matter provides an important contrast of the experience and consequence of getting high to the other marijuana films that oversaturate the industry.

The film follows the lives of Lyle (Amari Cheatom) and Nina (Trae Harris), a young couple whose overwhelming love and devotion for each other seems to be overshadowed only by marijuana.  Lyle laments through his day as a repo-man, a thankless job where he is forced to watch the suffering that his job causes, and the only way that he can cope with his life is recreational marijuana usage.  His day-to-day lifestyle clashes with Nina’s hopes for a better future.  She wants to save up money in order to go out and travel the world, which Lyle shows reluctance for.  He lives on a day-by-day basis, and does not seem to have any dreams for his future.
This ultimately proves to be a point of conflict in their lives. Marijuana ends up playing a major role in both their relationships and their life decisions. But their addiction to weed gets them into a lot of trouble, and they struggle to keep their relationship as a result.  Cheatom and Harris do a stellar job of portraying this subtle and nuanced struggle with marijuana addiction.  But those looking for a nice romantic comedy should not get too excited: this film focuses on marijuana, not their love.  It explores how marijuana addiction affects personal relationships, not the strength of love despite all obstacles.
Newlyweeds does not take the more conventional path of movies that focus on marijuana.  Stoner comedies too often are over the top in order to give out cheap laughs.  It is a much more realistic portrayal of recreational marijuana usage.  These characters are not simply getting high and getting caught up in some crazy scenarios.  Rather, they smoke in order to escape from their lives.  After Lyle gets punched by a man who is upset that Lyle is taking away his grandmother’s refrigerator, all he wants is to relax by getting high.  This is a refreshing change of pace from movies like Pineapple Express, which implement a lot of exaggeration and absurd situations for comedic effect.
While Newlyweeds portrays a more realistic usage of marijuana, the film  is a much more mature type of comedy.  The tone of the movie is so serious that it would seem almost out of place to categorize it as a comedy.  The film is not particularly humorous, but perhaps that is for the better.  The scenes that depict the characters when they are high seem blasé, lacking originality or the audacity of a film like Pineapple Express.  But if these scenes were that gaudy, they would have just seemed out of the place in the world of this film.  One of the more humorous points of the film is where Lyle and his coworker, Jackie (Tone Tank), are arguing about whether marijuana or alcohol is worse for the body.  Yet this scene is short and does not really hit home.  It may just seem tough to laugh at these people when you see how their lives are practically falling apart as a result of their addictions to marijuana.  As a result, the subject matter just does not allow itself be comedic.  It would be better off being considered a drama with moments of comedic matter.
Both major players give a greater depth to the story by making their relationship with marijuana grittier and more realistic.  They play characters that rely on weed to get through the day, not just for fun.  Their performances, both individually and together, are intense and emotional.  They demonstrate how marijuana both unites their characters and also causes the rifts in their relationship.  Harris, in her acting debut, plays with a subtly of a much more experienced actress.  She capably shows both Nina’s love for Lyle and her struggle to continue on with his lifestyle.  Her and Cheatom, who recently had a role in Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained, play off each other with great chemistry.  They are also supported by great supporting roles by Isiah Whitlock Jr. and Hassan Johnson, both of whom are Wire alum.  Tone Tank also does a great job as Jackie, Lyle’s friend who also struggles with drug problems but does not seem to resist as much.  The cast overall does a wonderful job of demonstrating marijuana use in a realistic light.
Even if the humor is lacking, Shaka King does a wonderful job writing and directing his first feature length film.  The characters and plot are all well fleshed out, and they merge seamlessly into this depiction of Brooklyn.  The cinematography truly makes a chillingly beautiful picture out of Bedford-Stuyvesant, a lower class urban neighborhood.  Even though he tackles drug addiction in an urban setting, it is not in a dismal or depressing manner.  The film’s honesty shows the issue for what it really is, and that is a social issue.  Newlyweeds delves a lot deeper into the issue of marijuana use than most stoner comedies and comes out as a stronger film for it.

USC played its final non-conference game of the season on Dads and Daughters Day at McAlister Field, losing 2-1 in double overtime in a hard-fought battle against Cal State Fullerton on Sunday.
Sophomore midfielder Megan Borman started the scoring early, scoring off of a save deflection from Titan goalie Lindsey Maricic in the game’s first minute to give USC (5-3-1) an early 1-0 lead. The Titans (4-3-2) stormed back under similar circumstances, with Erica Mazeau getting a shot off of a save from junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley, tying the game in the 16th minute.
“The last time we played them, we came out slow and had to work back in the second half,” Borman said. “Our mentality was to win the first five [minutes] and get behind their defense.”
Some bad blood boiled between the two teams in this match, starting with sophomore midfielder Jamie Fink picking up a yellow card off a hard slide tackle in the 22nd minute. Cal State Fullerton’s Morgan Batcheller retaliated with a hard slide tackle on sophomore forward Katie Johnson just seconds later to earn the first yellow card for Cal State Fullerton.
“I think that was their way of trying to deal with our play,” USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin, who coached at Cal State Fullerton for six seasons, said. “We are a very technical team. They tried to get us off of our possession, and it was effective.”
The Women of Troy continued to push their aggressive pace, hoping to overcome a very defense-focused Cal State Fullerton team that had five shutouts and had allowed just five goals scored on the season entering the game. After scoring shortly after the opening whistle, the USC attack that had scored 20 goals entering the game was unable to convert on any more opportunities.
USC had a some good scoring opportunities in the second half, with Borman going for a fast break in the 66th minute, forcing a corner kick for USC that it could not convert into a goal. USC had a chance for another goal off of a deflection by Maricic, but the header attempt hit the post and went out of bounds. Boysen also had a shot near the top of the net in the 75th minute, but Maricic had a great leaping save to keep the score tied.
Overtime produced more of the same, with neither team able to capitalize on opportunities. The Titans had a strong chance to put it away late in the first overtime, but a diving save by junior goalie Caroline Stanley to her left kept the game going. The Titans finally broke through when Mazeau sent a corner kick into the box to Batcheller, who put it past Stanley to give the Titans a 2-1 win after over 107 minutes of play.
“They were just packing the box and dropping numbers in, which made it difficult,” freshman defender Mandy Freeman said. “We always have problems playing against teams that like to play a lot of numbers back. We had our opportunities, and we just didn’t come away with it.”
The loss drops USC’s record to 0-2-1 in overtime, while the Titans improve to 1-0-2.
USC outshot the Titans 23-6 in the game, including 12-1 in the second half. The Titans committed 12 fouls to the Women of Troy’s 10, even though many more could have been called, as the referees chose to call a loose game.
USC will begin its Pac-12 schedule next weekend as they head to Tempe, Ariz. to take on Arizona State (5-3-0) on Sunday, Sept. 29. The Women of Troy will return to McAlister Field the following weekend for games against Washington (4-4-0) on Friday, Oct. 4 and Washington State (6-0-2) on Sunday, Oct. 6.
Three Stars
Third Star: Jordan Marada (Six shots, two on goal)
Senior midfielder Jordan Marada was a key player for USC attack, leading the team in shots and tying for most shots on goal. She helped keep up the fast pace the Women of Troy have kept up all season, and provided many scoring opportunities.
Second Star: Mandy Freeman (played all 107:17 of game-time)
While Freeman didn’t accumulate any goals or assists, she proved to be an invaluable asset on defense. Freeman played the entire game, keeping the Titans from earning additional scoring opportunities and helping make things easier for Stanley.
First Star: Megan Borman (One goal, three shots, two on goal)
Borman was the only player able to convert on USC’s many scoring chances, netting the team’s only goal of the game in the first minute. Despite USC not being able to pick up any additional goals after that, Borman helped push through the Titan defense, doing what she could to create scoring chances and tying Marada for most shots on goal.
