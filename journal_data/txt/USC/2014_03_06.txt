Students gathered at Tommy Trojan Thursday night for Survivor Speak OUT, an event that gave students who have survived sexual violence an opportunity to share their stories in a safe space.

The event served as the culminating event of Take Back the Week, a weeklong effort by the Women’s Student Assembly to raise awareness about sexual violence. Take Back the Week included the Clothesline Project; on Alumni Park, a night of “artivism” at Ground Zero and other panels and workshops concerning issues of sexual violence.
Survivor Speak OUT opened with introductions of several student services, including the counseling services offered by the Engemann Student Health Center.
The event featured a keynote address from award-winning poet and activist Andrea Gibson, introduced by Take Back the Night director Yesenia Menendez as someone who “is not gentle with her truths.”
Gibson’s performance was very powerful. She performed several potent spoken-word poems and provided encouraging words to the audience.
“Even if you don’t write poems, I really recommend writing a love poem to your body,” Gibson said as an introduction to her poem, “I Sing the Body Electric, Especially When My Power’s Out.”
After Gibson’s performance, the stage was opened up to survivors of sexual violence who were given the opportunity to share their stories. Several survivors took to the stage, sharing poems, stories and emotional outpourings to a supportive audience. Everyone in the audience held lighted candles throughout the Speak OUT.
The event attracted several dozen attendees.
“I’m interested in hearing what survivors have to say,” said Lilly Taing, a sophomore majoring in health and humanity. “A lot of people can’t or don’t understand how [survivors] are feeling or dealing with their situation, and a lot of time people blame [the survivors].”
Many survivors and supporters at the event advocated against victim-blaming, and created an encouraging environment for those who might blame themselves for the violence that had been committed against them.
Maggie Deagon, a sophomore majoring in Spanish and health and humanity, noted these events are important for bringing awareness to sexual assault.
“Events like this start a conversation about issues people might not be talking about otherwise,” Deagon said.
Taing agreed that the event brought important coverage toward the issue.
“Especially in front of Tommy Trojan, the center of campus, I think this event could cause students to take notice,” Taing said.
Indeed, several passersby stopped to see why a crowd had gathered around Tommy Trojan, and found a strong audience of people supporting one another.
After Speak OUT, the audience rose to walk together around campus with their lighted candles, letting their light take back the night from all the perpetrators of sexual assault.

Wow! This show is so great! I felt like I was able to sit in on an amazing conversation with two changemakers. This episode was an important reminder of how students of color aren’t taught their history and need to make the time to talk to elders and learn the historical context of our communities. Thanks so much to Joan Mulholland and Corliss Bennett-McBride for taking the time to share the important stories of the struggle.
And big thanks to Jordyn for making this show! I have class during the show, but I’m so grateful for this accessible podcast. Also great choices on songs! Looking forward to the rest of this series!

After Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti signs a measure passed by the Los Angeles City Council, students on campus will no longer be able to smoke electronic cigarettes indoors.
According to the Washington Post, smoking decreased by 42 percent for women and 25 percent for men between 1980 and 2012. Former and non-smokers alike, however, have found solace in e-cigarettes, battery-powered devices that simulate smoking and have been promoted by e-cigarette companies as a safer alternative to other tobacco products.
The industry suffered a blow on Tuesday when City Council officials voted to treat e-cigarettes like regular cigarettes — essentially banning their use in parks, restaurants, nightclubs and most workplaces.
Students on campus have been split on the issue, with many questioning a lack of scientific data warranting such a ban.
“I don’t see a good reason as to why this would be banned from public areas and indoor spaces,” said Timmy Kang, a senior majoring in occupational therapy. “Honestly, there needs to be more research done on the side effects of both vaping and inhaling the secondhand smoke generated by e-cigarettes.”
The use of e-cigarettes is known as “vaping” as the devices emit water vapor rather than the smoke of traditional tobacco products.
Los Angeles is joining a growing number of cities and states that treat e-cigarettes the same as cigarettes. The District of Columbia and five states already include e-cigarettes in their      anti-smoking bans, and New York City and Chicago have also recently moved to do the same.
A common argument against smoking cigarettes in public spaces is secondhand smoke, an issue that has students divided on the effects of e-cigarettes vapor.
“I think [the ban] is kind of stupid, because if it doesn’t cause secondhand smoke issues then there’s no point in banning it in indoor places,” said Joo Lee, a freshman majoring in human biology. “Without solid research, there is really no reason to ban it.”
The practice of using e-cigarettes has gained recent popularity amongst many young adults in past years. Some students, however, are welcoming the ban.
“I think that this ban is justified,” said Jay Won, a freshman majoring in business administration. “Even though we don’t know if the secondhand smoke is really as bad as the secondhand smoke from regular cigarettes because of a lack of research, the act of smoking an e-cigarette generates a perception amongst younger kids that it’s socially acceptable.”
This is exactly what many health professionals are worried           about — the destigmatization of the act of smoking.
“We don’t want to risk e-cigarettes undermining a half-century of successful tobacco control,” Director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Jonathan Fielding told the Los Angeles Times.
Irene Kim, an undecided freshman, believes e-cigarettes might bring cigarettes back into vogue.
“Vaping has really gained popularity amongst middle and high school kids, and I don’t think it’s good to foster a new generation of smokers,” Kim said.
The new ordinance is expected to be implemented in the coming weeks and will be banned from most indoor spaces, except for vaping lounges. Fines will range from $100 to $500.
“We don’t want more people to become addicted to smoking,” said Philip Ahn, a freshman majoring in history. “Even though there may be those who use it to stop a bad smoking habit, there have to be some who become addicted to smoking because of e-cigarettes.”
Washington loves to regulate, healthcare, e-cigs, etc. What’s next? How many aquares of toilet paper we use?
Smoking and Alcohol kill hundreds of thousands a year. Good! World is overcrowded! Too bad they suck all the money up in the hospital!
This story is ridiculous! E cigs are not gonna cause people to start smoking. It is quite the opposite! Regular cigs are what is harmful. Why would anyone start smoking regular cigs that are far more harmful and toxic? Not to mention way more expensive. This ecig ban is all about the government and the taxes they will no longer get because people have an alternative. Now that people have found another way, they want to take that away too. All because they’re not making money from the sales.
Pamela I agree with you on every point except for the “Not to mention way more expensive” in regards to that…I can tell you first hand, the out of pocket cost when I smoked analog cigs was much cheaper than my current e cigarette choice. Rebuilding, DIY juice and the gotta have all the new APV’s that come out adds up quite fast!
–Troy
I agree, Pamela. They talk about the destigmatization of smoking, when it is not smoking. It is the preferred method of nicotine intake, which is what is at the core of this.  There has been some kind of assumed quantum leap that people are using e-cigs as a gateway from or away from smoking as a nicotine addiction. Nothing could be further from the truth in most cases. People who enjoy nicotine don’t see it as a harmful addiction, rather something to be enjoyed.

Walking down Trousdale Parkway, USC students might soon be noticing some new sartorial choices — but not from their classmates.
On Wednesday, Department of Public Safety officers debuted their new, blue, uniforms.
The blues · (Left to right): Deputy Chief David Carlisle, Chief John Thomas, Sergeant Leesa Sandell and Captain Ed Palmer don their new uniforms. The latest editions are a drastic departure from the department’s previous tan, beige and green outfits and will provide DPS officers with a sense of uniformity. Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
“Six o’clock this morning was the rollout for our day one shift beginning today, and we are pretty excited about the look,” said DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle.
The motivation behind the change from tan to blue uniforms is to have DPS look more like other law enforcement, Carlisle said. Los Angeles Police Department officers wear blue uniforms, as do university officers at UCLA and California State University, Northridge.
“We think it may be more contemporary, maybe even a more professional look, though I did like our old uniforms also,” Carlisle said.
With this, however, comes a separate issue: students might mistake DPS officers for LAPD.
“People say, ‘Well, it looks a lot like LAPD’ and, yes, we were very concerned with that, but one distinction students should realize is our uniform has a patch,” Thomas said. “LAPD doesn’t have a patch.”
Another issue with the old uniforms was suppliers. DPS Chief John Thomas said that not only did the old suppliers underestimate DPS’ needs, but since multiple brands were authorized, the uniforms ended up being different shades of tan.
“When you put us all together it did not look uniform, and the purpose of wearing a uniform is uniformity,” Thomas said.
In addition to the uniform, the department will also be changing the patch they wear on their sleeves. Previously, the patch only identified DPS officers as part of the University of Southern California. Now they will also specify each officer’s department.
“I wanted something that specifically said ‘Department of Public Safety,’” Thomas said. “It was important to me that when people saw our uniform they knew we were a department. There’s nothing wrong with the university seal, but most public safety agencies — be it campus or municipal — have a unique patch that says department or what they’re affiliated with.”
Within DPS, there are two types of officers. Public safety officers, of which Carlisle said 115 are academy-trained, carry weapons and have the power to arrest. Community service officers, of which there are 147 authorized positions, are not academy-trained and act more as security officers who observe and report incidents around campus.
The public safety officers will be the ones now wearing blue uniforms, while community service officers will remain in tan uniforms. Both groups chose which uniforms they would wear among themselves.
“We put it out for a vote, so the officers had to vote as to what they wanted to do,” Thomas said. “It was exactly four [public safety] officers that did not want to change uniform, so it was pretty unanimous.”
Community service officers also had the option of switching to new uniforms which were slightly different ones with a light blue shirt, but decided against it.
“We wanted to distinguish between the public safety      officers — the academy-trained officers — and the officers who are community officers,” Carlisle said.
Carlisle and Thomas were both excited about the new change, though Thomas said had the decision been solely in his hands, it might have turned out a little differently.
“My taste is a little                             unique … They’re not as creative as I am,” he said. “My uniform would be … trust me, it would be a little bit different.”
Carlisle, on the other hand, seemed glad it was a slightly more democratic process.
“Thank God rational minds prevail,” he joked.
Carlisle, who worked in municipal law enforcement for 30 years before coming to USC, was excited for other reasons as well.
“When I started seven years ago, it was odd for me to wear tan and green, so I kind of like going back to my roots in blue,” he said. “It’s traditional police officer, law enforcement … and [for] some of us, like me, it makes us look thinner.”

After the No. 2 BYU Cougars broke their four-game winning streak, the No. 7 USC men’s volleyball team looks to get back on track with a win against Pacific tonight at 7 p.m. in the Galen Center. USC fell to 10-6 overall and 9-6 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play after the Cougars swept the Trojans, 22-25, 16-25, 21-25.
Block party · Senior outside hitter Maddison McKibbin has totaled 16 blocks so far this season, good for an average of 0.40 blocks per set. Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
USC began the match with a 14-11 lead in the first set, though they couldn’t stop the Cougars’ late run and dropped the first set 22-25. The Cougars hit .519 in the second set and had a 7-0 run to hold off the Trojans and win the second set 25-16. In the third set, the Trojans managed to come back from an early deficit and tie the game at 19 apiece, though they failed to hold off the Cougars and lost the third set 21-25.
“The first and third sets were close, we were right with them and that’s what we came away with,” said head coach Bill Ferguson. “As disappointed as we were with some aspects of the match, we still had the capability of extending that match and playing better and feeling like we’re capable of playing with and beating the best teams in the country.”
Freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder led the Trojans with 12 kills and senior opposite outside hitter Maddison McKibbin added 11. Junior setter Micah Christenson had a match-best 10 digs in the Trojans’ second loss of the season to BYU.
The Trojans are looking to bounce back against the Pacific Tigers, which based on the numbers might not be a very difficult task.
The ailing Tigers are 2-15 overall and 1-11 in MPSF play and sit in 12th place in the conference rankings, just one spot from the bottom. Only winless UC San Diego stands between the Tigers and the conference cellar. Pacific’s only wins this season have come against Cal State Northridge and UC San Diego, and they are looking to snap a six-game losing streak tonight. The Tigers have only won one set during the six-game skid, and have only taken eight out of a total 59 sets played this season. Still, the team looked slightly improved in its loss to No. 3 Long Beach State last week. The 49ers were tested in every set, pulling out a 25-15, 25-19, 25-18 victory.
The Trojans know they can’t let their guard down on defense, though, since on Jan. 24 they were upset 3-0 by the unranked Northridge team that Pacific defeated to open up its season.
“We’ve had a great week of practice working on defense and converting on high balls, so we should be able to pick it up this weekend,” freshman middle blocker Andy Benesh said.
USC will have to gear up on defense for the Tigers’ Thomas Hodges and Christian Franceschi, who average 3.15 and 2.56 kills per set, respectively. Defensive weapons for Pacific include Javier Caceres and Marco Grasso, who have combined for 218 digs so far this season.
Tonight’s match against Pacific is the first of two home conference matches this weekend for the Trojans, as they host No. 10 Stanford on Sunday at 5 p.m. in the Galen Center.
The Cardinal (10-7, 6-3) are led by Brian Cook, who averages 3.57 kills per set, and James Shaw, who averages 10.78 assists per set. Stanford comes into the match in the ninth spot in the MPSF rankings. The team will try to build off a win against Cal State Northridge last Saturday during a SoCal swing that includes a matchup with Pepperdine tomorrow night.
This weekend’s games will provide a peek at two conference opponents that the Trojans will hit the road to face again at the end of the month.
“They’re both good teams and we’re gonna try to serve the ball tough, get them out of their system and play better volleyball on our side of the net, because it really comes down to what we do,” Yoder said.
Looking  ahead, the Trojans will tangle with No. 7 UCSB next Wednesday before taking on No. 5 UCLA three days later.

The grass is green, the birds are chirping and the SoCal temperature is starting to consistently hit 70 degrees, which can only mean one thing: spring is here.
A Sark contrast · New head coach Steve Sarkisian will have to find new ways to create hype around USC football after a tumultuous 2013. Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
As those of us of Iranian descent might know, the beginning of spring is celebrated in Persian culture to ring in the New Year in a 13-day day festival called Nowruz, which celebrates new beginnings.
The holiday not only commemorates the end of winter, but also signifies that I don’t have to watch the atrocious USC men’s basketball team play another game until next fall after a rough first campaign for head coach Andy Enfield.
More importantly, the coming of spring means that spring football is on the horizon — and for USC, the road to the Trojans’ Aug. 30 opener against Fresno State at the Coliseum starts on Tuesday.
When the team takes Howard Jones Field to practice on Tuesday, their cleat indents on the luscious, green grass will not only be the beginning of a long journey, but will also signify a sense of renewal for the Trojans.
And after enduring a season that featured three different head coaches, an embarrassing home loss to Washington State and a pair of defeats to rivals UCLA and Notre Dame, the team can now get the fresh start they have been seeking for quite some time.
It all started with Sarkisian’s Signing Day magic, when he captured the Pac-12’s top recruiting class. Now it’s time to churn that momentum onto the playing field.
Spring marks new beginnings for the team with a new coaching staff, new players and a clean slate featuring questions surrounding the team’s future.
Perhaps the most interesting story going into spring ball is who will be the starting quarterback on the depth chart come April.
Will the chick — redshirt freshman Max Browne — hatch from his egg this spring or will Cody Kessler continue to fly like the phoenix that landed him the starting job over Max Wittek last spring?
Kessler, the incumbent, holds a slight advantage over Browne after throwing for just under 3,000 yards and 20 touchdowns last fall. He got the job done last season and brings back experience, though the talent and throwing arm of Browne is continuously praised.
Sarkisian knows what Browne can do, having recruited him out of Skyline High School in Washington, and I’m excited to see how he and Kessler split reps during practice and duel during the spring game.
But a question that arises every spring is which players are going to fill in the team’s holes?
The Trojans return 18 starters: eight on offense, eight on defense and two on special teams, but they lost pretty important players at fairly important positions. Now that wide receiver Marqise Lee is gone, Nelson Agholor will step into his role as the number one receiver and Darreus Rogers will likely complement him on the outside.
As position battles ensue, Sark needs to replace the heart of the offensive line, as center Marcus Martin and tackle Kevin Graf head to the draft. He has a good bunch of talent to choose from, especially with the incoming recruiting class which includes early enrollee Toa Lobendahn.
Lobendahn will be sporting the No. 55 jersey of late Trojan Junior Seau, which makes the prestigious No. 55 a two-way number (LB Lamar Dawson will also wear No. 55) after it historically only went to linebackers. If the coaches didn’t have high expectations for the freshman, they probably wouldn’t let that happen.
What I’m really curious about, however, is how Sarkisian will be able to hype up the team during the spring, which isn’t easy when the season lies so far ahead. Hopefully, he doesn’t come up with a motto like “Don’t talk about it, be about it” on the field, the Lane Kiffin slogan that didn’t really inspire anyone. Maybe he’ll bring the team cookies, In and out or chicken and waffles like Coach O did during his tenure.
Fortunately for Sark, the best part about the spring, a time of freshness, is that he can “be about” anything he wants, start his own traditions and produce his own one-liners to get his team going.
Whether you want to hear Sark’s words of wisdom or just want to catch the team in action this spring, anyone is welcome to get their fix of USC spring ball in person from the deck of Dedeaux Field, which overlooks Howard Jones Field.
With the early success of the Trojans’ baseball team, USC fans can now really get a bang for their buck by experiencing quite the doubleheader beginning with spring football practice followed by a USC baseball game.
Spring cleaning is boring — so I advise you to take a break, put on some shades, and head out to a practice or two. From previous experience, you never know who you will see — Detroit Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh showed up to speak to the team last spring.
So take advantage of the opportunity. Oh, and Pro Day is next Wednesday, another event signifying new beginnings for the Trojans’ NFL-bound athletes.
This is why the spring is my favorite season at USC: Unlike the words of Rachel Carson, it’s no “silent spring” here. There’s always something going on.
The only thing better than spring time on campus is when the Trojans get back to the playing field on Saturdays in the fall — and I’m sure that we are all looking forward to that. Until then, enjoy the spring green.

Junior guard Ariya Crook led the charge as the No. 5 seed Women of Troy (19-12, 11-7 Pac-12) scored a 59-54 win over the Arizona Wildcats (5-25, 1-17) in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament. The success continues for USC after finishing off the regular season with one of its best Pac-12 records ever. 
Coming up big · A suffocating Arizona defense held senior All-Pac-12 forward Cassie Harberts to just six points, allowing junior guard Ariya Crook to step up with a 19-point effort. Crook is averaging 15.8 points per game. Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
First-year head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke’s preparation was on display as the Women of Troy executed well, especially defensively.
The win was a collaborative effort, as Crook scored 19 points while senior forward Cassie Harberts and junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama each added six.  Harberts and Vaioletama also tag-teamed to rack up the boards, collecting 11 and 12, respectively. The duo came away with eight combined offensive rebounds in the game. The frontcourt mates each nearly doubled their rebounding averages — Harberts has led USC with 7.6 boards per game this season while Vaioletama has added 7.3. Sophomore guard Brianna Barret led the team in assists with four.
The Women of Troy started the game strong, with three different USC players scoring the game’s six points. This spreading of the wealth would be a theme all day. Four of the team’s players would contribute five or more points in the game, though only Crook reached double figures.
USC would hold its lead until just four minutes remained in the half, when Arizona guard Carissa Crutchfield nailed a three-pointer to put the Wildcats ahead 22-21. The game would be close the rest of the way.
Coming from behind after Arizona jumped out to a five-point halftime lead, USC senior forward Kate Oliver led the charge in the final 20 minutes. One of USC’s tallest players at 6-foot-4, the reserve provided a necessary spark by making her first six shots off the bench. Oliver ended the afternoon with 12 points, well above her season average of 1.8.
The Women of Troy kept within a basket of their opponents for a much of the half, but finally turned the tide at the 12-minute mark with Harberts’ jumper that gave them a 39-38 lead.
Still, it was defense that made the difference for USC. The Wildcats couldn’t manage a basket for nearly five minutes in the latter part of the half, staying put at 49 points from the 7:41 mark until just 2:22 was left in the game. To 12th-seeded Arizona’s credit, there was plenty of defense from both teams. The Wildcats kept themselves very much in the game until the final minutes, when a trio of Crook free throws finally put the contest out of reach.
It was a rarely unproductive day on the offensive end for Harberts. The two-time All-Pac-12 forward was held under 10 points against the Wildcats for the second time this season. Harberts, who will go down in USC history as one of the school’s best women’s basketball players, is highly ranked in various categories for her dynamic playing style. She became one of the school’s top-10 all-time leading scorers this season.
Breaking school records is not the only history the Women of Troy are making this season. If the USC wins its next game and fails to make the NCAA Tournament, they will go down in conference history as the only team that has won 20 games in a season and failed to earn a bid to the tournament.
Even if the team fails to make the big dance, the team has certainly shown improvement. This time last year, the Women of Troy were just the No. 7 seed in the Pac-12 Tournament. If the Women of Troy come out of the Pac-12 Tournament as champions, they will be assured a spot in the tournament for the first time since 2006.
The Women of Troy will now advance to the second round of the Pac-12 Tournament, hoping to sweep the Arizona schools. Fourth-seeded Arizona State (22-8, 11-7), the team’s next opponent, will be a difficult obstacle. The Sun Devils defeated USC in overtime earlier this year, the Women of Troy’s only loss in a stretch of eight midseason games.  If USC can survive this game, a potential date with No. 4 Stanford awaits. The Cardinal, the tournament’s No. 1 seed, face ninth-seeded Colorado tomorrow after their first-round bye.

Analyzing the loss of a child can be difficult for anyone, particularly for a group of people who have never had children of their own. A group of students tackle that feat this weekend with Living Creatures, a new original play written by first year MFA student Ashley Rose Wellman. 
Wellman said her new play was inspired by a dream and much of the play takes on a very dream-like quality. Though it starts off realistically, the plot gets more and more strange; words become poetry and the line between reality and fiction becomes blurred.
The show opens with a rhetorical monologue by Julie (Sohina Sidhu), a mother who believes that “houses built after 1980 are sh-t.” She craves ghosts and history in her own house, but she quickly learns you must be careful what you wish for. After she and her husband, Kevin (Austin Humble), lose their son, Luke (Michael Lyons), when he eats too many crabcakes (due to his allergy), the two must struggle to come to terms with both their loss and reality. Julie takes a trip to the “other world” to find her son and ends up meeting some of the very ghosts she asked for days earlier.
The imaginative nature of the play couples nicely with the technical aspects of the show, with empty wall frames filled with bare-bulb lights serving as dramatic decoration. The lighting design by Alex Underwood is beautiful and complements the moody nature of the show. It works particularly well when separating the various levels of reality throughout the show, both cluing in the audience that this isn’t real, but still leaving it up to interpretation.
Sound also plays a major role in this production. The sounds of crashing waves and underwater gurgling provide an intriguing soundtrack, as well as the eerie, echoing voices of desperate lost souls. The voices of the actors themselves also contribute, and some scenes feel like musical numbers, only without actual music. When the three family members describe a trip to the beach, accompanied by the sounds of an empty beach, the rhythm of their voices even matches the ebb and flow of the water. It creates a completely serene moment, echoing the sentiment of the dialogue. The peacefulness is only truly appreciated when it is shattered soon after.
These artistic, inventive moments are what make this play so intriguing, and can no doubt be attributed to director and USC alumnus Jonathan Muñoz-Proulx. There are many periods when the actors, writing and technical elements weave together seamlessly. Sometimes the occurrences are so small that one might not even notice them, such as when Kevin and Julie sit down in chairs on opposite sides of the stage at the exact same time, while both sighing. It may seen insignificant, but it adds to the mythical feel of the play.
Despite these wonderful elements, it is by no means a perfect play or a perfect performance. The play lacks emotion, especially in the first half. It almost feels as though Luke has been dead for weeks or months, rather than mere hours, based on how his parents seem to be handling it. Both Sidhu and Humble have some wonderful moments throughout the play, particularly during the final scene. But at times, the sadness seems forced, and it is difficult to believe these two were parents to a child they loved. In their defense, they are roles beyond their age and experience, but they each could have gone further.
Another unfortunate casting situation is Lyon as Luke, their 10-year-old son. Lyon does a commendable job of portraying a 10-year-old; his speech is slowed and slightly slurred, and he scurries around in the air of a child; but at the end of the day, his height and his age (double that of his character) are difficult to ignore. It is unclear how old Luke is actually supposed to be until the second act, when it is finally revealed. Wardrobe unfortunately does not help the issue, and he seems to sometimes bounce between ages 6, 12 and 20. It seems this play would benefit from more age-appropriate casting, but this technique did not completely fail outright.
Though he is the last character to appear, Mr. Thermond (Caspar Brun), a resident of the “other world,” is the most memorable. Lurking barefoot in a suit complete with a bolo tie, a ponytail and haunting makeup, it is difficult to look away. His drawling Southern accent paired with the distinctive look makes him both charming and creepy. Acting as a sort of “spiritual guide” for Julie, he gives the play a very dark edge — something about him is just not right. His influence makes the inconclusive ending that much more thought-provoking.
Living Creatures is an incredibly imaginative and creative play that bravely tackles a difficult subject with innovation and poetry. Though still a bit rough around the edges, it is very enjoyable as a work of art and an exploration of emotions.
Living Creatures runs through Sunday, March 9 at the Massman Theatre.

As a journalist, I’m constantly being told that my future is dismal. “Print is dead” — just what every graduating senior wants to hear. Radio, too, is often touted as a dying medium. But is it, really?
My dad worked at KLOS, an L.A. classic rock radio station, for more than 20 years. He spent 23 years total working in the industry. Radio is, in effect, ingrained in my family. The sounds of Fleetwood Mac and Led Zeppelin were a constant presence in my house growing up, defining many of my childhood memories.
KXSC radio DJ Isabel Khalili-Lazarjani (pictured) claims radio substitutes such as Spotify and Pandora will never take the place of live, curated radio shows. — Molly Smith | Daily Trojan
Because of this, I have to know, for myself, and for my dad, what the real state of radio is today. So I spoke to a few people currently working in the business to get some answers, to hear about the state of radio from the industry perspective.
One such insider is Sky Daniels, who is currently interim general manager and program director at KCSN. He formerly programmed WLUP (Chicago), KFOG (San Francisco) and KISW (Seattle). He also worked at KMET (Los Angeles). Daniels left the radio business for about 15 years to pursue other music-related ventures, but ultimately came back.
“Radio was in my blood,” Daniels said.
The decline of radio can be attributed to two things. First, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allowed companies to own multiple stations, in effect enabling them to dominate certain genres. Second, the rise of the Internet in 1998, which offered unlimited access to music at a time when radio was becoming homogeneous and uninteresting.
To Daniels, radio skipped a generation as a result of these two factors.
“It’s that 1997-2010 era where radio kind of lost a generation of listeners,” Daniels said. “There’s where I think you see a lot of the ‘radio is dead.’”
Mark Felsot currently works as an engineer on NBC Sports Radio Network, KLOS Heidi and Frank Morning Show and KLOS Breakfast with the Beatles in addition to co-producing Tom Petty’s Buried Treasure show on SiriusXM. Among many other ventures, Felsot also worked on Little Steven’s Underground Garage SiriusXM show.
Similarly to Daniels, Felsot has also noticed a pattern: The industry has been shrinking. There used to be multiple stations for each genre (three country stations, four hip-hop stations, etc). The limitations can be felt on both sides of the airwaves.
“It meant less choice for the listener, but for the people who worked in radio, it meant less job opportunity,” Felsot said.
That being said, Felsot added, “I still think people use radio, but maybe not in the way that it was used 15 years ago.”
Interestingly, from the insider perspective, it would appear that radio is not dead, nor is it dying. It is simply smaller.
The Pew Research Center for Excellence in Journalism released a report, “The State of the News Media in 2013,” which supports the idea that radio is neither on its way out, nor is it thriving. The report said:
“In 2012, 92 percent of Americans age 12 or older listened to the radio at least weekly, essentially the same as it was a decade earlier (94 percent).”
People are still listening. The radio is still relevant.
A few weeks ago, I sat in on a friend’s radio show at USC’s KXSC. The DJ, Isabel Khalili-Lazarjani, chose film scores as the theme for her Thursday night show, Cat Nap. At 21-years-old, Khalili-Lazarjani is part of the generation that radio skipped. And yet, her love for the medium is infectious.
“Even if you have all these other ways to access some kind of pseudo-radio, it’s not real, it’s not curated,” Khalili-Lazarjani said. “That’s never going to replace a DJ sitting there with their own unique taste and experiences, putting together a playlist for listeners. That’s what I love about radio.”
Khalili-Lazarjani looks to Spotify, Pandora and YouTube as examples of “pseudo-radio.” These outlets bring music fans one step closer to finding music they might like, but it’s a flawed system, often skimming over local and international artists. They easily find what’s popular, but might miss what’s on the edges of the music scene, such as a cool, emerging band that’s just starting out.
These music-finding methods act as a stepping stone, but shouldn’t be treated as the final solution. Herein lies the importance of radio. As Khalili-Lazarjani said, radio is curated. DJs are storytellers, and they create experiences. They seek cool, new music out to be presented to the listener. Daniels could not agree more. He’s even seen younger listeners tuning into these trusted curators at KCSN as of late.
“Let’s face it, the one thing about the Internet is that it offers you infinite choice,” Daniels said. “You can seek out any and every type of music you want to pursue. But there is so much choice, and there is so much that is open to you that most people get to a point where they can’t continue to go on that kind of endless search. They want to find trusted curators, filters that say we’ll do some organizing and we’ll discover some artists that we think you might be interested in.”
Granted, it’s all in the programming. Much of radio today is still incredibly dull and repetitive, “vertical,” as Daniels puts it, because it’s all the same. This homogeneity has left Felsot feeling a bit doubtful about the future of radio.
“I’m not overly optimistic,” Felsot said. “Unfortunately, companies that are left that own a lot of radio stations, they’re not necessarily run by people who love radio.”
But then there’s much to be said for horizontal radio, what Daniels describes as robust, diverse and interesting programming that’s starting to seep its way back in. It acts as a throwback for the way radio used to be: broad and rich.
To answer my initial question, radio is not dead. It’s definitely past its golden age, but now we’re seeing radio rear its nostalgic head, looking to capture the dynamism of the past. From the soundbooth, radio is different, but it isn’t going anywhere.
“It ain’t dead yet,” Daniels said. “There’s still a heartbeat. We’re doing our best to keep it beating.”
Where it will take us exactly is unclear, but one thing is certain: “The next 10 years are going to be interesting,” Felsot said.
One final (unrelated) note, to those who read last week: My dad beat me in the father-daughter Oscar pool. I lost by one, but I still lost. Congratulations, dad. Until next year…

USC’s Asian Pacific American Student Assembly will host former Star Trek star and social media guru George Takei at Bovard Auditorium tonight at 6 p.m. The event is part of “Breaking Barriers,” a series of events in honor of Asian Pacific American Heritage month.

The actor and activist discussed his experience with Japanese American internment during World War II. Takei was five years old when he and his family were involuntarily transported to Santa Anita Race Track’s horse stables and later the Rowher War Relocation Center in Arkansas, as a result of former President Franklin Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066. Under the order, the U.S. military forced U.S. residents and citizens of Japanese ancestry (and many Asian-Americans who were not Japanese) to be relocated to internment camps where they experienced squalid living conditions and abuse.
Takei elaborated on his experiences, his acting career and his social media presence in a phone interview with the Daily Trojan.
DT: I know you grew up in Boyle Heights and you went to UC Berkeley and then UCLA, so why did you decide to visit USC?
GT: Ah, the Trojan connection. Well I do have a Trojan connection — my brother went to USC. UCLA came into my life as a result of a deal with my father. My father wanted me to be an architect, and, like a good son, I started up at UC Berkeley as an architecture student. But both he and I knew that my burning passion was the theater and acting.
DT: I feel like Asian American actors are kind of underrepresented in the mainstream. Do you agree with that sentiment, or do you feel that there’s someone who’s going to carry the torch for future generations?
GT: I have been an actor for more than half a century, now. Back in those days, there were practically no Asians on TV screens or on movie screens, and when you did see one, they were all very shallow stereotypes. Either the villain, or the buffoon, or the servant. So what you see today is a vast advancement from back then, so you have to take this all in context. Yes, it’s true, we don’t have as full a representation, but judging the whole history of the representation of Asians and Asian Americans, we’ve come a long ways.
DT: You mentioned how you were one of the only Asian American actors when you were starting out. I want to go back to your time growing up in the [World War II Japanese American] internment camps at Rowher and Santa Anita Park, could you talk about those experiences?
GT: When internment came down, I was very young. My birthday is April 20th and I had just turned five. A few weeks after that, my parents got my siblings and me up early one morning and dressed us very hurriedly. My brother and I were in the living room, looking out the front window, and we saw two soldiers come marching up with bayonets on their rifles. They stomped up to the front porch and banged on the door. My father answered it, and we were ordered out of our two-bedroom home.
My father gave us luggage for our brother and me and we were waiting outside in the driveway for our mother to come out. When she came out she had the baby in her left arm and in her right arm was a large duffle bag. Tears were streaming down her cheeks. A child never forgets that. That’s one experience, one scene I have seared into my memory.
From our two-bedroom home, we were taken to the horse stables at Santa Anita Race Track. So can you imagine how humiliating, how degrading it was for my parents, to go from a home and be told that all five of us were to sleep in this narrow horse stall which still reeked of horse manure. It was horrific. You know, we were innocent American citizens. We happened to look like the people who bombed Pearl Harbor, and that was the only reason why we were being forced into these circumstances. It was the most egregious violation of our U.S. Constitution.
DT: How do you go from something like that — being judged on the basis of your appearance — to performing, where your appearance is such an important part of your job?
GT: The acting passion is born in you. From the time I was a child, I was that show-off kid, who always performed. That’s not what parents would guide you to be doing. But as I described to you, the passion for acting made me want to at least try. And yes, it’s true, what I saw on TV and movies at that time were not very persuasive images. But I told my father that I will change it. You know, the arrogance of the idealistic teenager. But I had luck — that’s the amazing thing. Luck plays a big part of careers in this crazy business.
DT: You have a great social media presence. How do you generate social media content that’s so relatable? It seems like you get the best of the Internet.
GT: Well you gotta keep thinking, most people it’s about them. I had dinner at such-and-such restaurant last night. I’m wearing a such-and-such shirt. It’s not about me — it’s about them. It’s about your audience, your fans. I had an ulterior motive for going into social media. As you may or may not know, it’s been my mission in life to raise awareness of fellow Americans to that dark chapter of our history, where innocent citizens were incarcerated simply because of their ancestry, of their appearance … By trial and error I found that humor is what attracts people.
DT: It’s funny how it became so all-encompassing, in the way that there are people who share your links because they’re so funny. It’s very human, there are so many different facets to it. It’s not expressly one thing.
GT: Well it began with humor, but I sock it to them with various issues. Like the most recent one in Arizona where they tried to pass a bill saying “seriously religious people” in business can refuse service to gays and lesbians. And that’s outrageous. They mask discrimination under religion, you know?
DT: You’re pretty pluralistic about this religious problem. Do you feel that it’s not expressly a “Christian” problem, do you feel like it’s more of an ideological problem?
GT: Really, it’s bigotry, and using religion as a veil for it. In Christianity, for instance, Jesus served all people. He served the sick, he served those in jail. But these [lawmakers] are essentially trying to disguise their narrow-mindedness under the guise of religion. We can’t let people like that write their bigotry into civil law, or even their religious beliefs in civil law, which applies to everyone.
DT: It sounds like you’re a very strong proponent for the separation of religion and state.
GT: Absolutely. This nation was founded by people fleeing religious persecution, so these bigoted laws that they try to write into civil law, there’s no place for that. Not in this country. That’s why with humor, once you get a large enough audience, I entertain them with humor and occasionally serve them food for thought. We’ve got over six million people, that’s like what NBC, ABC and CBS was at one time when I was a kid.
DT: Then isn’t social media, in its own way, your own TV channel? You get to program what people get to see with a little bit of everything.
GT: Ain’t technology wonderful?

High school students can finally rejoice — the days of mandatory essays, obscure vocabulary and quarter-point guessing penalties are long gone. On Wednesday, College Board President David Coleman announced a series of changes to the SAT set to take effect in 2016, according to The New York Times. Though the long-criticized college entrance exam will certainly have a lot to improve as these changes take effect, such reforms promise to make a meaningful impact to students — particularly for those to whom costly test preparation isn’t an available luxury.
Design by Julien Nicolai
Marking the first update to the SAT since 2005, the College Board outlined a series of revisions to the popular college entrance examination. Going forward, the SAT will no longer require a mandatory essay section, thus reverting the test back to its original 1600 overall score — 800 for math and 800 for “evidence-based reading and writing.” Furthermore, the College Board pledged to reform its vocabulary expectations, ridding the test of obscure words such as “phlegmatic” and “crepuscular” in favor of more commonly used words students would expect to know in a university setting.
One of the most longstanding and valid criticisms of the SAT has been its failure to test students’ true academic ability, incentivizing test-takers to focus less on actually learning the material and more on learning how to “beat the test.” By attempting to reform the exam in a way that tests students on material that reflects their academic curriculum, the College Board is making vital revisions that have been long overdue.
The essay section of the SAT certainly won’t be missed. Almost all colleges require some sort of essay prompt in their applications, leaving little for college admissions counselors to learn from reading a student’s generic essay about Martin Luther King Jr. written within a 25-minute block of time. Furthermore, nothing is  gained from making students memorize superfluous vocabulary such as lachrymose or blunderbuss — words students would be hard-pressed to find in a college classroom, let alone in everyday language.
Perhaps one of the most impactful effects these revisions will have on students will be not only their test-taking abilities, but on the fairness of the examination as a whole — particularly for students who cannot afford expensive SAT preparation classes. SAT and ACT test prep classes can cost upwards of $2,000, according to U.S. News & World Report. If that weren’t enough, the average application fee can cost anywhere from $38 to $75 per school. USC’s application fee is a whopping $80.
As part of the College Board’s attempts to bridge the wealth divide and address the prevailing concern that students from wealthier households are given an unfair advantage with their access to pricey test prep courses, Coleman also announced the College Board’s new partnership with nonprofit educational website Khan Academy to provide free test prep materials for the newly redesigned SAT. Additionally, every income-eligible student will be provided with four fee waivers, allowing them to apply to colleges for free.
College application season is one fraught with stress and anxiety, and the SAT has long been part of that. Though the SAT is by no means perfect, these revisions go to show that the College Board is willing to address the SAT’s critics and rework the exam in a way that achieves its ultimate goal — to test students’ academic abilities in a way that is fair to all.

The SATs might now seem like eons ago for college students, but for those who are just now preparing for it, big changes are ahead. On Wednesday, College Board announced that the test would be redesigned to correspond more to the material learned in high school. Though the current test is not the best assessment of intelligence and college success by any means, some of the changes — particularly the decision to make the essay section optional — seem to be more of a step backward than one forward.
As someone who took the SAT almost three years ago, I do not agree that these tests have become “far too disconnected from the work of our high schools,” as College Board President David Coleman said at an event in Austin, Tex., according to CNN. Math will always be math. Reading will always encompass passage analyses and comprehension questions. There is only so much disconnecting possible.
For one, the optional essay is a big change that doesn’t seem to fix the disconnect — if anything, it seems to widen it. Writing as a form of communication will always be a part of one’s life, and the College Board’s decision to make the essay optional takes away a very integral element in the assessment-making process. The essay was first introduced as part of the SAT in 2005, and there were good reasons for it. Though it is true that the “reading and writing” sections will still be on the test, the act of sitting down and writing an essay in a pressured time period is something that a series of grammar questions can never truly replace. Moreover, if it does become an option and not a requirement, more students will be incentivized to skip one of the most crucial skills needed to be tested — not only as an indicator of college success, but also as a sign of future career success.
SAT test-taking strategies that have less to do with knowing the material and more with mastering the format of the test were also brought up as an issue that the new SAT design plans to address. Though there are certain test-taking strategies that the SAT does require, the tricks aren’t necessarily bad. Coleman reasoned that this new test would be “moving away from a need for test-taking tricks and strategies,” but requiring justifications for questions will not be much different because there’s strategy in explanations as well.
One of the arguments in support of changing the SAT includes reining in the culture of intense coaching and costly tutoring that the test has generated. Though this definitely points to good intentions, tests that college admissions officers rely so heavily will never diminish the tutoring business’s clientele. No matter the test format — whether it is simple multiple choice or a test geared more towards test-taking strategy — such tests will always generate anxiety and thus generate more profits for tutoring businesses. The AP tests are more about the justifications than just pure test-taking strategy, and there is an astronomical amount of profit being made off of students preparing for those. Would a new SAT with a few justification questions be any different?
Not all of these changes, however, are for the worse. The program to help low-income students with test prep and the inclusion of more online practice tests will certainly promise to revamp the test prep experience for the better. Yet the changes made to the content and substance of the test do not reflect well-designed or thought-out improvements. Thankfully, the new test will be released in the  spring 2016 — that’s plenty of time to refine and reconsider.
