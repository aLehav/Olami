Application numbers to Teach For America continue to rise, though the growth may be less the result of increased interest and more the result of decreased job opportunities.
Though specific application numbers for USC were unavailable, Tracy St. Dic, recruitment director for TFA in Southern California, said the organization, which recruits recent college graduates to teach in underprivileged areas for two years, has seen an increase in applications, likely because of a combination of rising interest levels and an uncertain job market.
“Nationwide, we’ve seen a phenomenal increase in applications,” St. Dic said. “I expect to see the same trend at USC this year.”
But it might not be just a soaring interest in the TFA program that is bringing in the extra applications.
Kyle McNeal, a senior majoring in international relations, said the poor economy is one of the main reasons he chose to apply for TFA.
“The horrible job market was pretty much a key reason that I applied to TFA,” McNeal wrote in an email. “I definitely wouldn’t want to be entering the job market by traditional means right now.”
McNeal hopes to land a stable job that can help him pay off housing costs and school loans.
“I have a lot riding on my application to Teach For America,” McNeal wrote. “Teach For America seems like a great way to avoid the difficulties and unpredictability of a messy job search.”
Still, St. Dic did not think the struggling economy was the primary reason for the increase in interest. Instead, she cited USC’s location and surrounding community.
According to St. Dic, because of USC’s geographical location, students are able to witness firsthand the achievement gap between poorer schools and their more affluent counterparts. Seeing this, St. Dic said, might inspire USC students to take action.
“Specifically at USC, I’ve seen an increased interest in Teach For America’s approach to end educational inequity, coupled with the fact that more students are rising to the challenge to make an immediate, positive impact right away after college,” St. Dic wrote in an email.
While St. Dic noted the economy could be having some effect on the number of applications, she held that increased interest in the program was a more important factor.
“It could be partly the economy,” St. Dic said. “And I think it could be Teach For America is improving its impact.”
Ari Feldman, a 2007 USC graduate, just finished a two-year TFA commitment in Phoenix. He said the economy did not affect his decision when he applied three years ago.
“I’d been thinking about doing TFA since my sophomore year of college,” Feldman said. “It hadn’t even crossed my mind.”
Feldman said the economic downturn has had a temporarily positive effect on TFA. He said that because more people are applying, it makes the program “more prestigious.”
However, Feldman feels that in the long run, the poor economy could actually have a negative effect on the program because TFA relies on charity and donations.
“There’s a lot funding that’s been cut,” Feldman said. “I was in Arizona and they completely cut the state funding. My first year we got $1.5 million, the next year a half million dollars, and this year they cut it down to nothing.”
Regardless of what has caused this increase, TFA is happy to have more students show an interest in its program.
“We need that strong, fighting Trojan force out there fighting to close the achievement gap,” St. Dic said.

Facing a rapidly changing media industry, Ernest J. Wilson III, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication and the newly elected chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, hopes to make public media once again a vehicle for civic discourse.
Elected chairman last week, Wilson is the longest serving member currently on the board of the CPB, a non-profit corporation established by the federal government aimed at promoting public media services for United States citizens.
Taking charge · Annenberg Dean Ernest J. Wilson III was elected chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting last week. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
“The CPB is supposed to foster civic engagement, education … news and entertainment and culture through noncommercial media,” Wilson said. “At the highest level, the goal is to help Americans lead more democratic, informed and satisfying lives.”
Wilson said there are three goals he intends to pursue during his one-year term as chairman — increasing dialogue, bringing public media into the digital age and improving the diversity of its content and audience.
“Public media is at a crossroads, beset with many technological, demographic and economic challenges,” Wilson said. “My goal is to pursue three themes — greater dialog with the relevant publics, more digital media and greater diversity in the content, audience and management of the system.”
Wilson’s colleagues at Annenberg lauded his in-depth knowledge of the media and said he was the perfect candidate to lead the CPB.
“He’s extremely bright and knowledgeable about media issues and has a deep commitment to public media, especially media functioning with the public interest in mind,” said Geneva Overholser, director of Annenberg’s School of Journalism.
Kay Heitzman, executive director of public affairs and special events at Annenberg, said Wilson is a great collaborator and a great thinker.
“He has a broad perspective on global communication and has many wonderful traits that I am sure helped him to become the chairman,” she said.
As chairman, Wilson will set the agenda for the CPB and occasionally act as a spokesperson. He said he is hoping to drive the CPB toward discovering ways of using noncommercial media to improve the lives of Americans in the present economic crisis.
Previously, Wilson served on the CPB board as the chair of the Digital Media Committee and of the Public Awareness Committee.
Already, the CPB has supported workshops, seminars and other activities instructing people on how to deal with the mortgage crisis. The CPB has also provided funding to local radio stations. Wilson, however, is hoping to find ways to use digital media to make an even greater difference in people’s lives.
Wilson said his new position will not take him away from his duties at Annenberg.
“It won’t affect the time commitment much, since I have been chairing the most active committee on the CPB Board — the new Digital [Media] Committee — and have already been devoting some time to it,” he said.
In fact, Wilson expects the chairmanship to enhance his contributions to Annenberg.
“By chairing a public media company, I am learning a lot about the real-world challenges and opportunities that face managers and employees, lessons I bring back to help shape our curriculum and how we train our students to succeed in this fast-changing world,” he said.
Overholser shared Wilson’s view on the value of working on various media boards.
“Many of us serve on several boards, and being on several boards brings richness to our work,” she said. “We will greatly benefit from the richness this appointment will add to his work.”
Wilson also hopes his appointment will be good for Annenberg.
“My new position has already modestly enhanced the visibility of the Annenberg School, as I can see from the number of congratulatory messages I have received from all across the country that say that both institutions should benefit from my new position,” he said.

Is there a saying that goes, “Don’t judge a restaurant by its name?” If not, there should be.
Located at Wilshire Boulevard and St. Andrew’s Place is the unfortunately named pizza parlor, Mr. Pizza. Yes, the name is cheesy and utterly forgettable, but, after hearing about its sweet potato-stuffed crust, I gladly braved an hour-long Metro bus ride to try it out.
Korea’s finest · An immensely popular restaurant in Korea, Mr. Pizza has only one location in the United States: Koreatown in Los Angeles. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
Despite its unoriginal name, the restaurant — a well-known chain in Korea — is surprisingly modern and chic. The ceilings are held high with impressive pillars, the walls are vibrantly colored and there is even an open kitchen where you can view your pizza dough being tossed in the air.
With wide windows beckoning in the sunlight and a bar complete with a plasma TV, Mr. Pizza is definitely not your average pizza joint.
Unfortunately, the service was rather inadequate. It took a good 15 minutes for the staff to notice my friend and me. Though the waiter served complimentary pickles and peppers immediately, it took more than 20 minutes for the food to arrive. When it finally did, all negative thoughts about bad service were forgotten.
Fusion cuisine can be a hit-or-miss. When it’s a miss, it’s terrible. But when it’s a hit, prepare for a fascinating gastronomical cultural tour, in which your tongue will be teased and tantalized by dimensions you never knew existed.
Mr. Pizza produces pizza creations that you won’t find in a traditional pizza parlor. Forget Dominoes, or even the famous Mozza. Forget that old-time debate between thin-crust and deep-dish pizza. Every component of the ingredients Mr. Pizza puts together complements each other perfectly in a beautiful stuffed-crust pie.
The restaurant has a special menu for Premium Pizzas, which showcases a recently added pizza called the Gesal Montand Gold Pizza. This hefty pie, which costs $26 for a regular 10-inch, boasts ingredients that include Alfredo cream sauce, ground beef, bell pepper, crab, paprika, bacon, cheddar cheese, oregano and blue cheese dressing with a sweet potato mousse-stuffed pizza crust.
Another popular pizza is the Potato Gold. At about $20 for a regular size, it is studded with tomato sauce, mushrooms, ground beef, corn, onions, baked potatoes, cheddar cheese, bacon, nacho chips and sour cream.
There are other ingredients besides crab if you desire a seafood pizza. The Shrimp Gold is another mix of different ethnic cuisines that somehow seem to be made for each other: Cajun shrimp, salsa sauce, mushroom, ground beef, corn, onion, bell pepper, olives and cheddar cheese.
The highlight of the pizza was undeniably the sweet potato-stuffed pizza crust. The crust, which is made of chewy dough and covered with toasted cheddar cheese, is stuffed with a sweet potato mousse. This light and delicious mousse is not the common orange sweet potato that tastes like mashed carrots; it is made with the Japanese satsumaimo, which is less sweet, but intense like roasted chestnuts. It tastes almost like a dessert bread, but makes a terrific combination with the savory pizza toppings.
There are other pizza options besides the Premium ones, such as the Bulgogi pizza, which is a simpler pizza topped with bulgogi beef, onions, bell peppers and mushrooms on a regular-crust pizza.
Though the concept of infusing the famous Korean beef on a pizza is innovative at best, the execution was a failure. The beef was overcooked and dry, and overall the pizza was disappointingly flavorless. There’s no question here — stick to the Premiums.
Mr. Pizza has only one restaurant in the entire United States and, luckily for Angelenos, it is located right in the heart of Koreatown. But don’t let the terribly hokey name fool you: Mr. Pizza will wow you with its impressive creations and leave you clamoring for more.
there is a mr. pizza located in stanton/garden grove (orange county).

Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley increased his workload at practice Tuesday and was adamant that he would play against Washington State.
Barkley missed Saturday’s 16-13 loss to Washington with a bone bruise in his right shoulder. His replacement, redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp, was just 13-of-22 for 110 yards with an interception.
No questions asked · Matt Barkley, who is certain that he will be available to play this week, tossed a ball with Pete Carroll during practice. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
“I’m playing no matter what,” Barkley said after practice Tuesday. “I don’t care if it hurts or not. I’ll be in there.”
Barkley split 7-on-7 snaps with Corp and completed all five of the passes he attempted before sitting out of the 11-on-11 scrimmage.
“He made it through it,” USC coach Pete Carroll said of the 19-year-old Barkley. “The most difficult challenge right now is to manage this really well, so we’ll try to do it right and see if we can get him prepared.
“In the meantime, Aaron’s doing his stuff and getting ready.”
Asked what he thought of Corp’s performance, Barkley chose his words carefully.
“I’m not really gonna say,” he said. I thought he did the best with the opportunities that we had. We just had a couple tough breaks across the board.”
Corp said he still expects to be the starter heading into Saturday.
“I’ve got the respect of my teammates,” he said. “I’ll be ready to go regardless of if Matt’s healthy or he’s not.”

Trojan running backs coughed up the ball four times against Washington — two times by junior tailback Joe McKnight, one by senior tailback Stafon Johnson and one off a catch by redshirt junior fullback Stanley Havili.
“We’ve gotta take care of the ball, can’t turn it over,” running backs  coach Todd McNair said. “We have addressed it, and we’ll go about raising our consciousness about it. We should be alright.”
McKnight’s fumbles were both recovered by the Trojans, but Johnson and Havili’s resulted in turnovers deep in Husky territory.
“It was tough,” McKnight said. “I tried to install it in my head to take care of the ball, but I let it get away from me twice in that game, so I gotta work on it from there … That’s how we lost the game.”
USC still rushed for a collective 250 yards on 33 carries and outgained the Huskies on the ground by a sizable 184 yards.
“You take the good things and you build on the good things,” McNair said. “You take the bad and you correct it.”
u
Third-string quarterback Mitch Mustain continued to take after-practice repetitions at punter.
“It went pretty well,” Mustain said. “I can’t wait to get some team reps tomorrow. It felt good.”
The unprecedented try-out comes on the heels of shaky performances by junior punter Billy O’Malley thus far. O’Malley has averaged 37.3 yards in 15 attempts.
“[Mustain] has a great get-off time,” Carroll said. “He’s our fastest guy by far.”
•
Senior safety Taylor Mays did bits of running on the sidelines at practice, but sat out of team drills.
“I don’t think that’s a great sign,” Carroll said. “I was hoping he would be ready today. But that doesn’t mean he won’t make it.”

“I don’t think that’s a great sign,” Carroll said. “I was hoping he would be ready today. But that doesn’t mean he won’t make it.”
It is very important to their season that Taylor gets back on the field. It could be argued he is the quarterback of the defense.

Is it really that absurd to argue that USC still has a shot at the national title?
No.
Let me explain.
Of the top 10 teams in the preseason Associated Press poll, only five have escaped the first three weeks unscathed. First Virginia Tech and Oklahoma fell, then Oklahoma State and Ohio State, and now USC.
One-game mishap · USC may have fumbled away a win in Seattle, but the Trojans are not out of title contention just yet, Pedro Moura writes. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
So Florida and Texas are No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in the latest AP poll — and, well, they have been all season. But what have they done to deserve that ranking?
The Gators have three wins, but their first two games were incredible cupcakes. In my book, playing Charleston Southern and Troy don’t even count. In its first semblance of a test — at home against a Tennessee team that won five games last season — Florida eked out a 23-13 win. (By the way, did you see that Eric Berry-Tim Tebow collision? Ridiculous.)
Florida — as good as its defense is and all — has obvious holes. The Gators’ passing game is weak. Louis Murphy and Percy Harvin are gone and Tebow’s 2009 targets include the illustrious Riley Cooper and Cade Holliday. Pretty much the only legitimate pass catcher that Florida has is junior tight end Aaron Hernandez.
Tennessee’s defense essentially shut down the Gators through the air on Saturday.
Texas? Its first two games weren’t any tougher, and the Longhorns struggled to beat Texas Tech last weekend.
Their running game isn’t overly impressive and senior quarterback Colt McCoy has four interceptions already. The Longhorns’ interior defensive line is adequate at best.
A rebuilding Texas Tech team, featuring a quarterback making his first career road start, put up a fight — in Austin, no less.
If there were ever a year in which USC could recover from an early-season loss, this would be the one.
Let’s take a look at the other preseason top-10 teams that haven’t lost yet. They all have their weaknesses.
No. 3 Alabama snuck by then-No. 7 Virginia Tech in Week 1 in a mistake-ridden performance on both sides. The Crimson Tide have a first-year starter at quarterback and two top-10 matchups on their schedule — at No. 4 Ole Miss on Oct. 10 and at home against No. 7 LSU on Nov. 7.
Speaking of which — Ole Miss at No. 4? Come on, that win over Florida last season is the only reason the Rebels are ranked this high. Houston Nutt is still the coach in Oxford, and you can bet anything they will lose at least one SEC game.
No. 5 Penn State isn’t any better than they were last season, and we all know what happened in 2008. There was a tussle of sorts between the Trojans and the Nittany Lions in January, and USC came out on top. Since then — well, let me quote the Penn State student radio station: “If lined up against the 2008 Penn State Nittany Lions, this year’s squad would appear far inferior.”
And what does this go to show?
If USC wins out, I’d put its odds at 50-50 to be in the Rose Bowl.
And not the Pac-10 versus Big Ten Rose Bowl, but the real this-year-it’s-the-national-championship-game Rose Bowl.
It comes down to this: One SEC team will be in the national championship game, whether that be Florida, Alabama or another hard-nosed squad that gets on some type of roll late in the season. The Big-12 champion — read  Texas — is expected to fill the other spot. Of course, if the Longhorns win out, they’re in.
But if they don’t — and they’ve got a tough three-week stretch in October of away games at Missouri and No. 16 Oklahoma State along with a home date against Oklahoma — that opens the door for either Cal, USC or a one of few other schools.
I know what you’re thinking.
The way USC played on Saturday, I doubt they’ll come close to winning out.
True. But the same can be said of any national title contender after one of the weeks this year.
Florida would have been killed by a legitimate SEC team on Saturday.
Last year’s Texas Tech team could have beat this year’s Texas team. Alabama would have lost to Virginia Tech team if they were in better  shape. Penn State hasn’t played anyone of remote value. LSU nearly lost to a team on a 14-game losing streak.
This is the year of the faulty contender. USC needs to take advantage of that. It starts with a trip up to Cal next week. If the Trojans win that, they’ll put themselves into position to be the second-choice team to fill up the national championship game.
Not that bad, eh? Hold your head up, USC.
“Looking Past the X’s & O’s” runs Wednesdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Pedro at pmoura@usc.edu.
USC is #10 in the poll that matters, and that’s the Coaches poll. The AP poll isn’t part of the BCS formula and hasn’t been for a few years. I have no idea why everyone obsesses on the AP poll, it really is pretty much irrelevant. USC just needs to climb into BCS territory. The bigger problem, apart from recent years, is that they don’t have a QB who really can lead them to the promised land. I truly want them to succeed wildly, but reality say that they’ll lose at least one and maybe two of the games at Cal. Oregon, or ND…..recent offensive performances would suggest that is realistic. The polls tend to punish them way more though than an SEC team. It’s not fair, but it’s East coast and SEC bias at its worst. UCLA beat TN two times running and the national media seems to pay attention when Florida beats them, but UCLA and the Pac 10 get no credit. It is what it is. Bias at its worst. LSU can lose twice, give up 40+ points and still go to the championship game. The BCS stinks, pure and simple.
This was obviously written before the Washington game and revised to add in the loss.  We have to scrap all this analysis and delay until we have seen a couple of more games — it was just that bad.
Sorry, but by “Rose Bowl,” I meant for the national championship game.
This article is just wishful thinking, and more than likely just filler material.  Giving the Trojans a “50-50 shot” to be in the Rose Bowl is utterly ridiculous. I am a USC student and a Trojan faithful, but you have to look at things a tad more objectively.
What you fail to address is the real problem: USC’s loss dropped them all the way to #12. On the surface, that means that not only does USC have to win out, but ten other teams ranked ahead of them will have to lose in order for them to be ranked in the top two. That would be difficult enough, but it isn’t that easy. If teams such as Florida, Texas or Alabama lose a game, they more than likely will still be ranked ahead of USC because they play in tougher conferences with tougher competition. Example: If the Florida-LSU game on 10 October is close, there is no way the loser would drop behind a Trojan team that lost to pathetic Washington. The same goes with any game that pits two highly ranked SEC or Big 12 teams against one another.
And that doesn’t even take into account the craziness that is the BCS ranking.
So, yes, USC is not completely out of the national championship race, but it is a long shot. A very, very long shot; it would take a season that featured a couple upsets a week. Perhaps next time an article like this can be more realistic and objective.
“So Florida and Texas are No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in the latest AP poll — and, well, they have been all season. But what have they done to deserve that ranking?”
Well for one, they haven’t lost to a team that they were favored to beat by 21 points.  They also haven’t lost to a team that had lost 15 in a row.  Whenever you decide to take off your “cardinal and gold” shades and are off the Trojan kool aid please let us know.

For the No. 2 USC women’s golf team, this season is all about redemption.
After falling just short of their goal of a national championship last season, the Women of Troy seek to reclaim the title that eluded them last year.

“We look forward to getting back that national championship in the spring,” said junior Lizette Salas, a first team All-American last season.
After winning the 2008 NCAA title, the team led the 2009 National Championship going into the final round only to finish third, nine strokes back of Arizona State. For then-freshman Jennifer Song, the heartbreak was doubled by her second-place finish after leading on the final day. Song led by two strokes heading into the final round, only to see it slip away on the final hole to finish one stroke behind Purdue’s Maria Hernandez.
This year, the team is determined to get back to the top. The Women of Troy return their top six golfers from last season, including everyone that traveled to the National Championship. Led by an All-American trio — Song, Salas and senior Belen Mozo — the team’s expectations are nothing short of another NCAA title.
Song, now a sophomore, returns to attempt to top a phenomenal season that culminated in her breaking the school single-season scoring record. She finished the season as the top female collegiate golfer in the country, with nine top-10 finishes during the season and a scoring average of .18 strokes below par. After the season, she was named a First Team All-American and the NCGA Freshman of the Year.
Instead of using the summer to rest, Song continued her torrid pace and became just the second woman to win two USGA titles in one year. After winning the US Women’s Amateur Public Links Championship by the largest margin in tournament history, she went on to win the US Women’s Amateur Championship. In between, she finished 13th at the US Women’s Open Championship — the top finish by an amateur.
Now that she’s back in school, Song isn’t planning on slowing down.
“It definitely gave me a lot of confidence, and going into the season I’m full of energy and really excited,” Song said.
Still, she doesn’t dwell on last season’s success, saying, “I just try to hit one shot at a time.”
Salas, now a two-time All-American, finished last season ranked fourth in the nation. Her nine top-10 finishes, which included two victories, earned her the Pac-10 Women’s Golfer of the Year award. Salas also broke the school’s scoring record last season, with an average of only .09 strokes over par. Salas, however, isn’t satisfied with last season’s finish.
“I kind of struggled towards the end of last year,” she said, referring to her 18th-place finishes at the NCAA West Regional Tournament and the National Championship.
Over the summer, Salas also struggled with a back injury at the end of last season. Though her competitive schedule was limited, she competed in the US Women’s Amateur and the US Women’s Public Links this summer. After making it to the round of 16 in the Public Links, she fell in the second round of the US Amateur to the eventual champion: Song.
“I learned a lot this summer and I’m just now getting healthy and back into competitive golf,” Salas said. “I’m just going to keep getting stronger and come back better this year.”
Mozo seeks to become the first ever four-time All-American for the Trojans this season after being named a Second Team All-American last year. While struggling with a shoulder injury last season, Mozo’s game was inconsistent. She earned three top-10 finishes and set a personal record with a 65 at the 2009 UCF Challenge, besting her previous low score by three strokes. Her 65 tied with Song for the lowest round on the team last season and marked the third-lowest score of any golfer in the country.
Mozo underwent shoulder surgery over the summer and is just beginning to recover.
“She’s starting to swing now, but we don’t have her swinging drivers yet,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said. “We’ll see if she can come back for any of our October tournaments, but we don’t want to rush anything.”
Also returning is 2008 All-American Stefanie Endstrasser. The senior struggled with her game last season, but showed flashes of brilliance in her third place finish at the 2008 Mason Rudolph Championship.
“Stephanie hasn’t been up to form, but she’s been working really hard,” Gaston said. “She played a few events over the summer while attending summer school in Europe.”
The team is also looking for continuing contributions from senior Caroline Kim and sophomore Inah Park. Both became regular contributors for the Women of Troy last season, but they’ll be challenged for their roster spots by Endstrasser and incoming freshman Cyna Rodriguez.
Rodriguez, a native of the Philippines, recently attended the prestigious David Leadbetter Golf Academy in Florida to prepare for collegiate competition. Her victories on the amateur circuit make her an instant contender for a roster spot.
The road to redemption for the Women of Troy begins this Friday at the Mason Rudolph Championship at the Legends Golf Club in Nashville, Tenn. Gaston sees the fall season as a time for “everyone to get the competitive experience so we can have more depth and count on every player.”

While some students are staying close to home to save money, Trojans continue to traverse the globe, defying a national trend.
A recent survey conducted by the Forum on Education Abroad found that overseas study enrollment is down for the first time in decades. USC, however, does not seem to have followed suit.
Overseas · Kamisha Brooks (right)and Jordann Zbylski (left), both sophomores majoring in theatre, speak with representatives from USC’s Office of Overseas Studies about the opportunities available for study abroad and the expenses associated with the programs. - Amaresh Sundaram Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan
Although exact numbers for USC’s study abroad program are not yet available, Overseas Studies Program Assistant Veronica Gomez, said, USC’s attendance numbers “don’t appear to match [the study] now.”
The study, conducted between August and September of this year, surveyed the study abroad percentages for 165 colleges, including public, private, international and US-based provider organizations. Sixty-six percent of all schools, and 58 percent of private universities, reported plunges in study abroad enrollment.
“This could be fairly typical — in a given year you might have certain institutions that have decreased enrollment — but it does seem the majority are reporting a downturn in enrollment,” said Brian Whalen, president of the Forum.
Gomez said she thinks USC may be going against the grain because of its study abroad financial aid policy — unlike at many other schools, students are able to use their financial aid abroad.
Study abroad costs differ from country to country, according to Gomez. Australia, New Zealand and Ireland are among the cheapest, while the UK is one of the most expensive.
Caitlin Chang, a junior majoring in history, said she had applied for spring study abroad in Greece, which would be cheaper than a semester at USC even with living expenses. Chang speculated that other students might be forgoing study abroad opportunities because of political and economic reasons.
“People have this perception that it’s a tough traveling climate — though now America’s more popular with other countries because of our president,” said Chang “[But] I think it’s mostly money … I guess it’s hard for people to imagine spending money in a foreign country when we need to stimulate our own economy.”
But some students are not letting costs stand in their way.
Michael Blong, a junior majoring in philosophy, said he will be spending the spring semester in Madrid, having decided that the experience was worth the expense.
“Studying abroad is an experience I’ve wanted to have since I was a kid, really,” said Blong. “For me the expenses were going to happen regardless.”

Nearly two years ago, a screenplay appeared on the Internet that had every screenwriting nerd blogging with fervor.
The script followed two teenage girls as their friendship unraveled when one is turned into a maneating demon by a devil-worshipping indie rock band. If that wasn’t enough ammunition for gossip and backlash, the script also featured nonsensical dialogue like “Hey, Vagisil,” and “You’re lime green Jell-O and you don’t even know it.”

It was not so much these outrageous plot points and one-liners that made the screenplay a buzz topic on numerous movie message boards, but the name of writer who apparently penned it all: Diablo Cody.
Cody was just then surfacing in Hollywood with her debut screenplay Juno, the quirky little indie film that was an instant hit at film festivals and an even bigger hit at the box office. As we all know, Cody would later win an Academy Award for Juno and become one of the most recognizable screenwriters in contemporary cinema.
But while Juno was busy making its theatrical rounds and winning over thousands of hearts, obsessive web users were posing one simple question in regards to this poorly written, pop culture reference-laden horror-comedy titled Jennifer’s Body written by the so-called brilliant Cody: “WTF?”
Two years later, it appears that Jennifer’s Body was no joke.
Directed by Karyn Kusama (Girlfight, Aeon Flux), Jennifer’s Body is a well-made, highly stylized B-movie that is garnering more attention and rave reviews than it should.
Megan Fox, the current “It Girl” among adolescent males, stars as Jennifer, who, not so coincidentally, is the It Girl in Devil’s Kettle, a small, dead-end town located in the wooded depths of Minnesota. Though Jennifer is easily the most popular and lusted-after girl at school, she remains best friends with Needy (Amanda Seyfried), a nerdy Plain Jane who seems content with her incredibly dorky yet adorable boyfriend, Chip (Johnny Simmons).
But staying true to her namesake, Needy does whatever Jennifer wants.  And so, when Jennifer asks Needy to accompany her to the town’s seedy dive bar to see an indie rock band, led by an eyeliner-clad Nikolai (Adam Brody), Needy faithfully answers Jennifer’s beck and call.
At first a carefree adventure, the night takes a sudden tragic turn when the bar catches on fire during the band’s set. Jennifer and Needy safely escape the blaze, as do Nikolai and his band members. Once outside, Nikolai drags Jennifer into the band’s shady van and drives away into the night; that’s the last time Needy sees her childhood best friend free of demons.
But, of course, that’s when the blood, gore, cheesy special effects and painful overacting begin.
Kusama’s return to the director’s chair is bittersweet. While she could benefit from a lesson or two from Alfred Hitchcock on building suspense, Kusama displays a strong vision with her vibrant visual design and crisp cinematography. But the script’s constant flip-flopping from horror to comedy leaves Kusama tonally confused. As a result, the comedy arises from the film’s awkward dialogue and character interactions, and the actual horror is sparse throughout.
While Fox’s acting is a hopeless case, Kusama is actually able to pull several powerful moments from Seyfried before the scenes turn melodramatic. With these glimpses of Kusama’s directing ability scattered throughout the film, it is truly a shame that she chose to waste her talent  on a mediocre script.
That’s not to say that Cody does not possess any talent of her own. Cody has a knack for creating unusual-yet-intoxicating worlds where girls describe guys as “salty” and adults are hardly authority figures.
Athough Jennifer’s Body might read as the direct opposite of feminist ideals as it reverts to over-the-top man-hating, there is something refreshing about watching a female take charge on screen, even if it is by feeding off the corpses of her male classmates. By turning the conventions of the horror genre inside out with a hot female playing the diabolical antagonist, Cody delivers a cheesy-yet-relatively fresh perspective of the genre. But combined with the underdeveloped lesbian undertones, expositional voice-overs and plot holes looser than the limbs on Jennifer’s victims, it is clear Jennifer’s Body was written by an amateur.
It’s no secret that the film industry is built on brand recognition, which makes it even more troublesome to both tasteful cinephiles and aspiring filmmakers that Cody can pass off her overly quirky, unforgivably shallow characters and mindless dialogue as a unique style simply because of Juno’s unforeseen triumph at the box office and Academy Awards. Many have claimed that an Oscar win for your first screenplay is a curse in disguise, for audiences and critics alike will forever set the bar for the rest of your work at the quality of your first script.
When it comes to Cody and her writing, it seems that audiences need to lower their expectations from now on.

Mickey surely lost one of his friends last Friday in the rotund Dick Cook. Much to Hollywood’s complete surprise, Cook, a proud USC alumnus, resigned as chairman of Walt Disney Studios. With that, the Cook empire — at one point a panoply of wondrous moviemaking but more recently a succession of big-budget star vehicles that either sank or soared — falls.
Or does it? Will Cook’s legacy live on?
The lead-up to Cook’s resignation actually held few surprises.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
The signs were many, even if they were seemingly minor. Ultimately, Cook and Disney CEO Bob Iger were philosophically at odds, and Disney finally suffered for it. Cook was no more responsible than Iger; both contributed mightily in selling Disney out.
Tragically, Disney Studios has been in a bad way for some time now — creatively, philosophically and, recently, financially. In that sense, Cook’s abrupt departure might shock it back into prosperity, or at least make it re-evaluate its priorities.
This past summer saw such embarrassments as Race to Witch Mountain and G-Force besmirch Disney’s once-unimpeachable name. The so-called magic of Disney — which, when captured in film, little else can rival — seemed then impossibly far off, or perhaps lost amid sloppy storytelling and mounds of computer-generated imagery.
Disney was once the undisputed master of modern fairytales, reimagining and reinventing them with preternatural ease. Few, if any, would say that today.
Cook knew of this old magic; he actually managed to conjure it up with a Mickey-like wave of his wand on several occasions, including such masterpieces as Lilo & Stitch, the Pixar movies and even Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.
But for each masterpiece, there were a great many of magic-less failures: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, National Treasure (and its ill-advised sequel) and, of course, the notoriously convoluted Pirates sequels. The problem, of course, was the public’s ravenous consumption of those cinematic monstrosities, great big movies of little-to-no substance.
Cook was enamored with the blockbuster, and may have forgotten Disney’s purpose. No doubt he was a first-class businessman and by many accounts simply the nicest guy around, but his focus was more commercial than it ought to have been. Consider one of the studio’s final achievements under Cook’s leadership: green-lighting a remake of Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, with McG — whose obsession with things that go boom ruins movies — on board to direct.
Of course, few can expect Iger — the great commercializer of Disney — to make meaningful strides in rescuing the studio, especially in light of a recent Los Angeles Times article that names Disney Channel President Richard Ross as a possible replacement for Cook (repeat: Disney Channel president). An infinitely better choice would be John Lasseter, the chief creative officer for Pixar and Disney Animation Studios, whose name has also been mentioned. Pixar has garnered much of Disney’s success in the past decade.
It is easy to dismiss the question of Cook’s successor as unimportant — merely another corporate wrinkle to be ironed out and forgotten — but easy does not mean correct. Though most of us will not think of it this way, this choice will play a role in shaping the consciousness of the next generation. Rare is the child who didn’t grow up in the company of Simba, Aladdin, Belle and Ariel. Who will replace these figures, these teachers, these magical mythmakers and indispensable contributors to the flowering of our collective imagination? Someone with a title as corporate-sounding as “studio head” will essentially decide.
Significant changes in leadership are often special moments for deep reflection and re-evaluation. They don’t come around all that often, and should be treated with exquisite care. Generally, much is at stake.
Obviously, Iger’s selection will not radically alter the cosmic course of human events, not like a presidential election. But the notion of corporate mythmakers — Disney or otherwise — should give us pause. These men and women make choices that extend well beyond the walls of their high-rise corporate headquarters. The next generation of Disney movies will do much to cultivate the next generation of imaginations.
Who will have that very great power, that very great responsibility?
Very likely, the man behind Hannah Montana.
Dick Cook, for all your faults, you will be missed.

If I gave you a puzzle, and offered you a little money if you completed it faster than another person who was not offered any money, would you solve the puzzle faster? Social scientists have been researching problems like this for decades and the answer: probably not. That’s strange — what if I offered to give you a large sum of money for completing a task before another unpaid competitor? The research suggests that you’d do even worse.
These are the findings of a study conducted by Professor Dan Ariely and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Of the nine tasks the researchers tested in three experiments, eight revealed that “higher incentives led to worse performance.” Additionally, a meta-analysis of 51 studies of worker-performance done at the London School of Economics concluded that profit incentivizing “can result in a negative impact on overall performance.” These experiments and conclusions have been replicated time and time again.
This seems counterintuitive. Surely, if someone offered me a truckload of money to move a bunch of heavy boxes while competing against another person told to do it for “fun,” I’d win. Ariely’s experiments confirm this intuition, but what the research indicates is that when a task moves beyond simple physical work to include “even rudimentary cognitive skill,” higher incentives lead to worse performance.
Dan Pink, author and former speech writer for Al Gore, has written extensively about changing the way work is managed and done. In a recent TED video, he lays out an argument against traditional models of business based on management and financial incentives and claims that there is a “mismatch between what science knows and what business does.” According to Pink, the first thing businesses have to do is pay everybody equally, so internal competition for incentives disappears. Pink then points to businesses like Atlassian, a software programming company, and Google,  who are now using management models that draw on these scientific findings. Both companies have a 20 percent rule, whereby they tell their engineers to go work on whatever they want for 20 percent of their paid work time. The engineers are not incentivized or pressured by management from above, but given free reign to work on what they want to. In both cases, the adoption of this policy has been unequivocally successful.
In the 1980s, Japanese companies also moved away from traditional business models and consequently became the second largest economy in the world. Harvard Professor Ezra Vogel identified the characteristics of Japanese companies that set them apart from traditional Western systems: bottom-up decision-making, less specialization, improved job security and group orientation as opposed to orienting the company around individuals. Each of these characteristics involve moving away from incentives for individual success and towards a more rounded and free participation in the company and its work.  The success of these Japanese business models can be seen in the phenomenal widespread consumption of Japanese electronics and cars.
In Ariely’s experiments, and in many others, people are given a task and are either incentivized through material rewards or are just told to do it. The difference between the two groups is that one is motivated externally by money and the other is motivated internally by the challenge of the task at hand. This difference in motivation is the factor that alters the performance and self-satisfaction in completing the task.
The cognitive dissonance theory is a well-studied psychological framework which states that when a person experiences a contradiction in their head, an unpleasant emotional state arises. According to the theory, people act to reduce this unpleasant feeling of cognitive dissonance by altering their beliefs to make themselves appear more rational than they are.
In one classic study, two groups of children were told to do a certain task, one group was rewarded and the other was not. When questioned later about task was, the rewarded group thought the task had less value and expressed less interest in doing the task again than the group that wasn’t rewarded. The suggestion is that the group that was rewarded experienced cognitive dissonance between the beliefs of wanting to do the task for money and wanting to do it for it for fun, so they altered their beliefs unconsciously to think that they were just doing it for the money.
This doesn’t mean companies shouldn’t pay workers, but that companies should not focus the work around profit through incentives and instead around the work itself for it’s inherent value. Doing so would make people work more happily and more productively.
Some hardcore liberals might exclaim, “Equal pay! Less management! Sounds like a pile of socialist hogwash to me.” Well, if by socialism, they mean equality in the workplace and improved performance, then they’re right. The kinds of business models that this science points towards are the opposite of traditional capitalist notions where money is the fundamental mover and shaker that creates socioeconomic harmony. Keep in mind that the empirical evidence also rebukes the Soviet Communist model of extreme regulation and micromanaging of industry.
So what would this new model of business be called? I think it is equally compatible with non-state forms of socialism and pre-corporate free markets, like the American economy in most of the 18th and 19th centuries. Of course, the label applied to it is much less important than the urgent need for business reform in the United States.
Take the private bank system in the United States for instance. The yearly and quarterly bonuses are what bankers work to maximize and it doesn’t take an elephant to remember where those guys led us: total economic meltdown and the borrowing of almost $1 trillion, which the New York Times recently questioned would ever be paid back. The business models of banks is at the other end of the spectrum from what science favors.
Look at the disparity between income of those at the top and bottom of companies. Researchers at Cornell University have found that the ratio of executive salaries to worker salaries was 30-to-1 in the 1970s and was about 648-to-1 in 2000. How can people not be motivated externally by financial incentives when those around them are paid either vastly more or less than themselves?
The recent public demand to cap bonuses is a step in the right direction, but is just the beginning of the massive overhaul that is needed. Imagine going to work and being able to work on whatever you want without the threat of losing pay or your entire job. Of course this requires intelligence, creativity and motivation to work hard, but isn’t that exactly what higher education is capable of nurturing in its students?
A favorite example of mine is film director Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove), who was an utter failure in the reward-based system of public education; during some school years, his attendance rate was below 50 percent. Nonetheless, Kubrick went on to become one of the most respected artists and intellectuals of the 20th century. His quote on learning is equally applicable to the workplace: “Interest can produce learning on a scale compared to fear as a nuclear explosion to a firecracker.”

Can greed, for lack of a better word, ever be good? Director Oliver Stone seems to think so as he has just begun production on his latest film, Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps. With this sequel to his Academy Award-winning film Wall Street, Stone attempts to prove just that.
Like the original film in the 1980s, Wall Street 2 highlights the turbulence of the stock market and how money can be lost just as easily as it can be made. Yet this time around, Stone chooses to comment on the fallout from the 2008 economic crisis instead of the insider trading scandals prevalent during the mid 1980s.
Greed, of course, will be the center of Stone’s latest film; but as it looks now, Stone is making extremely drastic changes to express this sentiment.
“Greed, for lack of a better word, is good,” is at once the most famous and appropriate quote from Wall Street because it fully embodies the film’s true gem: the ruthless businessman Gordon Gekko, whom Michael Douglas earned an Oscar for portraying.
Gekko is the absolute example of 1980s materialism and excess. He mutilates the idea of the American Dream, and how capitalism can propel it by giving up all morality and concentrating solely on the notion of monetary gain. Gekko uses insider trading to make his millions and, as a result, he sleeps very comfortably at night.
Stone uses this personification of true capitalism to drive his 1987 classic, and Douglas conveys astonishingly well the determination of someone who is completely consumed by greed. Together, Stone and Douglas created an infamous persona whose lack of morality makes quite an impact.
All of that will most likely change with the film’s upcoming sequel.
Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps presents an entirely different version of Gekko. As he subsequently goes to prison at the end of the first film for insider trading, the sequel picks up 20 years later with his release and reformation.
He leaves prison as a new man, and, according to Stone, Gekko “has to redefine himself, redefine his character. He’s looking for that second chance.”
Stone further elaborated that Gekko will now have a different force driving him: compassion. It is something that he would never have understood in the original Wall Street. The sequel has Gekko attempting to help the stock market before it inevitably crashes, as well as trying to reconnect with his daughter — actions that are seemingly out of place for Gekko’s character.
This is quite a paradox, one that has the possibility of not only tarnishing Stone’s newest film, but his Oscar-winning original as well. How can such a charismatic villain suddenly become the hero?
Stone is still portraying Gekko as somewhat of a radical, and has initiated the fact that Gekko is now being recognized as more of an anti-hero. It is very possible that Stone will maintain Gekko’s cutthroat determination, but his capitalist ethics are only applicably projected if Gekko is a villain.
As a villain, Gekko is infamous; as a hero, he will merely be a contradiction. His flare comes from his wickedness and his ferocity has made him famous, even if he is a corporate monster.
Stone himself is astonished at how much of a celebrity his fictional character has become in the business world.
“I can’t tell you how many young people have come up to me in these years and said, ‘I went to Wall Street because of that movie,’” Stone told the New York Times right before production began.
He’s right. Gekko made behaving badly irresistible, much like the overall excess he represents in Wall Street. He is characterized by his malevolent deeds; to take that all away from him now could quite easily cripple Gekko’s persona.
If he is practicing selflessness instead of Reaganomics, then he will just not be the same man. He is characterized a corporate shark that should not care about anything but money and regards endearing benevolence as a waste of time.
Time will tell if Stone can bring back the same passion of a greedy, self-absorbed WASP now that the character has reformed himself, while still holding on to the drive that made Gekko and Douglas so powerful in 1987. It is certainly possible, but the weariness surrounding Gekko’s transformation leaves too much room for skepticism.
But you can always trust a character like Gekko to not die without a fight — it is his business sense, really, that drives him — and he even validates his determination in Wall Street when he says, “Money never sleeps.” There is always a reassuring feeling when he says this because, like money, Gordon Gekko never sleeps.

When I was a kid, every story I read was as big as the world. People often reminisce over their backyards that spanned continents and decades — and yes, I was definitely that kid on the block who loved to play pretend. But more than anything, I remember the stories I loved — their pages dense with faraway places and lost worlds and filled to the brim with words that stuck to me like drying ink.
Recently, I read an article titled “Literature is dead.” It was written like an obituary, a farewell to an old friend. So many things that once held thriving vitality seem to be dead these days, such as literature and journalism. Some people blame the changes on the prioritization of entertainment; others declare that the Internet is at fault and even more believe that the written word no longer holds any potency.
Sadly, this article was simply the affirmation of a demise of which I was already aware.
A few months ago, my little sister, who is now a spunky seventh-grader, asked me for advice in compiling her summer reading list. She said she wanted a gold star from our local library; she had to log 100 hours of reading and did not want to “waste her time with silly stories about friendly giants or hobbits with hairy feet.”
To gauge her literary interests, I asked her what her favorite stories were when she was younger.
Her response?
She stared back at me with mocking eyes and a smirk foreshadowing those angst-ridden teenage years my mother never wants to relive.
“Tiffany,” she said, “I don’t know. Aren’t they all pretty much the same?”
To this day, I can tell you which stories I loved and worshipped as a kid. These books were the reasons why I was able to see the world from a living room armchair. The Lorax converted me into an environmentalist long before Al Gore got his hands on a PowerPoint, Poppy gave me a ridiculous phobia of owls and who in the world never dabbled in the long-winded literature love affair that is Harry Potter?
I read Ella Enchanted at least a dozen times in elementary school, each reading a little more heartbreaking and wonderful than the last. I went to where the sidewalk ends, stored dreams in jars with a friendly giant and walked two moons. I wanted to live among the wolves, have adventures in a little house on the prairie and turn into animals with just one touch. My library card used to be sacred; I would swipe it carefully with every passing whim, like some do with their credit cards.
What is it that my sister recalls? That’s the thing — she remembers assigned readings and the occasional good story, but more impressive for her are the serialized books with colorful covers. Her favorites are the stories riddled with social drama, the ones that discuss the Upper East Side, the complexities of prep school and the overwhelming temptation of always stealing a best friend’s boyfriend. She will read books that inspire, induce heartache and provoke thought, but then she will turn to Twilight and reread the same sexually infused passages over and over.
That’s not to say that the world has lost all of its influential writers. I want to kiss the hands of Neil Gaiman, Haruki Murakami, Mark Danielewski and Alice Sebold, among many others. Their presence in the literary world proves that the writer — despite the teachings of my sophomore year comparative literature class — is not dead. What has died, however, is this longing for the imaginary, this ability to jump into a jumble of pages and emerge a few hours later exhausted and fulfilled.
A book appears to be such an investment when compared to Facebook, Twitter, Youtube videos and Tumblr entries. But why? Why have we turned away from something that, as children, opened our very minds?
At the end of the summer, my little sister got what she wanted. She billed 100 hours and received a gift certificate to her favorite clothing store. But the loss is hers. Whereas she spends afternoons in air-conditioned, empty bliss, I spent days in Narnia, Hogwarts and the kingdom of Kyrria. She can’t collect dreams in jars with the Big Friendly Giant because, let’s face it — what dreams does she have to collect?
Tiffany Yang is a junior majoring in comparative literature. Her column, “Alphabet Soup,” runs Wednesdays.
It’s so sad that it’s so true.
But thanks for writing such a great article! And for reminding us to continue striving to be more than who we are
You go girlfriend!  Great article.  Even though journalism is dead, as you say, writing like yours is what keeps it alive.  Tell your sister to stop reading trashy novels and give her a copy of Jane Eyre, my fav.
Perhaps it is because I was an English Major @ USC nigh on 30 years ago. Perhaps it was because reading, whether fiction or non-fiction, was a central part of my upbringing. Or, perhaps, it is because my experience with “Generation Next” fully mirrors Ms. Yang’s. What Gen Next faces is not a crisis of intellect but rather one of imagination. If Harry Potter has finally trumped Swift, and “Tweeting” has displaced Eliot; I fear for the Republic. Fight On!

Eco-conscious students are calling upon USC to be a model of sustainability and to stop using coal in favor of greener energy sources.
Under the umbrella of the Sierra Club — a national organization — students launched the “Beyond Coal” campaign last week, which aims to reduce USC’s use of coal, thereby setting a precedent for other universities.
Eco-friendly · Students and members of the Sierra Club demonstrated last week in hopes of getting USC to end its reliance on coal for power. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
According to the Los Angeles Times, the Sierra Club reported that USC gets 43% of its energy from coal.
Matthew Oden, director of USC’s sustainability program, said USC has little control over its energy sources, as the school’s energy is contracted through the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
“A lot of people in our energy department at USC want sustainable energy and solar panels in this university,” Oden said. “The challenge is we’ve been in a contract with DWP where we can’t do that by law. It’s not that we don’t want to, we legally can’t.”
USC’s contract with DWP has been in place for 10 years. That contract, however, expires at the end of this year.
“A lot of people are working on this in our energy department, a lot of work is done to try and make this happen, but it has just never been an option until the end of this year,” Oden said.
William Sealy, a recent USC graduate and an organizer for the California Public Interest Research Group, said the group hopes USC will engage in serious talks with DWP about moving away from coal as they look to renegotiate their energy contract.
“The school can actively talk with the DWP about ways they can change their sources of energy, and move away from coal towards something more sustainable,” Sealy said.
Oden said that many people in the school’s energy department are working to try to move toward more sustainable energy sources and they hope to work with DWP at the end of the year, once the option is available.
“We are in the process of creating a new memorandum of understanding with DWP and that will determine our terms with them,” Oden said. “We are hopeful in working towards this and are looking forward towards a good financial arrangement.”
Mark Bernstein, managing director of USC’s Energy Institute, said he supports the students’ efforts to pressure DWP on using clean energy.
“DWP continues to need to be pushed, no question about it, but they are moving towards using less coal,” he said. “I don’t think USC has done enough, but we don’t have much choice — we have to buy their power. But we are exploring options to use solar panels and lower our energy consumption.”
According to Sealy, USC lags behind other universities that have taken more proactive steps in using clean energy.
“We can definitely increase our renewable energy sources here on campus — like the University of Pennsylvania that receives part of their energy from wind turbines, or Georgetown University which has a whole new building covered head to toe in solar panels,” Sealy said.
The Sierra Club’s “Beyond Coal” campaign is a nationwide movement, involving more than 60 campuses. The Sierra Club argues that universities have the potential to lead the nation into clean energy use.
“I think USC’s purchasing power and influence has the enormous potential to not only change its own campus but to also get the entire city of LA off of coal-generated electricity,” said Trieste Lockwood, the campaign coordinator for USC’s branch of the Sierra Club.
Locally, the “Beyond Coal” campaign also hopes to put pressure on Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who vowed in his second inaugural address to go coal-free by 2020.
“It was a really bold and ambitious announcement,” Lockwood said. “We’re here to hold him accountable and make sure he follows through.”
