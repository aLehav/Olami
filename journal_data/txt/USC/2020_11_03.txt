Time and time again, you’ve probably heard me mention the rapid growth of the older adult population in the next few decades. Nonetheless, it’s a reality that everyone must face. Modern medicine, from preventative care to increased health literacy, along with social services — the Administration of Aging and geriatric services — are some of the many factors contributing to such development. Seeing that the election will play an important role in the future of older adult care and services, let’s double down on the role that we can play as college students in the near future.
The world of aging does not limit itself to our discussions in academia or the skilled nursing communities that I referred to in my last column. Aging, in many ways, is a marketable and interdisciplinary field. Looking at the tech sector, there’s a clear and immediate need for gerontologists to help critique and develop simple and reliable technology geared more toward older adults. For the public policy and politically oriented folks, there’s room for advocacy on behalf of those diagnosed with Alzheimer’s or various forms of dementia. As mentioned above, knowing the fundamentals in the psychology of aging can open pathways to academia and research. For myself, I plan to head off to medical school — Caribbean or not, but probably the former — and pursue a fellowship in geriatric medicine soon after. In short, there’s definitely a niche or space for you. 
I haven’t even touched on the media and journalism side of aging. You might have seen initiatives to help preserve the stories of older adults through video interviews, university oral history archives or movies. One that often comes to mind is the StoryCorp program geared toward those diagnosed with some form of dementia, named the StoryCorp Memory Loss Initiative. Here, the stories of older adults can be shared to the StoryCorp project and are automatically uploaded to the Library of Congress collection in conjunction with the StoryCorp collection. Working in the Davis School of Gerontology’s Communication Office, I know that we have a handful of opportunities where we try not only to increase our presence in the world of aging but also to showcase intergenerational interactions at the University.
“But Lois,” you, the inquisitive reader asks. “Isn’t gerontology and the field of aging as a whole really just one massive interdisciplinary field that is working to better orient itself to the care and assistance of older adults?”
A weirdly specific question, but yes. The field of aging continues to be an incredibly complex and interdisciplinary field given its implications for almost every job sector. Even more, there’s an 18% increase in the number of older adults in our current workforce since 2015, illustrating the need and care these individuals may require once they opt into retirement options. 
However, I implore that you learn more about older adults before jumping into the field via trial by fire. Many can join the age bandwagon and dig out a niche in the field. Upon doing this, however, they might realize that working with the older adult population may not necessarily be their forte. So, here are a few classes offered by the School of Gerontology that could ease the transition or affirm your passion of helping older adults.
“Administrative Problems in Aging” provides some insight into the field of aging from an administrative standpoint. Currently taught by adjunct lecturer Tameka Brown, the class delves into topics such as working with and developing a human resources department, delegating responsibilities to coworkers and establishing a healthy work environment, all while taking older clients and employees into consideration. 
“Medical Issues of Older Persons: An Introduction to Geriatrics” illustrates the changes in preventative care and treatment of age-related diseases throughout history while also providing insight on the current steps being taken to tackle issues among today’s group of older adults. With Ed Schneider, professor of gerontology and Emeritus Dean of the Andrus Gerontology Center, it’s sure to be an exciting and fun class. 
“Neurobiology of Aging” with John Walsh, associate professor of gerontology and assistant dean of education at the Davis School, is another exciting class geared more toward the science component of gerontology, looking more at cognitive function and the nervous system.
There are plenty more classes in the gerontology school as well that you should definitely give a look, particularly Maymesters and some of the smaller two-unit classes.
Outside of taking those fun gero classes, try and find some opportunities to work with older adults where you’re able. At the moment, it might be incredibly difficult to find any in-person opportunities, or even hybrid volunteering, for that matter. That being said, many opportunities for getting involved or even just learning about possible careers in aging are being hosted by some clubs on campus. 
From the Student Gerontology Association to GeroTech to the Medical Gerontology Association, there are places that allow for interaction with older adults, albeit through Zoom or other means. Many older adults are learning to adjust to these new and constantly changing circumstances as they continue to stay indoors and hope the pandemic clears soon. Internships at institutes such as SCAN or the Milken Foundation at its Center for the Future of Aging can certainly give you a better look into how aging is being transformed and better understood.
Bringing it all together, careers in aging are for any and all majors, and the opportunities in this promising field are endless and malleable to your personal and professional goals. Hopefully by the time we’re older — maybe after retiring from a career in aging — we look back at the progress we’ve made for the field of gerontology and reminisce, saying, “Back in my day…”

With the election coming up, my focus for this piece was naturally going to be an extension of my last edition of this column: using empathy to solve political polarization. But I scratched it and whatever I started to write when I received the tragic news that my Dadi (grandmother in Urdu) had passed away in her sleep.
When this article comes out, it’ll have been four complete days. Four long days. 
But she’s in a better place now. Though she’s gone, she will never really leave me. Forever embedded in my heart, I’ll love and cherish our memories together until the end of time. Time truly does not wait for any man, but what we do with our time here remains in our control. 
So — choose love instead of hate. 
This is not necessarily a soft skill, but nevertheless a tool overlooked by many in times of fear and during trials and tribulations. Love conquers all, and I fundamentally believe that. So did my Dadi. In a world that almost ushers a need to be hateful, choose love and kindness. 
I don’t have much else to say on this matter. I could cite some stats or a study for evidence, but I say all of this from a heart currently healing from heartache. But writing is an escape, cathartic in a sense, that allows me to share what I feel. Excuse this mess of a stream of consciousness, but I had to write something down these past couple of days. 
All I know right now and all I really want to say is that love has no bounds. At the end of the day, love is all anyone needs, really — or, at least, all I need. 
My Dadi never got to read any of my work or see any of my pictures, but I hope that she’s proud of me regardless. This one’s for her. 
I love you, Dadi.

Allison Fiedler spends her day going back and forth between her bed and desk, trying to juggle family life and schoolwork. Instead of coming to campus, Fiedler decided to remain with her family and take classes from her home in Los Angeles as a cheaper alternative to renting an off-campus apartment. 
“As a freshman this is definitely not how I thought my first year would be going. It’s been as good as it can be,” said Fiedler, a freshman majoring in American studies and ethnicity. “I couldn’t really justify paying a bunch of money for an off-campus apartment when I have my house that’s 20 minutes away. I was concerned about getting coronavirus, and I wanted to be able to see my family and to be able to see people in my bubble and I would have not felt comfortable doing that if I had been in an off-campus apartment.”
In a message to the USC community, President Carol Folt announced that a mix of in-person and hybrid classes for the Spring 2021 semester would be contingent on L.A. County Department of Public Health approval. In addition, spring break would be canceled to limit the spread of the coronavirus and be replaced with a personal wellness day program to prioritize the health and wellness of students.
While plans to bring students back to campus have not yet been approved by L.A. County, Folt said the University was ready to begin implementing different preventative measures and social distancing guidelines for classrooms, libraries, labs and student spaces. If plans are approved, USC hopes to bring 5,000 students back to campus housing to live in single-occupancy rooms. Classes for the Spring 2021 academic semester will begin Jan. 15 and end April 30, with finals and exams concluding May 12. 
“At this point, we still do not have clearance from the county to resume on-campus activities beyond those already approved,” Folt said in a video message sent to the student body Oct. 14. “However, things are changing and we are very hopeful that if we take a few more weeks and work closely with the county, we will get permission to return to a more active campus life for the spring semester.”
Jack Johnson, a senior majoring in theatre, has been staying in an off-campus apartment this fall and expressed disappointment at the news. With Folt’s announcement, he hopes to be able to return to take some in-person classes in the spring, given that SDA classes are some of the smallest at the University.
“Obviously, I am kind of bummed that we’re not in person, especially for my last semester, but that’s OK because we’re gonna get through it,” Johnson said. “I understand that we gotta keep on track for our degrees, and the school is trying to do their best to get it done in a safe manner and respect authority.”
As a graduating senior about to enter the entertainment industry, Johnson said the online semester has impacted his academic and career plans.
“In a major that requires interaction with a lot of people in collaboration, and a lot of our curriculum is based around shows,” Johnson said. “It’s really hard for me to do work online and it’s hard for me to get motivated to do work since I’m in my apartment, which most of the time when I do work, it’s not in my apartment, it’s on campus, and especially without access to any of the lab spaces that we have.”
As of now, with limited information from USC and L.A. County, most students are having a hard time making plans for the upcoming semester. 
Meanwhile, Johnson is relying on the advice and recommendations of people close to him. 
“The biggest factors were what God wants me to do, … seeking wise counsel and specifically for last semester I remember I was praying about it a whole lot,” Johnson said. “I talked to a bunch of people and they said that I should probably go back to L.A. The last person that I asked was my dad, because I was most worried about his answer since both my parents have sacrificed a whole lot for me to go to school and I didn’t want to waste their money.”
On the other hand, Alyssa Delarosa, a junior majoring in psychology who is staying at home for the semester, relies on the news and government announcements when it comes to making decisions for the upcoming semester and whether or not she would move back to campus.
“It got to a point where what Dr. [Anthony] Fauci and other experts were saying was clashing with what USC was saying,” Delarosa said “Once it got to that point I was like ‘OK I’m gonna have to stop reading these emails sent by USC and look at the L.A. County guidelines and what they have’ and it was very much a stay at home order … that’s why most of us [students] don’t even read the emails anymore. We just like to stick to reading what L.A. County says and what Dr. Fauci says.”
While most people are still deciding their plans for the upcoming semester amid the uncertainty, some are already settling in on a final decision. 
Audrey Keeling, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, took a leave of absence during the fall semester to start an enterprise at home that pairs students with tutors for classes. While she is not optimistic about the feasibility of a hybrid semester, she is planning to return to L.A. 
“For me, finishing spring semester of last year online, I just had a lot of trouble with the online format … so that factored a lot into my wanting to take a leave of absence, and the semesters that I have at USC are so precious so I want those semesters to be on campus in person,” Keeling said. “For the sake of being with my community in college, I think it was good to take a leave of absence for one semester but I don’t know about doing it for a whole year.”

While Hollywood can be filled with drama, the only media-worthy shade in this piece is the shade of actors’ and actresses’ skin. Colorism. In the entertainment industry it appears that lighter skin takes precedence over all other factors, and when darker skinned actors are given opportunities, they’re superficial stereotypes.
Colorism isn’t something that came out of the blue, either. Hollywood began as a white-only industry, and when folks from marginalized communities were integrated and cast in lead roles, they had European features or were white-passing to continue its white legacy. Even while actors of color were available, white was — and still is — standard, so much that there is a list of “25 Times White Actors Played People Of Color.” With only three out of 10 lead actors in film being people of color, representation — especially for those who are darker skinned — should be a priority in the entertainment industry.
Even now, in shows that preach representation like “Grown-ish” with an all-Black cast, for a long time, there was a visible lack of darker skinned people, until Ryan Destiny was recently added in January, two years after the show’s start. This is a topic many overlook and while some aren’t aware of colorism in film and television, I think it’s time to talk about it, so who better to speak on the issues than Black and Indigenous people and people of color majoring in various aspects of the film industry at USC?
Colorism on screen is extremely prevalent in groups of people of color. In most films and television shows, lighter skin is favored and equated to the beauty standard. In the Latinx community, telenovelas and other programming feature those who are lighter, and for Jostin Soto-Garcia, an Afro-Dominican senior majoring in cinema media studies, this didn’t represent the diverse community he experienced every day.  
“All the people there [in media] were fairly fair skinned, whether they were Dominican, Puerto Rican, Mexican — and even though a lot of the time they sounded like us and they spoke like us, they didn’t exactly look like us,” Soto-Garcia said.
This is even seen in blockbuster movies such as “Crazy Rich Asians,” where while everyone was celebrating an all-Asian cast, diversity of skin tone and background was overlooked. This was the case for Matt Oflas, a Filipino sophomore majoring in film and television production, who later realized that he couldn’t see himself in the highly acclaimed film.
“When ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ came out it was such a huge thing for me, and now that it’s been a couple years and I’ve had time to reflect on it,” Oflas said. “I look back on that film, and I don’t see myself that much … They did have a Filipino character in there, but it was a side character.”
This tends to happen a lot when books are turned into films, much like in “The Hate U Give,” which features a darker skinned Black girl on the cover, and stars Amandla Stenberg, a lighter skinned actor. Once Sade Famuyiwa, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, realized that the film didn’t have personal representation like the book had, her anticipation for it diminished.
“On the cover of the book was a darker skinned girl, but they cast [Stenberg], and [that] made me not as excited about the film,” Famuyiwa said. “I probably would have been, if they actually did cast a darker skinned girl for that role.”
Though Hollywood and the media have the tendency to favor lighter skin, when darker skinned people are cast, they are usually in roles that are inferior. For Black actors and actresses, this has been the case for centuries like that of Hattie McDaniel as Mammy — a housemaid — in “Gone with the Wind” or Octavia Spencer as Sue Ann — a childless maternal-like woman in “Ma.” 
“For us, Hollywood was always white, light skinned,” said Destinee McCaster, a sophomore majoring in film and television production. “When it did involve Black people, they were viewed as the slaves or the helpers or the assistants or the supporting characters, and that’s kind of been so consistent and just modernized over and over again in Hollywood. It’s never been reformed or deconstructed.”
And all the while darker skinned people are put in roles that are subservient, or more antagonistic, the same ideas are being perpetuated in animation. This can be seen in Disney’s “The Proud Family” where school bullies, the Gross sisters, were drawn in darker shades of blue, or in “Mulan” where the Hun tribe were drawn in dark shades of gray.
In the media industry, European beauty is seemingly the marker of marketability and what many believe sells to a larger audience. The telling of white stories for peak viewer relatability, though, obviously doesn’t act as representation for every person.
“Hollywood is a business, so they have to sell to the majority audience and their audience is mostly white,” Oflas said. “If we want to tell relatable stories that will appeal to major audiences, we need to have actors and characters on the screen who look like these audiences.”
There has been the argument made that if television shows had main characters that were played by people of color that it wouldn’t be marketable to large audiences because it would be considered too niche or culturally deep for everyone to understand. What doesn’t make sense though is every other community that isn’t white has grown up watching television shows that have white protagonists and storylines, and while that was the majority of programming, most found it relatable. 
In times where people from underrepresented communities are featured in films, they are usually in a supporting role opposite a white protagonist like Frozone in “The Incredibles” or Ned Leeds in “Spiderman: Homecoming.” In the case of the Netflix series the “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,” Sabrina’s best friend is a Black woman named Rosalind Walker, and for some, her inclusion was questioned on the basis of diversity or clout.   
“It’s still very ingrained in people to expect a non person of color to play main characters, especially supporting characters,” McCaster said. “There’s like a supporting character curse, in my opinion, for people of color … It balances that line of making progress on something, but then you always wonder whether that progress is to gain followers or to be there to show that … these stories should be told.”
Outside of the side-character curse, it also seems as though the same actors are cast over and over again. In many recent young adult films and shows, much of the casting of Black women has been given to lighter skinned actresses, again playing into that narrative of light skin seeming more palatable to audiences. This is especially disheartening when there are talented darker skinned actresses out there, and, as Amara Chimezie, a sophomore majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation pointed out, many opportunities too.
“[Zendaya has] been given opportunities that a darker skinned or racially ambiguous woman of color would not have been given,” Chimezie said. “Whenever we’re looking at a Black woman in Hollywood, it’s always Zendaya and Amandla Stenberg and Yara Shahidi … It definitely affects what kinds of people are getting different opportunities [and] which kinds of opportunities.”
Funnily enough, both Stenberg and Shahidi have been featured in films that were under fire for whitewashing the darker-skinned characters that were in the books: “The Hate U Give” and “The Sun Is Also A Star.”
Though colorism may seem like an issue that finds its way on screen and through representation, it also bleeds into the way society operates and how people view others. It influences how people from marginalized communities are perceived in real life, especially by people who aren’t from diverse communities and don’t have the opportunity to interact with different groups of people; many are reliant on media for this.
“Coming from [an] immigrant community in New York, to achieve a certain level of social mobility, or assimilation, here in this country, you have to go into white spaces at some point, because that’s where the power structure lies,” Soto-Garcia said. “Whereas those who were already born into that world and social circles with that privilege, [they] don’t have to know what the other one is.”
Subsequently, when organizing a method to make USC a better experience for other students, Famuyiwa found that the alumni she had reached out to were more attentive to her lighter-skinned counterpart. She felt that she was being perceived like the “Angry Black Woman” stereotype, which, in turn, made her feel even worse. 
“It felt like we were both giving really important ideas for change, but she was just taken more seriously, despite the fact that we were both Black and dealt with [similar] experiences,” Famuyiwa said. “Sometimes I’d be really passionate about something, and people would interpret it as angry because I’m not light skinned.”
With representation of Black, Indigenous, and people of color being so sparse, especially for those who are darker skinned, change is a priority for many underrepresented groups in the film and TV industries. 
Chimezie, along with many others, hopes to create stories with accurate representation where people from underrepresented communities aren’t featured in the same stereotypes and tropes continuously, but can have unlimited storylines like many white actors and actresses have.
“I’m sick of seeing the only person who looks like me, or is Black, on screen is getting shot by the police or they’re a slave,” Chimezie said. “I just want to see stories where Black people are happy and chilling, or have a crush on a boy, or are living or going to a magical school or have superpowers. I just want to see those films. So, I’m just gonna make those films for all Black people.”
For marginalized groups in the film space, as much as representation in front of the camera is important, so is representation behind it. The best way to explain this is with the 2020 Disney film, “Mulan.” While the film was telling the centuries-old story of a Chinese woman with Asian leads, the creative team was full of white people including the director, screenwriters and costume designer. How can a group of white people accurately tell a story about a community they are not from? They can’t.
“There’s obviously an issue there,” Oflas said. “And I think that needs to change. Because once you get minorities and people with darker skin colors on the creative team behind the camera, they’re telling these stories. They’re the ones making these stories authentic. They’ll be able to tell it in the most authentic way.”
This is extremely important for people like Oflas who may find themselves in spaces where they, along with a few others, may be the only people in a room that look like each other. Oflas, who is in a cohort with about 60 other people, mentions how he is only one of three Filipinos there, so it was important to form a community to network and bridge the gap of being an underrepresented person in that space.
“I found those people and I became really close with them [and] I just created a community,” Oflas said. “[It’s important to create] those circles in those communities for storytellers of color to support each other, interact with each other and work together to create these stories and represent the people who look like us.”
Darker skinned Black and Indigenous people and people of color shouldn’t have to remain in the shadows of their lighter counterparts. We need to see representation of skin tone on screen and behind the camera so that these stories are accurately told. What isn’t fair is the lack of darker skin in Hollywood … oh, and the diverse actors and actresses Hollywood will start casting too, right?

As the fall semester continues virtually, students and clubs are struggling to recreate the in-person atmosphere of their activities. While navigating an online semester with remote meetings, practices and bonding events, some clubs and organizations are seeing significant decreases in membership and engagement due to the virtual platform. 
One cause for this could be a result of many students finding difficulties navigating the virtual involvement fairs that occurred over six days from Aug. 18 to Aug. 27. 
Lisza Lo, a freshman majoring in accounting, said she had a hard time deciding which clubs to join because of the online format. The unconventional splitting of the involvement fair, with clubs attending different days, further added to the confusion.
Typically during the involvement fair, clubs and organizations set up booths around campus and students can roam around and explore the different options with all of the information being presented to them in an accessible manner. 
“I actually had to individually search up the clubs I wanted to join to see which involvement fairs they were attending and when their orientation meetings were,” Lo said.
Hannah Doerr, co-director of Break Through Hip Hop said that membership in the club decreased due to members graduating and a smaller turnout to auditions than previous semesters.
“There’s normally a dance team involvement fair that’s just for the different dance clubs, so we didn’t get that this semester,” said Doerr, a sophomore majoring in economics and mathematics. “We did hold auditions but we didn’t get as big of a turnout as we usually do.”
SC Outfitters president Elizabeth Fedde, a senior majoring in business administration, said the outdoor student group recruited a large number of guides in anticipation for the usual high demand for trips, before knowing their outings would need to be canceled. 
To prevent Zoom fatigue, SC Outfitters decided not to have extra meetings on top of students’ classes, but that consequently means low engagement and membership compared to most semesters, according to Fedde.
“We’re not trying to turn our club into a virtual club,” Fedde said. “We’re really just trying to maintain engagement and maintain the stoke for getting outside and doing our part to get there sooner.”
The virtual format has also limited the value and rigor of some professional clubs, with members feeling like the quality and excitement of meetings or special events with guest speakers has decreased. Angela Cheng, a junior majoring in business administration, said she felt less involved in her club activities because of the lack of social engagement that extracurriculars usually provide. 
“I feel like I’m less inclined, or I don’t want to attend as much as [I would] in person because I feel like I was just in class on Zoom,” Cheng said. 
Karen Abe, a sophomore majoring in media arts and practice, joined Break Through Hip Hop this semester and said the recording process can sometimes feel like added work, with members having to film themselves and submit the recordings.
“I do like dancing, so it doesn’t feel like it’s a whole lot of work, or it’s a strain on you,” Abe said. “It definitely seems like extra homework on the side, because we have to film on our own.”
To maintain member engagement while offsetting Zoom fatigue, some club officers have organized various social events, providing members with opportunities to take a break and build relationships within the club virtually. 
A popular team-building game has been Among Us, an online multiplayer game analogous to the popular party game Mafia, where there is an impostor who must kill off the other players while hiding their identity. Break Through Hip Hop and a cappella team Asli Baat have been taking advantage of the rapid popularity of the game to build trust and camaraderie among their members. 
“I can tell that like a lot of the board members put in a lot of work to ensure that they provide members with opportunities to connect,” Abe said. 
With more uncertainty surrounding the spring semester and the virtual format continuing at least until the University receives clearance from Los Angeles County officials to approve in-person activity, some students have expressed a willingness to continue with their clubs because they allow some social aspect or ability to gain professional experience while classes remain online.
“As a transfer student,” Abe said, “I feel like coming into school virtually, with no USC friends, gave me a lot of social anxiety and a lot of worries that I wouldn’t be able to integrate myself. I can tell how a lot of USC students are really trying to keep these clubs alive and help new students get the best out of this Zoom experience.”
Some club officers have started creating contingency plans depending on whether the spring semester will be virtual or in person. They have emphasized the importance of adhering to L.A. County guidelines and basic public health precautions regardless of USC’s decision to reopen the campus.
Whether the semester continues virtually or in a hybrid format, some clubs such as SC Outfitters will need to resume some meetings to train members for future semesters. 
“We’ve decided that if we’re also virtual next spring, we will 100% be doing virtual training because we can’t just not train them for a year,” Fedde said. “In the case that we do get to open up and lead some kinds of trips, we have already outlined precautions that we would take to do so.” 
Doerr said clubs will need to continue changing to meet guidelines and find safe ways for students to participate no matter the format. 
“If things are hybrid, we’ll always have the option of people continuing to do it online if they want to, but we will hopefully have some in person [activities],” Doerr said. “Whatever [the public health guidelines] are at the time, we’ll just adapt to that because everybody’s health is our first priority.”

Black students have historically been told that the only way they will be able to achieve excellence is if they are “twice as good” as other (white) students. That gives them no margin of error — small mistakes turn to big mistakes and, when taken as an aggregate, can ruin already slim opportunities. 
It is not an ideal situation for any Black student. That being said, it is unsurprising in that it is in direct alignment with the systematic racism and oppression that has plagued Black people since the start of slavery. From slavery grew segregation — a concentrated attempt to stop any Black students from acquiring employment, higher education and the overall freedom to move through society unencumbered by prejudice. 
This dates back to the 1954 case of Brown v. Board of Education, a landmark Supreme Court decision in helping motivate universities to allow more Black students and eradicate segregation. Since USC’s early days, the University has tried to find itself on the right side of humanity by promoting racial integration: In 1907, USC conferred its first degree to a Black man, John Somerville.
Opening up the gates for Black students to strive to attend prominent universities both by setting precedent and overturning racist policy helped instill the (still understated) sentiment that they deserve to be in those classrooms. Of course, these strides in social justice do not mitigate the pressure and stereotypical threat that often comes with navigating those classrooms and managing frequent microaggressions as a Black student, from professors’ conspicuous surprise at one’s admission to doubts in a person’s ability to retain information and understand difficult concepts.
By the time Black students can take honors or accelerated classes in middle school and high school, they are already prepared to have to be better than others that are privileged enough to do less work and still receive the benefit of the doubt. A Black student will often push themselves harder to avoid the ridicule and discrimination they could suffer. 
In the Fall 2020 USC student demographics report, out of the 46,000 students that attend the University, only 5.5% are Black. This clearly demonstrates that there is still ample room for improvement when it comes to recruiting students from underrepresented communities. Moreover, it cannot be stressed enough that it is not the responsibility of Black students to overcompensate in hope of gaining admission — it is the responsibility of institutions to rectify the systemic oppression inherent to its structure. 
The saddest part is that these same students will one day leave their respective universities, degree in hand, ready to attack the uncertain job force that awaits them. Many of these students will then start to see how the concept of working double the time and putting in double the effort will manifest and linger in the professional world, despite their clear qualifications. They will be constantly reminded that other candidates who apply for the same job can be under qualified but still receive the position because of their race. This reinforces that Black candidates have to go through a more challenging and rigorous process to get noticed by their desired employer. 
Harvard Business School conducted a study to examine how candidates from marginalized communities “whiten” their resumes, which involves omitting information such as hobbies, names and membership of organizations that would directly identify them to a particular race, to receive callbacks for an interview. Twenty five percent of the Black candidates who whitened their resumes received a callback, compared to 10% of those who included details that indicated they were from an underrepresented community. It is absurd that such a candidate would have to leave out certain details to increase their likelihood of getting a job — that is blatant, unadulterated racism that perpetuates the misguided idea that minority applicants should subvert their identities to get ahead.
Not to mention, the added stress and discouragement of being constantly reminded as a Black student that the only way to get an opportunity and maintain it is to put one’s best foot forward at any given moment and go above and beyond whenever possible is exhausting and debilitating. White or white-passing individuals do not have to face these internal struggles because they do not have any reason to think their efforts or contributions will be interpreted in an idiosyncratic way. The hard work Black students must put in to even the scales does not eliminate these stereotypes — it actually perpetuates them.
On that note, it is integral that workplaces and schools continue to broaden their work of acknowledging implicit biases and the discrimination that is built into these systems. Stereotypes must be unlearned, both at the hands of these institutions, who must actively work to mitigate these effects, and at the hands of the Black students implicated, who should never feel like they have to prove themselves beyond what any qualified candidate or student would. 
As the world continues the difficult dialogue of racism in the United States, a conversation that has been once again cast into the spotlight in the aftermath of the killings of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and many more at the hands of the police, it is imminent to address the systemic racism that permeates education and the workplace. 
One can only hope that fairness and equality will become the main (and only) factors in measuring the qualifications of a Black student and that this will carry on to their professional careers. Going to extremes to be accepted as qualified simply to mitigate racial prejudice should never have been the standard, and it is absolutely essential that all schools and workplaces take action to make sure it never is again.

The road to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 has been a wild one, to say the least. Coming off the monumental success of the PS4, Sony is the current market leader, while Microsoft is the “underdog.” This fall, both companies will stake their claim in the next-gen race. With all their cards finally laid out, it’s time to preview the different consumers’ options. 
Strategy
In terms of strategy, PS5 is continuing its focus on epic first-party titles while Microsoft is banking on consumer-friendly services, rather than just hardware.
For the first time, both tech giants are releasing multiple console models. Sony is selling two PS5 models that will release Nov. 12 in the United States: the “base” model ($499) with a physical 4K UHD (ultra-high definition) disc drive and the “digital” model ($399) without a drive. Besides the optical drive, both PS5 variants have identical specs. 
Microsoft also offers two consoles, but its models vary in power. On Nov. 10, Microsoft will release its own two consoles: a higher-end Xbox Series X ($499) and lower-end Xbox Series S ($299). While both are branded “next-gen,” the Series X is the true powerhouse, with the Series S lagging in specs and lacking a disc drive.
Specs
Out of the four “next-gen” consoles, the Series S is the weakest link. Despite a great CPU, it cannot produce 4K gaming or even approach the other next-gen models’ graphical fidelity. However, both Xbox models provide robust backward compatibility.
Both the PS5 and the Series X bring 4K gaming at 120 fps to consoles and even support 8K. However, Series X has a small advantage with its 12 teraflops of GPU (graphics processing unit) compared to PS5’s 10.28. That difference will result in a slightly higher graphical fidelity, making Series X the most powerful console. However, Sony’s partnership with Unreal Engine 5, a next-gen graphics engine, possibly makes up that difference.
Services
For years, Microsoft has been praised for its services. Now, the company’s big plan moving forward is its game subscription service, Xbox Game Pass. Costing a mere $9.99 per month, it offers an incredible slate of downloadable games for Xbox and PC — it’s the Netflix of gaming. 
Including blockbusters such as “The Outer Worlds” and “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,” Game Pass also adds Microsoft first-party studios’ games on day one. With next-generation games becoming even more expensive ($70 launch prices), Game Pass is the most economical deal in gaming.
Against Microsoft’s formidable consumer options, Sony’s services falter. PS Plus is solid but not as secure as Xbox Live. PS Now, Sony’s subscription platform, does not provide first-party titles on day one, boasting a less impressive catalogue. Gamers cannot download titles either, needing a secure Internet connection to stream. 
Launch line-up
Third-party titles like “Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla” and “NBA 2K21” will be available for both consoles at launch.
In terms of first-party exclusive games, Sony easily blows Microsoft out of the water. After “Halo: Infinite’s” — well, infinite — delay, Series X lacks any big launch games but promises upscaled performances for previous titles. In contrast, PS5 boasts anticipated games right at launch: “Demon’s Souls” and “Spider-Man: Miles Morales,” among others.
Without a doubt, Sony has established itself as the king of exclusive narrative experiences this past generation. So, PS5 will continue popular franchises while bringing new ones from world-class developers. But the future is promising for Xbox; Microsoft recently acquired many talented developers, including the legendary Bethesda, so this could level the playing field, but it may take years.
Final verdict
So, which console should gamers buy this fall? Well, the answer is complicated — it depends on the gamer. While it may be more affordable for consumers to get the Series S, the console will soon be dated. On Microsoft’s advantage, Game Pass offers families an economical option — whether it’s on current-gen, next-gen or even PC. 
However, the PS5 digital edition will be the best value for a truly “next-gen” console. Unlike the Series S, it’s on par with next-gen specs and still priced $100 cheaper than both the Series X and PS5 base. And Sony’s exclusive content is unparalleled, which may be the ultimate deciding factor. 
With all that said, there isn’t a massive need to get either of these consoles right now. All launch games will be available across current-gen. It will take another year, at least, for games to become exclusive to new hardware. And with the pre-order craze, there may not be many consoles left in stock. The smartest option may be to save up for a next-gen console sometime next year.

The NCAA is seeing a massive influx of coronavirus cases recently. For instance, the Big Ten restarted its season only last week, but some players contracted the coronavirus already, causing the postponement and cancellation of some games. 
After my hometown Kansas native Graham Mertz put on a record-breaking performance for the No. 9 Wisconsin Badgers in Madison with five touchdowns and 248 yards against Illinois in a 45-7 win last week, Mertz became the first positive test on the team and is now out for at least 21 days. 
Unfortunately, the virus spread throughout the team, with the number of cases on the team currently up to 22, according to Bleacher Report. Now, the Badgers’ following game against Nebraska has been canceled, and there is a high probability that other matchups could get canceled or postponed as well. In addition, it has also been reported that their opponents, the Fighting Illini, now have logged two cases. 
Traveling down south to the SEC, No. 1 Clemson star (and future New York Jets quarterback) Trevor Lawrence has tested positive, missed Saturday’s game against Boston College, and will also not be available for Clemson’s game against our favorite rival, No. 4 Notre Dame this upcoming weekend.
These cases and outbreaks are not a good sign for the Pac-12 and USC, who are starting their season this weekend, as the No. 20 Trojans go up against Arizona State at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
Los Angeles has the second-largest metropolitan area by population in the United States at about 13,000,000. Even though currently the daily positivity rate in LA County is at 3.3% and has been gradually decreasing thanks to the local and state governments, increased travel by these teams because of these games can pose significant risks to the LA area. Consequently, the likelihood of transmission in the local community could increase after the Trojans and the Sun Devils play at the historic Coliseum. 
Additionally, even if USC takes all possible measures, it will be important for every other team to follow the same standards. For instance, our public counterparts in Westwood have a game two weeks from now against Utah at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. If they are not taking strict precautions, including rapid testing, proper isolation and sanitizing efforts, either team can easily get infected and transmit the virus across the conference in the following weeks. In my previous columns, I wrote that, compared to most other conferences, the Pac-12 has many schools located in major metropolitan areas such as Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles; therefore it is critical that schools take measures seriously, especially in light of the outbreaks at schools located in less populous areas. 
The main way to stay safe is by conducting daily, reliable testing of all players, staff, and other personnel, and the Pac-12 plans to do exactly that.
“It’s very aggressive,’’ Commissioner Larry Scott said of the Pac-12’s testing program. “But it gives us the best chance possible to get through the season with a minimum number of lost games.”
However, such reassurances are not the be-all, end-all. Let’s take a look at what Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren said before his conference’s restart: 
“We needed the time. I am so pleased with where we are now compared to August. We’ve used the time wisely, and I feel prepared,” Warren said when asked by the Chicago Tribune about his confidence in the season restart. “I’m looking forward to the Big Ten dominating college football this weekend.”
Although the Big Ten certainly had exciting games in its first week, such as the Mertz showcase against Illinois and Indiana’s shocking upset against then-No. 8 Penn State, several coronavirus cases rained on the parade.
Still, at the moment, I have some level of trust in USC and other teams in the conference to learn from the mistakes of the others and try to take as many precautionary measures as possible. Still, don’t be surprised if cases start arising after this weekend — the rest of college football has shown us how volatile and unpredictable this virus can be.

After a season including the unexpected death of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant alongside his daughter Gianna and seven others in January, coupled with the uncertainty of life during the pandemic, this championship meant more. Despite being in a bubble atmosphere rather than the traditional setting of Staples Center, the victory energized fans across the city, giving a glimpse of hope in a tumultuous year. 
Celebrations erupted as large crowds gathered in downtown Los Angeles as LeBron James and Anthony Davis took the microphone during the post-game celebration in Orlando to speak on the significance of the win. The triumph was special not just for James, who picked up his fourth championship and finals MVP award, but for co-star Davis, a first-time champion. 
After losing their hero in Bryant, fans in L.A. have been in search of a victory this year. Fireworks and cars screeching downtown were loud and clear when the clock struck double-zeros to make it official that the Lakers were once again champions. Almost a decade after their last title win, fans flocked to Staples Center as a sea of gold and purple jerseys filled every crevice of downtown L.A. Those fans intentionally ignored the warning of officials instructing fans to celebrate inside at home and adhere to social distance guidelines.  
The impact of the championship was felt by students right here at USC as well.
“Los Angeles is a city that needed a win,” said Reagan Griffin Jr., a sophomore majoring in journalism.  “And when I say Los Angeles, I don’t mean Hollywood or Beverly Hills. I’m talking about Crenshaw. Inglewood. Compton. The heart and soul of L.A. — they needed this.” 
L.A. has been an epicenter of a pandemic placing mental, physical and financial uncertainty onto the world. Now, people are looking to climb their way out of it, and Griffin, an L.A. native, said the Lakers provided encouragement. 
“This is a group of people who’ve been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic,” Griffin said. “A group of people who are forced to reckon with the social injustices of this country during every waking moment. A group of people who have lost heroes, from Nipsey Hussle to Kobe Bryant. They needed this. And the Lakers got it done.” 
Other students were present in their Zoom classes the following Monday in head-to-toe Lakers gear. Skyler Trepel, a graduate student studying specialized journalism, was one of those students. He was front and center in all his classes with his white “24” jersey and Lakers hat. Trepel spoke about how the feeling still has not worn off. 
“I’ve been a die-hard Laker fan since 1998 when I was 5 years old as Michael Jordan and a young Kobe Bryant went at it in the All-Star game on my fifth birthday,” Trepel said. “Kobe and the Lakers have been with me through every time in my life. They were there for the good, the bad, the ups and the downs. I can remember where I was and what I was going through in my life for every significant moment in Laker and Kobe Bryant history.” 
Trepel is from Winnipeg, Canada and won’t be in L.A. until coronavirus restrictions loosen up. But he affirmed that didn’t change the magnitude of the Lakers’ championship for him as he feels more connected to the city than ever before.
“Being from Canada, the Lakers became a huge part of my identity and what made me stand out in a country that mostly identifies with hockey,” Trepel said. “It’s been a decade since their last title, but this one means more than basketball. Multiple generations grew up with Kobe and the Lakers — they represented the work ethic and the positive mindset, that challenges are an opportunity to grow and get better. Kobe was my hero and this championship was a reminder that his legacy will live on forever.” 
On Tuesday, Oct. 27, the Los Angeles Dodgers became the 2020 MLB champions.
Dodgers fans were finally able to rejoice as their team ended the 32-year drought without a title. The seventh-overall championship might be the sweetest, especially with the recent World Series losses to the Boston Red Sox in 2018 and Houston Astros in 2017. However, at times, the regular season was far from sweet.
The season originally scheduled for March 26 was, of course, postponed. The MLB and MLA Players Association negotiated into June, but finally agreed to a 60-game schedule, far less than the normal 162-game season. 
The acquisition of outfielder Mookie Betts elevated this already loaded lineup to a patient crew of batters with the potential to pop off at any second. They finished the season with a 43-17 record and lots of momentum, winning 10 of their last 12 games.
After steamrolling through the Milwaukee Brewers and San Diego Padres the first two rounds of the playoffs, a date was set with the Atlanta Braves for a shot at another World Series. The Braves took a 3-1 lead in the series, but the Dodgers, led by big plays from Betts and outfielder Cody Bellinger, won the next three to advance. 
The Dodgers, with the second-highest payroll in the league, faced the Tampa Bay Rays with the third-lowest. Nevertheless, the Rays put up a fight pushing the Dodgers to six games. 
Ultimately, USC fans who were heartbroken in 2017 and 2018 finally felt relieved this time around.
“I was definitely more relieved than other years that we lost. I was a little sad that I couldn’t be there, because under normal circumstances I would be there,” said Jordan Tuchin, a junior majoring in political science. “But now we finally got the win after a long time. So it’s really great.”
Tuchin, who was quarantined in his dorm room, thought about flying out to Texas to watch the final games. However, the memories of prior Dodger losses impacted his decision.
“I sort of wish I’d went to Texas, but I am a little superstitious when it comes to sports,” he said. “And I thought maybe if I flew out it would be a waste of time if they lost because I’d just be so sad and I would be in Texas instead of at my home where I kind of recover from it.”
The victory, however, was marred by the positive coronavirus test of Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner. His return to the field to celebrate with his teammates stole some headlines away from the Dodgers’ impressive performance. 
Nevertheless, Dodgers World Series merchandise sold out in record time after their victory. A city that has been through so much this year was ready to celebrate yet another championship.
Abi Thomas, a junior majoring in creative writing, has lived in L.A. her whole life. Sports has always played an important role in her household, so she was overcome with joy when the team she’s supported since middle school finally won it all. 
She said that for her home city, this year’s World Series meant more than just a seventh championship.
“Given everything with COVID and all of the riots and everything going on socially, L.A., I feel like when they win something like this, it really brings everybody together,” Thomas said. “I think that having the Dodgers winning really is more of a solidarity thing.”
The last time both the Lakers and Dodgers won a title — 1988. L.A. is a city of champions once again brought together by two fantastic teams.
