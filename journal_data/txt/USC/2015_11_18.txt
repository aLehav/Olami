Seeing red · USC College Republicans hosted Ben Shapiro, editor-at-large of Breitbart and founder of Benjamin Shapiro Legal Consulting ,Wednesday. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
The USC College Republicans hosted Ben Shapiro, editor-at-large of Breitbart and founder of Benjamin Shapiro Legal Consulting, who spoke about anti-Semitism on college campuses across the United States.
“I’m here specifically to talk about the attempt to stop the Jihad,” Shapiro said. “I’m here to talk about what’s going on on campuses across the country like USC, where idiot leftists are doing idiot things, which is what they always do.”
Jacob Ellenhorn, president of the College Republicans, said that it is important that his club bring “controversial speakers” like Shapiro to campus.
“USC and the administration is not interested in bringing diverse speakers to campus,” Ellenhorn said. “They’re interested in bringing speakers who represent the major viewpoint on campus and not really bringing anyone else. That’s evident through the speakers USC has brought in the past. I think that unless there’s a drastic change in campus culture, nothing’s going to change.”
Shapiro began by saying the left has the tendency to accuse people who speak the truth of being racists, bigots, homophobic or Islamophobic. He then explained what he identified as the two goals of the left: ending Islamophobia and destroying Israel, which he went on to argue demonstrates a moral contradiction.
“Israel is a democracy,” Shapiro said. “For all of its flaws, Israel is a significantly tolerant country compared to any other country in the Middle East. Israel is a beacon of liberty in a region of darkness, and if you’re going to go after Israel and you’re going to take out everything Israel does and call it a brutal human rights violator, in order to do that, you have to remove all the context — the context being the region in which Israel exists and the people with which Israel has to deal.”
Shapiro said the left ignores the fact that Islamic countries are not supportive of other tenets of its agenda, such as gay rights, abortion, women’s equality and women’s suffrage.
“These are not places leftists would like to live,” Shapiro said. “If you were to take the LGBT club on campus and plop it down in the middle of Saudi Arabia, it would last all of two minutes. If you were to take the feminist club here and dump them in the middle of Iran, that would not be a pleasant experience. The average lifespan would diminish largely.”
Shapiro argued that the left needs to understand that the United States will never be taken down by Islamic radicalism because Western civilization is too powerful. According to him, the U.S. is the most powerful country with an extraordinary military force. He emphasized that if the United States were to be defeated, it would be defeated not by forces of radical Islam, but by a left that allows it to win.
The conversation then moved to President Barack Obama and the left’s concern over rising Islamophobia. Shapiro argued that, for the left, equality of outcome is the only thing that matters, not equality of opportunity or behavior; the left’s idea is that if one country is successful and another is not, the unsuccessful country must have been exploited.
“Believing [in] equality of outcome means you end up siding with people who are bad. The truth is, as a general rule, [if] you make responsible decisions, you tend to end up with a better outcome. This is true internationally and this is true in your personal life as well,” Shapiro said.
Shapiro spoke about what he believes is fueling rampant anti-Semitism in the United States. The left, which according to Shapiro is largely based on Marxism, looks at Israel and sees an outpost of Western colonialism: Israel has money, high-rises, and nightclubs — things that Shapiro said leads the left to believe that Israel must have exploited someone.
Additionally, Shapiro argued that evil is not just “something out there fostered by the actions of psychopaths.” In his opinion, evil comes from a place that is common: ideology. For radical Islamists, he claimed that their “ends-justifies-the-means” ideology leads to them performing evil in order to achieve “Islamic utopia.”
Toward the end of the discussion, Shapiro talked about U.S. involvement in the Middle East and its implications on the expansion of ISIS.
“Obama is a very dangerous man for Israel and the United States,” Shapiro said. “If the U.S. had not pulled thousands of troops out [of] the border meant to contain ISIS, chances are lower that ISIS would exist [in this extent] today. The question is what to do now, and the left’s favorite thing to do before calling you a racist or a bigot is shouting out ‘Bush’ at random intervals.”
“[I]diot leftists are doing idiot things, which is what they always do.”
Quite a bit of projection there, Ben.
The meltdown in the Middle East is partly the responsibility of Shrubya, and partly our indefensible policy towards Israeli apartheid.

The Onion was unpeeled yesterday during a presentation and Q&A with the satirical publication’s Editor-in-Chief Cole Bolton and Managing Editor Ben Berkley.
“It is an absolute pleasure to be here in your finest chemistry room,” Bolton said, immediately bringing the crowd to laughter. “We are America’s finest news source. The history of The Onion is the history of America itself.”
After fabricating a laughable story about The Onion’s fictional 1765 origin, Bolton and Berkley launched into a both satirical and informative discussion about tips for success in the professional arena.
The two had many suggestions for students looking to get ahead. They suggested finding internships that give back, such as deforestation. Additionally, they stressed the importance of finding a passion, providing humorous “sample passions,” such as scooping, carnival litigation, telling others about your volunteer work and lions. Finally, the crowd of students burst into laughter when these two tips for success flashed up on the screen: be born white and male, and be born with assets exceeding $2.3 million.
All jokes aside, the editors explained what goes on behind the scenes. The company is based in Chicago and has 12 full-time writers and editors. Fifteen hundred headlines are pitched every week, and approximately 30 are chosen. The Onion’s writers are used to having their ideas shut down.
“Every last thing starts with the headline,” Berkley said. “There are no articles that are written in full and sent to us and submitted.”
There is a meeting held once per week during which the writers present a list of headline ideas. Many of them are rejected until they find the perfect fit, one that is eye-catching and surprising. They don’t go for the easy jokes, the ones that have been used repeatedly by other news sources. Bolton and Berkley said the greatest headlines have nuanced angles that aim to entertain and enlighten people, not trick them. The editors want people to understand the joke so they are interested and will read the story.
“There’s always people who are just going to read the headline,” Bolton said. “It’s just quicker that way.”
Though there is a lot of thought that goes into each headline, the writers are looking for funny stories that are rooted in truth.
“We just trust the writers’ room,” Berkley said. “We’ll follow stupidity wherever it goes.”
In addition to headlines, visuals are very important for the story, the editors said. The graphics department adds a level of depth to each story. Berkley also praised the writing staff.
“Our writers go through hot and cold streaks,” Berkley said. “These are obviously very good writers. Might even say great. They are getting ripped to shreds every day. They have a lot of self-doubt moments, but they ultimately push through it, which makes them admirable and much better writers.”

Syrian journalist and feminist activist Yasmine Merei addressed USC students and faculty about her work to improve conditions for women in Syria on Wednesday as part of the event, “Spotlight on Syria: Women Under Siege, hosted by the Dornsife Middle East Studies Program.
Merei is the managing editor of Syrian magazine Saiedet Souria, which translates to “The Lady of Syria.” Created in hopes of educating Syrian women, the magazine has introduced several campaigns in hopes of empowering and assisting struggling Syrian women.
“[We started] the magazine [after realizing] that there is no other magazine talking about women,” Merei said.
In January of 2014, Merei and her team released the 44-page first issue. Currently, each magazine has around 60 pages, and Merei’s team has grown to include writers from six other Arabic countries. Saiedet Souria has five locations in Syria, an office in Egypt and headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey.
“We try to focus on [women’s rights] and publish essays about the positive experiences of Syrian women outside [and] inside Syria,” Merei said. “We also [reach out to] women who were arrested inside the prisons of the regime, to document the time they spent there.”
One project that the magazine heavily emphasized was called “Bawh Nesaie,” which allowed women from both sides — those on the side of the Al Assad regime and those on the side of the opposition — to anonymously tell their stories.
“We brought 17 women from Syria and Turkey [and trained] them to write,” Merei said. “We want women to know the others — that they are suffering in the same ways. We want women from the two sides to know that all of us are losing, all of us are a part of this war in one way or another.”
Merei said that she and her team distribute the magazine in the most dangerous areas of Syria: among these are the camps in northern Syria and many of the places under siege. Over the past year, they have printed and distributed more than 120,000 copies.
“We are reaching women who have no electricity, no internet access,” she said. “You could say they are ‘out of the world.’”
In addition to creating this publication, Merei, with the help of others, has led campaigns such as “Child Not Wife,” which aims to prevent families from marrying off girls under the age of 15 and to promote schooling as an alternative. The Saiedet Souria organization has also provided schooling for uneducated women between the ages of 20 and 60.
The organization has gained funding from different European groups, including the Swiss government and the European Endowment for Democracy, to promote these campaigns.
Furthermore, with funding from a Swedish Organization called “Women for Women,” Saiedet Souria has established pharmacies in areas under siege, such as a suburb of Damascus and in the city of Daraa. Merei said that because the Assad regime doesn’t allow people to go in or out of these areas, it is almost impossible to bring food or medication. These pharmacies provide medical attention to pregnant women and women with infants.
For these efforts, Merei was forced to flee her home three years ago, after being marked “wanted” by the Al Assad regime. Merei said she was targeted because Syria has banned journalists from documenting the situation. After being reported, Merei’s mother convinced her to leave Syria to avoid arrest; she traveled to As-Suwayda, a city in southern Syria, to Lebanon, where she stayed for two months, and then to Turkey, where she settled.
“I didn’t know where to go. I cannot remember [anything] specific that I was thinking about,” Merei said. “You feel you are losing everything and that you are feeling only afraid and you have to find somewhere to go.”
However, Merei continues to help from outside Syria, distributing the magazine online and promoting political participation and better living conditions among women.
“We want them to sit together and exchange ideas,” she said. “[We want to] let women know about their rights and where they need to be in the future.”
Through her work on the publication and on the many campaigns that she has spearheaded, Merei said she has realized the extent of struggling women’s strength.
“I don’t want to say [that] in Syria, we have only weak women,” Merei said. “A lot of women are [struggling] to survive, they are suffering, they have no houses, a lot of women lost their sons, their husbands. But we have a lot of women who are very strong, who are looking for peace, who [are] thinking about [re]building Syria and dreaming about Syria without Assad, without ISIS, without radical groups, without weapons.”
For this reason, she hopes to continue working with women in areas of Syria outside the regime and keeping in contact online.
After leaving Turkey, Merei became a 2015 Feuchtwanger Fellow at the Villa Aurora in the Pacific Palisades. She will return to Turkey at the end of this year to continue her work.
USC students, faculty and community members were shocked and impressed upon hearing about Merei’s work.
“This was my first actual exposure to someone who experienced the Syrian refugee crisis,” said community member Nancy Dinh. “So it was very moving to me to hear her personal encounter and [to hear] where she is today. I was really appreciative of the fact that she was brave enough to speak about her experiences.”
Correction: This article previously spelled the “Bawh Nesaie” project as “Bawn Nesaie.” The article has also been updated to reflect that the event was hosted by the USC Dornsife Middle East Studies Program.

The Association of Innovative Marketing Consulting, a student organization that provides marketing services, is trying to create a safer environment on campus. AIM was hired by the Los Angeles Police Department to create campaigns centered on three issues on campus: sexual assault, alcohol awareness and bike safety.
AIM has taken on this challenge and begun to raise awareness about these issues by utilizing social media and planning interactive events. This month, AIM is coordinating a “Month of Change” campaign.
“The LAPD did not set particular guidelines, so we had to set goals on what we wanted to achieve through this campaign,” said Eduardo Melchior, the consultant for the sexual assault campaign.
Melchior explained that his team worked to bring awareness to sexual assault on campus by focusing on bystander education. According to USC’s campus climate survey on sexual assault and misconduct, 75.7 percent of students who said they were a bystander to sexual assault or misconduct did not act. The findings from this survey drove the Sexual Assault Awareness team to help educate the student body on how to react to sexual misconduct.
“It is scary to think that so many people are not doing anything when others are being sexually assaulted,” Melchior said. “The ultimatum is to create a safe environment where victims can feel comfortable to come out. We also want people to feel safe from being sexually assaulted.”
The theme of the sexual assault prevention campaign is Helen of Troy. Students interested in participating in this campaign are encouraged to visit the Helen of Troy Facebook page and the website, iamhelen.com.
The likelihood of sexual assault is often increased by alcohol. Given that, AIM has also worked to bring awareness to alcohol safety. The Alcohol Safety campaign targets freshmen.
“We realize that when freshmen come to school, they may have never been exposed to alcohol in this way before. They may not be aware of their own tolerance levels,” said Udai Chopra, a member of the Alcohol Awareness team.
The Alcohol Safety Campaign has already hosted events at Parkside Arts & Humanities and the USC vs. Arizona tailgate. The event at Parkside was the Party Smart Carnival. Students were invited to eat free food and play games that engaged them in alcohol education. One of the games included a mixology booth, designed to teach students how much of a certain drink should be poured to make one cup. Another game was called “take a shot.” Students were challenged to shoot a basketball from different distances. The farther away a student stood, the more difficult it was to make the basket, signifying how alcohol impairs coordination.
“The line for this event was out the door. We had a good turnout. Our priority is to make our events fun and educational,” Chopra said.
The Alcohol Safety campaign also set up a station during the tailgate called “Trojans, Think Before You Drink.” AIM handed out water bottles and KIND bars to students. The goal was to teach students how to drink responsibly.
“It is very strategically planned. We target freshmen and want to create a culture of drinking responsibly,” Chopra said.
The third campaign promoted bike safety on campus and consisted of three parts. The first was the “Awareness Campaign” in which AIM wrote statistics about bike safety in chalk around high-traffic areas. The second was “Operation Firefly” in which the team posted flyers about bike registration, proper methods of parking and effective bike-locking techniques. The third was “DPS Bike Registration.” AIM encouraged students, faculty and staff to register their bikes at a booth set up on Trousdale Parkway. Registering a bike with the Department of Public Safety allows a stolen or lost bike to be returned if found.
“A lot of bikes on campus are not registered. Even if DPS finds a bike that has been stolen, there is no way of getting it back to you because it is not registered,” Chopra said.

With injustice plaguing their dystopian future society, the world is calling for a symbol of hope. In the last film in the Hunger Games franchise, based on the best-selling series by author Suzanne Collins, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) serves as an inspiring emblem for those fighting against oppression. Fans will witness the end of the journey they have taken with these beloved characters, including Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth).
Lawrence’s character has evolved from an altruistic fighter to the “Girl on Fire” to an indomitable symbol of hope in the midst of the ongoing rebellion against President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the Capitol. Katniss refuses to be a pawn in Snow’s manipulative games and decides to take action into her own hands, with the rest of the rebel Squad 451 group. However, the battle is far from over until this epic finale with tension-filled final scenes.
Lawrence, who has shined as the main character for three years, described the process of letting go of the movies that defined her career as one of the most influential actresses in Hollywood.
“I feel that I had two endings with Katniss. One when we wrapped the film in Berlin … [which] was kind of saying goodbye to the movie and then I had a moment with my nephews about a year later. They played my children in the scene we shot,” Lawrence said. “It was an amazing closure to this character.”
Though the filming of Mockingjay is now over, Lawrence said she still holds on to the character.
“The feeling of accomplishment will happen more when the film finally comes out,” Lawrence said. “I didn’t really feel like I said goodbye to [Katniss].”
After the film, fans will also not feel ready to let go of Katniss and her comrades. Compared to the written characters from the book series, the re-envisioned trifecta of Katniss, Peeta and Gale give viewers a whole new outlook on bringing change to a disintegrating world — a current real-life concept that is filmed in a post-apocalyptic setting.
Hutcherson’s character Peeta also plays a major role in restoring hope in Panem. Peeta goes through periods of a perplexing dual nature that cause him to undergo waves of demented fury due to his memory being hijacked by opposing forces. Once criticized as a static character, Peeta was applauded by film producer Nina Jacobson for his growth throughout the last film.
“[Peeta] starts reconnecting with Katniss, step by tiny step, [which] is, in a way … very touching,” Jacobson said. “Your heart breaks for him, but you see that he has a chance to return to who he was, even if nothing will ever be the same.”
After being introduced to the Games, the audience knows that nothing will ever be the same for these characters, who have been exposed to war and extreme poverty, among other disasters that have befallen Panem. However, regaining their down-to-earth identities through camaraderie and friendship with others against the tyranny of the Capitol, including new members like Cressida (Natalie Dormer) and Boggs (Mahershala Ali), makes their cause even more worthwhile.
However, Katniss and Peeta seem to have a better grasp on their beliefs than Gale. Hemsworth described the moral issues that his character battles in addition to the extremity of his physical combat.
“For a long time, he didn’t really have any power to do anything,” Hemsworth said. “For this last part, he’s front and center, and he’s able to really make an impact. I think it all kind of goes to his head a little bit, and he loses sight of his own morals and values.”
The biggest takeaway audience members will receive from these three characters is how to stay true to themselves during global disorder. With their humble and meager beginnings from District 12, Katniss, Peeta and Gale are ready to tackle the previously shimmering and idealistic Capitol that houses President Snow, who enjoys toying with the Mockingjay. Katniss’s fierceness symbolizes the rebellion needed after the 75-year tradition of unnecessary bloodbath.
Lawrence said she wants viewers to emulate her character’s courage, which they have grown up with and seen throughout the previous movies.
“I hope that everybody’s going to take away something different from each film as they get older,” Lawrence said. “Our audience will grow and learn more or see more of themselves or see more of what they want from this world or this country.”

Admittedly, studying abroad gave rise to a series of fears. Along with learning to adapt to a new country and lifestyle and making new friends, I had another equally potent fear: losing touch with the friends and family I left behind.
This fear stood at the forefront of my worries in July, when I began my adventures in Melbourne. I realized that it is very easy to take advantage of proximity — when you see friends on a daily basis, there is a limited need to make a message or call. Or maybe it’s just me — I don’t have a need to constantly be on the phone, or at least I didn’t need to before I came here. Though some people I know saw their phones as an extension of their limbs, my phone was a burden, so much so that I had lost a total of six phones before starting school here.
I have always struggled with being the one to reach out. And sometimes that struggle has caused me to drift from friends. I noticed this especially when I started college. In my first semesters at USC, I became fixated on my experience, ensuring I was fully present as a student in L.A. The occasional — and by occasional I really mean semi-annual — text was the extent of my outreach to those friends who did not live within a two-mile radius. Between me and my roommates, our communication through cell phones centered on cleaning responsibilities. Needless to say, I am dependent on face-to-face contact.
Naturally, my lackluster approaches caused me to lose touch. I have seen friends come and go, but with those that remain, each time I see them it is as if no time has passed. But studying abroad proved a new challenge. Suddenly, the proximity advantage disappeared. I worried that studying abroad on a different continent would make me irrelevant.
Thus, studying abroad forced me to call my habits into question. I had to make an effort to maintain a relationship with those friends where the majority of our contact depended on proximity. I knew I needed to reform my ways. My ambivalence about communication would have to adapt accordingly.
When I first came to Melbourne, I made a concerted effort to text friends and make the occasional phone call, relying on anything from reminders on my phone to physical elements around me to signal that though those friends might not be near, our relationship still remained. The system worked for quite some time, until I realized that there were times I had to kindly ask friends if I could put our shared life on hold in order to be fully present in the study abroad life. Maybe it was selfish, but it was only a small request
from a true friend.
When it comes to staying in touch, balance is key. Every so often, it’s important to catch up and send the occasional text or Snapchat. This can go a long way in keeping up with friends. It signals that I am still a part of their lives, though I am on the other side of the world.
Parents will, over time, understand if they are not getting a call everyday. I’ve found that the best way to keep my parents happy is to send pictures every few days and message them when I get home from a night out. I have been able to stay in contact with family members by strategically calling during holidays. That way I can talk as much as I want in a single sitting.
Ultimately, I consciously made an effort to share less and listen more. There will be a time and a place in the future for me to share my experiences camping in Tasmania or dancing in the street in Gold Coast. By asking about their lives, I can not only gain insight into what’s happening back home, but also let them know that I am available to listen, even in a different time zone.
If anything, studying abroad taught me just how to deal with keeping in touch. I have exchanged my fear with a
well-learned lesson. Now, just as I needed to stay in contact with friends and family back home, I have to do the same to keep the friends I have made while abroad. It is impossible to imagine my experience here without a cell phone. I now know that even if I spent the full six months away without saying a word, that would just mean more sharing upon my return. But having a cell phone, FaceTime, Snapchat, WhatsApp and every other application goes a long way in reconnecting.

Anybody’s game · Both the Trojans and the Ducks are riding a four-game win streak heading into Saturday’s matchup and both teams are 7-3, getting off to bad starts but improving since then. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Interim head coach Clay Helton had the Trojans focus on three key aspects for their match-up against Oregon during practice Wednesday: ball security, third down efficiency and pass rush. For ball security, Helton’s key is to both protect the ball from Oregon and to cause turnovers on defense.
“You cannot give an extra possession to a dangerous Oregon offense,” Helton said.
On third downs, Helton would like to see the team continue to improve efficiency on both offense and defense. That will mean converting key third downs and shutting down Oregon in those situations to end the drive and get their defense off of the field.
In the last five weeks, the Trojans have had 19 sacks, which is something that Helton would like to see continue. For that to happen, Helton wants to see continued improvement with the defense’s pass rush.
“It’s a continued point of emphasis,” Helton said. “Something that we’ve committed to for the last five weeks.”
While continued strength from the defense will be key for the Trojans to come out with a win in Eugene, not having freshman inside linebacker Cameron Smith and senior inside linebacker Lamar Dawson since they suffered season-ending injuries at Colorado makes this difficult.
To fill  the void in the middle, USC has freshman Uchenna Nwosu, sophomore Olajuwon Tucker and juniors Michael Hutchings and Jabari Ruffin.
“We’re kind of experimenting,” Helton said. “Training multiple guys.”
Defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox spoke a bit more on Nwosu following practice, saying that he’s a tremendous athlete.
“He’s got good instincts,” Wilcox said. “He gets better the more he plays.”
Tucker, who has nine tackles this season, will probably be making a bigger impact on the field these final two games, but he isn’t feeling too nervous as the Oregon games draws closer. He’s looking forward to stepping up to the challenge both individually and as a team.
“I think it’s going to be a great physical game,” Tucker said. “The tougher team is going to win.”
Wilcox also praised redshirt senior defensive tackle Delvon Simmons.
“[He] is playing his best football,” Wilcox said. “He’s gotten better. It’s not by chance he’s improved.”
Looking forward to Oregon, Wilcox emphasized the Ducks’ tempo and how the Trojans are looking to step up to the challenge.
“Obviously they’re firing on all cylinders,” Wilcox said. “[They’re] playing really efficient[ly].”
Sophomore running back Royce Freeman will test USC’s recently improved run defense. Freeman has 1,392 yards this season, 12 touchdowns and averages 6.6 yards per carry.
Even though the Trojans are facing the conference’s top rusher, Wilcox isn’t approaching the game any differently.
“Every guy you line up against is the best player you’ve ever played against,” Wilcox said. “When you take that mentality — with technique and effort — you play well.”
Helton addressed the recent ups and downs of the kicking this season. Though he said kicking has been “spotty,” he praised Alex Wood for making two field goals against Colorado.
“I get a little frustrated when he kicks the ball out-of-bounds on the kick off,” Helton said. “But it’s something that we’re working hard on and trying to improve.”

Tigers vs Trojans · The Women of Troy will face Princeton in the second round of the NCAA tournament on Friday. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The women’s soccer team will take on Princeton in the second round of the NCAA Tournament Friday.
The Women of Troy  (15-5-1) are coming off of a dramatic win over Cal State Fullerton in the first round of the tourney. USC downed Fullerton on penalty kicks after a 3-3 draw. Midfielder Morgan Andrews scored a hat trick in the game but knows there is still work to be done, especially on the defensive side of the ball.
Against Fullerton, the defense allowed three goals, the most it has let in under head coach Keidane McAlpine in his two seasons at USC. However, Andrews feels this first postseason game simply gave USC the chance to clear out some of the cobwebs. In fact, Andrews praised the team’s defensive prowess.
“Everyone is a defender first,” Andrews said. “You’re always going to find that one case of the forwards who don’t want to defend — except on this team.”
USC’s defense has been outstanding this season, with goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme conceding well under a goal per game.
USC’s central midfielders, like Andrews, backtrack and work incredibly hard on defense. So do the wingers, which is important for a team playing a 4-3-3 formation, as extra defensive support in midfield is essential.
The offense carried the team through the first round and proved to be enough to put away a talented Fullerton side. Looking ahead to the Princeton clash, Andrews stressed that the team will need to take advantage of its opportunities by generating quality shots.
“It just comes down to finishing opportunities,” she said.
Andrews has been integral to the team’s success this season. With five goals in the last two games, the junior has further legitimized her first team all-Pac-12 status. The goal-scoring machine is part of a dynamic midfield corps that also includes Mandy Freeman and Nicole Molen.
Freeman’s defensive shape and organization will be important for USC against a Princeton team scoring more than 2.5 goals per game.
Friday’s contest will feature two high-powered offenses. USC’s attacking moves against Fullerton were borderline unstoppable, as the Women of Troy generated 33 shots on the afternoon.
The USC-Princeton game will be played in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Tigers  (14-3-1) lost three straight in early September but then got their season back on track.
Princeton finished first in the Ivy League and was able to carry its momentum from the regular season into the NCAA Tournament. The Tigers took care of business in the first round, defeating Boston College 4-2.
USC will be favored, but this is a new era for Princeton soccer. The Tigers were a mediocre 7-6-3 a year ago, but first-year head coach Sean Driscoll has his team on quite a run at the moment.
The Tigers’ last NCAA Tournament appearance came in 2012. This is Princeton’s 11th postseason appearance in history. This will be the first time Princeton and USC will have collided on the pitch. In fact, the Women of Troy have only faced one Ivy League team in program history, which came in the form of a 2-0 win over Harvard in 2006.
The game is set for Friday at 1 p.m. in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The Pac-12 finds itself on the outside looking in after both of its one-loss teams — Stanford and Utah — suffered dramatic defeats. The losses mean the Pac-12 is guaranteed a conference champion with at least two losses. As of now the only other conference guaranteed a champion with one loss is the SEC.
The ACC, Big Ten and Big 12 all field undefeated teams. The ACC has the best shot at an undefeated team in Clemson. The Tigers already defeated their two biggest opponents, Notre Dame and Florida State. The only thing standing between Clemson and the College Football Playoff is most likely an ACC Championship showdown against the red hot North Carolina Tar Heels.
The Big Ten has two undefeated teams left in Iowa and Ohio State. However, Ohio State still has to play Michigan State and longtime rival Michigan. The conference is most likely looking at a one-loss conference champion. Something really weird would have to happen for the Big 10 to have a two-loss champion.
The Big 12 has the best chance of a two-loss team. Baylor, Oklahoma, TCU and Oklahoma State all have to play each other. This week’s games feature Baylor (8-1) vs. Oklahoma State (10-0) and TCU (9-1) vs. Oklahoma (9-1). The following week features Oklahoma vs. Oklahoma State and Baylor vs. TCU. The Big 12 also lacks a conference championship game, which could come back to haunt them should Notre Dame finish with one loss — to No. 1 Clemson.
Many, especially the media that covers the Pac-12, are looking for reasons as to why the Pac-12 will be left out. One writer claimed that the Pac-12’s nine game conference was to blame. However, I feel that it is the opposite. The conference schedule is just as grueling as every other conference. The biggest difference between the  Pac-12 and the rest of the country is that the Pac-12 schedules quality     non-conference opponents.
For example, this year’s   non-conference schedule included the likes of Michigan (8-2), Texas A&M (7-3), Michigan State (9-1), Notre Dame (9-1), Northwestern (8-2) and BYU  (7-3). Those teams are a combined 48-12 (80 percent winning percentage) this season. The Pac-12 is a combined 2-4 in those games with Stanford still having a matchup with Notre Dame on the schedule.
In comparison, this year the SEC’s biggest schools, Alabama and LSU, found their toughest non-conference opponents in Wisconsin (8-2) and Syracuse (3-7). ’Bama and LSU also played against FCS opponents. Their other non-conference opponents featured Eastern Michigan, Western Kentucky, Middle Tennessee and Louisiana-Monroe.
The Big 10 is a little better about their scheduling, but their undefeated teams, Ohio State and Iowa, played Virginia Tech, Western Michigan, Northern Illinois, Illinois State, Pittsburgh and North Texas out of conference. Pair that  out-of-conference schedule with an already weak conference slate and it’s easy to see why Iowa and Ohio State are undefeated.
The ACC also boasts a rather weak out-of-conference schedule. Besides Clemson facing Notre Dame and Florida State annually taking on Florida, the conference heavyweights hardly face anyone. Division-leading North Carolina’s only loss is to South Carolina (3-7). Their other   non-conference opponents were North Carolina A&T, Illinois and Delaware.
We shouldn’t even get started on how weak the Big 12’s out-of-conference schedule is. The hardest opponent the Big 12 faced out-of-conference was Minnesota (4-6). The other opponents on the schedule? Lamar, Rice, SMU, Central Arkansas, Texas-San Antonio and Stephen F. Austin.
You can see quite a discrepancy in the quality of opponents that the Pac-12 schedules relative to the other Power 5 conferences.
The Pac-12 goes by the motto “The Conference of Champions.” It stands by that motto by actually scheduling quality opponents. You won’t see the likes of USC, Stanford, UCLA and Oregon playing against FCS opponents in Week 11 like Alabama will this weekend when they take on Charleston Southern. In fact, those four teams combined to play one FCS opponent — Eastern Washington.
The College Football Committee has promised to reward teams for strength of schedule. Unfortunately, it looks like the committee won’t be true to its word this year. It’s hard to imagine the committee picking a two- or three-loss Pac-12 champion, who played a tougher out-of-conference schedule, over the likes of a one-loss Big 12, Big 10 or SEC champion.
Regrettably, the non-conference slate gets even tougher next season for the Pac-12. USC will play both Alabama and Notre Dame; Stanford will play Kansas State and Notre Dame; UCLA will travel to take on Texas A&M; Oregon will visit Nebraska. The Pac-12 records would probably look a lot nicer if the teams were playing FCS opponents instead.
It seems that the Pac-12 will continue to be on the outside looking in until the committee decides to actually reward teams for scheduling quality non-conference opponents. For now, the conference of champions will have to settle for the Rose Bowl.

The Trojans hosted their first-ever outdoor wrestling match against their rival Bruins at Brittingham Intramural Field Wednesday evening. The Trojans lost 27-19 to the Bruins, their first loss of the season. They are now 2-1 after opening the season with wins over UC Merced and Cal State San Marcos.
Uhhh, how about holding dual meets indoors? That mat was new, and slippery. Plus it was cold and there was moisture in the air. The wrestlers were slipping around on that mat.

Last week, Palestinian-American professor Steven Salaita reached an $875,000 settlement with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign after being fired in 2014 for tweets criticizing Israel’s assault on Gaza. Though his incendiary tweets were biased, the university was entirely unjustified in firing him — not as a matter of Israeli-Palestinian relations, but as a matter of free speech and academic integrity.
Salaita was offered a tenured position in the UIUC American Indian Studies Program in 2013, and had quit his job, moved his family and was ready to begin work in two weeks. On Aug. 2, 2014, however, the university notified him that he was being terminated. In addition, former UIUC Chancellor Phyllis Wise pointed out that, because she had not yet referred his hiring to the board of trustees and he had not begun the job, he was in fact simply not being hired.
In response, there were student walkouts and around 5,000 academics from various institutions pledged to boycott UIUC, according to USA Today. Many students and staff described the situation as one limiting academic freedom and free speech, and shortly afterwards Wise resigned from her position, citing “external issues.”
In a blog post explaining Salaita’s firing, Wise stated that he was not being fired for his criticism of Israel, but for his “personal and disrespectful words or actions that demean and abuse either viewpoints themselves or those who express them.” University officials believed, given the tone of these tweets, that Salaita would not be able to create a positive academic environment.
Salaita, however, is a respected and distinguished professor, with a reputation among his students of being fair and open-minded. His Twitter feed also included tweets expressing solidarity with both Jews and Arabs, clarifying that he would not “conceptualize #Israel/#Palestine as Jewish-Arab acrimony.” To claim that a few select posts from his personal Twitter account indicated an inability to teach effectively is insulting to academic professionalism.
Salaita was not inciting students to violence, nor was he singling out individual students and staff based on their individual beliefs, both of which would have been cause for concern for the university. He was stating his personal opinions regarding a controversial topic — vitriolic opinions, but not “hate speech,” as Josh Cooper, a then-senior at UIUC who petitioned against Salaita’s hiring, claimed.
Even more disconcerting is evidence that the influence of wealthy UIUC donors may have contributed to his firing. Several emails that have been released following his hiring indicate that several members of the university’s “President’s Council” — alumni who have donated more than $25,000 — emailed the administration saying they would rescind their support of the university if Salaita was hired. One graduate of the business school, for example, said, “Having been a multiple six-figure donor to Illinois over the years, I know our support is ending as we vehemently disagree with the approach this individual espouses.”
While dealing with donors is a necessary element of the economics of academia, allowing donors to decide which opinions are allowed on campuses create an artificial and incomplete educational environment. It is the responsibility of academic institutions to cultivate a safe and productive dialogue on difficult issues, not to placate anybody with financial pull and a dissenting opinion.
Bigoted speech surely does not have a place on college campuses. To fire a professor over taking a strong, potentially controversial position on a contentious issue is questionable at best. But to fire a professor after singling out particularly fiery tweets to craft an anti-Semitic narrative, giving in to pressure from wealthy donors and justifying the decision over a hiring technicality, is a clear violation of free speech, and calls into question the integrity of the academic institution. Had this professor created a hostile classroom environment, it would have been an entirely different matter. Prematurely firing him assuming he would do so goes against everything that a university should stand for, and he deserves everything he received from the settlement.
Steven Salaita, whose anti-Zionist/Semitic tweets and uncivil rants cost him a position at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), used a recent appearance in Philadelphia to portray himself as a victim of the Zionist lobby. The lecture was co-sponsored by Jewish Voice for Peace, which the Anti-Defamation League calls “the largest and most influential Jewish anti-Zionist group” in the U.S.
An audience of about forty attended the rambling lecture at the Wooden Shoe, a dingy, dirty anarchist bookstore that sported pro-Boycott/Divestment/Sanction (BDS) and other far left propaganda, including a poster of the brutal Marxist killer Che Guevara. Salaita’s claim to fame rests on UIUC’s 2014 decision not to install him as a professor of Native American studies. He and UIUC announced a settlement on November 12 that awards him $600,000 and legal costs; he will not seek or accept employment at the university.
Despite his ostensible field of specialty, the bulk of Salaita’s work consists of attacks on Israel, often under the guise of comparative history. It will surprise no one familiar with Salaita’s ideas that his most cited work, The Holy Land in Transit, which offers a “comparative analysis” of Native Americans and Palestinians, portrays American colonists, ancient Hebrews, and modern Israelis as brutal colonial settlers who engaged in genocide.
Now ensconced as the Edward W. Said Chair of American Studies at the American University of Beirut (AUB) for the 2015/16 academic year, Salaita told his Philadelphia fans that he is someone “who just got fired” because academe is not really about “true” academic freedom. Were this not the case, he could not have fallen prey to the “Zionist lobby.” He proceeded to mock and mispronounce the names of pro-Israel philanthropists Haim Saban and Sheldon Adelson. To great applause, he described as “kickassery” the efforts of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), Faculty for Palestine, and other pro-BDS groups who publicly defended him and lauded Jewish Voice for Peace for their PR work on his behalf.
Settling into what is clearly a well-worn routine, Salaita claimed that while he won’t be the last victim of the lobby, because “the Zionists have lost the argument in the public sphere – it’s done,” he and his groupies can win the hearts and minds of the American public. He said that his case represented the point at which all oppressed groups could unite and proclaim, “F— this! We have been put down long enough and we are not going to be afraid to utter the words Palestine.”
Moreover, he asserted that “academic Freedom never fulfilled its inherit promise” because it doesn’t allow for individuals like himself to express their views. Institutions pressured by Zionists are criminalizing his views, which he claims—against all evidence—are “scholarly” and “objective.”
The enthusiastic audience hung on every hackneyed cliché Salaita fed them, especially his repeated attacks against Zionists, whose actions he deemed so indefensible that they must resort to the purely defensive tactic of deflection. He added, mendaciously and mockingly, “you will never find a group of people who love China and Tibet more than the Zionists.” He is obsessed with Jews, and his phraseology revolves around “Zionists” as connoting an anti-Semitic trope and not merely Israel, whose legality as a nation state he persistently downplays and questions.
Salaita’s alleged martyrdom is the subject of his newest book, Uncivil Rites: Palestine and the Limits of Academic Freedom. Yet his repeated insistence that academic freedom does not apply to “pro-Palestinian” voices is simply absurd. Both overt hostility to Israel and anti-Semitism under the guise of anti-Zionism have for years dominated the field of Middle East studies, a fact illustrated by the standing ovation Salaita received at the 2014 annual conference of the Middle East Studies Association (MESA), which also voted toaffirm the right of individuals and organizations—including MESA—to support BDS resolutions.
Salaita’s meteoric rise as a leftwing cause célèbre rests precisely on his vitriolic views, grounded as they are in anti-Semitic conspiracy mongering rather than rigorous, objective scholarship. No one has a “right” to tenure, nor to freedom from the consequences of his behavior. When professors who substitute agitprop and rank propaganda for scholarship are seen for the charlatans they are rather than the principled victims they pretend to be, academe can start down the long road to reclaiming its
Other than the fact that he is an anti-semite, in fact proud of being so, your article is still filled with half-truths and unfair insinuations.
You should probably be fired as a journalist.

On this past, particularly austere, Friday the 13th, global terror threat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant coordinated a series of four separate shootings and three different suicide bombings throughout the heart of Paris and in one of its suburbs. The attacks resulted in at least 129 fatalities, 352 injuries, a declared state of emergency and the closure of France’s borders. The terror attack, the deadliest in France since World War II, was deemed by French President Francois Hollande “an act of war” that he would avenge in a fight that “will be merciless.”
The War on Terror, even if it is not an explicitly American war on terror, has returned. But this time, the landscape is different. The American populace has seen behind the veil of the NSA and the looming threats of the security state, yet has also had to face the horror of radical jihad in real-time. Texts from hostages being kept within the Bataclan, the Parisian theater in which individuals were massacred by three terrorists -— resulting in 89 murders — were being reported by media outlets throughout the world. People who secured their safety in the city were able to check in as “safe” on Facebook. Parisians running through the streets posted updates to Twitter about where to go and where to avoid. Perhaps most inventively, Parisians were able to find safety in the homes of strangers by using #porteouverte on multiple social media channels. But this was not the new battleground that we found. These were ingenuities found in moments of mortal peril. The new turf that both the U.S. public and the enemy have found is as simple and potent as hashtags and filters.
During the attacks, ISIL wasted no time in claiming responsibility and celebrating the attacks on Twitter with an Arabic hashtag translating to “Paris burns.” Aside from the obvious insanity that these monsters could be celebrating the massacre of innocent civilians, there is the added insult that they used our own invention against us. Twitter is ours. It is a product of the democratic liberalism and celebration of free speech and expression that ISIL has so vehemently tried to decimate. ISIL hijacked our own invention.
We stepped up and fought fire with fire. We put French flag filters over our Facebook profile pictures. We Instagrammed photos of the Eiffel Tower. We cluttered our Twitter feed with #vivelefrance and #prayforParis. Despite many cultural critics claiming that these acts were either in vain, or even worse, purely vain attempts to appear sympathetic, we had to do these things. Hashtagging and posting was just as much to express our extreme sadness for the victims as it was to show ISIL that they can kill our people, but they will never kill our spirits. Certainly, we will never change our lives out of fear of men who blow themselves up for eternal salvation.
Just days after the attacks, Parisians still smoke Gauloises and drink carafes of wine outside of cafes. ISIL did not attack symbols of the government, like the Élysée Palace or Hôtel de Ville. They attacked a bar, a rock concert, a football game and a shopping center. They wanted to attack the vitality of liberal culture. They’re terrorists; they want us to retreat with fear.
Seventy million people posted dedications to Paris on Instagram within a day of the attacks. These posters included Christians, Muslims, Jews, atheists, conservatives, liberals, socialists, libertarians and everyone in between. Over 200 countries in total were represented because ISIL is not waging a war just against the West. It aims to attack and oppress people around the world who believe that individuals have a right to choose how to live their own lives. Those individuals can become, and many of them have become, a part of this fight through the equalizing power of the internet. Perhaps it is a small, effortless measure of solidarity against a global terror threat with an estimated $2 billion in funding, but those with access to social media have a moral obligation to show ISIL that they can’t hijack what belongs to liberalism and individualism, be it Twitter or simply a night out on the town.
Our countries have fought a war on terror before. It was long and arguably didn’t accomplish much. It may sound petty to say that “doing your part” includes changing Facebook profile pictures, but the battleground has changed. In the age of social media, people around the world are exposed to image after video after soundbyte of people fleeing bloodshed and running for their lives, all while these villains celebrated on our terrain. If ISIL wages war against the right to freely associate and enjoy oneself, and tries to use social media against those who created it, individualists have to do what we can to take it back. It may be a small act, but it also may be the weapon that we did not have last time.
s a French person, being currently in Paris, I would liek to add my 2 cents to this article (maybe to spark a debate in the States, that is already undergoing in France? who knows.)
The Internet was undeniably valuable during these attacks. I was 100 km away from Paris and for some reason my Le Monde push notifications weren’t working. It was a quiet Friday night, I believe I was actually ready to go to sleep after an exhausting week. I was doing multiple things at once, watching a TV show, answering a couple emails, and browsing Facebook. And there I saw it: someone posted in one of our school groups that there was a shooting going on in Paris. I was shocked. At first I thought it was just trivial (crazy people with guns exist on both sides of the Atlantic after all), but I immediately called my family in Paris to check what was going on. After they confirmed the craziness of the situation, I turned on the live feed of Le Monde, and started watching live coverage on a news channel — both on the Internet. Internet proved extremely useful: although I was away, I felt like I was living this with my city, I was understanding –there was no lag of time between what was happening and the moment I knew it, which is both reassuring and terrifying: 20 years ago, I would have learned about the attacks in the morning paper. On Friday, I was watching live, but it also created a climate of incredible fear both in my appartment, in Remis, the city I was in, and on social media.
Yes, social media was incredibly useful during the attacks. #PortesOuvertes let people find shelter in a time of incredible panic. I was able to let my loved ones know I was safe almost instantly, by messaging them, posting a status, and checking in as safe. This is great and it reassured a lot of people.
But social media was also really good at creating false rumors: you’re even reiterating one in your article (and no worries, you’re not the first journalist I see doing this)– the shooting in Les Halles was never confirmed, just a mere rumor going around on Facebook. The same way, no on duty policemen died during the shooting, nor are there still hostages in the Bataclan (believe it or not I saw this in an article on Sunday). Crazy stories are going around on social media– most unfounded ad only contributing to a climate of fear and a reiteration of the panic in Paris on Friday night. The French government has had to debunkle so many rumors, it is absolutely crazy. Thankfully, “authentic” media are being much more careful than they were during the Charlie Hebdo attacks only relaying informations that have been confirmed by officials, and listening when told to stop covering a certain scene (for those who are unaware, back in January the police lost about 24 hours when trying to find terrorists because a news channel was following them and reporting the exact location of the team on TV and on the Internet…) So, that’s my first point: the Internet was undeniably useful, but it is so unregulated that literally everything and anything is currently being posted on my Facebook feed. An yes, if I didn’t know not to trust them, I would be scared of all of the informations going around.
Second, I have a real problem with the way the Internet sparked because of the Paris attacks and not with other attacks around the world. This is not at all the fault of individuals — yes, I am more shocked by the attacks in Paris than the ones in Beirut or Nigeria: Paris is my hometown and I ahve never been to Lebanon nor Nigeria. I imagine this is also your case and that of most of the Western world: yes, you are going to be more shocked to hear of an attack in a city you’ve lived in, visited, constantly hear about in Pop culture than with one that you (whether legitimately or not) associate with war and unstability. Yes, that is legitimate and justifiable. But Facebook is a Transnational Company. There are Facebook members in France, in Lebanon and in Nigeria. So why did they prefer to implement a safety check in Paris, a show of support by giving you the ability to change your profile picture to our colors and not in Beirut? Why did the Western media not give front page coverage in order to pay respect to the 45 innocents who lost their lives in Beirut? True, it is up to us to relay or not these informations whether or not we find ourselves to be touched by them or not. So I don’t believe this is the fault of the average Westerner, it’s juste basic human psychology. But, I believe that the media, and companies such as Facebook had the responsibility to cover the Beirut attacks as well… and they didn’t, which I find extremely deceiving. So in the end this is my second point: the Internet was great in giving support to Paris. I am so grateful for all of the messages I received asking if I was okay. But every innocent human life has the same worth, and obviously media on the Internet haven’t really shown that in the past days.

Few counselors. Hour-long wait times. General feelings of neglect. Before this year, USC was a campus without a strong culture of mental health awareness. But things might be changing now.
In the past couple of months, the Undergraduate Student Government has led a campaign to break down the stigma of mental health across multiple fronts, from an initiative to create a fall semester break to plans for exposing freshmen to mental health awareness programs during orientation. USG President Rini Sampath, one of the biggest supporters of this issue, stated that she had been motivated by the many stories of students on the “brink of some very unfortunate things.”
“College is a very difficult place,” Sampath said. “Everyone has [difficulties with] mental health, but there are people who will have mental illness. There is a wide variety and range of what people go through and I think it’s about figuring out how we can help each other out.”
Sampath pointed out how, in an effort to counter these statistics, she and USG Director of Wellness Affairs Christine Hasrouni successfully lobbied for the addition of six new counselors at the Engemann Student Health Center a few months ago.
“We brought [the issue] to President Nikias, we brought it to Student Affairs, and we said that students are unable to go see counselors because there is a seven-week wait,” Sampath said. “We should be acting proactively instead of reactively to these problems.”
Sampath mentioned that one of USG’s current actions is implementing a survey to identify students’ main health concerns.
Despite these initiatives, Sampath argued that USG’s main tool in terms of advocacy is passing resolutions, but that ultimately the administration has to implement these policies.
“It’s us laying the foundation, but it’s up to the administration if they want to construct the building,” Sampath said. “We’ve had some successes, like our drop deadline [and] Leavey Library renovations, but overall we are looking for support in other topics that might be harder to talk about, like mental health.”
Javanne Golob, a staff social worker at the counseling center, said that despite the short amount of time since USG began its initiative, some positive results are already visible.
“[USG mental health promotion] is just beginning now,” Golob said. “But I’ve had clients of mine mention that they’ve seen the events or it’s made mental health more a conversation topic on campus, so hopefully it’s starting the conversation and reducing the stigma.”
Golob said USG and other student assemblies are succeeding in popularizing the topic of mental health, making it more “campuswide” and not just something “sequestered in the corner” at the Engemann Center. Golob argued that student organizations have the advantage of going beyond the services available at the Engemann Center, and exploring mental health solutions apart from counseling. She also pointed out how USG is promoting self care habits, such as exercise, eating well, connecting socially, sleeping and seeking peer-to-peer support, which can help prevent individual crises.
“[The Engemann Center’s Interim Assistant Director of Outreach Services  Dr. Kelly Greco and I] work with USG and a lot of the great student groups to formulate events for the  next coming months so that people can notice the signs of a mental health issue coming up before it turns into a crisis,” Golob said. “So we’re trying. We are a little engine.”
On the programming side, this October and November USG’s  Academic Culture Assembly has come to the forefront with its 2015 Mental Health Awareness Month, also known as “Behind the Mask.” Running from Oct. 12 to Nov. 20, Behind the Mask consists of 20 events, many of which are in collaboration with other student assemblies, such as the Black Student Assembly and the Women’s Student Assembly. The events are varied, taking the form of film screenings, student panels, exhibits, karaoke, yoga and even a puppy petting session.
Gisella Tan, executive director of the International Student Assembly and one of the month’s organizers, explained that de-stressing workshops are valuable in removing the “stigma” in some cultures that might have different approaches to mental health. She explained that the defunding of certain centers does not help their cause.
“I don’t think I can speak for all international students, but our resource center, the Office of International Services, has been severely defunded,” Tan said. “So if you need counseling services, you may have to wait a couple of days. And the counseling services that they offer have been greatly minimized.”
But Tan also stated that events such as the de-stressing workshop are not truly effective in generating immediate results.
“[These types of events] are more on the symbolic side,” Tan said. “I don’t think that an hour-long event or even a 20 minute yoga would actually help students successfully to de-stress.”
She added that these events are more of an opportunity to raise awareness by letting students know about the health services available and fostering self-care.
Krystal Chavez, who works in cultural affairs for the Latina/o Student Assembly, also holds awareness to be one of the main goals of Behind the Mask.
“What most people don’t realize is that programming events are essentially advocating for things. Without a goal in mind, the event won’t happen,” Chavez said. “We were advocating to the idea that the administration wasn’t doing what they needed to do in helping students.”
This advocacy has had positive results on some students. After one discussion, Eesen Sivapalan, a junior majoring in business administration and accounting who attended the event,  praised USG’s efforts.
“Not just for the Latino community, but for any minority community on campus, events like these really open up discussion for topics which we wouldn’t normally discuss at home and even amongst our group of friends,” Sivapalan said. “I feel that when it comes to minority groups, things like mental health are topics that are considered taboo in the family, and so because of that, it’s not uncommon for there to be more minority members suffering from mental health issues.”
Sivapalan held that progress was definitely being made in raising awareness, and that later generations would have even easier access to the mental health conversation due to a “shrinking” cultural gap.
And due to the lack of promotion for health services, Sivapalan said that he is “happy” that USG is helping the student body in ways the administration does not.
“The University can do a better job in helping promote the mental health of students,” Sivapalan said. “We have a wait time of seven weeks for us to get an appointment with the counselor, and I feel that that just isn’t fair when we’re paying so much money for tuition.”
In fact, Sivapalan mentioned that without USG’s wellness promotion, his opinion on mental health services would have been different.
“One student pointed out that you can only get to know what’s going on in your mind when you have a facilitator guide you through your own thought process,” Sivapalan said. “The reason why I want to have an appointment with the counselors is only because of this event and the comments in the discussion here. I think events such as these are an essential part of our student experience.”
Now, USG’s biggest concern is what members characterize as an unspoken administrative indifference. Students active in combatting this issue know that their efforts pale against those the University could take.
Sampath, for example, explained that USC and USG have made huge strides in terms of mental health awareness in comparison to other campuses. However, she also said that USG at best can raise awareness, create dialogue and start conversations, but it cannot dictate policy.
“What we can do as Undergraduate Student Government is be the voice for the students and say, ‘This needs to be taken care of,’” Sampath said. “Because, otherwise, what’s going to happen? This is just going to get brushed under the rug.”
—Can USG combat USC’s mental health stigma?
Only by filing a civil rights suit to end it, just as one would do with any other civil rights violation, racism for example.

Moving in one direction, together • From left to right: Associate Managing Editor Emma Peplow, Editor-in-Chief Isabella Sayyah, Features Editor Matt Lemas, Associate Managing Editor Burke Gibson, and Managing Editor Yasmeen Serhan. Emma Peplow | Daily Trojan
As the cliché goes, if you love what you do, you won’t work a day in your life.
I’m not sure who to credit this grand cliché to, but I’m going on record to state that whoever they are, they are unabashedly lying to your face. Nothing quite parallels my deep, profound and — according to my parents and friends that guffaw at all of our work schedules — sometimes irrational love for the Daily Trojan. And yet, every day at 5 p.m., I walk into the newsroom and I go to work.
As an associate managing editor, I edit pages, review stories and oversee sections, but it’s so much more than that. It’s hard, demanding work to stay on top of coverage, to fact check, to make things as perfect as possible in an imperfect and rapidly changing news cycle. That being said, however, it’s the most rewarding work I’ve ever done. I get to hold what we accomplish everyday in the newsroom in my hands the next day. How many people can say that? Given the dwindling life of newspapers and print journalism, I can safely say very few. 
I remember my first day as an editor at the Daily Trojan. It was 11 p.m. on the first day of the spring semester of my freshman year and my computer — that I had laid out all the news pages for the following day on after many hours of toiling over InDesign — crashed. All of my work was deleted, and I had to start the pages over completely. I switched computers and began re-laying out as my tears silently spilled onto the keyboard. Great, I thought. It’s my first day, and I’m already going to be known as the office crier.
As I walked out of the newsroom that night, in the wee hours of the morning I told myself I would finish out the week and then quit. 
“That’s it,” I told my sister on the phone the next day. “It’s too hard, I’m not cut out for it, the editor-in-chief made a mistake in hiring me. I’m not ready.”
I ended up finishing out the week and then the semester, and now here I am almost a year away from the day I was hired as news editor, writing about life as an associate managing editor.
Whether I ever shook the reputation of “the girl that cried on her first day” is debatable, but I am grateful everyday that I didn’t quit. The Daily Trojan is a little like the famous Hotel California alluded to by the Eagles — “You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.”
The Daily Trojan is more than just the place I spend around 40 hours a week at — it’s a way of life. We make up our own imperfect little family in the newsroom, and it is incredibly moving to work with people that challenge and inspire me everyday.
Similar to how Simon Cowell made the historic decision to group together five young male solo artists who had auditioned for the X Factor back in 2010 and had all somehow melded into the greatest boy band (dare I say, band?) of all time, the Daily Trojan editorial board comes together every semester as strangers and somehow, someway magic happens.
We become a family every semester and that is why, though many of the more musically cultivated editors will fight me on this, I believe we are the One Direction of student publications. Separately, each of us editors is talented in our own right, but without each other we couldn’t have won awards, created the quality content we have, picked up a fan following (or reader base), gotten through X Factor bootcamp (also known as the first week of production each semester) or developed our own unique style.
What many people forget, or never cared enough to know in the first place, is that as individual acts, each member of One Direction was cut from the X Factor. They were only brought back and achieved international stardom, fame, mythic god-like status once they joined together as a group. 
One Direction sums it up best when trying to sum up my feelings about my fellow editors. From their recently released song “History,” I say to you, Daily Trojan editors, “You and me got a whole lot of history, we could be the greatest team the world has ever seen.”  
Emma Peplow is a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. She is also associate managing editor of the Daily Trojan.
