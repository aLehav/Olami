The USC women’s soccer team suffered two close losses on their road swing this weekend, falling to Colorado 2-1 on Friday and Utah 1-0 on Sunday. The results knocked the Women of Troy, who have now lost three straight since their upset of No. 8 Stanford, to 6-9-2 overall and 1-6-1 in the Pac-12.
The squad showed promise and offensive ability in both contests, combining to outshoot their opponents 24 to 18. In what has become a disconcerting theme this season, however, the Women of Troy could not capitalize on their opportunities. USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin believes his team has been subjected to a certain amount of plain old bad luck.
“It’s been happening all year, we’ve had plenty of opportunities that we just haven’t been able to convert,” Khosroshahin said. “I have to believe that at some point the ball is going to start bouncing our way.”
Neither team managed a goal during the first half in Boulder, Colo. on Friday afternoon, though not for lack of trying. USC nearly jumped out to a 1-0 lead just before the close of the half when freshman forward Tanya Samarzich fired a near miss that deflected off the goalpost. It would turn out to be the squad’s best scoring chance of the day.
In the second half, the Buffaloes’ Brie Hooks delivered the game’s first goal directly off of a USC offside penalty. It was one of 22 fouls called on the Women of Troy during the game. Six minutes later, Alyssa Herwatt doubled Colorado’s lead with another transition goal.
USC then began its comeback effort, inspired by junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley. Stanley found defender Marlee Carrillo with a free kick in the 88th minute, and the sophomore knocked in the team’s only goal of the weekend. Carrillo’s third goal in two matches turned out to be too little too late for her team, who simply ran out of time after many offensive chances. The result marked the 12th win of the season for Colorado, who garnered several votes in the last coaches’ poll rankings.
Making matters worse for the Women of Troy was the high altitude of Boulder, which Khosroshahin admitted took a toll on his team.
“We struggled with the altitude a lot, especially early on,” Khosroshahin said. “It obviously wasn’t our best game, but to fight back and give ourselves a chance to win was really impressive.”
The Women of Troy played aggressive soccer on Sunday as well, outshooting a solid Utah team 16-6 in Salt Lake City. Once again, however, the team could not convert on any of their many chances.
In another scoreless first half, Stanley and Utah goalkeeper Lindsay Luke were the standouts, trading impressive saves and keeping clean sheets. Freshman forward Kayla Mills and sophomore midfielder Megan Borman created USC’s best chances in the opening half, but could not score.
The Women of Troy remained on the attack in the second, with good opportunities from Mills and sophomore forward Katie Johnson. Still, Luke didn’t budge in maintaining the scoreless tie.
In the 76th minute, Utah turned the tables and finally got past Stanley for a heartbreaking goal. The Utes’ Allie Wisner scooped up a deflected save and fired a winner into the back of the net. USC had managed a score during the final ten minutes of play in their previous two games, however, and remained upbeat down the stretch.
Senior midfielder Jordan Marada had a few good opportunities, but it was Mills who appeared ready to give USC an equalizer in the final minutes. Luke dashed USC’s hopes once again, however, coming up with an impressive diving save to preserve the win. The victory moved the Utes to 8-3-6, with a 4-2-2 Pac-12 mark.
After nearly a full season’s worth of tough losses, Khosroshahin has now become accustomed to teasing silver linings out of disappointing defeats.
“The Utah coaches approached me after the game, and they felt that we made their team look very average,” Khosroshahin said. “That’s a very good side, and for an opposing coach to say that he felt your team deserved a better result is telling.”
Perhaps even more telling were Khosroshahin’s comments about his players’ handling of such a disappointing season.
“This game can be so cruel at times, and yet so rewarding at others,” he said. “This is a very special group of young women, they are so resilient. I am so proud and confident in them bouncing back.”
The Women of Troy have three games remaining on the slate for 2013, including a two-game home set next weekend. The team will host Oregon at 3 p.m. on Friday before battling Oregon State on Senior Day on Sunday at 11 a.m. A pregame ceremony will honor seniors Autumn Altamirano, Haley Boysen, Mia Bruno, Elizabeth Eddy and Jordan Marada.
The squad will then travel across town for their final game of the year — a rivalry matchup with No. 2 UCLA onNov. 7th. Khosroshahin said this week of practice will be focused on rest and recovery.
“After playing two games at altitude, you have to make sure everyone is recovered and ready to go,” Khosroshahin said. “After that, we’ll go back to work on finishing our scoring chances.”

According to the Dept. of Public Safety, a USC student was found dead in his apartment on Sunday night.
The Marshall School of Business released a statement identifying Thu Yain “Roy” Kyaw as the deceased student on Monday.
At approximately 9:30 p.m. on Oct. 27, DPS and the Los Angeles Police Department responded to a call on the 1300 block of West 29th Street. Kyaw’s roommates were not home at the suspected time of his death.
“Upon arriving, [officers] discovered the male lying down unconscious and not breathing,” LAPD Public Information Officer Rosario Herrera said.
The cause of his death has yet to be determined by the coroner’s office, but officers do not suspect foul play.
A representative at the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office said that an individual was found in a residence on 29th Street in Los Angeles, but his identity has not been confirmed. He said that it could take several weeks to determine a cause of death because the autopsy will likely need to include a toxicology report.
NBC Los Angeles reported that according to the coroner’s office, Kyaw died of “acute alcohol toxicity.” A representative of the coroner’s office told the Daily Trojan, however, that the rumors of alcohol poisoning that have surfaced are unsubstantiated.
Dean James G. Ellis said in the statement that Kyaw was a sophomore from Singapore who was involved in Marshall programs such as last spring’s Learning about International Commerce (LINC) trip to Budapest.
“This loss has hit our community particularly hard, as Roy’s older brother is a senior at Marshall,” Ellis said in the statement.
Ellis urged Marshall students who knew Kyaw to contact Associate Dean Kim West, their advisor or counselors in Student Counseling Services or the Center for Work and Family Life for support.

Close the Row for good!
How about instead of closing the row for good…we add a sixth principle to what it means to be a trojan…faithful, scholarly, ambitious, courageous, skillful, and RESPONSIBLE! However, we need to remember that this was a preliminary report and an official cause of death has not been released.
My condolences to the family and Marshall community
Great, blame the victim
rumors of alcohol poisoning

Bryan Singer might have majored in critical studies, but he’s not just an academic.
The USC alumnus, for whom the School of Cinematic Arts’ Bryan Singer Division of Critical Studies is named, graduated in 1989 and has since gone on to direct films such as The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns and four of the films in the X-Men franchise.
Singer transferred to USC after spending two years at the School of Visual Arts in New York. He decided to attend SCA because of its connections to the film industry and history of successful alumni.
“There were a number of graduates like George Lucas, Robert Zemeckis and people like that that came out of USC who I grew up being enormous fans of,” Singer said. “I knew it was one of the most prestigious film schools in the world and it was in Los Angeles. Having done two years in New York City, I really felt that if I wanted to move into mainstream filmmaking, I would have to start setting my roots in Los Angeles.”
Singer originally intended to study film production, but after being rejected from the program three times, settled on critical studies. Though it wasn’t his original plan, Singer said he values the experience and that the things he learned have helped his career as a director.
“The surprise was that it ended up being the best decision that ever happened to me. Critical studies provided me with this enormous overview of cinema, that I might not have gotten in production or more of a narrow major,” he said.
An overarching view of the film industry and a deep knowledge of cinema history were the most valuable takeaways from the critical studies major, Singer said. He said the technical knowledge needed to be a director can be learned on the job and through experience instead.
Singer also cited his time at USC for helping him make connections and meet like-minded students who would go on to work in different aspects of the film industry. John Ottman, an editor and composer, attended SCA with Singer and the two have since collaborated on many films, including the upcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past.
“You learn far more on the job than you’ll ever learn in school. What serves the person entering into the professional realm most is knowledge,” Singer said. “College is all about an overview and relationships. I always say that the classes and the screening experience is 20 percent of what I got out of USC. The other 80 percent is John Ottman.”

Since graduating, Singer has continued to be a presence at USC. He has returned in the past to speak to students and share his experiences. Recently, he donated $5 million to name the Bryan Singer Division of Critical Studies.
“Dean Elizabeth Daley and I agree that having this particular division named for a film director reminds incoming students that it’s not just a major for future critics or academics, it’s also a major at a division that also prepares students for all aspects of the film industry,” Singer said. “It’s the basic knowledge of cinematic language and history that can contribute to any future career, not just what the name ‘critical studies’ implies.”
Singer hopes that his donation will allow the division to give all cinematic arts students the opportunity to continue to watch the best films and learn from the best professors.
“It’s exciting to be involved in this division because every other major at the School of Cinematic Arts takes courses in critical studies,” he said.

Nearly one year after a shooting on campus on Halloween, the #USChangeMovement is petitioning President C. L. Max Nikias and the university administration to take down the gates that went up last January in an effort to increase campus security.
Barriers · Erected in January 2013, the fencing surrounding the university’s campus has been the subject of controversy. Some students believe the gates symbolically represent barriers between USC and the community. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Leaders of the movement believe the gates create a visible barrier that isolates USC from the South Los Angeles community and also serve to increase incidents of racial profiling.
“USC is a community space,” said Makiah Green, a member of the #USChangeMovement who authored the petition. “Community members who have been living here for years can’t access that space anymore. We are in someone else’s neighborhood. It’s not our neighborhood and to restrict access all of a sudden sends a very harmful and disrespectful message. Our understanding is that if the gates don’t come down within this school year, they probably never will.”
The gates were erected following the shooting last Halloween involving men not affiliated with USC. Green, a first-year master’s student in the professional writing program, said that she was troubled by the haste of administrative action, as the announcement regarding the security measures came just six days after the incident.
“The shooting was an isolated incident and because of the nature of it, that shooting could have happened anywhere and so a lot of people felt like the administration did not consider the long-term implications of the gates,” Green said. “They just did it out of fear and panic.”
Still, Dept. of Public Safety Deputy Chief David Carlisle stressed that gates and other enhanced security measures — which include closing the campus after 9 p.m. and requiring ID checks — were not necessarily a direct result of last year’s shooting.
“We at DPS are always evaluating the security measures that we have in place both on and off campus and looking for ways that we can improve our policies, procedures and technology we use to make this as safe a campus as possible,” Carlisle said. “[The shooting] just escalated that process and President Nikias wanted new measures in place to make sure nothing like that ever happened again.”
Katie Gavin, a junior majoring in music, was concerned that rather than increasing safety on campus, the gates create a barrier between people in the community and students.
Gavin added that the overall gentrification of the area surround USC is harmful to the community. In addition to USC’s Master Plan to renovate University Village, private business have also built new apartment complexes such as University Gateway and Icon Plaza. Gavin said such development causes displacement of local residents.
“USC has the potential to be — and has been — a really beneficial place for members of the community because it provides resources and there is a safe environment around here,” Gavin said. “The ideal situation is families can grow up around here, send their kids to charter schools and be able to use the resources on campus freely before or after 9 p.m., but if the plan is to continue to develop the area around here, it means USC is not interested in the family members that aren’t paying USC tuition.”
Naomi McPherson, a junior majoring in American studies and ethnicity and narrative studies, was concerned about increased racial profiling by DPS and private security officials. She said that after the shooting last Halloween, which took place at a Black Student Association event, there was an increase in racially charged conversation and negative perceptions of black students.
“I think students, if they’ve been paying attention, have noticed racial profiling and a lack of attention paid to certain students over others,” McPherson said. “I’ve seen students walk on campus and not show their ID because they were of a certain race and then other people get accosted.”
The “Take Down the USC Gates” petition by the #USChangeMovement currently has more than 290 signatures, but it has yet to garner an administrative response. Every time the petition is signed, however, Nikias and Provost Elizabeth Garrett receive emails.
“We understand the USC administration that is in power will concede nothing they aren’t forced to,” Gavin said. “But, the idea is to gather enough students who care to sign and bring attention to the idea.”
Craig Keys, associate senior vice president for civic engagement, stressed that the gates were created to provide the safety of students and community members.
“It’s not safe for the university to ignore concerns that are expressed and evident by the events that we’ve seen taking place in recent years and months on and around campus. So, for those reasons, we’ve increasingly made safety a priority and re-evaluated the resources that we committed to safety,” Keys said.
Keys said the administration has made presentations to local councils and spoken with various block clubs and residents because they want to hear from the community and improve responsiveness.
“I think it’s important in all of this to recognize that the university is making very significant efforts to balance the safety concerns with our commitment to maintaining an open campus,” he said.
Green said even if the administration does not respond to the petition, she hopes it will spark conversation among students and remind students that the community outside the USC gates is a friendly neighborhood, not a hostile one.
“I want the voices of the students to be heard and respected,” she said. “I hope it will bring about more collaboration between students, community members and senior administration.”
 
Correction: An Oct. 29 article “Students petition to remove fence” quoted Katie Gavin as saying “We understand the USC administration that is in power will concede nothing. They aren’t forced to, but the idea is to gather enough students who care to sign and bring attention to the issue.” The quote should have read, “We understand the USC administration that is in power will concede nothing they aren’t forced to. But, the idea is to gather enough students who care to sign and bring attention to the idea.” The article has been edited to reflect this change.

Actually, when I went to Columbia (at a time when crime rates in New York were much higher), there were pathways which were open and public at all times. The entry control was exercised at the building level, which makes a lot of sense. Students could feel secure in their dorms and buildings without the campus feeling like an armed fortress. It’s a little hard for a university to simultaneously claim to be a great community resource and wall itself off from the community.
I spent some time working with Ms. Green (on unpolitical things) and got to know her rather well in 2010-2011. She is fairly intelligent, but her views lack maturity. Her framework for deconstructing problems suffers from inherent flaws, and her presumption in all our dealings that I supported her views was continually unwelcome. She genuinely believes what she says, and that is the saddest part. Perhaps someday she will outgrow her childish yearnings and find a productive place in society.
Also, she’s definitely a super-senior, not a senior. I guess she must have been too busy protesting to spend time in class.
One more thing–a little birdie told me that she’s working on an article about “these darn gates” and that she’s soliciting quotes. I wonder how that’s going to turn out.
““USC is a community space,” said Makiah Green, a member of the #USChangeMovement who authored the petition
Um, no Makiah, it is not. USC is private property. You should be ashamed of yourself for not knowing that distinction. Next.
With all due respect to Ms. Makiah Green, USC didn’t just magically appear in “someone else’s neighborhood.” USC has been a presence in the West Adams neighborhood since the late 1800s, whereas the current population demographics in the area began to shift some time in the 1960s and most noticeably in the 1980s. 
I respect the many upstanding, non-USC affiliated local residents of West Adams; many of them were my neighbors when I was an undergraduate at the University between 2006-2010 —but it is completely disingenuous to suggest that, just because USC is perceived to have the upper hand in the privileged department when compared to the local residents, that USC should bend to the will of people who have no investment or ties to the University.
I’m sure Ms. Green’s intentions are good, but she should really educate herself on the history of the area before she makes broad statements about who does or doesn’t have “rights” to control private space in an area — let alone suggest that USC is some kind of intruder to West Adams.
USC’s campus is not public property. It’s not a place for the local denizens to meander through. Enough of the PC culture that USC is trying to immerse itself in. USC does more than enough when it comes to reaching out to the black and brown community i.e. 90007 via JEP and other programs. USC is not a elitist WASPy school that snubs those who aren’t wealthy and white. Enough of the apologetic mentality. The local denizens are NOT entitled to USC’s campus unless they got legit business.
It is a great comfort to we parents who are paying full freight to send our kids to USC to feel like they are safer. This is a private, expensive institution. My student volunteers in the neighborhood schools near USC, the money she spends in the local businesses raises tax dollars to help the community. There are many public events USC makes available. That is plenty!
Students need to be safe. All urban campuses have risks, and the benefits of living near a city outweigh them certainly. Yet USC is in fact located in a very low income, high crime community. Many students from our area will not apply to USC because of the bad neighborhood. That is a fact. The reputation and future of the university depends upon the families who pay tuition to feel like their money is well spent. The value of your diploma at USC depends upon public perception of its value. If it is seen as a dangerous place to attend, that may erode the credibility of your degree.
I agree with those who call for a more permanent, beautiful gate around the campus. It would send a message that the university understands the risks of the location, and is doing all it can. Let the gates stand!
PLEASE DO NOT TAKE DOWN GATE!
I signed the petition to start a second row for the lower tier sororities at the beginning of the semester.  Like many other student petitions, USC apparently ignored it
Ms. Green, your facts are wrong, your reasoning is seriously flawed. I suggest you rewrite your petition with some semblance of truth if you want anyone to take you seriously.
Alright everyone… PLEASE listen to me very carefully as it is very important to understand how misguided and uninformed some people are (particularly Makiah Green) about the University’s place in the community:
USC is NOT in someone else’s community as Green suggests.  This is one of the greatest misconceptions I hear.  The point of fact is that “University Park” is very much USC’s neighborhood, and community members who live near USC are living in USC’s neighborhood.  This is critical to understand.  USC was founded in the late 1800’s.  USC is in fact a founding member of that neighborhood.  One could rightly argue that those several blocks we now know as “University Park” would barely be on the radar if it were not for USC’s substantial presence there since its founding.  The community was indeed built around the University.
Moreover, any suggestion that USC has been anything but a benefit to the neighborhood at large is a lie.  I am so proud, as a Trojan, to hail from a University that has and continues to poor so much money and resources into the community it shares.  USC has shown great philanthropy and dedication to its neighbors, not least of which was manifest in its decision several years ago to stay put, rather than move to a new location.
I agree that the gates should go.  They are ugly, and serve only to affirm the concerns that many have about the University neighborhood.  I would support a compromise as suggested in another comment, whereby more permanent and decorative gates would be constructed in a less obtrusive style.  However, it is critical that people such as Green understand how profoundly incorrect they are about USC’s place in the community.
Further to my own comment (and as others have suggested)… USC is a private institution, and as such has no mandate to enroll, engage or host anyone.  USC is NOT a public community space.  This is yet another amazing misconception.  Public universities like UCLA, by comparison, do indeed have a mandate to serve the public, and evidence of its extra-educational function can be seen throughout its campus, buildings and facilites.  
Ignorant comments and misunderstanding like those offered by Makiah Green should not be coming from educated college students; I’m truly bewildered.
Mr. Author, I am sorry, but this is indeed our neighborhood, just as much as it is everyone else’ who lives in proximity. You sorely misunderstand the relationship between USC and the City. You act as though USC is public property. It is not. It is private and the non USC community has never had unfettered access to all of its resources. That would be unfair to the people who pay $70k a year to put their kids through school here, along with paying extra for obvious scholarship students such as yourself who think USC should be a Free ride. I assure you, it is  not. I work hard to put my kids through this school. I pay taxes to help the local community. USC is not the responsible party here. Take your welfare society and start paying your own way and you will have a better understanding of what it means be a serving member of the neighborhood, which USC has proudly been for over 125 years.
USC is one of the most open and diverse universities in the nation. But, attending it is a privilege not a right. It’s resources are a privilege not a right. We have the right to lock our doors at night.
A contrary opinion:
https://www.change.org/petitions/c-l-max-nikias-do-not-take-down-the-usc-gates
USC has always been involved in the community, and we rightfully take pride in partnering with numerous community organizations so that we are good neighbors and an asset to our community. That being said, the campus is still private property. There is no need for anyone not affiliated with the University to be on campus between 9 pm and 6 am.
Just as important as it is to be active members of this community, USC has an obligation to keep its students safe on campus. Of course profiling is an issue, but there are much more effective and reasonable means to address that issue.
Keep the gates
The larger, unsaid issue is that the gates are an eyesore. 
Other urban universities (Columbia, Penn, Yale) have similar, strict access control at night, but don’t look as prison-like about it since their perimeters were designed with access control in mind. USC with its large plazas book-ending Trousdale was not. 
If those plazas could somehow be reconfigured and perhaps beautified with permanent, landmark gates (e.g. Sather Gate at Berkeley, Straus Gate at Harvard, any of Columbia’s wonderful gates, etc.) that would be the best of both worlds. I suggest Google-imaging these to see how collegiate gates, when done correctly, can be beautiful. 
As it stands, the temporary fencing USC is using makes it look like a penitentiary and comes off as cold and unwelcome even to those who have access.
You are absolutely correct about this.  The temporary gates look horrible, and make the University look anything but a distinguished private campus.  The examples cited of gates on other campuses are exactly what’s needed… if indeed we need gates at all.
+1. A beautiful wall made of brick and mortar would be an ideal replacement for that rough-edged, “junkyard,” and tacky fence. I feel like pitbulls are going to run up to me and bark. Ghetto. Besides, these proposed walls can grow ivies…and you know what that means? SC = Ivy
NO Miss Green, the neighborhood around USC is unfortunately NOT a friendly one, otherwise we wouldn’t need patrols on every corner and we wouldn’t have to be afraid to be mugged or accosted every time we walk down the street. Incidents happen on almost a weekly basis. I have no idea where you live and where your ignorance comes from but the neighborhood around USC is a very dangerous one, especially at night. Sadly, all the gang members in that community do not care about others, as such they are ruining the neighborhood for everyone else, however that is not USC’s issue to fix! That is an issue the community needs to address and fix. Perhaps Miss Green, you can get involved and straighten out the gang members and druggies and help that community because an upstanding community instead of an outcast that it currently is. This is where you should put your energy Miss Green. This is were you can make the difference! HELP THAT COMMUNITY!
USC is certainly NOT a community space and to make such a claim is complete nonsense!  USC is a PRIVATE university, and as such has every right to restrict admission to its premises at anytime to anyone, who has no business being there. USC has a responsibility to its students, staff and faculty to keep them safe, especially at night. The community members have no business on campus especially at night. USC is in the middle of the ghetto and MUST do all it possible can to protect itself. Other private universities such as USD in SD do the exact same thing. Please do NOT take down those gates, they are needed for the safety of our students and if people can’t understand this, they have no business being there to begin with!
I have worked for USC for 12 years and I can safetly say that thanks to the gates during night hours the campus is the safest and most secure I have ever seen.  PLEASE PLEASE do not take down the gates!!!!!!!!!!!
USC is not a community space.  It is private property.  Those who pay to be there have access to it 24 hours a day.  Those who don’t, don’t.  It’s quite simple and there’s nothing racial about it.
Do you also have a problem with other private establishments–restaurants, grocery stores, movie theaters, etc.–having hours during which they are not open to the public?
Also, USC has been here since 1880… why exactly isn’t this “our neighborhood”?

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted Joseph Turow, a professor from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, for a talk on technology and retail stores on Monday afternoon.
Technological takeover · University of Pennsylvania professor Joseph Turow spoke about how in-store media has affected sales and revenues on Monday. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
Turow said there will be another wave of technology within the next decade that will make shopping at malls and grocery stores a more personalized experience for each user.
Turow discussed how appliances in stores that market messages to shoppers function as media. He gave the examples of coupon papers on the shelves of the grocery store and the televisions found on the ceiling of the local movie rental store that play trailers of movies, both in hopes of gaining the clients’ attention and influencing to make a purchase.
Turow said 40 percent of Facebook revenues now comes from mobile use, nine in 10 American adults now have a cell phone and 57 percent of adults own smartphones.
“Clearly mobile is an important media,” Turow said. “It is the most persuasive medium in the world. People sleep with their phones. People know their phones are lost more than their credit cards. And marketers really know this.”
Given this information, Turow explained that due to users’ constant consumption of information through mobile devices, many businesses are finding ways to make their retail experience more personalized.
Though in its beginning stages, there is an idea to produce an in-store tracking map of each person walking into a specific store via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Theoretically, Turow said consumers would connect their phones to the retail store, which would start their personalized experience.
Turow gave the example of a grocery store. Every time the person purchases a food item, it will supposedly register as data on that person’s account so that the next time the consumer shops at the grocery store, the marketers will show any coupons for the foods that the consumer has bought before.
Turow located problems within the system’s algorithms that start collecting personal data of each shopper.
He predicted that the collected data would create social hierarchies, which would encourage people to shop for goods at their socioeconomic “level.”
Turow used Neiman Marcus as an example of a store that could look at a consumer’s previous purchases and, using algorithms, judge if that consumer is someone who would be able to shop at Neiman Marcus.
“At that point, someone decided who you are — that is the problem,” said Ellen Helsper, an associate professor in media and communications at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
If this system were put in place, it would run the risk of preventing a person’s perceived identity from changing.
Turow argued that a business should split its square footage in half and use one of the spaces as a place to try clothes on and shop online, in order to transform the shopping experience into an easier system.
Turow said he believes that online shopping is gaining popularity, so a consumer could try on the clothing in the store and then order it online at his or her leisure.
“I can put on a medium coat, and then have it tomorrow,” Turow said of trying something on in a store and ordering it online.
Turow described businesses that are now advancing their in-store media to brand their retail even further, giving consumers a more powerful experience.
“In society, [two things are] really important in retail experience: touch and feel. [The] human experience is even now more important,” Helsper said.
Turow anticipated this transformation within retail shopping to happen in a decade, but says that the execution of the idea is still in the works.
“The programs are transforming the architecture of physical and digital retailing and the relationship between the two, in ways that make the selling environment increasingly dynamic and mutable for the individual prospect,” Turow said. “You are changing the store for the person walking through -— that’s the goal.”

The top-ranked USC women’s golf team took home yet another piece of hardware on Sunday, soundly winning the Stanford Intercollegiate for the second straight year. The event marked the team’s sixth consecutive victory and third straight victory to start the season, both of which extend school records.

It was a historic performance for the Women of Troy, who finished at a remarkable 21-under par over the course of three rounds. This was a record-low performance for the team, as was their second-round score of 272. No. 5 UCLA also put in a strong performance, finishing second at 16-under for the tournament. The Bruins’ second-round total of 268 was remarkable as well, four strokes better than USC. No. 9 Stanford, No. 12 Washington and Pepperdine rounded out the top five in an impressive field, each finishing well behind the Los Angeles schools.
Making the win all the more impressive was the fact that USC head coach Andrea Gaston used her third different starting five of the season. Senior Sophia Popov led the way for the Women of Troy, finishing in sole possession of second place with a score of 6-under. Popov seemed destined for her sixth individual victory, starting the tournament off with a 5-under 66 and a 4-under 67. Unfortunately, a final-round mark of 3-over allowed UCLA’s Alison Lee to rally for the individual win. Still, Popov extended her school record for rounds in the 60s to 19 and tied her career-best overall score.
Finishing just behind Popov in a third place tie were sophomore Annie Park and freshman Karen Chung, who both totaled a 5-under. Park combined for a score of 2-over in her first two rounds before a monster round of 7-under 64 on Sunday, a score nearly good enough to set a school record. That mark still belongs to her teammate, sophomore Kyung Kim, who shot a 63 last season. Park managed an eagle on the par-4 9th hole at Stanford Golf Course before carding three birdies on the back nine.
Chung was more consistent, shooting scores of 2-under, 4-under and 1-over on her way to a top-five finish. Chung now has two top-10 results in her first two matches for USC.
Junior Doris Chen fired an impressive 3-under 68 during the Women of Troy’s record-setting second round, ultimately tying for 13th with an even par score. The junior has now finished in the top 15 in all of this season’s events. Kim rounded out the scoring at 3-over, a comparative struggle considering she had yet to fall outside the top two in any event this fall. Kim’s performance in the tournament was still impressive, with her worst daily score being a 2-over on Sunday.
The Women of Troy conclude their fall season in Kailua Kona, Hawaii with the Pac-12 preview, which begins Nov. 4. The team will look to complete an undefeated fall season before its long winter hiatus, a feat that will be difficult to accomplish considering the other schools in the tournament. Including USC, six teams from the Pac-12 are currently ranked in the top 25. The preview will be an exciting test for some of the country’s best players and teams.

In the days leading up to USC’s Friday night matchup against Oregon State, one thing that will be likely emphasized in nearly every preview written about the game will be how the Trojans have not won a road game against the Beavers since 2004. Corvallis, Ore. has not been kind to USC for the better part of the past decade, with Oregon State beating USC three times — twice when the Trojans were ranked in the top three.
This week’s matchup, though, has one key difference from the previous three — Oregon State is the better team.
In 2006, USC was ranked No. 3 and looking to return to the BCS National Championship game after losing to Texas the year before. Led by first-year starting quarterback John David Booty’s 406-yard passing day, the Trojans outgained the Beavers by more than 140 yards but were done in by four turnovers compared to none for Oregon State. Despite the many blunders, USC had a chance to tie the game with seven seconds left, but failed on a two-point conversion attempt and lost 33-31.
Two years later, Mark Sanchez had the Trojans ranked No. 1 and looking poised to reclaim their throne as national champions, but for all the hype surrounding Sanchez and the USC offense, the Beavers had their own answer — running back Jacquizz Rodgers. Rodgers had 186 rushing yards on an eye-popping 37 carries and gashed the USC defense for tough yardage. Oregon State again won the turnover battle, with USC committing two turnovers compared to the Beavers’ zero.
Then came the 2010 game. By this time, USC’s extended run as one of the nation’s premier programs had reached its end, though the Trojans were ranked No. 20 and had a respectable 7-3 record in former head coach Lane Kiffin’s first season. Oregon State entered the game 4-5 and had little cause for confidence, other than the fact that the game was at home, in beating USC.
Once the game was underway, though, it was clear that there was something in the air in Corvallis. Just as they had in their previous two trips, the Trojans looked out of sorts amid the crowd’s cheers and the cold, crisp air. An Oregon State touchdown on a 65-yard interception return sparked the Reser Stadium crowd, and after quarterback Matt Barkley was knocked out of the game just before halftime, the USC offense was essentially nonexistent. When all was said and done, the Beavers had crushed the Trojans 37-6.
I was at the 2010 game and can attest to this — it was impossible to feel comfortable in that stadium. Oregon State’s campus is surrounded by, well, not much. Open farmland is about all there is to see on the drive in, a far cry from the overwhelming metropolis of Downtown Los Angeles. Corvallis, though, can be overwhelming in its own way. The fans love their team, and with not much else to do on a Saturday night, they come out in full force, especially with a high-profile team like USC coming into town. And though Reser Stadium holds 45,674 fans, less than half of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the layout of the stands makes it sound as though there are many more in attendance.
This year’s game might be different than the most recent showdowns. USC is currently a 5.5-point underdog, whereas the Trojans were favored in each of the previous three meetings. That should remove the possibility that USC overlooks this Friday’s game, something the team appeared to have done judging by its play in the past three games against Oregon State.
In the two most recent Oregon State victories, most of the damage against USC was done on the ground, with the Beavers tallying more rushing than passing yards each game. Current Oregon State quarterback Sean Mannion leads the nation in passing yards this season, meaning we will likely see plenty of passes thrown at a shoddy USC secondary.
But what should give USC hope in what appears to be a hopeless situation heading into Corvallis is the lack of expectations. Top-ranked Trojan teams of the past couldn’t win at Oregon State, so how can this year’s team, injury woes and all, be expected to? Merely keeping the game close would be a vast improvement from 2010’s matchup.
Oregon State has thrived off of beating USC in recent years because USC meant more then on a national scale than it does now. The 2006 team had won 38 regular-season games heading into its tilt with Oregon State, the 2008 team was the top-ranked team in the nation and even the 2010 team was less than two years removed from a Rose Bowl victory.
This is not the case for this year’s team. USC has fallen off the map on a national scale — beating the Trojans does not get people nearly as excited as it once did. But this might play in USC’s favor on Friday night. Interim head coach Ed Orgeron is a masterful motivator, and you can be sure that he will play up this angle to his players, at least privately.
Expectations are nearly nonexistent for this week — the team has no depth, no health and virtually no shot at beating Oregon State for the first time since 2004. But strange things tend to happen when you least expect them — and as Reser Stadium has proven whenever USC comes to play, things tend to deviate from the plan. At least this year, for the Trojans, that could be an ideal scenario.

In the midst of what USC head coach Mick Haley is calling the toughest stretch of the season, the USC women’s volleyball team fell 3-1 (23-25, 25-23, 19-25, 22-24) to the University of Washington on Sunday, losing for the second time in three matches after an 11-match winning streak. USC suffered its first home loss of the season and snapped a 16-match win streak at the Galen Center, with the team’s previous defeat coming in a 3-0 loss to Oregon on Sept. 21, 2012.
Not enough · USC senior outside hitter Sara Shaw posted 14 kills, 14 digs and one ace in the Women of Troy’s 3-1 loss to Washington. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
Haley, who noted the particular importance of serving and passing in games against the Huskies (17-1, 9-1 Pac-12), didn’t hesitate in identifying Washington as the better team.
“They won the serving and passing war,” Haley said. “They served better and tougher. Our offense was okay. We still had enough kills to win. It was our inability to keep them off the net to help our defense.”
Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio led USC (18-3, 8-2) with 16 kills, but hit just .222 and committed eight errors. Senior outside hitter Sara Shaw recorded a season-high 14 kills, and senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard also hit double digits with 12. The USC defense, however, failed to contain the Washington attack, as outside hitter Krista Vansant notched a backbreaking 22 kills.
“We didn’t have enough fight, and I think we would have been able to outlast Washington if we pushed them to a fifth set,” senior libero Natalie Hagglund said. “Like I said last week, we need to do the little things right, like passing and proper setting. We need to focus on playing good volleyball and dominating the basic skills.”
Both teams played a hotly contested first set, and USC appeared to be pulling away after going up 20-16 on an Olgard kill. But the Huskies stormed back and tied the game 23-all before a kill and USC error sealed the first set for the visitors 25-23.
After dropping the opening set for just the third time all season, the Women of Troy recovered in the second. USC turned a 19-17 deficit into a 20-19 lead with a three-point run punctuated by Bricio’s sole ace of the match. Shaw brought up set point with a kill, after which Olgard knocked down a kill to conclude the frame 25-23.
The Women of Troy failed to sustain any momentum coming out of the break, however, as Washington posted leads of 11-6 and then 16-9 in the third set. USC never came within less than five points of the lead after that, and Washington ended it on a Vansant kill to go up 2-1.
USC looked determined to send the match to a tiebreaker as they stormed ahead 10-4 on a Shaw ace and Olgard kill. The Huskies, however, stunned everyone in the building with 10 consecutive points and went up 14-10. A Bricio kill later put USC behind 20-21, but Washington ended any hopes of a comeback and clinched the match on another kill from Vansant to give USC its third loss of the season.
“It was a strange match because we should have won the first set and they should have won the second set. Neither happened,” Haley said. “We made seven errors between points 17 and 25, and that’s how we lost [the first set]. We didn’t come out with any intensity for the third set, and that’s a big problem for us.”
The Women of Troy will have little time to dwell on the loss, as they head north to take on Stanford on Wednesday and California on Friday. As Haley noted, this stretch is especially tough for the players who are as focused on academics as the game itself.
“If we don’t learn from this, we could lose three in a row here,” Haley said. “We won’t have any chance to practice for Stanford or Cal because we need to recover. I have to give them time to study and recover as well. As much as they hate losing and as much as I hate losing, it’s an opportunity to look at our errors. We gave Washington so many unforced errors in that match.”
Wednesday’s match against Stanford is set to begin at 7:30 p.m. and will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.

USC faces a new challenge this week as it travels to Corvallis, Ore. to take on Oregon State in its third Friday night game since 1999.
Throwing it out there · Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler will have to work with a limited group of options, as many of his top tight ends and receivers are not expected to play against Oregon State. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Beavers (6-2, 4-1 Pac-12) just dropped out of the top 25 after a 20-12 loss to then-No. 6 Stanford, but boast the No. 1 passing offense in the country behind junior quarterback Sean Mannion.
Quarterback comparison
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler is coming off one of his best performances of the year with 230 yards, one touchdown and no turnovers against Utah. But Kessler has yet to put up numbers anywhere close to Mannion’s.
Mannion leads the nation with 407.9 yards per game, with 30 touchdowns and only 3 interceptions.
Conditions in Corvallis
Much has been made of the hostile atmosphere of Oregon State’s Reser Stadium. Last time USC traveled to Corvallis in what ended up being the most recent of three straight losses at Oregon State, the Trojans fell 36-7 after backup Mitch Mustain replaced an injured Matt Barkley.
Though the players insist they’re not focusing on the recent record against the Beavers, the team is doing everything it can to prepare for the atmosphere, especially considering the result of its last away game: a 14-10 loss at Notre Dame.
“We’re gonna address some of the mistakes on the road against Notre Dame,” interim head coach Ed Orgeron said. “Maybe the crowd affected us. Maybe it didn’t. But I’m gonna do a better job as head coach of simulating some of that in practice.”
Orgeron was true to his word, as chainsaw noises rung from the speakers at Monday’s practice, mimicking Oregon State’s common celebratory sound.
Some of the Trojans who have never traveled to Corvallis before have been greatly anticipating this game.
“I’ve heard a lot of things [about playing at Reser Stadium]: Loud. Crazy,” redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble said. “But that’s what I came to college football to do is play in those type of environments … That’s what makes the game fun for me.”
Stepping up
Against Utah, several Trojans were forced to replace the bevy of injured first-team players.
Junior defensive end J.R. Tavai filled in admirably for the injured senior linebacker Morgan Breslin, leading the team with six tackles and two sacks. Tavai will need to step up again this Friday, as Orgeron announced at Monday’s practice that Breslin would be out again this week with a hip injury.
Also out for the Trojans this Friday are redshirt junior cornerback Anthony Brown and redshirt junior tight end Randall Telfer.
Injuries at the tight end and wide receiver positions have allowed a number of new Trojans to make catches in the past few weeks.
Against the Utes, redshirt senior wide receiver De’Von Flournoy hauled in a 31-yard pass, the longest of his career. Entering his season, Flournoy only had one catch as a Trojan, so he has greatly appreciated his recent success.
“It’s the greatest feeling in the world,” Flournoy said. “You have your parents in the stands and you actually get on the field and make plays for your team. It’s a great feeling.”
With both Grimble and Telfer out against Utah, sophomore tight end Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick and redshirt junior Chris Willson, who switched from quarterback to tight end, were forced to make some big plays. Though Orgeron listed Grimble as questionable, Grimble said he expects to play on Friday. Cope-Fitzpatrick was also injured against Utah and is questionable for the Oregon State game, but Grimble promised the tight ends will not disappoint.
“We have one big tight end family and we’ve got a lot of talented guys in the room,” Grimble said.
Other players Orgeron listed as questionable include freshman safety Su’a Cravens (groin), redshirt senior offensive lineman Kevin Graf (ankle) and junior wide receiver Marqise Lee (knee).

Growing up, just about everything I did revolved around stickers.
If I did well on a homework assignment at school, I’d get a sticker. If I played through a piano piece with no mistakes, I’d get a sticker. If my parents thought I was behaving well, they’d take me to the sticker store … and I’d get a sticker.
This fascination with stickers eventually wore off. I didn’t care much for the sticker residue that would never come off or how easily stickers would crumple up in my pockets or my hand.
But I’ve started to appreciate stickers again in the new digital format they’ve taken on. Messaging apps are making their content more immersive, and stickers, which are larger and more detailed emoticons and emojis, are stealing the show.
Line, a Japanese mobile messaging company, has an eponymous app that belongs to the same messaging niche as KakaoTalk, WhatsApp and WeChat. It’s very similar to all of these other apps, except for one important feature — its stickers.
Only two years old, Line has been hitting exceptional milestones. The company has 230 million registered users, with more than 47 million of those coming from Japan. From its games and the messaging app alone, Line has made $132 million in revenue.
But here’s where the role of its stickers come in: Line makes more than $10 million per month just from the sale of its sticker packs. Yes, stickers.
What exactly makes these stickers stand out from those of its competitor apps? For one, they express a wider range of emotions than the emoticons on, say, your native iOS messaging app. Need a sticker that will convey just how deliriously angry you are? How about a sticker to show how hungry you are? Line has it all, as expressed through stickers of characters turning red with emotion and ravenously tearing into fried chicken.
There’s more wiggle room for customization as well. No, you can’t make your own stickers (though this might be Line’s next project), but there are certainly a number of packs to choose from such as Hello Kitty, Monsters University, Iron Man 3 and more.
Line, however, isn’t dependent on other brands for its source of stickers. The messaging company has its own set of characters from “LINE TOWN” that include Cony the rabbit, Brown the bear and Moon the human. But Line, as mentioned before, also has its share of sponsored stickers, and other messaging platforms are trying to catch up.
A few months after Facebook debuted its stickers for Facebook Home, stickers for Despicable Me were added to the sticker store, which were rumored to be sponsored. Check the Facebook sticker store these days, and you’ll find that there are stickers for Cut the Rope and Candy Crush — two popular mobile games that are likely sponsored, since stickers can also be used on mobile Facebook messagings.
Stickers also give artists a chance to show off their talents to a wide audience. Every preview of a sticker pack lists the artist that designed the character, so these names get recognition and possibly some work. Path, a timeline-inspired social networking app, for instance, offers many beautifully illustrated stickers by independent artists. Even Facebook’s former sticker designer Sophie Xie ended up striking out on her own to design Dolo, a geolocation app that helps people find each other in San Francisco’s Dolores Park.
Yet, despite the number of platforms that have adopted stickers, Line still reigns in revenue from stickers, and there are a number of reasons that can be attributed to this lead.
Line targets a special and profitable audience. As of September, Japan officially spends more money than Americans on their iPhone and Android apps. Another example of this spending is Puzzle & Dragons, a popular strategy game app that climbed the app charts over the summer and generates $3.75 million a day, mostly from Japanese gamers.
Besides its messaging app, Line also offers a number of games such as LINE POP, a cuter and furrier version of Candy Crush, as well as LINE PLAY, an interactive and customizable Sims-like game, that tie in the main characters they use in their stickers as well. In short, Line has strong brand uniformity.
Even big names such as tennis superstar Rafael Nadal and, as of late, Sir Paul McCartney, are jumping on the Line bandwagon, helping boost the reputation of this messaging app.
On the other hand, not everyone has been pleased with the virality of these stickers and Line. In fact, in May, Apple decided to ban the option on Line to send stickers as gifts to friends. Considering that Apple receives a chunk of these profits, it seemed strange that Apple would put a halt on sending sticker gifts. But since younger children also use this app, it’s a possibility that these kids were exchanging and purchasing stickers for each other. After all, who could resist the charm of a winking Hello Kitty sticker?
Just from stickers, Line has made quite a business for itself. It sounds silly, but the company has been able to keep the momentum going. Is Line making enough money to go public? Possibly, especially since Line can definitely look to expand to other international markets. But is it realistic enough for Line to go public? Give it a couple more years, and see if Line is as strong as it was during its peak.
We’ve come along way from “:)” to full-blown illustrations, but there’s still more room to grow. Stickers as GIFs will most likely be next, as will GIFs and stickers with sound. With so many options and possibilities, keep your eyes peeled: These evolved emoticons are sure to “stick” around.

As the temperatures begin to drop, Kelly Clarkson’s first Christmas album, Wrapped in Red, might bring a little warmth and pre-holiday cheer when it debuts Tuesday.
Back for the holidays · Kelly Clarkson’s Wrapped in Red is the Texas-based songstress’ first studio album since 2011’s Stronger. – Photo courtesy of RCA Records
Though this is Clarkson’s first Christmas album, it’s not her first foray into the genre. Her rendition of “My Grown-up Christmas List,” which she sang on American Idol, has since become a holiday staple. Wrapped in Red allows Clarkson to use her expressive vocals and style, while also giving the songs a Santa-approved trademark.
Though this is Clarkson’s sixth studio album, the singer shows she still has a couple of tricks up her sleeve, in this case five original Christmas songs. True, Clarkson has been co-writing songs since her debut album in 2003. It’s no easy feat, however, to pen new holiday classics. By grounding her album with feelings she’s experienced in her relationships, though, she’s managed to create new songs sure to be played during the holiday season for years to come.
The title and opening track, “Wrapped in Red,” one of the songs co-written by Clarkson, is inspired by the infamous card confession scene with Keira Knightley in Love Actually. In the song, Clarkson recalls experiences of holiday romance, the fun bits and moments of melancholy.
Clarkson gives the album a country twist in her cover of the popular country song and Elvis Presley original, “Blue Christmas.” The pop country singer proves that she can do mellow as confidently as soul-splitting vocals in it. Needless to say, she does Elvis proud.
Another country-infused song on the album is “Baby, it’s Cold Outside,” done in collaboration with Ronnie Dunn, an American country singer. The song is not exactly lacking in anything. With so many renditions of the song out there, however, this version might lack a little bit of the sexiness or chemistry needed to differentiate it from the pack.
Clarkson’s cover of Judy Garland’s “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” introduces a slower and more bittersweet feel to the album. In contrast to many other covers, such as Ella Fitzgerald’s jazzy version or Michael Bublé’s warming croon, Clarkson returns the song to its melancholy roots.
Clarkson made another unexpected choice to cover Imogen Heap’s “Just for Now,” justified by the line, “It’s that time of the year / Leave our hopelessness aside.” Originally a ballad about heartbreak, it doesn’t sound very Christmas-y, but the song is well performed and fits in Clarkson’s repertoire. Perhaps after this album, the song might just be infused with a new meaning. Or maybe not. “Just for Now” is a wonderful song on its own, but even Clarkson’s stellar performance doesn’t give it enough of a Christmas feel.
One of the album’s highlights is undoubtedly “Underneath the Tree,” one of the songs co-written by Clarkson. Many have compared both “Underneath the Tree” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas,” one of Carey’s biggest hits. Like Carey, Clarkson eschewed the material parts of Christmas in exchange for the emotion underlying it. The song is catchy and contemporary but offers a variety of influences dating back to early Christmas classics. Lines such as, “Presents, what a beautiful sight / Don’t mean a thing if you ain’t holding me tight / You’re all that I need / Underneath the tree,” reflect the pleasing blend of traditional and modern, which runs through the album to create a feeling of timelessness.
Clarkson ends with “Silent Night” and “I’ll be Home for Christmas.” “Silent Night” is a team effort with Reba McEntire and Trisha Yearwood. Some versions of the album also features a stanza of the ecclesiastical hymn “Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel” that seems a little out of place with the tone of the album. The decidedly secular and holiday romance-oriented themes of the album, which are exemplified in Clarkson’s originals, are worlds away, and the hymn seems a little dated in comparison.
Clarkson’s album is pleasant, upbeat and undoubtedly well sung, with songs that showcase her strengths. The vast array of stylistic influences on the album from country to pop to musical theater celebrate the universality and accessibility of Christmas music throughout music genres. Even though a few songs might feel out of place, as a whole the album is worth a listen. The original songs might be a little fluffy but they’re still enjoyable. Clarkson and producer Greg Kurstin, who also produced her previous album Stronger, seems to have found a winning combination. After all, isn’t everything better wrapped in red underneath a Christmas tree?

Imogen Heap’s ‘Just For Now’ has always been a Christmas song, if not in the usual sense.  It was originally written for a Christmas episode of The OC, but for some reason not used.  All of the lyrics make sense as a description of a typical family Christmas.

At a school where networking is a priority, Richelle Gribble addresses the concept of various networks in her upcoming solo exhibition CONNECTED at the Helen Lindhurst Gallery at Watt Hall that opened Monday and runs through Nov. 7.
It’s all relative · One of Gribble’s largest works is “Networked Life: 365,” a mixed-media art piece that incorporates images of different networks. The images will be mounted on movable tiles and then presented as a mosaic-like puzzle where users can interact with the work by sliding the tiles. – Photo courtesy of Richelle Gribble
Gribble is no stranger to the art world. As a senior fine arts major in the Roski School of Fine Arts, she has already had two exhibits at USC: Parts per Million and Neuron to Networked Society. This past year at the TEDxTrousdale event, she gave a presentation about art in relation to our role in a networked society.
The idea for Gribble’s upcoming exhibition, CONNECTED, began in her freshman year at USC. Originally from the small town of Idyllwild, Calif. in the San Jacinto Mountains, Gribble said moving to Los Angeles was a huge change. She immediately responded by making art about groupings in relation to various objects and people found in Los Angeles. This idea manifested in different ways through her years at USC, finally taking shape as a comprehensive exhibit that encapsulates her diverse interests in fields such as neuroscience, biology, anthropology and human networking.
In CONNECTED, attendees will witness and become a part of these frameworks of connection, large and small.
One of her most recent projects, “Networked Life: 365,” is the largest piece in the exhibition. This piece is a compilation of 365 different 6-inch by 6-inch squares made each day of the year, beginning Oct. 3, 2012 and ending Oct. 3, 2013.
“Each day, I made an image that related to an experience, event, idea, word or image of a network that correlated to my daily experience,” Gribble said.
Gribble used her own Facebook page to promote her artwork every day of the “Networked Life: 365” project.
“My Facebook followers sent me content (ideas, articles, images or words) that related to networks so they could influence my artwork for that daily post,” Gribble said. She tracked participation and interactions on social media such as liking or sharing a post on Facebook.
“I tracked the interactions of each image as well as received viewer participation online. This process served as a way for me to interact with the Internet, one of the largest networks today, and my own social network to elaborate and enrich ideas of network systems,” Gribble said.
Her Facebook network played a large part in her networks of art. Yet, the networks do not cease once the exhibit is put up.
During the exhibition, attendees will be able to become a part of the artwork. Those who walk through the gallery can move around the pieces of “Networked Life: 365” — each square is framed by Plexiglass and attached to the wall by Velcro. Additionally, the gallery will have three computers on which attendees can build their own connections of these squares electronically, screenshot the artwork and compare connections to different users.
“Everything is tracked in such a way that infinite relationships between separate components start to collide into one body, one form,” Gribble said.
In CONNECTED, Gribble’s artwork is a perspectival portrait. In her TED talk, Gribble said, “Networks give us a sense of perspective.” It reaches the smallest and largest levels of connectedness in cells, nebulas and everything in between. The awareness and presence of connections that come out of her art highlights this enrichment through the expansion of social media, cyberspace and space itself.
“This series is a portrait of a networked society — exploring concepts of virality, group dynamics and social trends that connect us all,” Gribble said.
The series includes the 365-day project, four oil paintings, a wire sculpture, three large-scale etchings and a large-scale drawing of overlapping ecosystems. Each draws on interconnectivity and interdependence, constantly in dialogue with biological systems, anthropology and neuroscience.
In the exhibition, Gribble poses a question: What does it mean to be connected? If humans are so interlaced and interconnected, could the idea of the individual be lost?
In a recent interview Gribble noted, “With almost every piece of art, I was forced to work at such small-scale detail that I could not see the final work until the very end.”
In “Networked Life: 365,” the artwork came together by tracking each individual day throughout the year. The final result will not be finished until the end of the exhibition. In her large-scale drawing, “Social Unit,” Gribble depicts five different superorganisms (ants, bees, humans, naked mole rats and termites), drawn from a continuous line. She focused on each animal in order to show how thousands of organisms can be connected as a whole.
By the end, Gribble began to realize that everything is one; and one is everything. Therefore, our networks extend far from one’s own reach or understanding, but individuals still play crucial roles in forming the complete organisms or networks.
Gribble’s work recently won a competition as a top-10 finalist out of 30,000 participants called Art Takes Times Square. Her artwork has also been featured in different exhibitions around Southern California, such as the Palos Verdes Art Center and Superhighway.
 
The “CONNECTED” exhibit at the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery opened Monday and runs until Nov. 7. The opening reception will take place on Tuesday, Oct. 29, from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.

Bill Sharman, a USC alumnus and former coach for the Los Angeles Lakers, passed away Friday in his home in Redondo Beach, Calif. He was 87 years old.
Sharman was well known for his basketball success and was nicknamed “Bullseye Bill” for his efficacy at the free-throw line. He is also ranked in the top 25 in all-time high scorers at USC.
Sharman was a Troy letter-winner for four years, from 1947 to 1950. Sharman was selected as an All-American in 1950. In 1950, he was USC’s forward and scored 1108 points in 81 games for an average of 13.7 points per game, which was a record for USC at the time. As a senior, he averaged 18.6 points per game.
In 1949, he was chosen as USC’s Most Inspirational Player and in 1950, he was chosen as USC’s Most Valuable Player. Sharman played for the USC baseball team from 1949-1950 before signing a contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
After briefly working for the Brooklyn Dodgers, Sharman became an NBA star with the Celtics, and later a coach for the Lakers and in 1972 led the Lakers to their first National Basketball Association title. He was also distinguished as Coach of the Year.
Sharman is also known for inventing the “shootaround” as a way for players to calm their nerves on game days. He found that he felt less nervous if he shot a few baskets and dribbled the ball around before the game, and he brought this strategy with him to the teams that he coached.
Sharman also became the first coach to win championships in three different professional leagues, with the American Basketball League in Cleveland, American Basketball Association in Utah and the NBA in Los Angeles.
He later joined John Wooden and Lenny Wilkens as the only members in the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach.
In 2002, Sharman was put into the Pac-12 Hall of Honor and was part of USC’s inaugural Athletics Hall of Fame in 1994. His No. 11 USC jersey was retired in 2007 and is displayed in the Galen Center.
Sharman is survived by his wife Joyce, his two sons Jerry and Tom and his two daughters Nancy and Janice.

The controversy surrounding the rocky debut of the Affordable Care Act’s online marketplace is far from over. Though USA Today reported that 700,000 applications were submitted this week, little improvement has been seen on the actual website. This goes to show that online registration creates more harm than good. Though not fail-proof, in-person registration might still prove the best way for such large-scale systems.

When healthcare.gov opened on Oct. 1, 8.5 million people flooded the site, but none were able to register. The website, as it turns out, was tested only two weeks prior to going live, according to the Washington Post. This lack of foresight speaks to the many missteps that could have been prevented. For a highly anticipated healthcare plan, this outcome is extremely disappointing. The Post reported that website administrators declined to say when these problems would be fixed.
Seeing that uninsured people will be required in 2014 to carry health insurance or pay a fine, the prospects for the success of universal healthcare don’t look good.
Michael Astrue, the former commissioner of Social Security, issued a warning in the Weekly Standard this week. He stated that “Department of Health and Human Services decided to build political support for the Affordable Care Act by pouring money into supportive organizations so they could launch poorly trained workers into their communities without obtaining criminal background checks or creating systems for monitoring their activities.” These unaccountable workers, known as navigators, will have access to Social Security numbers and other private information, and could spawn a new breed of identity thieves.
Though the database that links federal agency records is useful to evaluate eligibility, it is also the “largest consolidation of personal data in our nation’s history,” according to the National Review. Inevitably, that data hub has become a magnet for identity thieves. According to the National Review, Minnesota’s health care exchange inadvertently released the Social Security numbers of 2,000 state residents before healthcare.gov was even launched on Oct. 1. John C.A. Bambenek, who works for nonprofit Internet Storm Center, told news site nextgov.com that as of last Wednesday afternoon, 700 copycat healthcare.gov sites had emerged, many of which host bogus insurance marketplaces.
A few other scams that have surfaced include a fake national insurance card pitched by conmen to obtain personal information and bank account numbers, according to Forbes.
Though the Affordable Care Act is well-intentioned, its website and execution is still suffering from many issues. The Obama administration should have ironed out these details prior to embarking on such an elaborate endeavor.

Only the govt can screw something up on such a massive scale and not really care too much since they are not paying for it. If this was a private company – you can bet their corporate web site will be fixed immediately because to not do so means hemorrhaging cash every second it is not working. However, since the govt can always just continue to tax and take money from citizens to pay for whatever crazed idea they have – it is status quo

Halloween is right around the corner. It’s evident, particularly on a college campus covered in fliers about Halloween party options. But this fall marks the launch of an even scarier trend: naughty Halloween costumes for toddlers.
According to MSN, Wal-Mart pulled its “naughty leopard costume” from store shelves following a heavy backlash. The costume was criticized for its scandalous nature.
But this isn’t an isolated incident. In fact, it shows a greater problem in society: the sexualization of young girls.
Another example of the overt objectification of society’s youth is the case of model Thylane Loubry Blondeau. She received criticism after appearing nude on the cover of Vogue magazine, covered only by a strands of bead necklaces. In today’s entertainment world, this set-up is a fairly normal occurrence. But the difference? Thylane is 10-years-old.
Equally shocking is French lingerie company Jours Après Lune’s line for girls ages 4 to 12, which has advertised its brand with photos of grade-school girls styled like porn stars.
The problems don’t stop with magazines. Even cartoons created for children such as anime feature scantily clad female characters.
Furthermore, according to Nielsen Media Research, the average child or teen watches three hours of television per day. During those three hours, 78 percent of the television material focuses on women’s bodies. Another large majority consistently pokes fun at women.
Additionally, according to the American Psychological Association’s Task Force Report on the Sexualization of Girls, “In music videos, women more frequently than men are presented in provocative and revealing clothing, are objectified, and typically serve as decorative objects that dance and pose and do not play any instruments.”
Though these magazines claim to be targeted at their age group, they are actually a major driving force in early sexualization. Seventeen Magazine, for example, plasters headlines all over its covers that are provocative in nature.
With headlines like “how to look super pretty” and “how to make him want you” spotlighted in nearly every issue, on pages accompanied by images of Photoshopped models, the media forces girls to prioritize superficial concepts in life.
Fortunately, there is hope. A 2012 Curia Market Research poll of 600 girls between the ages of 15 and 21 showed 51 percent think there is too much sex and violence on television. Evidently, even the market audience at which companies are targeting this sexualized image is not a fan of the idea.
“If I could talk to those companies, I would tell them that makeup, hair, and clothes, do not make you look beautiful. They don’t make you perfect,” 13-year-old Faith said to the APA. “Boys are going to look at you like, ‘You’re an easy sex target.’”
Faith has a point. It is time to draw the line. If we want young women to grow up with some sense of respect for themselves, it is imperative that society’s view of women changes immediately.
Unfortunately, sex sells. But sex cannot sell if the buyer does not want it. Companies will immediately snatch up whatever new attention grabber comes along, because the one thing that sells more than sex is popularity. Women have made great strides to reach the point they have now and it’s about time the media caught up with the trend.

Another large majority consistently pokes fun at women.   Where? All I ever see is the males made to look like crap in every way possible for “humor”. Females are sacred and off limits, with almost no exceptions.
Leave anime out of your uninformed agenda.
Much on this issue pivots around the sentences in the article “Unfortunately, sex sells. But sex cannot sell if the buyer does not want it…” So is Walmart, Seventeen Magazine or Jours Après Lune to blame or the idiotic chicks who desperately buy these products that are guaranteed to turn up their tramp index? At what point do we lay personal responsibility on the individuals that chose to present themselves in public the way they do or are we admitting many of these females are empty-headed people that only do what Madison Ave tells them?
Ha, ha.  :p    Um, sure….ok, so I’m 17.  How old should I be before I can wear a sexy Halloween costume without being “sexualized”?
Why the heck should I be any more concerned about girls being “sexualized” than guys being desensitized to violence by random violence in videogames, music videos, or in real life?
Shouldn’t REAL violence be of far, far greater concern than this?   And after that, factors like psychological problems, learning disabilities, broken homes, etc?
This “sexualization” is taboo campaign sounds like a way to find a cause that is more popular and less expensive for taxpayers than paying for better services to address the other social concerns I mentioned above.  More popular and less likely to increase your taxes, but not likely to be as effective, in my opinion.
