In the 1920s, there lived a grand dame. She was a beauty by trade and had charisma greatly coveted by gents, dames and royalty alike. Her name? Daisy Darling. 
When this Darling came to be, every lacemaker shuddered from a sudden atmospheric change that foretold an era in which they would be working overtime to grace her delicate features. At that same moment, first-name-sharer Daisy Buchanan was found dead from the shock that she had been knocked from the post of being the world’s greatest Daisy. In my conversation with Hannah Gardiner, a junior studying English and East Asian languages and cultures, we spoke about her very vintage vantage. 
Gardiner was a sophomore when she debuted the now-infamous Daisy, a grand whirlwind fantasy that drew on the feminine wiles of “Scooby Doo’s” Daphne and Wendy Darling from “Peter Pan.”
“The first time I ever performed was at Ground Zero,” Gardiner said. “My friend was with me and we were walking back from the gig. And he was like, ‘I’ve never seen you so happy.’ And it made me feel amazing. I’m a happy person in general, but it was a different level of being myself, like I’ve never been so authentically myself before.”
However, Daisy Darling had a different answer: “I’ve always been Daisy, darling, I just didn’t know before.”
Drag, by nature, has been an act of celebration and activism that is constantly stretched and recontextualized. For Gardiner, she felt a sense of freedom in this art form.
“I want to feel like a princess,” she said. “For me, total gender freedom is feeling hyperfeminine and feeling powerful … When I’m Daisy, I can explore my gender in a way that I don’t normally, because she’s so hyperfeminine. She caters to the female gaze instead of the male gaze.”
As drag reaches the mainstream, we’ve seen the political discourse and weaponization of anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiments reach the forefront of media. One of these instances is the various violent protests at “Drag Queen Storytimes” all across America, where false narratives have been created against drag performers. And yet, this “assault on gender norms” has brought life and joy into a community that has seen much persecution.  
“Drag is not a threat to anyone. It’s a form of expression. It’s beautiful,” Gardiner said. “And if you feel threatened by drag, then you’re missing the whole point of what drag is … I would say drag queens show people that they can be authentically themselves. And kids deserve to see that too, they deserve to be able to think that they can be themselves in that same way.”
One of Daisy Darling’s drag sisters, Ra Oblivion, bore testimony to the journey Gardiner braved. 
“Daisy is one of the most unique younger generation of drag queens that I’ve seen,” she said. “She has a clear vision and clear aesthetic that I admire …  what I’d like to say to her is: trust your drag, trust your instincts, trust your gut [and] don’t doubt your work.”
For those who haven’t delved deep into the greater drag narrative, autistic assigned-female-at-birth queens like Daisy Darling are seldom and few. During her time as a drag queen, there were times where she had to take extra measures to ensure her slay stays that way. Even so, Gardiner feels as though being autistic has influenced her drag. 
“A lot of autistic people, especially autistic AFAB [assigned-female-at-birth] people, have a heightened sense of imagination,” Gardiner said. “And I think that that’s really allowed me to unlock this persona that I’ve always had, but never knew how to channel before and drag was the conduit for that.”
In the simple act of owning her expression, Daisy Darling’s art could be seen as a quiet form of defiance in a heteronormative world. Drag’s thesis statement of inclusion isn’t just a tired syllabus copy-and-paste, nor is it an exclusive club. No, these queens are here to uplift.
“Anyone can do drag,” Gardiner declared. “We need more representation for AFAB queens and again representation for nonbinary kings and queens. And I think, especially, we want more representation for drag kings.”
As the “disabled drag doll of your dreams,” Daisy Darling is an angelic manifestation of Taylor Swift’s “Mastermind.” In addition to being an acclaimed queen in her own right, Gardiner has brought this femme fatale to life at a plethora of events around the Greater Los Angeles Area. This year, Daisy Darling is the executive director of the Queer and Ally Student Assembly’s 13th Annual Drag Show — one of the biggest collegiate drag shows in the country — which she has been planning since last June. Leading an enigmatic troupe of 14 incredible drag queens, Daisy Darling has quickly become a mentor in her own right. 
“Daisy Darling is like a big sister to me,” said Will Yeaman, a freshman majoring in theatre, also known as Willconique. “Not only has she taken me under her wig and given me several drag opportunities, but she has actually reformed my idea of what drag is. Daisy, a cisgender female drag queen, exemplifies that drag is for everyone of any gender or sexuality. This community is not exclusive, and anyone who has respect for the art form should be welcomed and celebrated.”
The future of Daisy Darling is just beginning to bloom. Their profile continuously grows with each show they do. She’s new to the game. She’s autistic. She’s an AFAB queen. Most of all, Daisy Darling is here to stay, in all her magical mystique.
To bear witness to Daisy Darling’s magic and majesty with your mortal eyes, find the queen — along with a pantheon of drag performers — at the 13th Annual Drag Show this Saturday. 
“You can look forward to a lot of stunts… and a stripteaser too,” Gardiner said. “[And] charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent.”

The representation of the self and one’s culture in artistry is delicate, yet when harnessed with precision and care, its power can reach far and deep. Viewers experienced this power first-hand at the day-long art exhibition “Current,” showcasing the work of Ukrainian-born artist Lina Kogan in USC Michelson Center Jan. 25.
At 20 years old, Kogan moved from Kyiv, Ukraine, to the United States, where she eventually graduated with a master’s degree in computer science, multimedia and creative technologies at USC in 2000. 
Kogan’s experience with technology, combined with her practices in the fine arts, has helped her produce works that are rich in theme and technique. Her “Current” collection was a perfect demonstration of dedication to depth.
Consisting of canvases small and large, the works in “Current” speak to viewers with minimalist expressions of landscape and color. From the pallets of blue, green and red, each piece stands out in telling its own variation of human emotion or inner expression. Looking closer at the pieces, it’s clear that these colors aren’t working alone, but are meticulously accompanied by the attachment of everyday physical objects, such as computer keys or legos. 
“It’s a presentation of our current life, full of technological objects that are sometimes making our lives easier, but sometimes making it even harder to focus,” Kogan said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
Gabriel Calub, a sophomore majoring in aerospace engineering, arrived at Wednesday’s exhibit with an interest in Kogan’s work from a class he was taking on the modern history of Russia. A fellow STEM student, he took appreciation for Kogan’s unique mixed media approach.
“I’m interested in the fact that the art is also influenced by somewhat of a technical background,” Calub said.
For Sydney Crowley, a junior majoring in international relations and non-governmental organizations and social change, a stand-out piece was “Persistence of Rewritable Memory.” 
This acrylic 24” x 18” piece from 2020 contains rectangular strokes of warm colors that contrast the cooler canvas background. What is most prominent about this artwork is its use of very fine and delicate orange thread forming arches along the edges of the canvas. Though they don’t dominate the painting itself, they create an effect in their fragility and red tone against the cool and abrasive textures found throughout the painting. 
“In here we have an orange thread that my grandmother brought from Ukraine. I have a lot of collage elements that are actually from Ukraine,” Kogan said. “It’s crazy because I did leave 30 years ago but still, our family brought some artifacts that I find in some, maybe in a box of buttons that my grandmother brought, I reach into that box and I find some funky objects, and I use them in the art. So I have a box of various things, and most of them are from the old world.”
Crowley referred to the piece’s use of thread as a sort of bridge between emotional and cultural experience with the fine arts.
“I loved her art piece where she used the thread from her grandmother, who passed away because … it’s just something very impactful, just familial ties, but also part of an abstract, technical art piece,” Crowley said. “So it just showed how many layers there are to her art that you would have never thought that that thread was significant, unless she told you about it.”
On Feb. 24, 2022, Russian forces launched a full-scale invasion on Ukraine, causing immense destruction in cities and the death of thousands of civilians, along with millions who have decided to flee Ukraine to escape the destruction. Crowley expressed that the recent conflict has become essential context for not just Kogan’s work, but the study of modern Russia as well.
“It was really important that if we’re going to discuss Russia and its current state, it’s intrinsically linked to the situation in Ukraine geopolitically,” Crowley said. “So it was important that we also elevate Ukrainian voices … and appreciate their experiences through this warring period.”

Every piece I’ve ever written was done so on my dorm room couch, alone in the early a.m. Depending on the content, I’d soundtrack these little sessions accordingly — whenever I write about fraternities, I find myself listening to Ethel Cain, while mentions of corrupt businesses are often followed with the soothing anti-capitalist rhythms of Noname. However, tonight is different. Tonight is silent.
It’s been nearly a week since the violent mass shooting directly following the Lunar New Year festivities in Monterey Park and yet, I can still feel my breath catching. These uneven breaths are the only company I can bear to have as I try to collect my thoughts. 
An “Editor’s Epilogue,” by nature, is supposed to chronicle what has led editors at the Daily Trojan to write in the first place and to show readers that us editors are human, too. Yet, despite having been vulnerable in my writing before, I feel almost uncomfortable sharing any of the pain I currently feel with recent events looming over me. 
In their response to the shooting, the Asian American Journalists Association included a guideline for reporting on Asian American communities, one of which stuck out to me.
“We urge newsrooms to empower and support their [APIA] journalists and colleagues, while not relying on them completely to be total experts on [APIA] communities,” it read.
Though I haven’t come to a conclusion — nor am I quite sure I ever will — about my role in writing on the Asian American experience, I’ve decided to utilize this opportunity as a meditation on the op-ed. Care to join me?
Since my primary school years, I’ve always understood the importance of representation. I come from a part of my city that is considered to be the “wrong side of the tracks” and a school district that has been deemed the fifth most diverse in America. In my application to USC, I exploited my pursuit of becoming the representation I needed — deserved, even — as a child. Later on, I would learn this to be a norm in post-secondary education. I can remember all the mornings I spent in Taper Hall, deconstructing and analyzing the trauma of minority writers for a grade.
As an Asian American writer, there is a complexity that often renders my successes bittersweet. People of color are so often made to create art of their trauma, as if this is the only realized method of “breaking through the noise” into the spaces they occupy. Otherwise, how would people find a way to care about you when you’re not giving them something to relate to?
For people like me, it can begin to seem as though writing about — and through — your pain is the only way to be regarded as human.
On one hand, it can be beneficial to be open, honest and vulnerable in writing. There are some opinion columnists that I keep coming back to, with a recent highlight being columnist Man Truong’s article about Asian familial norms. However, writers of color often walk the line between speaking our truth and being exploited as a ploy for relatability. Our current status as college-aged students only stresses these tipping scales. 
When we’re young, the only thing we’re well-versed in is our own past, and not even that. Therefore, we believe it’s all we’ve got to give. 
The reason I find myself so stuck as an Asian American in the aftermath of the shooting could be the fact that I don’t want to have to process how it makes me feel. As someone who is always expected to be reporting on newsworthy subjects such as these, I often find myself scraping into my own pain in order to write, without a chance to actually fully realize how it makes me feel. 
When we put recent traumas and freshest wounds into the ether, the critiques are seldom sparing and empathetic. We aren’t allowed the privilege of working through our emotions before they are processed for us. 
In my second of the four free therapy sessions the University “gifts” us, the counselor and I spoke about these dueling aspects. For as long as I can remember — which itself is not very far back — I’ve attempted to be an extremely transparent person. It’s worked to my detriment, and I’m still just beginning the healing process from exhausting everything I once had to give to people. It shouldn’t have been such a revelation for me to realize that honesty and trust were not mutually inclusive — I could continue being a truthful person without trusting everyone with my pain on a silver platter. 
This doesn’t mean we should all become jaded. We should be able to be direct and open without the danger of leaving our private selves for the taking — even if it were to come from a good place. Let pain be just that. We don’t have to turn our traumas into a masterpiece, and no amount of hurt will ever be “worth” anything.
I’m eternally grateful that people read my work and, as time goes on, I will continue to take up space within my work and the rooms I enter. However, I’ve decided to enter this Western and Lunar New Year with new intentions. To all my fellow writers, creators and artists of color, I’d like to remind you: You don’t have to be the change you want to see in the world, you only have to be the person you need. The rest will come.
So, no. I don’t owe you a headline. You’ll have to find your own.
“Editors’ Epilogue” is a rotating column featuring a new Daily Trojan editor in each installment and their personal experiences of living in what seems to be an irrepressible dumpster fire of a world. Au Chung is the digital managing editor for the Daily Trojan.

Lately, when I’m bored in class, I like to close my eyes and ask whether ChatGPT could’ve written what I’m hearing. It’s often a toss up.
Case in point: This week’s discussion question in my journalism class was, “Do you think today’s cell phones have made journalism better or worse, and why?”
What followed was a half hour of opining on the ingenuity of the smartphone and its historic, monumental, crazy, marvelous, staggering, extraordinary, awesome implications — just in case you forgot about your phone’s capabilities (or how to use an online thesaurus). 
Generic questions beget generic answers, and university professors ought to remember that in any context. ChatGPT, which could’ve written any one of those bland answers, is just another reminder of that fact.
The artificial intelligence chatbot that took the world by storm in November already has some declaring the end of high school English, college essays and human intellect as we know it. It’s a convincingly human writer — so much so that it might actually seem more human if it were worse at what it does — which is to say it’s perfectly understandable for a college professor to be wary of ChatGPT. 
But to discourage or even ban students from using the program would be missing the point. When the Mesopotamians invented the wheel, the correct question wasn’t “How can we ban these to preserve the old way of dragging our shit from place to place?” but instead “How can we use these to make our lives better?” I’ll admit there are crucial differences between the wheel and ChatGPT, but the point still stands.
ChatGPT, still in its developmental phase, already presents a compelling case that AI will forever change professions where written or spoken content is the ultimate product, including speechwriting, journalism, comedy and cinema. 
The program is effectively king of generic writing, and so long as the product is on par with a human’s work, I’m not sure I’d complain if marketing copy, budget reports, meeting minutes or even “just-the-facts” news reporting were written by a computer. But ChatGPT has also understandably drawn some skepticism.
“It’s grammatically right,” said Taly Matejka, a writing lecturer at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “It’s got good rhythm and cadence and sentence variety, but it doesn’t actually tell me anything specific that I don’t know already.”
ChatGPT wouldn’t get an A in her class, Matejka said, though she wants to use it as a tool to help her students learn. What many writers often forget when discussing ChatGPT is that we’re not talking about a sentient being whose writing and critical thinking compares to our own. It’s just a reflection of ourselves: It was trained on our own writing.
Whether ChatGPT could land an A in a prestigious university’s writing program is hardly the point. Most humans couldn’t land an A. The question is whether ChatGPT’s writing beats out the average human in some respects, and, if so, how we can use it as a tool to augment our own capabilities.
As of now, like Matejka said, ChatGPT isn’t able to piece together arguments and opinions deep enough to be particularly interesting. But it does beat most of us in its understanding of grammar and syntax, which is certainly going to require a reevaluation of writing rubrics.
“Was good grammar the thing we should’ve been stressing in the first place?” asked Mark Marino, a Dornsife writing professor. “To what degree has [grammar] been used to gatekeep from people who don’t have access to that mastery?”
Imagine if ChatGPT could help international students who speak English as a second language — or even domestic students who still struggle with grammar and syntax — write in standard, academic English. It’d level the playing field.
Where things get dicier is a scenario where students in writing courses like Matejka’s use programs like ChatGPT to help articulate their own lived experiences and worldviews. That forces us to ask: What do we really value? Is writing simply a proxy we use to evaluate the substance in our heads? Or is it an end in and of itself?
“What I’m teaching isn’t how to learn how to write like ChatGPT,” Matejka said. “What I’m teaching is, in part, learning who you are … what you actually mean and how to say it.”
Historically, it’s been nearly impossible to separate the quality of the writing from the substance of its underlying ideas. But perhaps ChatGPT will change that.
More broadly, ChatGPT and the host of copycat programs that are sure to follow are going to force a long-overdue reevaluation of our priorities in the world of academia. What are we really testing for? What do we really ought to be teaching our students? What’s the point of a school in the first place?
I’m not sure what the answers are yet — and there will no doubt be growing pains — but the only real way to get there is to welcome the changes now. So spin the wheel. Embrace the robot army.

I’ve been playing video games since I was little. My older cousin was the first person kind enough to provide me with a proper introduction to them, since my parents believed that I would get distracted from my studies — even though I was only six. He showed me his PlayStation 2 and the games he was playing at the time, mainly “FIFA Soccer 09,” “Yakuza 2” and “Call of Duty: World at War.”
Looking back, I honestly don’t know why he thought it was a good idea to show a six-year-old how to headshot people using an M1A1 Carbine and how to fight the Japanese mafia using arrays of combos. Nonetheless, I was grateful for this introduction to the world of games, however violent it may have been. 
For my seventh birthday, my father finally noticed that I genuinely enjoyed playing games and bought me a Nintendo DS. It was love at first sight. My bright pink DS was my best friend. I never went anywhere without it, even if it was just a quick trip to the grocery store, regular medical check-ups or my weekly tutoring sessions. “Mario Kart DS,” “Animal Crossing: Wild World” and “New Super Mario Bros.” were among the regulars that would greet my eyes whenever I would boot the console up. 
Now, a little older and with much better hand-eye coordination, I’ve moved on to playing mouse-and-keyboard PC games, ranging from First-Person Shooter games, Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas, action-adventure games, simulations and hundreds of other categories that I probably don’t know the names of. 
In time, my journey through video games came alongside the constant evolution of the complexity of games in all aspects, especially the art, music, voice acting performance, gameplay mechanics and narrative. Back then, whenever a new release on the DS came out, I’d probably see it in GameStop and buy it immediately. Today, it’s a little different. Every year, thousands of high-quality video games are released on multiple different platforms, fighting to be a bestseller on Steam and for a chance to be nominated for the prestigious Game of the Year award. 
I simply can’t buy every game I see in my Steam store — if I did that, I’d go broke. Now that I’m  older and (hopefully) wiser, I’d say I’m a little more selective about what games I choose to buy. In their own words, the Game Awards “recognizes and upholds creative and technical excellence in the global video game industry.” The annual show awards video games that deliver the best experience across all fields, including visuals, music, mechanics, narratives and art direction. The “Game of the Year” is the most important category — think of it as the “Best Picture” winner at the Oscars — in all of the Game Awards, and the winner is considered to take every category to the next level and deliver the “absolute best experience across all technical and creative fields.”
Last year’s “Game of the Year” winner was “Elden Ring,” an open-world action role-playing game that fantasy author George R.R. Martin helped develop. The game boasts incredible exploration mechanics, artistic and beautiful graphics, well-executed designs and notorious difficulty. While “Elden Ring” has been met with much critical acclaim, the game has also experienced a number of criticisms, as is the case with all video games. Most complaints are about poor PC performance, nontraditional user interface and user experience design and the lack of Martin’s writing style in the narrative. 
The sheer success, critical acclaim and popularity of “Elden Ring,” despite the lack of these key video game components — especially in UI/UX — prompted me to ask myself: What aspect of a video game actually makes me go, “wow, this is a good game?”
My answer? Replayability.  
I realized that replayability is the key aspect of every video game I’ve enjoyed — whether it’s a racing game like “Mario Kart,” a country-life role-playing game like “Stardew Valley,” a narrative-based adventure game like “Detroit: Become Human” or even an FPS game like “Valorant” or “Overwatch 2.” 
By replayability, I specifically mean the depth of replayability that a video game has to offer. Games can achieve this depth in several different ways: levels of difficulty, unique game modes, a variety of characters to play, new maps to play on, a number of weapons to use and assorted abilities or roles for each character.
The depth in replayability of all critically acclaimed and most popular video games is consistently astounding. Once you complete “Elden Ring,” you can choose to invade other players’ worlds, replay the main story by choosing a different route and narrative which leads to one of the six different endings or even create an entirely new character with new weapons to tackle bosses at even higher difficulties. The multitude of ways to play “Elden Ring” is the reason why you’re able to play the game over and over again without getting bored. 
There are only a few recognized games that are exceptions to this rule, which are story-based games that only have one or two different endings — think “It Takes Two,” “A Way Out” or “The Last of Us Part II.” These games are incredible, but for a different reason. Since they don’t have the same aspect of replayability that other games have, they will typically make up for it in other facets, such as the length of the game, different game modes or a multiplayer mode.
And speaking honestly? If I play a video game once and I don’t feel the urge to pick it up again, I do one of two things: I get a refund or it just sits idly, collecting dust in my Steam library.  
Successful video games excel at, among other things, possessing high quality and depth of replayability. It can be argued that graphics, level of difficulty, audio quality, music score, technical quality and gameplay mechanics are significant factors to consider when reviewing a video game. But replayability remains to be one of the most, if not the most important factor in determining the quality and excellence of a video game, as exemplified by the critically acclaimed and most popular video games in the modern age.

USC battled back from a double-digit deficit and defeated crosstown rival UCLA in front of a roaring home crowd to cap off a defining 77-64 win Thursday night.
The Trojans’ first matchup against UCLA this season came down to the wire on Jan. 5, as the Bruins narrowly escaped the game with a 60-58 win.
In the second and final matchup of the season between the bitter rivals, the Trojans jumped out to an early 12-6 lead, but found themselves down 37-25 at halftime. 
USC and UCLA shot 41.7% and 41.4% respectively in the first-half, but UCLA had the edge at the three-point line, shooting 55% compared to just 31% for the Trojans. After the Bruins found themselves down by 6 early in the first half, UCLA closed the half on a 17-6 run.
“Your best players have to step up in games like this,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield in a postgame interview. “We were getting pretty clean looks, but we weren’t playing with aggressiveness on offense.”
Similar to the first meeting between the two teams, the Trojans turned it around on both sides of the ball in the second half as senior guard Boogie Ellis led the way.
Ellis finished the game with a team high 31 points — the most he has scored in his collegiate career. Of the 31 points Ellis poured in for USC, 27 came in the second half on 7-10 shooting after a first half in which he shot just 2-7 from the field and 0-5 from three. 
Along with Ellis, fifth-year guard Drew Peterson scored 16 points on 6-10 shooting and made 3 out of his 4 3-point attempts.
“Me and Drew told the guys that we have been in this position before,” Ellis said. “Me and Drew have played in big games and big atmospheres, so it is really our job to calm the team down.”
The scoring efforts from USC’s two senior captains contributed to a second half in which USC outscored UCLA 52-27. 
“We were giving up too many threes early on,” Peterson said. “A big thing for us was rebounding in that second half and I think we limited them on the boards.”
In USC’s win over UCLA at Galen Center last year, the Trojans escaped with a narrow victory, but Ellis was held to zero points in the game. Ellis explained after Thursday night’s victory that he finds basketball unique because anybody can rise to the occasion on any given night.
“This game has highs and lows and tonight was a high,” Ellis said. “I worked hard for these moments and I definitely beat myself up for that performance, but Drew had it rolling [last season], that was his night. Tonight was my night.”
Defensively, the Trojans were able to hold senior UCLA guard Jaime Jaquez Jr. under his season average of 16.1 points per game, limiting him to 15 points on the night.
In the second half, the play that allowed the Trojans to regain the lead came with 12:18 left to play, off a turnover by senior UCLA guard Tyger Campbell in which Ellis stole the ball and found sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters for a transition layup.
Campbell was also a player USC was able to limit in the second half as he was held to just 4 points after a 10-point performance in the first half.
“We tried to put pressure on the guards so Campbell couldn’t get in the lane,” Enfield said. “Our centers Josh [Morgan] and Vince [Iwuchukwu] did a really good job of getting out on the ball screens and then getting back before they could reverse the ball or throw it in to their bigs at the rim.”
USC also won the turnover battle with just 9 turnovers committed to UCLA’s 13. In the previous matchup against the Bruins, USC turned the ball over 10 times compared to 8 turnovers for UCLA.
The Trojans’ win over UCLA marks only the second time this season the Bruins have lost two games in a row. USC now sits at 15-6 on the season, and 7-3 in the Pac-12. With only two wins separating first and sixth place, the conference is now wide open.
USC will next hit the court in a week, when they host Washington State at home next Thursday at 8 p.m.

Content warning: This article contains references to violence.
The past five days saw seven shootings take place in the United States, back-to-back, totaling 27 casualties. 
Some students said they were largely unsurprised at the frequency of mass shootings within the last few days.
“It’s not something that’s new,” said Colin Li, a freshman majoring in business administration. “But I think it’s important that we move forward and build understanding between communities.”
Karan Gill, also a freshman majoring in business administration, echoed Li’s sentiment, saying the Monterey Park shooting was “disappointing,” but that he wasn’t surprised by it. 
The first shooting was late Saturday night in Monterey Park, California, where a gunman fired indiscriminately into a ballroom dance studio. At least 11 people were killed, a majority of them of Asian descent. Then came Sunday, when a gunman injured 12 in a Baton Rouge, Louisiana nightclub. Monday saw two dead because of gang violence at an educational program for at-risk youth in Des Moines, Iowa. Tuesday saw four shootings: two in Half Moon Bay and one each in Oakland and Yakima, Washington.
Other students also expressed concerns about potential racial motivations behind the Monterey Park shooting. 
“It was definitely disconcerting, especially as a member of the Asian American community, to see shootings near me perpetrated against my own people,” said Henry Chen, a freshman majoring in computer science.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s office has yet to announce a motive. The suspect, 72-year-old Huu Can Tran, was an immigrant from China, his former spouse told CNN. Investigators are pursuing an apparent personal motive. 
“Some people take it a step too far where they think that their culture is better or worse than another one, and then that causes them to take drastic steps which can be easily avoided,” Gill said.
Michelle Lee, an exploratory freshman, said she felt as though the gunman chose the Lunar New Year celebration to specifically target people of Asian descent.
“They took that opportunity to just ruin all of it,” she said.
In a press conference Sunday, L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna told reporters that the weapon used in the Monterey Park shooting was at least illegally modified, if not itself illegal in California. The gun in question, a 9-millimeter MAC-10, was among those targeted in the 1989 assault weapons ban in California; A similar federal ban was enacted five years later. In 2016, California also passed Proposition 63, which prohibited the possession of high-capacity magazines and required background checks before purchasing ammunition.
Jeb Barnes, a professor of political science at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, said the ability to obtain guns outside of the state — as well as individuals passing down guns through generations — may have been possible avenues for the shooter to acquire the gun, despite the state’s extensive legislation.
“In a system of federalism — where you have widely varying gun laws and very little ability to stop the trafficking of guns across state lines, as well as a legacy of a lot of gun ownership before any kind of ban,” Barnes said, “it shouldn’t be surprising that a whole variety of weapons are available to people that technically should not be.”
The Monterey Park shooting was the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since May, when 19 students and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. Following the incident, Congress passed a rare bipartisan bill on gun regulations, enhancing background checks on citizens aged 18 through 21 and, for the first time, requiring juvenile records and mental health records to be vetted before purchasing firearms. Democrats were forced to strike out key provisions of the bill — including a ban on the sale of semi-automatic rifles to those under 21 — in order to secure its passing.
“Because we’ve constitutionalized the issue, we’ve tied our hands to passing the kind of comprehensive gun legislation that gun advocates would want to see,” Barnes said.  
Despite the proximity of the Monterey Park shooting to USC, most students interviewed by the Daily Trojan said they were not worried about safety on campus. From 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., the University places campus security at every entrance and exit, and requires identification for re-entry to campus grounds after sundown. 
Nohemi Vela Guevara, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, said she felt “a little safer inside of campus because of all the security we have.” 
The Department of Public Safety also patrols the area in and around campus at all hours of the day to ensure all students feel safe on campus. If there’s ever an emergency on campus, the blue light emergency system allows for students to access emergency services in a convenient and efficient manner.
“I still feel relatively safe,” Chen said. He doesn’t, however, feel safe leaving campus. “I feel safe to go to certain areas that I know are reputed for safety.”
Icesha Sanders, a freshman majoring in occupational therapy, said she was affected by the rising violence.
“Considering that it was only ten or so miles from here … even though this isn’t my home, it hit close to home, in a way,” Sanders said. 
Vela Guevara said she has been going about her daily routines since the mass shootings, but not without a sense of insecurity.
“Some of [the shootings] just happened really spontaneously,” she said. “To think that I could be doing my casual day-to-day things and it could happen at any moment — it’s honestly pretty scary to me. And I really hope it doesn’t happen.”

The No. 10 USC men’s volleyball team conquered the northern territories with a 3-1 win over California State University, Northridge Wednesday night. The win advanced the team’s record to 6-2 on the season. The Trojans, who had previously beaten CSUN 3-0 at the ASICS invitational, were looking to run the Matadors out of their gym with another big win. The Matadors hoped to defend their perfect 3-0 home record at the Matadome and pull off an upset victory. 
Both teams tried to impose their will in the first set, leading to a back-and-forth scoring affair. In the end, it was the Trojans who came out ahead. A kill by freshman outside hitter Dillon Klein and a service ace by junior setter Nate Tennant helped USC break a 17-17 tie, and they never looked back — winning the set 25-22 and going up 1-0 in the match. However, the Matadors made it clear in the second set that the game wasn’t going to be as easy for the Trojans as their previous victory against them. CSUN took advantage of the Trojans’ errors and built a lead of up to 11 points, then held on for a 25-19 set victory to even the match 1-1. 
The set loss was a tough stretch in the match that could have easily discouraged the Trojans, but senior libero George Dyer’s vocal leadership helped the Trojans keep their energy up and gain some momentum heading into the third set. Head Coach Jeff Nygaard credited Dyer for that leadership, which he said was equally a credit to Dyer’s vocal initiative and his high-level play. 
“George has always been a vocal leader for this team, but what I am proud to say is that his vocal performance is bolstered by the fact that he’s doing a nice job as a libero,” Nygaard said. 
The Trojans roared back in the third set, making a statement with a 25-16 win, equaling their largest margin of victory in a set all season. 
They kept momentum on their side in the fourth set, nearly equaling their effort from the third set with a 25-17 set victory to give them a 3-1 win in the match and a 2-0 sweep of the Matadors on the season. The win was fueled by a blocking clinic put on by the Trojans, who set a new season high with 11 blocks as a team. 
Nygaard credited the blocking performance to the Trojans’ understanding of CSUN’s offensive rhythm and ensuing adjustments they made to their timing. 
“I think once we got into the rhythm of the game they started seeing the game, [and] the game started to slow down for them,” Nygaard said. “Their cadence was on point to when they needed to be over the net.”
The blocking effort was led by season-best performances from both of the Trojans’ middle blockers. Junior middle blocker Kyle Paulson led the team in blocks with seven, a new career-high total for the third-year Trojan. 
“Kyle Paulson really stepped forward … he had a lot of major blocks tonight and put together a real good blocking performance,” Nygaard said. 
Paulson credited his success to diligent preparation. 
“I like to take in the game plan before the game and then just figure out what [CSUN’s] setter is doing and try to read the hitters,” he said. 
The Trojans’ other starting middle blocker, senior Lucas Frassrand, also put together an excellent performance. Frassrand matched his season high with four blocks and had two important service aces. 
Frassrand said tough serving was a big part of the Trojans’ success. 
“We were doing a good job of bringing some heat from the service line, which [also] makes it easier to put up a good block,” Frassrand said. 
Nygaard praised both middle blockers for their decision-making and leadership on the front line, saying those were the main factors in his teams’ elite blocking effort. 
“As a middle, you’re tasked with making those decisions in the front row to give everyone the best opportunity to score,” Nygaard said. “A lot of those [blocks] came from their read of the game … seeing what the other team is about to do and making a plan.”
Following their second consecutive win, the Trojans will look to extend their winning streak next week with two games against formidable Big Ten opponents, Penn State and Ohio State, in the Big Ten/Pac-12 Challenge. The tournament is set to take place in Pennsylvania, the furthest the Trojans have played away from home all season. That doesn’t bother Coach Nygaard one bit.
“We’re going to be in a rectangle on a floor with an eight-foot net and a ball, and it’s our job to play good,” he said. “What’s that got to do with where?”

The USC women’s basketball team is looking to extend their best start to a season since the 1993-94 season. They are coming off a sweep of Washington’s Pac-12 schools, with their latest win against Washington coming in a nail-biting overtime victory, 63-54. USC will be playing the nationally-ranked No. 9 Utah Utes on Friday in Salt Lake City. 
Second-season Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb still thinks the Trojans have a lot to prove.
“We’re trying to improve ourselves and I think that keeps momentum automatically,” said Gottlieb in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’re also cognizant of the good situation we put ourselves in, and no one wants to take steps back.”
The Trojans showed out in Washington, especially sophomore guard Rayah Marshall on the defensive end. Marshall grabbed a total of 29 rebounds against Washington and Washington State, while blocking a total of 10 of the opponents’ shots. Marshall brings a huge presence to the Trojans’ defense, standing at six-foot-four.
“She’s just a monster protecting the rim,” Gottlieb said. “Her timing is great, she’s learned a ton in terms of just how to manage the game from in the paint,” Gottlieb said. “We’re really lucky to have her.”
Last season, Marshall led all freshmen in the country in blocks per game with 2.54. This year she has topped that mark, now averaging 3.1 blocks per game in her sophomore campaign. 
“She’s there when we need her the most … Anytime any of the guards got beat, she was there and honestly we won the [Washington] game because of her,” said graduate guard Destiny Littleton.
The Utes are 16-2 in the season, and specifically 6-2 in conference play. They have a perfect 8-0 record at home in the Jon M. Huntsman Center. Their leading scorer and rebounder, junior forward Alissa Pili, averages 20.1 points and 5.7 rebounds per game. Notably, Pili transferred from USC last spring. 
The Trojans are looking to play their style of basketball to get the win against the Utes.
“We can’t focus too much on other teams,” Marshall said. “We do know we’re going to come out with our best effort and whatever that looks like for us, just doing whatever is necessary to hopefully go home with a victory.” 
The Trojans have won eight of their last ten games against the Utes dating back to the 2017-18 season. Last season, they split the season series against each other, losing their first matchup 69-91, then winning the finale 83-62. 
USC has some wins against some really tough opponents in the Pac-12, including then-second-ranked Stanford on Jan. 15. They have caught the country on notice.
“We have a target on our back now,” Littleton said. “Everything that we do, we have to be clean with it, value every possession going into the weekend … we’re locked in every single day and not taking any day for granted.” 
Littleton, a transfer from last year’s national champion South Carolina, has been clicking the right buttons on offense the past couple of games. She has 18 or more points in three of the past four games for the Trojans, including a 20-point game on Sunday over Washington. 
Her teammate, Marshall, praised her leadership on the court.
“She’s a leader, she’s vocal … she knows what needs to get done and what’s necessary, and she’s been doing a great job [playing point guard],” Marshall said.
Littleton and Marshall look to carry the Trojans to extending their winning streak at Utah Friday at 6 p.m.

The “First Year Experience” — a new Transfer Student Assembly initiative — aims to help first-year transfer students navigate the USC community by organizing various activities such as bonfire events, mentor advising, retreats and bi-weekly dinners. 
Unlike the previous Emerging Leaders Program — a peer mentorship project for all transfer students that ended in Spring 2022 — the first-year initiative specifically focuses on building a community for new transfer students through networking activities and mentoring opportunities. 
“We’re trying to help guide [first-year transfer students] through a lot of experiences that they most likely have not had at their previous university,” said Sophia Tabares, a senior majoring in neuroscience and co-director of TSA. 
The first part of the initiative consists of a group competition. Each group is made up of six members who must participate in a wide range of activities — including frisbee tournaments and hikes — designed to create a small community within themselves. The group’s involvement in each activity will dictate their ranking, which is designed to encourage participation.
Weekly meetings will also give members the opportunity to get to know each other. Every week, TSA will choose a topic to lead the conversation in hopes of helping students connect. New member groups are also encouraged to spend this time doing group-bonding activities. 
“It’s gonna be a casual conversation with questions that we have. Some questions are like, ‘what’s your hottest take?’” said Drew Driscoll, a senior majoring in economics and new membership director for TSA. 
Another part of the initiative is a mentorship program, which includes regular one-on-one meetings with TSA executive board members and pairings between first-year and upperclassmen transfer students. The mentors can share tips and introduce resources, such as the transfer forgiveness and transfer credits policies, to the first-year transfer students. 
Driscoll, a transfer student from George Washington University, said that transfer students can have a hard time being accepted into clubs and organizations on campus. Thus, the program will collaborate with other student organizations to serve as a pipeline for its members to explore their interests in the USC community. 
“It’s an incentive for clubs to accept [traditional freshmen] because they’ll have more time and they’ll get more involved in the club,” Driscoll said. “This has a detrimental effect on the transfer community … they don’t get into clubs and they feel rejected from the USC community.” 
The application to join the initiative, which includes several short-answer questions, is now open to both first-year undergraduate and graduate transfer students and will close Feb. 5. 
TSA expects to accept around 30 students for the program. The organization’s goal is to maintain a small group to ensure every member gets the resources they need. 
“Any transfer student that feels like they would benefit from this program, we would encourage them to apply,” Tabares said. “We would love to meet as many students as possible.”
