The No. 1 USC women’s swimming and diving team swept the 200y medley and free relays, while junior Haley Ishimatsu won the 3-meter springboard to give the Women of Troy a win in the six-team 2013 SMU Classic in Dallas from Friday, Oct. 18 to Saturday, Oct. 19 at SMU Perkins Natatorium.
USC was also able to show the depth of their team, also knocking out Washington State 146-116 in a Pac-12 meet on Friday.
This year’s SMU Classic marked the 20th year of the annual meet. USC won last year’s Classic, winning by 73.5 points, in large part due to victories in five of the nine events.
USC, which finished the event with 312 points, secured the win in the final 200y free relay with a time of1:30.38, thanks to the efforts of senior Kasey Carlson and sophomores Kendyl Stewart, Jasmine Tosky and Kasia Wilk. No. 13 Indiana, which took second place with 304.5 points, took second in the 200y free relay as well, finishing in 1:31.94. The USC quartet also opened the second day with a win in the 200y medley relay in 1:39.10.
USC and Indiana were followed in the standings by No. 16 Louisville with 280 points, No. 15 North Carolina, last year’s runner-up, with 276 points, SMU with 275.5 and Miami with 176.
USC got off to a strong start on the first day, thanks to wins from Ishimatsu in the 1-meter and freshman Chelsea Chenault in the 200y free. Chenault, who won her first individual event of her collegiate career, also won the 800y free, along with seniors Stina Gardell and Meghan Hawthorne and sophomore Wilk in 7:07.92, finished just short of an NCAA ‘A’ cut.
Ishimatsu, who won platform in the 2013 NCAA championships, won the 1-meter springboard with 304.90 points.
The Women of Troy didn’t win an individual swimming ‘A’ final, but earned four third-place finishes. Stewart finished the 200y back in 1:58.37, Wilk finished the 100y free in 50.57, Tosky finished the 200y fly in1:57.23 and Gardell finished the 200y IM in 1:59.80. Carlson also won the 200y breast ‘B’ final with a time of2:10.83.
The women’s swimming and diving team will have a couple weeks to rest and prepare before their next meets. They will travel to Arizona to take on Arizona State in Tempe on Friday, Nov. 8 at 1 p.m. PST, then take on Arizona in Tucson on Saturday, Nov. 9 at 11 a.m. PST.

On Nov. 1, 2012, Raishad Hardnett dodged a swarm of reporters, cameras and news crews as he headed to his morning classes.
This day was unusual for other reasons, too. When Hardnett walked into class that day, he noticed a fraction of students who made themselves undeniably noticeable. They were covered in USC apparel. And most of them were black.
From his personal experience as a black student, Hardnett had a theory as to why. It was a reaction to a community’s lack of inclusion, he thought.
“I felt like I didn’t belong at this school all of a sudden,” said Hardnett, a senior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. “After all the things that I had put into it, all the resources, the time, the effort, all the money — I felt like I could no longer relate to the university.”
The night before, the Black Student Assembly hosted more than 400 guests at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center for a Halloween party. By 11:45 p.m., dozens of students were dancing to blasting music in the center’s underground ballroom. Above ground, others waited in line to enter. But that crowd dispersed shortly before midnight. Gunshots rang out.
The on-campus shooting, which did not involve any USC students or faculty, sent four non-university affiliated victims to the hospital. Police arrested and charged the alleged shooter, Brandon Spencer, a black 21-year-old, with four counts of attempted murder.
In the days following, many believed the event caused a rift between the university’s black community and the rest of campus.
Several black students explained that they began to feel ostracized when online commenters called the party a “ghetto nightclub” and suggested that violence was unavoidable for black students on the Daily Trojan and Los Angeles Times websites.
This feeling was not lost on Hardnett. Despite his involvement on campus as a journalist for Neon Tommy and Annenberg Television News and as the president of the historically black fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha, he felt his skin color had become his main identifier.
“My sentiments were definitely mirrored around the community,” Hardnett said. “We felt like we were being looked at as outsiders — as black people. Wearing Trojan gear was the only way to say, ‘Hey, I’m not a hoodlum, hey, I go here.’”
From the time of its inception, the relationship between the University of Southern California and its black student population has been constantly adjusting.
Since the early 2000s, black students have comprised about 5 percent of USC’s nearly 18,000 undergraduates. The approximately 900 black undergraduates make up USC’s smallest racial minority group.
At the same time, the black community has deep roots at USC and in the surrounding area. But the community often comes into conflict with the local authorities after accusations of racial profiling.
This relationship came to a head on May 4 when 79 Los Angeles Police Department officers responded to a noise complaint at a party with helicopters and riot gear. The party, just north of campus, was attended predominantly by black students. The incident led to a student movement, which focused on curbing racial profiling. Organizers of the movement put on several rallies and events, making waves on social media and adopting the name “USChangeMovement.”
The uncertainty of belonging on campus and the responses to last year’s high-profile incidents have led many black students to evaluate their place in the Trojan Family.

‘Making Moves and Movements’
To protest the perceived aggression toward minority students by LAPD, Hardnett once again pulled out his USC gear and, on May 6, joined more than 100 students in a sit-in in front of Tommy Trojan.
In the aftermath of the alleged racial profiling incident, a forum discussion was organized to feature LAPD, the Dept. of Public Safety and students in the filled-to-capacity Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom, the same room where the Halloween party had taken place months earlier.
During the event, many students compared LAPD’s response to the May 4 party with their response to a party across the street that had a majority of white students in attendance.
LAPD opened an internal investigation, yet at the forum Capt. Paul Snell of the LAPD Southwest Division said they did not believe it was a case of racial profiling.
“We do not believe at this point that there were any indications that this was race-based,” Snell said. “What I would like to focus now on is how we can move forward. We do not want this to happen again.”
Similar to the Halloween shooting, the USChangeMovement was heavily covered by the media, from outlets ranging from the Los Angeles Times to the Huffington Post. Hardnett, however, said the USChangeMovement created a more supportive climate for black students on campus because several other minority groups, such as Latino and Jewish students, expressed a feeling of marginalization by authorities.
“We were being discriminated against by LAPD,” Hardnett said. “But the response from the students was amazing and was widespread from people of all creeds and backgrounds.”
James White, assistant director of the Undergraduate Student Government Diversity Affairs Committee, however, questioned the administration’s respect for the black community, noting that it took four days for President C. L. Max Nikias to issue a statement.
“I felt like a black man at this university that may or may not care for us the way they care for others,” White said.
In his statement, issued on May 8, Nikias said he had been communicating with DPS and his senior staff since the incident. He expressed concern for students’ well-being and said he was optimistic about continuing an amiable relationship between USC and its students.
“We are confident we will move ahead from this issue in an even more productive and positive manner,” Nikias wrote.
Student-led movements at USC have a long history of moving the university forward. Lois Pitter-Bruce, a black 1978 alumna, said student activism was prominent during her time at USC.
“Efforts are always made to reach out when there are difficulties,” she said. “There were black, Hispanic and Asian organizations. Whatever happened in that community, those communities made the campus and administration move forward and resolve anything that needed to be done.”
The past year’s events are still mobilizing the black community, Ama Amoafo-Yeboah, executive director of the Black Student Assembly, said, citing increased involvement in the surrounding communities and student activism on campus.
“I feel like people are making moves this year,” she said. “Everyone is trying to do something and it’s amazing to see it happen.”
 
‘Staging community’
Some of the university’s founders and first students struggled with accepting the black community at USC. The university’s second president Joseph Widney wrote a book called Race Life of the Aryan Peoples in 1907, which highlighted and analyzed the superiority of Caucasians throughout history, as compared to minority groups.
Around the same time, USC students staged a petition to expel a black dentistry student, John Somerville, according to the university’s Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs website.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the beloved mascot Traveler, a fixture at USC football games, was named in honor of Confederate general Robert E. Lee’s horse that accompanied the general in many battles against the Union during the Civil War.
Today, mindsets at the university have changed dramatically, as they have across the nation. USC explicitly states that it strives to create an environment where racism, bigotry and discrimination of any kind are reprimanded.
Yet, USC officials said students’ concerns with racial profiling are not unfounded.
DPS Chief John Thomas, a lifelong Angeleno who grew up near the University Park campus in the 1960s and 1970s, said he had personal experience dealing with racial profiling around USC.
“If you’re an African-American coming up on this campus, you might be profiled,” Thomas said. “I know I was. That gives me perspective when people say, ‘I was racially profiled’ and made to feel a certain way. I cannot negate that because that happened to me when I was coming up on this campus as a teenager.”
In January, the university implemented new security measures, which include requiring students to show USC identification to enter campus from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. and building fences at the entrances at Exposition Boulevard and Jefferson Avenue.
Many students said the new measures might lead to more cases of racial profiling and White said perceived racial profiling could have a strong reverberating effect.
“It’s emotionally draining for some of the students,” he said. “It’s bad for the university because if some of your students don’t feel safe on campus — and they’re the ones to promote the school — then they won’t be able to do that.”
To support students of African heritage, there are more than 40 student organizations on campus. Among them are the Black Student Assembly, Africa ’SC, and eight of the National Panhellenic Council fraternities and sororities. Many of the organizations, Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs Director Corliss Bennett-McBride said, are grounded in community service, political activism and religious faith.
In addition to the student organizations, the university has taken internal steps to support black students.
In 1977, the university created the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs. The center’s services include academic support and professional development, and it seeks to attract and retain more black USC students.
Within housing, the university created Somerville Place, a black special interest floor located in Fluor Tower named after John and Vada Somerville, in 1995.
Bennett-McBride, who has worked at USC for 17 years, said the Somerville floor is an essential space on campus because when students are connected to their cultural community, they have a higher retention rate and involvement in school life.
“It was made to help black students transition to a predominantly white institution,” Bennett-McBride said. “It acts as their home away from home where people understand what they’ve gone through during the day.”
Despite the support systems, the views of some newer members to USC’s black community have been shaped in part by the incidents of the past year.
When Katrina Miller, a freshman majoring in English, heard about the Halloween shooting and USChangeMovement as a prospective student, she considered the impact her race would have on her experience at USC.
“I know I have to face race issues wherever I go,” Miller said. “But I kept thinking how ridiculous it was that those things actually happen. It was cool to see how united the [black] community was and it put some faith back into USC for me.”
 
 ‘There’s A Divide’
The size of USC’s black student population is comparable to other California universities, such as UCLA with a 3.9 percent black student population, UC Berkeley with a 3.4 percent black student population and Loyola Marymount University with a 5.6 percent black student population.
Tim Brunold, USC dean of admissions, said he believes the university is up to par on the admission rates of black students, especially when USC competes with other prestigious universities in the nation, such as the Ivy League schools, Stanford, Duke and UCLA.
“If you look at the academic caliber of our African-American students, these are some of the very best African-American students from the country,” Brunold said.
Though black students at USC share similar backgrounds, some who were interviewed for this story believe they could be more socially unified.
“I wish we were more cohesive,” said Rebecca Berry, a junior majoring in sociology. “Parts of us are cohesive, but there’s a divide between the athletic black students and the academic students. There’s a divide between students that are more involved in Greek life on The Row and black Greeks. We need to find a way to unite all of us.”
When Makiah Green, a graduate student pursuing a master’s in professional writing, first entered the university as an undergraduate in 2009, she struggled to establish a network with her black peers.
“I didn’t feel a connection to the black community at all,” Green said. “I could already sense that it was divided.”
To Trevian Hall, a sophomore majoring in theater, being grouped by his race was not a main concern for him on campus.
“My race is an identifier but I don’t identify by my race,” Hall said. “I’m proud to be black. But at the same time being black isn’t what makes me. It’s definitely shaped who I am today, but it’s not me.”
Several black students at USC have identified a variety of differences in cultural practices that make it difficult to connect with one another.
Hardnett said when black Trojans encounter one another, they don’t always show signs of acknowledgement. The lack of connection led BSA to go as far as to stage a “Say Hi” campaign in 2010. They created “Say Hi” buttons and fliers to encourage black students to say hello when they walked past one another on campus.
Similarly, Somerville has undergone shifts in demographics of students living on the floor. An equal number of black women and men have not lived on Somerville since 2009, Bennett-McBride said.
Though current residents say the floor fosters awareness of the black community, Bennett-McBride said fewer black students matriculating through USC are the first in their families to attend college, which she thought leads some to feel mentorship and fellowship among their black peers is less necessary.
She said first-generation students were more likely to want help navigating through the university because they did not have parents or other immediate family members who had direct experience with the college process.
White also recognized the growing differences between black students’ backgrounds, but believed everyone in the black community should strive to bridge the divide with their peers who look like them.
“There’s some of us that are somewhat detached in one way or another,” White said, “People should at least involve themselves in some way.”
 
‘Row Out and Meet It’
To see the ways in which the black community has impacted USC, one needs only to walk inside the Ostrow School of Dentistry. Inside hangs a quote from Somerville, one that defined his mission in life.
“Do not wait for your ship to come in. Row out and meet it,” Somerville said.
Today, many black students said they use the struggles of the past to fuel their goals for the future.
“We can use these issues and recent events as motivation to bridge the gap between communities,” Hardnett said.
Students said that in addition to promoting the USChangeMovement, they wanted to continue supporting the university’s established initiatives that connect them with the surrounding community. The Neighborhood Academic Initiative, a seven-year pre-college program for low-income students around USC’s campuses, offers full scholarships upon completion, is notable. Many of the scholarship recipients are either black or Hispanic.
Brunold said though the university has made great strides in building their diversity and enrolling the brightest black students, there is still work to be done.
“When we’re talking about diversity, we are never talking about how we made it,” Brunold said. “We’re never as diverse as we want to be or should be. We’re always striving to increase diversity in all of its forms.”
Many black students continue to echo the same sentiments. At USC, they still face the struggles associated with past generations of black Trojans, but like any other student, they are proud and hopeful for the future that lies ahead.
Amoafo-Yeboah was one of these students. She views past difficulties as setting an ideal stage for the black community at USC.
“It’s the perfect time for people to be here,” Amoafo-Yeboah said. “It’s the perfect time for us.”

This is the first in a series about the demographics of USC. The next installment will run Monday, Oct. 28.
 
What does it really mean to say someone doesn’t feel like they belong at USC? If international students from China said they do not feel like they “belong” at USC what would be the response? 
If a white person goes to Leimert Park or go see the Watts Towers and on both occasions are accosted by young black men that he is dumb white trash (as i have been) how deeply reflective and resentful should I be that I do not feel like I “belong” Leimert park and Watts?
Or, do I just shrug off that chip on my shoulder and move on and NOT let that unpleasant experience color my entire view of those places?
I wouldn’t marginalized your experience – and your anger, disappointment,etc should be directed at those who accosted you. That is not a chip on your shoulder. Your scenario is nothing like what the students have experienced. If that was their experience in Beverly Hills or Orange County, maybe.  A student should not ever be made to feel that way. That’s akin to someone coming into your home and insulting you.
And that should read marginalize (autocorrect)
Ras, your experience cannot compare to what students of color experience not just at USC but in many other places. If you look back at your history, black people and other people of color have always been kept away or made to feel like they don’t belong in certain places. Even in places where they are considered to be the majority, there have always been cases of discrimination and violence against them. Look up Watts Riots of 1965.
Should you be concerned about what happened to you at Watts? Is it preventing you from moving forward with your aspirations? People of color who feel like they dont belong at institutions such as USC ultimately have to deal with it everywhere in order to reach higher places that white people have had the privilege to reach without as much work. People of color have to work twice as hard to get half of what white people get with less work just because white supremacy is at work in society and so no, your experience is nothing worth discussing.
in short,racism against whites does not exist.
This is a very good article.  Nice job, Jordyn.
This new series is a top-notch idea! I hope that the Daily Trojan continues to write long-form journalism on subjects of interest to the USC community.

Students filled Bovard Auditorium on Friday night to hear a discussion from prominent scientist Richard Dawkins. The scholar, who received his education at the University of Oxford and UC Berkeley, is an outspoken critic of religion.
Appetite for wonder · The controversial atheist Richard Dawkins discussed his memoir and his aims to free education from the grasps of religion on Friday at Bovard Auditorium. – Anna Schwartz | Daily Trojan
 
The event was hosted by the Alliance for Inquiry and Reason, the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, USC Norman Lear Center, USC Office of Religious Life and USC Spectrum.
D.J. Grothe, a prominent scientific writer and speaker, interviewed Dawkins on a variety of topics ranging from Dawkins’ childhood memories to his condemnation of religion. Grothe also read excerpts from Dawkins’ new book, An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist.
Grothe began the conversation on a personal note by asking whether Dawkins had discovered false memories while writing his memoirs. Dawkins noted that he and his mother had differing accounts of him being stung by a scorpion during his childhood in colonial Kenya.
“I have an extremely clear memory that I was walking across the floor with my bare feet and I saw what I thought was a lizard. How painful, as a biologist, to think that a scorpion was a lizard,” he joked. “My mother’s recollection is that I got off my chair at the dining table, and the scorpion was under the table. Her version, on the face sounds more plausible, but my memory is astoundingly clear, so I don’t know what to make of that.”
Dawkins also reflected on what the process of writing an autobiography is like.
“Critics of the book have complained that this autobiography is all about the author. I can’t tell you what I could do about that. But I do in a way empathize with them because I do feel a bit self-conscious writing about myself,” he said.
Dawkins also discussed his controversial reputation.
“I guess I do get a bad rap in a sense that I am sometimes portrayed as more vitriolic and aggressive and things like that. I’m actually quite a nice person. I don’t approve of vitriol, I don’t approve of profane language. But I don’t mind poking fun at them,” Dawkins said of religious figures.
He noted that he believed in promoting his views when Grothe asked if he hoped to liberate others from their beliefs.
“My priority is finding truth. That’s what I really care passionately about,” Dawkins said. “I believe in education and freeing people from false education that religion can inspire.”
Many students said they appreciated the fact that the Office of Religious Life hosted an event featuring a prominent atheist scholar.
“The Office of Religious Life is not just about a specific religion. I think they’re inviting free thinkers, secular ideas,” said Sonia Gumuchian, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television.
Nonreligious students felt that the event reflected a greater acceptance of their beliefs.
“I joined Alliance for Inquiry and Reason this year, and we’ve reached out to the Office [of Religious Life],” said Celeste McAlpin-Levitt, a freshman majoring in comparative literature. “They’ve been generous with funding and getting us involved in this event. It’s nice that they’re reaching out to atheists on campus.”
Religious students also said they appreciated hearing a differing perspective.
“I think it’s really interesting to hear a different point of view and figure out what everyone is saying,” said May Yang, a junior majoring in business administration and psychology. “Instead of being defensive, you can be critical about your belief and religion.”
Other students agreed with Yang that part of religion is examining belief systems.
“A point of religion is not to believe something that makes us feel good,” Jeremy Malek, a senior majoring in business administration, said. “I’m a Christian and I think it’s really important to be naturally inquisitive, to know both sides of the story and to know why we believe this.”
I was at this event. It was very well done and a great time was had by all I think.
I was the adviser to the student atheist group for five years and was very appreciative of how the the Office of Religious Life accommodated us. We were welcome and active members within Religious Life and got to make many great associations with the other groups.

The rivalry between USC and Notre Dame didn’t only play out on the field this weekend.
The USC Red Cross Club hosted its 2013 USC vs. Notre Dame Rivalry Blood Drive from Oct. 11 to Oct. 18.
The Rivalry Blood Drive is a competition with the University of Notre Dame to see which school can collect the most blood within the week. Stations where students could donate blood were set up at McCarthy Quad, Harris Residence Hall and University Village.
This year, USC collected 142 units of blood. Notre Dame’s results are not yet known.
In past years, the Blood Drive competed with crosstown rival UCLA, but their numbers were too low to elicit much of a competition, according to USC Red Cross Club President Diana Chung. Notre Dame proved to be a new challenge.
“Notre Dame is definitely not an easy rival,” Chung said. “They reach out not only to their campus but their entire community around campus, which we aren’t able to do because of security measures.”
The event is meant to coincide with the USC vs. Notre Dame football game.
“At the end of the weekend it’s like a kind of culmination with the football game to see who wins the blood drive and who wins the football game,” said Madelyn McCadden, a sophomore majoring in global health and a member of the Red Cross Club.
The blood drive was sponsored by various organizations including Chicanos/Latinos for Health Education, Vietnamese Student Association, Alpha Phi Omega, Trojan Pride, Tzu Ching Trojans, Delta Sigma Pi, Panhellenic Council and Associated Students of Biomedical Engineering, which sent volunteers to help run the drive.
One of the volunteers, Shelief Juarez, a sophomore majoring in political science and biology and member of the Chicanos/Latinos for Health Education, said she enjoys being able to give back.
“It’s a really good opportunity to help around campus,” Juarez said.
Students showed up to give blood for a variety of reasons, either by walk-in or appointment.
Ryan Burrow, an undeclared freshman, mentioned that his fraternity is involved in a community service initiative and was looking for ways to contribute.
“We’ve been seeing this truck on campus all week and we thought me might as well all go out and do it,” he said.
The club reports that every donation will save three lives.
Chung noted that some people must be turned away for a variety of reasons, such as being sick within the last week or having an iron deficiency.
“We definitely have to turn people away,” she said. “We want to make sure that the blood itself that we give to sick patients isn’t contaminated.”
Men who have had sexual relations with other men since 1977 are also not allowed to donate.
“There was a thing where we had to turn away someone that was gay,” McCadden said. “There’s a federal law still in place where they won’t take blood if you’re gay because of the risk of HIV.”
Kyron Richard, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said he was turned away after filling out the personal questionnaire.
“[The Red Cross attendant] was really respectful about it, but he basically told me there was an FDA regulation that didn’t allow men who had any kind of sexual contact with men since ’77 to donate blood,” Richard said.
Even still, Chung considers this year’s drive to have had a successful turnout.
“This year we didn’t have as many appointments,” Chung said. “But we definitely had a lot of walk-ins, which more than made up for the appointments.”

Ok. Wow.
This piece kind of went everywhere. It’s titled to discuss and begins by discussing the USC/ND rivalry. It then moves to the drive and their sponsors. It then moves to rejecting people from donating and goes into an aside discussing federal restrictions for MSM (men who have sex with men) blood donation…? I mean, what…? It either should’ve focused on the rivalry/numbers/turnout/winner or the larger picture gay donation/restrictions/MSM/cultural shifts/etc., not both.
Matt, I’m sure you’re a fine writer. This one wasn’t quite your best work. This article is lacking a lot of focus and the editing staff should’ve picked up on that before publishing.

The USC women’s soccer team took its talent to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, hoping to keep building some momentum after a strong performance up north the previous weekend. Unfortunately, despite a late comeback, the Women of Troy were unable to leave the Coliseum with a win, losing 3-2 in overtime to Arizona on Friday.
Can she kick it? · Senior midfielder Haley Boysen attempts a bicycle kick shot in the Trojans’ 3-2 loss to the Arizona Wildcats on Saturday. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
Just eight days after the USC football team started the Orgeron era with a 38-31 win over the Wildcats at home, the Women of Troy (6-7-2, 1-4-1 Pac-12) hoped to follows suit against the Wildcats in conference play. After going winless in their first three conference matchups with no goals scored, USC went up north and earned a 1-1 tie against California and upset then-No. 5 Stanford 1-0 in Palo Alto, with junior midfielder Alex Quincey scoring both goals.
USC appeared to carry that momentum against Arizona (7-5-3, 2-4-0 Pac-12), keeping up the pace and pushing an early advantage. A combination of strong ball movement up front and tough defense from freshman defender Mandy Freeman gave the Women of Troy a 12-2 shot advantage in the first half, including a 2-1 lead in shots on goal. Junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley made a couple of acrobatic saves to keep Arizona off the scoreboard. The first half was punctuated by a last-second bicycle kick from senior midfielder Haley Boysen, which went just left of the post as time expired.
Arizona matched USC’s intensity in the second half, putting quite a few close shots on goal to start the half.
Arizona started off the scoring in the 76th minute, when forward Kaitlyn Lopez took a shot from the top of the box to the top left corner past the outstretched hand of Stanley, giving the Wildcats a 1-0 lead. Arizona added to their lead just minutes later, as Lopez drew a foul in the box from sophomore defender Marlee Carrillo, earning a penalty kick and a yellow card for Carrillo. Forward Jazmin Ponce successfully converted the kick, giving the Wildcats a 2-0 lead with 12 minutes remaining.
The Women of Troy, not ready to throw in the towel yet, went right down the field, looking to make up for the deficit. They broke through in the 83rd minute as freshman midfielder Kayla Mills sent a corner kick into the box. The ball deflected off an Arizona defender and right in front of Carrillo, who was able to cut the deficit to 2-1 on her first goal of the season. Mills sped down the field in the 86th minute, drawing a foul just outside the box. Mills sent the free kick in the box, again to Carrillo, who tied it up at 2 all on her second goal of the game and sent it into overtime.
“After those kinds of things happen, there’s a little bit of guilt felt, and you really want to make up for it,” Carrillo said. “I think overall, with every moment, you want to give it everything you have, whether you mess up or whether you don’t.”
After USC made an early push to continue their momentum, Arizona got control of the ball. They were able to drive down the field, but after some interesting foul calls on Freeman and senior defender Autumn Altamirano, Ponce was able to get a free kick just outside the box. Ponce saw a chance to put the game away, curving the ball towards the upper right part of the goal. Stanley was able to get a hand on it, but the ball still found a way to the net for Ponce’s second goal of the game and 10th of the season, giving the Wildcats a 3-2 win.
“Everybody was kind of panicking. It was inside shooting range, but we wanted to stay calm and focus on the little things, like following our marks and staying touch-tied and talking to each other. It was an unfortunate call and a great finish,” Carrillo said.
USC outshot Arizona 23-10 for the game, with both teams getting 7 on goal. In a game with questionable calls going against both sides, USC committed 10 fouls to Arizona’s 6, but won the corner kick advantage 7-4.
“We had enough chances, we had enough opportunities,” USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We made some critical mistakes that they were able to capitalize on. You have to give them credit for what they did today, but I’m not real pleased with the outcome.”
The Women of Troy will look to bounce back on the road next weekend as they head to Boulder to take on Colorado (11-3-1, 3-2-1 Pac-12) on Friday, Oct. 25 at 1 p.m., followed by a trip to Salt Lake City to face Utah (7-3-5, 3-2-1 Pac-12) on Sunday, Oct. 27 at 12 p.m.

A different venue and a fresh divisional opponent once again proved to be just another speed bump for the USC women’s volleyball team, which is stringing together win after win in dominating fashion.
Femme fatale · Junior Hannah Schraer (center) had 10 kills in the Women of Troy’s victory over the ASU Sun Devils in Tempe, Ariz. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The American Volleyball Coaches’ Association No. 1-ranked Women of Troy traveled to the desert this week and made quick work of rival Arizona State, beating the Sun Devils 3-0 Friday night (25-17, 25-20, 25-15) to improve to 17-1 and match the 2006 squad for the best season-opening start in school history.
“It was a great win for us on our second week on the road,” USC head coach Mick Haley said. “Arizona State has had success against us and they’ve beaten us twice in the last three years at their place, so it was a good challenge for us. I thought we did a marvelous job of not letting them get the crowd into it.”
Junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer provided the Women of Troy a huge lift, notching 10 kills while hitting an outstanding .769 to pace a strong USC attack. Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio also added 10 kills and rode her strong serve to five more service aces, marking the eighth time this season she has recorded at least three aces in a match. Defensively, senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard and freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu combined for 14 blocks, while senior libero Natalie Hagglund led all players with 10 digs.
“It was a team effort. Some of the numbers weren’t good for some people, but that doesn’t tell the story in this match,” Haley said. “Nwanebu didn’t have great numbers but dominated on the right side. Bricio was really focused and on her game, and her serve was just stunning.”
After taking a 13-11 lead in the first set, USC pulled away and went up 21-14 on a Bricio ace. Olgard notched a kill to bring up set point at 24-17 before causing an ASU error that sealed the first set 25-17 for the visitors. The Women of Troy recorded 12 kills and a .375 hitting percentage in the first set while holding ASU to just .111 on offense.
The second set saw ASU take a 16-14 lead before USC applied the pressure to take the lead. Bricio tied things up at 16, and Nwanebu and Schraer blocked back-to-back shots for a 19-17 lead. Another USC block brought up match point at 24-20 after which the Sun Devils committed an error to conclude the set at 25-20.
As has been the norm this season, the Women of Troy made the last set their easiest, winning handily by 10 points. A Schraer kill put USC up 20-10 and freshman setter Alice Pizzasegola set up Olgard for a final kill that sealed the frame 25-15 and pushed USC to 7-0 in Pac-12 play.
“Arizona State was a little predictable and we executed our game plan amazingly well,” Haley said. “We’ll have a more difficult time defending against Arizona because they’re a better blocking team and they’ll try to take our setters out. We need to make sure that we’re focused and continue to execute our game plan on the road.”
The Women of Troy will conclude their four-game road trip against the Arizona Wildcats Sunday afternoon before returning home to play Washington and Washington State next weekend.

The team did the second “el foldo” of the season vs. Arizona on Sunday. Getting swept is not the sign of a #1
team in the country. You lose the first set in overtime is tough, but a top squad needs to focus and regroup.
Overcoming adversity is a key element especially needed when the playoffs happen in a regional. One decent
win over Purdue in non-conference matches, and a home victory over Stanford is basically all they have to show
on their resume so far. Washington at home on Sunday will be another test to their ability.

Up until Saturday’s matchup against Notre Dame, the Ed Orgeron era at USC had been all about fun, smiles and desserts.
But after watching the Trojans repeatedly shoot themselves in the foot in the final minutes to hand the game to one of their biggest rivals, it was hard for any member of the Trojan faithful to stay positive.
Even with “Darth Visor” no longer roaming the USC sideline, questionable coaching decisions and stagnant offensive play down the stretch hamstrung the Trojans as they suffered a 14-10 loss that was tough to watch for most of the second half.
Orgeron kept up an upbeat demeanor after the game, smiling at each reporter who asked him a question in the post-game press conference. He was questioned about everything from his fourth-down playcall to his confidence in junior kicker Andre Heidari, who missed two field goals that ended up being the difference in the game.
“He’s been good for us,” Orgeron said of the kicker, who is now 6 of 11 on the season, and 2 of 7 on kicks longer than 30 yards.
It was hard to watch Heidari on Saturday night and come to the same conclusion; Heidari’s 46-yard attempt in the fourth quarter fell well short of the uprights, and he’s never resembled the same player that made 15 of 17 attempts his freshman year since suffering a knee injury early last season.
But it’s obviously not fair to fault the kicker for what unfolded Saturday night — there’s plenty of blame to go around.
Senior running back Silas Redd spent the first half ripping Notre Dame’s defense for 91 yards on 14 carries, arguably playing the best half of his USC career. Yet he only received two touches in the painfully slow third quarter, when both teams combined for just 57 yards. Where was USC’s most consistent offensive contributor during this snoozefest?
USC averaged just 2.1 yards per play in the third quarter — did it not cross the mind of offensive coordinator Clay Helton to hand the ball off to the player who had just averaged 6.5 yards per carry in the first half?
Now, some would criticize Orgeron for electing to go for it on 4th and 20 with three minutes left instead of taking the field goal on what would turn out to be USC’s second-to-last possession. But I find it hard to argue with that decision since there was no guarantee USC would be getting the ball back. And as Orgeron astutely observed after the game, “We weren’t kicking field goals very well.”
What really hurt USC’s chances the most was the offensive line’s frustrating penchant for penalties.
With both offenses slogging, USC decided to go for it on 4th and 6 from Notre Dame’s 29-yard line on the last play of the third quarter. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler appeared to pick up the first down on a scramble, but a holding call on junior right guard Aundrey Walker canceled out the pickup and forced a punt.
When faced with nearly the same exact situation on their next drive — 4th and 5 on the Notre Dame 29-yard line — the Trojans elected for a field goal, and Heidari’s 46-yard try fell short.
That first penalty on Walker was certainly maddening, but not nearly as devastating as the subsequent holding call on him that negated another run by Kessler inside Notre Dame’s 5-yard line with less than four minutes remaining in the game. Instead of having a first and goal opportunity, the Trojans were instead faced with 3rd and 22 from the 33-yard line.
That drive ended with a false start by redshirt freshman left tackle Chad Wheeler and a sack. All in all, the offensive line had accounted for 25 penalty yards (sophomore left guard Max Tuerk also was flagged for holding earlier in the drive), essentially negating the 28 yards Kessler and the offense had managed to scrape together when they weren’t penalized. The Trojans netted only three yards while taking 3:38 off the clock, ruining their own chances to escape with a win.
The mistake-laden performance wasted a superb effort from USC’s defense that allowed only 47 yards in the second half.
“We were killing ourselves with penalties and missed assignments,” Kessler said. “If you can’t convert on third down and keep drives going you can’t really win a game.”
The fact that USC even got two possessions near the end with a chance to win seemed like a miracle in itself. After a rush by Notre Dame backup quarterback Andrew Hendrix with seven minutes remaining, in which he picked up the first third-down conversion by either team since the first quarter, the game seemed destined to end without any more threats from the Trojans.
That proved untrue, as freshman safety Su’a Cravens’ fumble recovery gave USC another chance. But the Trojans failed to capitalize on the opportunities as they had the rest of the night — and most of this season.

I have seen some weird football games but USC-Notre Dame, 2013, could be made into a slow-motion, trick-photography movie that would have to be fiction all the way.  How else could you explain away the endless opportunities, as Notre Dame kept waiting and waiting for us to beat them?  Thank you, Notre Dame, but, our magnificent defense notwithstanding, we had losing on our mind.

The No. 1-ranked USC men’s water polo team extended their current home winning steak to 43 games after blowing by No. 13-ranked Loyola Marymount, 17-4, and unranked Cal Lutheran, 22-3, at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Saturday.
Back on top · After gaining the No. 1 ranking in the nation with the win over UCLA last week at the SoCal Tournament, the Trojans extended their home winning streak to 43 games with two wins this weekend. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
 
USC (19-1) tacked the pair of wins onto its current overall winning streak, bringing the tally to nine games.
This comes just a week after the Trojans defeated crosstown rival UCLA 12-11 (OT) in a dramatic, come-from-behind fashion at the championship game of the SoCal Tournament. By doing so, USC reclaimed its coveted top ranking, while the Bruins dropped to No. 2.
Another milestone also occurred for a USC player on Saturday as junior driver Kostas Genidounias broke into USC’s all-time top-10 scoring list with his two goals against LMU. He would finish the day tied for No. 8 all-time. Senior driver Nikola Vavic also continues to add to his own new all-time scoring record. Vavic had five goals on the day.
“I’m satisfied with today’s wins,” Genidounias said. “We actually stayed to our plan and didn’t allow a lot of goals on defense, while our offense just came by itself.”
The Trojans would take some time to get going against LMU (10-10), who trailed USC by only one goal 3-2 after a Lions player netted a buzzer beater from half tank.
Like so many times before, USC would come alive in the second frame with redshirt junior utility Ivan Kustic and senior two-meter Connor Virjee bringing the Trojans to a 6-2 lead. LMU’s Milutin Mitrovic would cut the lead to 6-3, but the Trojans would come back with five goals unanswered to take an 11-3 lead into the third frame. In the final frame, they shut out the Lions and racked up six more scores to round out the game.
Being able to shut down their opponents is a result of head coach Jovan Vavic’s recently implemented pressure defense.
“We’re working on pressing a lot and not letting opposing offenses to have time to do what they want,” said redshirt junior driver Rex Butler.
Butler had a hat trick, while six other players had two goals. Senior goalie James Clark finished the match with nine saves.
The theme of the day for the Trojans was “spreading the love,” as 13 different USC players made up their 22 goals against Cal Lutheran (8-13), while 15 different players scored between the two games.
“It was a fun day overall since everyone got to score and some guys even got their first career goals or played for the first time,” said redshirt sophomore two-meter Chase Watson.
Following a short break, the team continued its scoring run against the Kingsmen by tallying double-digit goals in the first frame with 10 goals.
A plethora of players would have multi-goal games led by Watson, who had four. Vavic scored three, and senior two-meter Jeremy Davie, freshman driver Nick Bell, Virjee and junior driver Marc Vonderweidt would all add two goals of their own. Redshirt freshman driver Liam Burke would score his first career goal in the Trojan effort.
USC will head up to Santa Barbara and jump into more Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play next Sunday, Oct. 27, against UC Santa Barbara. Game time is set for 12 p.m.

The Trojans lost a nail-biter under the lights at Notre Dame Stadium 14-10 on Saturday night, as a USC team decimated by injuries at just about every offensive skill position failed to score in the second half.
The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for the Trojans in South Bend, where they hadn’t lost since 2001. USC hadn’t lost any nonconference road game since 2002, and hadn’t lost twice in a row to Notre Dame since 2000-2001.

USC had ample opportunities to overcome the deficit in the final period as the defense also held Notre Dame scoreless in the second half, but a litany of injuries, self-destructive play from the offensive line and a couple missed field goals doomed the Trojans.
“Well, we have a hurt team in there,” interim head coach Ed Orgeron said. “Unfortunately we didn’t win the game, but I really liked the way our guys played and competed to the end.”
Freshman safety Su’a Cravens gave USC the ball at the Irish 34-yard line by recovering a fumble –— Notre Dame’s only turnover of the night — with 6:27 left. A perfectly targeted 16-yard pass to freshman wideout Darreus Rogers from redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler picked up a first down at the Irish 21-yard line, and the Trojans looked primed to come away with at least a field goal.
But on a play where Kessler scrambled to inside the 5-yard line, a holding penalty on junior right guard Aundrey Walker brought the ball back to the 33-yard line.
“It wasn’t a hold,” Walker said. “But the ref called it and we gotta live with it and move on … It happened so fast, I was holding my hands up because I thought it was gonna be a touchdown. And I turned around and there was a flag on the field.”
A false start by redshirt freshman left tackle Chad Wheeler dug the Trojans into a 4th and 20 situation on Notre Dame’s 26-yard line, meaning a field goal attempt would have been 43 yards long. With time running down and junior kicker Andre Heidari already having missed two field goals from 40 and 46 yards out, the Trojans tried to go for the touchdown and the win. But Kessler was sacked to turn the ball over on downs.
“Going into the end, we just felt that we weren’t kicking field goals very well so [we thought], ‘Let’s go and win the game,’” Orgeron said.
USC had another chance to score after a defensive stop, but injuries to Rogers, junior wideout Marqise Lee, freshman tailback Justin Davis and redshirt junior tight end Randall Telfer forced the Trojans to stretch deep into their depth chart on the final drive — and the backups’ inexperience showed. Sophomore tight end Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick and walk-on redshirt freshman wide receiver Robby Kolanz lined up for USC, and a false start by Cope-Fitzpatrick and two incompletions thrown to the third-string tight end killed the Trojans’ last-gasp attempt to score.
“Obviously the penalties hurt us tonight in crucial situations, and we didn’t punch it in in the red zone when we need to,” Orgeron said. “It seemed that every time we had a first down or something like that, we had a holding call or jumped offsides, shot ourselves in the foot, and then it was 2nd and 20.”
Overall, the Trojans’ offensive stats looked passable; Kessler completed 20 of 34 passes for 201 yards and senior running back Silas Redd rushed 19 times for 112 yards and a touchdown.
But after USC’s first drive of the game resulted in a touchdown, the Trojans never found the end zone again, and ended the game with a streak of 11 consecutive failed third-down attempts.
“We felt like we had that game won until there were four zeros on the clock, ‘til it was completely over,” redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey said. “[Notre Dame] just made a couple more plays at the end that affected the outcome.”
The Trojans had been expected to mostly split carries between the healthy quartet of backs who had registered carries against Arizona last week after redshirt sophomore Tre Madden suffered a hamstring injury. Madden wasn’t active for USC on Saturday, but Redd was slated for his first start of the season and seemed determined to assert himself as the starter.
The senior carried six times for 40 yards on USC’s opening drive and punched the ball in for a one-yard touchdown to give the Trojans a 7-0 lead.
The Irish attacked through the air on the next drive, as quarterback Tommy Rees completed six of seven attempts for 49 yards to lead Notre Dame to pay dirt. The drive concluded with a seven-yard pass to tight end Troy Niklas that tied up the game and put Rees over the 6,000 passing yard mark for his career, becoming only the fifth Notre Dame quarterback to surpass that mark. Rees finished 14 of 21 for 166 yards and two touchdowns.
Notre Dame’s offense took a huge hit — literally and figuratively — when junior linebacker Lamar Dawson burst untouched on a blitz early in the third quarter and unloaded on Rees, knocking him out of the game with a neck strain.
The Irish’s offense was noticeably more conservative from that point onward, as backup quarterback Andrew Hendrix short-armed several throws while failing to complete any of his four attempts. In fact, the Irish didn’t complete any passes in the fourth quarter, a stunning feat for a team to pull off while also claiming victory.
“I wasn’t willing to throw the football, and when we did, I didn’t like the way it looked,” Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said. “Obviously we missed [Rees] in the second half … We tried to have [Hendrix] pull [the ball] and get to the sidelines, but it was tough sledding out there.”
A 48-yard punt return from sophomore wideout Nelson Agholor, the longest by a Trojan since 2010, gave USC the ball at the Notre Dame 20-yard line with just under 10 minutes left in the second quarter. The Trojans failed to reach the end zone, but Heidari was true on his second field-goal attempt from 22 yards out to give the Trojans a 10-7 lead.
After the teams traded scoreless possessions, the Irish finally gained some traction in the run game on their last drive of the half, and it resulted in their first halftime lead in the rivalry at their home field since 2005.
Notre Dame tailback Cam McDaniel broke off a 24-yard run to the Irish 41-yard line before a blatant pass interference penalty by redshirt junior cornerback Anthony Brown moved the ball past midfield to the USC 47.
McDaniel followed with the longest rush of his career, a 36-yard scamper down to the USC 11-yard line, and receiver TJ Jones hauled in an impressive touchdown catch over sophomore cornerback Kevon Seymour to give the Irish a 14-10 lead that held until the final whistle.

I don’t think any of the commenters, nor the author of this article watched this game. USC DID NOT SELF-DESTRUCT against ND. ND was not that much better than USC. If they were, then why wasn’t the rout margin larger? USC didn’t lose the game as much as the officiating crew’s blatant anti-USC/anti-PAC-12/anti-any western conference bias did. You can’t beat ND AND the officiating crew!
There were soooooooooo many holding calls that weren’t called during the game against USC, they are lucky their QB isn’t in the hospital today.
Trojans, we’re in for another Tollner/Hackett spell. At least there’s NFL.
Sorry, Aundrey.  Your hold was actually one of the most blatant infractions of the night and it was caught on tape for the world to see.  It allowed Kessler to break contain and almost turned the ND defender around.  Didn’t the NCAA teach you anything?  STOP CHEATING!  That is all.
Great one sided article. ND was missing 8 of their two deep defensive roster as well. Nd was missing their QB for all but 3 minutes of te second half. There was one bad hold call, otherwise tey were all very valid and very impactful. Take the medicine.
The Irish D was simply the better D and the best defense USC has seen. The good thing is that now USC’s defense knows what a real one looks like. More importantly, USC’s offensive line knows that they have a ton of work to do because they were the weakest unit Notre Dame has faced, that includes Temple’s O line.
Two coaches for the offensive line, and this is the result you get in crucial times of a game. Team scores one
field goal in the last 50 minutes after their only TD. Some irrational play calling by Helton who is really no better
than Kiffin. He needs to be in the booth upstairs to get a different look of the opposing defense to make some
adjustments for the next play if warranted. Pendergast is so over rated being the secondary coach.
Any bad call last night still doesn’t make up for the missed Bush Push call  in ’05 that cost Quinn the Heisman and ND a shot at the title.

We’re going to take a little break from the traditional weekly playlists to explore an important topic: music purchases.
Back in my middle school days, when I filled my iTunes library with numerous Fall Out Boy singles, the concept of paying for online music simply did not exist. Why in the world would I do such a thing when I had easy access to torrents, the infamous  YouTube-to-MP3 tactic and other questionable peer-to-peer websites. The options to procure music without paying a single penny were endless.
But then, around the age of 12, friends and family finally began to replace my sparkly Limited Too gift cards with iTunes ones. It was at this point that I realized buying music was actually a good idea.
Unfortunately, this newfound duty to buy my music also created a quandary. I could no longer go on sprees where I would download every Jesse McCartney and Britney Spears track that I desired. So, I devised a strategy to continue keeping my library stocked. I purchased the songs and albums of the lesser-known musicians, unsigned and most likely living off of ramen noodles in an effort to support their endeavors. I torrented big names, such as Beyoncé and Pitbull, whose songs received plenty of airtime, and justifying this method by telling myself Beyoncé probably bathed in goat’s milk, anyway. So what difference would my dollar make?
But that’s where I was wrong. My dollar did make a difference, regardless of how rich and famous the people behind the songs I loved were. My dollar paid homage to the industry as a whole, which has consistently uplifted, entertained and inspired me. It was my moral responsibility, I eventually decided, to support this industry in its entirety.
So soon enough, I stopped my petty torrenting and started purchasing every song. I didn’t waver from this stance, even when iTunes increased its prices from 99 cents to an irritating $1.29 per track back in 2009. I still saw immense value in purchasing my music. The sound quality was clearly superior to the often pitchy and slightly distorted illegally downloaded tracks.
Furthermore, I no longer had to add album titles and tags with a sense of guilt.
It was all there, beautiful album covers included, the very moment after I clicked “buy song.”
These days, I cough up a solid $9.99 a month for Spotify, a premium music subscription service based in Stockholm, Sweden. Founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzo sought to blend elements of Internet radio and social networking into one platform. Their product immediately made waves, and by December 2012, they had more than 5 million paid subscribers.
The benefits to Spotify are endless. But before I delve into the perks of music subscription, let me clarify that I’m not a paid Spotify ambassador. I speak purely from experience.
Where streaming services such as Pandora and Grooveshark fail, Spotify succeeds. Spotify provides access to more than 20 million songs; and this number constantly updates as artists release new albums.
Though Spotify has come under fire for the way in which it pays its artists, its executives continue to ardently support their business model.
“People need to transition from unit-based thinking to consumption-based thinking in terms of royalties. We feel the metric of success should be based on how many people are listening to your music over a period of years, as opposed to looking at how many units are shipping in one week,” D.A. Wallach, Spotify’s “Artist in Residence” told Hypebot. “People are used to seeing big numbers from a               unit-based model, but that’s really front loading what is happening … The bottom line for us is that we have paid out nearly $200 million in royalties and we feel we are making a real contribution back to the music business.”
The most creative feature of Spotify, arguably, is the ability to “follow” your friends. Once you follow a peer, the tracks they are currently playing will start to scroll in an activity sidebar. Though it’s a little creepy that you can tell when your friends are studying as opposed to partying, it’s yet another fun way to discover new artists.
The advent of services such as Spotify has also signaled the death of thoughtful mixtapes and burned CDs. It’s easier than ever before to hastily put together a playlist to send to a friend or loved one via the web.
If you’re not prepared to pay for your music just yet, try the free version of Spotify. A fair warning: Your homework grind will most likely be interrupted by obnoxious commercials. But something has to pay the bills, right?
So regardless of what you choose — iTunes or subscription services — there’s an affordable way to enjoy music legally.
Here’s to you, Beyoncé — keep on moving and shaking, because you have a loyal fan in both my wallet and me.

After finishing a tour with Relient K in May, Hellogoodbye continues to promote their new wave indie-pop music on the North American leg of Paramore’s tour. Despite a calm Saturday night at the Honda Center, Hellogoodbye and Paramore took Anaheim by storm. With bright flashing lights, heavy bass, blazing instruments and passionate vocals, both bands knew how to fire up a Saturday night crowd.

An enormous line snaked around all four corners of the arena long before doors opened, yet the Honda Center was only half full when Hellogoodbye began to perform. The band treated fans to a couple of new songs from their highly anticipated third studio album, Everything is Debatable, which drops on Oct. 29. Dressed in dapper outfits, they opened up Paramore’s Self-Titled concert with a surprisingly short set of only six songs. With only a few songs, however, Hellogoodbye guided the crowd through a tour of emotions, mirroring Hellogoodbye’s transition from their old style synthpop to new wave indie-pop. “Here (In Your Arms)” hit the crowd with a wave of nostalgia while “Swear You’re In Love” lulled the crowd to sway side to side with strangers in their row.
For “Here (In Your Arms),” bassist Augustine Rampolla amped up the bass, creating a slight dubstep remix to the popular middle school anthem. There’s no denying the musical talent of Hellogoodbye. The light touch of Forrest Kline on his keyboard created a rain of piano notes that caused a ripple effect in the crowd as the mosh pit waved their hands in the air, increasing outward incrementally until the very top of the arena was waving to the beat of “Magic Hour.”
During their slower, more romantic songs, such as “Swear You’re In Love,” lead singer Kline caressed his mic as if it were the inspiration for pouring his love letters into music. Hellogoodbye celebrated their transformation into the new age by combining popular indie influences and quirky but gentle lyrics into a perfect harmony.
Though the crowd was unfamiliar with most of Hellogoodbye’s new music, it seemed to try to catch up to the band’s level of energy. Even though he leapt around the stage while yelling chorus lines as if he was summoning Freddie Mercury, Kline’s lack of dialogue created distance. Aside from the occasional “thanks,” Kline was all business, racing through an already quick set of songs. At times, it felt as if Kline was married to his mic, standing still, placing too much focus on the mosh pit while forgetting the crowds on the sides.
Unfortunately, Hellogoodbye’s overuse of bass in their final two songs did not spark a renewed exhilaration in the crowd. Most of Hellogoodbye’s vocal and instrumental talent was wasted on a tidal wave of bass that left the crowd slightly confused since it did not match the rock ‘n’ roll feel of the concert. Indeed, Hellogoodbye’s opening performance put their newest album to the test. The issue of whether or not Hellogoodbye was able to attract potential fans or if their opening act was successful is much like their newest song, “(Everything is) Debatable.” Overall, Hellogoodbye was the tiny spark that set the crowd ablaze and prepared them for Paramore’s performance. Short but sweet, their act was as fleeting as their name.
Following Metric, the concert’s second opening band, it was time for the headliner to shine. After an hour and a half of opening acts, the mysterious flapping black curtains finally dropped, unveiling the night’s main attraction: Paramore. Lead singer Hayley Williams, running and waving to each part of the crowd, reenergized the audience, anxious from waiting for an hour and a half.
While concertgoers attempted to adjust to Paramore’s sudden appearance, Williams took charge and maintained the pandemonium with a simple bow and a wave of her hand. Immediately, she breathlessly sang “Grow Up,” which was muddled by the loud cheering from an ecstatic crowd. Paramore’s performance invigorated the arena as if it were sold out. Though only three-fourths of the seats were occupied, the arena’s reverberated energy filled up all of the empty space left by a drop off of fans caused by Paramore’s initial split.
Once the band started “That’s What You Get,” the crowd unleashed any remaining repressed energy. The alternative rock band was in San Jose just the day before, but they displayed no signs of being tired as they effortlessly powered through six songs. In spite of the lack of catchiness in their new songs compared to old fan favorites such as “Decode” and “crushcrushcrush,” Paramore displayed an entertaining variety of spirit consistent of head bangs and playful exchanges. The band’s dynamic worked well together.
Paramore catered to both new and old fans by revisiting songs from their most successful album, Riot! while promoting their new album which fell off the top charts within two weeks of its debut. Songs such as “Daydreaming,” which was hard to sell on their album, rocked out live as Williams painted the plain stock filler song with her strong vibrato. Likewise, fellow band members Jeremy Davis and Taylor York coated the lyrics with golden backup vocals and colorful guitar and bass notes.
Throughout “Last Hope,” Paramore sang with inspiration. Regardless of the song’s repetitive lyrics, the power from Williams’ heartfelt singing transformed the song into a testimony so moving that the crowd cheering became a single voice yelling “preach” when Williams finished. This trend continued into “Ain’t It Fun,” when the band brought out the gospel choir straight from the recording studio to sing on stage, converting the Honda Center into a gospel church. While the band and gospel choir exchanged hugs, the sea of pumped up fists dyed cerulean by the lights applauded the performers for their hard work.
Another testament of fan loyalty occurred at the start of “The Only Exception.” Waves of sentimentality washed over Paramore when the dark arena was lit by an ocean of stars created by swaying camera flashes.
At the end of the night, fans left the arena with both hands swinging in the air while singing the infectious lyrics to “Still Into You” as they walked to their cars, proving that this concert was worth the wait since their last concert at the Honda Center a few years ago.

Steve McQueen’s 12 Years a Slave is a film about slavery unlike any we have seen before. In contrast to the giddy violence of Django Unchained, 12 Years shows a brutal image of a stain on our history, with acts so horrific that the film is both stunning and incredibly difficult to watch.
Emotion unchained · Chiwetel Ejiofor (center) gives a riveting performance in 12 Years a Slave as Solomon Northup, a free man from the North abducted and sold into slavery in the 19th century. – Photo Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures
McQueen’s previous two films, Hunger and Shame, were unblinking examinations of a hunger strike and sex addiction, respectively. They were relentless movies, expertly honed to recreate the feelings of despair and helplessness that the protagonists (both played by Michael Fassbender) respectively felt.
In 12 Years, McQueen adapts the true story of Solomon Northup’s kidnapping from his life as a free man in New York and his eventual enslavement in Louisiana. The result is a sledgehammer of a movie. McQueen’s ability to craft a visceral portrayal of his protagonists’ experiences combined with the sheer brutality and hopelessness of the life of a slave in 1840s Louisiana results in a film that has an emotional impact stronger than any film released in a long time.
The movie does not shy away from its depictions of slavery’s horrors. It would be preposterous to say that the film “made you feel” the pain depicted on the screen because of the sheer volume of pain, both emotional and physical, involved. But the way the scenes were shot does strike viewers to the core.
From the moment when Northup, brilliantly played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, wakes up and sees he is in chains, the pain doesn’t stop. The first beating he suffers is jarring. Beaten with a wooden bat, the camera focuses on the faces of Northup and his tormenter in turn, showing both the intense pain and manic sadism present in every swing of the bat against Northup’s back. Any ideas of escape or resistance are promptly beaten out of him and every other person sharing his predicament. No film has stared so directly at slavery’s ugliness. Like Schindler’s List 20 years ago, this film takes on a subject that has already been condemned in films and shows the inhumanity that had been implied but never laid bare. The way 12 Years a Slave captures the sheer terror of slavery in detail puts it in a class with Schindler’s List. It is not only a great film, but also a vastly important one. In one particular way, this film manages to surpass Schindler ’s impact.
Like Schindler’s, this film actually focuses on the life of a particular man. Unlike that film, however, the man in 12 Years is actually undergoing the horror of the situation, rather than trying to fight against it. Ejiofor gives a powerhouse performance and reveals a talent hidden from the audience in his supporting roles in great films such as Children of Men, Inside Man and Serenity. His silent defiance and struggle against despair is awe-inspiring but never over the top. He is right at home as the leading man in a role that must have been harrowing to perform.
Fassbender, a constant favorite of McQueen’s, plays the worst plantation owner in the film, and his performance is equally breathtaking. He plays a man that is fundamentally wrong in what he believes, but he never becomes a caricature of evil — he is simply a man embroiled in the beliefs and rhetoric of the surroundings he lives in while also battling the demon of alcoholism. It is not hard to imagine Ejiofor and Fassbender sweeping the male acting Academy Awards this year for their performances.
The rest of the cast is littered with familiar faces from film and television. Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Sarah Paulson, Brad Pitt, Mad Men’s Bryan Batt, Saturday Night Live’s Taran Killam and The Wire’s Michael K. Williams all play roles of varying nature. It shows just how important this film is to these people as many of them took on very small supporting roles, despite their larger profiles (this recalls last year’s Lincoln, which was similarly riddled with notable actors in minor roles).
If anything was annoying about the film, however, it was how some of these casting choices could distract the viewer from the power of the film. But honestly, that is the only problem. The film is amazing and traumatic, and if it doesn’t win Best Picture at the Oscars, there is something seriously wrong. No other film this year, for quite a few years really, is as emotionally charged or tragic as 12 Years a Slave. It’s a wonderful work of art as it is a historically important film. While other films coming out this year are sure to be great, this film should transcend other films from this year. It is a heartbreaking must-watch that should be considered a classic for years to come.

M.I.A., the stage name of Sri Lankan/British musical artist Maya Arulpragasam, is no stranger to controversy. From themes of violence, political revolution and poverty in her songs to her controversial music video for the song “Born Free,” which was banned from YouTube for depicting  police brutality, M.I.A. has shocked her fair share of listeners. Her most-criticized stunt, however, was flipping the camera off during the halftime show at the 2012 Super Bowl during a performance with Madonna and Nicki Minaj. In late September, M.I.A. was sued by the National Football League for the incident, according to Fox Sports.
The Federal Communications Commission chose not to pursue a lawsuit, but the NFL decided to sue her for $1.5 million “for damages” under the assertion that M.I.A. violated the “tremendous public respect and reputation for wholesomeness enjoyed by the NFL.” Though M.I.A. pushed the envelope with her on-air gesture, she should not be penalized in such an excessive and arbitrary way since the FCC deemed her stunt undeserving of punishment, and because the NFL is notoriously shaky on their depiction of “wholesomeness.”
The internet has also widely documented a new video put out by M.I.A., in which she responds to the NFL’s actions against her. She describes the freeze frame where she flips the camera off during her performance of “Give Me All Your Luvin’” with Madonna and Minaj.
“There are … 10, 15 cheerleaders … that Madonna got from a local high school … all under sixteen. They’re wearing cheerleader outfits, legs thrusted in the air, legs wide open, in a sexually provocative position,” M.I.A. said. “Is my finger offensive, or is an underage black girl with her legs wide open more offensive to the family audience? … [They want me] to say it’s [more] ok to promote being sexually exploited as a female than to display female empowerment through being punk rock.”
M.I.A. is pointing out a problematic trend in the NFL and mainstream media. The fact that the dancers for this production were underage is even more disturbing. It’s not surprising, then, that the machismo-ridden constituents of the NFL would be up in arms over M.I.A.’s finger, which in her words was an expression of female power — essentially, the anti-“eye candy.” In theory, a simple finger should not affect the family audience as strongly as the NFL contends, considering that today’s youth is exposed to so much crude material that the middle finger now seems tame.
M.I.A.’s lawyer has released a similar statement expressing skepticism over the NFL’s emphasis on “wholesomeness,” which he considers paradoxical. He told The Hollywood Reporter that “the NFL’s claimed reputation for wholesomeness is hilarious, in light of the weekly felonies committed by its stars, the bounties placed by coaches on opposing players, the homophobic and racist comments uttered by its players, the complete disregard for the health of players … and the raping of public entities ready to sacrifice public funds to attract teams.”
The NFL’s double standards do not end there. M.I.A. tweeted a video of Tennessee Titans owner Bud Adams giving the finger at a game — with both hands, and for several seconds — with the caption, “is it ok when it come[s] from him?”
From over-sexualized cheerleaders, to players’ occasional bouts of substance abuse, such as in the case of Josh Freeman of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, to sexual assault as demonstrated by Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the NFL is not exactly the epitome of family-friendly entertainment.
There doesn’t appear to be much for the NFL to protect from M.I.A. Suing her for $1.5 million only further demonizes the league. M.I.A. has not been the only artist to grace the Super Bowl stage with a faux pas. Kid Rock emerged during halftime wearing a torn American flag as a poncho, Nelly gave viewers an eyeful of his crotch-grabbing and most notably, Janet Jackson had a “wardrobe malfunction” — though accidental — that was deemed most explicit of all by FCC standards. Jackson received a fine of $550,000, which was miniscule in comparison to the NFL’s claim against M.I.A.’s, but walked away scot-free after the court dropped the fine. It is not the fact that Jackson was more deserving of discipline than M.I.A., but that her blunder, nicknamed “Nipplegate,” caused more of a media pandemonium that makes the charges levied against M.I.A. look capricious.
All in all, the FCC is the ultimate authority on acceptable television content. It is unreasonable that the NFL would warrant an exorbitant $1.5 million “for damages” for M.I.A.’s millisecond-long finger shot, while the FCC itself, in addition to NBC,  which aired the Superbowl, decided to drop the affair. Summing up the incident in her video, M.I.A. said, “it’s a massive waste of time, a massive waste of money and it’s a massive display of powerful corporation d—ck shaking.”
No one could possibly put it better.

Over the last five years, Tea Party members and deficit hawks in the United States Congress have used European nations embroiled in sovereign debt crises as examples of unsustainable levels of deficit spending. The Eurozone, a region of 17 European member states united by a common currency, the euro, nearly collapsed because a handful of countries had debt levels exceeding 100 percent of the GDP, meaning their debt was worth more than all the economic activity in their nations in a year.
Victoria Cuthbertson | Daily Trojan
The idea of keeping debt below that level in terms of national output became a goal for the United States, and by extension a necessity for world economic security.
With the recently averted government default, the issue of American debt is back on the table.
The Heritage Foundation, one of the most conservative think tanks for U.S. policy, argued this summer that high debt is a real problem facing this country, simply based on the idea that debt, as an entity, is a problem. Following this logic, the United States must be headed toward serious economic collapse simply because U.S. debt exists.
Unfortunately, the analysis of Heritage and other conservative thinkers is misguided. Debt helps nations grow by bringing liquidity to markets and helps finance social programs that benefit people, creating better health and education in a state, which allows workers to find better jobs requiring an educated workforce. Furthermore, when countries are experiencing inflation, as the United States has been for decades, borrowing becomes cheaper. Borrowing money during inflationary periods reduces the cost of borrowing and allows greater liquidity in the markets. Besides, since the U.S. government is considered a near rock-solid investment by ratings agencies such as Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s, the cost of borrowing for the United States remains low. The United States has many advantages in borrowing money as the biggest economy in the world. Because of this, comparisons between countries such as Greece and the United States are simply not useful.
The reason that debt became a problem for countries such as Greece is because those countries took on too much debt relative to their position in the world economy. The United States isn’t even close to reaching an upper limit on its borrowing capability. Granted, if the United States does do this, the world will face serious economic consequences, but debt at this stage is not as big of a problem as the Tea Party believes.
The only apt comparison for the U.S. economy is the Japanese economy. Japan’s level of debt is currently greater than 200 percent of the GDP, but 10-year bond rates remain low, meaning that investors are still willing to put money into Japan. Japan is now facing some trouble because servicing the debt requires so much money every year, according to the Economist. Japan has yet to face serious economic consequences as a result of high levels of debt.
The situation is better in the United States than it is in Japan. Treasury bond rates are at extreme lows, and even lower now that the United States has backed away from a government shutdown and default, according to NPR. Like Japan, the United States continues to have high levels of investor confidence, meaning low interest rates on bonds. Essentially, the U.S. debt costs almost nothing at current interest rates, so there is not much incentive to lower borrowing, especially if that would stifle growth.
The only time that U.S. debt might become a problem for the United States, and by extension the world, is if consumer confidence begins to fade and the United States needs to increase treasury bond yields to compensate for the drop in demand. Fortunately, as the Council on Foreign Relations reported recently, demand for U.S. bonds is still high, and rates are still low. There is no reason to panic at this point.
At this time, a better course of action is for the United States to continue to borrow money to finance daily government functions and create growth. The United States and the world are just beginning to emerge from the repeated financial disasters of the last half decade, and given the United States’ place in the world, it is better for the United States to grow before addressing a domestic debt problem. Wait for some serious economic recovery before tackling the debt issue — this is not anywhere close to a crisis.

What you have failed to understand is the relationship of the purchasing value of the dollar as compared to the amount of debt incurrd. You state the C f r finds no problem with incurring debt, but that is a typical response from the CFfR, one of the prominent, progressive liberal think tanks. The CFR os wrong on this one.
Under the current president, this country’s debt has tripled and the Dems in the Senate, namely. Harry Reid, has stated that they will continue to spend. Hogwash.  The purchasing value of the dollar has dropped considerably over the past 6 years, and more so since the late 70’s. In order to pay for this debt, the federal reserve has to print more money, and by doing so, dilutes the dollar and confidence in our monetary system.
You probably don’t undetstand the real world of financeand politics, because you’r a young man starting out in the world, away from home, and perhaps have a nice little job to have some exa money.
Until you are fully on your own, making your own money, having to save for a home, a nice car, and living on you own paycheck, You will not understand.
If you think the Democrat’s irresponsible spending habits can be sustainable, you’re not thinking this through. Under the current trends, you and your grneration will be saddled with so much debt, you will be taxed at extremely higher tax rates than today. It will not be unusal for you to be paying taxes upwards oft 70 percent in 15 yrs, if you and your generation don’t intervene and lobby your congresional representative and Senators to stop the madness.
Enjoy your college llife, study hard, take the classes that will help you to be a success in whatever you do, because when you get into the real world, outside the protctive blankie of mon, dad and school, and on your own, then you will understand the true value of money, finance, dedbt which you will incur, but you will allow for it to get out of control. Government is no different. Our current fiscal policy is out of control is is irresponsible to the American public.
Why do you think China is working towrds taking the world off of the US currency  ie Petro Dollars and using their currency as the global trading mechanism?  If they are successful, which. Hope they are not, this country will go into default and the value of the dolar will plummet, in large part to the amount of debt.
The term bond has its roots in bondage. Debt is a way of controlling behavior. The debt holders are the ones in power. The vast growth in US Government debt has consequences. Like the junky looking to fund another hit of the stuff, the debtor will soon turn to any means necessary to get the next fix. Would the IRS be administering the ACA, if there was only $1 trillion instead of $17 trillion of debt? What about our foreign policy, would the USA be so interested in attacking in dozens of countries if we had zero debt? How about banking privacy; would the USA still threaten banks in Switzerland if there was not $100 trillion in benefits promised to senior citizens?
Debt is a heavy burden for a person, a family, and a government.
I agree with Liberty Minded, and his/her typing sills are much better than mine on that lousy iPad kybrd.

The Trojans lost a nail-biter under the lights at Notre Dame Stadium 14-10 on Saturday night, as a USC team decimated by injuries at just about every offensive skill position failed to score in the second half.
The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for the Trojans in South Bend, where they hadn’t lost since 2001. USC hadn’t lost any nonconference road game since 2002, and hadn’t lost twice in a row to Notre Dame since 2000-2001.
USC had ample opportunities to overcome the deficit in the final period as the defense also held Notre Dame scoreless in the second half, but a litany of injuries, self-destructive play from the offensive line and a couple missed field goals doomed the Trojans.
“Well, we have a hurt team in there,” interim head coach Ed Orgeron said. “Unfortunately we didn’t win the game, but I really liked the way our guys played and competed to the end.”
Freshman safety Su’a Cravens gave USC the ball at the Irish 34-yard line by recovering a fumble – Notre Dame’s only turnover of the night – with 6:27 left. A perfectly targeted 16-yard pass to freshman wideout Darreus Rogers from redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler picked up a first down at the Irish 21-yard line, and the Trojans looked primed to come away with at least a field goal.
But on a play where Kessler scrambled to inside the 5-yard line, a holding penalty on junior right guard Aundrey Walker brought the ball back to the 33-yard line.
“It wasn’t a hold,” Walker said. “But the ref called it and we gotta live with it and move on … It happened so fast, I was holding my hands up because I thought it was gonna be a touchdown. And I turned around and there was a flag on the field.”
A false start by redshirt freshman left tackle Chad Wheeler dug the Trojans into a 4th and 20 situation on Notre Dame’s 26-yard line, meaning a field goal attempt would have been 43 yards. With time running down and junior kicker Andre Heidari already having missed two field goals from 40 and 46 yards out, the Trojans tried to go for the touchdown and the win. But Kessler was sacked to turn the ball over on downs.
“Going into the end, we just felt that we weren’t kicking field goals very well so [we thought] ‘Let’s go and win the game,’” Orgeron said.
USC had another chance to score after a defensive stop, but injuries to Rogers, junior wideout Marqise Lee, freshman tailback Justin Davis and redshirt junior tight end Randall Telfer forced the Trojans to stretch deep into their depth chart on the final drive – and the backups’ inexperience showed. Tight end Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick and walk-on wide receiver Robby Kolanz lined up for USC, and a false start by Cope-Fitzpatrick and two incompletions thrown to the third-string tight end killed the Trojans’ last-gasp attempt to score.
“Obviously the penalties hurt us tonight in crucial situations, and we didn’t punch it in in the red zone when we need to,” Orgeron said. “It seemed that every time we had a first down or something like that, we had a holding call or jumped offsides, shot ourselves in the foot, and then it was 2nd and 20.”
Overall, the Trojans’ offensive stats looked passable; Kessler completed 20 of 34 passes for 201 yards and senior running back Silas Redd rushed 19 times for 112 yards and a touchdown.
But after USC’s first drive of the game resulted in a touchdown, the Trojans never found the end zone again, and ended the game with a streak of 11 consecutive failed third-down attempts.
“We felt like we had that game won until there were 4 zeros on the clock, ‘til it was completely over,” redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey said. “[Notre Dame] just made a couple more plays at the end that affected the outcome.”
The Trojans had been expected to mostly split carries between the healthy quartet of backs who had registered carries against Arizona last week after redshirt sophomore Tre Madden suffered a hamstring injury. Madden wasn’t active for USC on Saturday, but Redd was tabbed for his first start of the season and seemed determined to assert himself as the starter.
The senior carried six times for 40 yards on USC’s opening drive and punched the ball in for a one-yard touchdown to give the Trojans a 7-0 lead.
The Irish attacked through the air on the next drive, as quarterback Tommy Rees completed six of seven attempts for 49 yards to lead Notre Dame to paydirt. The drive concluded with a seven-yard pass to Troy Niklas that tied up the game and put Rees over the 6,000 passing yards-mark for his career, becoming only the fifth Notre Dame quarterback to surpass that mark. Rees finished 14 of 21 for 166 yards and two touchdowns.
Notre Dame’s offense took a huge hit – literally and figuratively – when junior linebacker Lamar Dawson burst untouched on a blitz early in the third quarter and unloaded on Rees, knocking him out of the game with a neck strain.
The Irish’s offense was noticeably more conservative from that point forward, as backup quarterback Andrew Hendrix short-armed several throws while failing to complete any of his four attempts. In fact, the Irish didn’t complete any passes in the second half, a stunning feat for a team to pull off while also claiming victory.
“I wasn’t willing to throw the football, and when we did, I didn’t like the way it looked,” Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said. “Obviously we missed [Rees] in the second half … We tried to have [Hendrix] pull [the ball] and get to the sidelines, but it was tough sledding out there.”
A 48-yard punt return from sophomore wideout Nelson Agholor, the longest by a Trojan since 2010, gave USC the ball at the Notre Dame 20-yard line with just under 10 minutes left in the second quarter. The Trojans failed to reach the end zone, but Heidari was true on his second field-goal attempt from 22 yards out to give the Trojans a 10-7 lead.
After the teams traded scoreless possessions, the Irish finally gained some traction in the run game on their last drive of the half, and it resulted in their first lead in the rivalry at their home field since 2005.
Notre Dame tailback Cam McDaniel broke off a 24-yard run to the Irish 41-yard line before a blatant pass interference penalty by redshirt sophomore cornerback Anthony Brown moved the ball past midfield to the USC 47.
McDaniel followed with the longest rush of his career, a 36-yard scamper down to the USC 11-yard line, and receiver TJ Jones hauled in an impressive touchdown catch over sophomore cornerback Kevon Seymour to give the Irish a 14-10 lead that held until the final whistle.
