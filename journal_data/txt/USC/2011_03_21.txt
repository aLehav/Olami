Leaders from USC’s Women’s Student Assembly, MenCare and Take Back the Night will attend a discussion tonight on the issues of sexual violence and misogyny raised by the viral Kappa Sigma email, which has continued generating controversy.
The email, which has circulated around the university, asks members of Kappa Sigma to detail their sexual exploits to members of the fraternity. It also contains a glossary of terms to describe males, females and their body parts, categorizes women by their ethnicity and nationality and provides a rating system of female attractiveness for the fraternity members.
Corey Arterian, a senior majoring in English and one of the discussion’s organizers, said she hopes the meeting will create an open dialogue of the cultural perceptions of men and women addressed in the email.
“Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that this is not just one incident,” Arterian said. “It’s not that one guy, it’s not that one fraternity, it’s not fraternity row, it’s everywhere. This email indicates a larger problem on campus that the university really can’t ignore.”
Arterian and other undergraduate students have been in contact with eight graduate students who wrote a petition that was sent to President C. L. Max Nikias on Friday.
The petition asks for a more public and transparent investigation of the viral email and an open dialogue concerning the issues of sexual violence and misogyny. It has more than 120 graduate and faculty signatures, according to Alex Young, a graduate student studying English and an author of the petition.
The controversy  surrounding the email grew when Jezebel, a blog geared toward women, posted an article March 10 claiming Kappa Sigma Nationals and IFC hid the truth of how the email originated and was leaked to the student body. The post includes a female student’s account of how her roommate edited the email and was approached by Mitchell Wilson, executive director of Kappa Sigma Fraternity, and others to not talk to the Daily Trojan.
“I have not been to USC,” Wilson said. “I have not spoken with any person who claims to have been involved in the editing of this.”
Pat Lauer, president of IFC, said he encourages this woman to come forward to the university if she has evidence about the email.
Wilson said the Kappa Sigma nationals investigation has not concluded, and the investigation will not be finished until they are fully satisfied with the information. He noted the creator of the original email has not yet been determined.
Michael L. Jackson, vice president of student affairs, sent an email to the USC community Friday regarding the Kappa Sigma email and the investigation.
Jackson wrote that the university learned through its investigation that a USC student did not create the email, and a friend at a university on the East Coast forwarded it to the student who sent it to the USC Kappa Sigma listserv. The email was originally sent to the members of Kappa Sigma in November.
Still, some students are not satisfied.
“We have no basis for believing there is a cover-up, but the investigation would have been a lot more transparent and credible had it been clear that the administration rather than [the USC Interfraternity council] and Kappa Sigma nationals carried it out,” Young said.
Young said it was encouraging to receive a response from the university, but he believes discussion needs to continue about the issues raised by the email.
Ray Carlos, assistant director of the Office for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership, said it’s the administration’s responsibility to facilitate this dialogue about gender and sex.
“If the students are outraged, then they will put together programs,” Carlos said.
Samantha Carrick, a Ph.D. student studying English visual studies and one of the authors of the petition, said she felt the need to a take a public stand about what is and isn’t considered productive conversations about gender and sex.
“The most important thing for all of us is to force the community to begin a dialogue about this kind of rhetoric,” Carrick said. “The comments on  the Daily Trojan article seemed like if you are upset with this, then you are wrong, and I was very shocked by that.”
Jackson said USC Student Affairs’ MenCare program, which began in 2005, will be “[used] to address this situation.”
Todd Henneman, adviser to MenCare and assistant director for the Center for Women & Men, said IFC will introduce a liaison who will attend the MenCare meetings to help identify new ways to get the Greek community involved. MenCare also plans to reach out to all males on campus by encouraging them to attend Take Back the Night, an event that aims to spread awareness about sexual violence.
Emilia Ana Cosma, the executive director of Women’s Student Assembly, said she plans to meet with IFC in the upcoming weeks to discuss how the groups can work together on combating the issues raised by the email. She said she hopes IFC will start a Greeks against Sexual Assault group that is present on other campuses, including UCLA.
Lisa Locafcio, a Ph.D. student studying English literature and creative writing and an author of the petition, said she feels the petition is not radical in any way.
“I think the appropriate response from the university would be to welcome this dialogue and address community concerns,” Locafcio said.
The meeting to discuss the issues raised in the viral email will be held tonight at 8 p.m. in Taper Hall room 113.
Regarding the allegations mentioned in the above story and online blogs, Kappa Sigma Fraternity International Headquarters today issued the following statement:
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
KAPPA SIGMA FRATERNITY HEADQUARTERS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING ONGOING USC EMAIL INVESTIGATION 
Charlottesville, VA. (March 22, 2011) –- Kappa Sigma Fraternity continues to investigate the disgusting and inappropriate email that was recently circulated to the University of Southern California academic community. Today, Kappa Sigma International Headquarters’ Executive Director, Mitchell B. Wilson, issued the following statement:
“While we are not able to discuss details of an ongoing investigation, we do feel obligated to set the record straight regarding a recent inaccurate, irresponsible and potentially libelous blog post that was republished by a popular online ‘Celebrity, Sex, Fashion for Women’ blog forum. 
Under no circumstances did I, nor any member of the Kappa Sigma Headquarters staff, ever meet or speak with a woman who the anonymous blogger claimed to be her roommate and female student who edited the email being investigated. That claim was either an outright lie or a severe mischaracterization.  I have not, in fact, even traveled to the State of California in more than a year.  Kappa Sigma Fraternity is not aware of any of its members, officers, undergraduates, nor alumni ever meeting with this student.  We are concerned and alarmed by the irresponsible circulation of this untruth.
Kappa Sigma remains steadfast in its determination to pursue every angle to identify the creator of the email and hold that person accountable. We would never allow any of our members to conceal any truths or impede the investigation, which we are conducting as expeditiously as possible.  Anyone who would believe otherwise is misguided and understands nothing about the nature of our organization. 
We have been very clear since the moment this unfortunate situation came to our attention.  The content of the email is in strict contrast to the values of Kappa Sigma Fraternity — values centered upon character, honor, leadership, scholarship and service to humanity.  The individuals who created and/or circulated this email do not represent these values and will face swift and decisive action.”

Okay, no one from Kappa Sigma “Headquarters” staff met with the mystery woman living in Gateway.  Do you have any unregistered “Headquarters” staff or regional based staff or alumni advisers who along with active SC Kappa Sigmas may have taken a meeting with the mystery woman?  “Unregistered” fraternity members who happen to have leadership positions in the house are not really members by USC IFC standards….Ironic?
“Jezebel Almost Never Lies” ……. I’m seriously hoping that your screen name is supposed to be sarcastic. That website is an absolute joke.
So happy the truth may be coming out at this meeting.  The lies from Kappa Sigma and IFC need to end!
i agree with C.Art.   this is a two way street, and the issues must be openly discussed.
Too many times men treat women like sexual objects. We must strive to learn more about the genders and how they are wired.  Society does little to prepare us for marriage, unions, and relationships.  Learning about the other gender can be eye opening for everyone.  Some behavior which results  from some people is outrageous and must be dealt with appropriately.
Fight On & Learn On!!
Society at USC does little to prepare us for marriage, unions, and relationships. The culture here, especially within the Greek community, is overwhelmingly misogynist and definitely needs to be improved upon.
here we go…more “men are bad, and women are good” crud. Its all bull. Both genders have issues with the other. Women should concentrate on their attitudes towards men juts as much. the old “women are perfect and can teach men how to behave” act is getting SOOOOOOO old.
You obviously didn’t read the article. This about a dialogue both perceptions and impositions placed on men AND women and how these modes of thought are dangerous… I don’t see why any rational person would be apposed to this conversation.

Much of USC’s campus was flooded because of the rainstorm that hit Los Angeles this weekend. Downtown Los Angeles received 2.42 inches as of midnight Sunday, according to the Los Angeles Times. This is a record amount of rainfall for the first day of spring since 1943, according to the National Weather Service.

The USC women’s swim team entered the 2011 NCAA women’s swimming and diving national championships with the same goal it had all season: placing in the top five.
Cream of the crop · Junior Katinka Hosszu earned 2011 NCAA Swimmer of the Meet honors Sunday, leading the Women of Troy with wins in the 200- and 400-yard intermediate medley and the 200-yard fly. - Daily Trojan file photo 
The Women of Troy fared much better, however, and placed third Sunday in Austin, Texas. California took first place with 424 points, Georgia second with 394.5 and USC finished third with 351.
This was USC’s best performance at the NCAA competition since 2003. Not only did No. 6 USC swimmers finish off their season with the third-place victory, but junior Katinka Hosszu walked away with Swimmer of the Meet honors.
“You always get bumps in the road,” said USC coach Dave Salo. “But the women didn’t get too rattled and it was a tremendous effort. They got caught up in the excitement and didn’t worry about times; they just got out and raced really hard.”
The Women of Troy began competition at the NCAAs on Thursday, finishing in second place after the first day of events.
Georgia proved to be a strong competitor from the start, leading the field after day one. By the second day, however, the Golden Bears took the lead and the Women of Troy fell to third place, where they would remain for the rest of the competition.
“We were still under everybody’s radar [the first day], they didn’t really know how we were going to do,” Salo said. “We had a really good morning and from that point on, we were just meeting our goals.”
Although they started strong, the Women of Troy did not put all their focus on that initial ranking.
“We knew that there were two long days of competition left, so we didn’t want to get caught up in the point game,” said senior co-captain Presley Bard. “We wanted to focus on our performances, and knew that those would take care of the points.”
Named Swimmer of the Meet, Hosszu also became the second USC swimmer on the team to win three NCAA titles in the same year. With titles in the 200- and 400-yard individual medley as well as the 200-yard fly, she helped lead the team to the podium at NCAAs.
Another notable USC swimmer at the meet was senior co-captain Lyndsay DePaul. She finished off her college swimming career as a three-time finalist at the competition, and also earned individual All-American honors for the third time.
The Women of Troy now have their eyes set on next year’s goals, despite the looming departure of key seniors.
“No team is ever the same, every year is a different team,” Bard said. “I think that the team [next year] will be good. I think Lyndsay and I did a good job preparing them. Because we have people like Kasey [Carlson] and Katinka [Hosszu] on the team, it will be fine without Lyndsay and I.”
Under the radar all season, the Women of Troy made a strong statement to bring their 2010-11 season to a close.
USC hopes its strong finish is a sign of things to come.
“A lot of programs have not really considered our team to be significant,” Salo said. “This year we finally turned that corner. We are back where we belong, a top five program.”

The torrential rains of the last few days have not been a coincidence. They are a clear message from the college football gods, who know spring practice begins today:
“We’re watching you.”
USC is near the midway point of paying for its “sins” — and I use that word loosely, considering all the inconsistent rulings the NCAA has levied against schools that have committed seemingly equal or even greater transgressions (someone wearing a sweater vest in Columbus, Ohio, is sweating).
Yet considering how harsh the sanctions are, the Trojans seem to be in fairly good shape. They were still able to sign 30 new recruits, thanks to a number of early admits. There will be a lot of new faces, and, starting today, the 2011 USC football team will begin to emerge.
Football is back at Howard Jones Field and that’s what’s important. I know there’s the whole March Madness business, but I’m guessing your bracket, like 1,865,894,004 others, makes you cringe when you look at it. So let’s turn our attention to the fresh new season of USC football, one with a lot of potential and even more unanswered questions.
Here are a few storylines to watch the next few months:
How much will injuries hinder the Trojans’ progress?
A lot. USC coach Lane Kiffin’s biggest concern heading into this spring has to be injuries, particularly to the linebackers, offensive line and defensive line. Kiffin said 20 players have not yet been cleared by doctors to practice, which is a high amount considering the Trojans could not participate in or practice for a bowl game last season.
Senior middle/outside linebacker Chris Galippo (lower back) has not yet been cleared, senior weakside Shane Horton has a hip injury and junior middle Devon Kennard will miss all of spring workouts after having a hip surgery. This is bad news for a linebacking unit that underachieved last season.
Things might be even bleaker for the offensive line. Starting guard Khaled Holmes (neck stingers) will miss time. Neither Abe Markowitz (foot) nor Kevin Graf (shoulder) have been cleared to play.
On the D-line, defensive ends Armond Armstead (undisclosed illness) and Wes Horton (foot) won’t be available at the start of practice, nor will Christian Tupou, who is still recovering from knee surgery.
These injuries will hold USC back, but, on a positive note, it will give some backups and freshmen a lot more reps. This will be a plus for a Trojan team that lacked experience in its two-deep roster.
Who is going to emerge at running back?
It seems like this has been a perennial question at USC since the tailback who formerly wore No. 5 graduated. The Trojans always seem to have a slew of horses in the stable, but can never quite settle on one.
Senior Marc Tyler should emerge as the featured back. He led the Trojans in rushing a year ago, rushing for 913 yards and nine touchdowns. Most importantly, he appeared in all 13 games, which means he stayed healthy.
Sophomore Dillon Baxter will compete with Tyler. Though Baxter probably won’t get the starting spot, he can work his way into the rotation a lot more if he has a good spring. Kiffin likes to use Baxter out of the Wildcat formation because he can throw the ball (Baxter threw for one touchdown last season) and Baxter is quicker than Tyler.
Also in the mix is redshirt freshman D.J. Morgan. The Trojans often used three backs last season, so the opportunities for Morgan are wide open.
How will the young receiving corps develop?
Sophomore Robert Woods will anchor the group. Although young, Woods showed often last season that he could be Matt Barkley’s primary target.
But with the graduation of starters Ronald Johnson and David Ausberry, the Trojans are in need of more young receivers to step into major roles quickly.
At 6-foot-5, redshirt freshman Kyle Prater should eventually take over the split end spot opposite Woods, but a foot injury will keep him out of most or all of spring ball.
That leaves the door open for sophomore Markeith Ambles, redshirt sophomore De’Von Flournoy and senior Brandon Carswell to assert themselves. And they had better. A trio of talented freshmen — George Farmer, Marqise Lee and Victor Blackwell — arrive in the summer.
Until then, it’s time to enjoy the spring and the return of USC football.
Will Jesse Scroggins grab hold of the No. 2 quarterback spot?
Barkley is the undisputed starting signal-caller. The problem is there is no experience behind him. The Trojans need a solid backup to emerge, not just in case Barkley gets injured but also for next season when Barkley might enter the NFL draft.
Redshirt freshman Jesse Scroggins is the most likely candidate, based on exposure alone. But freshmen Cody Kessler and Max Wittek enrolled early and can challenge right away for the No. 2 spot.
Scroggins has a slight edge, but this competition could go any way. This battle will be crucial since it basically decides who has a leg up to winning the starting job once Barkley moves on.
“Middle Ground” runs Tuesdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Josh at jjovanel@usc.edu.
If we get a favorable decision from the NCAA on the sanctions appeal, it is game on!
FIGHT ON!!

Spring break was a welcome change for the USC baseball team.
Though they didn’t take a break from action on the diamond, the Trojans did break free of an eight-game losing skid, winning four games before Pacific snapped the Trojans’ streak Saturday, taking both games of a doubleheader.
Bringing the heat · Junior pitcher Ben Mount, who leads all USC starters with a 1.10 ERA through three games, takes to the mound for his fourth start of the year, against UC Santa Barbara, in hopes of ending the Trojans’ two-game losing streak. - Daily Trojan file photo 
“We learned a lot about ourselves as a team last week,” said junior pitcher Ben Mount. “We grew a lot and got a lot better.”
Today, USC will look to start a new winning streak at 3 p.m. when it hosts UC Santa Barbara at Dedeaux Field.
“We’ve been throwing the ball well,” said USC interim coach Frank Cruz. “Our midweek starters have been stepping it up as well.”
The Trojans will lean on a pitching staff that hadn’t allowed more than five runs in four games prior to Saturday’s losses to Pacific.
Senior starter Logan Odom was named the Pac-10 Pitcher of the Week last week after throwing seven and two-thirds scoreless innings in the Trojans’ win over UCLA on March 13.
Friday night starter Andrew Triggs also seems to have finally settled into a groove.
Triggs has won his last two starts, and in the opener against Pacific, the junior threw his third career complete game, allowing only one earned run while striking out five.
Mount, who is likely to start today against the Gauchos, leads USC starters with a 1.10 ERA. He has only allowed two earned runs in five appearances this season, including three starts. He will look to get USC back on track.
On the offensive side, senior Joe De Pinto continues to thrive in the middle of the lineup with a team-leading .353 batting average and .432 on base percentage.
Junior slugger Ricky Oropesa still has yet to hit a home run after hitting 20 dingers last season. The preseason All-American does lead the team with six doubles and is tied for the team lead with 14 runs while batting .338.
The metro Atlanta outfield duo of junior Alex Sherrod and sophomore Alex Glenn has provided the power in Oropesa’s stead.
The two have combined to hit all six of the team’s homers. Sherrod is second in the Pac-10 with four home runs — one behind Arizona’s Josh Garcia.
The Trojans’ bats will need to hit UC Santa Barbara mid-week starter Nick Loredo (2-0, 3.15 ERA) better than they did last time out when Laredo held USC to two runs in seven and one-third innings.
“We need to execute better [to win this time]” Mount said. “We weren’t ready last time.”
Laredo picked up the 3-2 win as Matt Vedo came on to pick up the save in the ninth inning as the Trojans left the bases loaded.
In that game, second baseman Sean Williams had a pair of hits, including a two-run double. Williams has continued to stay hot. In his last four games, he is batting .667 (10-15) and has driven in three runs.
Among USC’s five wins during the extended week was a 2-0 victory against then-No. 13 UCLA in the Dodgertown Classic at Dodger Stadium.
The Trojans split their first two games of the Dodgertown Classic, beating Saint Mary’s 6-2 before losing to Georgia 5-3.
USC followed up the Dodgertown Classic with a two-game sweep of Big East power Louisville, who came to Dedeaux Field with an 11-3 record and ranked No. 19 by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association.
That doubleheader loss was really disconcerting now need to be a plus four just to reach .500 on the season. Must win vs. UCSB today and have to win 2 out of 3 against the ‘ruins this coming weekend to be headed in the right direction to overcome that eight game losing streak. Not one homer from a California player says a lot about recruiting which has put the program way behind.

Los Angeles is not shy about its street food culture. Already, the gospel of Korean tacos has been evangelized across the culinary world.
But until recently, Berlin, another city with a raging appetite for street food, has been silent about its own iconic imbisse: the currywurst.
No longer.
Berlin Currywurst, a German snack bar that opened three weeks ago in  Silver Lake by three friends from Germany, is the first place to sell currywurst in Los Angeles.
The owners, Haike Büntemeyer and husband-and-wife duo Hardeep and Lena Manak, moved to Los Angeles from Germany three months ago. Their decision to leave their stable office jobs was set in motion after they visited friends in Los Angeles and were aghast that currywurst was nowhere to be found, despite the city’s hip, international street food culture.
The origin of currywurst holds as much historical and cultural significance as Korean tacos. Currywurst was invented in 1949 after World War II when a Berlin woman mixed popular ingredients she obtained from British soldiers and served it on top of the traditional German pork sausage.
Visit Berlin Currywurst and you’ll see why the dish became so popular among the Germans.

Berlin Currywurst offers sausage, pork and beef along with a variety of sauces and the choice of the level of intensity. Vegetarians can also find culinary bliss with the snack bar’s tasty tofu-bratwurst.
– Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
The menu is simple and minimalistic. You choose your sausages, from the basic bratwurst (pork) and rindswurst (beef), to the more innovative scharfe kasewurst (beef with jalapeno and cheese) and tofu-kielbasa.
For an extra 89 cents, you can also flavor your sauce four ways: fruity, chipotle, jambalaya or garlic. You then choose the level of heat or spice from a scale of one (Berlin calling) to four (Break the Wall), but co-owner Hardeep suggests sticking to the original no-heat sauce for currywurst virgins.
Listen to Hardeep’s advice, especially if you want to get the pure taste of currywurst. The safest and most authentic order is the bratwurst with the original sauce and minimal amount of heat. It is a tried-and-true combination that does not disappoint.
The all-natural pork sausage, plump in its natural casing, comes doused in a rich, brilliantly red sauce dusted in deep orange curry powder. The flavors dance from sweet to spicy, tangy and savory, tasting both familiar and eccentric.
Unlike the typical sausage-in-bun most Angelenos are used to, the fat sausage is cut into thick slices with no fluffy bun.
Instead, the dish is served alongside two hearty slices of Bauernbrot (German farmers bread), which hold a nice, crispy crust and a chewy, slightly sour crumb.
For vegetarians and vegans, the tofu-bratwurst is still a more-than-satisfactory option. The texture of the meatless sausage still retains a firm and juicy chew, though it lacks the intensity of real meat. But currywurst is really all about the sauce, so with a hefty scoop of the thick tomato-based sauce, even the most hard-core carnivores will approve.
Unless you were introduced to chili at a young age, stick to minimal heat or keep a sweetened drink nearby to cool your burning tongue. Hardeep was not kidding when he solemnly cautioned, several times, “I’m warning you, it’s incredibly spicy,” when I asked for the level four spice.
The heat stings from your cheeks down to your throat. It’s tolerable at the first, but by the last bite, your stomach will feel as if it was holding a hot brick. But, it is still delicious.
Hardeep said he limits the spice levels to four because of a previous lawsuit in which a man’s glands swelled from the heat.
But he divulged that a doubly fiery recipe is in the works, although he will keep the option in a hidden menu only for experienced spice daredevils.
Berlin Currywurst also sells the iconic fritten, hand-cut fries made from organic potatoes. Try them topped with grilled, buttery onions or jambalaya (a lemony spice, not the Creole stew), and dipped into mayonnaise, which Berlin Currywurst provides in a bottle at every table. The fries, which have an orange hue like sweet potatoes, are thick and nicely crisped, holding up to the toppings well.
For the amount of flavor its menu provides, Berlin Currywurst is tiny. It barely has space to squeeze in 15 customers.
That means parking is a pain, but this is Los Angeles. Given that the currywurst stands in Berlin barely provide seats at all, Berlin Currywurst is as original as it can get.
Berlin Currywurst is located on 3827 West Sunset Blvd.

What’s the recipe for success? Try combining Avril Lavigne’s lyrics, Miley Cyrus’ voice and Ke$ha’s wild club beats. At least, that’s what Miranda Cosgrove came up with.
Close up · Though High Maintenance contains catchy tunes and help from well known musicians, the songwriting ultimately falls short. - Photo courtesy of Press Here Publicity  
Although Cosgrove’s new album High Maintenance is not a unique addition to the pop music world, the EP makes up for its lack of authenticity with some solid, catchy tunes.
High Maintenance is Cosgrove’s second EP. The album’s first single, “Dancing Crazy,” was released Dec. 21 and peaked at No. 49 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. Its success makes sense: The single is catchy and youthful. The lyrics are all about dancing and having fun. In fact, the track is somewhat reminiscent of Cyrus’ “Party In the U.S.A.”
The song is co-written by Avril Lavigne, and the Canadian star’s inspiration is painfully obvious in the final product — even in its musical composition. The opening instrumentals are almost identical to those in Lavigne’s “What the Hell.”
Cosgrove even sounds like Lavigne at several points throughout the song. At other times, however, the song takes more Ke$ha-inspired twists.
When Cosgrove says, I like you, and you like me / We get together and we’re happy, she talks it more than she sings it, a technique clearly borrowed from Ke$ha’s vocals in songs such as “Tik Tok” and “Blah Blah Blah.”
Likewise, at the end of “Sayonara,” Cosgrove’s melody fades out with a deep, intimidating male voice, much like many of Ke$ha’s hits.
Although “Dancing Crazy” is a decent hit that reels in listeners with a mixture of contemporary pop characteristics, Cosgrove’s first single should have been “High Maintenance.” This is the song both male and female listeners will find entertaining and dance-worthy.
Cosgrove teamed up with alternative rock band Weezer’s lead vocalist Rivers Cuomo for the male-female duet.  
The combination of vocals is a generally euphonious mashup. Although Cuomo is more than 20 years older than 17-year-old Cosgrove, their voices lend fun and flirtatiousness to an endearingly clever song.
Cosgrove continuously asks if wanting everything makes her high maintenance. Meanwhile, Cuomo answers, You crashed my new Ferrari then said, ‘Fix the dent!’ / Yes, that makes you high maintenance.
The funny lyrics are memorable and cute without sounding overtly cheesy.
Unfortunately, Cosgrove’s voice isn’t exactly memorable. Cosgrove often falls victim to the Justin Bieber predicament, sounding more immature and whiny than she should at her age.
Aside from the witty banter in “High Maintenance,” the lyrics on the rest of the album are overly mushy and almost laughable. Most of the songs, although catchy, are overwhelmingly clichéd and full of fluffy love references and silly rhymes.
“Face of Love,” for instance, has one of the best beats on the album. It’s intense and seductive in an almost Twilight-esque manner, but the lyrics eliminate any poignant meaning when Cosgrove sings the chorus: Something in your eyes / I recognize it / Baby, could you be the face of love?
In “Kiss You Up,” Cosgrove’s slower, ballad-type song, the lyrics are even cornier as she sings, Anytime that you want me round / I’ll be there at the speed of sound.
Similar lyrical issues arise in Cosgrove’s fifth track, “Sayonara,” which blatantly stereotypes Japanese culture. In the song, Cosgrove asks for someone to work me out like karate and says like a ninja out of the dark / I’ll steal your heart.
Cosgrove’s attempts to be creative and hip simply end up perpetuating archaic and simplistic notions of Japanese society.
Despite the weak lyrics, the Japanese stereotypes and the childish-sounding vocals, Cosgrove delivers an impressive album that is sure to keep garnering attention.
The songs might have horribly corny phrases, but none of them detract from the superb beats that will carry the EP, and Cosgrove, to success.

It looks like love is in the air on Glee.
Romance is by no means out of the ordinary on the Fox series, but this time, it’s a little different.
Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and second-season heartthrob Blaine (Darren Criss) finally united in last week’s episode, “Original Song.”
Besides offering some long overdue happiness to the endlessly victimized Kurt, who has spent much of his screen time this season on the verge of tears, the relationship is an important step for gay characters on network television.
Glee has already received praise and media attention for its portrayal of gay teenagers. The anti-gay bullying plotline, in which Kurt was abused by a homophobic classmate, directly acknowledged national concern over last fall’s tragic number of suicides by gay teens.
One of the youngest gay characters ever to appear on television, Kurt was praised for “changing hearts, minds, and Hollywood” in a recent Entertainment Weekly cover story regarding gay teens on TV.
Now Glee is pushing the envelope for network TV once again by beginning to explore Kurt’s burgeoning sexuality, something the network was already done with most of the straight characters.
Even as gay characters started to become a more regular fixture on network television in the ’90s and early 2000s, they were often portrayed as asexual or lacking love lives, especially when compared to straight characters.
If gay characters, especially men, were in relationships, they were often sterilized, and any display of affection was unrealistically absent so as to remain palatable to mainstream audiences.
Consider Will & Grace. Grace went through her share of men in the show’s eight-year run, but Will’s love life was notably lackluster.
Although the sitcom was groundbreaking in the centrality of its gay characters, it was severely limited in its depiction of gay sexuality or romance.
Even Modern Family, which many praise as progressive for its portrayal of long-term partners Mitch and Cameron, caused some controversy for its failure to show the couple kissing.
Their parenting and relationship problems mirror those of the straight couples on the show, but unlike the other couples, the two men rarely display any physical affection. It wasn’t until the second season that Mitch and Cam finally shared an innocent smooch.
And until very recently, Glee fell into this same trend of seeming to be progressive but really playing it safe.
Kurt remained largely asexual, and the show’s most significant foray into same-sex romance was between Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris), who were occasionally shown making out in their short-skirted cheerleading uniforms.
The show recently began seriously exploring the possibility of actual romantic feelings between them, but the two actresses effectively serve as eye-candy, and their physical encounters offer an easy means of attracting male viewers who enjoy physical interaction between women. With the male characters, it’s not so easy.
Two of the latest episodes of Glee began to directly address the issue of gay males hiding their sexuality. When Kurt’s father expresses discomfort with Kurt having a romantic encounter with a guy, Kurt asks him, “So it’s not being gay that upsets you, it’s me acting on it?”
This is exactly the message shows like Will & Grace send when they edit all the sex out of homosexuality.
But last week, Kurt and Blaine finally shared not only one passionate kiss, but two. And legitimate kissing, not just a passionless peck.
Two good kisses, some hand-holding and a monogamous relationship might not seem like anything to get worked up about, especially for a show that tends to be quite gratuitous in depicting and discussing straight teenage sexuality.
Glee seems fully aware of the precedent in gay representation on network TV, and it is poised to break the boundaries that have been set and give us something more real.
Here’s to hoping Fox won’t lose its nerve, and Kurt and Blaine can experience the same kind of happiness and drama afforded to the rest of Glee’s heterosexual cast.

Adderall and Viagra have nothing on NZT-48, which makes a person impossibly smart and focused — until of course, the effects wear off and the unlisted side effects kick in.
It’s a trite lesson tied in with a new thriller science-fiction twist: What if there were a miracle pill that would unleash the full potential of brainpower?
Playing off the notion that humans only use about 10 percent of their brain functions, Limitless toys with the danger and possibility of being a super-genius using exhilarating visual effects and an action-packed subplot.
Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a depressed bum who lives in a stink-hole in New York City’s Chinatown. He’s a writer, except he has yet to write a single sentence. His girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish), sick of being his bank account, dumps him.
That same day, as he wanders back to his home, he bumps into his sleazy ex-wife’s brother (Johnny Whitworth), who hooks him up with a clear pill as inconspicuous as a collar button. Unsurprisingly, it’s not FDA-approved.
The movie first introduces a well-groomed, handsome Eddie in a smart business suit, teetering on the high-rise balcony of his new $8 million loft, while a gang of Russian thugs tries to chainsaw their way through his blast-resistant steel door.
Although the premise sounds worn, the movie’s visual effects really make it stand out.
At one point, the camera travels down that same glass building, whooshing through the streets of Manhattan and screeching back months earlier at the café ,where Eddie gets dumped.
Limitless is not a movie to watch on your laptop or iPhone screen. The stunning cinematography and visual effects deserve to be enjoyed in an IMAX.
Even though it has no 3-D effects, the film makes you feel like you’re leaping out of your seat, leaving you in a dizzy whirl.
Director Neil Burger (The Illusionist) does an excellent job of transporting the audience into Eddie’s pharmaceutically jacked-up mind each time he takes the pill. The whole world warms up in a golden glow and distorts in fisheye vision, every detail suddenly inescapable.
Eddie then finds himself advising his landlord’s wife on her graduate thesis paper (and seducing her) and later opening up his laptop and churning out half a novel in one night.
But as with any other drug, the effects wear off, and Eddie is left wanting more. After a panic attack, greed takes over and Eddie ransacks his now-dead former brother-in-law’s apartment and pockets a full bag of NZT-48 pills.
With an escalating dose of these pills, Eddie racks up millions in the stock market and coaches corporate tycoon Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) on complex mega-mergers. He masters the piano in three days, flirts with a waitress in fluent Italian and charms high society with his intelligence.
But Eddie soon realizes he’s not the only person who has popped NZT-48. There are others — all of whom are either dead or gravely ill.
As Eddie starts experiencing the dark effects of the drug, such as losing track of time, he also finds himself stalked by a mysterious scarred fellow and a Russian loan shark with a penchant for flaying his victims (Andrew Howard), demanding a piece of NZT-48.
Not much is realistic in this movie. There are some cheesy moments, such as when Eddie breezily beats up seven men à la Bruce Lee, or when the room starts pelting shiny alphabet letters as Eddie furiously types his novel.
But toss aside the boundaries of logic and embrace the limitless, and you’ll find yourself sucked into the movie’s fast-paced plot and colorful characters.
Cooper shifts between the roles of pathetic addict and suave high-profiler with convincing ease. It doesn’t take all 100 percent of your brain to appreciate his fluid charisma on screen.
All other characters take on minor supporting roles, but with individual aplomb.
De Niro is cool and gruff as usual, a subtle smirk or scowl projecting neat character depth.
Howard, as bone-chilling as his character, delivers his lines with such humorous sincerity that you cannot help liking him — until he lays out his torture devices. Whitworth oozes slime and cockiness during the few precious moments he has on-screen.
Limitless could have taken a deep psychological moral stance, but writer Leslie Dixon wisely skirts preachy philosophies and punches in typical Hollywood entertainment with just enough chase, blood and sex.
It might not thrill your mind, but it will thrill your every sense and leave you tingling at the edge of your seat.

Factories need attention.
As the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, we urge USC to buy clothes from the Alta Gracia factory in the Dominican Republic, where workers recently unionized and now make a living wage.
As a visiting delegation of workers from that factory showed last semester, the working and living conditions of the garment workers there have been significantly improved.
Moreover, we see this as an opportunity for USC to support just labor practices and the right to collective bargaining that so many people working in third world countries are denied.
A July 2010 New York Times article covered the factory’s practices and hopes, saying “Many say Alta Gracia has gone further than others by embracing higher wages and unionization.”
Duke University has already committed to buying a minimum of $250,000 of apparel from Alta Gracia.
“This sometimes seems too good to be true,” Jim Wilkerson, Duke’s director of licensing, told the Times.
We are asking USC to match Duke’s offer and build a working relationship with the factory.
SCALE is looking forward to working with students, faculty and administrators to make this a reality.
By working together, we can make a difference for those who are not as fortunate as us.
We believe that by buying apparel from Alta Gracia, USC would embody its commitment, as written in the workplace code of conduct, in making sure “products are manufactured in safe work environments that respect worker’s rights.”

Complete this sentence: “Greeks gone … ”
If your first guess was “wild,” you should take a closer look at our campus right now.
The “Greeks Gone Green” campaign, a push by the Panhellenic Council for increased sustainability at USC, kicked off March 7 and will continue until Friday.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Eco-friendly paraphernalia including T-shirts, water bottles and canvas bags are being sold around campus and will fund a new recycling program on The Row.
But what’s most interesting is how the campaign has actually extended beyond the Greek community to incorporate USC as a whole.
Though the focus might be on sustainability on The Row, the campaign has formed so many partnerships and elicited so much publicity that everyone around campus is reminded that, Greek or not, the same problems and the same practices should be implemented.
The campaign, which includes partnerships with both CalPIRG and the Office of Sustainability, has been plastered all over Facebook. The campaign invited not just the social fraternities and sororities to participate, but multicultural, professional and academic houses as well.
And although USC isn’t partnering with any other schools, the sentiments aren’t restricted to Los Angeles; the University of California at Santa Barbara and San Diego have similar campaigns.
Panhellenic won’t know how much money has been raised until the campaign is finished, but by publicizing it to the extent that it has, Panhellenic has at least gotten our attention.
Greeks Gone Green has served as a jumping-off point for other sustainable projects in the Greek community, including an upcoming guest speaker and Greek service day during Earth Week.
Zara Abrams, Panhellenic Vice President of Scholarship, said the main goal of the campaign was to raise sustainability awareness in the Greek community and the student body.
“Unity among Greeks and among the entire student body is essential if we wish to enact change,” Abrams wrote in an email.
Some might point out fraternities and sororities are essentially obligated to engage in philanthropic endeavors. Some might even argue such a campaign probably has more to do with promoting a favorable image than with a genuine interest in a recycling program.
But each house already has its own philanthropy, and Panhellenic did seem to create the event simply out of the realization that recycling bins were not a large presence on The Row.
Regardless of intention, it’s refreshing to see this type of project come from an organization that does not inherently revolve around sustainability the way CalPIRG and others do (although that’s not to say we appreciate them any less).
And to see CalPIRG and the Greek community work together in the coming weeks to reduce The Row’s carbon footprint is a win-win situation for everyone.
Of course, one of the most obvious measures in such a campaign would be for Greeks and non-Greeks alike to cut down on the army of red plastic cups left strewn across The Row every Friday morning.
But until students decide to take that plunge, we can at least remember to recycle them.

USC students should be first in line to receive a significant portion of the David and Dana Dornsifes’ unprecedented $200 million donation.
USC is one of the most prestigious  schools in the nation to attend. Yet, with sky-high tuition, pricey room and board and a plethora of other fees, by the time USC students toss their graduation caps in the air, they can face massive financial problems.
Deborah Ho| Daily Trojan
To pay for their education, many students either get full or part-time jobs during the school year, or apply for scholarships and financial aid.
According to College Board, in the fall of 2010, about 1,900 freshmen at USC applied for need-based financial aid, but only 1,100 received it; leaving 800 searching for other options which include either scoring some big-time scholarships or raiding Grandma’s piggy-bank.
Every year, thousands of students apply for a limited number of scholarships.
Imagine what the Dornsifes’ $200 million donation could accomplish by creating several more scholarship opportunities for students who desperately need more monetary assistance than what the financial aid office can offer.
Unfortunately, USC has a habit of spending monstrous lump sums of money on big buildings and esoteric research projects, rather than scholarships for students.
Admittedly, this is largely because donors often demand their money be used for these purposes.
George Lucas gave the School of Cinematic Arts $175 million in 2006, specifically for a new building. In the fall, the Annenberg Foundation gave Annenberg $50 million, again explicitly for the purpose of constructing a new building.
But the Dornsifes’ donation to the College of Letters, Arts, & Sciences is unrestricted — the College can do whatever it wants with the money.
Top faculty, productive research and state-of-the-art facilities certainly help make USC the 23rd best college in the nation according to the U.S. World and News Report of 2011.
But the main reason USC is one of the best universities in the country is the caliber of its students.
Getting into USC is a tough task in itself. Sticking around is another challenge.
USC students have to earn high grades and high salaries in order to avoid succumbing to student loans and tremendous debt come graduation.
USC asks undergraduates to perform well in class but at the same time acquire jobs that take significant time away from studying.
Students deserve a piece of the Dornsife pie just as much as their professors, if not more so.
Of course, the university should use some of the Dornsife donation to fund faculty and boost research.
The most effective way to better the university, however, is to give students the gift of economic peace of mind by increasing the number and size of scholarships.
In essence, most donations to the university are made to advance the quality of student life and improve students’ educational experiences.
Students should spend time studying, leading active social lives and enjoying their college years instead of worrying about how to pay for it all.
The Dornsife donation, if used strategically, can help make that happen.

Rich, I grew up in a state with very sub-standard public schools (Not even top 100). Are you saying that because I had the misfortune to grow up in a state without strong public institutions that I should belittle the hard work I did in high school to qualify for a top tier college? And get a job? Are you kidding me? USC costs in the neighborhood of 45k a year, good luck making even a small dent in that with a minimum wage job in south central. You speak casually of a battle YOU have most likely never been part of. Some of the brightest minds in the United States grow up poor, it is USC’s duty to provide opportunities for ambitious students regardless of the financial implications. It is not charity, financial aid to the needy is an INVESTMENT.
Conrad, thank you for writing this article. I only hope it can be more widely distributed to the people who can make an impact. Maintaining a strong GPA and building up a resume of extracurricular activities and unpaid internships is difficult enough to be competitive in today’s market, without having to work a full time job. If the money is made available by a couple as generous as the Dornsifes, it is in my opinion a complete error in judgment to not put a significant portion of the unrestricted donation toward student scholarships. Moreover, those students who are worthy of receiving USC scholarships (but for some reason do not get as much help as they need) are then left to apply to various alumni groups for minuscule amounts of money in comparison to an ECA of over $50,000.00/year. These applications which have to be reapplied for annually take hours away from student studies and leave these students at a competitive disadvantage. All I’m saying is that if the money has been donated without restriction, then student scholarships to ensure that USC retains the best and brightest Trojans is by far the most effective use (or part thereof) of the Dornsife donation.
UHHHH…here is an idea to cut costs for students not wanting a large private school bill after college is over….GO TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL. I swear, the whining and give me give me attitude of students today is hilarious. Going to college is not a right, or something you have to do, and attending a private college is an outright privilege. Maybe you can do what I did while in college (yes, private college), and get a JOB. Its the tough way to go, and it will be hard, and you wont get 7 hours of sleep every night, but it is worth it. Its alot better then whining and crying with your hand out.
Couldn’t agree more Rich!

Cinderella manages to make an appearance every March in the college basketball world, and this year, the shoe fits for Virginia Commonwealth University.
The same team that knocked off USC in one of the NCAA Tournament’s inaugural “First Four” games has defied all expectations by winning two more games and earning a spot in the Sweet Sixteen.
Led by second-year coach Shaka Smart, the No. 11 Rams knocked off No. 3 Purdue and No. 6 Georgetown to be one of four teams left in the Southwest bracket. Both victories were resounding: VCU beat Georgetown 74-56 on Friday and Purdue 94-76 on Sunday.
Sunday’s victory was especially sweet for a team many analysts and fans said had no room being in the tournament — even as a First Four team that had to play an additional game to get in the field of 64.
“I think the committee is sitting back smiling now,” VCU senior guard Brandon Rozzell told ESPN. “I’d tell them, ‘Thanks for putting us in a position to make a name for ourselves.'”
Though the Rams might have proven they belong, the road to Houston still has some uncertainty. VCU faces No. 10 Florida St. on Friday, the same team that had an upset of its own, topping No. 2 Notre Dame 71-57 on Sunday night. If the Rams pull off another victory, they face either No. 12 Richmond (who upset No. 4 Louisville) or the No. 1 Kansas Jayhawks, a team looking to make its second Final Four appearance since 2008 — the same year they won the title game.
Still, VCU players say they are in it to win — regardless of what critics have said.
“To everybody we play, we’re still gonna be little ol’ VCU that’s not supposed to be here,” senior forward James Skeen told ESPNW’s Sarah Spain. “We just gotta keep proving people wrong.”
