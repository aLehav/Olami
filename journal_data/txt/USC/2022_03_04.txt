USC ended its indoor mask mandate Monday as announced by Provost and Senior Vice President of Student Affairs Charles Zukoski in a communitywide email Friday. 
Masks are no longer required in “classrooms, labs, offices, libraries, recreational facilities, dining facilities, and athletic facilities,” reversing the masking mandate put in place July 15, 2021. 
USC will continue to require masks in health facilities, at testing sites and on public transportation. 
The updated guidelines come after Los Angeles County dropped its indoor mask mandate Friday following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s L.A. County classification into the low community transmission category, a metric calculated by case counts, hospital admissions and hospital capacity. 
“We’re entering an era where, as we move from a pandemic to endemic, things [are] going to drive the need for these other measures, particularly masking … are we in a situation as a community where we would have cases that don’t exponentially increase? And, more importantly, the cases don’t overwhelm the healthcare system,” Van Orman said.
L.A. currently averages 1,636 daily positive cases, compared to the more than 40,000 at the height of the omicron peak in mid-January. At USC, both student and employee positivity rates dropped below 1% in late February, down from a semester-high of nearly 15%. 
The end of the mask mandate does not mark the end of USC coronavirus mitigation. The University will continue requiring Trojan Check — a daily symptom check survey — for all students, faculty, and staff to access campus, dining halls and gyms.
USC ended weekly testing requirements for fully vaccinated and boosted individuals March 1. Testing, currently required for unvaccinated or unboosted students, staff and faculty, remains available for anyone.
Unvaccinated community members are required to test every 72 hours; unboosted students are required to test twice weekly and unboosted staff and faculty are required to test weekly. The University also removed its “no-guest” policy in residence halls and ended the reservation system for gyms on March 1. 
Zukoski also encouraged students to pick up a take-home rapid antigen testing kit, available for free at the Lyon Center and USC Bookstore. Students are instructed to take a rapid test 24 hours before returning to campus from spring break, then test again via pop testing three to five days after returning. 
The updated policy is going into effect before spring break to make sure students are aware of the changes before returning to campus at the end of the month, Van Orman said in the media briefing. 
“We could potentially have a period of heightened risk,” Van Orman said. “As people come back to the classrooms we want to make sure everybody has time to understand what the changes are and make sure people are comfortable.”
Defne Aslan, a freshman majoring in international relations, said she will keep wearing a mask unless the majority of her classmates stop wearing one. 
“I think it’s good that we’re making progress, [and] the pandemic is becoming less of a life altering thing, but also I’m kind of confused about how a few weeks ago when we got back from break literally everyone I knew got COVID,” Aslan said. “Now there’s a lot less cases which is really good, but I’m surprised about how fast everything changed.”
Cameron Klein, a senior majoring in theatre and business administration, said he is excited for the mandate to be lifted, and especially to have a “normal” graduation.
“We should just continue to move forward with our lives and embrace the fact that we’re able to see each other’s faces,” Klein said.
Across L.A. County, colleges and universities have announced different masking guidelines. While Loyola Marymount University announced an end to its mandate Friday, California State University at Northridge previously said that they intend to require masks for the duration of the spring semester. UCLA and Caltech have yet to announce mask policy updates. 
Zukoski thanked the USC community for its support during the last two years of coronavirus mitigation measures. 
“We deeply appreciate all the acts of community support that you have shown, and the consideration you have given for all who have labored these long two years to keep our campuses safe,” Zukoski wrote in the communitywide letter. “You have our deeply felt gratitude for continuing to show kindness toward one another as we begin this transition.”

Thomas Reilly’s love for the French language drew him to Paris, France. Both of his grandparents speak French and, once he began studying the language, he fell in love with the idea of traveling to France and learning more about the language and culture. Now in Paris through USC’s study abroad program, Reilly lives with a host family and spends his time studying with other USC students and exploring the city.
This school year marks the first time students are leaving the country and spending their semesters abroad since the coronavirus pandemic. Each school at USC hosts a plethora of study abroad opportunities in countries across the world that have been called off since March 2020. 
Many students are studying abroad again after losing several semesters of in-person school to the pandemic.
Reilly, a sophomore majoring in aerospace engineering and French, left for Paris in January. Because of the engineering curriculum’s restrictiveness, this was the only semester he could spend abroad, despite only attending one semester in person at USC.  
“While I had the opportunity in college to do something that’s kind of unrelated to my major, I really wanted to take advantage of it because I think the value of experiencing things outside of our chosen field is often under-appreciated,” Reilly said. “When I have the chance to experience something new and different, I want to take advantage of it.”
Although coronavirus restrictions have made ​​it difficult to meet people, Reilly said his homestay has been a great way to be exposed to the country’s lifestyle and culture firsthand, rather than living in an apartment with other students.
“Even though I’ve missed out on 25% of my college experience, growing up in America and in the States, for me, personally, I haven’t had a ton of cultural exposure to places outside of America,” Reilly said. “I just decided that I felt that going to a new country living somewhere completely different from where I grew up and meeting people coming from completely different backgrounds is more important than spending a few extra months on campus.” 
Like Reilly, Ava Brand, a junior majoring in journalism, is spending her spring semester abroad through the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in Rome.
Leading up to her departure, the Annenberg Rome group was uncertain if they would be able to leave. Some programs, such as Australia and New Zealand, were ultimately canceled because of the coronavirus this semester. Brand said she felt confident that they would leave a week before their departure when it had yet to be canceled. 
“We had a group chat and then in December, people kind of started getting concerned,” Brand said.  “We were registered for classes and then they told us to register at USC, so then people started to get a little more worried.”
Brand now lives in an apartment with several other Annenberg students studying abroad. In between classes, Brand said she spends her time exploring, trying new food and traveling around the country. The only main limitation she has faced as a result of coronavirus is the inability to leave the country, but restrictions in Europe have lifted this month in some countries. 
“I feel like I’m getting the same experience that I would have gotten without COVID, but I guess it just adds a unique layer to the experience,” Brand said.
Many students at USC chose to give up another semester of on campus instruction in hopes of getting more out of their college experience. Bianca Bueno, a junior majoring in journalism, chose to study abroad in hopes of broadening her horizons and cultural immersions. 
“There were a lot of restrictions that weren’t still standing in the U.S. so it was hard to adjust to that and it didn’t really allow me to travel outside of Italy for the whole first month but in reality, it was kind of a silver lining,” Bueno said. “It has actually allowed me to enjoy Italy as a country and be able to experience these places on a more local level and not such a touristic level.”

Uliana Kolysnichenko was having dinner and making plans to go to the beach with friends Sunday evening when she received an unexpected phone call from her mother. Kherson International Airport in the Ukrainian Kherson Oblast was just bombed, and her hometown was being destroyed. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” on Ukraine last Thursday, bombing various cities, including the capital, Kyiv. This came after months of diplomatic efforts to deter Russia from invading Ukraine. 
Kolysnichenko, a junior majoring in business administration, left Ukraine in 2014 when tensions with Russia escalated following the Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea. Her mother is currently in Denmark, but her uncles, cousins and grandparents were in Ukraine when Russian attacks started. One of her uncles drove for three days through devastated landscapes to the Ukraine-Poland border, where he dropped off her cousins and aunt before going back to enlist in the army.
Kolysnichenko said she feels helpless and frustrated over not being able to help her country directly. Her main cause of frustration is the propaganda the Russian government has been spreading, which has led to some soldiers believing they were going to training activities when in reality they were invading Ukraine. Although Kolysnichenko wishes she could volunteer to help people, her academic responsibilities do not permit it.
“You’re stuck in a position where you kind of feel guilty that you’re here and that you’re safe. Like you should have been there. You should have been helping. This should have happened to you,” Kolysnichenko said. “But we’re lucky enough to be here today.”
Alex Chouliak, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was finalizing spring break plans when she saw an Instagram post about bombs the Russian army was dropping on Kyiv. She immediately called her mother, who, despite living in the capital, had not yet seen the news. The next day, her mother’s friends and Chouliak’s father moved to her mother’s house because it has a basement, which is safer against bombings. 
“I was panicking. I remember that day, specifically, because it was one of the first days where I was just in this constant state of fear,” Chouliak said. 
Maksim Franko, who wrote a Letter to the Editor to the Daily Trojan detailing ways in which students can help Ukraine, said he does not believe students realize the gravity of the invasion. Some students seem to think the war is a small-scale conflict happening far from the United States, he said.
“[Some students] attribute this to some sort of imperialist agenda of NATO and the U.S., and they shift the focus from the issue to something else that is also important and, yet, not the prime urgency,” Franko said.
Although his professors have been understanding of the situation and lenient with deadlines, Franko, a senior majoring in economics and math, said the University could do a better job of supporting affected students. Students may need to travel to see family, in which case it would be helpful if they were allowed to continue their studies remotely, Franko said.
Chouliak also said the lack of administrative coordination has proved difficult to deal with. Despite having lived in Ukraine for 17 years, Chouliak is not Ukrainian by nationality. This resulted in the University’s delay in reaching out to her until about a week after the attacks started, which angered her, considering the low population of Ukrainian students at USC. 
“[University administration] couldn’t even go as far as to check the records past nationality,” Chouliak said. “I felt like I was forgotten about because [the invasion] is not something that happens every day. I felt like they could put a bit more effort in and then I lost it.” 
Chouliak later received an email informing her of the resources available to her, including Campus Support and Intervention and USC Counseling and Mental Health. However, this did little to address her main concern about her education: Whether she will be able to pay tuition for next semester now that her parent’s financial situation remains uncertain as a result of the war.
“[The University] could have done a better job just making sure that we’re okay, that we’re equipped to deal with school and everything to do with finance, because, one day, not only do you not know if your parents are in safety and your friends and family are doing okay, all of a sudden, you don’t know if you will have somewhere to stay during the summer, if you can afford tuition for next year,” Chouliak said. “Everything just goes upside down.”
Chouliak said the University could better support students by consolidating resources students may need during this time, such as financial services and academic accommodations, so that, instead of having to go to multiple different offices for different issues, students can have these issues addressed holistically.
“It feels like I have to go up there and keep asking for help or for some understanding,” Chouliak said. “There wasn’t some kind of universal message like, ‘Okay, let’s discuss the situation.’”
Chouliak said her discontent with the University’s response to the invasion was aggravated by Tau Kappa Epsilon’s party last Friday: The party was initially themed “TKE Tropik Thunder” but later changed to “TKE Tropik Jungle” following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
In photos and videos obtained by the Daily Trojan, party attendees are seen wearing black paint on their faces and donning camouflage-patterned bucket hats and attire. The advertisements for the party, posted to the TKE Instagram account, featured a photo of rapper-singer Drake in full military costume, and a scene of a character from the Vietnam War satire film “Tropic Thunder” (2008) wearing military attire and wielding a rifle. 
Chouliak said she has felt a disconnection between the community and the reality of the invasion. Memes shared on social media and jokes about the war Chouliak heard in class furthered these feelings, she said. 
“I was literally sitting in class today and someone behind me was making jokes about Russia,” Chouliak said. “It hits too close to home right now to hear someone joke around.”
Sharing information, giving exposure to the war and reaching out to affected peers are ways to support students, Kolysnichenko said. Community members can also donate to organizations that support the Ukrainian military and critical infrastructure, such as the National Bank of Ukraine and Come Back Alive, which Franko listed in his Letter to the Editor.
“People have been reaching out to me over the past few days, offering their support and showing their love and they always say, ‘I know this is not enough. I wish I could do more,’ but it is enough,” Kolysnichenko said. “It helps a lot to feel that people are on your side.” 
Franko said the war has shown the courageous spirit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who refuses to leave or surrender the country. The comedian-turned-politician’s character is representative of the character of the country as a whole, Franko said.
“We’re here to fight,” Franko said. “We’ll die, but we’ll keep fighting.”

Content warning: This article contains references to bipolar disorder 
In the theatre world, it’s somewhat of a commandment that there are no small roles. This has never been truer than with Musical Theater Repertory’s production of “Next to Normal” — although its cast is comprised of only six people, it took dozens working behind the scenes to bring it to life.
An independent theater company at USC, MTR showcases student-run productions every semester. Its latest venture, a production of the 2009 American rock musical, premiered Thursday at Massman Theatre.
At the tail end of a five-week rehearsal process, MTR board members and crew heads began planning the show in December. Production manager Erica Ammerman, a junior majoring in theatre, said audiences often don’t realize how much behind-the-scenes work goes into a successful stage production.
“Before the actors even walked into the theater, there have been designers there [for] hours upon hours upon hours, up and down ladders, hanging lights, circuiting them, building, painting — and that’s all just as vital to telling the story,” Ammerman said.
“Next to Normal” tells the story of Diana Goodman, a suburban mother whose severe bipolar disorder brings severe hardship to her life and the lives of her family members. The show tackles heavy and meaningful themes of depression, grief, suicide and drug abuse.
The MTR team has worked not only to ensure that the story is told with authenticity and dimension, but that the cast and crew take care of their own mental health throughout production, ​​Nico Fife, the director of the production, said.
“It was one of the priorities of not only myself, but my assistant director and my music directors, that we never wanted the performers, the designers or anyone working on this to go to an unsafe place while working,” said Fife, a senior majoring in theatre with an acting emphasis.
Tali Green, the actress playing Diana, said that the attention to team well-being had been a focus since the beginning of the rehearsal process. She also said the cast did a meditative “step-in” at the start of every rehearsal and a “step-out” at the end so that they wouldn’t carry the show’s somber subject matter home with them.
“We’re stepping into the show, we’re stepping into our characters and, at the end, no matter what happens — what text we covered, what scenes we blocked, what happened — we can step out and separate our lives from the characters’ lives so that we’re not going home feeling sad and emotional,” said Green,  a senior majoring in theatre.
To help the cast and crew gain a deeper understanding of the show’s narrative, MTR brought on Emiko Ohta, a freshman majoring in cognitive science and theatre with an acting emphasis, as their dramaturge. In their dramaturge role, Ohta conducted outside research and helped answer the cast and crew contextual, historical or thematic questions about the script.
“It’s a lot of researching and collaboration,” Ohta said. “It’s a lot of being inquisitive all the time and taking a really deep look into the script, songs and themes of the show, and really breaking it down bit by bit to make sure whatever we put on is the most authentic, real and engaging to the audience and actors.”
Ohta also said the team planned to include an audience dramaturgy packet to offer a condensed version of the research conducted during the rehearsal process, as well as resources and references connected to the show’s topics.
The technical aspects of “Next to Normal” also play a part in delivering its emotional message. Jacob Hollens, the show’s lighting designer, said they spent time reflecting on the representation of  different characters through colored lighting.
“[The] colors I’ve chosen have very specific intentions,” said Hollens, a freshman majoring in theatre design. “Oftentimes, you’ll see a repetition of a certain color and a certain theme, and it’s supposed to match with each different element that I’m trying to emphasize in a certain song.”
But the road to opening wasn’t without its bumps: one actor took a leave of absence during the rehearsal process and was replaced by Ryan Myers, a senior majoring in theatre. Despite having less than two weeks to learn his part, Myers rose to the challenge, learning all of his lines, music and blocking and developing chemistry with his fellow actors, Fife said.
Because “Next to Normal” is Fife’s directorial debut, he said he went in with an expectation of what the show would be and has faced difficulty accepting technical roadblocks that challenged his initial vision. Ultimately, he said the final product did not meet what he imagined — it exceeded it.
“What I thought the show was going to be three months ago when I first pitched it and we were putting together the team, is nothing like what the show is going to be when it opens, but in the best way,” Fife said. “It is infinitely better than I could have imagined and the team has brought so much new life to it.”
“Next to Normal” has four remaining showtimes: Friday at 10:30 p.m., Saturday at 8 p.m. and both Saturday and Sunday at 2:30 p.m.

A live-action Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken is coming out in 2023. Although I’m excited about the new adaptation, seeing the news brought me back to my childhood, specifically the Barbie animated films of the 2000s. For me, those films possess the Barbie I care about the most: the nostalgic Barbie of fairytales. 
After all, how many sick days did I spend watching “Barbie Mariposa and her Butterfly Fairy Friends” at home, marveling at pretty fairy dresses with a pot of chicken soup? How often did I dress up as Barbie in “Barbie of Swan Lake” or “Barbie in the Twelve Dancing Princesses,” wanting to be Barbie herself?
The old Barbie films occupy a particular space in the cultural consciousness, especially for those who, like me, grew up watching them. Go on YouTube and you’ll find video compilations of the iconic villain Preminger from “Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper,” or the best sassy moments from “Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus.” 
Even as the animation of the Barbie films has drastically improved over the years, the transition to more contemporary settings has meant that we no longer get the fairytale that inspired the original movies. Mattel, the toy company that created Barbie and her associated entertainment, has shown its ability to adapt with its new takes on popular originals (see: “Barbie: The Princess & the Popstar”). Yet, I’d argue that the Barbie movies of the aughts captured a certain experience of growing up that the current Barbie movies don’t, or at least not as effectively. 
When it comes to feeling this way, I’m not alone. According to a Buzzfeed article by Sara Thompson, those Barbie movies, such as “Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses” and the “Barbie: Fairytopia” series, constitute much of the media that represents “2000s girl culture.” It’s evidence that, for many, the old Barbie animated films have contributed to some sense of identity formation. (Even if that’s not true for you, they do serve as a time capsule for the past.) 
In light of that, fans met the changes made to more recent Barbie movies with anger and disappointment. In a lukewarm IMDb review for the 2013 film “Barbie Mariposa and The Fairy Princess,” user @ninjathesecond writes, “For some reason 2 years ago Mattel changed and created a modernised Barbie and it became all about laptops, the internet, web blogs etc.” The user goes on to comment that the company has chosen to “shove” in whatever’s popular and that it would be more beneficial to emphasize “old school Barbie.”
A Change.org petition started by Sidra Khan titled “Bring Barbie Movies Back To Their Original Standards” has reached nearly 1,000 signatures so far and states that “the more recent movies have lost their charm” and that the plots of these movies have become “basic.” 
“We need the old Barbie back,” the petition rightfully concludes.
Considering the fact that Barbie’s intended as a role model for young girls, the original Barbie movies did have a substantial impact in terms of how they redefined femininity. In an article for Rappler, Mikaela de Castro dissects individual Barbie movies for their “empowering” messages. 
De Castro analyzes how “Barbie as Rapunzel” shows Barbie breaking free from her oppressor and how “Barbie as the Island Princess” embraces what it means to be different. It’s obvious that, as de Castro writes, inserting Barbie into previously patriarchal fantasy settings allowed Barbie to rebel against those norms and become incredibly iconic.
I echo others’ thoughts in wishing that, instead of doing modern stories, Barbie should go back to her classic fairytale roots. Even as we appreciate the merits of old Barbie, though, it has to be said that I’m not advocating for a return to the old style of animation. Technology has progressed, and I’m sure most people would rather watch a nicely fleshed-out Barbie than the comparatively stiff block from the past. 
It’s worth noting that sometimes the allure of the old Barbie movies is derived entirely from nostalgia. For those who grew up during the 2000s, the Barbie movies may well have been a fundamental part of our childhoods that we can’t possibly recreate now as we’re older.
Yet the Barbie films of old resonated with many as they showed us a new kind of “happily ever after:” staying true to tradition while still having agency over the narrative. “Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper” had the most memorable, truly Broadway-quality soundtrack of all time, and likewise, I still remember much of the music of the past films, even now. There’s a lot of gold to be found in mining beloved stories and retelling them in inspired ways that don’t necessarily rely on what’s hot at the moment.
As the evolution of the Barbie movies shows, a film doesn’t necessarily need microphones to amplify its magic. Nostalgia can have its own stage.

With movie studios constantly churning out remakes, prequels and sequels, it seems hard to justify making yet another version of a classic story (we are looking at you “Cinderella” and Camila Cabello). But in “The Batman,” director Matt Reeves decides to take the extensively used story of Bruce Wayne in an entirely new direction. 
What Reeves does in this new Batman is entirely novel from previous versions. He takes a deeper dive into the character that is Wayne. We learn about his past, his frailties and his struggles as we see him start to evolve into the more established character we’ve seen in previous films.
But this Batman film also lets audiences meet a new face. Reports state that Ben Affleck was exhausted by the filming of “Justice League” — or perhaps he’s spending more time with Jennifer Lopez. Nonetheless, he decided not to reprise the role of Batman, leaving the door open for a new actor to take his place. So, in walked Robert Pattinson a perhaps unexpected choice but one that proves to pay out as Pattinson takes on the role and makes it entirely his own. 
In contrast to Affleck or Bale or Keaton, Pattinson is less muscle and more brain. In a roundtable interview with the cast and crew held over Zoom Feb. 17, Pattinson reflected on his experience playing a more sensible, conflicted version of Batman.
“It makes him more interesting to play in a lot of ways,” Pattinson said. “He’s just a man in an armored suit.” 
Reeves chose to focus more on the detective side of Batman as we see him follow clues to unmask sadistic masked killer the Riddler (Paul Dano). Pattinson’s character is soon joined by an enigmatic and stray cat loving Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz). Together, they make a breathtaking dynamic duo, complementing each other and adding some cheek to their serious roles.
When asked about how Pattinson and Kravitz created good chemistry on screen, both actors said they believe it came down to each other’s work ethic and motivation. 
“To have another performer you can really see is putting everything into it, it’s a reflective experience,” Pattinson said “It makes you want to work harder.” 
The movie nostalgically recalls 70s’ neo-noir film in terms of style and cinematography, which Reeves admitted heavily influenced the style in which he chose to direct. 
“It’s kind of like ‘All The President’s Men,’ and there’s a bit of ‘French Connection,’ there’s a bit of ‘Taxi Driver,’” Reeves said. “There are a lot of those ’70s movies that, to me, are the movies that really inspired me to want to make movies in the first place.”
The cinematography, in particular, is a sight to behold. Fans of “Dune” will enjoy cinematographer Greig Fraser’s work as he builds the city of Gotham into more than just a background setting, but into palpable energy that keeps us just as much on our toes as the plot. 
Batman’s actions may respond to the Riddler, but their relationship is less straightforward, as are the motivations behind the antagonist’s actions. In “The Batman,” the Riddler first attempts to portray himself as an ally to Batman and demonstrate their ideological similarities, before taking things a bit too far. 
“There’s more murkiness to the morality; it’s less just hero and villain and black and white,” Dano said. “It’s really complicated to have a villain who, some of his ideas are not wrong, maybe the execution is a little off.” 
To help viewers understand the characters’ experience, composer  Michael Giacchino’s pulsating and incredible score underlies the entire film and adds an extra element of urgency behind characters actions. 
“The sound and the music are both totally critical,” Reeves said. “That was really the intention, to make sure you felt the visceral quality of the film, that the film felt subjective.” 
Beyond the cinematic choices, the themes found in “The Batman” allude to ideas and issues occurring outside of Gotham, such as people’s perception of government and the ability for government to change. 
While focused on the corruption in Gotham, it also serves as commentary on the state of our current government – how the people in charge use their power and if a transition of power to a younger generation is possible. The homogeneity of leaders present in Gotham’s government, our government and governments of Gothams past is eerily similar, which Reeves makes a point to expose in his film. 
“The Batman” arrives at a time when trust in the government to function properly is perhaps at an all-time low, and Reeves explores how best to change that trust. Do we succumb to a never ending cycle of corruption? Should we waste our time prosecuting the wrongdoers of the past? Or do we make ourselves vulnerable by pursuing the possibility of change? Regardless, vengeance, indeed, does not change the past. 
“The Batman” explores the conflict and relationship between the man and the mask, yet does so in an obscure, stunning and completely irresistible way. As John Turturro, who plays mob boss Carmine Falcone in the film, points out, “lots of people have something that they hide behind.” It could be a leather mask or simply a smile. The real question is who in the end becomes the real person, the  masked version or the one behind it.

On Feb. 18, USC announced that weekly surveillance testing would no longer be required for vaccinated individuals starting March 1. The University also reversed the “no-guest” policy, allowing guests who are current USC students in residence halls and the outdoor masking requirement was lifted on Feb. 16. 
With coronavirus protocols fading away, the question of “are we going back to normal?” surely enters people’s minds. The pandemic has taken countless lives, affected people’s livelihoods and greatly taxed the mental health of many, so it is understandable why many are so ready to close this dark chapter. 
The pandemic, which is still very much happening, has forever impacted our view and understanding of multiple aspects of society, changing what the new normal may look like. 
For the past two years, students had their fair share of fully remote and hybrid classes. Even with the lifted restrictions, virtual course options at USC will likely stick around as online learning becomes more normalized and, for some students, the preferred option. 
Regardless of preference, the pandemic encouraged students to work in a remote environment. It also emphasized the importance of digital literacy skills for both students and faculty, which is essential in the 21st century. 
The University also increased the number of mental health services for students and faculty in response to the pandemic’s impact on the mental health of students. Throughout the past two years, USC has added 50 new faculty members and increased its range of services to include individual therapy, group therapy, crisis support, psychiatric services and specialties for gender-based harm. These services will continue to benefit students even as we shift back to a semblance of normalcy as mental health issues extend far beyond the pandemic. 
The workplace is another realm impacted by the pandemic. Like schools, most non-essential jobs switched over to a remote medium. After operating in these conditions for nearly two years, some companies are more inclined to implement a long-term hybrid approach to the workplace. According to a global survey conducted by Slack in October 2020, they found that about 12% never wish to return to previous ways of work and 72% prefer a hybrid model. 
As a result of the shifted work modality, virtual job opportunities are rising. On campus, many non-essential work-study jobs are virtual, especially ones that focus on social media, graphic design or writing services. This past fall semester, the work-study job fair itself was virtual, as it has been for the past two years now. Virtual jobs for students are helpful because it eliminates the time of commuting to the location and also allows students to work from anywhere. These remote work-study opportunities will and should continue to be offered even as coronavirus protocols drop. 
As positive cases decrease and protocols continue to lift, it’s important to remember that the pandemic’s impact remains. The college experience and the feasibility of virtual learning and working have changed with various societal realms and roles altered significantly.
So, what to do? 
Adapt. If a professor is unwilling to provide a virtual option, ask them to reconsider, citing the benefits and comforts certain students may feel in that medium. With most students back on campus, take advantage of the numerous campus events, explore Los Angeles or even just study at the library. After being isolated for nearly two years, students must take advantage of their time wisely. Don’t try to return to whatever normal was for you in 2019. Adapt, change and create a new normal.

There is no shortage of ramifications for this Saturday’s primetime, men’s basketball season finale against rival No. 17 UCLA at Pauley Pavilion. The winner will earn the No. 2 seed in the Pac-12 Tournament and an all-important Quad 1 victory eight days ahead of Selection Sunday. 
“We’re going to bring our A-game Saturday night and, hopefully, get some momentum going into the two tournaments,” said senior guard Drew Peterson in an interview after practice.  
The Bruins’ Head Coach Mick Cronin will seek his first victory over USC in his three years with UCLA. Andy Enfield, USC’s leading man, has had Cronin’s number through the years, looking to extend the Trojan’s five-game winning streak over their crosstown rival. 
No. 16 USC comes off 40 minutes of basketball it would rather forget: No. 2 Arizona showed why it deserved its ranking, putting on an offensive clinic against the Trojans’ normally potent defense.
“If you play as poorly as we did, you have to learn something from that,” Enfield said. “The players had to realize what they did wrong … That was not the same thing we’ve been all season, it was disappointing.”
Five Wildcats scored in the double digits, and the team shot an astounding 48% from three. 
“Arizona was definitely a wake up call for us,” junior guard Ethan Anderson said. “We needed that game in order to really spark us and focus right going into March.” 
The Bruins shook off their 68-63 loss at Oregon with comfortable road wins over Oregon State and Washington. All five starters scored in double digits against the Beavers. Junior guard Jaime Jaquez Jr. had 30 points in the Washington game. If recent momentum is a factor in Saturday’s game, UCLA has the advantage. 
Junior guard and leading scorer Johnny Juzang is currently “50-50” to play in the game, Cronin said. A consistent bucket-getter, Juzang has missed the past two games for the Bruins.
Playing in the comfort of its own home has proved a recipe of success for UCLA. It has only lost one home game, an 84-81 overtime loss to the Ducks without fans. It was at home that the Bruins dismantled the Wildcats, holding them to just 59 points.
UCLA also has an impressive early season victory against now No. 11 Villanova. A presumably rowdy crowd could bring momentum for the Bruins. 
“They want to win really bad,” Peterson said. “We’re going to come out hungry and look to continue that win streak.”
The good news for Trojan fans is USC’s success as a road team, with losses only to Arizona and Stanford. 
Additionally, USC played one of its best games against the Bruins early this season, even without the presence of junior forward and leading scorer Isaiah Mobley. 
“It’s going to be awesome,” Peterson said. “Isaiah Mobley is such a big part of our team so we’re going to be really confident and energized for a primetime game on Saturday night.”
Tip off is 7 p.m.

LeBron James all but confirmed that the Los Angeles Lakers season was over Tuesday night as his Lakers fell to 3-7 in their last 10 games, and ninth in the Western Conference.
He didn’t say it with his words, but, instead, with his actions. He even gave the media the common professional athlete vernacular, assuring his belief that the team isn’t done just yet. 
“We still have games to play,” said LeBron after their loss to the Dallas Mavericks. “Until you stomp me out, cut my head off, bury me 12 feet under, then I got a chance. So that’s my confidence.”
Although LeBron says all the right things to the media, a significant weakness in his game has loomed over his team during the past week, one that signals his wavering belief in the Lakers: his body language. 
It’s almost entertaining how much LeBron can’t hide his disdain toward the situation he’s in, despite his involvement in getting himself there. It’s the smallest of details, ones that you’ll really only catch if you key in on LeBron throughout the game. 
Countless times in the Lakers’ recent matchup against the Mavericks, LeBron would drop his shoulders after a missed shot by a teammate, almost as if to sigh in frustration, before jogging down the floor to get back on defense. 
After an opponent made a basket, LeBron would repeatedly throw his hands in the air and give his teammates the stink eye before inbounding the ball. 
This isn’t new with LeBron. His body language has always been demonstratively negative, going back to his days in Cleveland and Miami. He knows it, too — he just can’t help himself. 
“My whole career — and it’s going to end like this — they are going to say that my facial expressions and my body language, could have been better, was terrible “I apologize to all my teammates and coaching staffs,” said LeBron in a cameo on Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye’s “Road Trippin” podcast in 2020. “But they know who I am, and they know, at the end of the day, they can give me the same treatment.”
It might just be a built-in trait for these ultra-competitive, era-defining talents. There is nothing they hate more than losing, and when you’re at the top, it’s hard to not hold everyone to your standard. 
The greatest players are not always the greatest teammates. Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan would drag their teammates through the mud vocally. LeBron may not take the same direct approach, but his body language speaks for him.
It’s never been a huge issue for past teams because LeBron-led teams usually find ways to win games, and his body language becomes more imminent during losses. This Lakers team loses a lot though, even finding creative ways to throw games in the final minutes. 
The problem with LeBron justifying his poor body language by saying that his teammates can give him “the same treatment” is that he’s the leader of this team. He’s the guy that sets the tone because he’s the best player, and when your best player is pouting and sulking, it is demoralizing for teammates — a chemistry and morale killer. 
It seems that fate has started to settle in for LeBron. He realizes that this Lakers team just isn’t that good, ingrained with problems even he can’t fix. 
And, I get it. He is 37 years old, still held to GOAT-level standards, averaging the third most points and fourth most minutes in the league.
His running mate, Anthony “Day-to-Davis,” seems to have a lower body made of glass. Russell Westbrook can’t throw a rock into the ocean, and the coaching staff has shown a clear inability to put their players in a position to succeed.
Not to mention, LeBron isn’t healthy, dealing with a knee injury that kept him out of five straight games in February. He can still go through the motions and get 25 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists on any given night, because that’s how good he is. 
But when that 25-5-5 statline is paired with 10 low-effort attempts to get back on defense and 15 glares at teammates after made-baskets, it’s not a recipe for success. 
LeBron is the leader, and if you’re going to take the praise, sometimes you have to take the blame too. Right now, LeBron is quitting on the Lakers.

President Joe Biden gave his first State of the Union address Tuesday. In the wake of war in Ukraine, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and rampant inflation, many Americans hoped for a rousing speech: one with political insight and a unifying message. Biden, not exactly known as a great orator, failed to completely hit the mark. Nonetheless, it still generated plenty of optimism for many Americans.
Beginning on a strong note, Biden condemned Putin and his “menacing ways,” along with expressing his deep admiration for the Ukrainian people. The room burst into bipartisan standing ovations after seemingly every new announcement he made about the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis — whether it was the decision to ban Russian flights from American airspace, the global plans to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves or the general commitment to “inflict pain” on Russia. Biden also criticized the crimes of Russian oligarchs, promising them that “we are coming for your ill-begotten gains.”
Overall, Biden’s message had all the typical themes you would expect. Frequent was the contrast posed between the West and Russia, with the conflict also framed as being between “democracy and autocracy,” freedom and tyranny, and light and darkness. Each of these comparisons enjoyed bipartisan applause from the audience.
But, of course, some degree of a “rally around the flag” effect is always inevitable. During wartime, patriotic rhetoric is difficult to mess up in the United States. The numerous areas that Biden stumbled in came throughout the rest of the address. For all the talk recently about “unprecedented times,” the vast majority of this speech and Biden’s ideas specifically were precedented. Rather than explicate any upcoming policy, Biden seemed more intent to play it safe, focusing primarily on highlighting past successes and reaching across the aisle towards Republicans on uncontroversial, common grounds.
Indeed, largely straying away from any technocratic specifics, Biden’s policies hardly seemed comprehensive throughout the speech. Inflation was only briefly discussed and, despite it being a direct responsibility of the Federal Reserve, Biden pinned the blame almost entirely on two other factors: corporations needing to “lower costs’’ and  “global supply chain issues’’ — if you couldn’t have guessed that one. Astonishingly, there was zero mention of federal interest rates. 
Biden then delved into a tangent reminiscent of former President Donald Trump as he repeatedly stressed the importance of American manufacturing while also vowing to “level the playing field with China.” In discussing domestic issues, meanwhile, concerns about student loan debt were omitted entirely. Biden then rejected progressive aims even further by proclaiming that “the answer [to neighborhood unrest and racial injustice] is not to defund the police. It’s to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them!” Immediately after — as if to remind Democrats again that he’s still on their side — Biden followed up this declaration with challenges for Congress to pass bills restricting gun ownership and protecting voting rights. 
To be clear, plenty of the speech’s promises — especially the guarantee to cap insulin prices — were genuinely good. But Biden’s ideas lacked a certain ideological cohesiveness. Now, Biden’s appeal was admittedly never really meant to be about his platform. He’s always preferred to sell himself on his character and as him being a “return to normalcy.” In the Democratic primaries, he was the “most electable” candidate. In the general election, he was “not Donald Trump.” Now of course, the fact that a president who prides himself on being likable is so widely disliked is a long discussion itself. But what’s more important to acknowledge here is how the flaws of Biden’s address perfectly encapsulate the shortcomings of his administration.
For many Americans, Biden was meant to bring stability. Yet, the pandemic lingers even now. The inflation surge, dubbed as being “tertiary,” hit a 40-year high last month at a 7.5% annual rate. The prices of gas and higher education stand out particularly as abject absurdity, and, while it still remains deeply unlikely, the world is likely closer to World War III than it has been in decades. It’s hard not to blame Biden somewhat for these issues.
Ultimately, in the address, Biden undeniably came across as competent. The speech did the job. As far as the Ukraine crisis, Biden even did well — American exceptionalism seems to live on. But we as a country needed to see more. Americans needed Biden to prove himself a man of ingenuity, toughness and principle. Americans needed to see the true leader of the free world. Instead, Americans saw Biden as who he realistically is: a manufactured politician. Sure, from the start, Biden’s platform has always been curated down to the last iota, with each bullet point selectively highlighted based on popularity and each decision deliberately chosen for the path of least resistance. But the State of the Union, like Biden’s presidency itself, could and should have been something different, something more. 
In the end, the speech may have qualmed some worries, as we are certainly returning to something of a status quo. But more than anything, Biden reminded us that American politics will always dwell within this game of strategic compromise — the bleak reality where the moderate will always rule, where consistency is excess baggage and where any profound convictions are irrelevant. So Biden brought back normalcy after all.

No. 21 women’s tennis will look to get back on the win column this weekend as they travel for a match against Utah Friday afternoon, followed by Colorado Sunday morning. 
The Trojans come off consecutive losses last weekend against crosstown rival UCLA and UC Santa Barbara. Overall, the team has a 6-6 record on the season and is currently on a five-match losing streak with only one win in February. 
ITA’s most recent rankings saw USC fall nine spots down to No. 21 due to the recent stretch of losses. 
Team captain and senior Danielle Willson highlighted the team’s mentality going into the two-match trip. 
“It’s easy to have a negative mindset especially, after a losing streak,” Willson said. “Right now, we’re taking these losses just trying to make us stronger and as fuel in the fire.”
The Trojans got off to a sluggish start against the Bruins. The duo of senior Salma Ewing and redshirt freshman Snow Han lost to freshman Ava Catanzarite and junior Abbey Forbes. USC ultimately lost the doubles point.  
The team never got on track heading into the singles matches, as the only point scored by the Trojans would come from Han’s victory over junior Sasha Vagramov. 
Slow starts have become a common theme for USC during its five-match skid. It has surrendered the doubles point in each of its losses.
“As a team, we really want that doubles point, and we’ve been working really hard in practice to try and keep improving,” Willson said. “We know we’re all capable of winning those doubles points.” 
Although they suffered defeat in their match against the Gauchos last Saturday, the Trojans showed a valiant effort in the 4-3 loss. Going into the singles matches down the doubles point, Han and Ewing won their respective matchups to make the score 3-2 in favor of the Gauchos. 
However, UCSB sealed the match point after freshman Amelia Honer defeated freshman Sloane Morra. Sophomore Eryn Cayetano defeated Gaucho senior Shakhnoza Khatamova to ultimately make the final score 4-3. 
Willson said she believes the team took something out of this close loss and hopes it can build off the momentum. 
“It’s always important even if you lose to name one positive thing that happened,” Willson said. “Even the resiliency of [Cayetano] getting that win showed leadership and the importance of being resilient no matter what position you’re in.” 
Although the latter half of February was a rough stretch for the Trojans, there have been bright spots for the team. 
Han and Ewing are currently 9-5 and sit at No. 19 on ITA’s recent doubles rankings. They are also performing well individually, with Han currently holding a 21-7 record and ranked No. 56 on ITA’s singles. Ewing is having a solid season, with a 12-9 overall record and No. 36 ranking. 
This week, USC will play a Utah team that has been on a tear. The Utes are currently 11-1 and shut out their last two opponents. Their only loss this season was a close 4-3 defeat against Denver. 
“Our mindset is treating each team like they are any other team,” Willson said. “It can be the number one team in the nation … Everyone is beatable out there.”
The Trojans will then travel to Boulder, Colo. to match up with the Buffaloes who currently ride a four-match win streak.  
USC will look to get back to its winning ways that saw them win its first five matches back in January. 
The team is set to square off against the Utes in Salt Lake City at 12:30 p.m. on Friday and 9 a.m. against Colorado Sunday.
