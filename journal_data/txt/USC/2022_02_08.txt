When Hailey Irwin was a freshman in 2019, she sought out mental health services at USC. USC Student Health told her that in order to get weekly services, she would have to enter into a lottery system and that she should look for off-campus help. Because Irwin did not have her own transportation, she decided to hold off until the following year. 
Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the University increased its mental health services by recruiting 50 new faculty members in 2020 and broadening the types of counseling services offered. According to the Counseling and Mental Health website, USC offers individual therapy, group therapy, crisis support, psychiatric services and specialties for gender-based harm.
The demand for mental health services since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 increased throughout the nation as well. The New York Times wrote that nine out of 10 therapists surveyed said there is a rise in the number of clients seeking help, and that most of the 1,320 therapists surveyed said they experienced difficulty meeting patient demands.
In a Feb. 1 health briefing, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said she and her colleagues saw a rise in students seeking services over the course of the coronavirus pandemic. She said that, in turn, the University increased counseling and mental health staff.
“We do know a number of students who do struggle with the requirements for isolation, so we try to support those students as well. That’s difficult,” Van Orman said. “As we’re coming out of it, I think people have the lingering effects of that, particularly this last wave that I think caught people by surprise.”
Irwin, a junior majoring in geodesign, said she found the University improved its services since she first sought them out, especially throughout the pandemic. 
“Freshman year was a lot more challenging because it was all in-person. There was no COVID, and they didn’t have the required staff to do it,” Irwin said. “My sophomore year, when I sought out help, it was a lot easier to get a daily or weekly person just because there was not the demand.”
During the 2020-2021 school year, the University’s mental health services were only accessible to people living in California because all appointments were virtual. Irwin received help during this time as a California resident and said she believes the services met her demand.
Sophia Hilsabeck, a senior majoring in public policy, began using USC’s mental health services a year ago. She said her experience using the services was a positive one, and she felt lucky with the therapist she received.
For individual therapy, students can sign up for a limited number of sessions with a counselor, after which Student Health assists them in finding a therapist that takes the students’ insurance. 
Hilsabeck began therapy sessions in Spring 2021, but decided to take a break at the end of the semester once her free sessions were over. Hilsabeck said her therapist told her if she wanted to return to therapy in future semesters, she could send a message through MySHR to a therapist for short-term treatment. 
Hilsabeck said Student Health gave her a list of therapists to contact who related to what she was looking for under her insurance. She said finding the right off-campus therapist was a “daunting” task. 
“I wanted ideally a person of color or one of the women, so [Student Health] kind of took that into account, took my insurance into account, my location and then, they gave me a list of maybe six or so either people or groups to reach out to, so I had to reach out on my own, and then you’re kind of stressed,” Hilsabeck said. 
When scheduling her initial appointment, Anne Whelan, a sophomore majoring in computer science and physics, found the Student Health website to be confusing. She recently began using the University’s mental health services and said it has been a positive experience so far. However, she said she would have started using the services earlier had she been able to navigate the website.
“They don’t really list out the appointments, so it was kind of difficult in that sense, it’s not immediate. You do have to call the number instead, which it was honestly fine,” Whelan said. “It was very simple scheduling an appointment, but you don’t really get to choose whoever; they just give one for you.”
Though he had a positive experience with USC’s mental health services, Robert Scalia, a senior majoring in international relations, said there are not enough student resources related to sexual assault.
“If someone’s been sexually assaulted, it’s not enough to just have mental health services. There also needs to be something like rape kits on campus or some sort of rape trauma center on campus,” Scalia said. “I think that their mental health has been accessible for me, but I think that they’re lacking other resources to support that mental health work.” 
Scalia also said there should be more advertising for Student Health services, especially in classrooms. Most professors include resources that are offered through the University at the end of syllabi, but Scalia said he believes it would be beneficial for professors to discuss those resources in-depth.
Despite these difficulties, Hilsabeck is “grateful” for her experience with the University’s mental health services, and said she would have stayed if not for the session limit. 
“It takes two or three weeks to find someone,” Hilsabeck said. “By the time you get to know them, they’re like, ‘Okay it’s time to move on.’ That part is kind of hard.”

When Katie Grant was younger, she recalls driving past the NASA Ames Research Center and wanting to know how she could end up working there. Now a graduate student intern at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a doctoral student studying earth sciences, Grant discussed the benefits of bridging imaging spectroscopy and biogeochemistry in Earth system observations and scaling Earth’s terrain in her webinar, “A Field Guide to Earth System Observation: Hyperspectral Remote Sensing and the Critical Zone” Monday.
In the presentation hosted by the STEM Bytes Seminar and moderated by the Women in Science and Engineering program, Grant explained Earth system observations, a composition of research that uses geological and atmospheric data to analyze the effects of climate change on different environments. Grant said the Earth system observation of the Earth’s critical zone, an almost-surface level layer of the Earth’s crust that indicates the quality of essential resources — including food production and water — gives scientists the opportunity to observe, scale and classify large regions of land.
“That’s kind of the take-home benefit of my research,” said Grant in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Challenges embedded in those benefits are spatially scaling ground truth data and imaging spectroscopy to say something about the larger region. I think we’ve come a very long way as the scientific community to overcome those challenges, yet they do still exist in some capacity.”
 The presentation started with background information on remote sensing and the visible to shortwave infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In practice, remote sensing reveals different cover types of the Earth’s surface — each with a unique spectral signature.
“We’ve barely begun to tap the surface and say something about the subsurface of the critical zone,” Grant said. “That’s really what I’m interested in doing is using hyperspectral data that’s remotely sensed data to say something about the subsurface.”
Marie Meneses, a marketing assistant for WiSE, helped moderate the event and invited attendees to ask questions about Grant’s presentation and personal journey through a Q&A session. Meneses said Grant has “a lot of advice and insight” to share. 
WiSE Fellowship recipient Vanessa Rubien came to the presentation to support fellow women in STEM. She said that she “really resonated” with Grant’s experience driving past the Ames Research Center. 
“​​To see her be able to achieve those goals through all of her experiences and her hard work was very inspiring,” said Rubien in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Rubien, a doctoral student studying mechanical engineering, said she attends the STEM Bytes seminars to broaden her horizons and breadth of knowledge in various fields of STEM.
“I have no background with what she does. I’m on the aerospace and engineering side. She’s on the more ecological and biological side, so we’re like completely different ends,” Rubien said. “Her methodology and the databases that they use, there’s a little bit of overlap in that, so that was really cool to see somebody else doing work like that.”
Grant said Dana Chadwick, who Grant worked with at the Carnegie Institution for Science, served as her mentor and idol. Grant said she also praises Gregg Vane, the creator of the imaging spectrometer, for showing that science is also based on human connection.
“Who you have the pleasure of meeting, working with and engaging with all the way through really shapes not only the science but the work environment and so many more things,” Grant said. 
 Grant said her interest in being a speaker stemmed from wanting to connect with the younger generations of Earth scientists.
“I think I came in with the hope that maybe at least one person is interested in the work,” Grant said. “I’m hopefully initiating a conversation in that way and helping empower those students to chase these, or at least try this free area of research and see if they like it, and if they do, continuing helping them learn, grow and advance in their careers.”

“And the Academy Award goes to…” Well, we don’t know yet! 
For those interested in the happenings of Hollywood, the beginning of the year is especially exciting because it means “awards season.” From Screen Actors Guild Awards to Golden Globes to Oscars, film enthusiasts from all around the world keenly tune in to see who the year’s awardees will be. 
On Dec. 21, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced shortlists in 10 categories for the upcoming Academy Awards: Documentary Feature, Documentary Short Subject, International Feature Film, Makeup and Hairstyling, Music (Original Score), Music (Original Song), Animated Short Film, Live Action Short Film, Sound and Visual Effects. While this doesn’t guarantee a nomination, it gives the audience a chance to anticipate what the nominees may be. 
Specifically, the international films give people a chance to move beyond cultural lines and language barriers and connect based on feelings and emotion. Check out these five potential Oscar nominees in the “International Feature Film” category before the ceremony on March 27:
Norway, “The Worst Person in the World” (2021)
Leading actress Renate Reinsve picked up the “Best Actress Award” at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival for her performance in “The Worst Person in the World.” While Reinsve isn’t what the title suggests, her character, Julie, sometimes feels like it as she navigates a complicated and unsure love life. Julie’s emotions and experiences are not uncommon, which is what makes it so relatable to so many people. 
But even if you’re not in your 30s and aren’t stuck in a love triangle between your comic book artist boyfriend and a younger, friendly stranger, there’s something captivating about this film that will make you laugh and cry. As Julie’s other life experiences are unraveled, the audience learns that her problem of being stuck between these two men isn’t as simple as it originally seems. Watch it in select theaters across the United States now. 
Mexico, “Prayers for the Stolen” (2021)
An adaptation from Jennifer Clement’s novel that delivers harsh material in a soft lens, “Prayers for the Stolen” centers on the violent reality of three young girls — main character Ana (Ana Cristina Ordóñez González and Marya Membreño), and her best friends Paula (Camila Gaal and Alejandra Camacho) and María (Blanca Itzel Pérez and Giselle Barrera Sánchez) — as they grow up in a place terrorized by drug cartels. After a young girl from their town goes missing, Ana and Paula must cut their hair and wear boy-ish clothes as protective measures. 
Available on Netflix, the adaptation is an honest reminder of the effects that violence has on people, especially young women, as they navigate normal parts of growing up: getting their period and having crushes. The cinematography is extremely well done, with slow and moving visuals that provide a brilliant contrast with the subject material. 
Italy, “The Hand of God” (2021)
“The Hand of God,” set in Naples in the 1980s, follows an awkward teen and his experiences growing up as he navigates freedom and loss. It’s not a film for everyone – the combination of odd sexual scenes demonstrating the protagonist’s innocent fascination with soccer player Diego Maradona can be off-putting, but director Paolo Sorrentino roots the autobiographical narrative in grief and love, making it feel very personal and intimate.
Navigating lust, friendship and a number of other emotions, the protagonist, Fabietto (Filippo Scotti) is awkward yet charming. Scotti’s acting is brilliant, and powerfully emotional scenes show his range. The soundtrack of this piece stood out a lot, with prominent violin heavy compositions that help frame the artistic scenes. The cinematography is comparable to “Spencer” (2021) which masterfully juxtaposes darker lighting with a lighter color palette. “The Hand of God” is currently available on Netflix.
Iceland, “Lamb” (2021)
Powerhouse production company A24’s “Lamb” is nothing short of unsettling. Is it a horror? Is it a comedy? Answer: It’s both. It’s a funny, weird and sad film that is purely innovative. At its core, it’s a story of parenthood, but it becomes clear that Maria (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason) are not parents to a child but rather a strange animal-human hybrid birthed by an ewe named after their deceased daughter, Ada. It’s a must-watch based on sheer inventiveness, but presenting something completely new and captivating is no stranger to A24. What is so special about this film are the visual effects, which add to the absurdity when the audience finally lays eyes on Ada. By hitting points of grief but also adding horrific moments, the takeaway from “Lamb,” which is on Amazon Prime, is one that each viewer has to discern themselves.
Bhutan, “Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom” (2022)
Bhutan’s official entry to the 94th Academy Awards follows Ugyen, a young school teacher who is assigned to teach in the mountains of Bhutan but aspires to go to Australia instead. With less than 100 residents, Lunana is a remote village in northwestern Bhutan. To get to his classroom, Ugyen has to take an eight-day journey. 
Available in theaters nationwide, the film is heartwarming and illustrates the positive impact that a caring and dedicated teacher can have on the lives of their students. Not only are the children adorable, but their sincere eagerness to learn makes watching the slice-of-life absolutely worthwhile. The vast landscape of Lunana helps create these wide shots that contrast with the intimacy of the town itself. It’s especially monumental because it’s also Bhutan’s first time making it to the Oscar shortlist.

Saba, who performed at Conquest this fall as one of Kenny Beats’ special guests, released his latest project Friday, with features from G Herbo, Smino, 6LACK and more. It’s a stunning piece of work, one which is sure to leave fans and casual listeners satisfied not just with Saba’s meticulous production and flows, but his heartfelt poetry, too.
On his previous album, “CARE FOR ME,” much of the lyrical focus was on his deceased cousin, John Walt, and the survivor’s guilt Saba felt following the fatal stabbing that took Walt’s life. He poured raw emotion into that album’s composition, detailing his intimate relationship with Walt over gorgeous horn and percussion sections in the song, “PROM / KING,” a seven-minute track that guided his audience through their intersecting upbringings.
After “CARE FOR ME” was positively received by critics and fans, many wondered how he could follow up such a powerful and tender album. Enter “Few Good Things,” an album focusing on Saba’s life since his cousin’s death, his postalbum success and healing through the emotional struggles he’s faced. It’s the story of Saba realizing that the values he idolized as a child are flawed and that there’s more to life than making money and getting famous. 
One topic which has always shined through Saba’s life and work is his connection to his home city, Chicago. In the song “Survivor’s Guilt,” he goes more into detail about life in the Windy City, his feelings surrounding Walt’s murder and even brings in Chicago rap star G Herbo to share his perspective on Chicago life.
In the track’s verses, he also expands upon themes of family, rapping, “My father told me that the world was mine and I believed him / My momma said I was a heathen … My grandpa smilin’ with no teeth in, my cousin still supposed to be h-.” His reminiscence on his connection to family through life ends with a sharp, poignant cutoff after he mentions that his cousin is “still supposed to be here.” The moment is one of many sprinkled throughout the album that reveal he hasn’t forgotten the pain, but has learned to acknowledge and move beyond it, as he has with many other obstacles life has thrown his way.
On the criminally short “An Interlude Called ‘Circus,’” Saba and Eryn Allen Kane float over a gorgeous track, reminiscing on Saba’s youth and reflecting on his newfound maturity. Most candidly, in the chorus, Saba sings “Ayy, we never say ‘Goodbye,’ no ‘See you ‘round,’ no ‘See you later’ / Ayy, this Chicago, when you leave, we say ‘Be safe’ here.” In just one minute, he paints a gorgeous picture of growing up carefree in the city but also highlights the underlying sense of worry he was forced to endure due to the city’s violence.
Saba then enters his melodic rap pocket — an example of this album’s diverse sonic range — in his songs “Still,” featuring 6LACK and Smino, and “A Simpler Time,” featuring Mereba. The pair of tracks flash forward to a much different part of his life, where he enjoys living and feels content with the work he’s put into bettering himself and his craft. That pride and satisfaction shines through in the work, leaving listeners coming away with the same sense of confidence he exudes. His artistic versatility allows him to effortlessly ease artists of other genres into these tracks while preserving topical and sonic focus.
These are the highlights in the tracklist, but that isn’t to say “Few Good Things” has few good tracks — rather, the shining moments are connected by a score of solid, supporting numbers. Like a composer writing a musical, Saba began with the album’s story and filled every moment of that narrative with song, and succeeded in making it a consistently polished experience. Along with these solid tracks, he also includes some fun and braggadocious moments of brevity, like his song, “Stop That,” which he premiered at Conquest and released as a single the same day.
In the final track, “Few Good Things,” featuring Black Thought and Eryn Allen Kane, Saba and Black Thought rap about the doubt they had to overcome when embarking on their music careers. They concur that following one’s dreams comes with criticism and unease from family and friends, rapping about “how they quick to get confused and then disapprove.” Ultimately, after a lifelong journey into maturity, they continue to pursue those dreams and build the mental fortitude needed to make it as artists, even as they find their values changing as they grow.
Overall, this album delves further into Saba’s life and details his growth over the last four years. It’s the story of the young rapper realizing life lessons he hadn’t seen as a boy, or even in the last few years while blossoming into a star. The tracklist serves up feel-good moments, sad times and hard lessons to learn, all woven into a nuanced and endlessly catchy personal narrative. It finds an artist, reflecting on his past and the multitudes of self which make up his present, but that variety is intentional; as Saba said in an Instagram post right before the album’s release, “We are more than one thing all at the same time.”

Dressed in a matching long sleeve top and full-length pinstripe pajama bottoms, drag performer Die Anna personified stardom Thursday night at Redline DTLA. The outfit affirmed their nuanced thoughtfulness when it comes to their performances, as they opened their show as the first performer of the night to Bruno Mars’ 2010 track “The Lazy Song.”
It all made sense.
Die Anna — who is nonbinary trans femme — focuses their show, “Die 4 U,” on the lack of inclusion of transgender and nonbinary people in the drag community. This lack is a subject that many inside and out of the LGBTQIA+ community grapple with in the advent of mass media content like “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”
“​​Since I grew up in the downtown [Los Angeles] drag community, it was always [my] first idea to have kings, queens, everyone in between, brown people, white people, Black people and just go from there — treat a drag show like how it should be treated, like everyone gets a slice of the pie,” Anna said.
These performances sometimes have the benefit of tips, in addition to general performance fees paid to performers by venues who book them. In this context, the act of drag has a monetary incentive that many performers have come to rely on to earn a living. 
However, with the coronavirus pandemic hindering many facets of the entertainment industry, including live shows, performing artists such as Die Anna, whose show initially began online, were able to flourish.
“If I could do it on the internet, I can do it in person,” said Die Anna referring to their remote drag events over the pandemic. “[But] it’ll be even bigger and better, because I get to invite my friends from all over the country who [also participated] in the show online.”
Initially, their idea was simply to find a space to express their creativity, and after a time of searching in vain for what felt like the right place for them, they decided, “if you don’t see yourself reflected in the spaces that you’re in, just get up and do it.”
“It’s way beyond ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race,’” said Die Anna’s event partner, Roxy Johnathan Valle, who goes by Johnny Sin Gentleman or simply “Johnny” for short. “It’s something I had to open my eyes to.” 
Johnny, who identifies as trans masculine nonbinary, recalled his journey to self discovery in the drag community. 
“I [had not heard of] a ‘drag king’ until a friend brought it up [as a phenomenon] in Long Beach at places like Hamburger Mary’s,” Johnny said.
Hamburger Mary’s is a popular chain of restaurants across the United States that revolves around traditional drag performances by cisgender males and, at times, functions as a focal point of visibility for the LGBTQIA+ universe. Many members of the LGBTQIA+ community use such places to introduce their often cisgender heterosexual friends and families to the physical world of drag, Mary’s performer Coco Sho-Nell told them magazine  in 2020.
According to Johnny, for mainstream places like Hamburger Mary’s to feature drag kings as a performance identity, it felt like he found a new route for self-expression as a queer artist. 
“I thought, ‘Holy shit! This is a thing,’” Johnny said. “I started exploring myself and the downtown L.A. scene — there were nonbinary artists, trans feminine people, and gendering bending, just [performers] just doing their own thing, and there wasn’t really a gender identified. It was alternative and artistic.”
Redline DTLA bar owner and founder of Downtown L.A. Pride Festival Oliver Alpuche said ‘alternative and artistic’ forms of creativity are lost when we settle on the complacency of ideals and notions about the LGBTQIA+ community.
“There is so much out there that I don’t know and don’t understand, and [I] have the ability to give people a platform to showcase different genders, different expressions … the amount of performers and people you meet open your eyes up to what gender truly means,” said Alpuche about his bar, which has regularly hosted “Die 4 U” for the past six months.
Alpuche said he wants to continue creating inclusive programming and a space for all members of the drag community at Redline, a show of support he feels, as a cisgender gay man and bar owner, is his responsibility.
“Now we need to elevate that and start bringing in different kind of performances, different aspects [of the LGBTQIA+ community].”
“Die 4 U” runs regularly for the foreseeable future every first Thursday of the month at Redline DTLA. If any of our readers are interested in joining Die Anna’s show, feel free to reach out via their Instagram @yourdeadsister, or simply show up to the next performance of “Die 4 U.”
Correction: In a previous version of this article, we incorrectly identified “Die 4 U” as beginning online. Though Die Anna had hosted events on Zoom, Instagram and Twitch during the pandemic, “Die 4 U” premiered in person. This article was updated to properly reflect the gender identity of Die Anna. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

Who would’ve thought that we’d have two in-person semesters in a row? After those first two weeks of limbo, certainly not me. Oh well, all’s well that ends well.
While we were all figuring out what might happen to this semester, I slowly got myself re-situated with what was going on in the United States You see, for winter break, I went back to my home country. Between each impromptu family gathering, I barely had the time to keep up to date on all matters.
So imagine my surprise when I found out about NFTs. 
For those of you who somehow haven’t seen pictures of these apes, lions, pixel people or whatever other variation exists out there floating around, let me (try to) explain what NFTs are. 
Basically, they are a form of aNon-Fungible Token cryptocurrency. They are a form of crypto money, like Bitcoin, attached to a specific image (hence the drawings). No two NFTs share the same image, hence where the non-fungible AKA not replaceable element comes into play. 
I know that this is very complex. Trust me, it took me a while to understand it too. What’s important for us to know is that they are effectively a form of money tied to a specific picture that only one person can own at a time. Oh, and they also sell for exuberant amounts of money. 
Unsurprisingly, the internet is very divided about them. Some hail them as the future of art and media as we know it, while others talk about the various issues they currently have, such as lack of guarantee, environmental cost or use of someone’s art without consent. 
But one community stands almost overwhelmingly against them: the gaming community.
It doesn’t take a detective to find moments where gaming company actors themselves received extreme backlash after their attempts to introduce NFTs. 
“Worms,” a highly loved video game series that populated many people’s childhoods, completely scrapped its NFT project after being bashed on Twitter by fans. Same thing with popular voice actor Troy Baker, who gave up on launching a partnership with an NFT company after his fans showed to be overwhelmingly against it.  
If you don’t play video games yourself, you might be scratching your head right now. Intuitively, shouldn’t gamers be totally on board for NFTs?
I mean, they’re one of the few demographics that actively consume virtual media and constantly hail it as art, right? So what is the issue?
I asked myself those very same questions when I was browsing through Twitter. And then it hit me: loot boxes.
Very briefly, loot boxes are a system implemented in many games where you can attempt to acquire in-game items by spending in-game currency. And, while some games do it totally for free, a great majority of those who implement the system allow the possibility of buying gaming currency with real-life money, turning it from pretend gambling into the real-life thing. Some go as far as making these attainable items an integral part of the game. 
The most important thing about loot boxes, however, is that gamers absolutely hate them. It’s the same thing with other forms of microtransactions and understandably so. After all, they already paid full price for the game, which is often around $60, only to realize that they must spend even more money to properly enjoy it.
Do you see what I’m getting at here?
When gamers see companies trying to introduce NFTs to their games, all these past experiences instantly play in their heads and their reaction is almost an instant and unanimous “No.” 
They are afraid that if they allow just a few NFTs to be incorporated into video games, companies will get the wrong idea and, in the span of a few months, completely saturate their games with these types of items. Most of these saturated games will certainly make the experience less enjoyable for the great majority of the player base.
So how can we fix it?
Well, if we are dead set on integrating NFTs into games, there really only is one option: Meet your community halfway. The reality is most gamers are simply too distrustful of gaming companies and NFTs in general to give them a try. So as a company, your job is to understand these concerns and, at the same time, shape your product so that people are more likely to consume it.
Take for example 100 Thieves, a famous esports group. To commemorate their recent win at the largest “League of Legends” tournament in North America, they released a series of free NFTs that anyone can claim, making it explicit that their environmental cost is the same as sending two emails. 
Not only is this not interfering with their fanbase accessing their content, but it also serves as a form of a digital “trophy” to commemorate a significant event for people who follow them. By making them free and explicitly addressing their cost, they also avoid any sort of notion that they are doing this for profit or as a scam.
While this column served more as an investigation into the topic, it is worth noting that this is an actively evolving issue. Who knows, maybe tomorrow, I’ll log onto Twitter and see the majority opinion changed because of one topic. 
However, if we plan on following esports from now on, understanding the role NFTs may play in the industry is essential. After all, knowing most gaming companies, they’ll likely jump at the chance to make some quick bucks. 
If that scenario does become a reality and NFTs are suddenly widespread, I hope the knowledge of this column at least allows you to buy a cool monkey faster than your friends.

As the NBA All-Star weekend nears, teams across the NBA continue to mount a challenge and climb up conference standings in anticipation for the playoffs. With injuries, fatigue and scheduling affecting teams in both conferences, Trojans have had strong performances despite extenuating circumstances. 
Guard DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
One of the Eastern Conference’s All-Star starters, DeMar DeRozan continues to perform beyond expectations after the Chicago Bulls signed him in free agency this previous offseason. The Compton native has been averaging 33.3 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game for the last four games. 
Despite losing to the Philadelphia 76ers Sunday, DeRozan overperformed and gave the Bulls a chance. The 13-year veteran put up 45 points, 9 rebounds, 7 assists and a steal on 60% shooting from the field. 
His 45 points were the highest point total this season, and second time he’s scored 40 points.  It was also the most points he’s scored since dropping 52 against the Milwaukee Bucks in 2018.
DeRozan is arguably experiencing one of his best statistical seasons this year. The former Trojan is averaging 27 points per game – his highest since his memorable 2016-17 season where he averaged 27.3 points per game. 
With fellow All-Star Zach LaVine temporarily out of the lineup due to injury and guards Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso out indefinitely with injuries of their own, DeRozan has performed when necessary and continues to build his own case for this year’s Most Valuable Player award. 
Center Nikola Vucevic, Chicago Bulls
With the aforementioned absences in the Chicago Bulls due to hampering injuries, Nikola Vucevic increased his output along with DeRozan in hopes of supporting the Bulls during this period. 
The 11-year Big Man has been averaging a double-double this season, putting up 17.6 points and 11.6 rebounds per game this year, with the points per game total being his lowest average since the 2017-18 season. However, in the last four outings, Vucevic has posted 26.8 points and 13.8 rebounds per game. 
Vucevic’s length, size and versatility proved fruitful in the Bulls’ victory over the Indiana Pacers Friday. The former Trojan put up 36 points, 17 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 blocks on 76% from the field. 
Although suffering a dip in statistical averages across the board compared to previous seasons, Vucevic has experienced a decrease in usage rating percentage. Vucevic’s rate has fallen from 28.2% to 24.2% between last season and this current season. Regardless, he has still come up big for the Bulls amid the increased injuries.  
Guard De’Anthony Melton, Memphis Grizzlies
Operating mainly as a back-up point-guard to Memphis Grizzlies’All-Star Starter Ja Morant, De’Anthony Melton has performed well as a reserve role player. The four-year guard averaged 11.3 points, 5 rebounds and 2 assists in his last three games on a 48% and 50% clip from the field and beyond the arc, respectively.  
Melton posted a double-double in the Grizzlies’ blowout win against the Orlando Magic Saturday, as his 16 points and 10 rebounds in 22 minutes of play proved instrumental in Memphis’ victory. 
He averages 9.9 points, 4.6 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.6 steals per game this season as the Grizzlies have risen up the standings and sit comfortably in third in the West with a 37-18 record. 
Power-Forward/Center Onyeka Okongwu, Atlanta Hawks
Although only averaging 22 minutes per game in the Atlanta Hawks’ star-studded front court, Onyeka Okongwu has managed to impress in the little minutes allocated to him. The NBA sophomore continues to contribute consistent numbers in limited playing time. 
In 22 minutes of action at home against the Los Angeles Lakers, Okongwu had 16 points, 5 rebounds and a steal on 8-9 from shooting to help the Hawks win last Sunday. The victory also added to the Hawks’ seven-game winning streak before losing against the Toronto Raptors the following day. 
His minutes have begun to hover around 20 per game, serving as a backup big man to Clint Capela. However, his chemistry with All-Star guard Trae Young makes him a useful asset on the floor. With Okongwu’s performances, the two-year NBA center will hope to be given more opportunities as the season progresses.

Despite a loss against No. 1 Long Beach State last Friday, No. 7 USC is sitting at 8-2 on the season, one of their best starts in program history.
With a veteran roster led by seniors Chris Hall, Cole Paxson, Brandon Browning and Sam Kobrine, the Trojans’ experience is paying off after one winning season in the last six years. USC’s resume is highlighted by wins over two top-five teams — the Beach and No. 4 Penn State.
If the Trojans want to make a push toward the NCAA tournament, however, a strong finish to the season is key. So, with that, let’s take a look at USC’s five most important remaining matches of the regular season.
At Home vs. No. 8 UC Santa Barbara, Feb. 9
The Trojans come back from their second defeat of the season, welcoming a dangerous UC Santa Barbara team to Galen Center Wednesday. The Gauchos are ranked No. 8 in the Coaches Poll.
After a poor start to the season, including two losses to USC, UCSB has won four straight games, all over Top 12 opponents. During this stretch, the Gauchos have knocked off No. 5 Pepperdine University twice, the Nittany Lions and No. 12 Ohio State. 
Three of those four wins came in four sets or fewer. UCSB comes into the game hot, setting up a matchup with the Trojans that could bring fireworks. 
Away vs. No. 13 Stanford, March 25 and 26
Stanford is a team on a bit of a different trajectory than UC Santa Barbara. After starting off the season 3-0, the Cardinal are 3-3 in their past six games. At the First Point Collegiate Challenge in Austin, Texas this past weekend, Stanford beat Fairleigh Dickinson University in three sets, before falling to no. 1 Hawaii in four sets.
Despite their recent skid, however, USC cannot overlook the Cardinal. They are ranked No. 13 in the Coaches Poll and have a win over UC Irvine on their resume. When you factor in the historical rivalry between the two schools, these two matches against the Cardinal will be critical for the Trojans.
At home vs. No. 11 Brigham Young University, March 4 and 5
When the No. 11 Cougars come to Galen Center for two matches in early March, it will almost certainly be a top ten matchup. BYU currently sit at 5-3 on the season, with all three of its losses coming against top ten teams.
In addition, the Cougars’ resume includes wins over No. 10 Ball State and the Anteaters twice. This should be a big-time series that will tell us a lot about the Trojans’ ability to compete with the country’s elite teams.
Away vs. No. 5 Pepperdine Feb. 23
Pepperdine might very well be the toughest opponent that the Trojans will face all season. Coming in at No. 5, the Waves are currently sitting at 4-2 on the season.
While this record might not appear worthy of their ranking, Pepperdine has looked absolutely dominant in each of its four wins, with all four coming in three sets. In addition, the Waves have only lost to one opponent all season, with both of their losses coming against a red hot Guachos team.
With four more matches against ranked opponents prior to their series with the Trojans, it will be interesting to see how the Waves look when these matches roll around later this month.
Home and away vs. UCLA March 31 and April 2
Not only are these two matches for Los Angeles volleyball bragging rights, but they will also likely have major NCAA tournament implications. The Bruins are ranked No. 2, just five spots ahead of the Trojans. 
With seven NCAA tournament berths up for grabs, these two late-season contests could easily serve as make-or-break matches for both programs.
Historically, UCLA has also been collegiate volleyball’s most dominant program, with 19 NCAA national championships, with its most recent in 2006. If USC wants to make it back to the top of college volleyball and claim the program’s fifth NCAA-recognized national championship (and first since 1990), they will almost certainly have to slay the dragon across town in order to do so.
These two contests will also be revenge matches for senior outside hitter/opposite hitter/setter Kobrine, who transferred from UCLA following the 2021 season. It will be interesting to see what sort of reception Kobrine gets from the Bruin faithful when he returns to Pauley Pavilion for the first time as a rival April 2.

School districts across the nation, especially those in low-income communities, faced severe teacher shortages even before the pandemic. Something about incurring massive debt for a career of backbreaking hours and a heartbreaking lack of respect just doesn’t do it for some. But just when teachers across the United States uttered a collective, “this can’t possibly get worse,” the pandemic brought on a new slew of hurdles.
Safety concerns, difficulties teaching online and constantly changing coronavirus guidelines put undue pressure on teachers to juggle insurmountable requirements for meager pay. During the lockdowns, the many problems work-from-home workers faced — lack of childcare and the threat of a deadly virus, among others — made teaching somehow even more impossible than before. 
More recently, several school districts have begun to tout laxed safety protocols and removed their mask bans, which add a biochemically hazardous spice to the struggles of being a teacher. Unsurprisingly, teachers are leaving their jobs in droves — and can we blame them?
An estimated 800,000 public school teachers quit their jobs between January and November 2021 across the nation. A recent poll conducted by the National Education Association indicates that 55% of current teachers are considering doing the same. 
Where teachers’ unions and politically galvanized school boards couldn’t provide the support needed, TikTok and Instagram stepped up. Social media hashtags like #TeachersLeavingEd and #CareersForTeachers helped teachers find alternative jobs and provided a sense of community considering leaving the profession. Promises of better pay, potential for career growth and better work-life balance have motivated teachers to take jobs in tech, health, sales and more, and many aren’t looking back.
Their ability to communicate new knowledge and long-attested patience make former teachers valuable assets to their new employers. Many note that they are more respected in their new positions, despite finding leaving the classroom emotionally wrenching. 
It looks like the “Best Teacher Ever!” mugs aren’t doing much to secure the sanity of teachers across America. Hearing parents exclaim, “Gosh! I don’t know how you do it!” to the teacher of their kid — who definitely chased the rest of us with scissors — proves my point. How are teachers expected to do it all?
Endless benchmark exams to pressure from parents and superiors are just a few of the challenges teachers must grapple with. Even more so, fault for the institutional failures of the education system unjustifiably falls squarely on teachers’ shoulders. 
Is it really any wonder why fewer and fewer young people want to teach?
While many former teachers have left behind crowded, poorly ventilated classrooms for good, their exodus creates countless ramifications for students. Indeed, the classrooms teachers leave behind are looking increasingly dystopian-war-movie-meets-Sesame Street.
In wake of omicron-driven teacher shortages, desperate school districts got crafty with who they sat behind the desk. Whereas long-retired teachers make logical substitutes, New Mexico’s governor recently announced an initiative to station National Guard members in classrooms to, you know, teach. Further, the issues plaguing America’s education system are even worse when coupled with a growing lack of qualified, consistent teachers.
In California, four in every five school districts face a teacher shortage, with a majority of affected districts representing low-income communities or communities of color. To keep schools open, many districts are certifying unqualified educators.
If these trends continue, we could be looking at perpetuated disparities in the quality of education between affluent communities and those most affected by shortages in the long term. In the Los Angeles Unified School District alone, there are 500 teaching vacancies. The prospects of filling them don’t look too good, as the conditions have not improved — especially considering that more schools are returning to in-person instruction at the height of the Omicron variant.
These issues don’t stop at K-12. Professors across the nation are resigning because their universities refuse to do more to limit the spread of coronavirus. While teachers at the university level aren’t quitting in droves like they are in elementary and secondary education, the lack of vaccination requirements and mask mandates have faculty at higher education institutions concerned.Look, I’m not completely down with the idea of the military descending on our local seventh grade classes to teach English like what occurred in New Mexico earlier this month, nor am I stoked about teachers having to trade their teaching passion for a realistic way to feed their families. This teacher shortage is a grave reflection of our inability to support teachers, the very people who get us where we are today. For every handful of teachers leaving their professions for good, there’s a Rossier student who definitely doesn’t need to hear, “You know what you’re getting into, right?” again — because good teachers truly make a difference.

Words matter. 
Post-colonial is defined as “occurring or existing after the end of colonial rule.” This is not to be confused with the unhyphenated version of the word, “postcolonialism,” which is defined as “the historical period or state of affairs representing the aftermath of  Western colonialism.” Although the word is constructed using the prefix “post,” it does not argue that the effects of colonialism are over. Instead, it concerns itself with understanding how Western colonization shaped the unbalanced dynamics of world power. 
Those effects are visible today within our own student body. The way we speak, dress, eat and understand the world is based on a Western, or more specifically, white understanding of the world, even though many of us are not racially white or of a white ethnic background. USC has made strides to diversify its student body demographics, but the school is still predominantly white. This is not to say USC is responsible for colonization around the world, but rather that it is structured in such a way that it reflects colonialism. 
Postcolonial theory is one way in which we can dissect USC, but the word is prone to misinterpretation. There are words that better describe the issue of colonialism today, such as neocolonialism. 
The word neocolonialism is created by adding the Greek prefix neos, meaning “new,” to colonialism. Neocolonialism means new colonialism, but the definition isn’t so simple. Neocolonialism argues that colonizer countries use economic, cultural and political pressures to control countries, especially those that used to be under their colonial rule. This word is more active in its attempt to define modern colonialism when compared to postcolonialism but does not hit the issue square on its head. 
So why fix something that isn’t broken? Colonialism is the perfect word for describing colonialism today. 
Colonialism is defined as “the policy or practice of acquiring full or partial political control over another country, occupying it with settlers, and exploiting it economically.” Colonialism used to be entirely state-sponsored, such as when the crown of France colonized Haiti, but colonialism now is state-sponsored and corporate-led. Much of the labor exploitation, promotion of white ideologies such as beauty standards and occupation of land is done by corporations. 
Modern companies employ similar methods to 16th century colonizers. For instance, the United Fruit Company’s political and economic control of Central America in the 20th century has shaped issues in countries such as Honduras and Guatemala. 
USC has not been and remains to be immune or separate from colonialism. If colonialism is a body, then racism is its arms and legs, and capitalism is its torso. Colonialism runs on racism to keep capitalism afloat. 
Racism developed alongside colonialism. Its existence is not residue, but instead proof of the continued existence of colonialism. It is not simply physical but also metaphysical and includes the dissemination of ideologies that often present themselves in physical forms like the patriarchy.  
USC has struggled to deal with its racism stemming from both its faculty and itself as an institution. In 2020, they removed the name of former USC President Rufus B. von KleinSmid, supporter of eugenics, from the now named Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Center for International and Public Affairs. However, the school did not change the name of Cromwell Field, named after Dean Cromwell, who was anti-Semitic and racist. 
Changing the names of buildings is only symbolic, though. Other changes can be more effective in furthering the school’s proximity with whiteness. 
More telling of the racism within USC than the names of its buildings, and even more importantly, is its student demographics. The population of Hispanic students at the school totaled 15.6% for the 2021-22 school year. Let’s be diligent in remembering that Hispanic is an ethnicity and not a race, meaning that the school’s whiteness is not exclusive to its sole categorization of “white.” The population of Black students for the same school year totaled 5.8%, an abysmally low number. To no one’s surprise, the largest population in the 2021-22 school year was the white population, totaling 27.3%. 
The demographics for faculty are even less diverse. White people make up 64% of the faculty at USC. While that doesn’t necessarily mean that they will impart a white view of the world onto their students, during my time at USC, professors have not been the most diligent in using the works of academics of color who promote worldviews outside of whiteness in their classes. 
In talking about colonialism, we cannot ignore its role with gentrification. Pushing Black and brown people out of their neighborhoods is only morally possible because of the worldview that colonialism has proliferated. It depends upon the mindset that white people deserve land, that land is for their taking, and the Black and brown people living on it should make way for them. It is manifest destiny repackaged. Colonialism is what has made racism morally acceptable in white spaces and colonialism is what continues to make it thrive. 
Neocolonialism and postcolonialism are words that we should honor because of the academics who dedicated time to deconstructing the unbalanced systems of power that affected all people of color, but Black and brown people more intensely. But from now on, let’s call it what it is. There is no need for new words to describe the modern sociopolitical world. The word colonialism has already done that for us. 
Words matter.
