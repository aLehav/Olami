Senator Navya Singh shared project updates on providing 24-hour dining options for students, including bringing back the all-night Starbucks or making kiosks available at Seeds Marketplace during Tuesday night’s Undergraduate Student Government senate meeting.
“I think the most clean-cut [idea] right now is the Starbucks option,” Singh said. “It is something that we could advocate for because it was a thing before COVID, and the University is really trying to go back to pre-COVID days.”
Singh shared her other projects, such as the creation of the “Sustainability x Speaker” series to be held in the spring, where USG will invite previous alumni or fourth-year students to discuss what sustainability means within their chosen career path. Singh also presented her goal to provide undergraduate students with a Metro pass, so they can travel more easily around Los Angeles. 
“Students don’t really have an opportunity to really explore the city if they don’t have a car, so we’re looking to see if we can get a Metro pass for all undergraduate students to help with that,” Singh said. 
Hunter Hinson, chair of the affordability and basic needs committee, presented the committee’s objectives for the year, which include expanding and streamlining resources available to first-generation and low-income students and building a coalition of stakeholders to advocate for affordability and basic needs issues.
Hinson also discussed the committee’s current projects, including the continuation and expansion of the dining dollars donation program to allow for an extended period for donation, providing textbook aid and club dues assistance, providing medical supplies in vending machines, hosting a clothing drive, reopening the Trojan Food Pantry and providing work-study alternatives for undocumented students.
“What I enjoy most about being chair is that it deals with the issues that I think are the most important for our students,” Hinson said. “Ensuring that students have food and housing is more important than anything else in their lives, as these are the most basic needs, and working with a group of people who are really passionate about the issue and have everyone involved is really good.” 
Vincent Cisneros, a junior majoring in public policy, presented his nomination as a USC liaison for the North Area Neighborhood Development Council. The position had been vacant for a year prior to Cisneros’ nomination and his term will last two years. The council, chartered by the L.A. City Council, meets on the first Thursday of every month to advocate for stakeholders within three designated areas around the city; USC resides in Area 3.
“I’m on the External Affairs Committee … and our main focus this semester is mending the relationship that has been historically turbulent between USC and the surrounding area,” Cisneros said. “Given the fact that position is reserved for [a USC student], it’s a little embarrassing that we’re not filling it because we do have a commitment to this area.”
To join the council, Cisneros submitted a cover letter and was tasked with collecting 50 signatures — the senators all signed in support of Cisneros’s nomination.
The senate unanimously confirmed Alex Rohleder, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, as the student-at-large on the Programming Fee Control Board. The board advises the USG president on whether or not USG should increase, decrease or maintain the programming fee. 
“I’ve got a business finance minor, and I’ve got a little bit of experience working as a manager in an HR company getting to see the financial side of [the company],” Rohleder said. “I just wanted more experience, [and to] have something to add to the resume and a chance to be involved in the student government.”
The senate also confirmed Natalie Battiest, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, and Daniel Williams, a sophomore majoring in political science, as co-executive directors of the Native American Student Assembly.

The Department of Public Safety, USC’s campus police force, boasts a hefty annual budget of nearly 50 million dollars according to their annual security report. This budget, outlined on the DPS website, has caused significant controversy among the USC student body, especially in recent years.
Many students feel that the budget should be completely seized and reallocated to the surrounding community. These sentiments were most prevalent during 2020 and 2021, when a coalition of USC students and staff released a petition demanding a “reimagination of public safety” at USC.
This petition, distributed via Google Form, called for the complete abolition of DPS and urged signees to support USC in severing all ties with law enforcement groups. However, other individuals affiliated with the University still feel that the DPS budget should remain as it currently stands due to the high levels of crime in the area surrounding campus.
While each sentiment holds its respective merits, it’s important to recognize that DPS’s presence in and around USC’s campus is likely going nowhere, even in the face of recent student outcries for its abolition. With this in mind, it’s imperative that we, as students, focus our efforts towards holding DPS accountable and demanding the highest quality service from them.
According to Interim Chief David Carlisle, the Department’s goal is to “provide a safe and secure environment on campus and in the local USC community that allows students, faculty, staff and campus visitors to realize their academic and social pursuits.” However, an overall sense of distrust has been looming over the name “DPS” recently.
In recent years, Black and brown students at USC have expressed that they feel discriminated against and disrespected by DPS. A particularly visible incident in 2019, when DPS fenced off Black and Latinx tailgaters on campus in an allegedly discriminatory fashion, inspired a Change.org petition which garnered over 800 signatures. The petition did not call for abolition; rather, it asked for a resolution to be found.
Additionally, students at USC consistently raise concerns about timing inconsistencies in DPS’s Crime Alert system. Crime alerts often arrive in my student email hours after the initial incident, which puts students, staff and community members in danger.
The bottom line is that students at USC do not currently have full confidence in DPS. As paying-students whose dollars fund the annual DPS budget, we should be able to trust that our campus security is making consistent efforts to create a safe environment for all students.
Although recent attempts have been made, there is still room for improvement. For example, the implementation of “security ambassadors” — also known as “Yellow Jackets” — began in 2009 with the hopes of increasing student safety at night time. These ambassadors can be seen standing on the corners of neighborhoods and prominent blocks near campus. However, according to the DPS website, these individuals are not required to intervene in potentially dangerous situations and are only compelled to report issues when they arise.
Among students, Yellow Jackets have gained a disputed reputation due to incidents of texting, sleeping and unsolicited commentary while on the job. Posts on r/USC describe multiple encounters with security such as Yellow Jackets making flirtatious advancements, uncomfortably following students several dozen feet and harassing students outright. Stories such as these have led to a communal distaste towards the University’s security efforts.
In order to improve students’ trust in campus security efforts, the University should focus on a stricter hiring process that seeks to recruit individuals who are passionate about providing safety and security. In addition to problematic incidents with security ambassadors, DPS has been known to hire police officers who were fired from the Los Angeles Police Department for various infractions, so reforming the hiring process to emphasize experience, diversity and genuine interest in safety could improve both the policing and security ambassador initiatives at USC.
Additionally, USC must confront its history of policing discrimination in order to foster equity and trust among students. No student should feel as though they are targeted by DPS for their race, gender or sexuality. In an effort to curb discriminatory actions, students at USC should have the opportunity to speak directly to individuals at DPS. As of right now, DPS takes feedback online through its website, however, we should work to create an environment where in-person confrontation is facilitated in order to make students feel truly heard. Change is better fostered through real conversation, and students deserve to have their grievances recognized through more than an online portal.
If DPS truly wants to commit to safety and convince the student body that it is deserving of its annual budget, it must make genuine commitments to attentiveness, education and the hiring of qualified individuals through both its security ambassador initiative and officer training process.

Every single moment of our lives is controlled by our decision-making. Choices are compounding — they pile on top of each other, creating a new stream of never-ending options in their wake. The sheer volume of decisions we make every day is nearly incomprehensible — but the American Medical Association estimates that number to be around 35,000.
With each choice to be made, capacity for decision-making wanes. Decision fatigue, a phenomenon described by doctors as an amalgamation of stress and time, which burdens decision-makers, can drive burnout and brain fog. That’s why notable figures like Steve Jobs and Barack Obama have been known to wear the same outfits every day: to save their decision-making energy for more pressing tasks.
But what happens when you can’t make decisions at all? If you’re like me, some of these experiences might seem familiar: never being able to decide what restaurant to go to, searching up menus in advance and the all-too-familiar, “I don’t care, pick whatever you want!” Not to mention the bigger decisions, stretched out over weeks and looming over everything you do, leaving you beyond frustrated and filled with dread over finally having to choose. Indecisiveness doesn’t apply to every decision I make in my life, but when it does, it’s hard to overcome. It’s led me to procrastinate, stress and doubt myself.
I have a deep fear of regret. When there are both myriads of possibilities and a lack of clarity, the future is scary. Too often have I weighed choices, trying to foresee different outcomes, and found myself still feeling lost. It’s all too easy to question my own decision-making, especially when my intuition and logic clash. Indecisiveness is a vicious cycle, with each decision piling on further over-thinking and unease.
To a degree, however, I would say that ambivalence and a bit of indecisiveness aren’t wholly bad traits. Indecision doesn’t mean that you’re bound to make poor decisions, and research agrees.
In a study conducted by researchers at Cardiff University comparing action-oriented (decisive and flexible) individuals to state-oriented (indecisive and emotionally-focused) individuals, groupings that were determined using the Action Control Scale, found that the two groups showed no difference in accuracy nor speed in cognitive experiments. The only difference was accounted for by their differing metacognitive biases — their level of confidence in their decisions. Emotional ambivalence can also increase an individual’s open-mindedness to alternative views.
Being indecisive means you can deeply consider and identify with both sides of an argument, and develop nuanced perspectives. You’re constantly asking questions, looking to gather all the information possible and considering a number of paths forward. You can resonate with the opinions of others easily.
Ambivalence can be a strength, to be sure. I consider alternative perspectives on different issues in the same way I exhaust all possible options when I’m making a decision in my own life. But caring about every outcome and every view is draining; it’s hard to embrace a trait that seems to only be harmful. Decision-making piles on stress, and while it may not be my biggest problem, it both aggregates and aggravates existing stressors. Being perpetually forward-thinking and consequence-oriented is draining.
Here’s a small comfort: You’re never going to be able to predict the future. So for any decision that seems bad in hindsight? There’s no way to have known it was going to happen. Over-thinking is brutal and makes decision-making harder than it already is. Everything in life is so variable and unpredictable — let’s not beat ourselves up over things we can’t control. So here’s my antidote to indecision: Live life without regrets.
Okay, easier said than done. So while I don’t have a magic cure for indecisiveness, I do think that we should stop thinking of it as a flaw. When it comes down to it, I’m ambivalent about being ambivalent. I don’t know whether I think of it as a strength or a burden. And that’s okay too. Not every question needs an answer; not every decision is black and white. Go easy on yourself: You’ll figure it out. If there’s one thing that I’m absolutely sure of, it’s that.

At first glance, “Oddballs” may seem like any other animated television show released on Netflix. However, “Oddballs” (released on Oct. 7th) can be seen as the culmination, the magnum opus, of animator James Rallison’s YouTube videos on his channel “TheOdd1sOut.” 
The comments on the YouTube trailer for “Oddballs” reveal the groundbreaking nature of the Netflix show, especially for those who were first introduced to Rallison’s content on YouTube. Many users expressed that they have been watching “TheOdd1sOut’’ for many years and are proud of how far Rallison has come since then. 
One user named Vailskibum wrote, “It’s still WILD that a YouTuber managed to get a Netflix cartoon, this is great.” Vailskibum’s comment has over 44,000 likes, with one from “TheOdd1sOut” channel itself. 
It’s evident that “TheOdd1sOut” has been able to capitalize on the channel’s substantial YouTube base of over 18.3M subscribers at the time of publication to reach Netflix, arguably the foremost global streaming platform. This is a major event that signifies the power of a digital platform like YouTube, as well as the opportunities available for online animators who create humorous videos independent of traditional animation studios. 
Part of what I think made “TheOdd1sOut” so popular is exactly the theme of the title: being odd. A lot of the content on the channel emphasizes being an introvert, being alone and not really knowing how to interact with others. In other words, much of the channel’s videos are about Rallison’s specific experiences growing up, but they’re also about the broader feelings of being socially awkward and uncool in general.
For myself, I was drawn to the channel due to the “Sooubway” series, as well as the videos “My Thoughts on Roommates” and “My Thoughts on the Science Fair.” Although these videos chronicle Rallison’s own experiences, their sentiments are relatable.
Who hasn’t had horror stories about their past roommates? Who hasn’t been able to secure a reliable partner for a group project? Even though I never worked in customer service, I could empathize with the “Sooubway” video about people asking for recommendations and not taking them or the awkward moment where the receipt doesn’t print at the store. 
With the commercial success of the channel, however, criticisms about the content’s shift in subject matter are inevitable. I haven’t been watching much of the channel anymore, but even I see that the more recent videos are either shorts or about going on tour, being on Netflix and getting his animations turned into a mobile game. Of course, we have to praise the channel and its creator for becoming so successful and still offering stories about life. They’re just not necessarily as relatable as they were before.
A Reddit thread posted by a now-deleted user from two years ago is titled “Does anyone feel like James’[s] content is getting worse?” In the post, the user writes that they “feel like [James’s] personality is showing less, his newer videos just feel corporate-like and it seems like he’s becoming more like a WatchMojo video.”
Other Reddit users express mixed feelings on the issue. User r/TheOddArchivesOut writes that the videos do have an “increased corporate-feeling nature,” reflecting how “the gig is very much a business now instead of a hobby.” User r/I-Am-Sleep comments that the change is evident, as the older videos from 2016 would be “simple” and have less background art, which they claim feels “better.”
User r/Pieman1123 points out the paradox of the situation: “Pretty ironic that (at least from what I remember of his older content) one of his biggest inspirations to pick up drawing as a hobby was Jim Davis and Garfield, and now he’s going down the same route as Jim, becoming less of a passionate artist and more of a corporate entity trying to market merchandise.”
Now, I haven’t been tracking all the changes that have happened since Rallison started making his videos, so I admit I may not have the most comprehensive timeline of information. Societally, though, it seems that the case of “TheOdd1sOut” reveals the sacrifices animators must make to “make it.” While it’s an achievement for a YouTube animator to get his own Netflix show, the path leading up to that kind of success is inevitably marred with claims of becoming a sellout. 
That sort of rhetoric arguably comes with the territory. For a YouTube channel that seemingly branded itself with themes of quirkiness and not fitting in, the main draw of it (at least for me) was the relatability of many of the stories. It might be sad that I can no longer relate to a successful person who is getting a whole Netflix show, but I suppose that’s the price I must pay for my mediocrity.
With a plethora of Reddit users raising the question of fame’s influence on Rallison, the debate over YouTube animation and the world of commercialism has become more prevalent. I love that “TheOdd1sOut’s” content will now be on Netflix, and it’s inspiring for YouTube animators everywhere that just by posting an animated video online, they might be able to attain an international following and have their stories developed into other mediums and on other platforms as well. 
Even then, I can’t help thinking: If your branding was about being uncool, then what does it mean that you’re now successful as defined by this new media age? I don’t know, but I’d think that would make you one of the cool kids who belong: not quite odd at all.

According to Florence + the Machine, the dog days are truly behind us. In her ever-stunning autumnal fashions, Florence Welch took the Hollywood Bowl stage and turned the amphitheater into her pulpit this past Saturday. 
For those not familiar, performing at the Hollywood Bowl is a feat many legends, such as the Beatles and Elton John, have achieved. Seating 17,500 people at its current capacity, the Bowl opened up its gates to the sounds of the opening acts of Wet Leg, known for their biting song “Chaise Longue,” and Hope Tala, a soothing Jamaican British act. 
These openers served a fresh take on the indie-rock genre for the audience. Yet, the crowd varied in age, some being weed-smoking elders and others merely young teens who probably had just begun to form their own thoughts about the world at hand. What a lesson they were in for.
Florence + the Machine’s set was scheduled to play after the openers had ended, but this short intermission coincided with a surprise blackout. The darkness only lasted a few seconds, but the lights came on shortly after to reveal a confused and disappointed crowd. Despite the backup generators kicking in, the blackout was still affecting the whole area. Though people were dazed at first, the volume began to rise as news spread that there would be no Wi-Fi, service or food orders until the power came back on. There were also worries that the Bowl’s strict 11 p.m. curfew would cut the headliners’ performance short. This waiting game lasted a while, though many dads in the crowd began to start organizing a semi-successful wave to pass the time. 
About a half hour past the announced starting time, the lights came on and the crowd cheered as Norm Levin, one of Hollywood Bowl’s video directors, logged into his Microsoft account on the big screen. What could’ve been a panic-filled disappointment became a bonding moment for many in the crowd as they drank too much alcohol and spoke with their neighbors about past experiences at Florence + the Machine concerts. 
As the lights began to dim, it signaled a triumph that would only be the first of the night. The set design consisted of gargantuan crown moldings and an assortment of chandeliers — simple, until the lights came on. The scene was beautiful, even more so as smoke started to pour out from behind the candelabras. 
At last, there she was: Florence Welch, in a glittering Edwardian lawn dress, promenaded out of the shadows. Before even speaking a word, the human embodiment of Art Nouveau was already giving, and our knees were too. Then came her voice. Each audience member was blown away by her half-yodel, half-primal singing. It was enrapturing from the start. 
Asking the audience to put away their phones is a form of defiance that Welch has adopted, and in doing so, she actively works to make the space feel sacred. As she barreled into a declaration of her reign with her song “King,” one thing was clear: This would not be just another stop on a tour, but the creation of Eden. Welch growled into the mic, “I am no mother / I am no bride / I am king.” As powerful as she is, there was a sense of intimacy that could only be from the gathering of women and femme persons. This tour was not made for the male gaze. Yet, there’s an unmistakable difference in this matriarchy: Florence asks the audience to uphold women without falling into misandry. 
“Dance Fever” was an album written in quarantine, at a time when there was yet to be a foreseeable end to isolation. During her performances, Welch expressed her emotions with the fury of a caged phoenix. It’s rare to have a sound reach into your bones and snap you awake, but this was one of Florence’s many abilities to capture the audience. 
God must have heard this fallen angel’s requiem, sending a bout of rain as a rebuke. Welch was not happy about the precipitation, stopping halfway into the show to say, “I’ve been told I can’t perform the way I’d like to, so I’m going to go find out why.” Thankfully, this unplanned intermission came to a close soon after as Welch defiantly ran past the front of the stage onto the platform that went past the pit. There was no stopping her, with all the ecstatic energy of a child who hadn’t ever stepped foot outside before. After finishing the song, she turned to face the audience once again, grinning deviously: “Whoops!”
The audio crew, despite earlier troubles from the blackout, did a stellar job with the mix. The drums rang out like war had begun, and Welch sang with reckless abandon — a mere mortal instrument of a greater power. In her command, the sound became gospel, and there would be no opposition that could stand against her people. There aren’t many things more powerful than a woman or femme person who knows their power, and with Welch’s charisma, it wouldn’t be surprising if the whole tour had been a precursor to a cult uprising that would be able to rival that of Scientology. 
Despite Welch’s seemingly infinite well of energy and breathtaking presence, there was still something so grounded about her performance. She made no attempt to hide her fleeting breaths, nor did she submit to a habitual presentation. During her reprise of “Cosmic Love,” it was as if this was the first time she had uttered the words. The audience was silent at times when she seemed to literally breathe out the words, and it was impossible to tell if the rain on the crowd’s faces were actually tears.
Florence Welch’s concert was a resurrection of dance, and a call for freedom. With her extensive discography and incredible voice, it’s hard not to foresee potential world domination — to a greater extent than she already has achieved. Even for those who haven’t heard her music before, it’s an easy recommendation to go to a Florence + the Machine show. Welch’s artistry is more than just her sound. It’s magic.

It’s been two years since Lil Baby’s last project. On Oct. 14, the rapper released the most anticipated album of his career. “It’s Only Me,” a 23-track album, comes with predictable and expected flows. Despite features from some of the most noticeable names in the genre such as Future, Young Thug and Pooh Shiesty, the album still fails to truly provide that “Lil Baby” sound fans are used to hearing. 
Lil Baby’s 2020 album, titled “My Turn,” set the bar high for fans in terms of quality and playability. “My Turn” had not only GRAMMY-nominated tracks, but also  an extensive track list with songs that are still in heavy rotation today like “Sum 2 Prove” and “We Paid.” “My Turn” set the tone for the impact that Lil Baby could have in the rap genre. 
Even though he’s a staple in current rap, the goal behind “It’s Only Me” was to create enough traction so Lil Baby could etch his name with the likes of greats like Lil Wayne, Drake and Kanye West. “It’s Only Me” was meant to elevate Lil Baby’s status as a great rapper from the 2020s to a true generational talent. But despite being a decent album, “It’s Only Me” will go down as a rare miss for the Atlanta rapper. 
“It’s Only Me” not only suffers from rough transitions, but also from how rushed the project seems. Despite being announced in early September with the arrival of track “Detox,” the content on “It’s Only Me” feels like an essay started and finished the night before it was due. Although “It’s Only Me,” for the most part, is not the Lil Baby fans know and love, there are a few tracks that do have the reliability factor to them. 
Tracks like “California Breeze” show his ability to float on a beat with unique flows. The song reminds the listener of what Lil Baby is truly capable of — the melodic flow he uses throughout the track is what garnered him praise in the first place. However, this flow is specific only to “California Breeze,” and it’s a shame that we don’t hear it throughout the rest of the album. 
One of the best features on the album comes from “Back in Blood” rapper Pooh Shiesty. The pair connect on the track “Shiest Talk,” where Pooh Shiesty blends his heavily influenced Memphis style with Lil Baby’s Atlanta flow. Although sounding lazy throughout the track, Pooh Shiesty makes his lyrics pair perfectly with the piano playing in the background. 
Another ingenious collaboration comes in the form of “Never Hating.” Lil Baby and Young Thug team up to deliver brilliant lyrics over a classic Southern trap beat. Despite creating an almost perfect chorus, Lil Baby gives enough creative space to Young Thug to make “Never Hating” sound more like a collaboration than a feature. Young Thug uses his classic high-pitched sound to imitate the flow created by Lil Baby in the chorus and his prior verses. 
Contrarily, “Pop Out,” is one of the album’s lowlights with a rushed and unfinished feel to it. This attempt by Lil Baby to be spontaneous with the introduction of the feature, Nardo Wick, makes the song sound incomplete. Nardo Wick is introduced by a sloppy and abrupt beat change, making “Pop Out” sound like two completely different songs. Not to say the song itself is terrible, but the transition introducing Nardo Wick is far from pleasing. 
“Forever” is another showcasing of Baby not putting his best foot forward. The track features Fridayy, an artist most known for his chorus on “GOD DID.” From the start of the track, this song feels like a forced attempt at creating a sad but groovy track. “Forever” resembles songs like “WAIT FOR U’’ by Future and “Chicago Freestyle’’ by Drake, but fails to fully capture this sound, leaving the listener underwhelmed by Lil Baby’s lyrics and flow. With fans being aware of Lil Baby’s lyrical ability, “Forever” not only lets fans down but leaves them wondering if this was just a lazy attempt by the rapper to add another song to the tracklist. 
Overall, “It’s Only Me” did not meet anyone’s expectations. Despite the 23-song track list, Lil Baby failed to captivate his audience. Out of the 23 tracks, there’s most likely a solid three songs that will be saved and added to a daily playlist. While it’s important to remember that Lil Baby is an artist and art is subjective, the disappointment surfacing this album does not discredit Lil Baby’s past accomplishments. But, hopefully in the future, Lil Baby is able to release something with a little more creativity added to the concept of the album.

With the inaugural Sex Week at USC now kicked into gear, events are bringing issues regarding sexual and reproductive health to light. In a briefing Tuesday with the Daily Trojan, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman discussed the prominence of sexually transmitted diseases on campus.
“We are seeing a small but steady increase in syphilis cases,” Van Orman said. “That’s consistent with what is being seen nationally and locally. Syphilis, 10 years ago, was exceedingly rare among students; and now we see much higher numbers. We’re also seeing slight increases in the rates of gonorrhea as well.”
In the 2021-2022 fiscal year, Student Health reported 485 diagnoses among 4669 total visits for sexually-transmitted infection screening. Of these, 20 were syphilis and 115 were gonorrhea. For the 2018-2019 fiscal year, these numbers were 16 and 77, respectively. This is consistent with national trends: the CDC reported a steady increase in syphilis cases in the United States since 2001, with a notable increase of 6.8% between 2019 and 2020. Gonorrhea diagnoses also increased 111% from 2009 to 2020.
Van Orman said that syphilis is of greatest concern at Student Health.
“It has significant community and public health consequences,” Van Orman said. “It’s not always straightforward to diagnose and treat. So we are very concerned about that and are really trying to increase screening for syphilis.”
Despite considerable progress in the United States, stigma around getting screened for sexually transmitted infections and diseases persists on many levels — especially for marginalized communities, against whom STIs have often been weaponized. The devastating effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the LGBTQIA community and of the rise of herpes on women — all amid racial disparities in healthcare — continue to reverberate to this day. Van Orman listed several factors that contribute to stigma.
“One is the sense for people that they are not at risk,” Van Orman said. “We tend to perceive risk [with] people that are strange to us, or people we don’t know. So for many people, especially if they’re partners, or students, or people they know, there’s a sense that there’s no risk associated with that.”
Another factor is a general fear when accessing American healthcare, of having their sexual history and, potentially, their sexuality, judged by practitioners or exposed by insurance providers. Van Orman noted that self-screening is available at Student Health for those who do not wish to speak with a practitioner.
“We want to talk to you if you have questions, but we also want people to recognize that we know, for many people, that removes a barrier,” Van Orman said.
Personal and family values, as well as polarized political attitudes surrounding reproductive healthcare, also contribute to stigma around STI screening. Abortion rights have been in the national spotlight ever since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade Jun. 24, and several states enacted, or are pushing for, restrictions on abortion services.
“We have many political leaders in our country weaponizing the receipt of healthcare around reproductive health,” Van Orman said. “It’s very chilling right now for people trying to access needed healthcare services.”
Van Orman also spoke to the success of the ongoing Vaxchella event and said Student Health so far administered 1,500 flu shots and bivalent coronavirus boosters.
“We actually saw more people than we anticipated,” Van Orman said. “Even on Monday and Tuesday, we had to close a little bit early because we had more people arriving than we actually had vaccines available … People seem to have been happy to have a chance to get both at once. So we’re very pleased with the turnout.”
Van Orman said a report with exact data on the number of vaccines administered will be released after Vaxchella concludes on Oct. 21. Student Health will resume weekly pop-up vaccinations at USC Village and the Trojan Farmers Market next week.
Coronavirus and influenza cases remain low, with the former at 18 cases reported on the week beginning Oct. 9 — a skewed statistic due to decreased campus activity over Fall Recess — and the latter continuing to be “sporadic,” Van Orman said. 
At the national level, the CDC reported Friday that respiratory illness comprised 2.6% of total outpatient visits in the last week, which is above the national baseline of 2.5%. The greatest concentrations of influenza-like illness were highest in Georgia, Texas, Tennessee, South Carolina, New York City and the District of Columbia; activity remains low in California.

Every student has preferences when it comes to studying — while some prioritize the secluded silence of a library or the cooling shade under a tree, others would rather collaborate with classmates in a lounge or munch as they memorize in a cafe. 
With 229 acres of land, USC boasts numerous study spots for every type of learner. Midterms offer students the chance to try new study spots over multiple weeks. Josh Grossman, a freshman majoring in popular music performance, said he’s seen more students out and about around campus recently. 
“I definitely have seen more people studying out at the McCarthy Quad, and I think people have been a little bit more stressed about midterms,” Grossman said. 
Adjacent to McCarthy Quad stands another study spot familiar to many students — the Doheny Memorial Library. Built in 1932, this library has five levels of workspaces. However, some students opt to not enter the building at all. 
“[My favorite study spot is] probably the grass outside of the Doheny Library because you get to people-watch and also do your work,” said Jordan Rosen, a freshman majoring in public relations. 
To some students, scenery matters. After being at USC for over a year, Adit Hattikudur, a sophomore majoring in computer science, scouted campus in search of the best view and was satisfied with what he found. 
“My favorite place is in [Fertitta Hall],” Hattikudur said. “Typically, I’ll go up to the third or fourth floor and find these two really big chairs that look out north to downtown, and you get a whole view of downtown [Los Angeles].“
Phoebe Brannan, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said she’s come to find that the atmosphere inside a building matters just as much as the view accompanying it. 
“Fourth floor, [Wallis Annenberg Hall],” Brannan said. “There’s a bunch of nice tables, and the further up you go, the less people there are,” Brannan said. “[You can] just look down at all the other floors, and it’s really nice and aesthetic.”
Many students are still figuring out what learning environment works for them, but some students already know their ideal study situation. Julia Johnston, a freshman majoring in communication, said she feels confident about her study preferences. 
“Personally, I’m a room studyer — in Birnkrant [Residential College], we have our study lounge,” Johnston said. “I just don’t believe in libraries.” 
Johnston said the reasoning behind her disregard for libraries is that the environment inside them isn’t right for her. 
“I think that it’s either too quiet that it’s sinister, or it’s too loud,” Johnston said. “There’s not really an in-between.”
Some days, Grossman doesn’t feel like leaving the comfort of his dorm. Dorm lounges offer him and other residents a collaborative and social environment while also providing quiet and focused study spaces. 
“We have a really nice lounge [in Pardee Tower] that’s air conditioned that I like to study in,” Grossman said. “During the day it’s pretty quiet, but then at night it’s a fun, social hangout spot.”
For other students, including Hattikudur, venturing out of their dorm is necessary in order to facilitate a successful study session.
“I would go [to Fertitta Hall] because it’s farther away from my dorm,” Hattikudur said. “When I’m in my room, I get distracted.”
Once outside of one’s dorm though, morale must be maintained to stay focused. Food plays a substantial role in this for Hattikudur. 
“I love [Ronald Tutor Hall], which a lot of people don’t know about, and there’s a cafe inside of it,” Hattikudur said. “They have banh mi sandwiches and Chinese chicken salads, and they’re really good.”
Although it’s been almost two months since the start of Fall 2022, Grossman said she’s still discovering new places to eat in close proximity to her. 
“Maybe this is just me, but I just discovered a cafe right across from my dorm that I didn’t know about until yesterday,” Grossman said. 
What Grossman found was Literatea, a cafe serving boba tea, coffee and “healthy grab-and-go items” located in the Doheny Memorial Library courtyard. 
Food availability, noise level and view quality aren’t the only deciding factors when it comes to a location to study, though. Hattikudur said that as a student taking multiple back-to-back classes, convenience often determines where he studies. 
“I love Ronald Tutor Hall,” Hattikudur said. “It’s right next to the [USC Viterbi Department of Computer Science], so whenever I’d be studying for a midterm or working on a project, I’d always just go and get something to eat.”
While Hattikudur and his classmates have been exploring new study spots, they’ve also been experimenting with study habits that allow them to blow off some steam. 
“I live in Cowlings [Residential College], and we have a ping pong room,” Hattikudur said. “[My friends] do Pomodoro with ping pong. They’ll study for 30 minutes, play a game of ping pong and then study again.”
The Pomodoro Technique, invented by author Francesco Cirillo, aims to help students with time management. The technique involves working diligently for 25 minutes, taking a quick break, working for another 25 minutes, taking another quick break and so on. 
Although midterm season is undoubtedly a hectic time for him, Hattikudur said he appreciates the time he gets to spend with friends. 
“People are definitely a bit more stressed, but you get to see, spend time and study with people,” Hattikudur said. “That makes [midterms] more fun.”

The Trojans will hit the road this week to take on University of Utah as they continue to fight for their position in the Pac-12 conference.
No. 15 USC comes into the match following their 2-0 defeat of then-ranked No. 25 rival Cal Berkley last Friday.
“Cal is always a tough team to play, and you never really know what you are going to get,” said Head Coach Jane Alukonis. “We were super fortunate to put one away early the first three minutes, so that always gives you lots of energy and good spirits.”
USC’s third minute goal was scored by sophomore forward/defender Kayla Colbert, who also recorded an assist on sophomore forward Simone Jackson’s goal at the 17th minute. Colbert, who was injured for the first half of the season, has been electrifying since her return to the field, totaling 3 goals and 4 assists in only 5 games played. 
“We like her scrappiness. She said that one of her nicknames is Scrap, and I think that is a nice way to describe her attitude when she plays,” Alukonis said. “Kayla’s natural instincts are to get in and score, and she is really light on her feet, so she has been really efficient in terms of getting her fitness back quickly.”
The Trojans were also aided by the return of sophomore midfielder Simi Awujo and junior defender Zoe Burns, who were missing during the Trojans’ loss to University of Arizona as they spent time with the Canadian National team.
“Both of them are really good at keeping the ball,” Alukonis said. “[Zoe and Simi] really help us control the game and play the way we want to, so it’s great to have them back, and hopefully we can just hang on to the ball and dominate because Utah likes to play possession style as well.”
Now at full strength, the Trojans have a plan to continue their offensive attack against the Utes.
“Trying to get them early, attack fast, move the ball quickly and punish them as much as possible [is key],” Alukonis said. “The majority of goals [against Utah] were scored on the counter, so capitalizing on that because we are good in those transition moments.”
But the true key to the game is how the Trojans work together.
“Defensively, just recognizing early what they’re playing and what that means for us in terms of roles and responsibilities,” Alukonis said. “Just figuring out how to work together at a fast pace to try and free open some players for shots.”
With just 7 points in conference play, Utah sits at ninth place in the Pac-12, compared to the Trojans who sit at third with 15 points, behind only UCLA and Stanford. Still, the Trojans recognize that traveling and playing Utah will not be easy. 
“It’s a tough trip because you travel in between, and the altitude and a one-hour time change,” Alukonis said. “Utah, we saw a player was red carded the last game, so we’re trying to do our best guess as to what they’ll play. They’ve tried a couple different formations, and Head Coach Hideki Nakada has them playing nice soccer, so I think it will be a fun match.”
Getting the win in Utah is essential for USC as they enter the final stretch of Pac-12 play. 
“The next 5 games obviously will determine our ability to win the Pac-12, our placement in the tournament, the possibility of hosting in the tournament for some of the rounds and just overall finishing in terms of rank and who we would match up against,” Alukonis said. “The hiccup against Arizona, we can’t have another one of those. We’ve just got to keep driving forward and win out.”
The Trojans will take on the Utes Thursday at 5 p.m.  on the Pac-12 Network.

I’ll preface this by stating that I’ve never shot a gun or killed an animal — unless you include any bug that has ever made the mistake of breaking and entering my room. To the fly I smacked with a rolled up copy of the Daily Trojan last night, rest in peace. 
Growing up in Tennessee, I know plenty of people who enjoy hunting. Many consider shooting and killing a deer for the first time to be a significant event in their lives. I would never enjoy or want to do it, but deer hunting is rather important to the homeostasis of the environment. 
Hunting helps stabilize the deer population, which in turn helps prevent overconsumption of the vegetation deer eat. The decrease in precipitation, which is attributed to (surprise) climate change, is slowing the growth of natural plants. 
The effect is felt worldwide, as seen in the 21 percent increase in the world’s population of people who have experienced acute food insecurity at crisis levels. Additionally, people living in just 10 countries (Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Syria, Sudan, South Sudan, Pakistan and Yemen) make up for just under three-quarters of the reported 139 million people. 
It’ll take so much more than hunting to fix that problem, but every drop counts in the drying out bucket of catching up with the climate crisis. 
A decline in predator populations, caused by the expanding development throughout the country, has contributed to the increase in deer. 
So, while I won’t jump at my next opportunity to kill Bambi, I understand the importance of hunting. It is sad to say, but someone has to do it. And deer jerky isn’t actually that bad.
However, the deer-consuming population is facing a problem. Elevated levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (man-made chemicals that have been used in the production of goods worldwide since the 1940s) have been found in deer killed this hunting season. Used to make anything from nonstick cookware to stain-resistant fabrics, the introduction of PFAS into the natural environment could be harmful to both humans and animals. 
Studies suggest that exposure to some PFAS can lead to decreased fertility or high blood pressure in pregnant women, a variety of developmental effects or delays in children, increased risk of some cancer and a host of other health issues. PFAS are referred to as “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down; instead they stick around in our bodies and increase the chances of any of the aforementioned ailments. That rather extensive list has convinced me to refuse any PFAS on the menu.
It can be tough to filter out PFAS consumption — they’re everywhere, having made their way into fish, soil and bodies of water. Many major cities have had problems keeping PFAS from surrounding factories out of their drinking water. 
Now we can add deer to the list. 
With many states issuing “Do Not Eat” advisories for deer and fish as the knowledge of the increase in PFAS has become more widespread, the hunting industry, and thus the deer overpopulation issue, could suffer. Taking away the ability to eat what you’ve killed could disincentivize some hunters from participating in the sport. 
This problem will likely only get worse. While PFOA and PFOS, two or the more harmful PFAS chemicals, are not produced in the United States anymore, they are still used internationally to manufacture products that are imported into the U.S. 
There isn’t really a correct answer to solving this problem, as seems to be the case with most issues affecting the environment. Limiting and outlawing the use of PFAS seems like an obvious start, but with the financial benefits of using these chemicals, it will be difficult to put effective regulations in place because of a bunch of pieces of paper called money. Additionally, the damage done up to this point is irreversible — these chemicals are around forever. 
So, if you’re a hunter and are looking to mount a deer head above your twin XL bed this semester, be careful what you do with the rest of the body. And don’t shoot your eye out.
