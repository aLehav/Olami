President C.L. Max Nikias announced in an email to all students on Friday that Michael Quick, the current executive vice provost and professor of biological sciences, will take over as interim provost and senior vice president for academic affairs beginning Dec. 1.
Quick, the second-ranking administrator in the Office of the Provost, will serve as interim provost until a new provost is appointed.
“It’s a very nice honor, I appreciate that the president has the faith in me that we are going to continue to do the great work that we do here at USC,” Quick said.
Elizabeth Garrett, the current provost, will step down from her role next year to take on a new role as the president of Cornell University on July 1, 2015. Garrett will be on sabbatical from Dec. 1 to June 30 in order to prepare for her new role at Cornell. Garrett was appointed to the provost position in fall 2010 after having served as interim provost for several months.
She announced she would be leaving USC on Sept. 30.
“Although we will miss her, I am certain she will be an extraordinary president, and that she will build an enduring and consequential legacy in American higher education,” Nikias said in the email announcement.
Garrett brought Quick into an administrative role four years ago when he was appointed as executive vice provost under her leadership.
Quick said he would continue the work Garrett and Nikias have initiated.
“We want to make sure we continue all the things that the president and the current provost, Beth Garrett, have been putting into the place over the last number of years,” he said. “So I look forward to continuing to work on promoting our great faculty and hiring new faculty.”
Among these plans are changes to USC’s general education system, which is undergoing a restructuring to make the classes more applicable to students. Quick said he would continue to work on initiatives that he has worked on as executive vice provost.
“I’ve been overseeing a lot of the revisions to the general education curriculum, so very excited about those,” he said. “I have been working a lot with various deans on new programs, new online programs that we have at the graduate school level, [and] new programs at the undergraduate level.”
He cited the World Bachelor in Business program and the interdisciplinary Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation as examples of such initiatives.
Quick said he would be in the position until a new provost was appointed, but did not know when a permanent provost would be named.
“All I can say is that I know they’re going to look across the globe,” he said of the search for a new provost.

The School of Religion at USC announced that they will be offering a doctoral program for students to receive their Ph.D. in religion beginning in fall 2015.
The five-year program, which begins accepting applications this fall, will allow graduate students to pursue a particular concentration within religion. There are three tracks for students to choose from: Comparative Christianities, Global Islam and Asian Pacific Religions.
The application process for the program includes submitting scores from the Graduate Record Examination, an academic writing sample, a statement of purpose and letters of recommendation. Students will also be expected to be proficient in their track’s respective language. For example, students studying Global Islam should be capable of reading primary sources in Arabic.
Sherman Jackson, a professor of religion and American studies and ethnicity, has been named the new Director of Graduate Studies and was part of the effort to start this Ph.D. program at USC.
“There has been a very keen interest among students to have a graduate program at USC,” Jackson said. “Part of that has to do with the quality of our faculty and what they’ve achieved and what their national and international reputations are, and part of it has to do with the very diverse population we have in Southern California.”
Though students will focus primarily on their respective tracks within the program, they will also have the opportunity to take classes in other departments and programs in the university. This will allow for a broader context of the issues affecting global religion, as well as to be able to put what they learn into practice.
“We have a very interdisciplinary focus as well, and that’s one of the things that really enhances our students’ ability to place their training into conversation within the real-world reality,” Jackson said.
Associate Professor Lori Meeks was appointed the chair of religion in August, a position through which she oversees both the undergraduate and graduate programs in religion at USC.
“Even though this is a graduate program, we believe that it will add a lot of vitality to our undergraduate program, as well,” she said. “We think it will help us create even more enthusiasm around the study of religion at USC.”
Along with the new doctoral program, the School of Religion will be starting a lunch series on Wednesdays where students will have the opportunity to learn about ongoing faculty research.
Like many other doctoral programs throughout the country, the program at USC will be fully funded by the university. Tuition will be covered for students, and they will receive health insurance and a stipend for housing and living expenses.
Several faculty members said they are excited to begin the program next fall. Their focus will be on ensuring a welcoming environment for students to share ideas and beliefs, allowing them to learn not only from faculty, but also from each other. Eventually, students will be prepared to pursue careers in fields such as academia, religious institutions and community activism.
“Here at USC, our focus is on ensuring that students have mastered the textual traditions of the respective religions,” Jackson said. “But at the same time, that they’re able to place all of that erudite knowledge into conversation with the real-life comings and goings of religious communities in the world.”
 
I took two classes in the Religion department both were excellent. I still remember them decades later. The best class I had in college was called “Human Values” taught by Dr. Robb. He and the class were amazing because it made me really look and life differently.
Interestingly, it would take only an atheist to truly excel in such a field.

The School of Pharmacy has received a grant from NASA to explore the potential effects of medicine on astronauts in space. The $600,000 grant was announced last month and is the first such donation from NASA in USC history.

The funds were donated by the national Space Biology Program and will be parceled out over the next three years.
Graduate students Jillian Romsdahl and Junko Yaegashi will use the funds with Dr. Clay Wang, associate professor of chemistry in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences who also holds a joint appointment in the School of Pharmacy. They will work with a team from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena to research microgravity climates and their impact on drug discovery.
“We’ve been interested in drug discovery at USC and, more specifically, the study will look at fungi and how fungi makes drugs both in a lab environment and in outer space,” Wang said. “Examples of drugs that are made by fungi are penicillin and statin.”
This will be the first time fungi will be studied in an outer space research experiment.
The study will involve the team at USC working in collaboration with astronauts on the International Space Station and a research team within the Planetary Protection Group at JPL. Organisms that have been studied at the lab at USC will be sent to the International Space Station by way of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where students will hand deliver them to the launch pad.
According to Wang, USC has been using a genomic approach, which means that the team sequences the entire genomes of the drug-producing fungi.
“Most of the time [fungi] do not make the drug but some of the compounds are anti-fungal, so what happens is the organisms do not make anti-fungi until they encounter another fungi and they basically need to kill their enemy, which results in the drug being created,” Wang said.
Romsdahl expressed her excitement about getting the research underway.
“It gives us the opportunity to begin to answer some very exciting research questions regarding fungal behavior in outer space,” she said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “This project gives us the chance to understand fungal secondary metabolism in a microgravity environment and will likely build a platform for drug development in outer space.”
Traditionally, the School of Pharmacy has received funding from the National Institutes of Health, and on occasion the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense for drug discovery related projects.
“The research will help uncover new basic knowledge that other NASA researchers and engineers can use to solve problems confronting human exploration of space or that could lead to new biological tools or applications on Earth,” NASA said in a press release.
Romsdahl said that Wang was crucial to the funding of the project.
“Professor Clay Wang is an excellent professor and Ph.D. adviser. Without him, this project would not exist,” she said in an email. “I am looking forward to the intriguing research discoveries that lie ahead.”
Wang said that there are also future projects in the pipeline and he hopes to secure more grants in the coming years.

The Office of Student Affairs is introducing an online reporting form for students to anonymously report their experiences with biases on campus.
The form will enable students to anonymously report their experiences with or eyewitness accounts of incidents relating to bias, which is defined on the Student Affairs website as “a preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a group of persons based on their race, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, natural origin, or gender identity.”
The Bias Assessment Response & Support website went live two weeks ago and lists phone numbers for reporting incidents until the online form is uploaded as an option. The form is set to go online within the week.
Lynette Merriman, assistant provost for Student Affairs, oversees Support and Advocacy, the department that handles bias reporting. She explained that a campaign would follow the release of the form to increase student awareness about the resource.
“The form should be up fairly soon, and when we do that, that’s when we can really start on doing a campaign throughout the university,” Merriman said. “We’re also going to emphasize some of the wonderful support resources that we have for our students.”
Merriman said campaign efforts will largely consist of increasing awareness through advertisements on campus, reaching out to cultural groups at USC, distributing educational resources and obtaining student feedback.
“I’m also working with a group of students who have been talking to other students about what’s the best way to communicate this to the university community, like, ’how should I capitalize on social media to communicate this?’” Merriman said. “But I think a good part of it is having conversations with students.”
Merriman listed out some examples of biases that can be reported with this new system.
“Racism is an example of bias. Discrimination is a form of bias; so are things like Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, oppression and so on,” she said, emphasizing that colleges across the nation grapple with these issues and USC is no exception.
USC’s Asian Pacific American Student Services as well as the Asian American Studies Center at UCLA received racist and misogynistic fliers that were sent anonymously in Spring 2014. The fliers contained offensive language and images directed at Asian Americans and, more specifically, Asian-American women.
The official response made last year by the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, a student organization under Program Board, acknowledged the issue, stating that “[t]hough the United States has made institutional strides to promote equality, prejudices against APA [Asian Pacific American] women are alive and well” and that incidents like the flier would not be tolerated because, “[r]acial and culturally derogatory epithets do not have a place in conversations under any circumstance.”
Mary Ho, the director of APASS, declined to comment about the incident. She did confirm, however, that APASS gave the Office of Student Affairs feedback on the implementation of this reporting system and that the organization promises to promote the program.
“The existence of a campus bias protocol will open up conversations about what bias incidents look like and feel like for those who are not knowledgeable,” Ho said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Targeted students and groups can begin to identify bias incidents when they occur and report it accordingly, now that there’s a structure in place.”
Though not sparked by any one specific incident, the bias reporting system was initiated as an effort to provide students easy access to the resources available and an outlet that consolidates all types of bias incidents to be reported.
“In the past, students would typically call DPS, [the Office of] Student Affairs, [the Office of] Religious Life, the cultural center[s] and a faculty or staff member,” Merriman said. “It was important that we make this easier for folks. This was not created because of any series of events. But what we’re realizing is that we wanted to do a better job educating students about reporting and making it an easy process.”
When students file a report, they will be asked whether they were the victim or a friend of the victim, when and where was the incident observed, if they would like to remain anonymous or not, and for as detailed of a description they feel comfortable revealing. There will also be an opportunity on the website to upload photos, for example, of a derogatory picture posted somewhere on campus.
Justice Haque, a sophomore majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, commends the efforts of the university to combat bias but has doubts about the system’s effectiveness.
She said that she thought smaller incidents were unlikely to be reported, but the system could help larger racial issues.
“I think people who have been discriminated against have known this their whole life — it’s not the first time,” she said. “If it were an extreme incident like a hate crime, it would definitely be reported.”
These doubts are valid issues that Merriman thinks should be addressed by advancing the development of educational resources.
“Some students might be saying things that may be perceived as biased and they’re not intentional,” she said. “So sometimes what they said is in fact very biased. We need to help students understand and realize the consequences of their actions since some students have not lived in diverse communities like the one we offer at the university.”

After a tough loss against the No. 10 Oregon Ducks on Friday, the No. 18 Women of Troy came back on Sunday and defeated the Oregon State Beavers in a four-set comeback victory (19-25, 25-18, 25-17, 25-16). This win extended USC’s win streak against the Beavers to 11 matches.
Before the Women of Troy’s game on Sunday, head coach Mick Haley changed the lineup and had senior Emily Young setting in the front row instead of senior Hayley Crone setting from the back row.
Haley insisted that Young brings an extra dimension to the offense.
“She becomes a quick hitter and it puts the other team in a little bit more trouble,” Haley said.
In the first set on Sunday, the Women of Troy came out slow and struggled to find a rhythm. Their offense looked out of sync and their passing struggled mightily.
USC also couldn’t establish its middle hitters, junior Alicia Ogoms and senior Hannah Schraer, making the offense much too predictable. Overall, USC had a hitting percentage of .265 while Oregon State hit .344 during that first set.
The Women of Troy did not have a block in the first set, which allowed to the Beavers to have their way up front. The lone bright spot for the Women of Troy was the play of sophomore defensive specialist-libero Anne Marie Schmidt. Schmidt had four digs and was playing outstanding defense, making plays on several tough balls.
Schmidt talked about the energy she plays with on the court.
“When I get a chance to go in there, I just want to help contribute to the team the best I can,” Schmidt said. “I try to bring energy and help my team out the best I can.”
Losing the first set ended USC’s consecutive set winning streak against Oregon State at 29.
The second set went much more smoothly for the Women of Troy, as they won handily, 25-18. For everything they did wrong in the first set, they corrected in the second. Sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu finally found her sweet spot, hitting .500 with four kills on eight swings. The Women of Troy held the Beavers to a .268 while they themselves hit .421.
The Women of Troy continued their smooth sailing as they took the third set 25-17. Nwanebu continued to have a great match by getting six kills on just seven swings. In the third set, the team hit a whopping .577 and had 10 digs. USC also fixed its earlier problems blocking, putting up three team blocks.
Nwanebu addressed her impressive third set.
“I just played and hit the shots that I knew,” Nwanebu said. “Everyone was very helpful calling the shots before and I just listened to them.”
Up two sets to one, the Women of Troy put the pedal to the metal and did not allow the Beavers to get back into the match. In the fourth and final set, USC continued to take it to Oregon State, winning 25-16. Young had several quick kills when she was setting and found a rising star in sophomore outside hitter Elise Ruddins, who had 10 kills in the match.
The Women of Troy finished with three players with double-digit kills and two players with double-digit assists. Nwanebu led the team in kills with 20 while junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio added 17 kills and five service aces. Sophomore setter Alice Pizzasegola dished out 29 assists, which led the team.
This week, the Women of Troy will head up to Northern California to take on Cal and the top-ranked team in the nation, Stanford.
What tough match vs. Oregon? First and fourth sets were simply bad play with terrible hitting %. This team has no leadership on the court. Supposedly high rated freshman class contributed almost nothing so far.

It was a slugfest on Saturday for No. 1 USC men’s water polo’s matchup at No. 3 Stanford, and the Trojans couldn’t quite pull off a win, dropping a tight 11-10 game in Palo Alto.
Go to war · Senior driver Kostas Genidounias notched three goals in a losing effort on Saturday. The Athens, Greece, native has 57 goals this year. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Though the Trojans are used to playing rematches at this point in the season, USC and Stanford had not met in the 2014 season before Saturday. The teams missed each other in the NorCal Classic, where Stanford played in the championship game and USC played in the third-place game, and the SoCal Tournament, where USC played in the championship and Stanford played in the third-place game.
Stanford and USC exchanged goals in the first. By the end of the first frame, the Cardinal and the Trojans were tied 2-2. In the second frame, however, Stanford would distance themselves from the Trojans. The third-place finishers at the SoCal tournament scored three unanswered goals to gain a 5-2 lead at the half.
The Trojans would fight their way back to a one-goal deficit at 5-6, but the Cardinal would start to distance itself again regaining its three-goal lead at 8-5. Despite that, a goal by senior driver Rex Butler would get USC back within two goals going into the fourth frame. Sophomore driver Nick Bell, who recently earned MPSF Player of the Week honors, and senior driver Kostas Genidounias would bring the Trojans back to even with the Cardinal in the fourth at 8-8.
The rest of the game was spent with the two powerhouse teams trading goals. Bell tied it up at 9-9, and Butler would tie it up at 10-10 after Stanford had retaken the lead again.
Though the Trojans scored in the last minute to beat California by one goal in the SoCal Tournament Championship a week ago, Stanford scored a last-minute goal against the Trojans to take an 11-10 lead with 41 seconds to go. Freshman driver Grant Stein provided USC’s last-ditch effort but his shot hit the crossbar with 10 seconds to go. The Trojans never held a lead in the game by the time the final buzzer sounded.
Having recently been on both sides of a late game-winning goal, USC head coach Jovan Vavic knows these close games are the result of a combination of luck and preparation.
“I always believe that hard working teams always create their own luck,” Vavic said. “To me the luck is created by the teams who want it more, teams that work harder, the team that is better prepared, the team that’s more determined. Luck in life, not just in sports, follows the people who work harder, people that are expecting to do well, people that are not afraid of failure.”
Though the Trojans have a very young team this season, a few members of the squad must have had flashbacks to a similar loss against Stanford last year, when then-No. 2 USC hosted then-No. 4 Stanford. In that game, the Cardinal controlled the game until the Trojans took a lead in overtime. But Stanford stole a 17-16 win with a shocking buzzer beater on the last second of overtime.
Perhaps the freshmen who weren’t here for that loss could have benefited from that experience, as no freshmen scored for USC on Saturday. In fact, only four Trojans scored in total. Three of the scorers were seniors. Butler, led the Trojans in scoring with four goals, Genidounias had three, and senior two-meter Max Hurst-Mendoza added one. Only one non-senior scored, and that was sophomore Bell, who had two goals.
While the Trojans were not exactly on their game, Stanford goalie Drew Holland was. He averaged 8.77 saves per game going into the contest, but racked up 20 saves against the Trojans, twice as many as USC freshman goalkeeper McQuin Baron.
Vavic explained that Stanford’s goalie’s dominance frustrated the Trojans.
“In the first two quarters of the game, we went 2-for-20 shooting,” Vavic said. “That’s 10 percent. We shot the ball very poorly and very unintelligently, and we got the goalie hot. When you get the goalie hot, it’s tough because in water polo when the goalie blocks a couple of shots early in the game he gets confident, and it becomes tougher and tougher.”
This weekend top-ranked USC lost to No. 3 Stanford and No. 2 Cal lost to No. 4 UCLA, which continues a trend of parity among the top few teams in the MPSF.
Next up for the Trojans is a trip to take on LMU on Thursday, Oct. 23, before returning home for just their second home game of the season for a rematch against Pacific on Saturday, Oct. 25 at 1 p.m.

Saturday was a day of firsts all across the college football landscape. The first time redshirt freshman wide receiver Steven Mitchell caught a touchdown pass. The first time a USC quarterback threw seven touchdown passes in a game. The first time Alabama fans complimented the play-calling of Lane Kiffin. Most surprising of all, though: Saturday evening was the first time I found myself rooting for Notre Dame.
Sark it to me · First-year head coach Steve Sarkisian has led the Trojans to a 5-2 record this season. This mark includes two wins over Top 25 teams, in then-No. 13 Stanford and then-No. 10 Arizona. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
I never thought there would come a time where I could actively root for the Fighting Irish. Yet, compared to the unbridled arrogance of Florida State head coach Jimbo Fisher, Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly is practically a saint, and that’s really saying something. Notre Dame quarterback Everett Golson’s fourth-and-18 prayer and subsequent (almost) touchdown to Corey Robinson actually had me out of my chair, cheering for the luck of the Irish to prevail yet again.
While 6-1 Notre Dame is certainly for real this year, what I was really rooting for was the demise of Jimbo, Jameis Winston and Co. Fisher’s time at LSU must have convinced him that they don’t play football west of the Mississippi. That is the only possible reason I can think of for his comments to the media earlier this week. According to ESPN, he was quoted as saying  Florida State and Mississippi State are the only two teams with victories over two opponents currently ranked in the Top 25.
I guess Jimbo in his infinite wisdom forgot about the University of Southern California. At the time of his comments, both Stanford and Arizona were ranked in the Top 25. It was probably just a careless mistake, but Fisher’s attitude is reflective of a seemingly national fetish for the SEC.
Florida State is in a different conference, yet its coach succumbs to the allure of the vaunted SEC, with their hard-nosed, swarming defenses that “play football the way it should be played.” Fisher must be listening to the plethora of pundits out there who stand firm in their belief that football begins and ends in the Southeastern Conference.
Though that may have been true in 2009, it certainly isn’t today. The only reason the SEC has so many ranked teams currently, is because of the conference’s hype in the preseason. Now that the dust has settled, Mississippi State’s wins against LSU and Texas A&M aren’t that impressive. The list could go on and on.
All the while, the Pac-12 is practically ignored because the teams “don’t play defense out west.” Well, I would love to see how Ole Miss and Alabama’s defensive efficiency ratings would fare if you swapped the plodding schemes of Tennessee, Florida and Arkansas with Washington State, California and Oregon State.
You have to look no further than Oregon and Alabama to see selective perception at work. Both teams were upset by ranked opponents, with Ole Miss admittedly being more formidable than Arizona. The Crimson Tide’s sole impressive victory is over a vastly overrated Texas A&M team, while Oregon ran roughshod over an elite Michigan State defense, thoroughly dismantling them in the fourth quarter. Yet, Alabama is two spots ahead of the Ducks.
The problem with the bias is it just isn’t warranted anymore. The Pac-12 isn’t just USC and the nine dwarfs, nor is the Big 12 Oklahoma, Texas and the rest. College football has shifted, few dominating defenses remain and the team that can score at will is generally the victor.
With an array of talented gunslingers and the brightest offensive minds in football running the show, it’s time the Pac-12 and, to a lesser extent, the Big 12, got their due. In any other industry, innovators who are ahead of the trends get praised. In college football, they get mocked.
It may seem trivial to lament the biases in an attempt to change the narrative about the SEC and Pac-12, but doing so can have long-term repercussions. USC is probably not a playoff contender this year, but the Trojans certainly have the resources and talent to be a fixture in the conversation moving forward.
If the committee were choosing between a one-loss USC team and a one-loss SEC team, it would stink if USC was passed over for competing in what is perceived to be a weaker conference. That is certainly a conceivable possibility as it stands now, which is the crux of my issue with the unjustified love affair the media and some coaches have with the SEC.
Speaking of USC, the Trojans had a vintage blowout on Saturday. Though it is hard to put stock in their performance against that Colorado team, the victory showcased some maturity for the Trojans. Last time USC was coming off a road victory over a Top 25 opponent, they were upset by Boston College. To remain focused on the task at hand, and beat up on the Buffaloes was definitely a step in the right direction for this USC team.
It was great to finally see the team open it up a bit. Most of the focus will be on the deep balls, but I was happy the Trojans finally started to utilize the middle of the field, throwing 15- to 20-yard passes between the hashes. Next week will be a better indication of the Trojan’s true offensive prowess, and hopefully it will power them to a victory at Rice-Eccles stadium. A third road win over a top-20 opponent would be very impressive. Even Jimbo might take notice.

USC’s football team welcomed alumni back for Homecoming with an impressive blowout of  Colorado  on Saturday. The No. 22 Trojans (5-2, 4-1 Pac-12) put up 28 points in the first quarter on their way to a 56-28 win.
All day Agholor · Like his quarterback, junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor had a career day Saturday, hauling in three touchdown catches. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler made history by setting a USC single-game record with seven touchdowns on the day. The Bakersfield, California, native did so on a 19-of-26 passing performance with 319 yards. His seventh touchdown, which was also redshirt freshman wide receiver Steven Mitchell’s first career touchdown, broke the record set four times by former USC quarterback Matt Barkley. Kessler also became the first quarterback in Pac-12 history to throw seven touchdowns in the first three quarters of a game.
“At the end of the day, it’s awesome,” Kessler said. “I think the most meaningful thing for me was that I got to watch the guy before me set the record, too. I got to see Matt [Barkley] do it, and he taught me so much while he was here. He was like a big brother to me, so it’s an honor to be able to break his record.”
Kessler got the scoring going on USC’s first drive of the game. He hit junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor on a 16-yard pass that was almost called back when officials thought Kessler threw it past the line of scrimmage. But the touchdown stood as called, and the floodgates opened.
Though Colorado’s secondary couldn’t handle the Trojans’ aerial attack, USC did well in containing Buffs quarterback Sefo Liufau. Liufau finished the day with 143 yards and two touchdowns, and was replaced with backup quarterback Jordan Gehrke at the end of the third quarter.
Sophomore safety Su’a Cravens intercepted Liufau’s first pass attempt of the day to set up another Kessler-to-Agholor connection for a touchdown that put USC up 14-0.
“I didn’t think he was gonna throw it,” Cravens said. “Luckily he did. I should have scored, but I got tripped up.”
USC’s secondary came up big again late in the first quarter, when senior safety Gerald Bowman knocked Liufau’s pass out of a receiver’s hands and right into the hands of junior cornerback Kevon Seymour. That led to another Trojan score, as Kessler hit freshman tight end Bryce Dixon on a 15-yard touchdown.
Kessler kept his freshman connection going with Dixon again  in the second quarter. Kessler also tossed a touchdown to freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith in the first. Smith finished the game with 104 yards on just four receptions, averaging 26 yards per touch. Smith made a highlight-worthy one-handed diving grab early on, which earned him praise from his head coach, Steve Sarkisian.
“JuJu’s been battling a bad thumb,” Sarkisian said. “I think the team appreciates guys that are fighting through stuff, because everybody’s fighting through something. Everybody’s got something nagging them … We’ve got a team that appreciates guys giving it their all to go make those plays.”
Only Agholor had a bigger day than Smith, finishing the game with a career-high three touchdowns, including a 75-yard score early in the third quarter.
Agholor said that he and his teammates had some extra motivation heading into this game.
“This game marked our second half of the season,” Agholor said. “It’s good to see that we took steps forward.”
Redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen took another step forward Saturday night, eclipsing 100 rushing yards for the sixth time in seven games this season. Though most of the attention was focused on Kessler, Allen made himself heard on a 39-yard touchdown scamper late in the third that put USC up 56-21.
Allen’s touchdown exemplified the big play mentality that Sarkisian brought into the game. Leading up to Saturday, he stressed the team’s focus on increasing their big play potential.
“We want more explosive plays on our offense,” Sarkisian said. “We want to throw the ball down the field more and to trust our guys that they’ll go make plays. We did that from the very beginning. They weren’t all completions, they weren’t all caught, but it became an aspect of our team and our game … That’s got to be an aspect that we continue to improve.”
Kessler was happy to soak in the moment but humbly insisted that he couldn’t have set the record without the help of his teammates.
“There’s no individuals on this team,” Kessler said. “Guys are starting to sell out for the team — offense, defense, special teams — and if we can keep continuing to buy into that, continue to work on that, this team can go a long way, in my opinion.”
Quick hits
Kessler’s seven touchdowns tied a Pac-12 record for TDs in a regulation game.
Kessler’s five touchdowns in the first half tied a mark that Barkley and former USC quarterback Mark Sanchez both achieved.
Kessler was named the Walter Camp Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.
USC debuted its new metallic helmets on Saturday. The team will also wear them at Utah next weekend.
USC’s defense held Liufau to a career-low 143 passing yards.
Colorado ran 95 plays, while USC only ran 61.
Colorado wide receiver Nelson Spruce, who entered the game leading the nation with 10.3 receptions per game, caught nine passes for 69 yards and a touchdown.
Former Trojan tailback LenDale White was escorted out of the Coliseum after the game by security and tweeted at Athletic Director Pat Haden to complain about the incident.

With Halloween around the corner there are countless music festivals popping up around Los Angeles. Nevertheless, it is safe to say that there will be none quite like the Festival Supreme rolling into The Shrine this weekend. The brainchild of Tenacious D’s Jack Black and Kyle Gass, the festival will blend live music, comedy and a generous portion of Halloween fun.
Spooky in spirit · Tenacious D is bringing a silly spirit to their Halloween comedy extravaganza. The show will feature stand-up acts, comedy sketches and musical performances. Costumes are highly encouraged, and the haunted carnival should be a festival highlight. – Photo courtesy of Tenacious D
Extending from Tenacious D’s uniquely silly spirit, the festival is kicking into overdrive in its second year. Featuring acts like the Workaholics cast, Drunk History, Bo Burnham and many more, the festival came together after Black and Gass were inspired by a tsunami benefit they played back in 2005.
“We had so much fun doing that concert because we had a bunch of people that were way more talented and incredible than us,” Black said. “And we were like, ‘Wait a second, we should do more concerts [like this], but it should be all of our favorite artists and musicians and comedians in one thing.’” Then last year, as Black describes it, they “decided to just do it” and put on the festival at the Santa Monica Pier. This year, in its new venue at The Shrine Auditorium, the festival has room to stretch its legs and do more things. Black underlined the inclusion of a lot of television show casts in the lineup, a significant change from last year’s festival. The only act returning from last year’s show is Tenacious D itself— the rest of the lineup has been completely revamped. The festival came together in only a few months, as enthusiasm was high for the new venue and concept.
There will be four stages set up — the Phantom Stage, the Gargoyle Stage, the Frankenstein Stage and the Circus of Death — each providing a different kind of show. The Phantom Stage, described by Black as a “gorgeous old Phantom of the Opera-like stage where there’s a giant chandelier and 6,000 velvety red seats,” will serve as a venue for standup. The Gargoyle Stage will be of a smaller scale, but still focused on comedy, featuring acts like Workaholics, Cheech and Chong and the festival’s creators, Tenacious D. The third stage, Frankenstein, will be for larger acts, including the 11-member The State cast, which includes several actors, such as Thomas Lennon, Michael Showalter, Michael Ian Black and Joe Lo Truglio, who went on to find success on other television shows.
But it is the fourth stage, the Circus of Death, that Black seems the most excited about. Set up in the Shrine Exposition Hall, it will be a haunted house-like setup. This area will feature more performance-based comedy acts like Ron Lynch and Rob Zabrecky. There will also be amusement park rides and a carefully constructed creepy ambience.
A new feature of the festival this year is its embracing of the Halloween spirit. With the festival taking place only six days before the holiday, Black joked that they should rename it Festival Supreme-o-ween. Costumes are strongly encouraged, and Black spoke with a special tone of pride when discussing the Circus of Death.
“Our haunted carnival is gonna be better than any other haunted house in all of Los Angeles County. The rest of the haunted houses are for wussies,” he said. “There’s a lot of pretenders to the haunted house throne, but honestly they’re all just wastes of money. Ours is the real deal.” Black also joked that they should just rebrand the whole festival as a Halloween party that also happens to include comedy and music because that would sell more tickets.
The festival’s proximity to the USC campus, as well as a lineup that holds a lot of potential interest for a college-aged crowd, has led to an active effort to increase interest among the USC student body. “Yeah, we’d like the entire campus of USC to go, and we’d like to actually give you college credit and make it a class,” Gass said. “We’re gonna need everyone to come.”
Tenacious D  reached the social media sphere to try and mine this demographic with an Instagram costume contest, awarding free passes to the festival to the fan with the best costume of one of the acts in the Festival Supreme lineup.
The festival has a lighthearted spirit, embracing the inherent silliness of Halloween and showcasing the numerous comedic acts. This surely comes from the Tenacious D tag team at the center of it all. Tenacious D is gearing up for a tour through Asia later on this year, but their performance at the Festival Supreme will be their first since February. With that added importance driving him, Black is the energetic figure at the center of the upcoming event despite his humble attempts to divert attention to the other talented artists who will be performing. The festival is expertly building excitement in the final days leading up to Saturday, boding well for a spooky success.

From gothic garb to live shows that left fans battered and reeling, the UK’s The Horrors carved a name for themselves in the music press before they had even an EP to their name. Unlike many groups that crumble from the pressure caused by hype, however, the band rose above the noise and silenced skeptics in 2009 with the release of their Geoff Barrow-produced second record, Primary Colours. Their maturity and hunger for experimentation and self-growth remained evident throughout their next two records, 2011’s Skying and this year’s Luminous.
Though stateside tours for these albums have been limited, this has not slowed the growing fervor over the band. Several hours before The Horrors’ performance at the Mayan Theatre downtown last Wednesday, fans dressed in Peter Pan collars gathered on the pavement outside the venue, hoping for a glance of one of the musicians taking a smoke break or walking to his tour bus.
This kind of attention is something the band has come to expect in their native Great Britain, but their increasingly large presence across the pond has made them somewhat of cult favorites. One won’t hear their singles on the radio in the United States, save for on independent stations such as Seattle’s KEXP or local favorites KCRW, and it isn’t common to see them in American press. Despite this, the Horrors have headlined high-profile venues such as the El Rey Theatre and The Fillmore, which are usually reserved for well-established artists here in the States.
Their brief tour of the West Coast this fall wasn’t intended to be a short stint; the band had a full North American calendar booked for October and November and cancelled much of it due to unforeseen circumstances.
Fans in California came out on top, however, with all four shows in the state remaining scheduled. The group’s first night in the Golden State brought them to the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, a small venue on the water with nautical décor. The lack of a barricade made the show more intimate and intense, as frenzied fans leaned within inches of the band and one even took to the stage to plant a kiss on singer Faris Badwan’s cheek.
The set didn’t rely on any particular record to carry itself; there was an even mixture of cuts from their three most recent albums. No songs from their debut have been played live since 2010, so it came as no surprise to hear that omission. At one point, a hiccup with Badwan’s microphone cord caused it to become snagged on a fan’s neck and a security guard rushed into the audience. Badwan saw this as an opportunity to leap onto the security guard’s shoulders and proceeded to steer him across the floor, much to the delight of the crowd.
It is this unpredictability and enthusiasm that The Horrors have maintained for nearly eight years that keeps them at the forefront of independent music. Not ones to shy away from vocalizing their opinions, members have been outspoken against laziness in popular music and the ease at which bands conform to stereotypes in order to receive more attention at the expense of their artistry. “Never compromise” is a phrase they have tossed around in their press campaigns, and the mantra sticks. Notable sounds on their past two records include wildly distorted guitars courtesy of Joshua Hayward, a University College London physics student-turned audio wiz.
The president of the band’s label, XL Recordings, also commissioned custom synthesizers to be made for the band that resembled ones featured in one of their animated music videos. The distinct uses of instrumentation created a formidable reputation for the band both in the studio and on stage.
Granted, their live performances have mellowed slightly over the years, as reflected in the calmer states of the band members at their larger show in Santa Ana on Tuesday evening. Their lighting design features grids of circular LEDs and a backline of solid gel spotlights that compensate for the sometimes gloomy nature of their music. Choruses of vintage synthesizers, classic post-punk bass lines and wailing guitars echoed throughout the building. This isn’t to say the band doesn’t have a tender side to them — recent set list addition “Change Your Mind” has Badwan singing about a potential love interest with a lulling melody and subdued vocals.
In witnessing a performance by The Horrors, one can better understand the direction modern bands ought to be headed in. The group’s sound may not appeal to people of all ages and cultures, but their dedication to art over their career has made them a beacon of commitment and ideology in an era when the music industry rapidly rejects bands even slightly less determined.

Flux Pavilion recently said he does not believe dubstep is dying as a genre, and that certainly seemed to be the theme of the Safe In Sound Festival. Five artists lined up at the Hollywood Palladium Saturday to prove that catchy synths and wobbling basslines are still very much in fashion.
Baking up something good · Caked Up played a set including a remix of the Tetris theme that pumped up the crowd before Flux Pavilion’s diverse set ended the festival on a high note. – David Wang | Daily Trojan
One would not peg the Hollywood Palladium as a venue to host a music “festival,” but surprisingly, it gelled extremely well with the size and theme of Safe In Sound. The circular dance floor, surrounded by balconies on all sides, ensured that everyone could have the type of concert experience they preferred. Lines were manageable for the concert, and getting inside took less than 15 minutes, which is almost unheard of for a lineup such as this one.
The lineup could best be described in one word: eclectic. Every single artist brought something new to the floor that distinguished him or her from the rest, yet kept with the dubstep genre in some way. Terravita opened up the night with some pulse pounding basslines and revved up the crowd in preparation for the bigger acts to come. The band’s style is most distinctly reflected in their popular single “Bach Off,” where they combine orchestral sounds akin to those of Bach with nervewracking bass to create a powerful mixture. The trio, hailing from Los Angeles, proves that not everything in dubstep is generic.
Caked Up, the duo comprised of Oscar Wylde and Vegas Banger, went on next, showcasing the kind of music that can only be enjoyed with bass that pops eardrums. Their blend of trap and dubstep featured some surprises, such as a remix of the Tetris theme that nobody expected in what was an applause-worthy set.
It was at first confusing to see a drumset and guitars being set up on stage next, but all was explained once Destroid, the heavy metal trio, came on. Never has the medley of dark chords on the guitar, metal band screaming and wobbling bass sounded so right. Donning matching suits with Tron-esque lights synced to the music, their performance was certainly one to remember.
Then came on the first of the two headlining acts: Adventure Club. Their signature style of dubstep infused with reflective melodies and heartwarming vocals are always a pleasure to hear. They played tracks that have shot them up to fame and also debuted two unreleased singles. With some stage dives and bouncy props, they interacted with the crowd the most out of any act, which is admirable considering the size of the event.
Staying true to tradition, the festival saved the best for last, as a roaring crowd welcomed Flux Pavilion himself to the stage. His thumping beats infused with catchy synths stand as a testament to his superior control over this genre. But rather than stick to dubstep, Flux played tunes from a whole range of genres, including trap, drum and bass, and a great rendition of Queen’s “We Will Rock You.” He sent shivers through the crowd with his signature track, “I Can’t Stop,” and surprised everyone when he pulled out the theme for Star Wars Rebels that he had been working on. This was one night where Flux proved he was as diverse as any artist in the electronic dance music scene.
All in all, Safe In Sound was as its name describes; a comfortable and fun music experience that brought along some great surprises, a sold out Hollywood Palladium and stellar performances from each of the artists.

For a record-breaking six consecutive weeks, female artists have snagged the top five spots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Performers such as Meghan Trainor and Iggy Azalea seem to have collaboratively taken over an arena that had been ruled by the likes of Justin Timberlake and Eminem for many years. The Daily Mail and Billboard have deemed this milestone a new era for “girl power,” but further examination of some of these popular lyrics suggests that the female-empowerment stamp of approval should not come so easily.
Deena Baum | Daily Trojan
Fittingly for this column, the term “girl power” was popularized by a music act. According to National Geographic, the term is commonly associated with the ’90s pop girl group, the Spice Girls. Serving as role models for young girls, the quintet inspired loyalty and sisterhood. Through their construction of a supportive community in “Wannabe,” the Spice Girls highlighted a “sisters before misters” commandment. In “2 Become 1,” the five crooned about making smart choices, educating their listeners to create a safe haven and to openly discuss their relationship issues. Their messages added to the foundation of feminism in promoting individuality and strength.
But it seems that, as of late, many have forgotten the actual meaning behind girl power. It is not a loose assembly of women, known for their accolades with little personal association — this depreciates the unity. It is not about female artists who find it necessary to sexualize their musical words, both in song and music video form.
Take Tove Lo’s “Habits,” for example. In the chorus, the singer belts out, “You’re gone and I gotta stay / High all the time / To keep you off my mind.” Her words illustrate a parasitic dependence on someone else, denoting a divergence from the aforementioned empowered mentality. “Bang Bang” with Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj, on the other hand, is infused with graphic content and irreverence to the female body. Jessie J starts off with, “She got a body like an hourglass, but I can give it to you all the time / She got a booty like a Cadillac, but I can send you into overdrive.” These words diminish women to nothing more than sexual objects. As kick-ass as the title makes it seem, even “Black Widow” by Iggy Azalea ft. Rita Ora paints an unflattering and untrue picture of women. Midway through the song, Azalea sings, “I’m gonna love you until it hurts / Just to get you I’m doing whatever works,” insinuating that all women, when jealous, become obsessive and crazed.
Girl power is not as casual as listing another involvement on a resume or liking a page on Facebook. It is a concept deeply rooted in feminism and equality, so earning the recognition requires effort and unwavering support for the cause — that is, what ingrains unity between women. So while Trainor’s “All About That Bass” might be a celebration of bodies of all different types, the artist, according to the Huffington Post, does not consider herself a feminist. Characterizing Trainor as the poster child for the strength in the female population would be futile because she renounces the fundamental aspects of girl power.
In reality, instead of parading these performers as revolutionary agents in the music scene, we should look at other artists that have been revolutionizing the landscape for quite some time already. Artists like Pink and Lorde openly challenge the norm, inviting others to question politics or social issues in general. Girl power should also include men as well. The Beastie Boys, according to LA Weekly, have been known for their feminist sympathies, captured best in the song “Sure Shot”: “I want to say a little something that’s long overdue / The disrespect to women has got to be through / To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends / I want to offer my love and respect to the end.”
It goes without saying that it would be a bit far-fetched to expect female performers to be Gloria Steinem with back-up singers and a sound stage. But instead of applauding wannabe girl power enthusiasts, we as a society first need to clearly define the elements of feminism to truly progress.

What’re YOU complaining about?  Feminism . . . you don’t think women should get equal pay for equal work, equality in the courts, or have the right to vote ???   (Hope I’m  wrong about you on that . . . but it’s amazing how many don’t know the meaning of the word.)  Yes, if you don’t believe in fairness and equality, I can see where you’d hate it if someone makes a valid point in favor of it. But for those that do . . . well . . . there’s still a lot to discuss as we all (hopefully you included) strive for progress on that front.

It’s easy for millennials to feel special these days considering their overwhelming participation and leadership in current social and political movements. Generation Y is constantly reminded of its distinct advantages over its predecessors, namely the ability to share ideas within seconds, to summon the world of information at its fingertips and to organize groups with the power of a few clicks and keystrokes. With virtual petition sites such as Change.org, visual representations of approval (e.g. the Facebook like) and tools to self-publish, millennials have no excuse not to become involved in at least the discussion of some cause. In other words, with technology that facilitates open discussion and enables transparency, surely this generation will accomplish great social change.
But just because these tools exist doesn’t mean their potential is always reached; their limits are pushed to varying degrees. Unfortunately, most discussions stop short of becoming full-fledged movements. The spectrum of social awareness could start with a tweet or a Facebook post and end with organizing followers into a dissenting student group, like Hong Kong protestor Joshua Wong did at age 15. In fact, the particularly tech-centered youth activism in Hong Kong, Mexico, Brazil and the Middle East has led many to compare millennials to another well-known generation of activism: hippies.
Discussion over this claim is heated. Its proponents believe today’s youth culture — including values, fads and entertainment — carries a striking resemblance to those expressed in the 1960s and ’70s. For example, they compare civil rights to gay rights, Woodstock to Coachella and LSD to MDMA. Millennial activity on social media sites is eerily similar to the freedom of expression practiced by hippies.
But each generation acts according to completely different contexts. Different time periods yield different informational resources, cultural tastes and social, global and political issues stemming from new or snowballing conflicts.
Millennials possess technological privilege, but it is paradoxically also a hindrance to their causes. Hippies had to work harder to inform themselves on causes, not to mention getting their voices heard on a larger platform. Whereas Generation Y carries out its activism exclusively virtually at times, which leads to bandwagoning, hippies genuinely broke down systemic barriers to support their causes. An isolated Tumblr post isn’t directly defying any authority figure. Many traits characterize millenials — an eclectic group above all — but to dub them a generation of activists would be overwhelmingly generous.
Yet, this doesn’t mean millennials won’t have their time in the sun. To deny activism as a relevant aspect of Generation Y would be equally off-putting. Today’s youth is idealistic with an entrepreneurial drive that can be at times naïve. A recent poll, conducted by telecom giant Telefónica, asked millennials worldwide a series of questions regarding their influence on their surroundings. A majority of young people from the 27 countries polled believed they could make a local difference. The poll also revealed that most millennials see hope for growth in entrepreneurship. And it’s hard not to feel special when a month ago, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon  called on today’s youth to take action in spreading democracy. According to Ki-moon, young people currently possess unprecedented networking skills, as well as the largest demographic stake in the global population.
Though this is all good news, social media tools like “likes” and “favorites” could give millennials a false sense of their influence. Their activism shouldn’t stop there. The lazier end of Generation Y should learn from inspiring contemporaries such as Joshua Wong and navigate the continuum of social change in a digital era rather than try to find themselves in yellowed photos of Woodstock. It might create unnecessary pressure to be constantly reminded of generation-specific advantages, but the truth is not all millennials are created equal. Though there are some tremendous social movements underfoot through innovative use of modern tools, there are also highly embarrassing abuses of them. Generation Y is neither special because of its resemblance to previous generations, nor for its unprecedented gadgets and networks.
The future will remember millennials not for the posts that had the most Facebook likes, but for the innovators who used their resources to make meaningful social change.

Frequent visitors of a popular film review site will know that some films are rated rotten tomatoes, and some films are rated fresh tomatoes. There’s a third type, however, that includes most other movies and often goes unwritten about: the tomato that has been left in the fridge a little too long and lost a bit of flavor.
From Matthew Saville comes just that sort of film: the thriller Felony, a gritty psychological investigation into honesty and loyalty that, instead of inciting an intense emotional response to an unquestionably dark story prefers to instill in viewers a collective urge to shrug their shoulders and sigh, “meh.”
In Australia, after celebrating a successful drug bust, police officer Malcolm Toohey (Joel Edgerton) drives drunk and hits a paperboy who is delivering the morning news from his bicycle. When veteran detective Carl Summer (Tom Wilkinson) arrives on the scene, it doesn’t take him long to figure things out and construct an alibi to save Toohey’s career. He arranges a cover up that, among other things, pins the accident on a fictional hit and run driver.
Things begin to unravel when his rookie partner Jim (Jai Courtney) begins to notice inconsistencies in Toohey’s story and the ensuing investigation. As tensions mount, the three men begin to question each other’s values of justice, guilt, innocence and ultimately, each other.
The film was screened as a special presentation at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival and now gets a bigger bite at the apple with an international release this month. Unfortunately, Felony has bitten off more of the apple than it can chew, and feels a bit haphazard in its approach to an otherwise sharp premise.
For example, Felony is rather schizophrenic in its takeaway: as the story unfolds, it is unclear just what Felony wants us to think, and just when we’re sure we’ve zeroed in on the big reveal, the clutch thuds and the gears shift. In a suspenseful thriller such as this, the one thing we aren’t supposed to be guessing is the movie’s message, and yet the distracted nature of the flick quickly switches from a criticism of police loyalty to truth telling, and yes, even to the inappropriateness of a cop making sexual advances towards a mother whose boy lies dying a boy in a coma (for shame!)
Correspondingly, Felony also feels a bit scatterbrained in its story line: while its use of several subplots to build a more convincing background for the main drag is an admirable attempt, what it really ends up doing is tying a Gregorian knot of sorts full of loose ends and lacking backstories.
Case in point is Malcolm, who viewers will surely be disappointed in given his immense potential to carry the movie’s emotional load. Hilariously, we are never really sure who Malcolm is, what he wants in life, what drives him, and what’s going on in his brain. Put simply, Joel Edgerton fails to sell Malcolm’s pain to the audience, and ends up instead portraying himself as a big whiner. While Summer and Courtney produce characters with very compelling and clear personalities, Toohey produces characters in Malcolm that we desperately want to feel bad for, but for some reason just can’t This is emblematic of a broader anchor that keeps the film’s ship docked safely in mediocre harbor. Across the board, the film is held back by the lack of a convincing backstory for any of the characters: they are clearly defined in the moment, but their motivations and personal experiences are totally unexplored.  Edgerton’s performance is a notable exception: the veteran actor creates a gritty picture of a battle hardened detective willing to do anything at any cost, and it’s effective.
Here’s the sparknotes version: watching Felony is like watching the producers try several times to pin the tail on the donkey, but only after being spun around a few extra times and told the donkey is several feet to the left of its actual location.
One question the film creatively asks listeners to sort out is, who’s the protagonist? If nothing else, the film correctly and bluntly brings human nature back to earth by smartly reminding audiences that even the goody-two-shoes of this world are not without serious problems. In this way, the movie deserves praise for not falling into the trap of some films to create a hero who can seemingly do no wrong. There is no such character in Felony, and the film’s honesty is oddly refreshing.
Nevertheless, Felony is like gourmet prison food served to real-life felons: it’s certainly full of surprises, but doesn’t have anything special. A little more emphasis on character depth and slightly more humanized characters would have done it well—but as it stands, potential viewers would do better to spend their time in the rec yard elsewhere.
