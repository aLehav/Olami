A team of six USC Keck School of Medicine students received first place in the annual California Academy of Physician Assistants/ Kaiser Student Medical Challenge Bowl, a competition in which students are quizzed on their medical knowledge. The bowl took place in Palm Springs, Calif., on Oct. 9.
Street smarts · Keck students Carrie Kowalski, Ernesto Ruvalcaba and Brittany Coffin accept a $250 award for first place in the competition. - Photo courtesy of Christopher Forest 
Captain Carrie Kowalski, Brittany Coffin, Ernesto Ruvalcaba, Joelle Gizzi, Melinda Oliver and Lauren Ross competed in the bowl. All six participants are second-year students in the Primary Care Physician Assistant Program, which is a three-year master’s program at Keck.
“It is a long-time tradition of USC to participate in this competition. USC won the CAPA bowl trophy last year, so the students wanted to maintain that tradition,” said faculty coach Christopher Forest, an assistant professor at Keck.
Before 2009, the last time USC won the bowl was in 1999.
Five schools participated, including Western University of Health Sciences and San Joaquin Valley College.
The competition was formatted like the show Jeopardy!, and culminated in a final round, Forest said.
The students won a trophy and a $250 prize, which was provided by Kaiser Permanente.
Team members spent several months studying for the competition.
“We prepared individually over the summer and got together every week once school started,” Ruvalcaba said.
Any topic in the realm of medicine was fair game for the bowl. In preparing for the competition, the students said they reviewed a considerable amount of material.
“It was tough as second-years because we haven’t had all the material, so as we were studying we actually had to study stuff that we hadn’t gone over in class,” Coffin said.
The first-place trophy is on display in the student lounge at the USC Physician Assistant Program center in  Alhambra. The trophy will be kept there until next year, when it will be presented to winners of the 2011 Student Challenge Bowl.
“The students take a lot of pride displaying that trophy in the student lounge area,” Forest said. “It’s something the students aspire to keep.”
Coffin said the competition victory is a good way to generate interest in becoming a physician assistant.
“I hope that this encourages more people to look into the profession and know that we are well-rounded practitioners and we have a lot of knowledge at our fingertips. It’s good to get the physician assistant career out there in front of people,” Coffin said.

Earlier this week, it was reported that the university had established a new set of regulations for on-campus tailgating, effective immediately (though DPS plans to ease in the regulations throughout the semester).
Although many of the rules simply restated existing policies, the most attention-grabbing of the provisions were restrictions on loud music and and the already much-disdained ban on drinking games, such as beer pong.
The reasoning for this ban stems from an effort to keep the tailgating experience a family friendly environment.
Drinking games were targeted as they encourage the mass consumption of alcohol in a short amount of time, leading to quicker intoxication and a higher probability of injury or disorderly conduct.
Those found in violation of the rules could be cited and referred to Student Judicial Affairs, with non-student visitors potentially asked to leave campus property.
Many have questioned the regulations; all things considered, we want to know:
Do you think that the current state of tailgating on campus is a problem?

After two months in office, university President C.L. Max Nikias’ leadership and communication with students has received positive reviews from student leaders and administrative officials.
Hands on · President C.L. Max Nikias has met with the Undergraduate Student Government to discuss students’ goals and concerns for the year. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Nikias took office on Aug. 3, but will be inaugurated today as the university’s 11th president.
“He really cares about the experience students have at this university,” said Nehi Ogbevoen, vice president of the Undergraduate Student Government. “He understands that we are truly here for more than a degree, but this is also where we eat, sleep, network and learn outside of the classroom.”
Ogbevoen said Nikias has taken the time to sit down with USG and discuss student concerns.
Nikias has also been receptive to graduate students, said Graduate and Professional Student Senate President Jenny Novak.
“After his appointment to office he called a meeting to meet with the GPSS Exec Board regarding our agenda for the upcoming year and our greatest concerns as graduate students,” Novak said. “I have been impressed by his accessibility and his enthusiasm for his new position.”
Novak said the president has supported GPSS’ goal of providing housing for first-year graduate students, along with other projects.
“We would like to work with him to expand summer funding opportunities for Ph.D. students, as well as give graduate students more teaching opportunities on campus to make us more competitive on the job market,” she said.
Administrators said they have also felt that Nikias is an effective leader who is willing to connect with all members of the university.
“On a personal level, his energy and enthusiasm for USC are really incredible,” said Jean Morrison, executive vice provost for academic affairs. “He understands the DNA of the university and because of that is able to lead the university to really great new places.”
The president sponsored a welcome event for Ph.D. students and scholars that was an important occasion to speak to students, Morrison said.
“He really gets the fundamental character of USC,” Morrison said. “We are incredibly fortunate to have Max Nikias as our new president.”
At the beginning of his presidency, Nikias said one of his goals was to regularly connect with students by hosting afternoon teas, of which student leaders said they have enjoyed.
“He has been more than willing to take time of his extremely busy day to sit down with us and listen to issues that we find important,” Ogbevoen said. “I love the intimate teas that he has with students, really makes us feel special. It is amazing how receptive he is with our ideas.”
Jonathan Munoz-Proulx, a senior majoring in theatre, said Nikias has been influential in many aspects of the university, from engineering to arts.
“I’m a huge fan of President Sample,” Munoz-Proulx. “I didn’t think it could ever get better, but Max Nikias is doing an incredible job.”

At least six gay teenagers have taken their own lives in the past month, many as a result of harassment or prejudice from their peers. In response, leaders of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community at USC have taken the opportunity to stress the steps that must be taken to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.
In the most publicized case, 18-year-old Tyler Clementi of Rutgers University killed himself after his roommate posted a video on the Internet of him with another man in his bedroom. Zach Harrington, 19, Raymond Chase, also 19, and three other gay teenagers have also committed suicide last month.
This string of suicides has shaken communities across the nation — including here at USC — where groups have been hosting events in honor of GLBT History month.
Vincent Vigil, director of USC’s LGBT Resource Center, said that the recent suicides were the latest in a long history of prejudice aimed toward the LGBT community.
“Obviously a lot of our students were shocked by the suicides, but I think that within our community there’s kind of a numbness to harassment or bullying or homophobia,” Vigil said. “A lot of students have dealt with that before, so for us — and it’s kind of sad to say this — but a lot of us become numb to those.”
Vigil also said such harassment is still harmful to many LGBT students, especially those who are not yet completely comfortable with their sexuality and don’t have access to the types of resources that can help them cope with harassment.
“It’s devastating because you’re already dealing with a student who feels different than everybody else,” Vigil said. “They feel marginalized, like they’re not a part of the entire community. They feel like a minority. So when you add that on top of the bullying or harassment, it just intensifies their sense of feeling different or being alone.”
LGBT students often struggle with their identity in an environment where they are exposed to prejudice and harassment, whether or not the harassment is intentionally harmful, said Matthew Hanson, a freshman majoring in public relations who identified himself as gay.
“To have other people just attacking them for something that they’re not even sure they’re comfortable with themselves, that’s what really just kills it,” he said.
Hanson voiced his distress over the news of the suicides as well as his surprise at the amount of media coverage given to the suicides.
“This was something that everyone on the Internet was talking about and people were making Facebook groups about it,” Hanson said. “That’s shocking that a tragedy like this would get that much attention in today’s society because you don’t really get a lot of news from the gay community.”
Emily Allen, executive director of Queer & Ally Student Assembly, said even the smallest actions of tolerance will help in the long run.
“People who are supportive really need to speak up and let their friends know who might be dealing with problems of harassment and discrimination, or even just problems of not feeling comfortable with themselves,” said Allen, a junior majoring in English and psychology.
“Even strangers, if they just show support in small ways towards the LGBT community, people might feel more apt to speak up when they’re having trouble,” she said.
Allen said even with the recent suicides, the overall attitude toward the LGBT community seems to be improving.
“So many different communities around the country are pulling together, trying to prevent instances like this from occurring in the future,” she said. “It’s a shame that tragedies like this have to occur to get people to take widespread action like they’re doing right now, but at least it is moving in a positive direction, and in large numbers.”
The rash of suicides comes at an important time for members of the LGBT community at USC, as they celebrate a month of events aimed toward increasing tolerance across campus.
Monday marks the start of Ally Week, during which supporters of the LGBT community are encouraged to “come out” as an ally. Organizers hope that such events will continue to foster a welcoming environment on campus even in the midst of such tragedies, and students seem to be reacting well.
“More than a lot of other schools, we are still very accepting,” Hanson said. “There’s a lot of comfort with the whole Ally Week thing and the fact that the administration took notice and wanted to put that out there that USC is legally, socially and at all levels a truly gay-friendly school.”
Joshua Morris, assistant executive director of QuASA, participated in an LGBT Resource Center discussion last week in which students expressed their distress over the suicides.
“Everyone was shocked that it got to this point where so many students would kill themselves because of their peers,” said Morris, a senior majoring in psychology. “The saddest part for me was that it lets us know that the self-esteem of the members of the LGBT community is not high enough, and we need to help each other, reach out and really support our other schools.”
The university has several resources for students who feel uncomfortable or threatened because of their sexual orientation, including the LGBT Student Resource Center, QuASA, the Trojans Care for Trojans website, and peer mentoring and counseling programs. The responsibility, however, ultimately lies within students to take action to create a more accepting environment.
“Do something for these students who were affected by the suicides,” Vigil said. “Do something simple, do something grand, do something mediocre — just do something to show your support or your enthusiasm towards the LGBT community. A little can go a long way.”
I too am deeply saddened by these deaths. As the Director of USC Student Counseling Service, we have seen the suffering due to bullying and disrespect. Being in pain, along with potential feelings of not belonging and perhaps the thought that you are burden to others, the will to live can be lost. Some experts believe that suicide is “contagious”. This makes it all the more important that we Trojans stand all together. We must embrace and show respect to everyone in our community. Ally week is a great opportunity to do so. And please remember that if you are in pain, or know someone who is, you are not alone. Counseling works and USC Student Counseling Services are here for you, free and confidential.

University officials have confirmed that President Barack Obama will speak at USC, after rumors of his visit circulated around campus this week.
Commander in chief · President Barack Obama will speak on campus next week while he is in Los Angeles to campaign and fundraise for California Sen. Barbara Boxer. - Daily Trojan file photo 
The president will give a speech open to the general public at 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 22 at McCarthy Quad, said James Grant, assistant vice president of media relations.
Jason Duong, director of the USC Political Student Assembly — the group hosting the event — said he was contacted by university officials after Obama’s staff asked to come to USC.
“I was in disbelief when I got the call,” Duong said.
Though specifics of the event are still being worked out, Duong said, such as whether or not classes will be cancelled, PSA will be reaching out to several campus groups to help with organization.
His major focus now is to get as many students as possible to attend, regardless of their political inclinations.
“Whether they like him or not, this is definitely something that’s great for the university,” Duong said. “I’d encourage all students to come see what he has to say.”
Obama has spent significant time on the campaign trail recently, lobbying on behalf of incumbent Democrats who have found their re-election bids too close for party comfort.
One of those politicians includes California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who will also make an appearance on campus on Oct. 22.
The Democratic National Committee has rented space within the Ronald Tutor Campus Center to host a fundraiser for Boxer, a third-term incumbent who is locked in a tight race with former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. Obama is expected to campaign with Boxer while in Los Angeles.
Grant stressed the Boxer fundraiser was separate from the president’s rally and said that USC rented space out to the DNC as it would any other outside organization looking to use university facilities. The DNC is paying for the space, he said.
The Boxer campaign could not be reached for comment, but Patrick Bailey, associate dean and executive director of student life and involvement, said the campus center Grand Ballroom had been booked for the lunch-time event.
Though the president attended a fundraiser in Exposition Park last spring, next week marks the second time Obama has come to USC’s campus. The president spoke to students in October 2006 as a U.S. senator.
Obama will join the ranks of several prominent politicians who have come to USC either as president or a presidential hopeful, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The most recent sitting president to speak on campus was Ronald Reagan in 1984.
Students said they are excited to have the opportunity to hear the president speak and hope he can motivate students to vote by talking about issues that matter to them.
“He’s faced  a lot of voter apathy in our generation, and it’s very important for people to vote — whether they are Democrats or Republicans — and be involved politically,” said Mason Flink, a graduate student studying motion picture production. “If he can inspire students to get involved by coming to campus, it’s a good thing.”
Nelson Brooks, a junior majoring in business administration, said although he probably won’t attend the speech and doesn’t share the same political beliefs as Obama, he still thought the visit was important for the university.
“It’s definitely a privilege for our school to host him,” Brooks said. “Regardless of political party, he’s the president of the most powerful country in the world, and that is a huge honor for our school.”
Duong agreed.
“Having such a crucial figure not only for California but for the nation really is a testament to what we’ve been doing as a university and how our students are engaging the public,” he said. “I mean, if the president of the United States wants to come to our university, that’s a huge deal.”
Rachel Bracker contributed to this report.
It takes time to grow up and learn to share.
is the public allowed to attend this event as well??
You have just put the Hex on this weeks football game.
SHAME ON YOU for having this loser speak at USC
I am a USC Alum and spent the last two years making a documentary film about Obama and his criminal pals in the DNC.  These people are corrupt, criminals who belong in Federal Prison, and Obama should be impeached.  Period.  I am stunned that anyone at USC would be ignorant enough to support this fraud who has destroyed our country.  Shame on you if you attend this BS rally, and support this Anti-American twit.  I thought we were all smarter than that.  If you don’t understand what is being done to this country by Obama and his loons, then you better educate yourselves before there is nothing left for your children.  The American Dream is just about dead, thanks to 4 years of Nancy Pelosi and 2 years of Obama.  I can’t imagine my fellow Trojans being too dumb to “get it.”  Show this loser the door and go do something constructive with your time.
I hope you guys can see through his BS and show him the door. This wonderful country is doomed if we have to put up with another term of this poor excuse for a president.
The middle class will be totally destroyed by his policies.
Oh Barry if you only knew how CRYSTAL CLEAR the American people’s thinking is your mind would be completely blown away! The students at USC are on to your liberal, out of control spending and usless ways!! The people will be using their God given power, talent and freedom to vote out your corrupt thugs in office this November 2nd!! Quit wasting our tax dollars sporting around the country in Air Force One campaigning at our universities for your own self gain and washed up Dems!! Our youth is on to you!!  They know that we need JOBS in America and our economy stimulated not morons re-elected into office to control us and push socialism on the American people!!  They do listen to their parents!! Go back to the White House sit down have ANOTHER BEER & ANOTHER ROUND OF GOLF on us! Afterall, it’s what you do best!!  Rest up Barry, relax and enjoy the rest of your term in office as the American people are READY, WILLING AND ABLE to vote you out of office in 2012!
Government jobs for all! Tax the wealthy! More spending and government bailouts! Oh and let’s make our countries healthcare (which is number 1 in the world) like the DMV. Obama has wrecked his party but that’s probably Bushs fault, too.
Who is running the White House?  Obama is such a egomaniac he has to pump himself in crowds he carefully arranges to fan his own ego.  He is a menace.
Vote republican if you want things in our country to improve
Vote Republican and you deserve what you will get this time.  Didn’t the conservative, no-regulation, let business rip everyone off, wreck the economy enough for you last time?   I support Obama!
@Micki…It was the Dems…. Everyone should own a home (whether they can pay for it or not) campaign through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (unregulated) that has helped BK our country and has caused this housing collapse!!  Don’t be a sheep and get your facts before condemning the Republicans.  It’s not about Dems vs Repubicans right now it’s about survival and voting in those Americans which will protect and preserve the values on which America was founded!  Do you really want to be regulated and controlled forever???  Wake up and take a stand! Value yourself and your own personal efforts for your own well being and for your future generations! I’ll leave you with the following awesome quote from Dr. Adrian Rogers.
 “The late Dr. Adrian Rogers (1931 to 2005) Memphis , TN , offered the following observation several years ago and it bears great Significance today:
“You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the rich out of freedom. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving. The government cannot give to anybody anything the government does not first take from somebody else. 
When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend is about the end of any nation.”
Like I said above, if you are still listening to the bought and paid for media lies about who destroyed the economy, then you need a better education than clearly USC is providing you.  The global economy collapsed because of Fannie and Freddie – the Democrat SCAM that has cost us 6 Trillion Dollars, and sent a shockwave around the world, causing other countries to suffer through a collapse.  
You can blame Carter and Clinton for the CRA (look it up) and the housing bubble, then Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Frank Raines, etc. ALL DEMONCRAPS for Fannie and Freddie and the notion that giving away free houses, causing banks to collapse because no one paid their mortgages, etc. is something only a Demoncrap would think is smart.  
Bush, McCain and the GOP have REPEATEDLY tried to stop the Demoncrap scam, and they were prevented from doing so.  Even as recently as the Fraud’s so called “financial bill” in which the Demoncraps REFUSED to add the GOP amendments to regulate Fannie and Freddie.  Bush went to CONgress 17 times in ONE YEAR to tell the Commuloons that the economy would collapse if they didn’t stop the Fannie and Freddie mess.  If you have a brain, you can go to youtube and find the videos if you search “Democrats and Fannie and Freddie.”  Also, it’s Congressional Record that Bush, McCain and the GOP tried to stop it.  Before you lie that “Bush did it” and make a fool of yourself, get some facts.
If you are American, you vote GOP in two weeks.  The rest of you grow up, do some reading and educate yourselves, and for God’s sake stop thinking it’s cool and groovy to be a so called “Progressive” (Communist).  It didn’t work in Soviet Russia, and it’s not working in America.  Is this REALLY the life you want for your kids?  The highest poverty level in history, highest unemployment, all the jobs and businesses leaving the country.  LOOK AT CALIFORNIA.  Failed liberal policies and we are BANKRUPT.  You get what you deserve.  Wake up and vote like adults.
Oh, yeah, and the big news today is that after we taxpayers have ALREADY bailed out Fannie and Freddie to the tune of BILLIONS the estimate is that Obama and his criminals will be raping us of $363 Billion MORE in the years to come.  Like I said, they belong in PRISON.
I urge all USC students to attend the Hussein rally, and make sure to wear a good pair of shoes.  I will be attending to report for the Alibaba News.

He won’t be taking any questions that are not on the teleprompter
Hi Freddy,
If he is in fact only taking questions from a teleprompter and you are involved in this area, how can I send in my question? I’m an Arts reporter at USC Annenberg.
Best,

Wonderful news about the Presiden’ts upcoming visit on Friday to the USC campus. Have an open mind;listen and ask questions. This is a rare opportunity for students to engage in the political process with the POTUS.  For those of you that do not agree with his positions on the key issues, please refrain here from espousing more of the ridiculous, inflammatory  comments  that are coming hourly from the airwaves in the form of blatant  fearmongers such as Limbaugh, Rove, Gingrich and Palin. History has shown that fearmongering, prejudice,ignorance and hate will not succeed.
USC Alum is another left wing extremist who believes the First Amendment only applies if you agree with him.  Typical Nationalist Socialist hate speech disguised as tolerance.  USC Alum…did you hate war until it became Obama’s war in Afghanistan?  Did you hate the Patriot Act until Obama used it suppress free speech? Were you for the legailization of marijuana till Obama’s AG decided to prosecute you anyway?  Were you for the closing of Gitmo until Obama ran into reality?  Were you for Gay Marriage till Obama invited Rick Warren to the inauguration.  Hypocrite.
National Socialists hate speech. Nonsense!  Remember the Nazis were conservative, pro-big business, pro-family, nationalist, pro-military build up, JUST LIKE THE REPUBLICANS AND TEA BAGGERS.
Actually, little Micki,  the Nazi party was the National Worker Platform which was the Socialist Party. They ran against the conservative party dear, not as the conservative party.  They ran on the Healthcare platform little one. Learn history prior to quoting. I expect more even if you are only educated in the US.

Great message there, USC ALUM: “Come with an open mind, engage, ask questions, and listen… and if you disagree with my side, you’re a blatant fearmonger inflammatory idiot who takes orders from the monstrous demons I imagine the following people (who I never listen to) to be.”
I am so proud to be part of the Trojan Family….Welocme to USC Mr. President!!!!!
Let me personally invite President Obama to our daily 4:20 celebration in New North.  Come and smoke the peace pipe with us!
Now there’s a toke I can believe in.
Great News!  Presidend Obama has faced many challenges during his administration and has demonstrated that he can lead the country through them.  
The middle class is hurting and we have a president that can fight for us.  Our incomes have not seen a rise since 1999.  Health care and financial reforms are essential.
Lets work for a strong middle class!
How sad that a USC GRADUATE, someone who claims to have a degree from USC would believe, in any way, that the current US administration is “socialist”. The current US administration has made a number of mistakes, and their policies are often illogical, but socialist? I think USC needs to look at what we teach in our classrooms if graduates do not know or understand the fundamentals of government, and so hop on what ever populist “express” train is riding through town. Just because someone on TV calls Obama a Nazi or socialist or Muslim does not make it true.
First the sanctions and now this.  It’s been a tough year at USC.  Fight on, Trojans.  It can only go up from here. Beat the Bears! Beat the Sanctions! Beat the Socialism!
lol wut.
Seriously?  Socialism?  Did you go to social studies in high school?  Do you know what socialism is?  Because this IS NOT socialism.
You obviously do not know what Socialism is. It’s sad because ‘Ideas’ that is exactly what the Democrats are pushing. Look at the Socialistic countries instead of the mind numbing books that are geared to keep you ignorant here in the US.
