In post-9/11 America, it’s no mystery that racism against the Muslim-American community has increased dramatically. Islamophobia is running rampant, and the new film Torn attempts to expose this issue by exploring the aftermath of a suburban bombing. But while the film has good intentions, the film misses the mark and struggles to rise above the air of TV-movie quality.
Mahnoor Baloch plays a Pakistani-American real estate broker, in “Torn” in theaters on October 25th.
Torn follows the experiences surrounding two mothers as they lose their sons to a local mall bombing. Maryam (Mahnoor Baloch), a Pakistani-American real estate broker, and Lea (Dendrie Taylor), a struggling office custodian, bond over their mutual grief. The two first meet amid the chaos following the explosion, and quickly form a provisional but intimate friendship. The bond, however, is shattered as swiftly as it formed when Maryam’s son becomes a suspect in the attack.
Racism and violence quickly surround the life of Maryam and her husband, Ali (Faran Tahir), as the news leaks to the local community. Her son Walter is depicted as a Muslim teen bitter toward the American culture, and snap judgments place him as the ultimate suspect. Maryam begins to lose her clients, and in one instance a brick is hurled through the family home, with “Terrorists Go Home” vandalized onto the garage door. Ali pleads with his wife to return to their native Pakistan, believing they have no place in this racial environment. Though they are both American citizens, he stresses to his wife, “We are foreigners and we always will be.”
The controversy surrounding Walter soon poisons the two mothers’ new friendship, as Lea tells Maryam, “How can I be your friend? Your son killed Eddie.” This sudden schism represents a rather startling depiction of present-day America. Whereas days earlier the two were emotionally bonded, a sudden news headline destroys any connection toward Maryam that Lea once had.
Torn flips the situation rather suddenly, however, when Lea receives startling news that her son Eddie was harshly bullied in school, and only days before the bombing he threatened to kill his tormentors. As the bullies were causalities of the bombing, Walter is no longer the main suspect, but Eddie is a suspect as well.
This is where things go south. The sudden alignment of the two mothers’ situation comes off as rather contrived and basic, and it appears altogether unrealistic that the two are suddenly plunged into these equalizing situations. In a movie that wishes to present the realistic nature of racism in contemporary America, it relies on a rather unrealistic plot device. If its aim was to attack racial stereotypes, it falls flat and only works to diminish the film’s credibility.
As the two suspects are pitted against each other, Torn quickly devolves into an almost TV-cop mystery of ‘whodunit.’ Though the movie runs at a modest 80 minutes, it struggles to maintain the viewer’s interest with anything more than finding out the true culprit of the attack. And though that question keeps you guessing until the very end, the movie is forced into a genre in which it is not meant to fill. Rather than expounding on the prevalence of racism and prejudice, it merely slowly teases you with the want of closure. The film can’t seem to take off after the initial plot is laid out, and viewers often have to ask themselves if this is more an episode of Law and Order than any sort of cinematic social commentary.
In light of its pitfalls, the film is largely carried by its crisp cinematography and the acting prowess of both Baloch and Taylor, whose reactions to the sudden loss and upending of their lives allows for a sense of connection with the two mothers. Taylor contrasts Baloch with a very rough-around-the-edges persona, and the character’s weathered nature provides for a greater sense of realism and a raw style of grief. Baloch’s representation is much more reserved, eliciting her struggle to maintain the equilibrium of her suburban life and stay afloat in her suddenly racially charged climate.
In the end, Torn will elicit the viewer’s emotions and perhaps even allow for a greater social awareness, but it in no way reaches its true potential. Its premise is enticing on paper, but in practice, Torn just can’t seem to get off the ground. If done properly it had the possibility to have been this year’s dark horse, but instead it falls short in carrying out its intended message.

USC’s men’s tennis team continued its winning ways this weekend, as junior Roberto Quiroz took home the singles championship for the second year in a row at the United States Tennis Association Clay Court Invitational in Orlando, Fla.
Back-to-back · Junior Roberto Quiroz took home the singles title at the Clay Court Invitational for the second consecutive year. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
In last year’s Clay Court Invitational, Quiroz defeated Duke’s Michael Redlicki to earn the singles crown. This year, Quiroz repeated his success by taking down Redlicki’s younger brother, Martin, a high school senior, in the finals.
Quiroz entered the tournament as the top seed, which granted him a bye in the first round. In the second round, he defeated Sameer Kumar, a high school player from Indiana, 6-2, 6-1. Next, he took down North Florida’s Norbert Nemscek, 6-2, 6-2. In the quarterfinals, Quiroz defeated Notre Dame’s Quentin Monaghan, 6-1, 6-2.
These victories earned the Guayaquil, Ecuador native a spot in the semifinals, where he squared off against a fellow Trojan in sophomore Max de Vroome. Last week, these two competed against each other in the doubles championship of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Southwest Regional tournament, where de Vroome and junior Eric Johnson came out on top over Quiroz and senior Ray Sarmiento.
Quiroz avenged the doubles loss by taking down de Vroome 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 to advance to the finals. There, he faced Martin Redlicki, who had not dropped a set throughout the entire tournament. Despite Redlicki’s dominant play throughout the tournament, Quiroz emerged victorious by a score of 7-5, 6-0.
Quiroz also advanced to the quarterfinals of the doubles draw with senior Michael Grant. Johnson and de Vroome also made their way to the quarterfinals, while the young team of freshmen Robbie Bellamy and Nick Crystal fell in the Round of 16.
Grant and Bellamy advanced to the Round of 16 in singles, while Johnson and Crystal fell in the first round.
The Trojans’ recent success is a good sign as the team gears up for the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Indoor Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y.

After the USC women’s volleyball team saw its two-week road trip and 11-match winning streak end with a rare loss last week, the friendly confines of the Galen Center proved to be the perfect environment to get the team back on track.
Smooth sailing · Senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard recorded eight kills and a .889 hit percentage in USC’s 3-0 win over Washington State. – Anna Schwartz | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy felt no lingering effects of their setback at Arizona and recovered to beat the Washington State Cougars 3-0 (25-18, 25-13, 25-19) Friday night to improve to 18-2 and 8-1 in Pac-12 play.
“Anytime you win 3-0 in this conference, you’ve done pretty well,” USC head coach Mick Haley said. “We’ve defended well in this building, so it’s doubly hard for a team that’s rebuilding like Washington State. The score doesn’t reflect how long the rallies went in the first two sets, and I think we ran them out of gas even though they played well.”
Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio once again led the USC attack with 12 kills and 12 digs, her fourth double-double of the season. Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu added 11 kills while hitting .385, and senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard was strong down the middle with eight kills and no errors (.889 hitting percentage).
“We played well and bounced back from a tough loss at Arizona,” senior libero Natalie Hagglund said. “That’s always hard to do. I think we distributed the ball very well and our defense is getting better.”
The first set opened with little wiggle room as USC held an 11-10 lead. The Women of Troy took over with seven points in the next nine rallies, culminating in a kill by junior outside hitter Emily Young that gave them an 18-12 lead. Young knocked down another kill to bring up set point at 24-18 before a Nwanebu strike sealed the set 25-18.
USC gained more separation in the middle frame, going up 12-6 on a Nwanebu kill. The Cougars pushed back but the Women of Troy held them in check, later increasing their lead to 21-12 with Olgard taking a quick pass to knock a kill down the middle. WSU failed to put a dent in the lead and USC won the set 25-13 when Nwanebu combined on a block with sophomore middle blocker Kiara Wright.
USC took care of business in the third set, withstanding a frantic WSU attack to take the set 25-19. After a Wright kill gave USC match point, the Cougars saved two points before Nwanebu ended it with her 11th kill.
The defense was particularly stellar in the first two sets, holding WSU to hitting percentages of .065 and .077, respectively.
“We stayed patient. I remember the first rally of the first game was really long,” junior setter Hayley Crone said. “We were able to win the long rallies, which helped our momentum.”
With the win over Arizona, the Women of Troy pushed their home winning streak to 16. The last time USC lost a home match was Sept. 21 against Oregon. Last season, the Women of Troy finished an outstanding 17-1 at home and are 6-0 at the Galen Center this season. In Washington’s most recent visit to USC, the Women of Troy were victorious in a thrilling five-set win.

You will not be happy with the results of the UW match. Lose 3 sets to 1 in a less than mediocre performance.
This team is not coached well with all the talent available. Too much time on the bench for  Olgard and
Ebony Nwanebu. while # 20 and # 12 take their place on the court with negative results.  Not a fan of Haley’s
offensive strategy at this time. Better assistants needed.

It’s a well-known fact by now that the scholarship restrictions placed on USC in wake of the Reggie Bush scandal have severely handicapped the Trojans this season.
According to the participation chart released to the media by USC’s athletics department, the Trojans used 41 scholarship players and 10 walk-ons during Saturday’s game against Utah.
Now, it goes without saying that a fan would never root for players on his or her favorite team — and hopefully, any other team — to get injured.
But as the number of inactive Trojans has piled up to ridiculous proportions over the past few weeks, I’ve started to think that this seemingly nightmarish scenario might not be such a bad situation for USC after all.
The depth of this squad has been tested since before the season even started. Junior George Farmer and freshman Steven Mitchell both suffered torn knee ligaments before fall camp, initially depleting the wide receiver corps and setting the stage for one of the most discouraging string of injuries I can recall in my time as a sports fan.
Junior wideout Marqise Lee, who came into the season as a legitimate Heisman contender, suffered a severe knee sprain against Arizona State. Senior linebacker Morgan Breslin has missed three games after leading USC with 13 sacks last year. Senior tailback Silas Redd took longer than expected to return from knee surgery and didn’t play in USC’s first five games. Last week, the athletic department announced junior linebacker Lamar Dawson and freshman tailback Justin Davis would miss the rest of the season.
But in these players’ absences, USC has discovered young, capable backups who have been able to prevent disastrous results while gaining valuable experience for the future.
While Lee has been nursing his knee, sophomore Nelson Agholor and freshman Darreus Rogers have filled in admirably. Agholor has performed so impressively that it’s not crazy to think he could push Lee as the team’s leading receiver when the reigning Biletnikoff Award recipient returns to the field.
Redshirt sophomore running back Tre Madden has turned out to be an absolute workhorse and has made his convincing case as the full-time starter — while Redd netted zero yards on 10 carries against Utah, Madden gained 60 yards on 12 carries.
Junior linebacker J.R. Tavai led USC with 11 tackles and two sacks against the Utes in his second start of the season in place of Breslin. In the first, he racked up 3.5 tackles for loss.
Redshirt sophomore linebacker Anthony Sarao, who often spelled Dawson with the first-team defense during fall camp, was USC’s second leading tackler with nine tackles on Saturday in his first career start.
The list goes on and on.
But perhaps what’s most important is that with so many backups getting the chance to take the field, the team’s morale seems to be at an all-time high despite the disturbing number of seemingly debilitating injuries.
When redshirt sophomore tailback Javorious “Buck” Allen scored the first touchdown of his career against Arizona by diving over the pile into the end zone, he was immediately mobbed by his teammates. After the game, multiple players described it as a high point of the season — Allen had just 20 career carries before his breakout game against the Wildcats.
“Everybody said we don’t have depth,” redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey said after the victory. “That’s just a complete lie.”
USC was forced to use former offensive tackles (redshirt junior Nathan Guertler) and defensive ends (senior Kevin Greene) as tight ends against the Utes — and it was entertaining to watch and speculate about who would take the field next.
From here on out, USC fans really won’t know who will line up where on offense. But as long as the Trojans can continue to eke out victories as they did against Utah, I don’t think they’ll care.

The No. 1-ranked Trojans dove back into Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play on Sunday and defeated No. 6 UC Santa Barbara 16-10.
USC (20-1, 2-0 MPSF) pushes their current winning streak to double digits, now standing at 10 games, with the win.
Lead the way · Senior two-meter Connor Virjee posted a team-high five goals in the Trojans’ 16-10 victory over UC Santa Barbara on Sunday. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
 
The Trojans got off to a hot start against the Gauchos, netting three consecutive goals to begin the game before UCSB got its first goal early in the first quarter. It was a high-scoring opening frame, as the two teams added three more goals apiece before the Trojans took a 6-4 lead into the second.
UCSB (15-6, 2-2 MPSF) was able to keep up with the top-ranked Trojans through two quarters, down 9-7 at halftime, but USC’s defense kicked in during the second half, when they limited the Gauchos to only three goals. The Trojans recorded seven goals in the half, with four of those coming in the final quarter of play.
USC head coach Jovan Vavic attested this defensive improvement to the way the Gauchos’ pool is designed.
“It’s the only pool in the conference with a shallow end and in the second half,” Vavic said, “we played defense in the deep end, so offensive players weren’t able to push off the bottom of the pool to gain an advantage.”
Senior goalie James Clark anchored the stout USC defense, with eight saves on the day for the Trojans.
Senior two-meter Connor Virjee did not waste any of his chances to score on offense, tallying five goals on the day, many of them coming during 6-on-5 chances.
“Connor really had a good shooting day for us, especially from the outside in our man-up situations,” Vavic said.
USC converted nine out of its 12 extra-man opportunities on the day, and this paved the way for even more Trojan players to score.
Three USC players recorded hat tricks — Virjee, redshirt junior driver Rex Butler and junior driver Kostas Genidounias. Senior utility player Mace Rapsey also netted two goals.
Senior driver Nikola Vavic, the Trojans’ all-time leading goal scorer, had a quiet day with only one goal, but coach Vavic pointed out that he contributed in other ways.
“Nikola played a large role on offense for us,” Vavic said. “He was drawing a number of ejections, as well as being a facilitator for his teammates, getting assists.”
The team will look to continue its 10-game winning streak up north against another conference opponent in Pacific. The teams play on Saturday, Nov. 2 with game time set for noon.

Despite playing with an injury-depleted roster, USC defeated Utah 19-3 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum behind a dominant defensive performance. The Trojans forced four turnovers and limited the Utes to just 201 yards of total offense.
Heading into Saturday’s game, the team adopted the mantra “Step up” in response to its growing list of injured players. Several backups were forced into larger roles, and they seemed to embrace the team’s new philosophy.
Bittersweet · In the second quarter, freshman safety Su’a Cravens returned an interception 54 yards but suffered an injury on the play. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“We weren’t going to blink,” interim head coach Ed Orgeron said about how the team responded to its numerous injuries. “We weren’t going to use it as an excuse. The words ‘Step up’ and ‘Compete’ were talked about.”
Junior defensive end J.R. Tavai, starting in place of senior outside linebacker Morgan Breslin, led the Trojans with 11 tackles and two sacks. Redshirt sophomore linebacker Anthony Sarao was tied for second on the team with nine tackles on the day while starting in place of junior linebacker Lamar Dawson, who was injured during practice and will miss the remainder of the season. “If you come to USC, you know you can’t have a drop-off [from starters to backups],” Sarao said. “We have a lot of people down, so the backups have to step up because we don’t have depth.”
As if the team’s injury woes could not get worse, the list of players dealing with injuries grew longer during Saturday’s game. Freshman safety Su’a Cravens suffered a strained groin after intercepting a pass near the end of the second quarter, and the Trojans had few options to replace him with. Redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey, who had originally been ruled inactive for the game with a foot injury, changed from street clothes into uniform in the locker room during halftime and played the entire second half.
“That’s just family,” redshirt junior defensive back Josh Shaw said. “We really didn’t have another [option], so Dion told [Orgeron] that he was ready and he suited up and went to war with us.”
Bailey’s return saved USC from being forced to use yet another walk-on during the second half, though he was admittedly at less than full-strength while playing on Saturday.
“I’m nowhere near ready to play at the level I see myself playing at on a normal basis,” Bailey said. “I can barely run, so nobody expected me to play at all.”
Safety Leon McQuay III was another player forced into a starting role against Utah, and the freshman did not disappoint. In his first career start, McQuay had three tackles and an interception, taking advantage of his first opportunity at consistent playing time.
“That guy is a great player,” Shaw said. “For the next three or four years, the Trojan nation should be very excited with the play of Leon McQuay. The guy is a freak — he can do it all.”
After forcing just two turnovers in its past five games, the USC defense forced four against Utah, with three interceptions and one fumble recovery. Unlike the team’s last game against Notre Dame, the Trojans’ offense was able to capitalize on its good field position, with three scores in four red zone opportunities.
Touchdowns, however, remained scarce on Saturday, and the team hopes to find the end zone more often in the future.
“We’re going to watch film and fix it,” Orgeron said. “I thought the offense did some tremendous things today about putting the ball in the red zone. When we watch the film, in the red zone, there will be things that we have to fix, but I have complete confidence in [offensive coordinator] Clay Helton.”
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler delivered another efficient performance, completing 21 of 32 pass attempts for 230 yard with one touchdown and no turnovers. Despite playing with only three scholarship wide receivers and no scholarship tight ends, Kessler was able to develop a strong rapport with his available targets.
“It’s not ideal to have guys go down, and it’s hard to get timing down,” Kessler said. “I’m very proud of how hard these guys worked. In the tight end situation, they stepped up and did great things. Those guys are just team players, family guys. It’s awesome to know you have guys who put the team before themselves.”
Sophomore wideout Nelson Agholor continued his emergence as USC’s primary weapon in the passing game. With junior wide receiver Marqise Lee out, Agholor tallied six catches for 97 yards and one touchdown.
In the kicking game, junior kicker Andre Heidari responded well after having to compete for the starting job during practice. Heidari missed twice in the loss to Notre Dame, but made a career-high four field goals in five attempts against Utah.
“We wanted the competition to be open,” Orgeron said. “We were ready to put in another kicker if we needed to, but [Heidari] did great … I think it was more about a mindset and the competition level that helped him.”
USC plays next Friday, Nov. 1, against Oregon State in Corvallis, Ore.

With the release of Katy Perry’s Prism and Miley Cyrus’ Bangerz, all eyes are on the leading ladies of the music industry — women who have incited both criticism and praise for their recent decisions.
The artists featured in this week’s list are refreshing additions to the recent flood of ladies making waves in the music industry. Some, such as Lorde, have become household names. Others, though less recognizable, are worth your time. So whether you’re a guy or a girl, let these impressive female vocals serve as the backdrop to your week.

“You — (Ha Ha Ha)” — Charli XCX
The name Charli XCX might sound familiar. She’s the bombshell featured in Icona Pop’s single, “I Love It.”
“You — (Ha Ha Ha)” is punchy and energetic. The beats are hypnotic and uniquely Charli XCX; it’s hard to pinpoint her molding to a traditional pop template. Twenty-one-year-old Charlotte Aitchison launched her career at the age of 14, and with tracks like this one, she’ll most likely keep it going for quite some time.
“400 Lux” and “Ribs” — Lorde 
I remember the first time I heard Lorde — like most, it was thanks to the radio. In the middle of my morning commute, I found myself fumbling for Shazam the moment something distinct from the Bruno Mars garbage I had become accustomed to came on.
Plenty of us can admit to belting, “But every song’s like gold teeth, Grey Goose, tripping in the bathroom” with our closest friends, failing to hit any of the notes with her bravado.
Though some expected New Zealand-born Ella Maria Lani Yelich-O’Connor (yes — that’s actually her real name) to fall into relative obscurity after “Royals,” Lorde has proved that her talent is limitless after the release of her much-anticipated album, Pure Heroine. The Huffington Post called Pure Heroine a “lyrical masterpiece,” Billboard magazine praised it as “thought-provoking” and Rolling Stone deemed it “surprisingly real and fully formed.” Regardless of what the critics say, it’s your turn to reach a verdict.
“Burn” — Ellie Goulding
Following the success of “Lights” and “Anything Could Happen,” “Burn” is Ellie Goulding’s most popular new track off her 2013 album, Halcyon Days. In “Burn,” Goulding seamlessly blends elements of electronic music and pop to create this catchy number. But besides devoting her energy to producing killer tracks, Goulding is a passionate philanthropist, frequently partnering with charities and organizations to raise awareness for issues from heart disease to education.
“Raggamuffin” — Selah Sue
Belgian vocalist Selah Sue received unparalleled attention for her fast-paced verses, singing cryptic lyrics such as, “The raggamuffin is one of the friends, and what you see is what you really need in the end / But what you ever gonna gonna do, I don’t know.” The acoustic component of “Raggamuffin” brings a remarkable rawness to the track, which braids strands of reggae and soul into a whimsical melody.
“Mushaboom” — Feist
Though Canadian vocalist Leslie Feist was a well-established musician, she found true international success after Apple featured her catchy track, “1234” in an iPod Nano commercial. Prior to her TV debut, Feist produced plenty of similarly cheerful numbers. Her first single, “Mushaboom,” can be found in Marc Webb’s hit film, 500 Days of Summer.
Feist makes her way onto this week’s playlist not only for her catchy music, but also for having the cojones to leave the band Broken Social Scene to cultivate her own identity. You go, Leslie Feist.
“With Ur Love” — Cher Lloyd
Like Lorde, the spotlight shined on Cher Lloyd at the tender age of 16 — a time when most are concerned about getting their driver’s licenses and passing AP exams, not touring the country to sold-out crowds. Most know her for the angst-ridden, poppy number, “Want U Back,” where she belted, “Remember all the things that you and I did first? / And now you’re doing them with her.” Truthfully, Lloyd’s music isn’t as polished and mature as her peers’ on this playlist, but her sassiness and take-charge attitude make her deserving of a recommendation.

On Friday night, Bovard Auditorium went back in time to the 1960s as the The Beach Boys brought a surf-rock party to the stage as part of Trojan Family Weekend. Parents and students danced and sang to classics such as “Surfin’ U.S.A.,” “Barbara Ann” and “California Girls.” The USC Song Girls also joined frontman Mike Love to remind the audience to “Be True To Your School” as part of a special performance.
Surfin’ USC · The Beach Boys was one of the most successful bands of the 1960s. Their subject matter shifted from talking about the idyllic Southern California lifestyle in 1962’s Surfin’ U.S.A. to dealing with progressive, revolutionary themes on its 1966 magnum opus Pet Sounds. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
The concert featured Love, Bruce Johnston, who joined the band in 1965, along with their band of five additional vocalists and instrumentalists. Founding members Brian Wilson and Al Jardine, and longtime member David Marks, were not present because they were touring with Jeff Beck. The Daily Trojan sat down with Love and Johnston before the concert to talk performing, songwriting and the importance of music education.
 
Daily Trojan: Why did you choose to perform at USC?
Love: We have, in the past, come to USC for various events. One time, we did a show with [rock duo] Jan and Dean … I have a brother who graduated from ’SC. We also did a show at the Coliseum at a USC game for Full House … And they have a really nice modern music program, in addition to where most music programs are jazz or classical but they also have a contemporary music program, which is really good.
 
DT:  How do your own experiences help you guide your daughter as she looks to enter the music industry?
ML: I grew up in a home with a Steinway grand piano, a Lyon and Healy harp and a Hammond organ … so music and singing — harmony — has always been a fact of life. But what I didn’t know anything about was the mechanics of the music industry, and some very unfortunate things arose because of that, so I would advise any young person who loves music, and the art of it … that you should become educated about the music business, sure, but also about business in general, so if you’re fortunate enough to become successful in this industry, you have some knowledge and armed with that knowledge, you can protect yourself better. … Education plays an enormous role in preparation for anything.
 
DT:  The opening act of the concert is comprised of Thornton School of Music students who have written songs inspired by The Beach Boys’ style. Why do you think your music has remained popular across generations?
ML:  I think there’s a lot of warmth in the harmonies, and the feeling that you get when you hear that kind of harmony which we’re known for and we love doing. I think that is a warmth that transcends mountains and nationalities and language groups. It’s truly amazing. If we’re in Japan, we’ll start a song, they’ll hear just any of the songs, and they’ll just roar. … Harmonies, and the warmth of the harmonies, the blend, is really attractive to the ear.
Johnston: He’s being very humble because he wrote all the lyrics. You kind of have to have the lyrics to sing these songs, you know.
 
DT:  What advice do you have for aspiring songwriters?
BJ: Just do it. A song can from any place, and just if it’s the right song, it can be up on a chart one day. Just do it. A little inspiration: I have my funny inspiration…: Go to CVS and read the greeting cards. They’re great. And they have to get right to that message. It’s great discipline if you’re trying to pen a very commercial song.
ML: If you’re going to try to make a life or a career out of music, then know the structure of the music business, understand publishing and perhaps contracts and all that … I think that’s vitally important to become educated, and therefore if you’re in a position to gain knowledge, such as being in a university, that’s great.
 
DT: How do you decide what to play every night?
BJ:  We change it every night. There’s a different set list, this isn’t the horse running back to the barn. Every night there’s a different set list and it keeps you on your toes. We sound check-slash-rehearse. We just did “Please Let Wonder” the other night, probably hadn’t done it for a couple of years, you know, stuff just comes back out on the set list.
ML: We have so many different types of songs, it depends kind of on what the mood is. If the mood is upbeat, maybe it’s “Fun Fun Fun” or “I Get Around” or “Surfin’ U.S.A.” And then there’s a little bit more cerebral stuff, the Pet Sounds album, “God Only Knows,” “Wouldn’t It Be Nice.”
 
DT: How do you adapt to performing without the other founding members?
BJ:  You can still hear Tchaikovsky. You can still hear it all. We have a great music director, Scott Todd. He has helped us restore every note and it’s pristine and it’s in the keys — we always sing in the keys we recorded in — that every note is correct and sounds the way you want it to sound.

Regarding the last question, “How do you adapt performing without the other founding members?” The REAL answer is because Mike Love doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He forgets that he wouldn’t be performing anyplace if it hadn’t been for Brian Wilson PERIOD. Mike Love took advantage of his cousin Brian by stealing the rights to name of the band, while he was not well. What kind of family sues each other? Divorced ones. And the only thing that Bruce Johnston got right is that the REAL Beach Boy sound can be reproduced by any imitator, just like Mike Love does. If it had been Mike Love who suffered from mental illness, drowned, or died from cancer, there never would’ve been any law suits, and the entire surviving band members would be on tour.

Cormac McCarthy is arguably America’s greatest living writer, a restless chronicler of human suffering with a gift for distilling art from atrocity. Ridley Scott is a celebrated filmmaker responsible for hard-edged masterpieces such as Blade Runner and the director’s cut of Kingdom of Heaven. So when it was announced that Scott would be adapting McCarthy’s first original screenplay (not counting an episode of 1977’s PBS-produced The Gardener’s Son) with the aid of a formidable cast including Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt and Penélope Cruz, expectations promptly hit the stratosphere.
Kind of a big dealer · The Counselor boasts an impressive cast, including Michael Fassbender (left) as the counselor and Oscar-winner Javier Bardem (right) as Reiner, an entrepreneur and underground drug kingpin. – Photo courtesy of 20th Century Fox
The result of this white-hot convergence of talent, The Counselor ultimately  fails to live up to its own daunting pedigree and falls on the sword of its own self-importance. That shouldn’t discourage viewers from seeking out this bloodstained gem of a movie, however, which features, among other things: a pair of domesticated cheetahs, an encounter between Cameron Diaz and the windshield of a Ferrari that brings new meaning to the word “autoerotic,” a welcome cameo from Breaking Bad’s Dean Norris and the most aberrant, shocking bouts of violence Scott has put to screen since the infamous “chestburster” sequence in the original Alien.
Equal parts crime thriller and existential nightmare, the film revolves around the eponymous Counselor (Fassbender, playing little more than a well-groomed cipher), a fresh-faced attorney looking to provide for his new fiancée (Cruz) with the profits from a drug deal involving his friend and local nightclub owner Reiner (Javier Bardem). This is the young lawyer’s first dalliance with organized crime, so he seeks out the wisdom of Westray (Brad Pitt), the slick, paranoid middleman with an escape plan for every occasion. This attracts the attention of Reiner’s scheming moll Malkina (Diaz), who has another, infinitely more sinister agenda in mind.
Bardem, who terrified audiences as the monotoned angel of death Anton Chigurh in Joel and Ethan Coen’s No Country for Old Men, is nearly unrecognizable as the spiky-haired, garishly dressed Reiner. Pitt, a character actor tragically trapped in a leading man’s body, seems equally on-point as Westray, a self-conscious country club cowboy who mutters darkly about the cartel using automatic garrotes made from “unholy alloys.”
It’s Diaz, however, who nearly ends up walking away with the whole damn movie. Her Malkina, clad in Bond villainess attire and sporting tattooed cheetah spots to advertise her predatory nature, is a creature far more ferocious and unpredictable than the furry African imports she keeps on diamond-studded leashes. It’s strangely liberating to watch the star of so many safe, forgettable romantic comedies unfurl her freak flag with such Machiavellian gusto. If the film surrounding her had been stronger, Diaz could have found herself an awards season contender for her uncharacteristically nasty, boundary-pushing performance.
Like every Ridley Scott film, The Counselor is a visual treat. Under the practiced eye of director of photography Dariusz Wolski (Prometheus), the sun-scorched vistas of El Paso, Texas quickly transform into a vast, purgatorial wasteland of the soul. Viewers will be forgiven for having the occasional Breaking Bad flashback, especially during a scene involving a semitruck heist and several magnificently choreographed desert shootouts.
Aside from sadly short-lived appearances from Bruno Ganz, John Leguizamo and a host of other fine character actors, The Counselor’s greatest failing is ironically what was supposed to be its biggest draw: McCarthy’s chatty, elliptically plotted script. Much of the dialogue, even the exchanges that probably read beautifully on the page, sounds like a Gordian knot of moral and philosophical bloviating when spoken aloud, even by a brilliant, Oscar-winning performer such as Bardem.
Adapting McCarthy’s spare, lyrical style for the screen has always been a challenge, even for the author himself. No Country for Old Men, which took home four Oscars in 2008, began its life as an unfinished screenplay that McCarthy retrofitted into a novel in order to avoid scrapping the story alogether. John Hillcoat and Joe Penhall’s adaptation of The Road followed the book’s uncompromisingly bleak vision to the letter and paid for it with a disappointing box office haul. Billy Bob Thornton and Ted Tally’s version of All the Pretty Horses, meanwhile, was critically savaged for deviating too far from the source material, turning McCarthy’s attempt at rugged romanticism into watered-down schmaltz.
Scott was long considered the frontrunner to helm the adaptation of McCarthy’s magnum opus, the notoriously “unfilmmable” western epic Blood Meridian. Based on the shortcomings of The Counselor, it’s no longer clear if he’s the man for the job. There was a point when Scott could’ve claimed the material without taming its savage, heretical spirit, but that time may have passed.
The Counselor, a relatively light tale, at least by McCarthy standards, should have been a quick and dirty delight. Instead, the film is little more than an overwrought dime store novel elevated by a few entertaining performances and an admirable go-for-broke ending. Oh well. At least the sight of a huckster lawyer attempting to outsmart the cartel will give viewers cause to think of Breaking Bad’s forthcoming Better Call Saul spin-off and smile.

Twenty-one nations are supporting the effort in the United Nations to restrain the United States’ National Security Agency surveillance program, according to the Foreign Affairs Journal. The concerned nations want the UN  to reaffirm the worldwide right to privacy on the Internet, which the NSA has certainly not been observing over the past few months. This continued spying by the United States is fraying relationships between the country and its allies.
The United States has been transitioning away from hard power, or military force, as a method of exerting its assumed superiority in the world over the past decade. The move makes sense, since American military power is ill-suited to fight the so-called “War on Terror” begun under the Bush administration. As former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wrote in the Foreign Affairs Journal in 2009, American military spending is too high in relationship to the benefit to American power. Simply put, the United States isn’t gaining anything from its military spending.
According to counterinsurgency expert David Kilcullen in his book The Accidental Guerilla, the incredible amount of defense spending during the first few years of the War in Iraq was almost worthless; a better policy would have been a soft- power approach on the ground in Iraq working with civilians. These efforts could have included peace talks and diplomacy. The world is changing, and soft power and economic power now matter more than force, according to Leslie Gelb, the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, in the Foreign Affairs Journal.
Given that hard power is no longer working, the United States is moving toward soft power to try and relate to other countries. This accounts for increased American involvement with world politics, in talks with world leaders such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and greater attention to dealings in the U.N. President Barack Obama appears concerned with the United States’ image in the world, given his remarks during the government shutdown.
“Probably nothing has done more damage to America’s credibility in the world, our standing with other countries, than the spectacle that we’ve seen these past several weeks,” Obama said during a speech at the White House. “It’s encouraged our enemies, it’s emboldened our competitors and it’s depressed our friends who look to us for steady leadership.”
Given this new emphasis on soft power, it is depressing to see the U.S. lose its place in the world because of spying programs. Make no mistake; American spying is hurting our position in the world. As Harvard Professor Joseph Nye, who coined the term “soft power,” said in an interview with Reuters, the spying program makes other world leaders less willing to work with America. And Foreign Affairs notes that, recent allegations from Edward Snowden have made the spying game more personal, leader to leader rather than country to country.
Thus, the espionage program presents a significant problem for soft power: Soft power relies on negotiations and relations, especially between heads of state. If heads of state are uncomfortable with each other, as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil are with Obama, then open and honest relationships are not possible. Without the possibility for these relationships, then the United States cannot rely as heavily on allies.
Cordial world relations and agreements between nations are based on reciprocity; the concept that international entities will hold up their ends of deals based on nothing more than the expectation that the international system requires cooperation and poor relations with other world leaders prevent the United States from entering into agreements based on reciprocity as the country has already violated international norms with its espionage activities.
The world has no basis to trust the United States since the country will violate such fundamental rights as privacy on the Internet or the privacy of other world leaders. The United States has no way to assuage those fears, and no way to work around the issue, without giving up these kinds of spying activities.
Espionage is creating a significant burden on U.S. power. Our interests will likely suffer as a result. In the end, the program is not worth its cost.

If all this espionage was occurring under Bush or any other Repub prez – we would be having a media feeding frenzy. However, since this is happening under the watch of a black, democratic prez – suddenly the media seems rather tame with demanding answers to some tough questions. The only way we will have the media do its due diligence on this topic is to have a white, right wing Prez – then we will be back to shaking our fist at the prez demanding answers.

Last month, the Oneida Indian Nation launched a “Change the Mascot” campaign aimed to rename the Washington, D.C.-based football team, the Washington Redskins. Though it might appear to be of little consequence, the debate over a sports team’s name is not a trivial matter. The routine use of racial slurs, such as “redskin,” is inappropriate and must be taken seriously. As Ray Halbritter, an Oneida Nation representative, told ABC News, “Sports and politics have a really important intersection. Symbolism really matters.”
Though other sports teams such as the Cleveland Indians, have discriminatory names, the Washington Redskins is the worst offender. Not only is “redskin” a racial slur toward Native Americans, but the term can also refer to the practice of scalping Native Americans in battle. According to David Grosso, a Washington, D.C. councilmember, the term “redskin” carries the same weight as the n-word. Aside from its vulgar nature, this term also carries colonialist and imperialist tones. As an alternative, Grosso proposed changing the teams’ name to the Redtails, a nod to the region’s population of redtail hawks.
The debate over the Washington Redskins is a pressing issue, which has even elicited a statement from President Barack Obama.
In an interview with the Associated Press, Obama said, “I don’t know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real, legitimate concerns that people have about these things.” He does not take a decisive enough stance on the issue.
This wavering stance opened up a loophole for the Redskins’ team lawyer, Lanny Davis, to defend the name on the basis of “legacy and tradition.” Yet, this justification should not be a legitimate factor in determining whether to change the team’s name. Racial slurs cannot become normalized in society and media; naming a team after an offensive word does not make it any less harmful. Furthermore, Halbritter noted that this “legacy and tradition” unfairly portrays the Native American as a “historic relic or mascot.”  In a statement to CNN, he added, “No matter what the history of something is, if it’s offending people, then it’s time to change it.”
Kevin Gover, head of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of the American Indian, pinpoints the problematic nature of the Native American-derived sports mascots: “A good many Americans don’t know any Indians … The petty stereotype has become expected.” In USA Today, Gover adds that Native American derived-team names are especially offensive because they incorrectly portray Native Americans as outsiders instead of the original settlers. He takes issue with the stereotypical, 19th century depiction of Native Americans and suggests changing the name to the Washington Americans and modernizing the mascot.
Yet this approach fails to address the issue of belittling a race of people into a sports team mascot. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a mascot is “a person, animal or object adopted by a group as a symbolic figure especially to bring them luck.” Even though the dictionary definition concedes that a mascot can be a person, there are few other races represented in sports teams’ mascots. Instead, the vast majority of mascots are animals, such as the Miami Dolphins or the Arizona Cardinals. The mascot’s emphasis on the negative characteristics of Native Americans, also, is equally troubling.
In addition, the exaggerated cartoons and fan rituals that accompany the mascots add further insult. For example, the Washington Redskins’ Chief Zee disrespects Native American culture by trailing eagle feathers on the ground and the Atlanta Braves’ “tomahawk chop” trivializes and brutalizes the Native American culture.
Though NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell seemed open to discussing a name change, the Redskins’ owner, Daniel Snyder, takes an inconsiderate approach to the matter. In an interview with ABC News, Snyder remarked, “We’ll never change the name. It’s that simple. NEVER — you can use caps.” According to ABC News, 80 percent of area residents would not care if the team changed its name. With this statistic in mind, Snyder has everything to gain by revoking the offensive name and logo.
Racial generalizations, such as the term “redskin,” desensitize people and make them erroneously believe that this type of subtle discrimination is an acceptable social norm. In order to promote respect and dignity for all Americans, Snyder should rename the team.

What drivel!!
I have higher hopes for USC students, even sophomores. The knee-jerk reactionism is tremendous in this one.
It’s unfortunate that even on the liberal side of thought, we still have a fringe who simply don’t get it. They don’t have life prioritized. They don’t understand any bigger picture. They don’t stop and consider, they just react. If you don’t like the name, that’s fine, but stop, take a deep breath, and realize you need to stop trying to enforce what you feel on others. That’s going to be hard at first, you’re going to believe that you have a moral obligation to enforce your feelings on the world, that lives are at stake, and the future of mankind’s ethics are in the balance. But none of that is factually accurate. There are important problems in the world that need fixed, a football team’s name, apparently created with no malice intended, is not one of those problems.
And there’s something else, if you are truly are seeing the light, if you really see a better way, just make your case. In any situation, not just this. Try to convince someone, just yelling “that’s racist” and “you’re evil” isn’t making a case. Use facts, use real people, show how it affects the world in tangible terms, don’t just use codewords that refer to metaphysical concepts and skip the reality. If there’s compelling evidence for your argument to be found in the real world, people will care, if you haven’t already turned them off by being shrill. There’s a reason why 90% of the public is fine with the name, and if you’re thinking they just need “to be educated,” ask yourself what they need to be educated about. Because most of the time when people use that term, it means they need to be educated that you disagree with them so they must be wrong.
This debate is truly ridiculous, and this article has done nothing but affirm my opinion that many Americans have no understanding of the term “racist” in the first place.  There is a constant misunderstanding of the difference between “racist” and “racial”.  Many things have a racial componenet, but are in no way racist.  
Take for example, the illegal immigration debate.  There is NOTHING racist about wanting strinct enforcement of our nation’s immigration policies.  Sure, there is a “racial” component in that hispanics for whatever reasons account for the majority of those who are here illegally, but it is ignorant and incomprehensible to suggest that someone is therefore “racist” because they want illegal immigration stopped.  (It’s ironic of course that another “racial” component to immigration is that our very fair and generous system of immigration actually leads to more hispanics being naturalized as new citizens than any other race group… yet, hispanics are the most vocal in the inane suggestion that our system of immigration is not fair or open.  Wow!)
It is also disturbing to read that this author believes the word “Indian” (as in “Cleveland Indians”) is “discriminatory” or that the term “Redskin” is akin to the “N Word”.  This determination is shocking, and indicative of frightening lack of character and judgment.  We have become a society so obsessed with protecting each other’s feelings that we no longer employ sound reasoning or logic in discussing these issues.  Sports teams that use Native American names or imagery are in fact recognizing the early influence of American Indians around the country, and, understandably, make reference to their bravery or warrior nature while enjoying the competitive spirit of the game.  
This debate is utter nonsense, and must be shut down.  Sports teams must not be bullied into changing their names or mascots, particularly not with this sort of disingenuous and ignorant rhetoric.
Why not change the name? Even if the issue affects 9% of people, listening to them will show that the team administration is  respectful and flexible rather than stubborn and full of greed. It would be a small step towards reconciliation of different ideologies, a model for our whole political system.
The author of this article also claims “Cleveland Indians” is a “discriminatory name”.
Can someone please explain to me how this name is discriminatory? We have really cried wolf so many times when it comes to the issue of race that we now have made real racism a watered issue. Now ppl just internally roll their eyes whenever someone cries being a victim of racism because we have chosen to make football team names racist as well. Good job liberals! you have worn out an important subject by continuing to find victims out of every little rules of  political-correctness.
I think you forgot to mention this poll showing only 9% of Native Americans even find it offensive http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/downloads/political_communication/naes/2004_03_redskins_09-24_pr.pdf
This is only a big deal because the media continues to blow this stuff up out of proportion. They are not using the name in a derogatory way, it really should be a non issue. Your stat that “80 percent of area residents would not care if the team changed its name” could mean several different things, including that 80% of area residents are simply indifferent to the matter, not necessarily that 80% want the name changed as you imply. Furthermore, the vast majority of mascots are not animals as you state– in the NFL alone less than 50% of teams have animals for mascots. 
What about the Fighting Irish, Buccaneers, or Vikings? These mascots negatively stereotype groups of people, but I don’t see anyone up in arms about them. Honestly, if people can’t get past the fact that it is only a sports team and no offense is intended to anyone, then change the logos and mascot, but keep the name. The Redskins will be happy because they’re keeping their name, and the people offended will be happy because it is merely a name, with no mascot or logo invoking Native American culture or ideas attached to it.
“the term “redskin” carries the same weight as the n-word” LOL, and yet you throw around the r-word so freely.
Why do we not have this same outrage over the Minn Vikings? There must be some Scandinavians that are repulsed to the bone over the use of a term that associates a football team to their ancestry. Is the lack of outrage over Vikings because that deals with lily white people and we have to admit there is often hypocrisy whenever we talk about race issues in modern times? BTW – if we carry the logic why some find “Redskins” offensive – then we are going to need to stop using that word not just for football teams but for any reason. We will start to whittle our lexicon down for fear of offense until we only have “plain vanilla” to communicate with each other. Let’s stop the retarded word policing and focus on real problems – not this first world nonsense.
“The debate over the Washington Redskins is a pressing issue” is THE funniest thing I’ve read in a newspaper in years. Thanks. RJ USC ’88

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism launched a partnership with Adobe Systems on Wednesday evening, in which the full Adobe Creative Cloud was made available to students, faculty and staff of the school free of charge. The contract, which ends in October 2016, will possibly be extended as a long-term fixture in the developing Annenberg curriculum in conjunction with future classes in Wallis Annenberg Hall.
Partners · Adobe Enterprise Account Manager Mike Riley answers questions about the benefits of the new collaboration between USC and Adobe Systems. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
Annenberg students will be able to download software spanning the entire “enterprise version” of the Adobe Creative Cloud, which includes programs such as Photoshop, InDesign and Premiere Pro. The suite, which costs $600 annually to the general public, is available for free to all students majoring or minoring in an Annenberg discipline, as well as graduate and Ph.D students, faculty and staff. This is not Adobe’s first university collaboration, but it is the first to focus the use of Adobe programs on such an individualized level.
James Vasquez, Annenberg’s assistant dean of operations, emphasized the critical role Adobe programs will play in the future of the school.
“Three years ago, we had a discussion of technology, infrastructure and pedagogy in our curriculum, which we are now calling the 21st century digital literacy initiative and, as part of that, we identified a common set of skills that all Annenberg students graduate with,” Vasquez said. “The new building gave us the opportunity to think through what type of resources to buy for our space, and since students have flexibility in mobile devices — whether it be laptops, tablets or phones — we need to provide them the right software.”
Administrators said they were initially attracted to Adobe’s platform agnostic designs, which operate across all devices. The university first approached Adobe Systems a year and a half ago with the idea of collaborating. Currently, Annenberg is working on fully integrating the software into classrooms.
“We are combining a series of free workshops starting in the spring and a certification process next school year,” Vasquez said. “Students will be able to become certified professionals in Photoshop and other tools, and can add this on their resume. We are also setting up a ‘genius bar’ in our new building for students to get software and hardware questions answered.”
New classes, programs and disciplines to highlight Annenberg’s digital literacy initiative are under development. Using the Adobe Creative Cloud as the centerpiece, the literacy effort has big plans to make headway in the technology-laden field of contemporary communication and journalism.
Students are excited for what the future might hold with the new changes that come along with Adobe’s presence on campus. Ryan Lim, a sophomore majoring in business administration who works as a campus representative for Adobe, believes the partnership will improveme student efficiency.
“My fellow representatives and I have been showcasing the many uses for Adobe applications for students of all academic backgrounds,” Lim said. “For example, we will be having an upcoming workshop on building creative resumes and business cards. I think this partnership is a step in the right direction, and I’m glad to see Adobe become more accessible to USC students.”
The innovations that Annenberg has in store are already garnering attention from its students, who are looking forward to using the new utilities in their classrooms and at their fingertips.
“I’m in a marketing class where we have to make a creative campaign, so we will be trained in Adobe. It’s awesome that we can put it on our resumes and get hands-on experience with skills that are necessary in a communications field,” said Hannah Gilden, a senior majoring in communication and Spanish.
Yang Liu, a junior majoring in communication, also said the Adobe partnership will be beneficial to her studies.
“I don’t have Photoshop on my computer right now, so that will be helpful for my web publishing class. I’m planning on taking a visual arts elective next semester which will involve movie editing, and Adobe will be extremely useful to me,” Liu said.
Students were also enthusiastic about what the new partnership, expanding curriculum and building expansion mean for Annenberg’s future.
“I’m so excited to be a part of what Annenberg is doing in establishing itself as the leading communication center of Los Angeles,” said Jillian Morabito, a sophomore majoring in public relations.

Former Los Angeles mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa has been appointed a professor of the practice of policy at the Sol Price School of Public Policy.
In a press release sent out by the university last Friday, USC said Villaraigosa “will work on innovative, large-scale approaches to the significant policy issues facing California.”
His role as a professor of the practice of policy is reserved for individuals “who have made significant contributions in the public practice of their field of expertise,” according to the release.
Villaraigosa previously served as the mayor of Los Angeles from 2005 to 2013. His tenure included increasing funding for public transportation, reforming and expanding the city’s police department and working toward the improvement of public education. Prior to this, he served on the California State Assembly for six years, two of which as the speaker of the Assembly.
Villaraigosa will lecture at both the undergraduate and graduate level on a variety of topics, ranging from sustainable urban development to executive leadership in the public sector.
Dean Jack H. Knott of the Price School of Public Policy said Villaraigosa’s role will be an important contribution to the development of Price students.
“He will be a professor of practice and this is an important element of the kind of education students in a professional school receive,” Knott said. “It’s very important they be connected to the world of practice, that they have an opportunity to react with someone who’s played leadership roles in both [Los Angeles] and nationally.”
In collaboration with USC, Villaraigosa will also spearhead the Initiative for Restoring the California Dream. Knott said the initiative will center around issues such as transportation, infrastructure and public safety.
“It’s an initiative to really focus on the future of California, addressing some of the key issues of the state that are important and our school has some expertise in.”
The former mayor said he is intent on utilizing his prior experiences and strengths at USC.
“The Price School is one of the nation’s leading policy schools, with particular strengths in my own policy interests, such as transportation and infrastructure development,” Villaraigosa said in a press release. “I am excited about working with the school to propose solutions to some of the state’s and nation’s critical policy challenges.”
Over the past year, Villaraigosa was a part of various events and engagements with the Price School. These events were where the relationship between USC and the former mayor began, Knott said.
“Students found [Villaraigosa] very engaging and he enjoyed it, so we expressed interest in whether or not he wanted more engagements with the school,” Knott said. “He said he’d like to explore it, so [the appointment] came from that relationship.”
In addition to the teaching position, Villaraigosa has also recently accepted advisory contracts with global public relations firm Edelman and nutritional products company Herbalife Ltd., according to the Los Angeles Times. Knott stated these other appointments should not interfere with his work at Price.
“We worked out a set of activities that he would be engaged with at USC,” Knott said. “He’s committed to it and so are we. That’s what we’re focusing on.”
Deborah Natoli, an associate teaching professor and director of the professional doctorate program at the Price School, noted the excitement among staff in light of the announcement.
“We had a faculty meeting [Friday morning] and the energy is just abounding,” Natoli said.
Natoli believes Villaraigosa will be a valuable asset to the USC community.
“I see Villaraigosa, I think we all do, as a recognized national leader who’s fulfilled the American dream,” Natoli said. “His coming to the Price School lives our mission because we’re a school that talks about turning theory into action and changing the world, and one life can change the world and [Villaraigosa] is an example of that.”
Knott also said he thinks Villaraigosa’s work at USC will prove incredibly beneficial.
“I think he’s going to help us in bringing people together as a conveyor, allowing us to have dialogue around some of these major issues in a way that we wouldn’t be able to do without his presence here,” he said.

“No matter where you are on campus, if you listen really hard, you can always hear an Asian language,” Andrew Liu said. “That always makes me feel good — feel at home.”
A sophomore majoring in music industry, Liu came to USC in 2012 from his native Singapore and found a place within the university’s multiethnic Asian community.
Born in Chicago in 1994 to a Taiwanese family, Liu spent the majority of his life in Singapore, where he attended the United World College of South East Asia, a British international school where the curriculum was taught in English.
“The way to describe me is TCK — third culture kid,” Liu said. “My passport citizenship, my heritage and where I live now reside in completely different cultures.”
Liu is just one of the approximately 9,200 students who make up USC’s growing Asian community, which accounts for approximately 23 percent of the total undergraduate and graduate population. Of the 7,889 international students, a group that makes up 12 percent of the student population, over three-fourths are from Asian countries.
But for all the Asian community is, the diversity and complexity within the 23 percent is often overlooked — clouded by stereotypes and preconceptions that numbers alone often keep hidden.
What’s Beneath The Number 23
“Within the 23 percent, [the Asian community is] extremely diverse,” said Mary Ho, director of the Asian Pacific American Student Services, a division of USC Student Affairs. “USC categorizes students by breaking it down into 13 subgroups, but as a community we have over 40 ethnic subgroups.”
With all of the underrepresented minorities on campus, some advocates felt that the diversity of the Asian community is often overlooked.
“We forget about how diverse the Asian-American community is,” said Gloria Kim, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly. “When we think about Asian-Americans, we usually only think about Chinese-Americans or Korean-Americans.”
APASS aims to support the Asian-Pacific American student community through leadership and empowerment programs, catering to a multitude of backgrounds including Chinese, Taiwanese, Indian, Filipino and Pacific Islander.
“We have a space for students to come through and learn about themselves specifically through the lens of their racial and ethnic identity,” Ho said. “We have opportunities for them to find their own space, to find their own meaning and their own narratives.”
Serving the university’s Asian-American community since 1982, APASS was established in order to address the needs of the growing Asian-Pacific American student population and connect them with alumni. Pauline Ng Lee, who graduated in 1986, said that APASS was a source of guidance and cultural familiarity during her time at USC.
“It was the fact that there were Asian students and the commonality of being Asian-American and experiencing the same cultural background,” Lee said. “The cultural values were the same — the idea of honoring and respecting your values, work ethic and responsibility.”
The diversity of the Asian community on campus, however, isn’t entirely new. Catalina Camia, who also graduated in 1986, said the Asian-American community was growing exponentially during her time at USC more than 20 years ago.
But this isn’t unique to USC. Even within the professional world, Camia, a reporter for USA Today, said the community’s divisions largely go unnoticed. She recalled a time when a colleague asked her how she celebrated Chinese New Year. She had to explain that, as a Filipino-American, she does not observe the holiday.
“Asian-Americans are one of the fastest growing groups in the country and they’re much more diverse than people realize,” Camia said. “We’re not all alike.”
As diverse as the Asian community is, some students said the greater campus does not perceive the diversity, particularly when it comes to the perception of South Asian students.
Sayuli Bhide, an Indian-American sophomore majoring in neuroscience, said the application of Asian as a broad term often results in a divide within the Asian community itself.
“When I hear the word ‘Asian’ thrown around, most of the time I don’t feel like I identify,” Bhide said. “Technically my race is Asian, but if I were to describe myself as Asian I think most people would raise some eyebrows.”
Ho said this stems from the fact that the community is so intrinsically diverse.
“It does go back to the fact that we are a very diverse community,” Ho said. “There’s no singular event that defines us.”
A Shocking Tragedy
In the spring of 2012, however, the death of two Chinese international students shook many students within the Asian community.
When graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu left China to study in the United States, they planned to  earn masters’ degrees in electrical engineering at USC. But in the early hours of April 11, 2012, the two students’ plans were tragically cut short. At 1 a.m. that morning, the Los Angeles Police Department responded to the scene on the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue where Qu and Wu were found shot and killed.
Police discovered that a gunman opened fire on Qu’s car in a robbery attempt gone awry, according to the Daily Trojan. Though Wu was found in the car, the location where Qu’s body was found suggests that he attempted to run for help before collapsing on a porch.
The attack prompted a gathering of hundreds of students and faculty members in front of Tommy Trojan that Wednesday evening as part of a vigil to honor the lives of the two students. Students who attended the vigil said the majority of those in attendance were members of the Asian international community.
Sarah Leung, a junior from Hong Kong majoring in history and choral music, said being with students of similar backgrounds made her feel connected to Qu and Wu.
“I definitely can relate to [the shooting] more because even though I don’t know the two people, I identify them as people from my own country, so I think there’s more connection between me and the two people,” Leung said. “There’s a string that connects everyone from the same place.”
With 38.5 percent of the university’s international students coming from China, the news of the shooting made headlines across the globe.
“My mom heard about it on the Chinese news,” said Amy Yee, a senior majoring in business administration and computer science. “A lot of international families were questioning the security of USC.”
Beyond The Sea
Despite sharing similar ethnic and cultural values, Anh Cao, a junior majoring in business administration and cinematic arts, said the international and domestic students on campus rarely intermingle.
“There are two populations,” Cao said. “There’s the international population and there’s the Asian-American population from the States.”
As a Chinese-American alumna, Lee said these differences ultimately stem from different upbringings.
“There’s a cultural difference between being an Asian-American and a foreign national,” Lee said. “We weren’t immigrants — we were full-blown Americans raised in the American culture.”
According to Stan Rosen, a professor of political science who specializes in Chinese politics and culture, the divisions within the international Asian community are not particularly surprising.
“We have over 2,500 students from mainland China, so they already have a community amongst themselves,” Rosen said. “And it’s increasing.”
Cao said the growing disparity between the two communities, particularly within the distinct student organizations, has led to a sense of exclusivity.
“I have definitely heard stories of many students who want to join ISA who aren’t international but don’t feel as welcome, or vice versa,” Cao said.
As a member of both Asian-American and international organizations, Liu said the communities often feel separated.
“I am a part of the Taiwanese Student Association and the Taiwanese American Organization,” Liu said. “TSA is a lot more internationally focused. And though it’s great for someone like me, it’s very exclusive.”
Though events are occasionally sponsored by ISA and APASA, Cao said the inherent separation between the two organizations makes it difficult to foster lasting bonds.
“I know a lot of organizations do try to do that,” Cao said. “It’s just really hard to break barriers.”
Shirley Chu, an undeclared freshman born and raised in Seattle, said the disparity within the Asians in the greater campus communities can often leave students feeling out of place.
“Being an Asian-American means you’re not really accepted by the international students because you grew up here,” Chu said. “But you’re also not completely recognized by the domestic students either because you’re Asian, so they tend to assume you’re international.”
‘Oh, you speak English so well!’
Preconceived assumptions and stereotypes of the Asian student population serve as a primary impediment for the university to truly understand the Asian community.
“The biggest ones that I’ve encountered are being really good in school, especially with science and math,” Cao said. “There’s being not so good at English, being a bad driver, being very quiet and submissive.”
For many students, these stereotypes often cast those in the Asian community as perpetual foreigners.
“I get the ‘Oh, you speak English so well!’ comment all the time,” said Liu, an international student from Singapore. “It never occurs to people that I can speak both languages really well.”
Domestic students also deal with the perpetual foreigner stereotype. Chu said some classmates often assume she is an international student.
“Some people are surprised that I can speak English,” Chu said, “and I grew up in Seattle.”
Yee, who serves as Asian Greek Council President, said one of the hardest stereotypes to battle is the belief that Asian students are antisocial. AGC, which is composed of three sororities and two fraternities, aims to develop both the social and professional networks of the university’s Asian community.
“The biggest stereotype I’ve heard is that Asian-Americans are very quiet and studious and keep to themselves,” Yee said. “But being in Asian Greek, we have a very social culture.”
Despite this, however, Yee said the stereotype of being anti-social often elicits surprise when her classmates realize she is in a sorority.
“Sometimes I’ll be wearing my letters in classes, and people say ‘Whoa, you’re in a sorority?’” Yee said. “I think since we get hit so hard with the stereotype, people sometimes get surprised when they hear you’re in a sorority or fraternity.”
There is still a sense of awareness of the differences between the AGC houses and the Interfraternity Council houses, Yee said, citing how students have taken to calling AGC fraternity Beta Omega Phi “Asian Beta” so as not to be confused with IFC fraternity Beta Theta Pi.
“I don’t think it’s an appropriate name for them,” Yee said. “It’s stereotyping the fraternity — it’s not even 100 percent Asian.”
Lee said many of the stereotypes that existed on campus while she was a student in the ’80s still persist today.
“The stereotypes that we had in ’86 are probably the same that exist in 2013,” Lee said. “You always have the stereotype that they tend to be hardworking and not outspoken; that they’re not leaders.”
A former Student Government president, Lee said she was able to combat the stereotype with the support of those within the Asian community.
“People always think Asian-Americans don’t have the capacity to lead,” Lee said, “and that’s false.”
Cao acknowledged there are certainly some who express certain aspects of the stereotypes associated with the larger community, but feels it’s unfair to assume that the stereotypes apply to everyone.
“I’m very outspoken and I like to speak my mind,” Cao said. “I’m not that quiet, submissive person. But I think within all demographics, there’s always someone who falls within any category. People see what they want to see, and that’s been the trend for a while.”
Building Bridges, Breaking Barriers 
As a former campus leader, Lee encouraged the Asian student community to combat the preconceived stereotypes and strengthen the diverse population through leadership.
“Watch the leaders you admire and respect,” Lee said. “Undertake leadership positions and do something different — break that barrier.”
The increased unity between international and Asian-American groups could not only benefit the Asian community as a whole, but could also allow the rest of the student body to understand the Asian community better.
“I think having more Asian cultural events would be nice,” Chu said. “We could attract more people and they can start to see the difference between, for example, Chinese and Korean holidays.”
With a continually expanding and diverse population, Yee said that more intermingling between Asian domestic and international students could strengthen the community.
“A lot of international students come to study in America to be integrated in the culture and learn more about American culture, and Asian-Americans can help with that,” Yee said. “I think we all can learn a lot from each other.”

Excellent article.  I believe it would also be helpful for some more awareness from students of other races (i.e. the greater USC community, as well as the international and Asian-American communities) to the diversity of Asian students and the fact that not all Asians belong in a neat stereotype.  These conversations have gained little traction in recent years, but hopefully that will change when people grow to appreciate diversity of all forms.
