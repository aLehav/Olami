Three Undergraduate Student Government presidential tickets discussed topics such as racism in Greek life, reforming the Department of Public Safety and navigating a return to campus amidst coronavirus health concerns during Thursday’s presidential debate.
The event marked a yearly tradition of hosting a USG presidential debate, which usually takes place in the Wallis Annenberg Hall, however, this year’s event took place over Zoom. Candidates and attendees dialed in remotely, with attendance reaching over 100 students eager to hear the candidates before voting opens on Feb. 17.
Kate Lý Johnston and Emily Bonilla, the moderators of the debate, offered candidates a strict format where each ticket delivered an opening statement followed by two-minute question and answers, rebuttals, closing statements and audience questions and answers. Similar to the last U.S. presidential debate, moderators would disconnect mics for candidates that exceeded the given time limit. 
Shreya Chaudhary, a junior majoring in business administration and chief communications officer for USG, began her opening statement by offering a month by month breakdown of her campaign’s plans and their day one actions, which include setting up bi-weekly luncheons and meetings with the USG Senate. 
After Chaudhary, Alexandra Gill, a junior majoring in business administration, opened with an outsider sentiment, stating she “has not participated in USG before” and calling for “no more career politicians.” 
Alexis Areias, who currently serves as a USG Senator and is running for president, began her opening statement by emphasizing that “students demand the support they deserve,” citing issues including health care and diversity courses. 
Areias, her running mate Lucy Warren, and Chaudhary –– all of whom have served with USG in some capacity before this campaign –– have had the opportunity to experience USG from within. Vice Presidential candidate Antonio Okeke, a sophomore majoring in public policy and business administration who is running alongside Chaudhary, has no prior USG experience nor have Gill and her running mate Del Wood, a sophomore majoring in international relations and global business. Gill and Wood have positioned themselves as self-proclaimed “outsiders.”
“[Wood and I] haven’t fallen into the pattern of inaction,” Gill said. “I currently cannot think of any radical change that USG has made during my academic time here at USC. I’m waiting for change. I demand change. And if they’re not going to do it, I’ll do it myself.”
Following opening statements, moderators directed the conversation towards the coronavirus pandemic and the eventual return to campus. Areias and Warren, the first ticket invited to speak, stressed the need for professors to show empathy towards students as well as providing access to mental health resources and implementation of a university-wide notification system should a student suffer a coronavirus related hardship.
“If you get [the coronavirus], or have an unfortunate death in the family … you’re able to notify a professor immediately and all your professors simultaneously,” said Warren, a junior majoring in economics. “As well as working on on-line classes and ensuring students still have those options once they return to campus.”
On the topic of campus post coronavirus, Chaudhary and Okeke proposed “Trojan Experience,” a platform for students to further learn about aspects of coursework, housing and activities that they may have missed by not being on campus.
“We want to ensure that we can help students best make up for the time they’ve lost,” Chuadhary said.
Following Chaudhary, Gill cautioned students might be “overly indulgent” when it comes to things like “partying” and “recreational activities” upon returning to campus.
“What we need to do in terms of student wellness is give them the resources to make mistakes and then correct [their] own behavior,” Gill said.
The candidates also discussed the future of Greek life, focusing on two fronts: mental health and racism. Okeke said he wanted to aid Greek life “with its mission right now with overdose training.”
The connection of mental health and substance abuse to Greek life was echoed by Areias. As part of their campaign, Areias said she and her team look to partner with USC Trojan Awareness Combatting Overdose to make drug testing strips available. 
On combating racism in Greek life, Gill issued a call for unity and said “we need to respect the fact that they’re making active efforts.” With Wood adding caution that the issues surrounding Greek life “are so deeply ingrained in our structure.”
The other tickets said they want to hold Greek life accountable but raised concerns over the working limitations between USG and Greek.
Johnston also guided part of the conversation Thursday evening to USC’s Department of Public Safety and how candidates plan to work with the department.
“Rather than abolishing [DPS] completely, because that is not practical while living in South Central L.A., instead, we want to give students the opportunity to work alongside and shadow the institution,” Gill said.
In response, Warren rejected Gill’s sentiment, with her running mate Areias calling for “radical change within [DPS].” Chaudhary said she wants to provide DPS with the training to “be better allies of the community.”
“I spent a lot of time this year working with Chief [John] Thomas, and I respect him as a person, but DPS doesn’t stop crime; we report crimes to DPS,” said Jaya Hinton, a junior majoring in business administration and co-director of Black Student Association, to the Daily Trojan. “That’s not what they’re there for. Really all they do is terrorize Black and brown students when they’re on campus.”
In 2013, Los Angeles Police Department officers responded to a noise complaint made against a party that was predominately attended by Black students. The incident escalated when over 70 officers in riot gear were called in to the scene, culminating in multiple Black students being detained. Students protested in response, calling out racial profiling at the hands of the officers and DPS at the scene. 
This event was not a standalone: Following a shooting on campus in 2012, there was — and continues to be — an increased state of policing, particularly against Black students and community members.  
Throughout the debated issues of public safety and the future of DPS, the Zoom chat made a recurring appearance during the evening as a place for audience members to engage live with the forefront topics. An issue that sparked contentious commentary was the platform presented by Gill and Wood allowing students to have certain weapons on campus, including pepper spray and tasers.
“How, in one of the most violent cities in the U.S., do the other candidates justify defunding DPS?” Gill said. “We want students to be able to protect themselves, even if they don’t have faith in DPS.”
Following the back-and-forth on DPS, many students took to the chat –– most describing their dissent for arming students while some asserted their support for the proposal. Ending with audience question-and-answer, students were allowed to ask questions of the candidates as well as moderators addressed questions raised in the chat.
“It’s nice to see people involved in the school, that they care about the stuff and making a change,” said Serena Allen, a senior majoring in public policy and director of outreach for Shreya Antonio 2021, to the Daily Trojan.
Voting will take place from Feb. 17 to 19. The winning ticket is slated to be announced Feb. 23 during USG’s Senate meeting.

Traveling to Lesbos, Greece last February to help provide refugees with more viable shelter conditions for her “Innovation in Engineering and Design for Global Challenges” course group project, Lauren Yen saw how many refugee camps struggled with the current system of maintaining health documentation, leading to misdiagnosis and difficult-to-process medical information.
Yen, a senior majoring in biological sciences, said she spoke with Radwan Faashtol, one of the camp’s clinicians, and that together they discovered issues with documentation records and its paper-based system, such as maintaining accurate records and sharing medical information within the camp.  
“Everything was done unconnected so people would have their own papers stashed away,” Yen said, adding that the refugees were unable to access their information. 
Following travel restrictions and worldwide government lockdowns, Yen and her classmates returned to the United States early-March. With underserved refugees at risk of catching the disease, the pandemic also further emphasized the need for an electronic system in camp medical clinics to address the needs of their patients, according to the Frontida Records website. 
In response to the camp’s records situation, Yen, along with a group of Viterbi School of Engineering students, established Frontida Records, a nonprofit startup organization designed to create a modular, cloud-based health documentation system to serve patients and clinicians. Frontida Records, conceived last March, provides patient portals for Greek residents to access medical records on mobile and track diseases and outbreaks in their region.  
The nonprofit, which currently functions as a beta test in Greece, consists of 13 listed members, and is supported by Viterbi faculty and students, and has partnered with two organizations: Crisis Management Association, Greece and Floating Doctors, Panama.
After returning from Lesbos, Yen collaborated with now co-founder Laura Roed and a team of engineers, businesspeople and fundraisers to create a more digital record system. After being sent home from campus, the planning behind Frontida Records pivoted online. Working alongside Faashtol, Yen and Roed collaborated to ensure that Frontida Records established a digital record system.
Roed, a senior in the Iovine and Young Academy, researched different electronic health record systems with Yen. Within two months, Roed and Yen concluded their design of the system and recruited engineers to help build the app from scratch. 
“You have no idea, when you start working on an app, how complicated it really is, because it’s like, ‘Oh, it’s only going to be five pages,’” Roed said. “Then it turns out it’s actually going to be 20 pages, because there’s all of these intermediary things that you need to do.”
Along with preventing the team from coming together, the pandemic also influenced the design software created by the engineering team, as the software had to adapt to changes the pandemic brought along. Team engineer Kristof Osswald said they had to develop a triage system — a system that determines the level of care a patient should receive. He said it was a slow process that involved eight people volunteering their time. 
Osswald also said the team explored a series of low code options and no code options as a way to keep up with the changing conditions of the environment in the refugee camps. In other words, the applications can be altered with minimal knowledge of coding.
As a startup working with personal patient data, Frontida Records also needed to comply with data regulation and human rights laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation and the Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act. Complying with laws and regulations allowed the organization to provide the highest quality service, Yen said. 
“It takes quite fastidious care to ensure that what we’re doing is compliant,” Yen said. “A lot of our team members did spend a lot of time investing in understanding GDPR, running through many, many pages of GDPR and HIPAA to truly understand, in addition to having interviews with people [to advise us] … we’re also trying to get our systems checked by experts in the field. So we’re trying to give the highest quality care as well as the safest quality care possible with our due diligence.”
Setting up Frontida Records required communication from teammates across the United States and the world, including China and areas with 10-hour time differences according to Quincy Guenther, who operates the business and strategy side of Frontida Records. Despite the challenge of communicating between different time zones, the struggle was worth it, Yen said.
“This isn’t like a seasoned team of seasoned veterans in terms of [electronic health records collection], development and design and all that kind of stuff,” said Guenther, a senior majoring in neuroscience. “We’re learning as fast as we can, testing things as fast as we can and trying to iterate so that we can build a great thing for them.”
After officially launching the app in October, the startup received suggestions from clinicians to fix user errors and add features for both creating schedules and sorting patients. Since adding those features, reception has been positive, with clinicians able to process patients more easily.  
“Every week for like two months, we were able to keep iterating on the product and keep improving it,” Roed said. “It got to the point where we don’t get that much feedback now because they’re just using it, they’re happy with it.
Following the organization’s success, Frontida Records has been entered into various competitions including NAE COVID-19 Call for Engineering Action, SLINGSHOT 2020 COVID-19 Challenge and Maseeh Entrepreneurship Prize Competition. 
Yen said the organization has possible plans to expand to other regions, such as South America and the Caribbean, and train others to use the systems they have created. Members of the team said they appreciate their experience and part in Frontida Records.
“It’s not just another coding project or something you’re doing for a class,” Osswald said. “It’s actually getting into the hands of people who can really use it. You’re getting to actually be a part of what they’re trying to do.”

Eighty percent of Americans don’t personally know a transgender person, so their entire perception of the transgender life comes from what they see in the media: This is the issue that the documentary “Disclosure” explores in depth.
USC’s Visions and Voices held a screening of the documentary Wednesday, followed by a virtual discussion with filmmakers to further examine how the depiction of transgender people in the media impacts the public’s understanding of their lives off-screen.
The discussion included “Disclosure” Director Sam Feder, as well as Jen Richards, a writer and actress who appears in the documentary and Alexandra Billings, an actress and professor at the USC School of Dramatic Arts, who also appears in the film. The conversation was moderated by Michael Renov, the vice dean for Academic Affairs at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. 
The conversation began by discussing the process of making the film, which premiered at Sundance last year and was released on Netflix June 19. Feder said that instead of presenting the film as a chronological history of transgender depictions in media, he wanted to structure it in a way that inspired change in the viewer.
The documentary featured several interviews with notable transgender actors and creators in the film industry, such as Laverne Cox, Mj Rodriguez, Brian Michael Smith and Lilly Wachowski discussing their views on various portrayals of transgender characters in film and television. These portrayals affected their own views of their identities because popular depictions of transgender characters as villains, comic relief or deceptive tricksters caused them to see themselves negatively. Many of the interviewees on “Disclosure” also touched on how they broke into the entertainment industry and how the roles they have been offered have changed over time. 
Feder explained how he saw these sections of the film as more than just interviews, saying “we’re seeing these people come to realizations in real time, processing information, remembering something they hadn’t thought about in decades.”
Richards pointed out that while Feder is never actually seen in the film, an important element of the interviewees is that each of them was having these conversations with him and that the filming was a collaborative process. Billings added that the most important part of making the film was the creation of a familial space.
“We could recognize and remind […]each other that not only are we here, but that we will continue to be here,” Billings said.
When asked about his collaborators on the film, Feder stressed the importance of working with transgender filmmakers. He prioritized hiring and mentoring transgender people throughout the production process and responded to critics who told him he should focus on hiring “the best” people by saying “trans people are the best people for this film.”
He worked with several executive producers that represented the transgender community in Hollywood, including Cox, and stressed the importance of working with others that share your vision.
“I finally understand that you have to build your team,” he said.
Audience member Rui Machida asked the panelists whether they think stories about transgender people should only be made by transgender people. Richards responded by saying that she has struggled with similar issues in her own writing. She offered the advice that any cisgendered person who wants to tell a transgender story should involve multiple transgender people in the process, and make sure that they understand the history of transgender stereotypes so that they don’t perpetuate them.
Billings drove the point home by asking a simple question: “Think about how you want to be treated. If someone’s telling your story, how would you want to be represented?”
Toward the end of the discussion, professor Renov asked the panelists about what they think the film’s impact has been so far. Billings brought up that her followers on TikTok have learned about her transgender identity from the film, and even though they spam her with somewhat discriminatory comments, she is happy to know that they have watched the film and started the process of learning to accept transgender people.
“Even though it’s transphobic and it’s awful and it can be triggering, it shows me that there is a change in the air,” she said.
Richards stated that she was brought onto the creative team behind “Clarice,” a new TV spin-off of “Silence of the Lambs,” because the creators wanted to create a role for a transgender character that would correct the mistakes of the original film, which depicted a violent transgender serial killer. A few days before Wednesday’s panel, it was announced that Richards would play the role she helped create. Richards believes this will be  one of the direct impacts of “Disclosure,” showing how the film industry is already taking steps to change. 
“We’re starting at a different point in the conversation that allows us to go so much further,” she said. 
Feder agreed with Billings and Richards and said that the greatest impact of the film is beyond the fact that it inspires empathy.
“We have this idea of empathy, and empathy is great, but what is empathy without action?” he asked, going on to describe how his film has been used in workplaces and courtrooms to educate about biases against transgender people, creating real change in the off-screen lives of the transgender community. 
“I never imagined not only how quickly it seemed to have an impact, but how vast it’s been,” he said. “To see that people are feeling a sense of empathy and connection and then taking action after that is mind-blowing.”

“The United States vs. Billie Holiday” follows the real life story of legendary jazz vocalist Billie Holiday as she was targeted by the FBI for singing songs that brought attention to the injustices that Black people endured during the 1940s. 
The FBI could not arrest Holiday because of her music, so they decided to exploit her drug abuse problem. Despite actions taken against her by the FBI, Holiday continued to use her talent to shed light on the racist injustices that white people carried out against Black people.
This film shows that Holiday was more than a jazz singer — she was a person who stood up for civil rights during a time where there was no movement to support her. 
Wednesday night, American Cinematheque livestreamed a prerecorded Q&A session with Andra Day, who plays Billie Holiday in the film, and Lee Daniels, the director. The focus of the conversation shifted between many topics ranging from production decisions to cookouts. 
When asked by moderator Jim Hemphill, a filmmaker, why he decided to make this film, Daniels said the story had to be told for two reasons. 
“When you think of civil rights leaders, you think of Martin Luther King, you think of Gandhi, you think of Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, but you don’t think of Billie Holiday,” Daniels said. “I think she kicked off the civil rights movement as we know it to be with the song ‘Strange Fruit.’ … And two, because I’ve been struggling with my own addictions, and as an artist, I understood Billie. As a Black person in this field that we do, I got it, and I felt that I had to do her justice.”
Justice is what Holiday fought for, although  it may be surprising  for some to find out that the U.S. government targeted her because of that. Day was not shocked to learn about the extent the U.S. government was willing to go to silence Holiday, but she was shocked by Holiday’s character. 
“When you’re aware of things like COINTELPRO and you’re aware of the Tuskegee experiments, it’s not shocking,” Day said. “What shocked me was her, and what shocked me was her resilience and her fight.” 
Day went on to explain that Holiday endured trauma, addiction and government persecution during a time where the civil rights movement did not exist, so she was alone in her plight. The fact that Holiday somehow found the strength to endure all of these difficulties on her own shocked Day. 
While Daniels could relate to Holiday because of their shared experience as Black artists and their  struggles with addiction, Day related to Holiday in a different way. Day could relate to Holiday on more levels because she shares an additional experience with Holiday: being a Black woman in the United States. 
“For me it wasn’t necessarily about [showing] up and [being] prepared just for this scene, it was like just [being] her,” Day said. “And not just be her, but be a very, very vulnerable, a very fractured you, in being her. When people talk about the parallels, I’m still a Black woman, and I’m a Black woman living in America so I know that loneliness, and I know that invisibility.”
Embodying the role of Holiday required much more than vulnerability for Day. It also required a lot of hard work. On top of doing extensive research through books, documentaries and internet searches, Day also used method acting techniques to better play her role. 
“I started smoking cigarettes and I don’t smoke, and drinking alcohol and I don’t drink, and cussing and I don’t cuss,” Day said. “You know everything that was necessary because she’s worth it.” 
Day had to be vulnerable and abandon her selfhood in order to become Holiday. She had to sing, dance and talk like Holiday which took a toll on her own identity. 
“The hardest thing for me, to date, it was leaving the character,” Day said. “It’s been three years, so I don’t really know who I am in this season of my life outside of Billie.” 
In order to get this level of involvement from his crew, Daniels always works to foster a friendly and collaborative environment on his sets. 
“He creates what he always says a ‘cookout’ barbecue feel on set,” Day said. “Everybody wanted everybody to win and that’s I think what netted us such a beautiful end result.” 
Daniels established that sort of environment by treating everyone on set as equals. He made sure that the background actors knew that they are just as important to him as Holiday. 
In a way, Daniel’s effort to make his set inclusive and equal reflects the struggle that Holiday undertook in the 1940s when segregation divided people upon racial lines. This film is about the story of Holiday, but it carries with it the spirit of her as well.Day did not play a role, she became the role, and Daniels did not simply film a movie, he respected and promoted the values that Holiday fought for by ensuring  everyone on set felt like equals. 
The film will premiere exclusively on Hulu Feb. 26.

For those who have lost faith in the system, new developments in Biden-era policy act as a stepping stone in rebuilding immigrant and foreign trust in American higher education. The situational nightmare faced by international students and DACA recipients alike may have been reformed by executive order, but the trauma and duress placed on the shoulders of students in the United States has not been forgotten. 
It is evident by the 13% nationwide decreases in enrollment that there are obstacles deterring our learners. In light of the new world order, students across the nation are demanding policymakers in higher education come to the table with terms that are realistic for a pandemic-afflicted student body — none so strongly as those who have been burdened the most. 
It is clear that the pandemic is not only one of health-related concerns but one of unparalleled financial stressors and a rising nationalistic sentiment that has left many non-citizens in a threatening limbo. 
The 2020 spring semester was a period of lethargy, adjustment and general acceptance of a humdrum fate for most; for others, the weaknesses of foreign and domestic policy in the United States culminated in a perfect storm of legal issues, leaving visas in question and DACA protections at risk. 
While we have all endured an unthinkable year, the collateral damage of the past year — the past administration — has made President Joe Biden’s efforts a starting point for rehabilitating trust in our institutions and creating a foundation to come back to campus better than where we left in March 2020. 
In the wake of last spring’s visa restrictions, the outpouring of backing for international students on behalf of the University was indicative of healthy systems of protection and support. The early arising legal issues of visas stipulating that international students attend in-person class quickly became a relic of a pre-pandemic system but remained a very real threat to the University’s students along with the international student population nationwide. 
The lawsuit filed by USC, in coalition with a number of other universities, offered more safeguarding care than the governing administration. The displacement of these students is still ongoing as we slowly begin to see some international students returning to campuses in the United States while others have returned home for the foreseeable future. 
For marginalized students and DACA recipients, this time has been no less taxing. The Trump administration was quick to pull at the strings of former president Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, jeopardizing the futures of many who have known no other nation than this one. 
It was on the hearts of many, mine included, when the administration chose none other than a period of pandemic to push through with the stripping away of protections for young adults with hopes no different than mine. 
Reports estimate that undocumented students constitute 2% of the nation’s postsecondary enrollees. Along with these individuals, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs estimated the nation to have hosted over one million international students for the school year beginning in 2019. 
These students, along with all individuals enrolled in higher education, are vital to the economy, culture and progression of the nation and this University. It is undoubtedly true that countless breakthroughs in all fields have been made possible by the talent and ingenuity of students from marginalized communities and international backgrounds. 
While DACA was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court and fortified by Biden in the last week, there is still room to grow. Immigration policy regarding deportations, detention camps and abuses in border patrol authority are still prevalent in our community and continue to affect immigrant families. In the way of visas, we are still patiently awaiting word of how we are to move forward with travel bans, welcoming back international students and tackling the backlog of visa applications.
All in all, the support of these demographics needs to be equivalent to the effort and contributions they have made to the world around them. The increasingly impractical cost of higher education in the U.S. along with increasingly unaccommodating practices toward students of diverse backgrounds has all but led to the conclusion that education is only for students who can check all the right boxes. 
In a pandemic-stricken world, we are all looking for investments and practices that fit within our new means. As far as students are concerned, we are looking for institutions that will protect our interests, encourage our aspirations and accommodate our new way of living. 
As a university and as friends of those affected by these domestic policies, the rolling out of Biden’s immigration policy is of the utmost concern for the livelihoods of our family and colleagues. We are looking to our institutions and leaders, asking for a new dialogue that is inclusive of, protective of and compassionate towards its students. 
We are all rebuilding confidence in the systems that have been bent or have always been broken, and as students, we are seeking to do what we have always been taught: Learn a new way.

The Los Angeles Lakers fans feel robbed. Yes, their favorite team survived a dogfight against a hard-nosed, talented Miami Heat squad in the NBA Finals last season. But Laker fans were forced to look on from their couches, cheering at their screen as teammates LeBron James and Anthony Davis lifted the Larry O’ Brien trophy in October. No celebration, no high-fiving other random Laker fans, no championship parade through the streets of Staples Center. While the trophy marks the 17th championship in Lakers franchise history, tying it with the Boston Celtics for the most in NBA history, it was far from the normal victory experience.
Now, the Lakers are back with a vengeance, sitting at a 16-6 record so far this season, continuing to look like one of the most dominant teams in the league. 
So often, we hear the term “championship hangover,” as victorious teams just wrapping up an offseason filled with parades and trips to Vegas come out of the gates in the new season looking sluggish and disinterested. It’s hard to blame them; these teams often know what they are capable of, looking to simply bide time until the playoffs come around. However, of the Lakers rotation players, only a few have witnessed a true championship parade. 
Guys like Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Markieff Morris and Kyle Kuzma all secured the ring on their fingers, but they are likely still eager for the real championship experience — one with thousands of fans packed into the streets, cheering their names, making the feat feel even more impressive. This quest to bring a parade to the city of L.A. has provided the champs with some added motivation to keep them engaged during the regular season, hence the impressive record, good for just half a game back from the first seed in the Western Conference. 
General manager Rob Pelinka strengthened the team in the offseason, adding workhorses like Dennis Schroeder, Montrezl Harrell and Wesley Matthews — all high energy contributors. Both Schroeder and Matthews can dig in defensively, while Harrell gives the Lakers the extra boost of offense that they weren’t getting from Dwight Howard or JaVale McGee last season. These high-motor players have been able to keep the energy up on the court to avoid the dangerous “championship hangover.”
The new additions have also given head coach Frank Vogel a variety of strong lineups to play with. After winning his first championship in October, Vogel had a shortened two month offseason to figure out how he’d like to work his rotations. With the emergence of second-year guard Talen Horton-Tucker as a legitimate rotation piece, Vogel admitted to Lakers media personnel the bittersweet issue in his locker room. 
“It’s a good problem, but it makes my job harder trying to make sure we have appropriate minutes for the abilities of the players that we have and there’s a lot of nights we don’t have appropriate minutes for everyone,” Vogel said in an interview with reporters.
Come playoff time, the abundance of depth on this Lakers team will shine, but for now, it has become an issue. Vogel simply can’t find time for the Lakers’ secret weapon: Alex Caruso. If you caught any of the teams’ playoff games last season, you know what Caruso can bring to the table. Vogel chose Caruso to replace Dwight Howard in the Lakers’ starting lineup in the closeout game of last year’s Finals. Somehow, in a shortened offseason, the 26-year old has become more impactful than he was last season. 
Caruso’s stats this season aren’t mind-boggling — he’s putting up 5.6 points per game, 2.3 rebounds per game, and 2.1 assists per game. Yes, that’s it. But Caruso is the epitome of a winning player. If you look at his box score nightly you won’t be impressed, but he makes winning plays. Take the Lakers’ most recent win against the Hawks on Feb. 1, where he grabbed an offensive rebound to seal the win as an example of his timely contributions. 
Despite Caruso’s open shot-making ability and defensive sharpness, Vogel has only given him 18.3 minutes per game. In the playoffs, this number simply has to increase. Maybe Vogel wants to conserve Caruso and keep him healthy for the playoffs, but the bottom line is, when the game is on the line, the “Bald Mamba” has to be on the court.
