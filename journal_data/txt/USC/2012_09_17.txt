The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Friday, Sept. 14, and Monday, Sept. 17. 
Crimes against property
at 4:54 p.m. on Sept. 16, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect trespassing at Regional Trojan Arms and detained him for investigation. The officers found the suspect in possession of a bicycle that was registered to a student, but they were unable to contact him to determine if a crime had occurred.  The officers then impounded the bike and the suspect was released after being advised against trespassing on university property.
at 5:00 p.m. on Sept. 15, a suspect pried open security bars, pulled off a screen and climbed through a window to gain entry at a residence on Portland Street.  The suspect then removed a laptop computer, a camera, a cellular phone and a wallet.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 4:10 a.m. on Sept. 16, DPS officers responded to a student who drove his vehicle into a tree in a median near the intersection of 23rd and Figueroa streets. The student sustained abrasions to his arm and shoulder but declined medical treatment and was released at the scene.
at 11:58 a.m. on Sept. 15, DPS officers responded to a student who struck her head on a wrought iron gate when she fell while climbing over it at Elizabeth Von KleinSmid Memorial Residence Hall. The officers examined the student then transported her to Good Samaritan Hospital for medical treatment.
at 9:50 P.m. on Sept. 15, DPS officers responded to a report of a water leak at Cecele and Michael Birnkrant Residence Hall. Upon their arrival, a student directed them to the lobby, where water was dripping from an exposed pipe in the ceiling.  The officers positioned a trash can beneath the pipe to catch the water, then FMS personnel were requested to clean up and conduct repairs.
@George – Crimes against property include two groups—crimes in which property is destroyed and crimes in which property is stolen or taken against the owner’s will.
The remainder of your response warrants no reply.  Now sober up and get some sleep before posting.
Love mom.
Hahahahaha…
What exactly is a “Crime Against Property”?   
The last one makes no sense to me.   How did the pipe get stuck on the ceiling?  How much bong water could there be to need a trash can to collect the dripping water?

A recent spate of earthquakes has raised some concerns among students about the university’s preparedness as well as if a bigger quake might be on its way. Even with experts predicting a big earthquake to hit Southern California soon, the university is prepared, according to Steve Goldfarb, USC’s fire safety and emergency planning specialist.
Earlier this month, a tremor was felt across Los Angeles County after an earthquake rattled Beverly Hills at 12:03 a.m. The relatively minor magnitude-3.5 earthquake was the area’s second of that week, following one of magnitude 3.2 at the start of the week.
In accordance with USC protocol, the Dept. of Public Safety was quick to survey the campus and immediately identify any damage and injuries, Goldfarb said. Goldfarb said DPS reported no injuries or damages as a result of the earthquakes.
Some students, like Sara Worth, a sophomore majoring in political sciences, said they were  not fazed by the earthquakes.
“I was sitting at my desk when I felt a small tremor. I wasn’t entirely sure if it was even an earthquake,” Worth said.
Though some students said they did not feel the earthquakes, others, like Rachel Weber, a sophomore majoring in theater, said the quake was worrying.
“Being originally from the East Coast, even small earthquakes do seem pretty scary,” Weber said. “It’s important that every student know how to best deal with emergencies.”
Earthquakes are commonplace in Southern California since the region lies upon the San Andreas Fault, which separates the area from the rest of the continental United States. The last major rupture on the San Andreas dealt a devastating blow to the city of San Francisco in 1906. For decades, experts have anticipated a volatile earthquake hitting California, which many have dubbed the “big one.”
Though some experts said the Beverly Hills tremors are not predictive of the “big one,” they said an earthquake is likely to rattle the state soon.
“California is very overdue for a Southern San Andreas earthquake,” said Mark Benthien, director for communication, education and outreach at the Southern California Earthquake Center, based at USC. “If you consider that earthquakes in the past happen every 150-200 years, and it’s been now over 320 years since the last big earthquake … scientists are concerned.”
Worth said that in light of recent tremors, it would be worthwhile for the university to promote its safety protocol.
“It would be helpful for [USC] to provide information on how to stay safe during emergencies, especially with the prediction of a large earthquake,” Worth said.
Goldfarb said USC has an award-winning Emergency Response Plan, which includes a comprehensive system of steps to follow in the event of a large quake. In the case of an earthquake, Goldfarb suggests that students find cover under a table or desk or drop and cover by an interior wall.
“Don’t run,” Goldfarb said. “Most injuries occur from falling debris, so take cover wherever you are.”
Benthien said Los Angeles is one of the most prepared areas in the world for earthquakes. Still, he said he believes there can always be room for improvement.
“There are always aspects that we are not prepared for, because we can’t have every building perfectly earthquake resistant, and we don’t have the resources to respond instantly to every situation involving injuries,” Benthien said. “We can always do more to be better prepared.”
SCampus, USC’s student handbook, recommends that all students familiarize themselves with the emergency procedures of their residences and prepare an emergency kit. Guidelines as to what an emergency kit should contain can be accessed at the SCampus website. Additionally, at the start of the school year, the university posted a video on YouTube outlining its emergency procedures.
Goldfarb also said USC’s annual involvement with the Great California Shakeout is an important part of its preparations. This year’s shakeout, which simulates a 7.8 magnitude earthquake, will be held on Oct. 18 at 10:18 a.m. Students, staff and faculty will be asked to “drop, cover and hold” to simulate the tremor. USC has participated in the drill every October since the Shakeout began in 2008, Goldfarb said.
Students can register to participate in the drill on the Great California Shakeout’s website.

The USC Center for the Study of Immigration Integration recently released a study rating the lives and progress of immigrants in different regions of California. Los Angeles County, home to nearly 3.5 million immigrants, scored eighth out of 10 regions in California in terms of integration for foreigners.
Santa Clara, East Bay, San Diego, Sacramento, Orange, San Francisco, Inland Empire, Los Angeles, San Joaquin and Fresno were all judged on their immigration integration. The study rated areas on the basis of four categories: economic status of immigrants, economic trajectory, warmth of welcome by the city itself and civic engagement. These categories were measured by analyzing annual income, home ownership, language gaps, cost of living and various other factors.
The study identified several areas of improvement that Los Angeles, such as its immigrant English-speaking ability, the education system and housing, according to the study.
Hugo Charcon, a culinary specialist who immigrated from Guatemala 25 years ago and now works at EVK Restaurant and Grill, said he understands why Los Angeles did not score higher.
“There’s not too much opportunity to study in this country. But, if you educate [yourself], you get a better job; no matter what, you can get a physical job, but if you get an education, you get a better rate than people without a diploma,” Charcon said. “I think for me this a main concern. If people don’t have education, they can’t integrate. There may be people that stay here 10 years that still don’t speak English.”
Sydney Ross, an L.A. native and a freshman majoring in critical studies, said she sees immigrants as an integral part of L.A. society.
“Most of the immigrants in the area aren’t too well-off, but they’re very family-oriented and hard-working,” Ross said. “They’re here to make a better life for themselves than the one they were destined to live back at home. They’re very much a part of the society here.”
USC itself has a similar composition as Los Angeles — about 12 percent of the undergraduate student body is international, according to the university.
Some students, such as sophomore engineering major Akshay Aggarwal, said Parkside International Residential College’s mix of international and local students and the several international clubs on campus demonstrate the university’s effort toward inclusion of immigrants.
“Specifically at USC, the immigrant population is treated as a part of the community and, besides for the increased tuition they are asked to pay, they do not face any other blatant prejudices or disadvantages,” Aggarwal said.
International student Anisha Veer, a junior business major from Hyderabad, India, however, did not agree.
“Older immigrants like grad students tend to stick more to their culture and don’t adapt or assimilate into American life as easily as younger immigrants or people who have been exposed to multiple cultures and have traveled extensively,” Veer said.

The USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy opens next Monday with a ceremony that will include the former governor, Sen. John McCain and former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, among other politicians, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The institute will be housed in the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy and will focus on transcending partisanship in state, social and economic policies throughout the nation and the world.
Many students believe that the institute will add an intriguing element to USC and its academics.
“It is a really cool and great idea on the school’s part to have major representation at [an] institute based on politics,” freshman neuroscience major Melissa Bonner said.
Schwarzenegger will also serve as a professor at USC. He believes that students can learn from Hollywood and apply those lessons to the world of politics.
The former governor donated $20 million from his personal funds to create the institute. The expense of this project, however, leads some students to believe that Schwarzenegger has ulterior motives for starting the institute.
“If he just gave money for school then it’s OK, but I’m kind of questioning his motives for it,” said Mike Kordbacheh, a  graduate student studying  international public policy and management. “There’s a bit be more to it and politics might definitely be behind it.”
There is also concern that the former governor and his classes will have no academic value in an institute dedicated to politics.
“Politics has nothing to do with Hollywood,” Kordbacheh said.
“There’s not much politics can learn from Hollywood.”
Still, many students expressed curiosity to see the impact the institute will have on USC in the long run.
“The institute is beneficial because global policy is important also,” Jordan Caldwell, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said. “We have a school for public policy, so I guess this will be an interesting addition.”

The USC Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics hosted a panel Monday on contemporary constitutional issues in celebration of the 225th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. constitution.
Analysis · Law student Breck Kadaba (left), Journal of Law and Society editor Alex Fullman, Professor Rebecca Brown and moderator Lee Epstein tackled issues from Prop. 8 to Super PACs. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
 
Members of the panel included Professor Rebecca Brown of the USC Gould School of Law, Breck Kadaba, a J.D. candidate at the USC Gould School of Law and Alex Fullman, editor in chief of the USC Journal of Law and Society. Lee Epstein, provost professor of law and political science and Rader Family trustee chair in law, served as a moderator for the discussion.
Some of the issues covered during the event included the recent health care law, super PACs and the issue of blind donations, content-based restrictions and the effect of freedom of speech on law and Prop. 8 in California, all in the context of where they stand constitutionally.
The constantly debated health care law was the first issue covered. Brown covered the issue by defining Congress’ powers, which most importantly in this instance include the regulation of commerce and taxes.
In her argument, Brown scrutinized the health care law from the perspective of the Constitution.
“The theory objecting to this was that when you make a person buy [health care], the status of that person before the law that takes effect is not commercial at all,” Brown said.
The next topic covered was money in politics, specifically focusing on super PACs and the recent Citizens United decision.
Fullman said that the Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizens United case, which gave corporations the right to spend independent money wherever they please without disclosure, could be harmful to elections.
“There’s a real need for disclosure. There’s a lot of dark money and that is the real threat to the integrity to our electoral system,” Fullman said.
Next, law student Breck Kadaba addressed the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the right to free speech.
Kadaba stressed the United States’ puritanical roots and its devotion, as both a country and a government, to the words and policies of the Constitution as the reason for many of these policies, especially the Supreme Court’s unwillingness to create a strict definition for free speech.
“The court doesn’t want to be the person to come down and say, ‘Well, here’s the line,’” Kadaba said.
The panelists finished the discussion with the topic of the Prop. 8 case and the constitutionality of gay marriage. Though the case has been kicked up to the Supreme Court, the justices have not yet revealed whether or not they will take the case.
The main issue in the case, according to Brown, is whether prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying could be ruled as discrimination.
“Every person in this country is entitled not to be grouped and treated more burdensomely than anyone else without a rational reason,” Brown said.

Among the chatter of a lively crowd, heels click and glasses clink. A well-dressed man stands in front of a piece, analyzing it with wine in hand. A gallery worker moves past him holding a clipboard and takes a small red dot sticker, placing it on a work. That artwork now belongs to one of the collectors in the room. With success, more red dots will soon fill the gallery’s walls.
All about art · Freeberg’s colorful photograph “Andrea Rosen” shows an art gallery employee completely absorbed in her work. – Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
 
Outside, visitors smoke cigarettes and curious passers-by debate whether to walk in or not. At any given opening, someone, young or old, discovers an artist for the first time, while an art critic takes notes for a review. As a crowd, the visitors and workers take the two or so hours of the opening and transform the gallery space from a quiet atmosphere into a buzzing one.
This is the typical art gallery opening scene. Though some galleries give the standard opening a twist with DJs, giveaways and more, the standard opening night proves an important social event and an even more significant event for the gallery and its sales.
But the glamorous scene does not unfold as easily as it seems. Before visitors show up, there are bags of ice and boxes of wine to buy, lights to check, artwork to hang and press releases to print. There is conversation with longtime patrons, press outlets and the artist him/herself.
For Andy Freeberg, something about the behind-the-scenes of the art world beckoned. Freeberg began taking photos of art fairs — where multiple galleries showcase art in one spot — back in 2009 and created a series called “Sentry,” which simply featured desks belonging to galleries throughout Chelsea, N.Y. and the tops of heads. Impressively, Freeberg managed to take the most unassuming  part of the galleries and create a compositionally interesting series of photos.
The photographer is currently showing newer photos at Kopeikin Gallery in Culver City, Calif. in his show “Art Fare.” The scenes in these collections focus on more intriguing backgrounds; the figures go about their normal duties with eye-catching artworks or intriguing colors or objects in the background. Even if the photo doesn’t focus on the subject’s face, each one brings a sense of personality for the figure and the gallery space he or she works in.
The photo “Andrea Rosen,” which shows the interior of the Andrea Rosen gallery in New York, especially captures personality, adding vitality to an otherwise common scene. Here, the female subject idly checks her phone as she sits on a black couch with her laptop and office supplies on the table in front of her. She sits to one side of the photograph, the rest of the space taken up mostly by the brightly colored piece of art on the wall. The work blends bright red with yellow in an eye-catching manner, the movement of the work contrasting the frozen moment in which the woman looks at her phone.
The photograph stands out because it does what a good photograph should — it finds just the right moment and angle to transform a scene. If the same viewer seeing this photograph were to walk by the female subject inside the actual New York gallery, they most likely would not look twice. But Freeberg’s decision to photograph her at that particular moment resulted in a visually intriguing piece.
In the art world today, it proves difficult to think of a new and interesting idea. Yet Freeberg’s photo utilizes the idea of innovation passed down through generations of photographers: The photographer can take his lens and use it to frame the world in an unusual manner. “Andrea Rosen” demonstrates Freeberg’s ability to frame the subject and her surroundings as part of something as exciting and important as a gallery opening.
In the photo, the female subject checks her phone with one hand while keeping the other still on her laptop, a small detail that suggests the busy life of those involved with running a gallery. Whether intentional or not, the color of her shirt almost nearly matches that of the artwork’s background, suggesting some sort of connection between the gallery figure and the art that hangs. At the end of the day, the art that visitors see reflects meticulous attention to detail and is the result of months, if not more, of advanced planning.
Even if visitors to Kopeikin Gallery do not know the story behind the photograph, the transformation of an ordinary scene into a visually intriguing work proves itself undeniable. “Andrea Rosen” serves as a reminder that the best photographs are sometimes taken from simple scenes.
“Art Fare” runs until Oct. 27. Kopeikin Gallery is located at 2766 S. La Cienega Blvd. in Culver City.

There are few cinematic events more noteworthy than the release of a Paul Thomas Anderson film. Though the director only had five features under his belt before the release of his latest work, each one, to a varying extent, is regarded as a masterpiece. With the release of The Master (a title that Anderson is no doubt used to bearing himself), it’s no wonder that audience expectations of the director’s new work are high.
Religious allegory? · The Master’s subject matter has drawn criticism for its similarities to the founding of the Church of Scientology. – | Photo courtesy of The Weinstein Company
Luckily, there’s little need to curb the hype. Once again, Anderson rises to the occasion.
The film opens with Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell, a sex-obsessed and hot-headed veteran of World War II’s Pacific theater. V-J Day triggers Quell’s aimless cavorting through a number of low wage jobs until he drunkenly stumbles onto a yacht filled with the family and closest friends of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the leader of a new religious movement known as The Cause. Dodd takes a liking to Quell, who soon becomes Dodd’s right-hand man as Dodd leads his congregation and tries to spread his message to the world.
Like There Will Be Blood before it, The Master is very much a character piece, focusing on the relationship between its two leads. In that respect, it’s entirely successful. Phoenix and Hoffman are world class performers at the top of their games, playing off each other beautifully in every minute they share onscreen. An early scene in which Dodd subjects Quell to an intense Q&A session as a form of psychological processing could win either man an Oscar. And though the two characters couldn’t be more different, they form a deep and believable bond with each other.
That being said, however, it still remains to be seen whether the front-and-center placement of the characters do anything to alleviate the already overwhelming comparisons between Anderson’s film and real-life issues.
Much has been made of the degree to which the film is an allegory to Scientology. But though the parallels are inescapable, the story functions perfectly well when viewed independently of founder L. Ron Hubbard’s movement. It could be argued that The Master does not mean to call into question any particular New Age belief system. Instead, the film takes a skeptical attitude towards anyone who creates something approximating a religion of which they themselves are the focus.
Never is this more apparent than when a New York gathering is interrupted by a skeptic who doesn’t buy into The Cause’s claims. Dodd attempts a rational defense, but simple and persistent nonbelief soon causes him to snap and expose that he and Quell are both just as easily provoked: The former emotionlessly beats victims while the latter flies into a passionate verbal rage when his righteousness is challenged. It’s one of several momentary lapses that demystify the leader as just a flawed individual who happens to be very good at getting people to listen to him.
If anything, Dodd receives a largely sympathetic portrayal; he’s not a willful manipulator so much as a man who has started to believe his own hype after years of interacting with devoted followers. The most prominent member of the flock is Dodd’s wife, played by a severe Amy Adams, who has no time for anyone not entirely committed to extending her husband’s influence. She’s the worst kind of believer — the type who thinks a crusade is actually helpful.
But this film isn’t particularly interested in exploring a cult’s effect on its members. Quell himself never really subscribes to The Cause’s doctrines, although he still tries to expand his mind in a thrilling, entirely cerebral take on  a “training” montage.
Yet despite his failure to fully engage with the movement itself, Quell remains Dodd’s fiercest, most loyal defender, quick to assault anyone who expresses any doubt over The Cause’s legitimacy while harboring no deep-seated faith of his own. For all the acclaim Dodd has won through his writing and charisma, it’s Quell’s simple dependency on him that engenders the greatest dedication.
That seems to be what Dodd might need the most — someone who likes him without necessarily believing every word he says. That very element of doubt makes it the most honest relationship in the film — a friendship that can be cringe-inducing one minute and surprisingly hilarious the next. Throughout The Master, the relationship remains fully plausible. This is a film that feels like it never could have been made any other way.
The same can’t be said about The Cause’s beliefs. A few sequences suggest Dodd might be making up the whole religion as he goes along, that he’s floundering aimlessly and that all who subscribe to his teachings are fools. This is a film that questions many faiths.
Rest assured, though, that it reaffirms this: Paul Thomas Anderson still knows exactly what he’s doing.

An L.A. audience has never been as excited to hear a doorbell as in the opening moments of The Book of Mormon at the Pantages Theater. As the show draws palpable energy from crowds lucky enough to get tickets to an early show, its run until Nov. 25 looks promising.

At its heart, The Book of Mormon is a coming-of-age tale centered around two mismatched companions and their journey to accept each other. What makes Mormon different from other shows, though, is that the companions are Mormon missionaries, and the play is mostly an in-your-face discussion of faith and whether or not it makes any sense.
Once the idea of a controversial musical fades, however, the audience is left with a truly spectacular show that deserves all the hype and craze that has been following it on its first national tour.
Gavin Creel as the seemingly perfect missionary Elder Price is a huge draw for the show because of his extensive history of playing big name roles such as Claude in Hair and Bert in Mary Poppins. Creel doesn’t disappoint in his latest show. In “I Believe,” his chops as a musical theater actor shine through, and his persona makes the character of Elder Price funny, over-the-top obnoxious and then relatable, all within a 2 1/2 hour show.
Price’s companion is the dim-witted but lovable Elder Cunningham, played by Jared Gertner, who is fresh off the Broadway show. During “Man Up,” Elder Cunningham sings “time to stand up and steal the show,” and Gertner certainly does. His energy and comedic timing earn applause and laughter throughout the performance.
Together, elders Price and Cunningham are sent to Uganda to convert Africans to Mormonism. There, they quickly learn that the tactics taught at “mission control center” aren’t what villagers need to combat AIDS, warlords and famine, leading them to question if their faith is the answer for the villagers — or for themselves.
While the two leads are spectacularly cast and perform with admirable vigor, Samantha Marie Ware’s performance as villager Nabulungi (or Neutrogena or Neosporin, depending on how Elder Cunningham is trying to pronounce her name) is a true gem of Mormon. Her “Sal Tlay Ka Siti” performance has sincerely funny moments, but unlike other songs that get big laughs and knee slaps, the audience is virtually silenced by the power of her voice, not wanting to interrupt or taint a moment so beautiful until her final note.
One of the most exciting aspects of the show is that it constantly keeps you guessing. “Turn It Off” starts out as a fairly standard number, and suddenly, with clever lighting design distractions, the cast is in pink sequined vests and performing an elaborate tap dance. Thematic surprises also filter into numbers, like in “Spooky Mormon Hell Dream” when Elder Price is haunted by dancing Starbucks cups, and Johnnie Cochran. This sequence also features the show’s most elaborate choreography with actors in skeleton costumes performing with top hats and canes.
The intricate choreography shifts also play into the incredibly smart set changes, as during “You and Me (But Mostly Me).” In this scene, Elder Price sends Elder Cunningham off the stage as the set literally collapses around him, leaving Elder Price alone on the stage to shine in his own spotlight and belt out the final notes of the song.
The show and its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker (South Park) and Robert Lopez (Avenue Q), have dealt with a lot of criticism about the show’s content — the show  has even been called blasphemous — but those critics are completely missing the point of the show.
Still, with Mormon’s coarse material, it’s easy to see why. Easily the most blatantly “offensive” song is “Hasa Diga Eebowai” as elders Price and Cunningham learn that this village’s version of “Hakuna Matata” isn’t exactly PG, but gives an opportunity to vent their frustrations by “rais[ing] your middle finger … and curs[ing] His rotten name.”
Nevertheless, despite the scene’s “explicit” content, the thesis of the show appears in full force.
In what Parker and Stone have called “a love letter to religion,” this show suggests that religion isn’t stupid, but can be used as a coping mechanism and a tool to explain the world. In the end, if that’s what you need to get through the day and be a good person, then what’s the big deal? Who cares if it makes sense or not?
To see for yourself, check out the show, but if you can’t get tickets to the nearly sold out shows, “just throw [your] hands to the sky and say, ‘Hasa Diga Eebowai’.”

Monday marked the one-year anniversary of the Occupy movement.
Last year’s “U.S. Day of Rage” kicked off protests against corporatism and corruption  — two major societal ills that persist today. Inspired by pro-democracy protests in the Middle East and North Africa, more than 1 million people across the United States and dozens of other countries have participated to date. The movement was massive, direct democracy action that has not been seen in the United States in years.
But as it currently exists, the Occupy movement has failed.
When the protests began last year, they attracted a large, diverse group of people — college students, blue collar workers, ex-Wall Street employees and people from varying age groups and educational backgrounds. The idea was simple: People come together to focus on the issues that go beyond basic partisan divides — namely financial corruption. Protesters were angry at government bailouts for banks, rising student debt, the Citizens United ruling (the landmark Supreme Court case that allows corporations and unions to spend freely on political campaigns) and a stimulus bill that didn’t go far enough.
Occupations were met with mass arrests, violent evictions and media blackouts. Aside from this suppression, winter’s arrival meant many protesters leaving the outdoor camps. The combination of these factors left more moderate voices outside Occupy and allowed the much more radical anarchist and socialist views to dominate the movement.
Occupy lost momentum because the protesters could not alter their strategy.
Instead of keeping its focus on the big picture, Occupy slid into narrow issues, such as protesting local police actions. And instead of being inclusive, the different occupations seemed wary of attracting new supporters.
Yet, a year later, Occupy’s message remains true. In fact, everything the movement stands for is even more important now than it was in 2011.
Income disparity continues to plague not only the United States, but the entire world. This summer’s news that banks across the world manipulated the London Interbank Offered Rate — also known as LIBOR, the rate banks are charged for borrowing from each other — shows that corruption in the financial world continues. Conservative candidates call for cutting the budget and lowering taxes — a foolish talking point considering the United States has one of the lowest tax rates in the world. Bank bailouts helped keep the economy from free falling, but executives behind risky and corrupt policies remain unpunished.
In other words, the Occupy movement failed to change the systems it criticized. But there is a way, right now, for Occupy to have a more significant impact: voting.
As more radical groups gained prominence inside Occupy, there were calls to disassociate from the current political environment and create something new. The chances of replacing the current government in the United States and the value of doing so are astronomically low. But reforming and altering the system? That’s possible, and it is accomplished through participating in that very system.
Occupy did manage to change some of the conversations in American politics. Wealth inequality and student debt are being discussed in the presidential campaign and in Congress. President Barack Obama is a big supporter of the so-called “Buffett rule,” a tax on wealthier Americans that would fund government programs to help those who are less fortunate. And Obama recently said he wants a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United ruling.
Occupy has the power to direct political discourse and raise issues to the public. So why isn’t it? It’s a major election year and many people say they will not vote. Occupiers, instead of staying in encampments, should be spreading out and going door to door, encouraging people to participate in November to bring to light some of the problems facing the country. This year’s Occupy movement should be “Occupy the electoral system.”
The Occupy movement has a chance to challenge powerful interests in the country, but it is at a crossroads. It can maintain its current strategy of criticizing narrowly without looking at the big picture, or it can reach out, be more proactive and take advantage of election season to win back some of the diverse support it had when it started.
 
Nicholas Slayton is a senior majoring in print and digital journalism.
The Occupy movement is a failure because it is based on a  false premise that 99% of the people are against 1%.  Anyone working at USC who participates in their 403B has a vested interest in the success of “Wall Street” as will many of our bright students who go on to hold professional roles throughout this great land.
In addition – the leadership and representation of this so-called movement is, well…. best described by the actions of its own people:
…Still, Rogers said he thinks the anniversary has been a success.
 “This is only year one,” he said. “We’re like a baby.”
 Just then, Rogers’ friend handed him a marijuana cigarette, and two police officers quickly descended.
 “Put it out, now!” a police officer shouted.
 “It’s out,” Rogers replied.

Many students today seem quick to deride traditional standardized examination formats as excuses for poor academic performances.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
 
Advocates of eliminating standardized testing point to students inappropriately prioritizing their grades over attaining a balanced education, sometimes choosing to cheat in some form, either during in-class exams or — as we saw last week at Harvard University — by plagiarizing. As a result, universities across America are facing mounting pressures to “level the testing playing field” by finding methods to test students’ knowledge in more “fair” ways and by providing project extensions and longer testing times on an individual basis.
But the stresses of perhaps unfair universal standards model real-life circumstances, and universities shouldn’t enact poor policies in the hopes of protecting students from the challenges of objective assessments.
If we, as students, should take anything away from this recent economic downturn and its subsequent job-market difficulties, it is that learning only for the sake of learning isn’t a practical way to view higher education. It’s naive for students to spend their college careers under the assumption that the real world acts fairly and judges everyone individually, and it would be irresponsible for universities to promote this mindset.
It goes without saying that adhering solely to a test-centered mentality hardly fosters a healthy attitude toward ongoing education. Nevertheless, leveling the testing playing field to each student’s estimated ability is a blatant departure from the realities of the modern world of employment, which often pressures workers in standardized-test-like scenarios.
From an employer’s standpoint, standardized exams can provide the closest parallel to the expectations and standards of corporate America. Thriving companies look to recruit organized, quick-thinking students with keen analytical and reasoning abilities. In fact, many top banking and consulting firms conduct in-person interviews to seek out prospective interns and full-time hires who possess these traits.
In light of this, traditional standardized exams increasingly seem to be essential to the academic process, not only in terms of the style of testing but in that they force individuals to work within constraints and labor up to an objective standard expected of them. After all, companies don’t give extended deadlines to employees who find it difficult or stressful to concentrate — they expect the job to get done, and look for people who can execute on such demands. For university policy to ignore this does a disservice to our students by insufficiently preparing them for their futures.
There is no, nor should there ever be, a guaranteed formula for success in college. Some students can ace courses without opening textbooks while others labor arduously over class concepts every day and simply scrape by. Though this might be an unfortunate truth, it is not the university’s responsibility to ensure that students who study hard see their work pay off in the form of a high grade point average. In the end, getting the job done trumps the subjectivity of what constitutes hard work from person to person.
For better or worse, standardized tests reinforce this in our classrooms so that students can be fully prepared for the reality that lies ahead of them.

A penny saved is a penny earned. Or so goes the saying, which holds especially true for penny-pinching students trying to make it at a school as expensive as USC.
However, as demonstrated by the recent success story of Auburn University Ph.D. student Jonathan Hood, making ends meet may just mean looking harder for those little secret money caches, many of which are still available in these trying economic times. Paying off tuition, cancelling debts from loans and buying supplies at the minimal cost—these are all possible if we are willing to think outside the box and scout for money-making methods.
Hood made headlines, thanks to his phenomenal success earning cash through mail-in rebates. As Hood told Yahoo’s Business Insider, companies return rebates as prepaid debit cards, and occasionally as checks or liquid cash. Hood managed to pay off tuition for a semester—$4,500—just with prepaid debit cards. Though not all rebates are fully refunded, Hood has, according to Insider, used only “free-after-rebate” offers that do provide the full refund. Shopping online, particularly hunting for offers on sites Fatwallet.com, Newegg.com and Frys.com, was integral to his success.
Other methods abound. Survey websites, such as Surveyspot and Valuedopinions, reward in gift cards, air miles, cash and points for prizes. Students can also be compensated for participation in research studies: at USC, for example, students can join the mailing list of the Los Angeles Behavioral Economics Laboratory, which regularly conducts paid experiments. Some sites pay for watching ads, like Jingit and Neobux. Collecting cans and bottles for recycling kills two birds with one stone; earning extra change and improving the environment.
There are also more expert money-making methods, such as buying and selling items on eBay or playing smart in the stock market. Though they demand months of patience and self-training, these methods can be worth the big haul in the end.
For the extra money and a possible semester paid off with mail-in rebates, the creative challenge of saving and making the big bucks sounds like a talent worth the time

The USC Trojans were upset by the Stanford Cardinal on Saturday night, sending them down more than 10 slots in both the AP and USA Today Coaches’ polls.
Following USC’s 21-14 defeat, the Trojans fell to 13th in the AP poll and 12th in the USA Today Coaches’ poll. They are the highest ranked team with at least one loss, five spots ahead of Michigan in both polls. In total, there are five team with one loss in the AP poll and six in the USA Today Coaches’ poll.
USC’s drop led to a shakeup at the top of the rankings, as LSU moved up to no. 2 and Oregon moved up to No. 3. The Ducks are now the highest rated team in the Pac-12. Stanford improved to No. 9 in the AP poll and No. 11 in the Coaches’ poll, one spot ahead of the Trojans.
Other ranked Pac-12 teams include UCLA, No. 19 in AP and USA Today Coaches’ poll, and Arizona, No. 22 in AP poll and No. 21 in USA Today Coaches’ poll.
The Trojans will try to keep their slim championship hopes alive starting Saturday in a home game against the Cal Golden Bears. Cal fell to 1-2 on Saturday after a 35-28 loss to the No. 16 Ohio State Buckeyes, but kept the game close until the final minutes of regulation.

Live from New York, it’s a show that we can actually relate to!
Saturday Night Live’s 38th season premiered this weekend on NBC with a fancy new title sequence, a freshly plucked cast of supporting players and a bevy of hilarious and relevant sketches. While its formula is as tried and true as ever, Lorne Michaels and company are revamping their approach to allow us all to join in on the fun.
For the first time in a long time, SNL seems to be realizing that sometimes the best comedic material isn’t all that hard to find. All we really crave is ridiculous trends in popular culture and the latest political gaffes satirically reflected back at us. And with nearly four months of summer happenings to draw inspiration from, America’s favorite variety show proved on Saturday that it would stop at nothing to once again be considered must-watch TV.
From Jay Pharaoh being inaugurated as the new Barack Obama (formerly portrayed by Fred Armisen), to Jason Sudeikis and Taran Killam playing the Romney-Ryan ticket respectively, the political jabs and jokes were out in full force. All three of the men’s biting impersonations were honest and showed no signs of holding back. The show’s political parodies have proven themselves to be especially important during election years, as demonstrated in 2008 with Tina Fey’s Sarah Palin having a higher approval rating than the actual former Alaskan governor.
Host Seth MacFarlane proved to be a strong choice for the show’s fall debut. While he used cheap tricks like employing Family Guy voices during his monologue and having them converse with each other, audiences couldn’t help but eat up the expected but amusing shtick.
This tendency toward the obvious exposed itself as a theme throughout the night as the cast parodied everyone from Clint Eastwood acting crazy with a chair at the Republican National Convention, Olympian swimmer Ryan Lochte and his inability to form coherent English sentences and even K-pop sensation PSY (who made a rock-star-worthy cameo appearance) and his ridiculously catchy single “Gangnam Style.” Predictable, sure. But that’s exactly why we watch this show; we seek humorous commentary about the things we consume on a regular basis.
So a final plea to SNL: Stick around by sticking to what you know. When it comes to comedy, we are simple creatures. We don’t need pretentious concepts or obscure cultural references. Perhaps it really as easy as having Bill Hader make out with two puppets at the same time.
I thought the Ryan Lochte skit was the most amusing. My favorite quote was “If you put your ear to my ear, you can hear the ocean.” Seth MacFarlane was great through the whole show though. I look forward to seeing who else they bring to host SNL in the future. I’ve set my Hopper to record the entire season to the two terabyte DVR since I work late at Dish and am unable to watch them live. I can’t wait to catch Joseph Gordon-Levitt hosting this weekend!

USC’s pedestrian safety campaign has been doggedly trying to instill a sense of accountability in the large contingent of cyclists and boarders on campus. But and equally important component of pedestrian safety is pedestrian accountability.
Somewhere down the line, there seems to have been a subtle injection of an us vs. them mentality into the safety campaign, which is a serious obstacle to the campaign’s goal. A community where students are truly considerate of one another’s safety and space cannot develop without a sincere partnership between walkers, boarders, and cyclists alike. But several things need to happen before that partnership can be forged.
First, pedestrians need to realize that spatial awareness is not a skill reserved for people on wheels. All students have a responsibility to watch where they are going. People complain about bikers and boarders who text—and this is a problem—but what about the pedestrians who step into bike traffic or walk into other people because they’re too absorbed in their cell phones to worry about walking in a straight line? Moving slow doesn’t give you the right to just check out and assume other people will move out of your way.
Being a pedestrian also doesn’t give you the excuse to ignore the rules designed to encourage pedestrian safety. Campus police are repeatedly having to warn pedestrians not to walk in the bike lane, and it’s not uncommon to see people stop and chat in front of oncoming traffic. A pedestrian in the bike lane is no less of an offense than a biker in the pedestrian zone—both are inconsiderate and both can potentially lead to dangerous accidents.
Blaming the entire safety problem on bikes and boards leads to a general undermining of the prominent bike and boarding culture that exists on campus. USC is ideal for these kinds of transportation—if we lost that culture, it would be a real shame.
Alternatively, if this culture is encouraged—if we stop acting like pedestrian traffic is preferred and like wheels have no positive impact on our campus—then safe bike and boarding culture will be encouraged as well.
The caveat is that a bike or boarder striking a pedestrian generally inflicts more damage to the pedestrian. Also few pedestrians walk into bikers or boarders. If two pedestrians stopped in the road to talk, while ill-advised, if a car hit them the driver would not get off by arguing “it was their fault”.For community safety, it is hard to argue that walking is not preferred and the burden of care does not fall to the bikers and boarders.
