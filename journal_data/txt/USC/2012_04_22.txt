USC Swipes for the Homeless will launch its inaugural dining dollar drive Monday at three locations on campus to help raise money for the Los Angeles Mission, a non-profit organization devoted to Angelenos in need.
Students can stop by tables outside of Trojan Grounds, Café 84 and the Pertusati University Bookstore any time this week and donate their unused dining dollars. Donors must show their student ID and can give either a set amount or their remaining balances. All dining dollars and swipes will be converted by USC Hospitality into a food donation to the Los Angeles Mission.

USC Swipes for the Homeless was started after seeing how successful Swipes for the Homeless has been at other schools, including UCLA, which recently received a Campus Champions of Change Challenge award from President Barack Obama for their program.
“We’ve been trying to get started for a while but just never pushed through so it’s very exciting to see things actually get off the ground,” said Delila Pouldar, a co-founder of USC Swipes for the Homeless. “Swipes for the Homeless needed to come here.”
Tiffany Pouldar, a co-founder of USC Swipes for the Homeless, said the program is important because it benefits the community surrounding USC.
“We are surrounded by an extremely underserved community and although USC has a lot of programs dedicated to serving those around us, this can be one of the most effective because it addresses the most necessary need: the need to eat,” Pouldar said.
The program provides a convenient way for students to give back to the community during the final weeks of school, said Jamal Saleh, a co-founder of USC Swipes for the Homeless.
“It’s always been a priority, but this is really the perfect way for USC to reach out to its neighbors,” Saleh said. “It’s a very tangible and realistic way to contribute and it’s practical for students.”
USC Swipes for the Homeless is not the first organization to convert excess dining dollars to something practical. In the past, Dining Dollar Dumps were placed outside of Trojan Grounds and students were able to use excess dining dollars to purchase food items to place in the bins.
“Hopefully Swipes for the Homeless is more effective,” Saleh said. “The bins outside of [Trojan Grounds] would often get filled with trash and no one really knew where their donations were going.”
In addition to donating to the Los Angeles Mission, USC Swipes for the Homeless also wants to educate the students about homelessness in Los Angeles.
“It is such a problem in the urban city that is L.A.,” Delila Pouldar said. “For the homeless, something as basic as food is not a given.”
Phillip Royster, a sophomore majoring in architecture, said he will take part in USC Swipes for the Homeless because of its convenience.
“It’s perfect for people who can’t donate a lot of time but still want to give back,” Royster said. “I think it’s really awesome; and I’m definitely inclined to get involved.”
Michelle Hsu, a freshman majoring in business administration, said students often spend their excess dining dollars on items they do not necessarily need, but USC Swipes for the Homeless offers students another alternative.
“People just buy like a ton of water bottles to put in their car,” Hsu said. “This way, nothing goes to waste and students can reach out to people in the community who are actually in need.”
Most of the homeless around SC are simply fat.  Why give them more to eat?
Haha ^ agreed. Maybe converting the dining dollars into gym memberships would be more fitting?

USC Hospitality will renovate EVK Restaurant and Grill and Café 84 to create more inviting atmospheres and increase made-to-order food options. The renovation plan, which includes improvements in Trojan Grounds, is scheduled to be completed Aug. 1, Director of Hospitality Kris Klinger said.
Though EVK operates as one of two residential dining halls, Café 84, currently a food court, will be renovated to serve as a third dining hall next year.

“Café 84’s transition from retail to residential was in support of an initiative by Provost [Elizabeth] Garrett to create more residential pockets on campus,” Klinger said.
The renovation of Café 84 will be modeled after Whole Foods Market, Klinger said. The improvements to EVK will be modeled after True Food Kitchen, a small chain of restaurants that Klinger described as “open and bright.”
Though many students applaud the renovations, some are disappointed that Café 84, as a residential dining hall, will require students to use swipes from a meal plan.
“The only thing I don’t like is [Café 84] is going to be swipe in and swipe out, and I won’t have a meal plan next year,” said Anna Romanoff, a freshman majoring in political science. “But for the freshmen, it will be great.”
As part of the renovation, USC Hospitality will be adding a Mongolian bar be que and a pizza oven to EVK, Klinger said. In addition, USC Hospitality will add a wider variety of seating.
Some students said that though EVK is fine in its current form, upgrades are always welcome.
“I’m OK with EVK now, but there is always room for improvement,” said Sara Littrell, a freshman majoring in chemistry. “It has a reputation as the lesser of the two dining halls.”
Though Klinger said he has been told that the food in EVK has improved, he said the facility is in big need of an upgrade. Klinger said the dining hall has not undergone significant change since he was a student at USC. He graduated in 1992.
“[EVK] just needed it,” Klinger said. “We have heard from a lot of students and parents and so on that the food has gotten a lot better, but the facility is still what it is.”
In Café 84, Klinger said USC Hospitality hopes to add more stations and seating.
“The stations are somewhat similar, but they will be refaced and redone so there will be options in regard to different made-to-order types of food,” Klinger said.
In addition to the upgrades in Café 84 and EVK, Trojan Grounds, a 24-hour convenience store on the ground floor of Birnkrant Residential College, will be transformed into a licensed Starbucks, Klinger said. Additionally, USC Hospitality will make improvements to its interior.
“Outside we can’t do too much because it’s a university building,” Klinger said. “But inside it will look totally different.”
Klinger said the university would lend USC Hospitality funds for the renovation projects.
“We use internal funds, if we can, or we borrow it from the university and pay it back over time,” Klinger said.
Klinger said his department is now working with students to elicit their opinions on what food offerings they would like in the dining hall.
“Now we are working with students [to see] what they would like to see with specific foods,” he said.
Will Morrow, a freshman majoring in business administration, said EVK could improve the freshness and quality of its food.
“It sometimes gets pretty gross,” he said.
Klinger said he hopes the dining hall renovations create a more welcoming space for students.
“We want to make sure it’s a great value,” Klinger said. “So making sure the space looks great and also [that] the food is up to that standard is important. We created a really unique environment with the campus center, in particular, and we want to make sure our residential environments match that.”

Coming into this weekend’s competitions with a number of injuries, it seemed unclear if USC would be able to work through significant injuries on the men’s and women’s track and field teams.
The team started off a busy weekend at the annual Cal State Los Angeles Twilight Open. The huge outdoor meet, which consisted of more than 60 universities and clubs, took place fairly close to home at Cerritos College in Norwalk.

In addition, the team competed at three different meets from Thursday to Saturday; a heavy schedule coming off of Easter weekend break. The meets resulted in a number of individual USC victories.
The Trojans came out of the Twilight Open with a single victory, while the Women of Troy also secured a few top-five finishes. Senior James Leckie captured the sole USC victory for the track and field team, winning the men’s 1500-meter with a time of 3:59.44. The time is a new personal record for Leckie, who usually runs the 800-meter and 1500-meter.
Senior co-captain Dalilah Muhammad finished second in the women’s 100-meter high hurdles with a time of 13.55, while fellow senior Anniya Louis finished second in the women’s 800-meter with a time of 2:14.42 (a season best).
Senior Tamara Baumann placed second in the women’s hammer throw, posting a mark of 54.02 meters, followed closely by redshirt junior Ashley Pyka in third with a mark of 53.14 meters.
Though squads did compete at the CSLA Twilight Open, much of the team’s effort focused on the Mt. San Antonio College Relays. The multi-day event that took place at Hilmer Lodge Stadium in Walnut, Calif., and featured a number of Olympic development races in addition to regular intercollegiate events.
The competition represented an important acid-test for the team as the Summer Olympics inch close; a number of USC athletes will be competing for the United States as well as other countries in the upcoming Olympic Games. A few athletes, particularly star sophomore Jessica Davis, made their season debuts at the meet, and the competition was an important indicator of the team’s performance at the collegiate level midway through the season as well.
USC finished the Mt. SAC Relays with a single win and a handful of top-five placements. Freshman Davonte Stewart finished first in the men’s 200- meter dash Olympic Development race, followed closely by fellow USC sophomore Aaron Brown.
In a wildly dramatic race, senior Bryshon Nellum fought on to achieve a personal record of 45.18 in the men’s 400-meter while also setting the nationally leading collegiate time. Unfortunately in the very same race senior co-captain Joey Hughes succumbed to an existing hamstring injury and was unable to compete for the rest of the weekend.
USC will next compete at the USC-UCLA Dual Meet on April 29.

We don’t have to look far for storylines from this year when it comes to USC’s athletic program. The overwhelming sentiment on campus remains: The football dynasty is back at last.
In the aftermath of two disappointing nine-and-eight win seasons in 2009 and 2010, respectively, the departure of beloved coach Pete Carroll and sanctions levied by the NCAA, USC put a lot of bad press to rest this past season.
Expectations · Since senior quarterback Matt Barkley announced his intention to return to school, hopes for the 2012 season have risen. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
It won 10 games. It closed the year ranked No. 6 in the final Associated Press top-25 poll — its first top-10 finish since 2008. Most importantly: Its star quarterback Matt Barkley signed up for his senior season, announcing his decision to return to school in front of media and  caroling members of the Trojan Marching Band last December in Heritage Hall.
There has been a lot of good will, no doubt. That’s to be expected. Fans, particularly students, have been clamoring to see USC back atop college football’s biggest stage, and recent events suggest we’re watching its steady climb.
But in spite of what has transpired in recent months — Barkley’s announcement, a 50-point thrashing of UCLA in its season finale and upset win over Oregon — 2011 will be validated by 2012.
In other words, what we witnessed last season will be rendered largely meaningless if the Trojans can’t follow up on their performance in 2012. It’s unfortunate on some level, but with upper-echelon programs, this often becomes the case.
2011 was fun in several respects. The Trojans surprised a number of fans and pundits after initially being pegged to finish just outside the top 25 at the onset of the season. They ended up squashing a two-year skid against Oregon, in addition to toppling their rivals, UCLA and Notre Dame, by a combined 64 points. That naturally creates a fair bit of buzz and excitement around a program, which has been to just one bowl game — the Emerald Bowl — over the last three seasons.
But USC created the mantra and marketing slogan of “unfinished business,” implying some sort of grand finale come next fall. It fosters similar hopes and expectations, as well.
I posed the question last November, whether Barkley and coach Lane Kiffin would get a chance to write the final chapter to their “100 Tips For Surviving NCAA Sanctions” book. Well, they’re getting their chance now.
People nostalgically compared USC’s 2011 team to its 2002 team, and it made sense to some degree. The Trojans’ 2002 team began a string of 10-win seasons that lasted all the way until 2008. The year after its 11-2 finish in 2002, USC defeated Michigan by two touchdowns in the Rose Bowl and captured an AP national title. A year later, the team won another national title amid a 34-game winning streak. The implication of comparing the two teams was that USC’s 10-2 mark last season could similarly launch another run of decade dominance.
But naturally, you have to, well, dominate. That’s the difference.
2011 will always be seen by fans as a feel-good story. Despite no prospect of playing in a bowl, the Trojans closed the year with four consecutive wins and victories in seven of their last eight games. In short, they surpassed most everyone’s expectations. It’s a nice story.
The hope, though, has also been that it resuscitated the program in the wake of NCAA violations and launched the next era of USC football under Kiffin, Carroll’s successor.
But for a program that defines its success based on national championships and Rose Bowls — both are the only achievements tabulated on the exterior of the Coliseum press box — it needs to reach that level next fall. After all, 2011 was said to be a stepping stone, and if it truly is, USC needs to be stepping up to something higher.

With the top seed in the Pac-12 tournament on the line, USC fell for the first time in 14 months in the regular season finale against its crosstown rival.
The No. 1 Trojans (25-1, 6-1) fell to No. 5 UCLA (21-2, 7-0) 3-4 in a battle at a packed Marks Stadium between two teams undefeated in conference play. By taking the final three singles matches, the Bruins upset the Trojans and snapped their 45-match win streak that began last February.
Denied · Freshman Eric Johnson and the Trojans were unable to win their 46th straight match as UCLA came out victorious, 4-3. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
UCLA’s Adrien Puget, ranked No. 61 in singles, clinched the Bruins’ victory by denying No. 43 freshman Yannick Hanfmann’s comeback attempt in a 7-6 (5), 3-6, 6-2 win.
USC had established a 3-1 lead after doubles play and after seniors Steve Johnson and Daniel Nguyen, ranked No. 2 and No. 17, respectively, defeated their opponents in straight sets in their last matches at Marks Stadium.
In between their victories, No. 23 Ray Sarmiento relinquished a point to the Bruins with his 3-6, 4-6 loss to No. 21 Nick Meister.
By the time Nguyen finished off UCLA’s Dennis Novikov for USC’s third point, however, the three Trojans on courts 4 through 6 were all trailing in the third set of their respective matches.
USC sophomore Emilio Gomez, ranked No. 50 in singles, was up 5-4 in the second set with the first set secured and nearly locked up another point for USC. His opponent, No. 86 Marcos Giron, however, powered back, eventually taking a 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 win.
UCLA’s Dennis Mkrtchian also rallied back in a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 finish over freshman Roberto Quiroz to deadlock the score at 3-3.
Once Quiroz dropped the final set of his match, all eyes shifted focus to court 5, where Hanfmann was already down 2-5 in the third set against Puget.
Hanfmann could not battle back, and the Bruins emerged from the match with a perfect conference record and the top seed in the upcoming Pac-12 tournament.
“It’s a tough loss to UCLA. We need to learn from it and just keep working hard,” Nguyen said. “Take them out at the Pac-12 [Tournament] — that’s the plan.”
Despite the loss, Nguyen, who will graduate with seniors Johnson and Ben Lankenau next month, expressed his appreciation for his final match at Marks Stadium.
“I can’t really explain it. It was definitely a very special moment for me,” Nguyen said. “It was great seeing my family come and watch my last match and seeing my friends support me.”
Johnson agreed, and even conceded that the one blemish to the Trojans’ nearly undefeated season could be “a blessing in disguise.”
“Daniel and I have been looking forward to this moment for forever,” Johnson said. “The outcome obviously wasn’t ideal, but I think it’s going to be a good thing in the long run. I think everyone is going to work a lot harder.”
The Trojans look to bounce back in the conference tournament, which begins Thursday in Ojai, Calif.
With the second seed, USC will have a bye for the first two rounds before beginning play in the semifinals Friday.
The ‘ruins outsmarted the Trojans by conceding the #1 singles match by moving their best player down
to the second match where it was a more even contest. Seems like it was against the fair sportsmanship
rules for playing best vs. best.
Agree completely, that was the only way UCLA was going to win, horrible sportsmanship but not surprised as it was typical UCLA.

The USC men’s volleyball squad began its postseason in dominant fashion Saturday, sweeping Cal State Northridge 25-13, 25-15, 25-18 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation quarterfinals at the Galen Center. The victory sets up a battle between the first-seeded Trojans (23-4, 18-4) and No. 2 UC Irvine (22-5, 17-5), who advanced after eliminating UCLA in four sets Saturday.
No contest · Freshman middle blocker Chris Lischke (right) helped the Trojans sweep Cal State Northridge in the first round of the MPSF tournament. USC also swept the Matadors in their last regular season meeting. - Garry Chien | Daily Trojan
As for the victory over the No. 11 Matadors (12-18, 7-14), the Trojans started the match with a blistering .556 hitting percentage in the first set. The Trojans hit an impressive .424 for the match while holding the Matadors to a .012 clip.
Senior co-captain, outside hitter and newly announced MPSF Player of the Year Tony Ciarelli played up to his honorable distinction with a match-leading six aces and 12 kills to go along with five blocks. Ciarelli also set the tone for the Trojans’ hot hitting with a .625 mark.
Freshman middle blocker Robert Feathers led all players with six blocks, redshirt junior outside hitter Steven Mochalski had nine kills, and MPSF Freshman of the Year and setter Micah Christenson had a .545 assist rate. Sophomore libero Henry Cassiday and junior opposite Maddison McKibbin led the Trojans with seven digs each.
Though the offense was firing on all cylinders, the vigilant Trojan defense was just as formidable. The Matadors committed 24 errors to the Trojans’ 10, while the Trojans held their top two hitters in Brandon Lebrock and Julius Hoefer to a combined .117 mark.
“We got in a little bit of a better rhythm and got a better feel for how to play them,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said.
This game was a rematch of the two squads’ final regular season match, where the Trojans won in straight sets at Northridge.
In the first set, the Matadors played the Trojans close to a score of 11-9 before two Ciarelli aces in a row sparked a 5-0 run after which the Trojans didn’t look back. Ciarelli hit four aces in the set, while poor passing by the Matadors led to easy kills for the Trojans.
The second set started out shaky for the Trojans, as the Matadors took a 7-4 lead. The opposing bench also took this lead as an opportunity to taunt Ciarelli about the Trojans’ loss in the Final Four last season. Bad idea. Ciarelli followed this with two consecutive kills followed by two consecutive blocks to put the Trojans back up.
The Trojans fell behind again 11-12 in the set, but had an 11-2 stretch to win the set.
“We didn’t push the panic button or burn a timeout or anything like that,” Ferguson said.
As for Ferguson’s take on one taunting Ciarelli: “Don’t poke the bear.”
In the third and deciding set, the Trojans’ precise hitting combined with poor returning by Cal State Northridge led to a 25-18 victory that was never really in doubt.
The only minor concern was that MPSF 2nd-teamer and senior co-captain and middle blocker Steven Shandrick sat out the final set after a possible injury in the second set.
“There’s nothing more than just being banged up,” Ferguson said. “It’s the end of the season. Stuff hurts.”
Irvine is the #4 seed that is why they played #5 ucla in the quarterfinals. Stanford was the # 2 seed in the
conference tournament.

Many writers have struggled with the coming-of-age concept. Even though some authors believe they have accurately depicted the “crazy” world of teenagers, writers’ portrayals often end up looking desperate and out of touch.
It doesn’t help that generational gaps are often far too large for adults to truly understand the current teenage mindset: How often have we listened to our parents painfully try — and fail — to sing along to Drake?
Teenage wasteland · Steinberg bridges the generational gap between teens and adults in his realistic coming-of-age novel Last Stop This Town. - Photo courtesy of David H. Steinberg
Unless you’re a part of a generation, it can be very difficult to accurately portray it. And the worst part is that this difficulty so readily appears in works that purport themselves to be genuine.
Author David H. Steinberg’s Last Stop This Town, however, is an outlier. Steinberg, screenwriter for movies like American Pie 2 and Slackers, has crafted a novel that is impressively in touch with this generation and speaks honestly to it. Though most novels grasp at straws in an attempt to seem authentic, Steinberg is able to look into the inner psyche of the teenager.
And in an effort to “tap into” Generation X, many authors lose insight into what life means to young people, despite these stereotypes; Steinberg has, impressively, avoided that here.
Last Stop This Town tells the story of several male high school seniors living their last few weeks of adolescence: Soon, they will be making their trek as adults into a world with uncertain futures. And though the premise might seem tired, Steinberg expertly portrays the lives of these characters, exploring them in depth.
Plenty of novels include the customary “friendship pack”: A group of seniors promise to lose their virginity or live every last high school day to its fullest. But Last Stop This Town understands the power of stereotypes and manages to enforce and twist them around to create an interesting and hilarious narrative.
Four best friends comprise the novel’s main cast of characters, and though they each carry their specific personality — the guy who gets around, the stoner, the friend always arguing with his girlfriend and the one who’s just there to see it all — each of the characters are so fully explored in depth that readers feel as if they know the characters’ personally.
Dylan, who Steinberg describes as a boy with a “vintage Zac Efron thing going on with his hair,” is an attractive young man with the world at his feet.
In the hands of any other writer, Dylan could fall into a caricature and be a stiffly successful, vanilla bore of a character. Steinberg, however, somehow toes the line between stereotype and real life, filling the character with the right amount of whimsy and ridiculousness to make him seem real.
Last Stop This Town wisely utilizes the third person and doesn’t delve too much into veiled metaphors; instead of having to figure things out, readers are simply — but effectively — given the insight to what each character is thinking, allowing you to concentrate on the laughs and not any ridiculous symbolism.
That’s partly what Steinberg does so well: He knows exactly what kind of writer he needs to be and doesn’t try to overextend his reach. There are no painful attempts to be artistic or any forced jargon. Instead, Steinberg has simply written what he knows, and it reads as authenticity at its best.
Some might be tempted to compare Last Stop This Town to the American Pie series. Yes, the novel reeks of American Pie influences, but it’s understandable considering Steinberg’s work as a screenwriter on the seminal coming-of-age series.
Though the American Pie films were everything short of artistic, they were certainly funny and real. Last Stop This Town is another example of the coming-of-age narrative done right, and Steinberg wisely conveys the most important element of the of story: the characters.
To be fair, Last Stop This Town isn’t perfect. Most notably, the novel falls into a bit of hackneyed territory whenever the characters are alone and there’s no one to exchange hilarious witty banter with.
Still, that’s a small price to pay to be able to finally experience teenagers just being teenagers: no vampires, no werewolves, no dystopian last-person-standing battles — just boys ready and excited to start the rest of their lives.

La Placita Olvera and the streets around it are rich with history, but oftentimes this history might not be apparent to the visitors who flock to the area looking for authentic Mexican restaurants or a unique shopping experience.
Thankfully, there exists a year-old museum that casts light on the formation of Los Angeles and the history of Mexican people in the city — and does so free of charge.
Tucked in a corner next to La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora Reina de Los Ángeles lies LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, a museum dedicated to chronicling the history of Mexicans and the rise of Chicanos in Los Angeles. Through artifacts, videos, interactive portions and creative displays, the museum takes visitors on a journey from the Spanish invasion of California to current-day issues relating to Mexican- and Hispanic-American people.
The museum connects its historical content with present-day visitors by dedicating its first introductory segment, L.A. Today: We Are the Future, to Los Angeles and its Hispanic and Latino inhabitants. The room contains photographs and video clips of Hispanic and Latino people of different backgrounds tied together by Los Angeles. The three floors of the museum focus not only on exposing visitors to Mexico’s past and the struggles of Hispanic and Latino people in general, but also lend these events a sense of importance in the present day.
The first floor focuses on the history of the Spanish settlement of California. Visitors can read about the historical timeline with artifacts including wardrobe, guns and tools. The exhibit also highlights the shaping of California with a video portion describing street history and a giant creation in the shape of the state with a video projected onto its surface.
From the onset, the museum uses creative curatorial techniques to keep visitors engaged. The museum uses quotes, photographs, videos, lit displays and more to create an interactive experience — a must for museums that might be dismissed as too stiflingly historical.
After visitors take in facts about Spanish settlers and the formation of the city, the museum explores the decades up until today that led to the formation of Mexican identity in a new society. Through looking at social issues and popular culture of the times, the museum manages to not only shed light on important struggles but also to communicate what the city looked like in past decades.
Again, the museum takes into consideration the vast amount of information and balances this overload with creative set-ups. Covering so many decades proves no easy feat but the layout of the exhibits help echo the overall themes; one section on social struggles, for example, has text and photographs set up behind a fence.
The second floor offers the most aesthetically ambitious part of the museum and focuses on Main Street in Downtown Los Angeles and what it looked like in the 1920s. The floor is an impressively faithful recreation of the street, down to the lampposts. The floor allows visitors to walk through the space, as if they were walking down the street, while also setting up rooms that the visitor can walk into.
Among these lies a room set up to look like a medicine store, one that appears to be a phonograph and record store and another that recreates a photography studio. The record store provides listening samples for visitors to browse.
The studio lets visitors sit in the place of people getting their traditional portraits taken by a very different-looking camera than today’s digital contraptions.
A box to the side provides sitters with everything from gloves to hats to pearls in order to dress up and pose on a small couch in front of a painted backdrop. The second floor also focuses on the history of architecture in the city.
The third floor contains various artworks, including some impressive papier-mâché creations. By the time visitors reach this floor, they will have read about important Mexican social movement figures, sat in front of significant works of art and walked through the city as it lay decades ago.
The museum includes a segment where visitors can sit in a photo-booth-like area and record their thoughts on a variety of topics. Because the museum focuses on the struggles of Mexicans in California, migration and the Spanish settlers, this portion opens itself to all sides; the optional questions suggest that the visitors talk about everything from why their parents came to California to whether they disagree with anything in the museum.
Free of cost and near important cultural locations, the museum proves a location worth exploring regardless of a prospective visitor’s ethnicity and background. Walking through the recreation of Main Street calls to mind that Los Angeles’ inhabitants ultimately have a shared history that can come to light once again as visitors take in L.A.’s past and Hispanic heritage.

Because of letting the visitors sit in the place of people getting their traditional portraits taken by a very different-looking camera than today’s digital contraptions, this would surely be a big help help for the people who visited the museum.

With predictable storylines, cookie-cutter characters and formulaic plot structure, it would seem that romantic comedies are on the verge of being played out. Studios often butt heads over the same trite concepts in films like No Strings Attached and Friends with Benefits or resort to extremes to disguise a hackneyed plot, such as What Happens in Vegas.
Fortunately, director and USC School of Cinematic Arts alumnus Tim Story has managed to shatter the rom-com mold and bring a little originality into a slowly dying genre.
A self-proclaimed “dramedy” director, Story concerns himself with using real life as a basis for successful entertainment.
“I live for those moments where it’s just reality,” Story said. “If you can capture reality, that’s what makes people laugh.”
Story got a fairly early start on filmmaking. He obtained his first camera at the age of 12 and started shooting his own films before studying cinema more intensely at the high school level. SCA grabbed Story’s attention a bit prematurely — he applied to SCA in 10th grade and was initially turned down. But Story was eventually accepted into SCA and studied under one of his most influential professors, Drew Casper, providing him with the tools to further his own career.
“There’s a stamina that USC prepares you for, a stamina and a collaboration,” Story said. “Back then you couldn’t get film easily, and we all helped one another.”
But the relationship between Story and SCA wasn’t one-sided. Story’s background, which features directorial work on 1990s music videos for ’N Sync, Tyrese and Jagged Edge and several successful films such as Taxi, Fantastic Four and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, adds a little more prestige to a film school with several successful alumni. However, Story’s first mainstream film Barbershop put him in a category of “atypical black directors” who create “black movies,” which Story refutes.
“I don’t make black films,” Story said. “I make movies that just happen to have black people in them.”
Story’s latest film, Think Like a Man, based off the book Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man: What Men Really Think About Love, Relationships, Intimacy and Commitment by Steve Harvey, follows a series of romantic storylines that are connected by friendships and the common goal of finding love in Los Angeles.
The movie starts off like many other romantic comedies, with women expressing their desires to find a suitable partner and men looking for a good time, but the plot quickly escalates to a battle of the sexes as the four heroines, played by Taraji P. Henson, Gabrielle Union, Meagan Good and Regina Hall, stumble across Harvey’s love manual and attempt to apply it to their own lives. When the guys catch on to their scheme, the film quickly turns into a hilarious portrayal of relationships that is both realistic and tinged with conventional Hollywood drama.
“I read the script and just laughed out loud,” Story said. “I have a weird sense of humor. Barbershop and this movie were my sense of humor. I like to laugh, and when I find material that makes me laugh, it’s great.”
Story’s humor is anything but weird. Think Like a Man provides one of the most genuinely hilarious films since the release of the critically acclaimed Bridesmaids (2011). Though you would expect stand-up comedian Kevin Hart to dominate many of the film’s humorous scenes, the cast gives off a striking comedic balance that keeps the audience guessing as to where the next joke will come from. In addition, cameos from stars, such as Wendy Williams, Kelly Rowland, Sherri Shepherd, Keri Hilson and Harvey, make the film fun and enjoyable.
Admittedly, much of the humor arises from the differing points of view of the film’s characters. By having an all-star cast to argue both female and male points of view, Think Like a Man sets itself apart from traditional romantic comedies that usually cater to a female audience.
“It’s one of the first movies that I’ve seen — or definitely that I’ve made — that tells the story from the guy’s point of view,” Story said. “That’s what I really liked about it. I only judge from the way the audience reacts, but there’s a lot on the screen that shows what guys think. It’s unfiltered.”
Though each character is different — Hart plays the oddball comedian while Michael Ealy plays a charming guy who is a bit of a dream chaser — all are extremely likable and startlingly realistic, which provides a worldly context for the character’s situations.
Hall, for example, plays Candace, a single mother who is looking for a man that will love her and her son, Duke. When she meets Michael (Terrence Jenkins), who is a bit of a mama’s boy, she finds someone who might appreciate her maternal endeavors just a little too much and, suddenly, what she wants most becomes her biggest problem.
The film draws on several of these pairings to comment on larger relationship issues within the real world.
Henson plays Lauren, a career-oriented CEO who is often called “manly” because of her professional success. Romany Malco plays Zeke, a womanizer figure, who uses sex to get over a broken heart. Good plays Mya, an intellectual young woman tired of using hooking up as a way to snag a man.
Think Like a Man’s hilarity serves as a way to comically acknowledge and provide helpful solutions for contemporary issues in relationships.
The only drawback? The continual laughter means losing some of the jokes.
 
Think Like a Man is now playing in theaters.

Fostering community isn’t just about providing funding. 
Campus organizations grant students the opportunity to express themselves, satisfy their interests and share their passion with others. In turn, these organizations make USC a better place to live and learn.
But while the community thrives on its own, it relies on the university to support it. Fostering community is the administration’s most important responsibility outside of improving academics.
USC does an excellent job of supporting community organizations by granting them access to its resources. But supporting community does not end with funding. Providing forums for student groups to communicate with one another and to reach the community is just as important.
The Ronald Tutor Campus Center should support the organic growth of a dynamic and interconnected university community. Unfortunately, it fails to do so, putting institutional goals like fundraising and increasing prestige ahead of the community.
The first floor of the main building looks more like the inside of a corporate high rise than any part of a college campus, and the sitting room beyond the lobby is a hushed, reverent space that glorifies USC as an institution.
The International Plaza is always packed with students and could do very much to foster community. Instead, the plaza is a surprisingly difficult place for campus organizations to reach students. Nowhere in the entire Plaza can a poster, flier or community message of any form be posted. According to SCampus, putting fliers on the tables in the Plaza or using sidewalk chalk on the ground anywhere on campus is prohibited and punishable by fines.
The design of the campus center and its policies bely any vision of a university community characterized by youth, energy, spontaneity and independence.
I urge the administration to make the simple changes that will make USC a much more hospitable place to its own community.
Erect bulletin boards in the International Plaza and across campus. Allow student groups to promote themselves on the sidewalk with chalk. In the EVK Restaurant and Grill and The Parkside Restaurant, play KXSC Radio. Renovate the dilapidated Trojan Vision kiosk on Trousdale, and replace MTVU on the Lyon Center’s television screens with programming from Trojan Vision.
In doing so, you will reward students for their hard work and allow them to learn. USC will be an even better place than it is now, and the Trojan Family will be stronger than ever before.

I totally agree! The dream would be to have a Campus and Community Center where community groups and student groups as well as University resources could be available. Thanks for putting these ideas in writing!

Many of us know the feeling all too well: It shows up unexpectedly in the form of sweaty palms and rapid heart rate, and it lasts anywhere from a few minutes to a few days.
Anxiety is anything but foreign to college students.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Most likely, as you prepared for college, your friends and family said the next four years would be “the time of your life.” But with the stress that college creates, it is not uncommon to find depression and anxiety becoming a fixture in students’ lives — anything but what you might have expected.
Though USC offers group and individual counseling services and the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion offers many resources for students to learn about managing anxiety, stress and depression, more needs to be done to ensure that the USC student body is healthy and happy.
In a survey of USC undergraduates in 2009, graduate and undergraduate students reported experiencing anxiety and depression in the last year, with 13.6 percent of undergraduate and 17.4 percent of graduate students reporting they had been diagnosed with depression.
Almost 18 percent of undergraduate students at USC reported that anxiety affected their academic performance in the last year. An additional 28 reported being affected by general stress. 13 percent reported being affected by depression.
A small amount of stress and anxiety can be healthy and will motivate you to study or complete a task. But too much can be detrimental to your psychological and physical health.
Anxiety is an umbrella term for a range of emotional disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and so on.
The way anxiety manifests in one individual can be quite different from that in another, which is why it can sometimes be difficult for professionals and non-professionals to identify it.
Oftentimes, in a clinic, issues concerning physical health are managed first because they are more visible. Treating emotional ailments, however, is just as important.
Anxiety can have large repercussions if it is not dealt with. Episodic anxiety can manifest in frequent panic attacks. Low levels of anxiety can also become debilitating.
But once you or another does identify an anxiety disorder, who do you talk to? What can you do to combat this?
The resources available at USC are not talked about as much as they should be. Simply getting the conversation started about anxiety and related emotional disorders would be a huge step to diminish the stigma surrounding such diagnoses, allowing many students to get the help they need so that their four years at USC can, in fact, be the best of their lives.
Whether you are stressed about graduating in the middle of an economic recession or simply overwhelmed by the amount of material on your final organic chemistry exam, be sure to assess how you are feeling and determine whether the amount of anxiety is manageable.
Exercising, eating well, being with friends and taking quiet time for yourself have been proven to aid in anxiety and other emotional disorders. Still, sometimes these steps are not enough — and that’s not a sign of weakness.
If the need arises, seek professional help and do not be ashamed for doing so. If you had an unmanageable cold, you would see your physician. Experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety or depression is no different.
Take control of your emotional well-being; this is your time to thrive.

Great article!  I am so glad that you mention eating well.  Eating a whole food diet with mostly plant foods can help with brain chemistry.  Drinking plenty of fresh clean water will also help.  We are starting to recognize what a key roll food plays in our health and in the near future begin to use it as fuel again, not recreation.  Let food by thy medicine.
