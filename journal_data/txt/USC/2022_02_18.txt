USC will no longer require weekly surveillance testing for fully vaccinated and boosted students starting March 1, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman announced in a communitywide email Friday.
“Students who are up to date on their vaccinations (fully vaccinated; and have received a booster if currently eligible) are no longer required to test weekly,” the email read. “Testing requirements for unvaccinated with approved exemption (every 72 hours) and individuals not up to date on vaccinations (every 4 days) remain in effect.”
Outdoor masking is no longer required effective Feb. 16. Effective March 1, the University will allow guests who are current USC students in residence halls — reversing the “no-guest” policy reinstated Dec. 29. The University will also no longer require reservations to access USC gyms. 
The announcement comes after the student positivity rate dropped to 1.31% last week, down from a 14.79% peak reported for the week of Jan. 2. The positivity rate for employees fell to 0.87% from a 13.33% high reported for the week of Dec. 26.
A March 1 transition guide attached to Friday’s email provided additional details on masking and testing requirements. 
The University will continue its indoor masking requirement and Trojan Check enforcement, and testing remains available for symptomatic individuals and individuals who have had an exposure to a positive person. Vaccines and booster doses remain “available to the campus community” at clinics around the University Park and Health Sciences campuses, according to the transition guide.
“We appreciate the efforts of our students, faculty, and staff who have collectively created a protected environment with adherence to the vaccination, booster, and testing requirements,” Van Orman wrote. “At this point in the pandemic, we are looking at the future with plans to modify protocols that remove mitigation levels as public health orders are revised to lift restrictions.”
USC Student Health administered its 1 millionth coronavirus test Monday prior to the announced policy changes.

Black and white long exposure photographs, various forms of sculptures, garments and a painting lined the walls of Brian Xu’s first solo exhibition, “Body and Soul.” The exhibition had its opening reception at the Helen Lindhurst Gallery at Watt Hall on Feb. 2 and was on view at the gallery until Wednesday. The high-quality archival prints being exhibited can be purchased after the show.
Hailing from an oceanside town Half Moon Bay, Xu, a senior majoring in fine arts, has always had an interest in art. 
“I guess I have always been doing art in some senses, even when I was young. I started getting more serious about it in high school and ended up going to college studying [fine arts],” Xu said. 
Prior to launching his first solo exhibition at USC, Xu had a pop-up exhibition at a small restaurant in his hometown. “Body and Soul” embodies the multimedium concepts which Xu tried to investigate and develop in college. 
Hanging on the gallery walls were Xu’s photographic works, capturing the movement of models in specially designed garments.
The long exposure techniques blurred the distinct outlines of the human bodies, creating a formless yet dynamic visual experience for the audience. Xu said that the special part of the show is the abstraction of the human body. 
“Some of the shapes that you see — these long exposure silhouettes — these are actually the same humans,” Xu said. “[By incorporating] garments and more time and more movements into them, they almost take on a sort of alien form or an alien shape.”
Xu said that he came up with the theme of his exhibition because he sees the soul as the intangible part of each individual. The body, on the other hand, is the pathway through which people see their souls. The human body, in conjunction with time and movement, enables people to see the wisps of part of their identities.
“Every person has a unique way of moving,” Xu said. “Most of the time, these subtle differences go overlooked or unnoticed … To tap into the body as a material of art helps people to tap into the rudimentary essence of humanity.”
Aside from being a skillful photographer, Xu is also an exceptional painter, sculptor and garment designer and incorporated various forms of media to convey his thoughts on “Body and Soul.” These creations, along with the photographic works, brought inspiring and innovative experiences for the audience. 
Isaiah Reyes, a sophomore majoring in applied and computational mathematics, served as a model for the photos. Models wore garments with “black bean bags” sewn onto them, which he quickly realized aided the visual distortions of the figures in the photographs.  
“Looking at the pictures of how they are all distorted represents the separation from body and soul, and how the soul represents the more distorted pictures in the body,” Reyes said. “How the lines are blurred between body and soul was a very interesting concept that I got from it.” 
The collaboration of the garment and long exposure photography also brought an unexpected visual beauty to the audience. Each garment was intricate and necessarily different for Xu. 
“They were sort of inspired by the blobs, like a sort of psychological trauma in a sense,” Xu said. “I wanted to see how the body can be weighed down by these malignant blobs that can plague us.”
Chika Ojukwu, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science, attended the exhibition after seeing flyers on campus. Ojukwu also expressed her fascination with the garments and the painting that Xu created. 
“Something that I have never seen in an exhibition before was how he handled costumes from the ceilings,” Ojukwu said. “It was so cool to see the difference between the lifeless clothes themselves compared to the photographs.” 
Another piece that left a deep impression on Ojukwu was Xu’s flesh and bone painting, with a dark blue backdrop and bright colors. Ojukwu said she enjoyed seeing the colors and contrast between the hardlines of the bone and the flesh and the contrast between the painting and the black and white photos.
The exhibition gave Ojukwu an introspective feeling and drew a connection between what she sees and how she feels about herself. 
“Through going through this exhibition … the white walls, the silence of the bigger room and like everything’s at opposite ends, it just kind of felt like I was in this huge space where I had the kind of space to actually think about my own body and soul,” she said.
Xu’s unique perspective and creation of multimedium arts have drawn appreciation from his audience. Xu attributed his interdisciplinary perspective to his years of study at the Roski School of Art and Design. 
“There is not a specific focus on one medium that you have to master throughout your whole, you know, [throughout] the course of time,” Xu said. “I think that the interdisciplinary approach of Roski has helped develop a unique sense of creativity.”
Xu said he intends to continue creating art and showcasing his work in additional exhibitions in the future.  
“I guess one idea that I have is I want to continue building off of these silhouettes, shapes and forms that are formed from long exposure movements,” Xu said. “Thinking about the different mediums, both physical and digital, that the long exposure infused human captures can take could be interesting as further development.”

Ever wanted to fall into the world of your childhood imagination? Bake desserts for cute little creatures? Indulge in the innocence of your youngest hopes and dreams? 
Whether you’re a seasoned veteran at playing games or a beginner simply looking for your next game to try, Dreamland Confectionery, an action-adventure PC game developed and designed by a team of USC students, might satisfy your sweet interests.
The idea for Dreamland Confectionery first sprouted when Ah Young Joo, a senior majoring in interactive media and game design, took an “Intermediate Game Development” course in her junior year. Though the versions have grown in its gradual expansion, the team has remained faithful to the game’s core conceptual ideas: baking and exploration. 
A game encompasses numerous elements like audio (dialogue and composed music), 2D and 3D visuals, writing and engineering, which Joo explained makes collaboration especially critical for a game driven by its storytelling.
“Games basically mix [art and engineering] almost equally because art is super into creating the experience, and you need the engineering to make the game,” said Joo about the interdisciplinary work that goes into a video game. “I think it provides this well-rounded environment where even if you’re not an engineer, you’ll be able to be around artists or audio people or pretty much all departments go into making a game.”
Weston Bell-Geddes, a junior majoring in interactive entertainment and cinematic arts, is a producer and marketing lead for the game. For him, games are a medium for self-expression. 
“In a video game, you can actually make choices,” he said.
The team has worked remotely, communicating through platforms like Discord until recently.  Working together virtually allowed more flexibility for team members to contribute when they were able  and connect from wherever they happened to be, Joo said. 
For example, art lead Irmak (Max) Cavun worked remotely from Turkey, which has an 11-hour time difference with Los Angeles. 
However far they were, Cavun recalls the remote working environment as memorable because it brought about an increased sense of community with team members. 
“I enjoyed, and I still do enjoy, being able to work with very different people and around the world,” said Cavun, a sophomore majoring in interactive entertainment. “Cause there’s [team members] that don’t go to USC and that don’t even live in the United States, and as far as I know, that’s not something you encounter very much in other USC game projects.” 
The team will be presenting this demo version at Steam Next Fest, a virtual festival that will take place Feb. 21 through Feb. 28.
Dreamland Confectionery’s narrative, written by the team, follows Ami, an adult who falls into the imaginary wonderland she created during her childhood. She embarks on a journey to discover the key to waking up from her dream while encountering spirits and gaining their abilities by befriending and baking treats to satisfy their sweet tooth along the way. By the end of this journey, Ami recovers the important dreams she pushed away in her reality. 
Players will follow Ami through her magical fantasy wonderland. 
“It’s full of all that magical delight,” Joo said. “But at the same time, it’s not just another fantasy world.” 
Ami’s story touches on mental health themes such as anxiety and depression. Emphasizing the importance of balancing depth with fun, the team hopes that players find details in the game that personally resonate with them — a point that makes a game particularly special. 
But instead of hoping that players pay attention to certain things about the game, Cavun said, reiterating Joo’s previous statement that the creative team wants Dreamland players to experience the world for themselves, instead of being directed by creators.
“We are building the world; we are building the characters. There’s a world; there are these memories. There’s these characters, [and] they’re complex, and they have all these things that you know you wouldn’t be able to fit into a game,” Cavun said. “But they’re there in the small details, like for example, in the pictures and the frames you can find around the world, or small moments or remnants of their memories, and so on. They’re just there. We’re not forcing anyone to look at them, but if they wanted to, they can and that will lead to a portrayal of some [intentional] themes.”
Dreamland Confectionery will launch its playable demo version next Monday on its steam page, available for anyone with a Steam account, Bell-Geddes said.
The team currently aims to release an early access version of the game to receive feedback from the local and global community. 
Dreamland Confectionery is so special because of more than the actual game, Bell-Geddes said. The best part of the project are the amazing people involved and their passion for the project. 
“It is inspiring because this isn’t really a class project, right? Everyone on this project and USC Games, they’re not doing it for credit, for money or anything. They’re doing it because they love the project and they really want it to succeed,” Bell-Geddes said. “This project is 100% driven by dedication and enjoyment for the people that are working on it, and for the passion and enthusiasm of making a really, really great game.”

USC will play its final batch of regular-season home games against Utah Friday and Colorado Sunday. Sophomore forward Jordyn Jenkins will look to continue her hot streak, scoring double figures in 14 straight games. 
Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb remains optimistic about the season ahead of senior night.
 “I think the beauty of college basketball is that there’s always a chance to win your conference tournament,” said Gottlieb in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
Many held high expectations for the former Cleveland Cavaliers assistant coach going into the season. However, amid bright spots and a three-game streak to start the season, there have also been low points such as their seven-game losing streak.
The Trojans stand at 10-13 overall with four games left in the regular-season, including two Pac-12 foes at home this weekend. 
 The Utes currently rank fifth in the Pac-12 with a 6-5 conference record, while the Buffaloes are ninth with a 5-7 conference record. USC currently sits 11th but could move up to 10th with two wins this weekend.
Despite the Trojans’ loss to Utah Feb. 9, Gottlieb said the team hopes to build on exposed weaknesses in preparation for Friday’s matchup.
“It’s a unique opportunity with Utah because we just played them a couple of days ago,” Gottlieb said. “They’re such a potent offensive team that we’re just working on a higher level of intensity on defense for 40 minutes … not having any lapses on our end because they’re so good that they’ll take advantage.”
Gottlieb said USC wants to be the aggressors on offense for 40 minutes, highlighting they want to play as well as they can for their last home weekend. The head coach also added that Jenkins “is playing at a higher level, as really as any player [Gottlieb] seen for a while.”
Jenkins has been the Trojans’ lead scorer in the last six games with multiple 20-point performances, including a 29-point outburst in USC’s victory against Washington last Friday. Gottlieb said she’s noticed Jenkins has acted confident when getting to her spots.
“She’s really talented and is capable of anything that she believes she’s capable of,” Gottlieb said. “We’ve seen her growth throughout this year on how to find her spots. Now she’s the focus of defensive double-coverages and physicality and she’s just able to navigate it because she understands really what she’s capable of.”
In light of senior night, Gottlieb specifically pointed out the energy of graduate student guard Tera Reed, graduate student forward Jordan Sanders and senior guard Desiree Caldwell.
While knowing the fans will make it a special night, Gottlieb personally wants to make it memorable for the seniors. Gottlieb said she hopes to honor them during the game and in a private moment post-game. 
“The best way you can honor your seniors is by going out having a great week of prep and playing our tails off,” Gottleib said. “I think that’s the vibe this week.”
Gottlieb said she hasn’t ruled out a magical ending to their season and is always looking to the future.
“We want to put everything into this year and be as competitive as possible to try and shock some people and have a chance to go to the Pac-12 tournament and do something magical,” she said. “That said, because it’s a long-term journey for me as well, it’s making sure that we’re continuing to lay the foundation that will set us at the highest level possible in the years to come so just doing things the right way day in and day out.”
With the Pac-12 tournament set to start in two weeks, USC will first face Utah and Colorado in a two game stretch at Galen Center.

​​After an opening season 18-7 victory over San Diego State Saturday, USC will hit the road and head southeast for two games in Florida and Georgia.  
The Trojans secured their seventh straight season-opening win over the weekend. USC was led by redshirt freshman attacker Isabelle Vitale who scored 4 goals — all in the first quarter. 
Additionally, both junior attacker Ella Heaney and graduate student midfielder Kelsey Huff recorded hat tricks. In goal, transfer sophomore Kait Devir put up 9 saves in her first collegiate start. Devir’s performance had her named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week. With the win, USC improved to 11-1 all-time against the Aztecs. 
“It was a great first step for us — really proud of how we executed,” said Head Coach Lindsey Munday in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I’m proud of how we started, but really, it’s just a starting point for us.” 
Leading scorer, Vitale, is also proud of the team’s performance and looks forward to future opportunities. 
“I feel great after the game,” Vitale said. “The offense was clicking on all cylinders and we are just looking forward to playing a ranked team on Friday.”
As the team heads to the southeast this weekend, first up for the Trojans is a Friday game against ranked non-conference opponent, No. 18 Jacksonville University. The Dolphins come off a weekend victory against Virginia Tech. Jacksonville put up a strong performance, beating the Hokies 15-6 and outshooting them 32-21. 
The last time USC faced the Dolphins was in its 2019 Pac-12 Championship season. The Trojans’ all-time record against Jacksonville is 2-0. A win in the matchup over a ranked opponent can get USC back into the IWLCA Division I Poll. 
Jacksonville is known as a high-energy, physical team with a history of successes. During Munday’s time as head coach, she has faced several high-pressure opponents similar to the Dolphins, and she knows what’s required of her team to be successful.
“The main thing for us just all over the field is to be composed and to still stay within our plan and system while handling pressure” Munday said. 
Following the game against Jacksonville Sunday morning, the Trojans will head up to Macon, Ga. to take on Mercer University. This will be the first time the Trojans and Bears face off in women’s lacrosse. 
Mercer begins its regular season against Oregon Friday night. This will be the first season the Bears compete as a member of the Big South after their previous membership in the Southern Conference. The Bears were picked to finish second in the Big South and had multiple players named to the preseason All-Conference team.  
There are several keys to the team’s success this weekend, but Vitale emphasized the importance of communication, effort and handling pressure. These two matchups will be the first away games of the season for the Trojans. Both Jacksonville and Mercer are very important early-season tests before USC begins conference play in March. 
USC will head to the East Coast for meetings against No. 18 Jacksonville Friday in Florida and against Mercer Sunday in Georgia.

The reeling Los Angeles Lakers, currently sitting ninth seed in the Western Conference, did not make a single move before the NBA trade deadline on Feb. 10.
But after an offseason of swings and misses from General Manager Rob Pelinka, he finally got it right — doing nothing was the best option. 
The Lakers were reportedly in talks to trade point guard Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets for point guard John Wall, who has not played a minute of NBA basketball since April 2020. The Lakers declined the offer when the Rockets asked for the Lakers’ 2027 first round pick, Pelinka’s sole prized possession. 
The only other marginal asset the Lakers have is shooting guard Talen Horton-Tucker, a 21-year-old slasher who has shown glimpses of potential but has not put it all together yet. The idea of Horton-Tucker — who currently averages just over 9 points per game on 41% from the field — is a lot more exciting than the reality of what the shooting guard brings to the table. 
In not trading Horton-Tucker or the 2027 first round pick for a marginal upgrade, there seems to be a clear disconnect between the Lakers front office and its superstars. LeBron is 37-years-old and center Anthony Davis seems to go down with injuries as if he is 37-years-old too. Neither care about draft picks or the franchise’s future — they want to win now. 
Pelinka chose to hold his superstars accountable — James wanted Davis in 2020, and both wanted Westbrook a year later, leaving the front office with depleted resources to work with. By making no moves at the trade deadline, Pelinka seemed to tell his stars to fix the mess they made.
So where do the Lakers go from here? 
There is no saving grace, no one who is going to come in and serve as a wake up call. It’s the same squad that has brought them to a 27-31 record, with the same coaching staff and front office. The whole organization has to be better. 
Realistically, the Lakers will be in the play-in tournament, in a pool with teams such as the Minnesota Timberwolves, Los Angeles Clippers and Portland Trail Blazers. All of them are hoping to get a shot at the top dogs in the West against the Phoenix Suns and the Golden State Warriors.
Offensively, Head Coach Frank Vogel needs to implement a legitimate system and that begins with Davis playing his true center position. His shooting, vertical spacing and quality finishing around the rim is the only way to maximize results from this Westbrook experiment.
Vogel began the season with 33-year-old center DeAndre Jordan manning the middle, clogging the paint offensively and providing no resistance at the rim defensively. Jordan, who is a complete shell of his All-Star self, has started 19 games this season due to Vogel’s stubbornness — Jordan shouldn’t, and probably won’t, see the floor for the rest of the season. 
The offense needs an actual playbook, not simply the repetitive pick-and-roll that eventually leads into one of the Big 3 hoping to score on a mismatch while the other four players on the court stand around. 
Off-ball cutting, off-ball screening and more creativity from Vogel can transform this stationary team into a threatening offense — they have LeBron James and Anthony Davis, so this shouldn’t be as difficult as Vogel makes it seem. 
Defensively, each player needs to buy in and compete. Vogel’s 2020 Lakers team was a defensive juggernaut, and while this squad lacks the personnel, they’ve also lacked adequate effort, resulting in the 16th best defensive rating in the league.
The Lakers are going to be in the play-in tournament regardless. But it is crucial that the squad begins to build proper habits post-All-Star break, if they want to come out of the tournament and apply some pressure to the Suns or Warriors in the first round. 
There has to be a mindset change from the whole organization if they don’t want to embarrassingly crash and burn off the road to revival.

The USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future took part in the second installment of the Unify America Challenge from Feb. 7 to Feb. 10. About 30 USC students and more than 900 participants nationwide accepted the challenge, which consists of an hour-long guided discussion between college students that hold different views regarding politics and policy. 
Prior to the event, students completed a questionnaire describing their political views and location. Students later matched with someone with different views and a different location and met with them via video call. Participants took turns discussing a set of around 25 questions about social issues, including healthcare, women’s rights, immigration and climate change. According to the CPF website, the event intends to “bridge partisan divides” and help participants to realize they share more ideas in common than those that divide them. 
“They’re here to learn. They’re here to have an open mind. They’re here to be curious,” said CPF Executive Director Kamy Akhavan. “They’re here to step out of their bubble and connect with somebody who is different from them,”
If participants share the same ideas or are from the same location, organizers match participants with someone with similar ideas and provide previously recorded answers of someone with diverging ideas. Unify America Director of Partnerships Abby Ferguson said both modalities of the challenge have had overwhelmingly positive feedback.
“The point is not for participants to break down and say, ‘We agree on every issue.’ The point is to create some consensus to say, ‘Out of 24 questions about very serious issues our country faces, we actually agree on probably 18 of them,’” Ferguson said. “Eighty five percent or so of the time, [participants] say they would recommend this exercise to someone else.” 
Although Akhavan said it does not happen often, the procedure for rising tensions during a conversation is to leave. Although students go into the challenge with good intentions, the conversations may turn awkward and no one is judged for choosing to leave.
“It’s not easy to have conversations with political opposites sometimes, but like anything in life, the skill we’re building cannot be built in a single session,” Akhavan said. “We’re not as polarized as the media sometimes leads us to believe and that there is a lot of goodness in other people, even if we disagree on policy issues.”
What sets Unify America apart from other organizations with a similar conversational style, such as Living Room Conversations, is that by using video calls, they are able to connect students on opposite sides of the country. As a self-paced activity without moderators, students are encouraged to adhere to guidelines set in advance and listen with an open mind, according to Akhavan. Additionally, aided by “funky illustrations” and “quirky characters,” the organization appeals specifically to college students, Ferguson said.
Zain Khan, a freshman majoring in international relations, said his experience participating in the challenge was different from his expectations. The algorithm matched Khan with a student who shared similar ideologies as him. However, he said the event still provided him an educational opportunity. 
“We definitely learned how this helps our perspective on things,” Khan said.
Khan said the challenge was a success, partially because his partner heard his opinions. However, it was not so successful in that he did not get to interact with someone with opposing ideologies. Nonetheless, he found it “interesting and stimulating” and recommends the experience to other students.
“I feel like everyone has to be politically involved, especially in today’s world,” Khan said. “Those who say that they don’t want to are just either lazy or don’t want to partake in today’s world. I would encourage everyone, because it helps you understand why someone thinks the way they do.”
CPF promotes similar events throughout the year to help create pathways that combine multiple ideologies to create solutions for today’s problems. It held more than 75 events last year with over 50 partners and encouraged students to participate whenever an event interests them, Akhavan said. 
“Our goal as an organization is not to get people to disagree less; disagreement is fine. The problem is that we need to disagree better, so that our conflict does not become a fight, where we are opponents but not enemies,” Akhavan said. “These kinds of workshops, seminars, activities, events and programs are really designed to help us connect with each other as humans.”

Feb. 1 marked the first time in 19 years that Black History Month and the Lunar New Year began on the same day.
USC Communications saw it as an opportunity to celebrate the intersection of Black and Asian cultures. The department reached out to MixedSC, a registered student organization dedicated to the “multicultural and multiethnic community at USC,” seeking to collaborate on social media posts showcasing diverse perspectives.
Kiara Nguyen, a senior majoring in psychology and NGOs and social change and co-director of events at MixedSC, accepted the offer.
“I thought it was a cool opportunity to speak about my experiences, especially in light of recent events — the pandemic, [the Black Lives Matter movement],” Nguyen said.
Instead, she found herself the face of heated controversy. She recorded and posted several videos on the University’s Instagram story as part of an “Instagram takeover.” Two of her posts specifically caused controversy, including one where she stated that the term “Chinese New Year” is incorrect — which some interpreted as an attempt to erase the holiday’s Chinese origins. Another, taken at a MixedSC meeting Jan. 31, showed a slide projecting the word “Chinese” in “Chinese New Year” struck through in red and replaced with “Lunar.” 
“I misspoke,” Nguyen said. “What I was trying to explain was that Lunar New Year was an inclusive term. You wouldn’t say ‘Happy Chinese New Year’ to your non-Chinese Asian friends.”
Viewers also took issue with Nguyen, who is half Black and half Vietnamese, stating that lì xì — a colloquial name for red envelopes given out during the Lunar New Year, derived from Cantonese — was a Vietnamese term.
“In Vietnamese, it’s called lì xì,” Nguyen said. “That’s what I call it in Vietnamese, and what Vietnamese people call it.”
After she faced backlash over the post, Nguyen apologized and clarified under the University’s Instagram post that announced the takeover event.
“I want to be clear that if you are speaking to someone who is Chinese, calling it Chinese New Year would be correct,” she wrote. 
The post’s comment section, Nguyen’s personal social media and her email flooded with comments and messages ranging from constructive criticism to hate speech — which only intensified as clips of Nguyen’s posts spread to TikTok.
Gabby Jia, a USC alumna, said she and many others in her community found offense in Nguyen’s assertion that using the greeting, “Happy Chinese New Year,” is “incorrect,” and said the University should have more carefuly reviewed the content before posting.
“The @uscedu account has a huge number of people — people going to USC or not,” Jia said. “[It’s] always the partial responsibility of the school to review the things [Nguyen] is about to say, especially the exact words that … she is about to share. I understand there is freedom of speech, but the [University] should try and do something to avoid controversy.”
Peijean Ward, another USC alumna, said she understood Nguyen didn’t mean offense, but that, nonetheless, the statements “touched a lot of nerves.” 
Ward herself took issue with the University’s treatment of Asian culture as a “monolith.”
“If you were to do something about Lunar New Year … you can talk to people from different Asian cultures who celebrate Lunar New Year, rather than assume that, ‘Hey, if we just use the term “Lunar New Year,” we can catch everybody,’” Ward said.
A junior majoring in business administration and a MixedSC member who wished to remain anonymous for fear of harassment, said she attended the Jan. 31 meeting and said the slides presented on Nguyen’s Instagram takeover were “misconstrued.”
“What she meant to say was that ‘Lunar New Year’ is overall a more inclusive term,” the MixedSC member said. “[It’s] not just people of Chinese heritage [that] celebrate the new year. It’s also Vietnamese people, Korean people.”
The USC Chinese Students and Scholars Association started a Change.org petition Feb. 5 to “Readdress USC’s Inaccurate Annotation on Chinese New Year.” The petition, in addition to taking issue with Nguyen’s statements, stated that the red strike-through Nguyen used in the presentation was offensive in Chinese culture, and that the University disabled comments on their post to silence those who were “simply trying to reason with the original post.” The petition accumulated more than 3,800 signatures at the time of publication. CSSA did not respond to multiple requests for comment by the Daily Trojan. 
Nguyen received various racist, offensive and threatening messages in her inbox — which were obtained and confirmed by the Daily Trojan — calling her the n-word (and its Chinese equivalent), and other racist, derogatory names. Others discredited her for not appearing Asian, with one Twitter user accusing her of “talking about Asian culture without an Asian face.” 
An email Nguyen received Feb. 4 concluded with a threat, reading “I truly suggest you take responsibility for your mistakes and show a humble and acknowledged [sic] attitude; otherwise, you may be revenged by … me and others one day. Keep that in mind. You are now a hot target to our whole Chinese group from the whole world.”
Nguyen said she believes she would not have received the level of hate she did if she were not half Black.
“It’s always ‘Black people are playing the victim’ when they talk about injustices,” Nguyen said. “It’s been … frustrating to see people denying the fact that I’m being called slurs, and also denying my identity as an Asian woman. As a mixed-race person, I’ve had to deal with the invalidation so often — I’m tired at this point.”
The MixedSC member said she agreed “that [Nguyen] probably would not have received the same reaction” if Nguyen were not half Black.
“As a mixed person, you’re constantly being told that you’re not enough of one group,” the MixedSC member said. “And when she’s speaking on the Asian experience, of course people are going to look at her and they’re going to think, ‘You’re Black, what do you know about it?’”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan Feb. 8, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer Kyle Henley wrote that the University did “not intend to disrespect the Chinese community or its important holidays and traditions in any way,” though “some of the language used in the social media posts unintentionally fell short.”
In response to the CSSA petition’s claims on disabling comments, Henley said that the University turns off Instagram comments when “there are posts that violate Instagram community standards,” adding that the majority of comments “appeared to come from parties external to the university.”
Henley posted a statement on the @uscedu Instagram account Feb. 11, apologizing for “language … that was interpreted as disrespecting the Chinese community, which is an integral and dynamic part of the Trojan family.”
“We will absolutely work to do better going forward,” Henley wrote.
Henley also expressed regret that Nguyen “has been the target of harassment.”
“While it appears that much of this came from outside of our USC community, harassment is never appropriate and runs counter to USC’s core values,” Henley wrote.
Jia said she believes the University’s apology was insufficient, and that the University should “look [at] another side of the story, especially for the Chinese community.”
“It will be great if the [University] can have multiple people take over [its Instagram] stories, each one of them taking one short story like, ‘What is the tradition in my hometown?’” Jia said. “Something like that would be really respectable.”
Ward said she believes the controversy to be a learning opportunity for her and the community as a whole.
“I really hope this opens conversations and discussion,” Ward said. “I cannot even say I know absolutely everything about Chinese New Year, despite the fact that I grew up in this culture. I still learn about it from [other] people who celebrate … We just need to always be learning and listening to each other — that’s how it’s gonna get better.”

The other day, I changed my Netflix profile icon to one of Retsuko, the red panda from the Netflix television series “Aggretsuko.” I changed it because I recently finished watching the show, but mostly because I felt like the angry, screeching Retsuko was the best representation of my mood at the moment. 
If you’re not familiar with the Netflix Japanese anime series created by Rarecho, “Aggretsuko” is about a red panda named Retsuko who has a secret.
Although she appears as a good-natured, passive office lady on the outside, Retsuko actually turns into a sort of alter ego when she’s singing death metal karaoke, which is the only way she can effectively express her real feelings. (How I initially thought about it: Hannah Montana, but the red panda version.) 
The setting is modern Japanese society with a catch: All of the characters, like Retsuko, are animals. These animals have exaggerated traits and are almost caricature-like. They’re intended to represent real personalities, particularly those in the office. The “traits” of each animal consequently define the character. 
What I think is so appealing about “Aggretsuko” is how the show distills these real-life dynamics into adorable Sanrio characters. Their cuteness and humor simultaneously distances us from these characters, while still seriously recognizing the archetypes in our life they represent. 
Retsuko has two faces, literally. She has the pleasant, smiling face that shapes her treatment in the office and her aggressive, death metal makeup face reserved for her karaoke sessions.
Even if we’re not red pandas, I think we can all relate to having two different sides of ourselves. Unintentionally or not, there are also aspects of myself that I need to suppress to conform to socially accepted behaviors. 
Like Retsuko, I have a difficult time expressing honestly how I feel about certain things, and I tend to believe others don’t understand me. 
Commentators have viewed Retsuko as a feminist emblem, writing that Retsuko’s inability to let out her anger represents how society at large often expects women to hide their emotions; at the same time, men can freely express how they feel. 
Marley Crusch at The Dot and Line writes that “Aggretsuko” and its relatable depiction of rage taught her how important it was that she “reclaim” her own. 
In analyzing the show’s feminist themes, Crusch mentions that women supporting women frequently comes up throughout the series. Retsuko’s friendships with Gori and Washimi, two women who are higher-ups at the office, are heartening as they support her in all sorts of matters, from relationship problems to her workplace troubles. 
In addition to being iconic for women worldwide, “Aggretsuko” is also an apt reflection of Japanese corporate society, especially the cultural need to conform to expectations. For that reason, BBC labeled Retsuko as “Japan’s new working woman,” as her character resonated with many women for being two-sided, breaking the convention: simultaneously cute and angry. 
It’s funny that Retsuko often launches into angry tirades against individuals that irritate her by screaming her feelings through death metal. 
It’s also incredibly relatable — how many times have we just smiled in favor of social politeness when we’re seething with rage inside? Who doesn’t have that internal monologue that we often don’t get to say out loud? 
“Aggretsuko” is special because it’s so mundane. The scenarios feel deeply personal, even if they’re not universal. Unlike Retsuko, I don’t go out at night to sing death metal karaoke and unleash my rage. Yet, I think we all need an outlet for the emotions that we find difficult to express. We maintain different versions of ourselves to others. Like Retsuko, we might have to figure out how to navigate workplace bosses that might not like us. We might be afraid to show our “real” selves to others. 
Within the context of an anthropomorphic society, Retsuko represents the everygirl. “Aggretsuko” takes viewers through workplace politics, different romantic relationships and relatable situations. There’s a brief stint where Retsuko even becomes a Japanese pop idol, but all of her struggles are deeply rooted in ideas of visibility and invisibility. 
Even as Retsuko becomes an idol and struggles with a dangerous hater, rage is a central part. Retsuko wonders if she can withstand the rage of others when a side of herself doesn’t conform to their ideal image. 
At its heart, the show feels like it’s about peeling away the layers of yourself. You don’t need a microphone to scream and fully say what you feel. But, sometimes, we need to let that part of ourselves out.

When trying to articulate the feeling, sometimes I like to throw a cute “crippling” descriptor in front of my state of depression. Why not? It adds a nice touch, some pizazz, a quirky little glimmer. To me, the word fits snugly. Although, I wonder if it ever gets lost in translation with my friends who have never experienced depression.
I envision that these friends have created a mental picture of me sitting atop my six-week-old mountain of dirty clothes, fingers riddled with Takis dust as I watch Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl Halftime Performance … for the 500th time. 
Well, they’re not wrong.
When there’s reason to catastrophize, procrastinate or hunker down into a stale and dull reality, I’m certainly not above it. I have spent many days feeling like a pig in a blanket, lips parched from dehydration but too tired to care. I have let my hair grow greasy and my texts go unanswered, almost basking in my numbness. 
Most of the time, though, my depression is quiet, passive, mean little whispers. They don’t always obliterate me, even if I sometimes want them to. Instead, the whispers implore me to spend a few extra minutes laying in the bathtub. Harmless enough, right? Laying there, floating, I suddenly become acutely aware that the water is too hot and find myself grappling with a sense of looming existential dread. I skip my daily dose of Brazilian Bum Bum Cream, and my sunscreen goes untouched. I leave my water bottle empty on my desk, next to the medication bottle I ignore. 
During these times, my direct responsibilities seem like the only ones that are critical to my existence. Immediate survival in a stressful academic environment means compromise. Inevitably, my brain stops reminding me to do things that do not reap immediate dopamine or lift an urgent sense of panic.
I binge on the rush of posting on Instagram and power my brain with a $6 coffee. When I’m overwhelmed with maintaining a chaotic balance of attending school, work, meetings, clubs, eating three meals, taking my medication and — if I’m proactive — exercising, everything else falls to the wayside. Arguably, the important parts of life that make me feel balanced, fulfilled and happy fall to the wayside. I forget to find a new tree on campus to circumambulate, to figure out what cute little fairy sitting on a mushroom I want to embroider next or to actually relax in the bath. 
Sometimes though, between the cycles of feeling stuck in the reality of life and all its obligations, I find a gem — like when I chat with my other coworker, Rachel, about how our Pisces placements turn us into emotionally enlightened crybabies. 
It is during the most ordinary times I rediscover the easily overlooked but overwhelmingly beautiful details of life. It is during these seemingly mundane moments that I remember critical details about myself, which is strange because depression sometimes makes me forget who I am entirely. These little moments are the romance and the magic. When the sunshine hits my face just right, I imagine a symphony playing behind me.
My depression has not gone away. What has changed, though, is that my productivity, or my output for the day, what I was able to accomplish, is no longer the primary measurement for how I reward myself.
Just because I sometimes choose to spend a whole lot of time watching “Ask Wendy” compilations and eating Ben & Jerry’s Half Baked Ice Cream does not change how deserving I am of having nice moments with myself. I no longer feel guilty after being sucked into a state of avoidance. I’ve learned to be kind to myself, to pick up where I left off and sometimes even start the day indulging in the little pleasures that bring me joy. Every sliver of peace counts, regardless of whether I’m stuck on the first, fifth, or 50th step of my to-do list. 
I try to start small, with the basics: What I know will definitely make me feel better. I adjust my octopus plushie to a smiley or frowning face, depending on how I am feeling. I give myself permission, and sometimes force myself, to journal every day and write the affirmations, “I am beautiful, powerful, and capable,” as many times as I need. 
I do the work to rewire. I cry whenever I need to, and I hammock every Friday. And most importantly, I’ve learned when to cut depressive bath time short and whip out my Brazilian Bum Bum Cream because every day of existence deserves its own dollop of coconut ecstasy. I just wait for my verse in “Born This Way” by Lady Gaga: 
“I’m beautiful in my way /
Cause God makes no mistakes / 
I’m on the right track, baby, I was born this way.”

Neurons in our brains fire like shooting stars, and our personality is its meteor shower. 
I remember when I first took the Myers-Brigg Type Indicator personality assessment. Inspired by Jungian theories about personality types, the Briggs’ personality assessment concluded that I was an I.N.F.J. (Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, Judgment), or “Advocate” — which is apparently the rarest personality type of them all.
“People with this personality type look for depth and meaning in their relationships, preferring not to settle for a match that’s founded on anything less than true love.”
I audibly gasped. While I secretly felt special in that I was “rare,” I certainly didn’t want this trade off for my happily ever after. 
To this, a horoscope believer would say, “You’re such an Aquarius. You have an unrealistic, idealistic idea of what love looks like.”
However, in astrology and fortune telling, the Forer effect falsely persuades people their personality descriptions apply only to them. This phenomenon similarly takes place in the world of personality tests.
Personality assessments, such as the M.B.T.I., craft a narrative for you. Non-scientific type-based tests can create a fixed, tunnel-vision mindset in people and lead them to believe that they can’t change or improve themselves.
In a 2014 study that traced people’s goals for personality, 97% of participants said they were more conscientious. According to Roy Baumeister’s notion of “crystallization of discontent,” people tend to reshape their core values once they realize shortcomings in their lives.
According to Brian Little, a professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge and a fellow at the University’s Well-Being Institute, we can actually act against our biology and transcend seemingly set in stone personality traits, good or bad, especially if we pursue a “core life project.”
There is science to personality. The Big Five Personality test, a data-backed personality test, grades an individual on five basic traits — Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism — on a spectrum. However, wherever you score will change throughout your life. 
In AP Psychology, I was the only one who scored the highest in neuroticism. When I looked up the definition of “neuroticism,” I was met with words such as “anxiety,” “emotional instability” and “depression.” People who score high in neuroticism tend to feel dissatisfied with themselves and their lives. They tend to feel more negative emotions more intensely and neuroticism is often associated with a diminished quality of life. 
To say the least, it was an unpleasant read. From there on, I’d be lying if I said that my diagnosed “neuroticism” didn’t creep up on me whenever I received bad news.
Personality has a biological basis. The frontal lobe is home to our personality and twin studies have shown that personality can be half attributed to genetics and the other half to environmental influences.
I’ve changed, and my “neuroticism” is most certainly not a defining hallmark of my character.
Personality neuroscience is currently being studied through a data science lens. Founded in 2014, Faception specializes in revealing someone’s personality just by looking at their face. Founded in 2014, the facial personality profiling company says that personalities are affected by genes and our face is a reflection of our DNA. Additionally, NeuroColor is the world’s first and only personality assessment created from empirical data gathered from biological and neuroscience research used to enhance work performance in tech, business and healthcare.
Personality testing is a two-billion dollar industry, and its application to business is ever growing. While personality tests are used to improve teamwork and collaboration in the workplace, they can be divisive and articles such as “19 Absolute Worst Jobs for Introverts That Cause Burnout” have poor scientific validity. It is equivalent to getting your fortune told and following through with it for the rest of your life. 
Personality tests should be taken with a grain of salt and it should not dictate how you live your life.
It is impossible that 7.9 billion people can be classified into 16 personality types or even five personality traits on a spectrum. Personality is a beautiful spectrum that is far more nuanced and complex than what personality tests confine them to.
