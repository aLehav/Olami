The Trojans got back on the field for a long Tuesday practice, although the majority of players practicing weren’t the ones the Trojan faithful are used to seeing on game day.
With the injuries racking up for USC, it’s very likely that we will see more walk-ons on the field on Saturday against Utah.
Cody Kessler had the walk-on wide receivers stay after practice to throw around and further build chemistry.
“It doesn’t matter where you are on the depth chart, you are going to have to play in this game,” Kessler said. “I really wanted to work on getting our timing down.”
On Tuesday, when USC lined up their 11 offensive positions two-deep, seven of the 22 players were walk-ons, with only two scholarship wide receivers and three running backs.
An Injured Team 
USC received more bad news on Tuesday when walk-on sophomore running back Taylor Ross was carted off the field by paramedics after suffering a bad knee injury.
By the end of Tuesday’s practice, USC was down to 39 healthy players who participated in the Notre Dame game.
Injuries have plagued the team at all positions this season, especially at wide receiver. This was apparent on Saturday night against Notre Dame when walk-on redshirt freshman Robby Kolanz was a part of Kessler’s two-minute-drill to try to win the game in the fourth quarter.
Biletnikoff Award winner Marqise Lee remains day-to-day after not practicing on Tuesday.
“It’s been tough being injured,” Lee said. “It’s the first major injury of my career.”
No scholarship tight ends were available on Tuesday, as redshirt juniors Xavier Grimble and Randall Telfer and sophomore Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick all sat out with injuries. While Grimble and Telfer have both already been ruled out, Cope-Fitzpatrick remains day-to-day.
“It’s unfortunate, but we got to keep rolling,” Grimble said. “We got some guys to do do the job and get it done, so we need to coach them up and get healthy as soon as we can.”
For now, offensive coordinator Helton moved redshirt senior defensive end Kevin Greene to tight end, where he played a little during fall camp.
“We’re planning for all scenarios, and we’re going to work as hard as we can to put the best 11 out there on the field,” Helton said.
Orgeron also confirmed Tuesday that redshirt freshman offensive guard Jordan Simmons will be out for the season after suffering a knee injury.
Back to Fundamentals 
A big goal for USC this week is to clean up the 11 penalties that hurt them badly against Notre Dame.
“We have really been preaching fundamentals out here,” Helton said. “We are going to do a better job of doing that and bring the same fire that we have had for the past couple weeks.”
Junior offensive lineman Marcus Martin says that they have been working on keeping their hands inside rather than outside their opponent’s frame, which causes all the penalties.
“We are addressing the penalty problem and I feel that we are going to improve on that this week,” Orgeron said.
As for the ongoing kicking competition, special teams coordinator John Baxter will be holding competitive drills for the kickers throughout this week, and a decision will be made between him and Orgeron on Friday.
Reactions To Miami Sanctions
After the NCAA docked the University of Miami nine scholarships over three years for booster Nevin Shapiro’s involvement in providing benefits to Hurricane players, USC athletic director Pat Haden expressed his discontent with the verdict, almost three years after the NCAA took away 30 scholarships from the Trojans and banned them from postseason play for two years.
“We have always felt our penalties were too harsh,” Haden said. “This decision only bolsters that view.”
With the verdict, USC has officially lost more scholarships than Ohio State, Miami and Oregon combined.

Student-athletes are well-known and well-respected for their performance on the field, and occasionally commended for their academic achievement. But many have talents that even the most diehard of fans would not know about.

During the 2013 Under Armour All-American game, freshman safety Leon McQuay III was able to put one of his many talents on display for the main stage — but not his football skills. He was acknowledged for his participation on the field, but McQuay was also highly touted for producing a song -— “I Will,” featuring Florida rapper Infinite Skillz — that debuted during the game.
“I didn’t really know how to feel,” McQuay said modestly. “I was just like ‘Wow, my beat is really on TV.’”
McQuay says Corey Long, an ESPN reporter who knew of his musical abilities, approached him.
“He asked me if I wanted to make a beat for the Under Armour game and of course, I said yes,” McQuay said. “He hooked me up with a rapper, I went to Corey’s house because he had an in-home studio and I made the beat.”
As he awaited the approval of ESPN, McQuay said he was so excited that he did not really think about compensation at the time.
“ESPN didn’t pay me for having the beat aired during the game, but the song is on iTunes and I do make money off of that,” McQuay said.
McQuay began making music in his sophomore year of high school back in Seffner, Fla. His cousin recommended that he buy Free Studio, a beat-making software program. From then on, McQuay began researching how to use the software and started honing his craft.
He said his mother was supportive from the beginning, but his father was skeptical at first.
“My mom bought me the equipment and a lot of the different programs,” McQuay said. “But my dad took some convincing. He told me, ‘If you are going to do it, then you need to take it seriously.’”
Once McQuay’s father saw how much time and energy his son was dedicating to his newfound love, he encouraged him to make it official.
“My dad told me to make it a business before I got to college,” McQuay said.
McQuay listened to his old man and created LM3Beats (Leon McQuay III Beats), his own beat production company. LM3 Beats is a limited liability company, which is not considered a corporation. Instead, it’s a legal company that has elements of corporate structure. Because McQuay created LM3Beats during his senior year of high school, he is able to profit from any beats he produces under his company while at USC.
“I’m setting myself up for post-football,” McQuay said.
McQuay credits a pair of musical mentors for helping him get on track. While still in high school, McQuay visited the University of Michigan. There, he met JDK and Rey, the Michigan football music duo who gave McQuay advice on how to balance football, school and music.
“They inspired me,” McQuay said. “If they can do it, I know I can; they have a pretty big fan base.”
McQuay said he wanted to start by sharing his passion with the people closest to him — his teammates.
“I was nervous,” McQuay said. “I was like, ‘I hope they like it.’”
“Like it” was an understatement; his teammates were left in awe after the freshman revealed his musical talents at the annual rookie show during fall football camp at USC. Freshman wide receiver Steven Mitchell still vividly remembers the performance.
“He had the best rookie show, hands down,” Mitchell said. “He literally showed us the process of making a beat, step by step. He put all these small beats together and it came out to probably the best beat I have ever heard.”
Mitchell was not the only one who left with a lasting impression of McQuay’s talents. All-American junior wide receiver Marqise Lee said all the veteran players were impressed with how much talent the young freshman has.
“We were all sitting there shocked,” Lee said. “He started off with one simple beat and I was already impressed; he kept adding to it, and by the end we were all in there going crazy, dancing. Much respect!”
After sharing his talent, he was overwhelmed by his teammates’ support. Some players even surprised him with their freestyling skills.
“[Freshman wide receiver] Darreus Rogers and [freshman offensive lineman] Khaliel Rodgers are mainly the guys that will come over and freestyle over my beats,” McQuay said.
McQuay can easily be called a jack of all trades. Not only is he a musical genius in the making, but also one of the many athletes who takes the “student” portion of his title just as seriously.
After achieving a 4.7 GPA in high school, McQuay was named one of five finalists for the 2013 Watkins Award, given out by the National Alliance of African-American Athletes. The award is presented to student-athletes who demonstrate outstanding community leadership, football performance and academic achievement. McQuay is one of two current Trojans to qualify as a finalist, following in the footsteps of redshirt freshman offensive tackle Zach Banner, who did so in 2012.
But McQuay has forged his own path by being the only music industry major on the football team, and he wants to minor in technology. He was elated to hear that hip-hop artist Andre Young, better known as Dr. Dre, donated $35 million to create an Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation, and plans to apply for the program.
McQuay can boast a long list of accolades, but what’s most impressive is that he is one of the most humble, modest and poised young men at USC.
“I Will” by Infinite Skillz is available on iTunes.

The USC sideline is becoming more like a scene on ER every game, as an astounding number of players limp off the field.
Yet, the biggest problems are not physical, like knee injuries to junior wide receiver Marqise Lee and redshirt junior cornerback Anthony Brown. Mental errors by Lee and Brown are the ones that cost USC a win against Notre Dame, and these mistakes are the ones that have taken their toll this season, no matter who’s able to suit up for the Trojans.
The case freshest in our mind is the takeaway from South Bend. The Trojans were reduced to their third-string tight end, had lost Lee and freshman wideout Darreus Rogers mid-game, and at running back were without redshirt sophomore Tre Madden while freshman Justin Davis left in the third quarter. That being said, the offense still had plenty of chances to muster more than 10 points.
At the start of the second quarter, with USC deep into Notre Dame territory, Lee dropped a fade to the end zone from redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler that would have put USC up 14-7. Two plays later, junior kicker Andre Heidari shanked a 40-yard field goal wide to the right.
In the second half, when it became apparent Notre Dame’s offense would disappear with Andrew Hendrix in to replace injured quarterback Tommy Rees, USC’s young offensive line killed momentum. The line was called seven times in the second half for holding or a false start, either making it 1st and a mile for the struggling offense or making an already tricky third or fourth down conversion even more difficult.
“Every time, we had a first down … We shot ourselves in the foot,” Orgeron said.
On the Trojans’ final drive, Kessler and sophomore receiver Nelson Agholor carried USC 39 yards down the field into Notre Dame territory. On 3rd and 3 with just over a minute left, sophomore tight end Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick flinched and jumped offsides. What could have been a Silas Redd rush for a first down turned into eight yards to go and two more pass plays. Two incompletions later, USC’s defeat was sealed. The penalty was only five yards, but like most of USC’s 11 infractions on the night, it stopped the signs of life we did see from the Trojan offense.
Just like 2012, USC is in the bottom 25 nationally in racking up 64.4 penalty yards per game.
I’m not saying USC is the only team to commit penalties or mental errors. As the Trojans’ victory over Utah State showed, opponents are equally susceptible to game-costing gaffes. Still, these errors have not been caused by injuries, but rather brain freezes or blown coverage. Injuries are why USC’s offense didn’t have the firepower to put up 30 or 40 on the Fighting Irish; errors are why it couldn’t manage one more touchdown in the game’s final 37 minutes and 50 seconds.
In USC’s 38-31 win over Arizona two weeks ago, their 21-point lead evaporated thanks to USC’s cornerbacks and safeties simply losing track of their assigned receivers. By my count, Wildcats QB B.J. Denker threw up at least five desperation heaves off his back foot, and four were caught, two for touchdowns.
In the Trojans’ 62-41 loss to Arizona State, Sun Devils quarterback Taylor Kelly certainly benefitted from stellar offensive line play, as he was only sacked once by USC. But even when his protection broke down, he turned broken plays into long gains thanks to poor tackling.
There’s no antidote to solving these issues on the squad. Young players make mistakes, and seasoned veterans are prone to errors. My point, though, is that while injuries are making Orgeron and the coaching staff’s job very difficult, they can be overcome. The win over Arizona without Lee and Madden in the second half showed that.
But when you combine reduced opportunities with mistakes that squander what chances the Trojans do have, then you have a major problem.
Utah comes to town Saturday, and the Trojans will be missing Davis and starting redshirt junior tight ends Xavier Grimble and Randall Telfer, while Madden and Lee are questionable. The Trojans still have the talent to win, but in a matchup of Pac-12 teams looking for their second conference win, the team with fewer broken plays and erased gains will have the edge. Considering the roster depletion, it’s an edge USC has to seize.

USC’s men’s tennis team took home its first big wins of the fall season on Tuesday, capturing the singles and doubles crowns at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Southwest Regional Championships in Malibu, Calif.
Starting strong · Junior Yannick Hanfmann began his 2013-14 season by winning the ITA Southwest Regional Championships singles title. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
In his first tournament of the season, junior Yannick Hanfmann rolled through each round with ease. The Karlsruhe, Germany native, who was seeded second in the tournament, took down two opponents from Grand Canyon University, two opponents from UCLA and a player from UC Santa Barbara on his way to the finals, where he faced off against Pepperdine’s Alex Sarkissian.
Last year when the Trojans hosted the Waves during the regular season, Hanfmann defeated Sarkissian, 6-4, 6-4. In the championship match on Tuesday, Hanfmann emerged victorious again by a score of 6-3, 4-6, 6-0.
Hanfmann’s success is impressive considering this is his first tournament after recovering from a knee injury, but not entirely surprising. From 2012 to 2013, Hanfmann put together a 31-7 record and advanced to the Round of 16 in the NCAA Individual Championships in May.
“Yannick’s only had three or four full practices [this fall] but he’s been hitting a lot,” USC head coach Peter Smith said. “So he played lights-out when he had to.”
Junior Eric Johnson also represented the Trojans well by advancing to the semifinals, where he fell to UCLA’s Mackenzie McDonald. Senior Michael Grant and junior Roberto Quiroz fell in the Round of 16, while senior Ray Sarmiento, who entered the tournament as the top seed, withdrew in the third round with a foot injury.
Though Sarmiento was forced to pull out from the singles draw, he continued to compete in doubles with junior Roberto Quiroz. Despite Sarmiento’s injury, the duo made its way into the finals, where they faced off against another Trojan pair, junior Eric Johnson and sophomore Max de Vroome, guaranteeing a doubles title for USC.
Johnson and de Vroome defeated duos from Loyola Marymount, Arizona and UCSB as well as a pair of teammates in senior Michael Grant and freshman Robbie Bellamy to reach the finals, while Sarmiento and Quiroz took down teams from Arizona, UCSB, Pepperdine and UCLA.
In the championship match, which was moved from Pepperdine to USC’s Marks Tennis Stadium on Tuesday, fifth-seeded Johnson and de Vroome knocked off Quiroz and Sarmiento, 8-4.
“I thought today was pretty fun,” Sarmiento said. “It’s not every day you get to play against your teammates. There was some trash talking before the match, so that was kind of fun — too bad I couldn’t back it up.”
In the lighthearted match, Quiroz and Sarmiento showed flashes of brilliance, but Johnson and de Vroome remained more consistent throughout, allowing them to upset their higher-ranked teammates.
“They definitely played well and they deserved to win today,” Sarmiento said. “They didn’t miss a volley.”
This title gives Johnson his second straight ITA Regionals doubles championship, after taking home the trophy along with Hanfmann last year.
Smith said he considered putting Hanfmann and Johnson back together this fall, but Johnson and de Vroome’s success in the past prompted him to keep the duo together. In last year’s loss to Ohio State in the NCAA quarterfinals, they were the only squad to put a doubles point on the board.
“Max and [Eric] are something special,” Smith said.
The Trojans jump right back into action at the Clay Court Invite on Friday in Orlando, Fla.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate met Tuesday night to review budget allocations for the fall 2013 semester and hear presentations from directors of Program Board assemblies.
The fall budget, presented by USG Treasurer Kameron VanWoerkem, allocated more than $150,000 to USG-sponsored student organizations and funds.
The largest of the approved allocations was $67,000 for the Concerts Committee. The committee will use this money to hire artists and plan for USC’s announced Springfest in 2014.
Such budget increases are typical, as popular and expensive artists usually generate more student involvement, VanWoerkem said.
“This is not unfamiliar territory for us. Concerts are very expensive, but they give us the best possible opportunity for outreach and student involvement,” VanWoerkem said. “People ask on our Facebook group, ‘Bring Katy Perry’ or ‘Bring Kaskade,’ and in order to deliver these big name artists, we must budget accordingly.”
Other allocations went to USC’s Recreational Club Council, and various branches of USG’s Funding and Program Boards.
The Senate approved the allocations with a 12-1 vote. A breakdown of the fall 2013 budget can be found on USG’s website.
Prior to the vote on the budget, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly’s Executive Director Gloria Kim and Assistant Director Alison Chang gave a short presentation.
Among the events APASA has planned for the spring 2014 semester are tours of Asian American neighborhoods around Los Angeles.
“There is a great surrounding APA community in the USC area, and we want to expose students to this community,” Kim said.
APASA plans to increase its presence on campus by balancing events of cultural celebration with events that address contemporary social issues.
“In the past, APASA has veered more towards cultural events, but we also want to educate students about the APA community and APA issues,” Chang said.
APASA represents 25 percent of USC’s student body and oversees 22 student organizations. The assembly has sponsored several events this fall, including a welcome back barbecue, an assembly mixer, a night market and an upcoming winter formal.
“APAs are a very significant part of our campus … at USC. We don’t necessarily feel misrepresented, but we want to make sure that issues regarding the APA population are acknowledged,” Kim said.
The Community Affairs committee also presented at the meeting. Director Kandace London, accompanied by Assistant Directors Caroline Smith, Sarah Nuslein and Annie Park, updated USG on relevant issues.
Smith, the assistant director of sustainability, said she is concerned with the university’s attitude toward environmental issues, particularly recycling.
“We’re working on defining an environmental and social consciousness, so that when people come to USC, they can see [we] care about the environment,” Smith said.
USC, unlike other Pac-12 universities, does not have sponsored recycling bins on campus. Community Affairs plans on placing new recycling bins around the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
“We want this to be a pilot program. Hopefully this leads to more recycling bins around campus,” London said.
University officials, however, are concerned that the bins will not be cost-effective if implemented.
“We’ve been getting some pushback from university officials,” Smith said. “The trash bins are expensive, and they don’t have the USC logo. There’s also no conclusive proof they’d help increase sustainability. We’re working on getting student and faculty support.”
Community Affairs hopes to negotiate a plan that will install recycling bins by the start of the spring semester.

The USC Office for Parent Programs launched a new application for Trojan Family Weekend, which runs from Thursday to Sunday, in order to enhance families’ experiences and assist with campus navigation, scheduling and communication.
USC is the first university to launch this type of application, geared toward helping guide family members through their weekend activities.
“The app is a really great way, first for parents to see their schedule and take it with them,” said Tina Orkin, associate director of parent programs. “And second, for us to be able to — in real time — let them know updates and changes that are going on.”
The app comes equipped with a schedule tab, which lists all the events that parents can attend throughout the weekend and allows the user to tag their favorite events in order to create a customizable agenda.
“I think [the scheduling feature] will be the best because you can organize your whole day and the whole weekend,” said Natalie Mata, a sophomore majoring in global health. “Events are hard to keep track of.”
In addition to events, Trojans can also tag their favorite event locations and parking facilities in the locations tab, creating a compiled list labeled “My Locations.” Each of the locations included in the app integrates Google Maps for visualization.
The app also utilizes Twitter as a communication tool. A news feed gives users the most updated announcements from the Parent Programs’ Twitter page, even if the user does not have his or her own Twitter account.
The schedule section of the app will also be continually updated throughout the weekend as details of events or activities change and news stories on events are posted.
“This new technology places the latest information at the fingertips of our parents,” said Beth Saul, assistant dean of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development and Parent Programs.
But the Office for Parent Programs also anticipated that the feed will be a challenge for them to maintain over the weekend.
“For me, my challenge is actually getting the updates in. We’re busy running around campus,” said Michael Marchak, a resource worker in the Office for Parent Programs. “I hope that I get the chance to update what I actually need to update.”
The office has trained student workers to help with specific app challenges, such as providing live updates. With more than 150 programs during the weekend, workers said the extra help is necessary.
Another concern of the Office for Parent Programs is the app having technological issues.
“With anything electronic, there can be some challenges,” Orkin said. “Because it’s new, we know there can be some user issues, but we’re pretty ready for that.”
The company that created the app, Creative Productions, is also a major sponsor of the weekend and will be on site during Trojan Family Weekend to help with glitches and troubleshooting.
Creative Productions founder Deborah Castro and Board member Larry Castro are USC alumni and parents of a current USC student.
“They’re not only helpful because this is their area of expertise, but also because they had been through the process of the weekend,” Orkin said. “From personal experience, they were able to tell us what they wish they could have seen last year.”
Some students, however, said they don’t plan on downloading the app.
“My family is here to visit me and spend time with me, not run around and go to seminars or events or activities,” said Aarif Masani, a sophomore majoring in mathematics and economics. “Family Weekend is for the family.”
Others plan on giving the app a test run.
“It sounds great,” said Kimberly Knabel, a senior majoring in environmental studies and environmental engineering. “I think most USC parents would find it useful, especially for parents who are more technologically savvy.”
Research for the project began last May, and by June, Creative Productions and the Office for Parent Programs were working on the new idea.
The final application was officially launched in the beginning of October and is constantly changing to keep users up to date.
“The app is really cutting-edge,” Saul said. “USC is cutting-edge.”

This summer, the USC campus will host all competitive events for the 2014 Special Olympics Southern California Summer Games Invitational from June 6 to 8 including track and field, swimming, basketball, gymnastics and bocce, according to an email from Provost and Senior Vice President Elizabeth Garrett sent on Tuesday.
The next year, USC will join UCLA in co-hosting the 2015 Special Olympics, last held in the United States 16 years ago. Sixty-five hundred athletes, 500,000 spectators, 3,000 officials and 18,000 volunteers will join the Los Angeles population for the largest global organized sports and humanitarian event of 2015 from July 25 to Aug. 2. USC will host the track and field, basketball and swimming events.
“As the president of the University of Southern California, I want you to know how proud I am that USC and this city will host the 2015 Special Olympics,” USC President C. L. Max Nikias said, according to USC News. “For more than 43 years, the Special Olympics have been a shining symbol of the triumph of the human spirit.”
Founded in 1968, the Special Olympics gives opportunities to the disabled to compete in athletic events on a grand scale. The event also brings attention to the mentally disabled. Since its inception, the event has grown from a few hundred to more than 4 million athletes.
President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will serve as honorary co-chairs of the 2015 Special Olympics. California Gov. Jerry Brown and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti will be honorary hosts.
“Michelle and I are so honored to serve as co-chairs of this inspiring event. The Special Olympics honors a tradition that started more than 50 years ago … at Eunice Kennedy Shriver’s house. Today, that simple day camp has grown into one of the biggest sporting competitions in the world for people with intellectual disabilities,” Obama said in a video statement. “The athletes coming to these games represent the grit and determination that’s at the very root of the American spirit.”
A complete event calendar for the 2015 games will be published soon, according to Garrett. The 2015 World Games’ Opening Ceremonies will take place nearby the USC campus — at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum -—  on July 25, 2015. Closing Ceremonies will take place at Dodger Stadium.

The USChangeMovement, the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and Undergraduate Student Government came together to host an event on Tuesday titled “Think Tank: 21st Century Activism.” The students convened in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center ballroom to discuss the intersectionality of race, gender and class within various societal issues.
Serving the community · Students discussed how to develop solutions to policy, wellness, relationships and stereotypes on Tuesday. – Uracha Chaiyapinunt | Daily Trojan
Shana Redmond, a assistant professor of American studies and ethnicity, delivered the keynote address at the event. In her speech, Redmond emphasized the importance of forming coalitions within social movements in order to effect change in the face of injustice.
“So many of us become stalled because we have no idea how to best be that change we want to see in the world,” Redmond said. “Prepare and fight for a world that does not yet exist. It’s yours to make, it’s ours to make — so pick up the pieces of the past and move it forward. Change and make what doesn’t yet exist.”
Following the keynote speech, the audience was split into four groups to address issues in stereotypes, policy, wellness and dating, as well as suggestions to start resolving these problems in the local community. Topics that were brought up included housing bubbles, food injustice, hookup culture and problematic depictions of people of color in media.
Many students in attendance said the event raised their awareness to sensitive issues to which college students can relate.
“I think the most interesting thing I learned was the media portrayal of minorities relationship-wise, including hookup culture and how it relates to The Row,” said Briana Savage, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “We need to create a space with a positive dynamic that challenges norms and changes minds, otherwise these stereotypes are perpetuated.”
Reyna Harvey-Bell, a senior majoring in political science, said she felt her ideas did not fall on deaf ears.
“Tonight’s event was more than just eye-opening; it sparked a deeper interest in me to find out about what I can do to incite change in my area and any community I can encounter,” Harvey-Bell said.
Others were excited to meet students with similar interests to their own.
“My main takeaway is that there are people who want to change the cultural expectation of ignorance and privilege on this campus, and that there are events like this to bring us together,” said Andy Su, a junior majoring in astronautical engineering.

A team of USC researchers led by Paul Thompson, director of the USC Imaging Genetics Center, published  findings that Alzheimer’s patients are affected by the disease three years earlier than expected.
Their work, which was published in last week’s edition of The New England Journal of Medicine, goes into depth about carriers of the TREM2 gene variant, a genetic mutation that was linked to Alzheimer’s earlier this year. This edition of the journal, also included five other studies focusing on the TREM2 gene variant.
“You can study all kinds of factors like exercise, diet, medication and even stress. This study is a little different, where you search through your DNA and find spelling errors or mutations that increase your risk of Alzheimer’s,” Thompson said. Besides his role as director, Thompson is also a professor of neurology, psychiatry, radiology, engineering and ophthalmology, as well as an associate director of the Institute for Neuroimaging and Informatics.
The study’s co-authors include postdoctoral researcher Priya Rajagopalan and assistant professor Derrek Hibar of the USC Imaging Genetics Center, where a team of more than 30 researchers worked on the project. Thompson and his colleague Arthur Toga moved from UCLA to USC this fall, bringing the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging and their work on brain mapping and neuroimaging diseases such as Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia and depression, with them.
“We’ve been tracking the disease for some time and one question that we studied is what it is that slows Alzheimer’s, and what is it that speeds it up and if there’s anything we can do to resist the illness,” Thompson said.
The Imaging Genetics Center was specifically working on researching Alzheimer’s disease for 20 years before this breakthrough, Thompson said.
The TREM2 gene variant is a gene mutation carried by 1 percent of the population. By mapping the effects of genetic mutation with brain magnetic resonance imaging scans, the lab became the first to show how this Alzheimer’s risk factor affects a living human brain.
Through the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the study recruited 478 adults from North America, 100 of whom had Alzheimer’s disease, 221 who had mild cognitive impairment and 157 healthy elderly adults. The study showed a dramatic loss in brain tissue. In comparison to the less than 1 percent per year rate of healthy people, which is also offset by normal tissue generation from mental stimulation, the carriers of TREM2 lose about 3 percent of their brain tissue per year. Alzheimer’s occurs when approximately 10 percent of brain tissue has eroded.
Thompson clarified the benefits of the study. The discovery can significantly speed up drug trials. According to Thompson, if there is a new successful Alzheimer’s medication that needs drug trials, people won’t have to wait three to four years for the brain to degenerate, and the results will be more apparent.
“Also, it gives us a lot of understanding about what Alzheimer’s disease is,” Thompson said. “We used think that Alzheimer’s comes from senile plaques, building up in your brain, and basically clogging up your brain. That is certainly true, but the people carrying this risk gene have a problem with inflammation in their brain.”
This connection could aid in the development different kinds of anti-inflammatory treatments that might ameliorate the condition of patients suffering from Alzheimer’s, even though there still isn’t a cure.
Some students said they weren’t sure how the study could positively impact current Alzheimer’s patients.
“I understand that finding this gene mutation that causes the brain to degrade the brain faster is a breakthrough, but I don’t feel as though it is that helpful because there is currently no cure for Alzheimer’s,” said Tiffany Tse, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences.
Other students were optimistic about the results of the study.
“Even though there’s no way to eradicate it yet, I definitely think this is an optimistic step in the right direction that might eventually lead to greater onset prevention,” said Helen Chou, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience.
Many were impressed that USC was the first to make these discoveries.
“I think they discovered something important that could be used in innovative treatments for Alzheimer’s, and it’s that much more important because of how it’s one of the first research projects that has shown these results,” said Sandy Lin, a sophomore majoring in human biology.
Currently, Thompson’s team is working on ways of bettering the lives of Alzheimer’s patients.
“Things like staying fit and rigorous cardiovascular activity can protect the brain as we age, but what we want to know is, how much exercise?” he said. “Or can you achieve the results … through other forms of stimulation like education?”

Steven Spielberg appeared at the Arclight Hollywood multiplex Tuesday evening to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Cinerama Dome, one of the most recognizable cinematic landmarks in Los Angeles.
Genius loves company · Steven Spielberg (left) and George Lucas pose at a recent visit to USC’s campus. Spielberg was at the Arclight Hollywood to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Arclight Cinerama Dome. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The legendary director kicked off the festivities with a lively Q&A session, followed by a screening of his seminal swashbuckler Raiders of the Lost Ark, the action-adventure classic that introduced audiences to globetrotting archeologist Indiana Jones.
Spielberg reminisced about the difficulties he and George Lucas encountered while trying to convince studio executives to finance their $20 million homage to the Republic serial-adventures of the 1930s and 40s. “I’m not sure any of them had even seen a serial,” Spielberg said.
The film, a modern masterpiece despite the lingering aftertaste of 2008’s unnecessary Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, remains the purest distillation of its genre, forever embodied in the bullwhip-wielding, fedora-topped presence of Harrison Ford. Ford seems almost impossibly young and dashing in his first turn as Dr. Jones, blending bare-knuckled bravado with a bookish charm that seems appropriate given the character’s second home in academia. He’s also much more idealistic than many of today’s brooding antiheroes, with his noble “It belongs in a museum” mantra and apparent faith that the U.S. government actually intends to let his university study the ark after discovering its terrible power.
Spielberg praised Ford’s willingness to capture Indy’s rough-and-tumble physicality, revealing that the actor insisted on doing almost all of his own stunts. “He’s not a superhero, and Harrison understood that,” Spielberg said.
When Raiders of the Lost Ark received a special Imax release last year, it contained a blessed lack of technical tinkering, boasting only a painstakingly restored picture and a fully remastered soundtrack. The same held true for this screening. Though parts of the film look as though they could have been shot yesterday, there is no visible CGI or Star Wars Special Edition-style “enhancements,” unless, as Spielberg quipped, “George has gotten to it without me knowing,” Spielberg said.
The majority of the beautiful matte paintings and practical effects, especially the iconic opening sequence, have aged remarkably well. The violence, including decapitations and face-melting holy fire, still feels jarring given the film’s now laughable PG rating.
The rest of cast is uniformly excellent. Karen Allen exudes feisty nerve as Marion Ravenwood, a consummate foil the sequels would later struggle to match. Other acting highlights include John Rhys-Davies as the jocular Egyptian excavator Sallah, Paul Freeman as Indy’s unscrupulous archrival Belloq and Ronald Lacey as a ghoulish Gestapo interrogator.
The sold-out event, the first in a monthlong series of screenings, also marks the 61st anniversary of Cinerama technology, the widescreen process that projects 35 mm (an early version required three projectors running at once) and 70 mm films on gigantic, deeply curved screens. This format, a precursor to modern Imax, was used to inject a sense of immersive spectacle and realism into outsized epics such as How the West Was Won and The Greatest Story Ever Told.
Based on the geodesic dome concept developed by architect R. Buckminster Fuller, the Cinerama Dome remains a popular venue for event screenings, including the premieres of It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Star Trek IV: The Journey Home and, most recently, Edgar Wright’s apocalyptic pub-crawl comedy The World’s End.
So, will the Cinerama Dome be around to entertain moviegoers for another half-century? In the words of Dr. Jones himself: “It’s not the years, honey. It’s the mileage.”

Bars are an easy solution to a long week at work or school. Are bars the only option, though, for 20-somethings in a thriving urban center such as Los Angeles? Absolutely not. If you’re looking to unwind and meet people, give recreational sports leagues a try — the positives will outweigh any apprehension you might have about organized athletic exercise.
Picture this scenario: It’s finally the weekend and you want to do something fun with your friends. The four or five previous workdays took an eternity to end and now all you want to do is let loose and have a good time. If you’re over 21, this fun activity will most likely involve making the trek to a bar somewhere. Therein lies the problem: Your night turns into a scavenger hunt for a bar that is close to home (because who wants to pay expensive cab fares?) but still hip and full of attractive people like yourself.
As reported by the Los Angeles Times in a recent article, the lesbian, gay and transgender communities here in Los Angeles and in other major U.S. cities have turned to recreational sports leagues as a superior alternative to bar-hopping.
The article highlights the recent trend by focusing on Varsity Gay League, a group of people from all walks of life, who get together to play the sports they enjoy. Moreoever, it is a way to forge new friendships and meet new people.
Let’s take a moment to consider the possibilities. Would you rather become friends with someone you gyrate against at a sweaty dance club in West Hollywood or a stranger you meet at a seedy Silverlake watering hole, or would you prefer someone who is active and group-oriented? The answer seems pretty obvious. While bars and clubs are fine choices for a night out every once in a while, they can become an extremely monotonous social routine.
This is why recreational sports leagues have become an alternative to social dependency upon drinking. The Varsity Gay League, for example, was started in 2007 when a group of pals initiated a spur-of-the-moment game of capture the flag in the park after a night of bar-hopping. Strangers joined in the game once they noticed how much fun everyone was having and soon league founder Will Hackner was inspired to start VGL. In addition to dodgeball and kickball, VGL also offers beach volleyball, tennis, quidditch, an annual Beer Olympics competition and other sports.
Now, it might be that running around with men in tight athletic gear isn’t your preferred social outlet (don’t ask me, some people are weird). Hackner’s Varsity Gay League, despite its name, welcomes everyone, no matter your sexual orientation. Besides VGL, there are also many other recreational sports leagues that have different focuses and demographics.
Do you have a recurring fantasy of playing dodgeball for a good cause, like a philanthropic version of Vince Vaughn in the aptly titled film Dodgeball ? Look no further than the Eagle Rock Yacht Club, whose dodgeball events work with Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department to donate to various charities. Meetup.com is also a quick way to find people around you who are interested in the same activities. And Justice Basketball League is another organization dedicated to providing an alternative for people who want to socialize while exercising.
Some people are not interested in outdoor or sports-related activities. It’s important to remember that no one is asking you to suddenly become a sports fanatic. Instead, think of it this way: Your body will definitely benefit from the exercise, and it will also thank you for taking a break from sugary alcoholic drinks that only leave you hungover in the morning. Most recreational leagues are very light on the competition and instead place an emphasis upon camaraderie and having a good time with your teammates.
Aside from the obvious health benefits, there are practical reasons to join a recreational sports league as well. VGL, for example, is free to join. On the other hand, hitting up bar after bar will definitely make a dent in your wallet. Even if you’re the type of person who is attractive enough to have his or her drinks paid for, there is still the cover charge to consider. Looks can only get you so far.
And if the monetary drawbacks of relying on bars as a social medium are not enough to deter you, transportation is the dealbreaker. Especially in a city such as Los Angeles, a city in which various neighborhoods are spread far and wide, getting around is a sport in and of itself. Nobody wants to be stuck as the designated driver for the night. And the possibility of using public transportation is almost a laughable matter. Though it is a viable option for some areas, such as getting to Downtown, it ultimately is not the city’s strong suit.
But in light of these negatives, the friend-making (or romance-finding) possibilities of an activity-based social situation are much more promising than the limited environment of a bar. People usually go to bars with one thing on their minds, and it probably isn’t the over-priced drinks. If you’re actually seeking to find someone with whom you can carry a conversation that isn’t drowned out by loud music, your best bet is a sport or fun activity that requires teamwork and actual socialization, not just grinding and glugging. Plus, you can have a fun new way to exercise.
If you’re still not convinced that joining a recreational sports league is a better weekend option than drinking at a bar, think of the outfit logistics. Who can resist an excuse to wear athletic short shorts and knee-high socks? That’s right. Nobody.

I truly enjoyed this piece. Well done.
“Who can resist an excuse to wear athletic short shorts and knee-high socks? That’s right. Nobody.”
Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup.
This article is really informative. Title can describe each and everything! Yes, you are right sports can be socially beneficial for us through sports activities we can reduce differences between countries, and humanities..!!

You don’t have to be a practicing Christian or even religiously affiliated to enjoy gospel music at USC. The genre is one of the most vocally rich in music, as well as one of the most technically demanding. USC’s gospel choir group, Saved By Grace, is trying to make gospel music accessible to everyone with their Night of Inspirational Soulful Expression, or NOISE, which takes place at Ground Zero Performance Cafe tonight.
Making NOISE · Saved By Grace is USC’s only gospel choir. The organization provides students a place to embrace their religious identity as Christians as well as express that identity through gospel music.

Saved By Grace’s head director, Princeton Parker, said the event, now in its fifth year, started as a way to give his singers performance experience.
“The executive board of the choir at that time was looking for something to showcase talent of the students who were in the choir and the Trojan community members as well,” Parker said. “They were looking to add another event that wasn’t a huge concert … something different.”
Saved By Grace Gospel Choir is the only gospel choir at USC. Originally called the USC Gospel Choir, the group was founded in 1998. As a student organization, their purpose is to raise Christian awareness through worship and spiritual fellowship. The choir performs at several USC events such as Trojan Family Weekend, SChristian Connection and Black and Latino Symposium, in addition to performances at outside venues such as Second Missionary Baptist Church and Mount Mariah. Saved By Grace has also appeared on 102.3 KJLH to talk about their newly released singles “It Is Well” and “’Tis So Sweet,” which are available on iTunes and Amazon.
Everyone has that one student organization at USC they call their home away from home. Whether it’s the Greek system or an athletic team, USC strives to have something for everyone to join and connect with other students. With the Saved by Grace Gospel Choir, it’s no different.
“[Saved By Grace] is just a time to relax,” junior business administration major and president of Saved By Grace Erica Martin said in an interview. “It’s not just us singing. I mean, it’s what we do, [but] we’re more than that -— like a family. It provides a comfort away from all the stress [life] can bring.”
NOISE will not only feature Saved By Grace, but also individual performances from various choir members and guests.
“There are a few of other members that have performances aside from Saved By Grace … so it should be really exciting,” Martin said.
Though spreading the Gospel is the top priority for Saved By Grace, the choir hopes that through NOISE audiences will find something relatable.
“It’s about diversity,” Parker said. “We are so very open to interacting and fellowshipping with even those who don’t believe like we do. The concert will be kind of all gospel … but this event is about diversity. It’s about making sure everyone can come in and get something that speaks to them.”
Both Martin and Parker joined Saved by Grace because they believe in what the organization stands for. Martin said she has been able connect with people who held the same values through her role in Saved By Grace and that the group has defined her experience at USC.
“I love singing … so I knew I wanted to be apart of SBG or whatever I can find that was like this,” Martin said. “It’s kind of hard to find people that are like you, as far as believing in God and finding people who practice Christianity as heavily as I do. To be in an environment where people do believe like you do, like Princeton, who are so willing and they love God so much, it’s really comforting.”
Like Martin, Parker came to USC looking for that place he could find solace outside of the classroom. As someone who was raised in Los Angeles and had gone to church all his life, he was eager to find his place in a similar environment at USC.
“For every person who comes to campus, you look for that place that will become your new home. For me, that was gospel music,” Parker said. “The gospel choir was a huge part of my transition [as a spring admit]. They opened their arms to me and allowed me to learn and glean from them … [and] be a part of the community that was established before I even got there.“
Saved By Grace invites everyone to be a part of their community on Wednesday for a Night of Inspirational and Soulful Expression free of charge at Ground Zero from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m.
“There are so many different faces, races that are going to be onstage, different types of music,” Parker said. “But it’s all very inspirational and it’s all going to touch someone. You can definitely come and find something that’s just for you.”

The first British musical to receive a Tony Award for Best Musical is back.
Don’t cry for her · Evita, which enjoyed a West End revival in 2006 and a Broadway revival in 2012, follows the story of Eva Perón, the second wife of Argentine president Juan Perón. For the run at the Hollywood Pantages, the role of Eva will be played by Carolina Bowman (left). – Photo courtesy of Hollywood Pantages Archives
Evita was released as a rock opera concept album in 1976. The musical opened in 1978 in London’s West End and immediately went on to Broadway one year later. Madonna and Antonio Banderas starred in the film version of Evita released Jan. 10, 1997. Between revivals in both London and Broadway, the musical will now be celebrating its Los Angeles return at the Hollywood Pantages.
Evita takes place in Argentina and follows the charismatic character of Eva Perón, the second wife of Argentine president Juan Perón, on her journey as she transforms from a poor girl in the slums to the first lady in a presidential mansion. Following one of the most controversial heads of state at the time, Evita tells the tragic tale of Eva Perón’s life.
Josh Young plays the character of Che, who serves as the narrator and Greek chorus in the musical, leading the audience through the life of Eva Perón. Young has played similar roles in different productions throughout his life in the performing arts.
“It’s similar to Judas [from Jesus Christ Superstar], as both plays are written by the same person,” Young said. “Che is a narrator and he’s also part of the story, same as Judas. … I don’t know a lot of other shows who have the type of character who’s integral to the story in telling.”
“Don’t Cry for Me Argentina,” “Another Suitcase in Another Hall” and “High Flying, Adored” are just a few of theater’s iconic numbers. Young, however, holds a different song close to his heart.
“I love the song ‘And The Money Kept Rolling In,’” Young said. “It’s kind of where foundation takes hold. Everybody’s essentially singing and dancing to their heart’s content. It’s all about granting wishes, giving gifts.”
Though theater-goers might enjoy the songs and the musical itself, what often goes unseen is how there are always challenges when theater performers go on tour.
“The thing is that you have to leave your family and friends behind when you go on tour,” Young said. “It’s integral to the job. I had to leave my dog with my folks.”
Though this is Evita’s first time back on the West Coast in a while, Young can’t say the same. The young actor has performed and worked with composers at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego. Young is excited to be back in the beautiful state of California.
As an actor, Young seeks to inspire other aspiring actors or those looking to pursue a career in the performing arts. According to Young, the key to a strong performance lies within each performer.
“What you are is enough,” Young said. “All you need to bring to a part is your past experiences. You are enough.”
One of Young’s greatest inspirations from working in the  theater business is the new composers he meets along the way.
“I haven’t gotten the chance to do that in a while. It’s great because you can tell that sometimes one of those composers is going to be the next Broadway headliner. It’s great to sit in the room as they make little changes to their pieces, to know that one day kids could be using their songs for audition songs in college or in training.”
Young claims that Les Miserables was the show that helped him realize that theater was going to become his life, and that it was the thing that made him happy more than anything.
For aspiring theater actors, Young suggests caution.
“I would say to them: if there’s anything in the world that you enjoy doing that you can make money at, do that instead,” Young said. “But if you can’t see yourself doing anything else, anything’s possible. It’s a very difficult career. You need to take a look in the mirror and evaluate where you stand next to people and [the] industry as a whole. Ask other people questions of what they think before you go to try to go out there.”
Evita opens at the Hollywood Pantages today and will play until Nov. 10. Tickets start at $32.

We would like to clarify USC’s social events policy in light of recent news reports. The university has not changed any policies, but is strictly enforcing existing policies regarding parties on and near campus during school nights. We took this step together because we do not want students to get hurt.
While these policies are being strictly enforced, we will have time for an open and thorough conversation on the root problem of excessive drinking. All students, including the Greek leadership, and the university are committed to making the campus a safe and an enjoyable place to socialize.
Student government, Greek leadership and the administration are unified in our efforts to protect use students. In the coming weeks, we intend to host public forums to examine this challenge and move forward with long-term, comprehensive initiatives.

You’re walking down the street, or maybe having a meal alone. You don’t want to seem like a loner and there’s not really much else to look at, so you pull out your smartphone, jam headphones into your ears and settle in. You refresh your email, Facebook or Instagram, and then maybe scroll through the news or check out some new music. Or, maybe you’re one of those Candy Crush junkies who stays engrossed with your screen for hours, barely pausing to take in the surrounding scene. Either way, your smartphone becomes more important than the people and places around you.

We’re all guilty of it.
But some might feel a little more guilty than others, particularly those involved in a tragedy on a San Francisco Muni train last month. On Sept. 23, a man murdered a 20-year-old San Francisco State student on a crowded Muni train. The gunman wielded his .45-caliber pistol in plain view for several seconds before pulling the trigger. According to footage captured by a Muni security camera, the gunman raised and pointed the weapon and then dropped it back down to his side several times before firing at an apparently random target. The footage also revealed that the surrounding passengers were startlingly indifferent to the surrounding danger, and for only one reason: their smartphones.
The surrounding passengers appeared to be too absorbed with their smartphones to notice the impending gunfire. Many had headphones plugged into their ears, and all had their eyes glued to their individual screens. There was little human interaction to be seen as they remained immersed in their individual, digital worlds.
Not a single passenger noticed the gunman before finally hearing the gunshot. Not a single passenger reacted in time to save Justin Valdez from a random act of violence.
Which leaves us to wonder — if smartphones didn’t exist, would Valdez still be alive today? Would a passenger have noticed that a man was pointing a gun and reacted in time to stop the senseless act? Though we won’t ever know for sure, I have to believe that if the passengers were more aware of their surroundings, it would have made all of the difference.
We have become too dependent on our smartphones and other technological devices for entertainment and escape when left alone. It has become our first instinct to whip out our smartphones so that we don’t have to interact with others and don’t have to look like we’re awkwardly alone. We no longer have to be present in the physical situations our bodies reside in, escaping by pressing our noses up to our smartphone screens. We have become completely oblivious to the world around us.
Somehow, our phones and the content they present have become preferable to our immediate realities. Even if a group of people occupies the same physical space, their minds are elsewhere and their ability to recognize danger is remarkably diminished. Smartphone users must realize the dangerous capacity of this tendency and make an effort to increase their awareness. We have a responsibility to each other to ensure that horrible and pointless acts of violence such as this shooting are prevented in the future.
So the next time you walk through campus, leave your phone in your backpack. Open your eyes, take a second and take a look around you. Be really present where you actually are, and try to convert the time you spend looking at a screen to time observing the world around you.
You never know what you’re going to miss while your eyes and minds are elsewhere.
