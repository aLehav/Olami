After nearly a year in business, Envoy, a student-operated food delivery company at USC has continued to expand. What began as a Facebook page has evolved into an iOS App that now operates on two campuses.
The company has collaborated with Chipotle, Pizza Studio and Chick-fil-A, among other restaurants, to deliver their food to students. In order to have their food delivered, students simply download the app, order what food they would like and wait for student workers to deliver their food. The delivery workers have the same app as the customer, said Chad Massura, a sophomore majoring in business administration and co-founder of the company.
“They get all of the information of the order, they go to the restaurant,” he said. “They swipe with an Envoy-provided debit card. And then they bike, skateboard, drive, whatever they want to do, to the person that ordered.”
The deliverers, referred to by the company’s founders as “Envoys,” travel via skateboard, bike or car. The delivery fee is always $3, and students can also tip their Envoys.
The pay is commission-based for Envoys, who are independent contractors. Envoys can make up to $8 per order, according to Gabriel Quintela, a sophomore majoring in public relations and the chief operating officer of the company. Quintela said Envoys can also create a work schedule that complements their schedule.
“In terms of their hours, that’s also very flexible,” he said. “We allow them to go in and enter hours that they want to work.”
With the help of an engineering student, the Envoy founders created the website, envoy-now.com, and the app, EnvoyNow, which was released in late September. Envoy operates in the Los Angeles area as a Trojan-only company, as only those with a USC email address can deliver and order through the company.
“We only deliver within about a 1.2-mile radius around campus.” Quintela said.
Since the release of the app, the Envoy website only exists to give some background on the company and the founders, and provide a link to the app.
“Everything is done by the iPhone app that we have on the App Store,” Massura said. “We spent pretty much all this summer building that.”
A video on the company website shows Quintela dressed up as a pink gorilla passing out bananas to students in Leavey Library to promote Envoy.
“That was a goofy thing we did during finals because everyone is in Leavey not having a good time, not happy about their lives,” Massura said. “We tried to do something funny and liven up the place a little bit and get our name out there as well.”
Envoy has also started operating in the Midwest.  With the help of a friend, Anthony Zhang, a sophomore majoring in business administration and co-founder of Envoy, introduced EnvoyNow to the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The company now has 1,300 users and 45 employees between both campuses, according to the founders. Zhang teamed up with Ethan Claes, a student from Wisconsin, to bring it to the campus.
“We reached out to him and said, ‘Hey, we know you’d be really good at this — we have a really unique experience for you.’ Kind of gave him all the background, gave him the application, a couple of marketing strategies and kinda of just let him go from there,” said Nick Wang, a sophomore majoring in business administration and the CFO of Envoy.
Claes was in charge of recruiting Envoys locally in Madison and working with restaurants to collaborate with the company. Wang believed that this opportunity would be unique for Claes.
“We decided to have him be our first launch of a new campus, and we did that on the week of Halloween,” Massura said. “It’s been going awesomely, he absolutely killed it. We have a bunch of cool restaurants, we have a bunch of people signed up, a bunch of new customers, orders are going well.”
Next semester, the Envoy founders expect to create the app for Android. The leaders also plan to expand to University of Indiana and UCLA, according to Quintela. The leaders of the company are currently working on a new version of the app, Massura said.
“There’s going to be a lot of cool stuff in that new version of the app,” he said. “That’s going to have a lot of new features. It’s going to allow us to be on more campuses. It’s going to change the entire experience.”

The corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street has always been a busy intersection for USC students. During the day, in addition to being home to the United University Church, the area is frequented by food trucks and students walking to and from campus. This year, the spot has a new resident: Tommy’s Bike Repair, a bike repair service helped run by students, for students.

Developed by founder of DormBikes and a senior majoring in international relations, Micah Greenberg, Tommy’s Bike Repair offers students across-the-board bicycle repairs conveniently on campus. The shop, which resembles a plastic shed,  is also stocked with 200 different bicycle parts and sells accessories, including a wide variety of bike locks.
“With the University Village being shut down, we wanted there to be an option for students to repair their bikes and get accessories in order to keep an ongoing bike community on campus,” Greenberg said.
Greenberg mentioned that as a freshman, he and his peers didn’t have such an option. Though he rode his bike often, there wasn’t a place close to campus that provided high-quality, trustworthy bicycle repair services to students.
The repair shop sits on the property of the United University Church. Ninety percent of the funds made from repairs and sales go to sustaining the shop. This includes paying rent to the church for allowing the shop to operate on its property and supporting the lead mechanic who works at Tommy’s fulltime. The other 10 percent of income is donated to charity.
The program was only made possible after Greenberg reached out to former USC student and part-time bike mechanic Joshua Romero, who now acts as the fulltime manager and lead mechanic of Tommy’s. Romero is in charge of running the shop and does all repairs in-house. Additionally, the team has its own head of marketing, Samira Haikal, a junior majoring in business administration.
According to Greenberg, the most difficult task in getting the project off the ground was finding a physical location where the shop could be situated. But, after much scavenging on campus, the rewards that came with the project made the whole initiative worth it.
In terms of what’s to come for Greenberg, Haikal, Romero and Tommy’s at large, the team is considering the incorporation of a bike donation or resale program, due to the large number of USC graduates who need to let their bicycles go. Another idea includes partnering with local churches and youth groups to bring unwanted campus beach cruisers to local children in need.
“Providing resources for students through something they really need — while building relationships with the community and providing jobs — I think that’s a great whole package,” Haikal said.

The Thornton School of Music was ranked as the No. 3 music school by The Hollywood Reporter in its list of the top 25 music schools of 2014, published on Sunday.
The list included schools from around the world. The Julliard School in New York City topped the list at No. 1, followed by the Berklee College of Music in Boston.
“I think that rankings such as these are highly subjective,” Vice Dean of Division of Contemporary Music Christopher Sampson said. “The best school is the one that meets individual students’ needs, and I think we meet a lot students needs very well.”
The Thornton School of Music, whose notable alumni include composer David Newman and opera singer Marilyn Horne, is Los Angeles’ “oldest continuously operating cultural institution,” according to The Hollywood Reporter.
“I think that our alumni who are working in the profession influenced this opinion a great deal,” Sampson said. “Within the professional community you can find a lot of Thornton alumni.”
The 130-year-old school has given students the opportunity to study alongside professionals in the field, such as D.J.-producer Young Guru. Singer-songwriter Chaka Khan recently led a master class in which, “students began playing her hit ‘Tell Me Something Good,’ and she jumped up and sang with them,” Thornton Communications Manager Evan Calbi told The Hollywood Reporter.
Thornton offers more than 20 different programs including classical guitar, composition, music industry and popular music. Popular music is one of the school’s most selective programs. The program, which Sampson said is small by design, admitted only 8 percent of applicants last year.
“I think that the applicant pool is seeing the success of graduates coming out of Thornton,” Sampson said. “When they see that kind of success, that incentivizes them to want to apply to the school because they see we are clearly training students for the professional world,” Sampson said.
In the coming years, Thornton students will also be afforded the opportunity to work collaboratively with students in the Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation, launched earlier this year. Sampson said he is looking forward to the projects students will be able to create together.
“Because the Academy has such a cultural slant, it’s not just a business or technology degree. There’s definitely room for music and audio content, and our students are going to be highly sought after to collaborate,” Sampson said. “I’m looking forward to it and to see in what form it will be in. I think it’s up to students to drive that.”
In April, Thornton was also named the first official university affiliate of The GRAMMY Museum. The partnership allows Thornton to have access to the museum’s collection’s for a variety of their educational programs, including seminars, projects, marketing and other research programs.

While many students spend their four years of college doing a combination of studying and socializing, others enrolled in USC’s Naval ROTC, Army ROTC and Air Force ROTC training programs dedicate their educations to a different cause.
“I felt that there was something more out there for me my senior year of high school,” said Leon Sung, a senior majoring in kinesiology. “Being part of a team and working to accomplish something really appealed to me.”

Sung is currently a cadet training officer and is responsible for planning and organizing task conditioning standards for the cadets he supervises. As the task force north commander, he also works with students at California State University, Dominguez Hills, in planning programs for students there and at USC.
Eyobed Mesfun, a sophomore majoring in economics, however, joined the military program for entirely different reasons.
“I’ve always wanted to get into government and politics, either through the military or through the civilian world,” Mesfun said.
Students in NROTC and ROTC programs have workouts known as PT, or physical training, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings from 6:20 a.m. to 7:30 a.m.
The program also includes Friday labs after the workouts, when the cadets take part in leadership activities, including squad tactics and techniques to handle chaotic situations and remain calm.
“Right now I’m just focusing on learning as much as possible and figuring out exactly what I’m going to do and my role in the program,” Mesfun said.
Students in the program are also required to take a military science class every semester that varies from two to four units. Additionally, they are required to participate in a Leadership Development Exercise once a semester, which focuses on “building more mentally agile and adaptive leaders,” according to Sung. Other exercises include the Ranger Challenge, a skills competition for cadets.
“You also have the traditional ROTC extracurriculars, such as color guard — we protect the American flag and display it during football games,” Sung said.
According to Sung, the Army ROTC is the largest branch, with opportunities that include specialty schools, promotions and various duty locations.
“Across the organization, people truly are professionals,” Sung said. “We have one standard set of army values.”
Though those in the programs share the same values, students find their own niches in each branch. For example, according to Mesfun, students in the Air Force program are typically resigned to engineering.
“Most of the roles [the Air Force has] are support roles and they are not in the field conducting operations and tasks,” Mesfun said.
Mesfun himself was originally part of the Air Force program, but switched into the Army because he felt it was a better fit for him.
“I wanted to just have a more hands-on role in my military activity and my career,” he said. “I realized if I was going to be an Air Force officer I would be really limited in what I would be able to do in the field.”
As students get older, they acquire more responsibilities within the program. Seniors are responsible for helping to run the program.
“Sophomores and freshman are typically more like sponges, and they’re just there to absorb and learn,” Mesfun said.
Even though he has only been part of the Army program for two months now, Mesfun said that he felt welcomed by his fellow students.
“We’re all part of a pretty tight-knit group, and they welcomed me pretty quickly,” he said.
Though each branch is part of the military, the branches tend not to work together.
“Each program is designed to work completely independently from the other programs,” Sung said.
Many branches have started to work alongside each other, but it is difficult because of the different training standards in each branch.
Mesfun said he felt the different branches had different specializations.
“I feel like Army’s more focused on the physical aspect and well-roundedness while Air Force is more focused on managerial and logistics and background information to support everything,” he said.

When you are in a cooking slump, rather than succumb to the temptation of ordering takeout, recreate your favorite restaurant dishes using ingredients you already have on hand. To gain inspiration, I recommend incorporating subtle influences from different ethnic cuisines. This method gives you a basic flavor template to work with but enough flexibility to make changes based on personal preferences.
This week’s recipes provide the satisfaction of an Asian-inspired dinner without the greasiness and guilt of most fast food. Since you control the overall amount of sodium, spice and sweetness that goes into your meal, the end result is infinitely healthier than its premade counterpart.
My tofu and vegetable stir-fry is a back-pocket recipe that every college student can easily execute. The entire dish comes together in minutes and can be adapted using a variety of proteins and vegetables. To prevent soggy vegetables, get the oil super hot before starting the cooking process. While I serve the finished product with quinoa and peanut sauce, it would be just as delicious over a bed of brown rice or with a fried egg.
I developed the quinoa bowl recipe purely through experimentation. Though each component is tasty on its own, the luxurious peanut sauce binds them together into a cohesive whole. From now on, I plan to keep a batch of the sauce in my refrigerator at all times. A drizzle adds bold flavor to any meal (think fried rice, kale salad, sesame noodles), without being heavy or overpowering.
Once you try this recipe, you can apply the same technique using Italian or Middle Eastern flavors. All you need are a few key ingredients — grains, greens and protein — and smart condiments to transform a boring salad into something truly spectacular.
So, on those occasions when you lack the inspiration and energy to cook, let ingredients guide you. Remember that cooking is about instinct rather than precision, and the best recipes often emerge when you least expect them to. Through experimentation, you will develop a natural feel for cooking and discover creative flavor pairings that you never imagined before.
Tofu and Vegetable Stir-Fry 
• 1½ tablespoons vegetable or other neutral tasting oil
• 1 tablespoon finely diced ginger
• 1 medium garlic clove, minced
• 1 cup asparagus spears
• 1 cup white mushrooms, sliced ¼-inch thick
• 1 cup broccoli florets, from about half of a small head of broccoli
• 1 tablespoon soy sauce
• 1 cup firm tofu, pat dry and cut into cubes
Total: 15 min. Serves 2-3.
1. Heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. The oil should be very hot and steaming.
2. Add the ginger and minced garlic to the skillet and stir until slightly browned and fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add vegetables, stir to coat in oil and cook until the vegetables are tender, stirring frequently, about 3-4 minutes. Mix in soy sauce and tofu and cook until the tofu is warmed through and the vegetables have absorbed the soy sauce, about 2 more minutes. Remove the pan from the burner and serve.
Vegetarian Quinoa Bowl with Peanut Sauce 
• 1½ cups cooked quinoa
• Tofu and Vegetable Stir-Fry
• 1 cup mixed greens
• Sesame seeds, for sprinkling
For the peanut sauce:
• 2 tablespoons unsalted creamy peanut butter
• 1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar
• 1 tablespoon lemon juice
• 1 teaspoon soy sauce
• 1 teaspoon honey
• 1 tablespoon water
Total: 25 min. Serves 2.
1. To make the peanut sauce, whisk together all of the ingredients until smooth in a small bowl. If the mixture is too thick, add more water a few drops at a time until it reaches the desired consistency. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. The peanut sauce can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to a week.
2.To assemble, place ¾ cup quinoa in a bowl with 1 heaping cup of the tofu and vegetable stir-fry and ½ cup of mixed greens. Sprinkle with a pinch of sesame seeds and drizzle with about 2 tablespoons peanut sauce. Serve.

The slight rasp is the signature of the indie singer-songwriter. It betrays the vulnerability, restrained emotion and cracked resolve that makes its genre alluring and so relatable. It’s the sound that has identified some of our favorite artists today and the promising ones of tomorrow: Ed Sheeran, Hozier, Ben Howard, the list goes on. But first, there was Damien Rice.
He’s still got it · Forty-year-old singer Damien Rice shows that he has not lost his ability to blend signature vulnerability with affecting vocals. – Photo courtesy of Damien Rice
The Irish singer-songwriter released his first single, “The Blower’s Daughter,” in 2001 and has since been a cross-Atlantic success. His singles, EPs and LPs have captured an ever-popular introspection and vulnerability in the wake of love. He has sweetly hummed about breakups, his shortcomings and about the details he notices with eloquence, most notably in his violin-decorated repetition of “I can’t take my eyes off of you” in that single. He’s swoon-inducing. He can bring darkness, sultriness, airiness and fluffiness depending on the mood he sighs into his gentle compositions.
The 40-year-old is most often known for his simplicity, a shy acoustic guitar detailed with violin and his rich voice. On My Favourite Faded Fantasy, his third studio album in 12 years, Rice incorporates many of the elements that helped him establish credibility as a sentimental and emotive artist (specifically on “Colour Me In,” which sounds like the cousin of one of his former singles), and also introduces orchestral crescendos and a song structure in which there is a noticeable climax. Instead of keeping them short and sweet, Rice elongates his songs, after threatening to pass the 10-minute mark.
Rice winds up these longer tracks with the precision and delicacy of a spider as it spins its elaborate web: slowly, tightly and with the intent of ensnaring its subject. Each, too, takes time to unravel. Rice begins with soft allure, dropping deliberate pauses as the music builds, even tapering off into pregnant silence before resuming his spiral. It is with these delicately woven songs that Rice creates pseudo-novellas that smother the listener in a story, a mood, a moment and refuse to let them leave it.
“It Takes A Lot To Know A Man,” which clocks in at 9:33, epitomizes this. Four minutes into the song, Rice’s layered vocals abruptly hush into faded whispers and are left hovering until a crackling noise introduces a gentle and pained piano. The song transforms from ballad to instrumental waltz, one in which the bodies that would perform it would sway with elaborate flair.
The change of pace is refreshing for Rice, whose soft voice has always demonstrated a gentleness but whose intense passion and vocal flares communicate something lurking underneath the surface. On the title track, Rice bursts into a roar a minute from its conclusion with such vitality and alleviation that it feels therapeutic. On “My Favorite Faded Fantasy,” the shackles that Rice has used to restrain this hint of wildness are finally broken. His haunting, floating falsetto charts the course for the record with its stylistic departure.
“I got lost in your willingness to dream within a dream,” Rice simpers on the title track, lamenting his deep feelings for his former love, one he could replace with surrogates who will never be able to compensate for the connection he has lost. It’s a regret built on hypotheticals, of what could have been — “of what it all could be with you.”
Ironically, it is on the tracks that are the quietest, most textbook singer-songwriter balladry that Rice loses steam. The bareness of these tracks, accentuated with his layered vocals, does not lend itself to any particularly insightful message, or at least not in the same impactful way that Rice achieves on his other tracks. “Trusty and True,” the album’s penultimate song, is a dwindling, ambling eight-minute track that becomes tedious before it is fully realized.
The album, with its intensity and fire upfront, slinks as its progresses. The final songs offer a choral surge that feels benign compared to the tracks that preceded it. While the first songs communicated stinging yelps, pleas and implorations, Rice seems to concede, to sigh, to succumb. Even lyrically, Rice seems to get lazy, making awkwardly perfect rhymes (“trusty and true” with “lusty and lewd”) and repeating lines that are written almost like afterthoughts as though the repetition alone will help him believe they are true.
My Favourite Faded Fantasy is theatrical in many ways: composed of scenes that both exist as their own entities and as pieces of a larger puzzle. When Rice tests his own limitations, he succeeds in both surprising and delighting the listener with feeling that surpasses sentiment alone. The parts of it that dip and falter remove the listener from the story and allow them to drift away. Still, Rice demonstrates with this album that he will not settle for the routine and the stereotypes that his genre often lends him; instead, he will force you into his world and let you hover there, even if for just five minutes.

Best known for their song “Pumped Up Kicks,” Foster the People is still going strong. They are currently touring with French singer Soko and Sylvan Esso. All three will be coming to The Shrine, right next to USC, next Friday, Nov. 14. Being the only female and non-American on tour with the other male-only groups, Soko is the anomaly on this indie pop, folk and electro pop tour.
Starting young · Stéphanie Sokolinski, who performs as Soko, started playing the piano at the age of five to deal with the death of her father. Now 29, her talent and emotional touch are evident in her music. — Photo courtesy of bb gun press
Stéphanie Sokolinski, stage name Soko, hails from Bordeaux, France. She has only recently ventured into America’s entertainment and music industry. Touring with the immensely popular Foster the People has been quite the experience for the new musician.
“I had no idea [Foster the People] were so big and we would be playing such huge venues,” she said. “On the first show we played together, I wasn’t sure if I was going to throw up or faint on stage. It ended up going great and being an amazing tour, and definitely gave me a bit more confidence in my playing.”
Soko’s sound is a mixture of folk and indie rock. Her dreamlike voice can be compared to that of Lana Del Rey’s and classic French songstresses. Her previous songs have relied heavily on guitar, piano, tambourine and brass instruments. Her popular song “First Love Never Die,” which has more than 2.2 million hits on YouTube, is in a saturated faded color palette and draws upon the foggy memory of childhood.
Similar to her music video, Soko’s musical style evokes an upbeat tone. She calls upon her own childhood for inspiration and utilizes music as a cathartic experience. “so I make art out of all my dark thoughts and turn them into something more positive so I can accept situations, honor them, and move on from it,” Soko said. “Cut myself out of the world until I’m finally ready give birth to whatever was being my burden. Mostly fear of death, weird childhood memories. Guilt. All these fun things.”
The ability to turn the negativity into positivity is nothing new to Soko. At a young age, her father passed away and Soko used music and performing as an avenue to cope. She initially found acting as solace but eventually found her passion in music.
“I started playing piano at 5 years old when my father died … whatever could keep me busy so I won’t dwell in sadness … by then, I wanted to be a story teller at that age, in my head, it meant acting,” Soko said. “But around 20 years old, I got really bored with acting, and I had always been writing a lot but never took it seriously, and I started turning all my writing and dark thoughts into songs … and after I played my first show, it became completely vital and an actual goal and took over my life.”
This emotional method to her songwriting has resulted in a lyrical style that makes her unique to this tour lineup. Soko draws upon her own idiosyncrasies and individuality for an unforgettable, yet relatable set.
“Accept all my quirks but embrace them and [try] to shine a light on them,” Soko said. “I don’t want anything to be perfect, perfection is for monkeys. I like mistakes, I embrace weirdness.”
Though she has been passionate about music and acting her whole life, her seemingly natural ability did not equate into instant popularity.
“Man, It’s so hard. And you most likely won’t make any money” Soko said. “So, only do it if you’re 1,000,000 percent committed and if it’s completely vital for you.”
But Soko’s work ethic has also allowed her to achieve her early level of success.
“I’m a complete workaholic and control freak,” she said. “So ultimately, as much as I hate obstacles, this is what pushes me to better myself everyday and learn how to deal with life a little better. And even though disappearing and quitting sometimes seems like the easiest way out, pushing through definitely makes you stronger.”
Soko’s future plans involve music and acting — she shared that she plans to release a new album, My Dreams Dictate My Reality, in February 2015, and is booked as an actress in two movies for 2015.
When Soko performs at the Shrine with Foster the People, USC students should look forward to a night that differs from the usual house or rave music at this venue. Foster the People, Sylvan Esso and Soko represent a wide array of diverse musicalities and personalities that will entertain students. Soko herself said to expect “fun, tears, punk, white goths, aliens, weird dances.”

The USC men’s water polo team rebounded with two wins this past weekend following a home loss to UCLA the previous Sunday. The No. 3 Trojans (20-4, 5-2 MPSF) beat No. 4 Long Beach State in impressive fashion on Saturday by a final score of 13-7 and No. 12 UC Irvine 14-10 on Sunday.
Sonic youth · Freshman utility Mihajlo Milicevic added three goals this weekend to put his season total at 21. Milicevic hails from Belgrade, Serbia. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
It was a senior-dominated first frame Saturday against the 49ers (19-5, 5-2). As he did against UCLA, senior driver Rex Butler got the Trojans started against Long Beach State with the match’s first goal. Long Beach State would rally back to take a one-goal lead, but the advantage would not last long.
USC senior driver Marc Vonderweidt tied up the game moments after the Trojans lost the lead, and Butler added two more goals to give the Trojans a 4-2 advantage going into the second quarter.
In the second quarter, USC started right where they left off with a goal from freshman utility Mihajlo Milicevic. The Trojans then finished off a streak of six straight goals to extend the gap to 7-2. Though the 49ers would score once more, USC freshman utility James Walters picked up the last goal of the half and once again extended the Trojan lead to five.
In the second half, Long Beach State started on a 3-1 rally to close the lead to 9-6. Unfortunately for the 49ers, that run ended quickly. Freshman driver Matteo Morelli and senior driver Kostas Genidounias each scored before the end of the third to give the Trojans an 11-6 lead going into the final frame. Morelli and Butler scored their third and fifth goals of game, respectively, in the fourth frame and essentially put the match out of reach. Long Beach State added one goal at the very end of the game, but that would not stand in the way of a solid 13-7 road win for USC.
Sunday’s match against UC Irvine (13-11, 1-6) was not much different. The Trojans entered the second quarter with a 4-2 lead, but the Anteaters roared back to tie the game up at 4-4. Later in the second, Vonderweidt and Morelli each scored, but the Anteaters responded with a goal of their own. The 6-5 Trojan lead expanded to 8-5 by halftime with strikes from sophomore driver Nick Bell and freshman utility Bryce Hoerman.
Genidounias and Hoerman punched in goals to start the third, making it four unanswered goals for the Trojans and giving them a 10-5 lead. The Anteaters cut the lead to 10-6 at the end of the quarter, putting the game back in reach.
In what has become a trend, the Trojans stepped on the gas at the end of the game to secure victory. Hoerman completed a hat trick to extend USC’s lead to 14-8 with about a minute and a half to play. UCI scored two more goals in garbage time to put the score at 14-10 before the final buzzer.
USC’s play improved coming off of the UCLA loss, especially in the victory over Long Beach State. Trojans’ head coach Jovan Vavic believes the key to this improvement was mental.
“We emphasized that we really need to be much more focused,” Vavic said. “We need to be studying the opponent better.”
Though Bell had his first big showing offensively since a victory over LMU on Oct. 23, Vavic claims that the sophomore can do even better.
“It was nice to see him score,” Vavic said. “But Nick [Bell] can play better than he’s played the last couple of games.”
USC’s next matchup is a big one. This Saturday at 10:30 a.m. in Uytengsu Aquatics Center, the Trojans host No. 5 California. This season, USC has split its two matches with Cal, both of which were decided by a single goal. Cal won the third place game at the NorCal Tournament 11-10. Then in the SoCal Tournament championship, USC won 10-9. Vavic does not expect this matchup to be much different.
“I think it will be similar to that,” Vavic said. “This game means a lot to both teams. It’s gonna be which team is more prepared, which team is more focused, which team has a greater desire, but it’s going to be one of those great games. I think it will be a fun game to watch.”
Not only is the contest an interesting matchup, but it will also take place on USC’s senior day. A star-studded group of seniors in Genidounias, Butler, Vonderweidt and two-meter Max Hurst-Mendoza will be honored before the game. Vavic hopes his team will capitalize on the emotion of the day.
“I hope that the emotions are going to be positive and that we are going to be excited, that our players are gonna be hungry,” Vavic said. “I really liked the way we played against Long Beach State. The excitement and fire was there, so I really like that. I think we have so many players that add really great energy to our game. I expect it to be a very emotional and hard-fought game.”

Ed Orgeron wants to come back. After spending what felt like an eternity off the grid with his family in his Mandeville, Louisiana, home, the former interim head coach of USC football expressed to Bill Plaschke of the L.A. Times that he was open to the prospect of rejoining the Trojan family.
O-face · Ed Orgeron led USC to a 6-2 record, including an upset win over then-No. 5 Stanford, while serving as interim head coach in 2013. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
In a column that was absolutely worth all 1,760 words of reading, Plaschke described Orgeron’s chicken and Cajun boudin sausage gumbo in painstaking detail while recapping the beloved coach’s eight-game tenure as the gravelly voiced general of the USC football team. I’m sure most Trojan fans know by now: “Coach O,” as fans affectionately took to calling him, went 6-2 with an unforgettable win over Stanford, but two forgettable showings against USC’s two most important opponents.
In the interest of full disclosure, Bill Plaschke is one of the reasons I’m even writing about sports right now. My favorite Around the Horn analyst was also incredibly charitable to Orgeron in his piece. The possibility of Orgeron’s return sounds great on paper, but it’s difficult to envision a Trojan squad that would remain undivided after bringing back a former head coach. Installing Orgeron as an assistant, however, could prove far more beneficial than not. The former coach’s value as a potential recruiter and all-around chemistry builder is undeniable.
Italian Renaissance political philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli once pondered if it was better for a leader to be feared or loved. With a combination of Sarkisian and Orgeron, the USC coaching staff can be both. One of the main issues with Sarkisian’s players this semester has been a lack of discipline — USC’s aggressive play has come with a significant amount of penalties, many of the committed by the team’s youngest players.
The 2013 squad, largely under Orgeron, committed 6.8 penalties a game. This year’s team is committing 8.7 penalties per game, a full on two penalty-per-game increase. This is due in part to the younger players getting significant playing time, but also a general lack of discipline across the field. Orgeron’s fatherly persona off the field belies a disciplinarian approach in practices — something that can serve to reinforce Sarkisian’s current regime. But it’s not just the penalties: it’s the lack of emotion from the players this season. As coaching styles go, Sarkisian seems far more like Lane Kiffin than the emotional Orgeron.
This football team needs an emotional shot in the arm, it needs guidance at the underclassman level, and it needs stronger discipline. Ed Orgeron can bring those things and reinforce these concepts, and having Sarkisian and Orgeron bounce off each other as head coach and assistant will be the closest thing to piecing the old Pete Carroll era back together.
Plaschke’s column will reflect the sentiments of most of the Trojan faithful because, despite the losses to Notre Dame and UCLA, Orgeron captured the spirit and the heart of USC. No coach better encapsulated the feeling of unity and family, those all-important Trojan values that seem to fade slightly with each effort to improve the school’s U.S. News and & World Report ranking.
Last season was a magical ride, but there was something to it that was very real. That thinned-out Trojan roster played out of its mind, that’s what made the victory over Stanford so special. For the people who came out to that game, there was a feeling of real, collective solidarity. There were all classes represented, different nationalities, different majors, different student organizations, but one USC football team. Rushing the field was one of the truest manifestations of what it meant to be a part of the Trojan Family.
Pragmatists and pundits will point to any number of reasons as to why Orgeron shouldn’t be allowed back. The biggest bone to pick will be that Orgeron failed to beat Notre Dame or UCLA. I understand that part of being a Trojan is having high expectations. More important than that, though, is having high standards for ourselves in our respective fields of work — to represent this great university by playing our hearts out and buying into the concept of the Trojan Family.
To rephrase Machiavelli’s dilemma, is it more important for a coach to get his team to beat UCLA every year or to play the game like true Trojans? I’d argue that though both are nice, the latter is far more important. If there’s even a chance of bringing that passion and “one Team, one Heartbeat” mindset back to USC’s players, then Ed Orgeron is worth more than a look for an assistant coaching role.
Ed Orgeron told Plaschke that USC is his “family forever.” I couldn’t be more proud that he’s a part of it. Coach O’s coaching philosophy embodied one line from another prominent sportswriter, Grantland Rice:
“For when the One Great Scorer comes
To mark against your name,
He writes – not that you won or lost –
But How you played the Game.”

The Trojan football team might be entering the final stretch of its 2014 season, but it has its sights set for now on the California Golden Bears. USC is gearing up for its first game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in nearly a month, which will kick off this Thursday at 6 p.m.
Comeback trail · Redshirt junior fullback Soma Vainuku, who missed the past three games with injury, could see action on Thursday night after taking added reps in practice on Monday. Vainuku has six carries this season. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (6-3, 5-2 Pac-12) are coming off a bye week that allowed the team to earn some rest following two road games, which the team split.
Thursday thriller
This week’s tilt will be only the second non-Thanksgiving, non-bowl Thursday game played in the Coliseum’s history. In the first game of this kind last year, USC defeated Arizona 38-31. The Trojans are hoping for similar success this year against the Bears (5-4, 3-4).
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian said that the team is embracing the alternative schedule.
“We kind of get one more day of prep here tomorrow before our normal Friday routine,” the first-year head coach said. “We can really clean some things up, stay locked into the details of the game plan and be fresh and ready to go Thursday night.”
The Trojans did not practice last week, allowing multiple players to tend to their wounds following the team’s 44-17 victory at Washington State on Nov. 1. They got back on the field on Saturday to get a full five days of preparation in before taking on Cal, who is also coming off a bye week.
Though the Thursday night game might be disorienting to fans, senior linebacker and team co-captain Hayes Pullard said it hasn’t affected the team’s preparation.
“We really didn’t even remember the days we were playing on over the weekend,” Pullard said. “It’s just a chance to get better each and every day.”
Good Goff
Pullard and the rest of the Trojan defense will have to bring their “A” game on Thursday to defend the high-powered Cal offense. Led by sophomore quarterback Jared Goff, the Bears are third in the conference in total offense, averaging 509.1 yards per game, and second in scoring offense, averaging 41.9 points per game.
Goff, who has thrown 27 touchdowns and four interceptions this season, could take over the conference lead in passing yards following Washington State quarterback Connor Halliday’s season-ending leg injury.
Sophomore Su’a Cravens, who has transitioned from safety to linebacker this season, said the team is anticipating a touch matchup against a quarterback who shows so much confidence.
“We can see on film, there’s plays where he’s on the opposite hash and he’s throwing an out to the field,” Cravens said. “Not a lot of quarterbacks are comfortable with doing that, so he’s a great player.”
USC’s roster is already running low on numbers, but the secondary is especially depleted, so Cravens and his teammates will have to step up to slow down Goff. Following the suspension of senior cornerback-safety Josh Shaw at the beginning of the season, a number of young players have rotated at safety, one of whom is freshman John Plattenburg. Plattenburg was carted off the field following Sunday’s practice, and Sarkisian said he suffered a thigh contusion and his status is day-to-day.
Injury report
Cravens, who tweaked his knee against Washington State, was back at practice and said if the game were today, he’d be able to play.
Freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith, who left Sunday’s practice with something in his eye, was back at practice on Monday.
Sophomore safety Leon McQuay III, who collided with freshman cornerback-wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson against Washington State, showed what Sarkisian called a good range of motion in his shoulder.
Redshirt junior fullback Soma Vainuku participated in practice to a fuller extent than he has since he came back from a hamstring injury.

The  sleepy town of Westminster in central Massachusetts might soon become the first in the nation to ban the sale of tobacco products. Though ambitious, the effort is certainly admirable as the first step in a series of actions that could truly make a difference.

Policies in the past have succeeded in curbing rates of smoking, but this ban, if passed, will get to the root of it all — tobacco itself. Since a study by the U.S. Surgeon General determined that there was a causal relationship between excessive cigarette smoking and lung cancer in 1956, there’s been significant progress. According to the Surgeon General, smoking rates among adults and teens are less than half what they were in 1964. And yet, 42 million American adults and 3 million middle and high school students still smoke. To this day, smoking is linked to about one in five deaths annually, remaining the single largest cause of preventable disease and death in the United States.
So, though smoking in restaurants, workplaces and other public areas is often prohibited to protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke, laws need to shift to help smokers themselves quit and prevent the initiation of tobacco use. The proposed ban would do just that.
For those who need an extra push to start quitting, the measure would help trigger awareness and motivation. The urgency is definitely there.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, smoking is linked to stroke, coronary heart disease and 90 percent of lung cancer deaths. Those who smoke are about 25 times more likely to get lung cancer than people who do not smoke. Smoking can cause cancer almost anywhere in the body, from the liver to the colon.
Besides those numbers though, the emerging market appealing to youth poses another threat. With 69-cent bubblegum-flavored cigars and dissolvable smokeless tobacco that resembles Tic Tac candies, the industry needs to be stopped.
Small businesses will take a hit if the ban is passed, but if this fight against smoking plans to move forward, that’s inevitable. According to the Inquistr, store owner Brian Vincent, who claims that about 5 percent of sales comes from tobacco products, said, “It’s going to send business five minutes this way or five minutes that way — no one’s going to quit.” He started a petition against the ban and has collected more than 800 signatures.
Contrary to Vincent’s statement, business will be sent further than five minutes. Colleen Conner, a resident who signed Vincent’s petition, said that if the ban passed, she’d have to drive 25 miles north to New Hampshire to buy her cigarettes in bulk. The distance will pose an inconvenience that could discourage smokers. Yet, it might be difficult to imagine this ban will make an impact on smokers seeking a fix when flood waters or ice storms would be no match for addiction-driven will. But this is definitely a starting point. If other towns enact the same measure, the impact will be greater. In the event the measure passes, the stores could instead attract more customers — those who are interested in quitting and do not want to be tempted to fall back on the cigarettes for sale.
Others, like Conner, however, have pointed out that fundamental change has to happen as a personal choice. “When you’re a smoker, you’ll quit when you’re ready, not because someone told you to,” she told Boston.com. The ban might not make people stop, but it could serve as a wake-up call.
Hopefully, more towns will follow suit after Westminister because change needs to start somewhere. Even if it’s just one step that doesn’t seem to come to fruition, the ban will still prop the door open for more measures that will, together, be able to save lives.

Well a little history lesson is now needed I can see:
Look who first invented the Passive smoking Fraud
Hitler’s Anti-Tobacco Campaign 
One particularly vile individual, Karl Astel — upstanding president of Jena University, poisonous anti-Semite, euthanasia fanatic, SS officer, war criminal and tobacco-free Germany enthusiast — liked to walk up to smokers and tear cigarettes from their unsuspecting mouths. (He committed suicide when the war ended, more through disappointment than fear of hanging.) It comes as little surprise to discover that the phrase “passive smoking” (Passivrauchen) was coined not by contemporary American admen, but by Fritz Lickint, the author of the magisterial 1100-page Tabak und Organismus (“Tobacco and the Organism”), which was produced in collaboration with the German AntiTobacco League. 
That’s fine company are so called public health depts. keep with ehh!
History can shed so much lite on todays own movement it just amazes the mind………..
Hitler Youth had anti-smoking patrols all over Germany, outside movie houses and in entertainment areas, sports fields etc., and smoking was strictly forbidden to these millions of German youth growing up under Hitler.”

Calls for limiting tobacco sales have been commonplace in recent news, but a small town in central Massachusetts might take the national tobacco conversation to a whole new level. The 7,700-person town of Westminster could become the first town in the nation to implement a ban on all tobacco product sales within municipality and town limits.

Though the proposal to implement a total ban on the city’s tobacco sales is designed with the aim of improving health in the town, its enactment will only hurt local business and drive tobacco consumers to neighboring suppliers.
Under the proposal, made public Monday by the Westminster Board of Health, the draft regulations of the tobacco ban would ultimately prohibit the sale of any product containing tobacco or nicotine, including cigarettes, chewing tobacco and nicotine-laced electronic cigarettes. The plan has unsurprisingly garnered significant criticism from local business owners who argue that such a law would ultimately send their customers to nearby communities and threaten to drive their stores out of business. Several Westminster business owners have begun circulating petitions against the proposal. Store owner Brian Vincent’s has already accrued several hundred signatures.
The primary arguments in favor of the city-wide tobacco ban emphasize the importance of promoting healthy lifestyles, especially for the town’s young population. Though the goal is laudable on its face, it fails to acknowledge the fact that banning tobacco outright will not miraculously cure nicotine users of their dependency, nor effectively discourage buyers from purchasing products.
The fact of the matter is, in addition to a legal age limit prohibiting the selling of tobacco to minors, there are already state regulations in place which prohibit smoking in public areas — including the workplace, restaurants and bars. Some communities have even implemented smoking bans in public parks. Such laws, which restrict youth access to tobacco products and put an emphasis on public health and safety, are exactly what are needed to ensure that Westminster’s health concerns are met.
This proposal to ban the town’s tobacco sales, however, does not.
Though the ban would ultimately guarantee that Westminster’s citizens wouldn’t be able to purchase tobacco within its town lines, by no means does it stop customers from taking their business elsewhere. Banning tobacco outright doesn’t address the fundamental issue that nicotine dependency is more complicated than access to tobacco products. Tobacco is an inelastic commodity — consumers’ buying habits are not affected by price fluctuations. Thus, if it’s unavailable for purchase in Westminster, nicotine-addicted consumers will go beyond the small town’s limits and into neighboring communities. For some of Westminster’s small businesses, tobacco revenues total up to more than 5 percent of their sales — and that doesn’t even include the revenues made from the additional purchases tobacco-buyers make at these stores. Such a proposal won’t rid individuals of their dependency on the addictive drug, but rather only guarantees that Westminster’s small businesses lose out as their local customers are driven to neighboring competitors.
There are plenty of ways to ensure public health and promote healthier lifestyles for all of Westminster’s citizens, but an outright ban on tobacco will only cause more harm than good. Though Westminster’s Board of Health is concerned with the health of the townspeople, it needs to heed the concerns of business owners.
