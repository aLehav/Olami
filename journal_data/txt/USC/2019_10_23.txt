A Los Angeles-based parenting book author, who paid $35,000 to rig her son’s ACT score to try to gain him admission to USC, was sentenced to three weeks in prison in Boston federal court Wednesday.
Jane Buckingham, who also works as a marketing executive, was one of 33 parents named in an FBI investigation into a college admissions scheme that allowed wealthy parents to pay to falsify their children’s test scores and bribe athletic officials to get their children a spot at elite universities such as USC, Stanford and Yale universities. 
U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani also imposed a $40,000 fine. Buckingham will be placed on a year of supervised release after she serves her time. 
Buckingham pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to commit fraud and admitted to paying part of the agreed-upon $50,000 to Newport Beach consultant and scheme ringleader William “Rick” Singer, intending to have her ex-husband pay the remainder. 
Buckingham’s son was set to travel to Houston in July 2018, where a proctor hired by Singer would correct the boy’s answers after he completed the test. In a call transcribed in the investigation, Buckingham told Singer that her son could not fly because he had been diagnosed with tonsillitis. Singer and Buckingham worked out a plan for her son to take the test from home so that he would not suspect the scheme, while the proctor took it remotely. 
“I know this is craziness, I know it is,” Buckingham told Singer. “And then I need you to get him into USC, and then I need you to cure cancer and [make peace] in the Middle East.”
The exam taken on Buckingham’s son’s behalf received a 35 out of 36. In October 2018, Buckingham also talked with Singer about using the same scheme to fabricate her daughter’s ACT score. 
Eleven of 15 parents who pleaded not guilty to their involvement in the scandal in April were hit with a third indictment Tuesday. Actress Lori Loughlin, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli and nine other parents were charged with federal program bribery. 
Former Hot Pockets executive Michelle Janavs and former Pimco CEO Douglas Hodge, who bribed officials to have their children admitted to USC as false athletic recruits, pleaded guilty Monday to conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering for their participation in Operation Varsity Blues after federal judges threatened the third indictment.

USC ranks No. 9 among the best colleges for online doctoral programs, according to an SR Education Group report released earlier this month. 
The SR Education Group ranked 24 other institutions of higher education, including Johns Hopkins and New York universities. 
The group researched 1,943 online colleges to determine the nation’s best online schools, according to a press release. To be eligible for ranking, schools must have at least two online doctoral programs in a minimum of two subject fields and have an annual research expenditure greater than $0, according to the SR Education Group. Its website states that factors such as the number of full-time faculty members and student-to-faculty ratio played a role in the rankings.
USC offers three online doctoral programs between the Rossier School of Education and the School of Social Work: the doctor of education in educational leadership, doctor of social work and doctor of education in organizational change and leadership. 
“[We wanted to] increase access to our programs, to create programs other people around the country wouldn’t otherwise come to and then to also sort of expand our influence to become more known as a national leader,” said Robert Filback, professor of clinical education for the Organizational Change and Leadership online program. 
Filback said online doctoral students have access to all the resources that on-campus USC students have, including career centers and libraries. Rossier students use 2SC, an online learning platform similar to Blackboard, to turn in assignments and receive materials, and use video conferencing service Zoom to participate in live sessions. 
OCL student Natalie Nagthall said participating in the online program doesn’t necessarily take away from her experience as a doctoral student because she can still interact with other students and professors. 
“You felt like you were in an actual classroom, and you still develop relationships with your classmates just as you would if you were actually in a physical classroom,” she said. “I haven’t felt like I missed out on anything with the way this program has been designed, so that’s great.” 
Nagthall said she chose USC over other online doctoral programs at competing universities because of its reputation and structured schedule. While traditional online programs allow students to complete assignments based on their own progress and time, she said, USC’s online courses are taught at least once a week at a specific time. 
“I really liked how the program was set up to be a synchronous online program as opposed to a regular online program where you kind of check in whenever you can,” she said. “Because of my particular work schedule, it was really important that I find a program that was reputable, but was also a very synchronous program.”
Janice Andrade, another OCL student, explained that she decided to apply to and ultimately attend USC because it offered her a high-quality education without requiring her to always be in one location. 
“I chose the OCL online program because my husband and I were planning on moving,” she said. “I wanted to find a program where it allows me to be able to move if I needed to and still be able to make it to class. But also, I like the convenience of being in my own home and my office.” 
Since USC started offering online graduate degrees in 2009, Filback said the University has become a leader in highly-interactive programs. 
“[These programs] are equally demanding and rigorous — same curricula, the same faculty as our on-campus programs, and so we’ve been able to build on that experience,” he said.
Correction: The headline of this story was updated to correctly reflect that USC doctoral, not Ph.D., programs are offered online. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

For Los Angeles Football Club, this season has been one for the books, literally.
Not only did the team’s star forward Carlos Vela surpass the previous record for scores in a season with his 34-goal effort, but LAFC also set a new league record for most points in a season with 72. Beyond that, the club tied for the fewest losses in a season, matched the LA Galaxy’s record for most goals scored and achieved the best goal differential of all time.
LAFC has drawn a lot of buzz entering its second playoff run, with many fans curious to see how far its recent success on the field can take the club this time around. Last season (LAFC’s inaugural year), it was knocked out at home in the first round.
LAFC’s conference-best record earned the team a first-round bye and a bid in Thursday’s semifinal game against the crosstown rival LA Galaxy.
The rivalry between the Galaxy and LAFC is called “El Tráfico” — a name that refers to L.A.’s infamous traffic congestion. The excitement surrounding the game — especially given that it’s a semifinal — is only heightened due to the team’s short but intense rivalry.
The first matchup between the two teams warned all of us how unpredictable and exciting this rivalry could be. On March 31, 2018, LAFC gave up a 3-0 lead to lose 4-3 to the Galaxy — its first loss as a franchise. Since that first matchup, LAFC’s record against the Galaxy is 0-1-3.
While these past results favor the Galaxy, El Tráfico’s sixth iteration will be unlike any previous matchup between the two rivals. 
As in any sport, the playoffs are a whole different ball game. Rivalries, regular season records and past matchups can be forgotten. Every player knows that a loss means bidding farewell to the chance of hoisting the MLS Cup, and with the success LAFC has had this year, anything short of a championship would be disappointing to its fans and all those who watched the team dominate throughout the season.
This LAFC team has the ability to beat the Galaxy for the first time. It is important to note that the Galaxy’s only two wins against LAFC came at its home stadium, while Thursday night’s playoff matchup will be at LAFC’s Banc of California Stadium. 
It would also be naive to dismiss the passionate and undying support of LAFC’s fans. Given the stakes of Thursday’s game, playing at the Banc will be more important than ever. With the audible support of the 3252 and the rest of the stadium, LAFC will want the MLS Cup just as much as they do.
This game is not just a matchup of two Los Angeles teams but of the biggest stars in the MLS. Galaxy forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic is second in the league to Vela in scoring with 30 goals. 
Both Ibrahimovic and Vela are captains of their respective teams. Vela seems to have embraced this role more fully and to have used it more effectively as a true team player. Looking at their numbers, Vela has 15 assists while Ibrahimovic has 7. Beyond the pitch, Vela clearly understands the team aspect of the sport more than Ibrahimovic, who seems to put himself and his play on a high pedestal.
I am confident the Galaxy will not stop LAFC’s pursuit of the MLS Cup. The team’s home advantage, coupled with a healthy Vela, will help LAFC claim its first El Tráfico victory at the perfect time to bring it one step closer to a championship.

The No. 7 USC women’s soccer team is preparing for its final home games of the regular season against No. 18 Washington State and No. 12 Washington. 
The Trojans are coming off a disappointing 3-0 loss to Cal Friday in Berkeley. It was USC’s first loss to the Bears in two seasons and the first time the high-scoring Trojan offense has been shutout this season. 
Cal capitalized on virtually every opportunity from start to finish, scoring three times on 10 attempts.
The Trojans switched goalkeepers in the second half, as head coach Keidane McAlpine brought in former Pac-12 Keeper of the Year redshirt junior Kaylie Collins to replace sophomore Anna Smith. Collins saw her first action since suffering an injury in August and allowed two goals in the second half as Cal padded its lead on its way to the upset win. 
The Trojans have struggled this season on the road with an overtime win, an overtime tie and now a loss in six games away from McAlister Field. USC will be happy to be back at home where it has been dominant, outscoring opponents a combined 11-5.
“I didn’t think we matched the competitiveness they brought to the game,” McAlpine said in an interview with USC Athletics. “As such, they were able to capitalize on all the mistakes that we made.”
This has been a trend for the Trojans in games where they have fallen behind. No one doubts the Trojans’ talent and skill, but at times it seems as though USC’s competitive play takes a while to get going.
Sophomore forward Penelope Hocking said the loss to the Bears should kick the Trojans into high gear
“We’re not playing the best we can,” she said. “After the Cal loss, I think that was kind of a wake up call for us. We’re not there yet, we need to work on a lot of things to get where we want to be.”
USC will have the week to try to hit the reset button before facing two of the highest ranked teams in the Pac-12. Washington State ranks No. 4 and Washington comes in at No. 2 in the conference.
There are no cakewalks in the Pac-12 this season. It has been one of the tougher years in the conference’s history, with all but one team boasting a record over .500 and eight schools ranked in the Top 40 according to RPI rankings. 
The Trojans have won their last five matches against the Cougars and their last three against the Huskies, but the team’s focus is on the present. 
Hocking said it will be crucial for USC to approach the remainder of its schedule one game at a time instead of looking ahead to the playoffs. 
“For the rest of the season, we’re just really focused on each game,” Hocking said. “Taking each game one game at a time, and really focusing for the Washington State game.”
The race for the Pac-12 championship may be out of reach for the Trojans, who have two losses already in conference play and are looking up at a terrific Stanford team holding first place. Still, USC’s confidence in its future success has not wavered.
“I think we’re going to take it one game at a time and work on things we need to work on going into the postseason,” Hocking said. “We’ll be fine.” 
USC will look to get back to its winning ways as it takes on Washington State Thursday at McAlister Field for a 3 p.m. kickoff and Washington Sunday at 1 p.m.

USC football’s consistent injuries continue to provide lesser-known players the opportunity to prove themselves. Few have responded to this call to action better than sophomore linebacker Kana’i Mauga.
Mauga stepped in after sophomore Palaie Gaoteote IV sprained his ankle during the Trojans’ Week 7 matchup with Notre Dame. While Mauga had appeared in all of USC’s games to that point, he only played sparingly on special teams and at linebacker and registered just nine tackles.
In his starting debut Saturday against Arizona, however, Mauga racked up a career-high 13 tackles, a sack, a forced fumble and an interception.
When asked whether or not he expected the performance, Mauga replied, “Not at all.”
Mauga is a former four-star recruit out of Waianae High School in Waianae, Hawaii. The 6-foot-2-inch linebacker was highly recruited by most of the Pac-12 but committed to USC prior to the 2017 season.
“USC is a very special place,” Mauga said. “You ask anybody about USC and they’ll have a whole story about [it]. It’s really awesome being a part of this legacy.”
After enrolling in Spring 2018, Mauga played a limited role in the Trojans’ defense. Despite playing in all 12 games last season, he racked up just 14 tackles. Prior to Saturday’s game, Mauga continued to see limited action and was only brought in against specific offensive packages. Although his in-game action on defense was limited, Mauga was never discouraged. 
“It wasn’t too bad. I just had to wait my turn,” Mauga said. “So I just kept encouraging the other people in the front [of me], and I just waited for my turn.”
Mauga certainly made the most of his chance Saturday. Head coach Clay Helton had nothing but praise for Mauga after the breakout performance, comparing him to teammate senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. who, similar to Mauga, made his mark on special teams before his star turn.
“He reminds me a lot of what [Pittman] did when he was a young person — just a guy that we can count on day in and day out,” Helton said. “I remember that with [Pittman], he was waiting for his time, and meanwhile he was just being so special on our special teams and that’s what Kana’i has been — just a true teammate in doing whatever is called upon him to help the team win.” 
Redshirt sophomore outside linebacker Hunter Echols offered similar praise for his teammate.
“We love Kana’i,” Echols said. “[Kana’i] is a baller. He’s a beast … He works so hard … He’s putting himself in positions on the field to make plays, and I’m just so excited for that guy.” 
Echols was able to sum up Mauga’s playing style in a single word.
“Wild,” he said. “He’s everywhere: special teams, defense … Kana’i can do a lot of things. He’s just like a wildfire. He spreads everywhere — he’s everywhere.” 
Redshirt senior inside linebacker John Houston Jr. said Mauga fit in seamlessly not just on the field, but in the team’s preparatory process. Mauga credited his teammates and coaches for preparing him for his first start, especially the injured Gaoteote.
“[Gaoteote] has taught me a lot,” Mauga said. “He always tells me the rights from the wrongs. He always tells me that I have to drop a little more or that I have to read faster. He gives me tips here and there [as to] what I can do better.” 
Hawaii has a proud football tradition and has recently served as a deep pipeline of college football talent. Mauga is part of that tradition, and the potential impact he could have on young players back home is not lost on him. 
“Especially from where I grew up and where I came from, it’s not very privileged,” he said. “It takes a lot of hard work to make it out of there. I feel like [my play] gives them confidence, and that’s what they should get from this — that anything is possible through work.”

I was aimlessly scrolling through Twitter one day when I stumbled upon a tweet that spoke to me in a way no other tweet had before: “Why pay to go to a haunted house when smoking weed and going to the grocery store is free.”
Cannabis is known for its ability to heighten sensory perceptions, resulting in richer tastes and louder sounds which can potentially cause side effects of paranoia. While undesirable for many (and there are strains that can minimize feelings of anxiety), cannabis just might be the perfect boost for Halloween thrill-seekers. 
Although October’s festivities are often associated with parties and drinking, cannabis can be a great alternative for those who want to fully immerse themselves in the spooky vibes. Scares from haunted houses or people in costumes are enhanced when you’re high, making the experience more intense and exhilarating. 
So, I’ve compiled a list of tips and recommendations to make your Halloween a truly frightful and fun experience.
Edibles
Trick-or-treating and candy are staples of the scary season, and edibles are the perfect way to tap into this sweet Halloween tradition. Since edible dosage can be a bit complex and every edible has varying chemical compositions that produce different effects, it’s important to carefully measure out how much to take. 
I recommend NUG’s salted almond dark chocolate hybrid edibles which are perfect for going out. Ranging from $14 to $25 depending on the dispensary, these award-winning edibles have 16 servings at 6.25 mg of THC each, meaning that many users — especially beginners — should not take more than one. 
Although a common edible pitfall is the harsh cannabis aftertaste, the cocoa flavor of the chocolate overpowers any lingering hints of weed. Since cannabis binds to chocolate in a special way due to their similar properties, the high associated with these edibles is more gradual and thus more serene and enjoyable. 
Edibles often take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours to take effect, so be patient and take it slow. Everyone reacts to them differently — some friends have told me edibles have no effect on them at all. No, cannabis alone can’t kill you, but the overdose effects aren’t pleasant, either. Taking too many edibles can lead to “greening out,” causing feelings of greater impairment, distress, nausea and even vomiting.
Disposable Vapes
In the frenzy of events and outings, it can be hard to keep track of your belongings, especially if you’re under the influence and jumping from one place to the next. For Halloween, I recommend getting a vaporizer that you can easily part with, if necessary — or by accident. 
The Alpine disposable vape pen, which is tested and sold legally in the cool mint flavor comes ready for use. Pre-charged and filled with 300 mg of concentrate, equalling over 150 puffs, the pen is convenient, user-friendly and refreshing.
Discounts
Who doesn’t love a good sale? Chances are, your local weed shop is offering discounts on cannabis products with Halloween around the corner. The nearest shops to campus are LA Wonderland Marijuana Dispensary Recreational and New Age Care Center, with both only about two miles away. Potential deals are available either online or in person. 
Mixing alcohol with cannabis
If you’re planning on drinking during Halloween, it’s important to note that alcohol can intensify the side effects of cannabis, impairing you faster. Make sure to know your limits and have friends with you in case things go awry. Drink and smoke responsibly to enjoy your evening and ensure others do, too!
Designated driver
If you’re planning on going off campus for Halloween events, make sure you have a designated driver. While some people say cannabis doesn’t impair them while driving, it’s best — and safest — to avoid doing so altogether. Plus, it’s illegal. With campus safe rides offered by Lyft and Campus Cruiser, there’s no reason to drive! 
Smoking etiquette
If you want to have a good old-fashioned smoke session with your friends at a Halloween party, make sure to ask the people who live there if it’s OK. Practice good “stoner” etiquette and share some with them, remembering that the rule is “puff, puff, pass” with a strong emphasis on only two puffs! It’s best to smoke outside, so the smell can evaporate and people who have asthma or aren’t fans of cannabis can have some peace of mind. 
Smoke bag
Experienced smokers will tell you that they don’t go anywhere without their smoke bag — complete with gum, hand sanitizer, eye drops, perfume or cologne, a dab pen and, most importantly, a lighter. Nothing is worse than having weed to smoke and nothing to light it with, trust me. If you have room for a water bottle for cottonmouth and some snacks for munchies, that’s a plus. A prepped bag of practical items is sure to make your experience even better. You’ll thank me later. 
The end of October is a time of great fun, frights and food and enhancing that experience with cannabis is a surefire way to make the most of your Halloween scaries. Happy Halloweed!

Though country music can be typically associated with the South, Nick Valdman, a junior majoring in music industry, is a country singer, songwriter, producer and musician hailing from Seattle. Valdman, who goes by the stage name Nick West, had a passion for music since he started playing instruments at a young age, including the piano when he was only four years old. 
He immediately fell in love with music, and even though he grew up listening to a wide range of music, West was instantly drawn to country.
“When I was around 8 years old … my Aunt Rachael was driving me in her pick-up … and we were just blasting her favorite music from the radio on 100.7,” West said. “I just fell in love with it, and I just never stopped listening.”
While West has worked with artists of all genres, he knew he was going to be a country artist as soon as he started his career in music. He has also produced a wide variety of genres for fellow artists.
West recently produced “Act Nice,” a single by Nashville-based multi-genre artist and lifelong friend Analise Malick, which recently reached nearly 30,000 plays on Spotify. Being open to other styles of music allows West to share his talents with others and collaborate with artists in different genres.
West frequently works with singer-songwriter Lauryn Tauber, who he has known for a few years. They first met during the Nashville Maymester program, and as soon as they both realized they shared the same love for country music, they began to write together. When it comes to writing music, their process is different every time.
“We both write country music but when I think country music, I think him, whereas I tend to stray a little more pop,” Tauber said. “So I think that it’s really interesting especially because he has the pop performance program history whereas I don’t, he can come at things, and he just knows so much about music, and so sometimes he will come in with an idea of this or that, and he’ll come in, and he’ll kind of explain the reasoning, explain the influences, and he’s really great with chords and theory.”
West added that he has gone through a few programs in the Thornton School of Music, which has given him a different perspective of the music industry.
“When I met him, he was in the pop performance program as his major, and he is now a music industry major,” Tauber said. “He’s been able to really combine the performance aspect of things, as well as more production aspects or more business aspects.”
Though West mainly considers himself a country artist, he said he strives to incorporate pop, rock and R&B influences into his music. He said he tried to produce music in some of those genres in addition to country, but he stayed true to his roots with country music.
“Country music is just what I do,” West said. “It’s become so much more than just my identity as an artist but my identity as a person as well.”
According to West, as he writes his music, inspiration comes to him largely from personal life experiences. West said that from an early age, he believed he was born to be on stage, showcasing his musical abilities to crowds in every location — from backyards and bars to stages across the Northwest region in California and Nashville.
“At the end of the day, I make music because whether you record a really powerful song or you’re up on the stage giving an amazing performance, you know there’s people out there that are feeling what you’re feeling and vibing to it with you,” West said. “It’s the community aspect of music that makes me want to make it for the rest of my life.”
He said he continues to receive massive support from his mom, as well as his mentor Sharon. 
“Sharon is really the person who heard all of my songs first when I started writing because my good songs started coming when I was 16 because I got my heart broken for the first time,” West said.
West plans to move his career to Nashville after graduating from USC next year. He hopes to co-write, produce and possibly even touring in the next five years, all to build his audience in the South and even in the West Coast. He said he hopes to become like one of his favorite artists, Brett Young, who he feels has had similar experiences and upbringing as him.
“Brett Young. He’s from Orange County, and he actually married a girl from my hometown outside of Seattle, Wash.,” West said. “So he and I have a lot in common, and he’s an OC boy, a West Coast guy doing Nashville, and he’s just so big all over the country and even the world, and that’s kind of what I want to be.”
West’s self-produced debut EP, to be released next summer, will be available on all platforms, including Apple Music and Spotify, and will feature co-writes with fellow USC students and friends, such as Tauber, as well as a number of his classmates in Thornton. Until then, West will continue to release covers on YouTube, perform locally and at home and share the music he loves with more people.

An online petition that has more than 500 signatures is calling on University administration to address concerns of alleged discrimination against Black and brown students during a tailgate before the USC Homecoming Game Saturday. During the tailgate, National Panhellenic Council Greek organizations were surrounded by large wire fences. However, the Department of Public Safety and USC Alumni Association say the tailgate followed the same procedures as any other organization.
According to the Change.org petition, which was created by Marshall School of Business graduate student Nadine Isaacs, students felt that the tailgate had an increased police presence.
“Educated individuals simply seeking to be a part of the Trojan Homecoming experience were highly regulated by police officers and security,” the petition read. “We are tired of the blatant discrimination and demand the same respect afforded to other organizations on campus. This policing is unacceptable!”
A video on Twitter shows hundreds of people fenced into the tailgate with multiple officers surrounding the area. In the video, an officer can be seen monitoring the entry and exit points and slowly letting lines of people out through a small opening in the fence. In the video, an officer says, “Can we shut this down?”
Reggie Reed, a 2019 alumni Marshall alumnus, said he didn’t understand why the location was capped at 200 people, when it appeared there was space for more to enter. 
According to Patrick Auerbach, the associate senior vice president for alumni relations who helps plan the tailgate with the USC Alumni Association each year, the three organizations — Alpha Phi Alpha, Omega Phi Beta and Lambda Upsilon Lambda — were placed in the area at their graduate chapters’ request. Because of the area the organizations chose, they knew there would be a 200-person limit in the area, he said.  
Reed said he didn’t understand why the area was gated nor why the Los Angeles Police Department and Department of Public Safety officers capped the gated area.
“What it looks like to me this year they said, ‘Let’s put them all in a small area, and let’s put a capacity on that so we can tone it all down,’” he said. “That’s what it looks like whether they meant to make it like that or not … I feel like it should have been known, like, we can’t cage up Black and brown people. It just looks too strange.” 
In the past, Auerbach said the Alumni Association coordinated the tailgate with the undergraduate chapters of the organizations but worked with the graduate chapters this year to serve alcohol at the event. Because organizers wanted to serve alcohol, the wire fence went up as part of tailgate protocol, Auerbach said. While other organizations were surrounded by shorter white picket fences, Auerbach said the taller wire fences are raised for any organization serving alcohol, including the Latino Alumni Association, USC Associates and the USC reunion.
“All groups that were officially registered participants at USC Homecoming had the same parameters for the type of fencing … that they needed,” Auerbach said. 
Isaacs and other students said there had been more security surrounding the tailgate than other areas, but DPS Chief John Thomas said a fire official told officers to come to the area to deal with overcrowding as visitors tried to get in and out of the area. She also said one alumnus brought up concerns that the layout seemed discriminatory and requested a larger space several days before the tailgate, but his concerns were not addressed. The alumnus did not respond to a request for comment.
Isaacs said she, Reed and other attendees are drafting a letter requesting to meet with various officials including leaders in Student Affairs, Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development and the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs to understand what happened and discuss their issues with how the tailgate was handled. 
Auerbach said the Alumni Association debriefs each year after Homecoming to discuss ways to improve the event, including talking with the organizations about possible new locations in the future to accommodate more people. Thomas said students have not reached out to DPS about the issue, but he would like to meet with students and alumni to discuss what happened and explain the situation from an administrator’s perspective. 
“We can only enhance that experience by dialogue and getting the insights from the participants so that we can make the necessary adjustments not only to keep them safe but to enhance the experience,” he said.

Undergraduate Student Government proposed a joint resolution with Graduate Student Government that would allow select eateries on USC campuses to become authorized as CalFresh vendors during Tuesday’s Senate meeting. 
CalFresh is a federally mandated nutrition program that issues Electronic Benefit Transfer  cards for groceries to students who qualify. Student eligibility is contingent on whether they are approved for work-study or are Cal Grant recipients or members of the Educational Opportunity Program, which include low-income, first generation and historically underrepresented students. 
The resolution stated that “students across USC campuses exhibit a need for increased access to affordable food options.” It referenced a GSG-conducted study among students that revealed half of the 466 respondents don’t purchase food at on-campus eateries because they are too expensive.
USG President Trenton Stone praised the collaboration with GSG to address food insecurity on campus. 
“It’s something that is important for us both to work on and create spaces or services that support these basic needs of students,” Stone said. 
The resolution recommends creating a working group of representatives from USG, GSG, campus food retailers and USC staff to implement the program. The group would designate three food retailers that conform to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program standards, which dictate that an eligible store must have three stocking units of three different varieties for each staple food group on a continuous basis, like Seeds and Soto Cart, as pilot sites. 
The resolution also calls for a CalFresh matching program that doubles purchases dollar for dollar at the Trojan Farmers Market, meaning $10 worth of food would cost $5.
While other universities such as UC Berkeley and Oregon State University have implemented programs that make on-campus eateries EBT-accessible, matching programs have never been instituted before at universities, GSG Director of Diversity and Equity-Advocacy Quinn Anex-Ries said. 
GSG passed the resolution at a Senate meeting Monday, and USG will vote on the resolution next week. Anex-Ries applauded the resolution, especially the matching program.
“The idea behind [the matching program] is to structurally find ways for students to extend their resources,” Anex-Ries said.
Stone also presented a resolution in support of the Associate Students of the University of Utah Senate, which condemned the language used in its university’s motion to dismiss charges in a lawsuit filed by the parents of a deceased student. The ASUU deemed the language as victim blaming and dismissive of campus safety issues. The student, Lauren McCluskey, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend despite repeated reports of domestic abuse to University of Utah officials. 
Stone hopes the resolution garners awareness for issues of domestic violence and brings together student governments from different schools.
“We’re working together as student governments in the Pac-12, and also we are encouraging our own universities to just be aware of the circumstance,” Stone said. 
Sen. Christopher McMorran presented initiatives that he is working on, including the possibility of expanding Adobe Creative Cloud programs to all undergraduate students. 
McMorran also met with union representatives for housing and hospitality workers at USC to discuss the negotiations for their new contract with the University. The workers are pushing for higher wages, better hours and reformed retirement benefits. He will be presenting a resolution on student support for the union next Tuesday.

Donned in red, supporters of the menstrual movement rallied Saturday to recognize the inaugural National Period Day. The event, held in MacArthur Park, drew 40 attendees from throughout the Southern California community and was organized by USC students Kayla Adams, Athira Pratap and Faith Florez. 
Pratap, a junior majoring in neuroscience, and Florez and Adams, sophomores majoring in narrative studies and media arts and practice, respectively, were connected through PERIOD, an organization committed to spreading awareness of period poverty and the stigma around menstrual health. 
“The PERIOD organization’s mission is to address period poverty, and to address the stigma around periods in order to address that problem. Basically for those who don’t know what period poverty is, it’s the lack of access to menstrual products, particularly affecting different demographics,” Adams said. “Specifically, a lot of marginalized women don’t have access to these products, and so PERIOD’s mission is to be able to provide that at the different intersections of where they may be, whether that be schools, shelters and prisons as well.” 
PERIOD created National Period Day with the goal of having rallies in each of the 50 states organized by individuals in each state.
“When we found out that L.A. was not going to be having a National Period Day rally, me, Faith and Kayla decided to team up and give it our all to make it happen,” Pratap said. “We all just combined our ideas together and we started just working for it. We had a ton of support from the PERIOD organization, so we ended up becoming the organizers and it just took off like that.” 
However, the two students said organizing the rally was not easy. 
“I think the main problem was locking down the venue,” Pratap said. “We had to work with the city of L.A., and try to get that approved, and there were some problems until the last minute, but I think there are always going to be challenges with event organizing and planning.”
Despite these obstacles, the event created a space for those involved with the cause to connect with one another and gain inspiration.
“I think menstruation is a pretty stigmatized topic. It’s not really brought up among people regularly in conversation, and there are many menstruators who are struggling to address their period,” said Tina Wang, a junior at UC Riverside and president of UCR’s PERIOD chapter. “I think it’s just really important to support this day and bring awareness to those menstruators and provide them with the resources they need to support themselves while they’re menstruating.”
Yet, attendees were aware that the rally was in no way the final step on the road toward successfully destigmatizing menstrual health. 
“I think to help this [issue] is not just coming to a day like this,” said Xiaolin Li, chief development officer at Nannocare, an organization that creates menstrual products for women. “Whenever you have [period products] left that you don’t need, don’t waste them. Don’t throw them away, give them away. Somebody’s always gonna need it.
For Adams, her next goal is to make the USC community more aware of PERIOD and the issues it stands for. 
“You can only go so far … [with a rally],” Adams said. “I really want us to be able to be a recognized student organization at school and to start at the base level. I feel like there’s a really big disparity between USC and the outside community. There are a lot of initiatives, but being able to extend our efforts to the outside community, as far as menstrual products to the women in our community, in whatever capacity we can, could definitely be something that we would be interested in and should be doing.”
