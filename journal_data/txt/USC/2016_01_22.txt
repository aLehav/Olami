Arim Han | Daily Trojan
Over the long weekend I had the opportunity to drive up to Big Bear Lake and spend a few days there with some friends. We rented a cabin, played mafia and spent time enjoying the incredible view. Being up in the mountains is an entirely different setting compared to the hustle and bustle of downtown L.A., and at times it felt like I was on a different planet — no skyscrapers, no sirens every 30 seconds and no Wi-Fi. The peace of being in the mountains in a cabin overlooking a frozen lake was a refreshing way to relax after a crazy first week back at school. Have I convinced you to make the trip yet? Here are a few more reasons why you should drive up to experience the SoCal snow:

For anyone who calls themselves a Californian, there are certain songs and artists you have to know. Artists like 2Pac, Dr. Dre, Green Day and Guns N’ Roses are among the essentials. Their songs have defined a sound over the past 30 years or so, influencing many other great artists to refine and invent sounds of their own. While there are many known examples of great Californian artists, there are some who don’t always make top 10 lists or aren’t household names just yet.
One band in particular, Young the Giant, is one that deserves accolades.
A group that hails from Orange County, Young the Giant is starting to leave an imprint in various music circles while keeping a humble and almost overly chill demeanor. This indie band has made waves in the music scene over the years with their fresh and raw sound. Their self-titled album, Young the Giant, sounds exactly like  one would think of when the genre “indie rock” comes to mind.
Vocalist Sameer Gadhia’s vocals are the icing on top of the guitarists Jacob Tilley and Eric Cannata, whose sounds are never harsh enough to compromise the indie sound, but simultaneously have a clear bite to it. In addition, François Comtois demonstrates his appreciation for the cymbals on the majority of the songs on the album, while bassist Payam Doostzadeh keeps everything in the pocket with his groove. Notable songs from this album are “My Body,” “Apartment,” “I Got” and “Cough Syrup.”
The band’s second album, Mind Over Matter, is a bit more experimental than their last, but still retains their unique indie sound on several tracks. The song “Firelight” leans heavily toward the indie aspect of their sound while abandoning their harsher rock tones almost completely.
On the other hand, a song like “It’s About Time” does the exact opposite. Fans of alternative rock band The Neighbourhood would enjoy most of the songs on this album. Highlights from this album include “Teachers,” “Daydreamer” and my personal all-time favorite from the band, “Anagram.”
The X factor that Young the Giant has stems from how in-tune everyone is when they play together, and how youthful their sound is. Indie rock fans simply cannot avoid listening to this band, and every Californian should know them, because their name will be included among with the greats someday.
So whether you’re new to the state or born and raised, be sure to put Young the Giant in your California artist playlists.
This is the reason why I love indie Artist, they invent sounds of their own. So for California playlist it’s Young Giant and for Florida it’s Jasper Sawyer my newest favorite indie artist. I’m so glad to see Young Giant growing.

After a disappointing pair of losses in Washington, the Women of Troy will look ahead to a defining weekend at home. A set of wins against formidable California teams has the potential to give USC a boost into the top half of the Pac-12 rankings.  
The weekend starts off on Friday night with USC playing host to No. 12 Stanford, the Pac-12 team ranked second highest in the AP polls behind No. 8 Arizona State. The powerhouse team put out dominating performances against Utah and Arizona, cemented by junior guard Lili Thompson. Averaging 16.8 points a game — over a third of which came behind the 3-point line — Thompson creates a high-paced attack that the rest of her team works off of.
Despite a high ranking in the AP poll, Stanford is ranked just fourth in the conference due to an early loss to Arizona State. After narrowly besting Oregon 62-60, Stanford is also fresh off of a loss to Oregon State, where late-game shooting similarly allowed a comeback victory.
The weekend’s second game against Cal provides an easier opportunity for the Women of Troy to notch another conference win. At 1-5 in conference play, Cal is ranked eleventh in the Pac-12 and has struggled all season against their stacked conference. The team’s lone win comes against 0-6 Colorado, a team that has not come within 11 points of a win since their conference home openers against both Washington teams.
In order to pull out wins this weekend, USC will have to adapt from last weekend’s losses. Missing starters Jordan Adams and Brianna Barrett due to eligibility issues, USC struggled with shooting percentage, which fell to 32 percent in the second half of their 73-61 loss to Washington State. In both games, the team hit a cold patch of shooting in the third quarter, allowing leads to slip away and forcing the team into a more frenzied style of play in the fourth quarter.
A player to watch this weekend will be transfer graduate student Temi Fagbenle. Throughout this season, Fagbenle has become increasingly formidable in the post, leading the USC squad with 17.2 points and 12 rebounds per game against the Pac-12. It was Fagbenle who provided the necessary offensive spark to upset UCLA two weeks ago, when she led the team with 20 points and 15 rebounds.
Despite the weekend’s struggles in Washington, Fagbenle was still able to put up a combined total of 35 points and 29 rebounds between the two games. Her performance in the post was supported by another USC strength — creating turnovers. 
The Women of Troy led in the first half of the Washington game after forcing 13 turnovers in a single half. The team averages 10.3 steals per game, a number that puts them in the top 30 of stealing teams in the NCAA. This statistic reflects the focus of head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke’s methodology of play — attacking from the defense. It is a style of play that the Women of Troy will need to feed off of in order to win this weekend and secure a top spot in the Pac-12.

The No. 21 USC men’s basketball team could not overcome a double-digit second-half deficit as they fell 89-81 on the road in Oregon to the Ducks Thursday night.
USC came into the game riding an impressive 15-3 record and their first appearance in the national poll since 2008.
They were able to rest up following an eight-day break after dominating UCLA, but it did not seem to pay off with many fouls, turnovers and a 3-point shooting percentage of under 29 percent. Oregon continues its strong season, improving to 4-2 in the Pac-12 and tying the Trojans for second in the Pac-12.
Neither team could put together a run as the second half began, with the Men of Troy unable to close the gap and the Ducks unable to pull away.
Oregon jumped out to another nine-point lead at the 13:56 mark of the second half following a Chimeze Metu offensive foul and a Katin Reinhardt turnover. After a USC timeout, Oregon went on a 7-1 run to extend its lead to 71-56.
The Trojans were unable to mount a strong comeback in the second half but continued keeping it just close enough to keep everyone interested. Julian Jacobs’ two free throws with just under seven minutes left, followed by standout freshman Bennie Boatwright scoring two of his 23 points cut the lead down to eight at 74-66. Their effort was not enough, though, with the Trojans unable to make key shots and defend down the stretch and ended up taking an 8-point defeat.
Jordan McLaughlin has been a key player this year but had a disappointing game with just three points on one-of-five shooting. Boatwright had another great game, with 12 rebounds to go with his 23 points. Jacobs also performed well, scoring 18 points, grabbing six rebounds and dishing out five assists.
The overall team effort was not there in the end, with late turnovers, fouls and a couple of goaltending calls costing them dearly. It was a stark contrast to the start of the game, as the Trojans started out hot but could not maintain the pace.
USC jumped out to a quick 10-4 lead after threes by Katin Reinhardt and standout freshman Bennie Boatwright. The exciting start continued for both teams, with 20 points being scored in under three minutes to begin the game. Oregon battled back to even the game at 12 after a couple of USC misses. The teams traded baskets until the score was still locked up at 21, when Elijah Stewart broke the tie with an emphatic dunk.
The Trojans controlled the game until Oregon took its first lead of the game at 27-26 with a dunk at just under the nine-minute mark in the first half, to which the Men of Troy countered with a Boatwright jumper.
Oregon heated up shooting, and, coupled with several USC misses took a 36-30 lead before coach Andy Enfield called a timeout. USC responded quickly with a three-pointer by McLaughlin and a dunk by junior Jacobs. Oregon jumped out to a 9-point lead thanks to 3-pointers by forward Dwayne Benjamin. USC was able to get a few points back and headed to the locker room at halftime, down 46-41.
USC looks to rebound when they travel down the road to play Oregon State this Sunday at noon. The Beavers were one of the Trojans’ three conference wins last year, so this much improved team will look to repeat that success.
Oregon State has been disappointing with a 2-4 record so far in conference play, but boasts a strong 9-2 non-conference record, so it will not be an easy matchup. They are led by Gary Payton II — son of former Seattle Supersonic Gary Payton — who is averaging 17 points, eight rebounds and five assists per game.
USC will look to finish even on the road trip before coming back to Galen Center next week to play Washington State and Washington. The Trojans still have 12 conference games remaining, and while they will likely lose their spot in the Top 25 with the loss on Thursday, they have plenty of opportunities to climb back up the rankings.
