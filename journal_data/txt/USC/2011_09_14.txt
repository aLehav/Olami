Faculty teaching lower division classes assume students will spend more time doing homework than those teaching upper division ones, according to a recent study by ESM Chaperone, a research firm specializing in higher-education finance.
Fifty-nine percent of lower division faculty in the country assumes students do work outside of class for 15 or more total hours a week, while 51.7 percent of upper division faculty expects students to study the same amount.
The data also used information from the National Survey of Student Engagement and the Faculty Survey of Student Engagement, which collected data from the 2008-2009 to 2010-2011 school years.
Mark Thompson, USC professor of chemistry who has taught both upper and lower division classes, said upper division classes seem to have less work because the work requires more thought.
“In lower division classes, a lot of this is giving you a basic groundwork that you’re going to build on in upper division classes,” Thompson said. “The kinds of studying and the kinds of homework you do in an upper division class are very different. We don’t tend to assign 50 problems. We tend to assign fewer problems that require that you think about them more deeply and spend more time on them.”
He said lower division classes must lay a basic groundwork so students can succeed in upper division classes.
“It’s a different style of homework that you have as a junior or a senior,” Thompson. “[It’s] more contemplative and [requires] a deeper sort of understanding that you’re looking for in an upper division class.”
Sarah Francis, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said students’ work is more intense in upper division classes.
“Upper division classes are smaller than lower division, so there is more pressure to do well,” Francis said. “There are bigger papers, a more steady focus and an increased motivation to do well.”
Helena Seli, USC assistant professor of clinical education, said students should pay more attention to knowledge upon which they will build, like that taught in lower division classes.
“If there [are] no long term consequences of not acquiring that extra knowledge outside of class, that has less of an impact,” Seli said. “If you’re doing that in your major classes, where you are constantly building on that knowledge and hoping to graduate not as an expert, but [you are] certainly very educated in an area of study.”
Many students said advanced classes require more thought but not more time. Angela Asistio, a senior majoring in political science, said students have to utilize more knowledge in upper division classes, but that knowledge has already been acquired in lower division classes.
“You have more things on your plate,” Asisto said. “Foundation basics are established in lower division. In upper division, they’re just regurgitated.”
Sandra Kaplan, USC professor of clinical education, primarily teaches upper division classes. She said upper division students are expected to be self-starters.
“You’re supposed to grow more independent,” Kaplan said. “The real goal of you being here and going through all these levels is that eventually you’re an independent learner and you make some decisions for yourself.”
She also said students become more efficient at doing schoolwork.
“As you matriculate … your study habits change, you become more discriminating and you know what to focus in on,” Kaplan said.
Several students said working efficiently meant they didn’t do all of the work assigned on their syllabi. Kaplan said teachers expect this to an extent.
“As a faculty member, we have an understanding that there’s a continuum of learning in every class from what is mandatory to what would be the enrichment and extensions,” Kaplan said. “If I put all these things in my syllabus, they’re really separated between the things that are non-negotiable and the things I hope I can create an interest in.”
Kristin Dennis, a senior majoring in sociology, said she only keeps up with work she will physically turn in.
“My major requires a lot of reading, so I usually do the tangible work professors collect and then just cram before tests,” Dennis said.
Nolan Robertson, a junior majoring in fine arts, also said students must discern between important and unimportant readings.
“As a junior, I realize that I don’t have to do all the readings, unlike freshmen,” Robertson said. “You have to figure out what you really have to do.”

The west flank of the mid-Atlantic Ridge, at 22 latitude degrees north, will soon be the home of Katrina Edwards, professor of biological and earth sciences, as she departs Friday for a research expedition to North Pond for two months.

During the voyage, Edwards and her team of researchers will collaborate with Wolfgang Bach of the Bremen University, Germany, to investigate the microbiology of how life thrives beneath sub-seafloor sediments and rocks.
After six years of project planning to drill at North Pond, Edwards’s team will be using the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program’s flagship, the Joides Resolution, to drill more than 4.5 kilometers deep for volcanic, igneous rock samples.
“We are trying to discover the depths of microbial, intraterrestrial life,” Edwards said. “With this mission, there are a lot of uncertainties. It is very much so comparable to a space mission looking for extraterrestrial life.”
Funded in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation and in part by IODP, a marine research organization, the research data will be collected through drilled core samples of the seafloor.
Though the journey will only last two months, Edwards and Bach expect collecting data from the mid-Atlantic site for the next four to 10 years to install circulation obviation retrofit kits, or CORKs, which allow researchers to engage in continuous observations by building a permanent tube to the sea floor.
“One of the key reasons that data must be collected in a long-term setting is that the process of drilling disturbs the natural conditions,” Edwards said. “We get around this by installing long-term observatories, CORKs. This long amount of time allows the natural conditions to regenerate.”
Edwards will be joined by  more than a hundred international researchers from across the globe, including Amanda Turner, a graduate student in USC’s Earth Sciences program.
Though Turner is currently the only USC student involved in the research, the program is projected to play a beneficial role for the greater USC community by giving the university a leading role in the developing field, Edwards said.
“Continuing with the analogy between deep sea exploration programs and space exploration programs, the expedition will establish USC as an international leader in the forefront of this research,” Edwards said. “It feels much like pioneering the exploration of outer space in our own ‘Apollo’ mission.”
Students are invited to follow Edwards’ progress as she blogs her findings directly from the remote mid-Atlantic locale.

Applications opened Wednesday for the Johnson & Johnson-USC Translational Innovation Progam.
The program, a collaboration between Johnson & Johnson and the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation will foster health science and medical technologies research. Johnson & Johnson’s Corporate Office of Science and Technology will contribute $250,000 to the program over a span of two years.
Translational Innovation will serve as a mentoring program between USC faculty members that have developed ideas and employees at Johnson & Johnson.
“Each team will match up with one of the top people over in Johnson & Johnson,” said USC Director of Communications Ian Murphy. “The mentors will be people who know how to raise $5 million or who have already started five companies.”
The Stevens Institute’s Ideas Empowered Program, an existing initiative that helps bring ideas to the market place, initiated the effort to discover and support the intellectual property of those at USC. The goal of the new program is to make an impact outside of USC’s campuses through marketing and funding, according to the institute’s website.
“We saw a lot of success in [the] first year of Ideas Empowered, not just seeing a full start up company in a year of the program,” Murphy said. “Other people who took part of it say they have a better understanding of the market and how to research.”
The Translational Innovation Program has the same intentions.
“Typically there is a valley of death between academia and market,” Murphy said. “Faculty is amazing at research, not the best at understanding how the market works or how a business works … we want to bridge the gap.”
The deadline for submitting an idea is Oct. 20.
USC and Johnson & Johnson will have a joint review committee oversee submissions. Finalists will be chosen Nov. 15, and the idea that will receive funding will be revealed  Dec. 6.

USC baseball coach Frank Cruz announced that former USC and major-league baseball player Jason Brown has been named a volunteer assistant coach for the Trojans.
Brown, who played for USC from 1994 to 1997, will join associate coach Dan Hubbs and assistant coach Gabe Alvarez, both Trojan alumni, for the 2011-2012 season. Hubbs is also a first-year coach for USC, and the upcoming season will be Alvarez’s second on the Trojan staff.
“[Brown] has always been a huge supporter of USC baseball going back to his playing days and he has a relentless work ethic that we envision rubbing off on our players,” Cruz said. “Jason is going to be an asset for us in teaching and coaching all aspects of the game.”
Brown’s credentials range from All-Pac-10 honorable mentions in 1997 to an impressive career with the Los Angeles Dodgers, as well as playing for farm teams for the Tampa Bay Rays, Florida Marlins, Pittsburgh Pirates, Montreal Expos and New York Yankees. He played 11 seasons in the majors and minors.
Brown was an accomplished catcher, first baseman, designated hitter and outfielder while at USC, and was a part of the Trojan team that advanced to the College World Series in 1995. It was USC’s first appearance since 1978.
This upcoming season will be Brown’s third as a coach. He began coaching in 2009 at his alma mater, Palos Verdes High School. After one year with Palos Verdes, Brown worked as an assistant coach of the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod League.

The thing about a liability on any male sports team is that you can never be too sure he’s reformed.
No matter how reformed he is said to be, no matter how many people declare him a changed man, anyone watching is still thinking, “When’s his next outburst coming?”
So why, then, has USC been so quick to excuse senior tailback Marc Tyler’s offseason antics with the presumption he has matured? Sure, Tyler’s series of indiscretions culminating in his verbal diarrhea spewed to TMZ cameras this summer was possibly instigated by irresponsible alcohol consumption, but that’s no excuse for defiling the image of the team and university. Not to mention, the fifth-year senior had two alcohol-related incidents in the months prior.
Coaches and administrators will watch Tyler carefully for the rest of the season, no matter how much they claim he has improved in regards to his personal life, for there’s always the possibility of a backslide. But the Trojans do have an advantage to combating another incident by Tyler.
They don’t need him.
Though it’s difficult to say a team can ever have an embarrassment of riches, USC comes pretty close to it in the backfield, and it needs to start spending.
Redshirt freshman D.J. Morgan looked impressive in his start against Minnesota, averaging more than four yards per carry. Sophomore Dillon Baxter seems poised to capitalize on all that potential observers are raving about. And junior Curtis McNeal has shown some promise as well.
The common theme among these players? They’re not seniors. Tyler is.
While this season’s games are certainly important, the reality of ineligibility for postseason play still puts a damper on the year. Accordingly, it might make some sense to begin making preparations for next season — and where better to start than with the primary ball carrier?
This is Tyler’s last season with the Trojans. His playing time ends after this season. The other trio, though — which might even span to Amir Carlisle, who wowed coaches during the initial weeks of fall camp — can still have bowl aspirations.
That’s why it’s time to work them in. They need the on-field game experience. They need the reps. If USC is looking for a tailback to help carry the team like so many have done at “Tailback U,” they’ll need to develop him.
Morgan and Baxter fit the candidacy.
Of course it’s no assumption that either can match the pedigree of the running backs before them, but there’s no way to find out unless they play.
Maybe Tyler could be the team’s next 1,000-yard rusher. After all, he had 913 yards on the ground last season. What is certain, though, is he won’t be for more than one limited season.
Putting Tyler back in a role on the team in which his impact on and off the field has a ceiling but no floor is a risky proposition.
The Los Angeles Times’ Bill Plaschke commented on Tyler’s reserved and collected attitude last Saturday against Utah, noting that his suspension evidently resonated with him to some degree.
That said, there’s no doubt Tyler was on his best behavior in his first game back, patiently aware of the scrutiny he was dealing with from fans, coaches and teammates.
USC coach Lane Kiffin was right to say how proud he was of Tyler’s apparent maturation, but it’s unlikely he would have commented in kind had Tyler not rushed for 113 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries.
An athlete’s great play has routinely eschewed their punishments, as coaches often find the choice between accountability for players and excellence on the field to be an easy one. And if Tyler continues to play and put up impressive numbers, his leash might just get a little looser.
Then, when he’s in his new-found comfort zone, something might slip out, maybe putting Kiffin in an awkward position.
But then there’s an alternative.
Give Morgan and Baxter those carries. See how they do. Let Tyler continue to mature on and off the sideline. If Kiffin still can’t live without Tyler’s expected production in a few weeks, maybe throw him back in.
With the development of sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods and junior Matt Barkley’s ever-improving arm, it’s not as if the running game is going to carry all that much of the load anyway.
What Tyler must realize now is that he has put himself in a position in which his next mistake could be his last. He doesn’t need another issue, and the team most certainly can’t have another one. An indispensable player would have leverage in this situation.
But Tyler is hardly indispensable.

Only two days remain until USC faces Syracuse in a primetime showdown at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday. To correct both offensive and defensive mistakes from weeks one and two, the coaching staff plans to insert some new faces into the rotation.
Tough challenge · Sophomore Robert Woods and the rest of the USC offense are not overlooking Syracuse’s defensive capabilities. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Junior safety Drew McAllister will be playing Saturday. McAllister, who has a knack for interceptions, will aim to help the USC secondary against a potent Syracuse quarterback.
“T.J. [McDonald] has played every snap in the last two games,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We told [McAllister] he is going to play in this game, third or fourth series.”
Along with McAllister, redshirt freshman cornerback Anthony Brown is expected to receive ample playing time, possibly starting over junior Tony Burnett and sophomore Torin Harris at cornerback.
“They say they want to play more guys and I am one of those guys they want to play,” Brown said. “It has been the same the past two weeks, but this week I’m really excited because I get a chance to play. I’m really fired up.”
The USC defense is looking for an overall improvement following two games that were ultimately decided in the fourth quarter.
“We came out and we finished, that’s something we have been working on,” junior safety T.J. McDonald said. “There’s a lot of things that people didn’t see in that game that made a huge difference in our game and our team. You can definitely see the growth in our defense.”
Kiffin praised the effort of the defensive line in the first two games, especially against its most recent opponent Utah.
“I think they are playing really well and have done a good job against [the] run,” Kiffin said. “There were times they were going to have a sack and something happened and they couldn’t get the sack. I think they had a really good game.”
The coaching staff believes there are certain areas where the secondary needs to grow.
“Our [defensive backs] continue to improve,” he said. “We’re still giving up a few third and longs that we got to get better at.”
—
Following stellar performances in the first half of both games, the Trojans will look to carry their first half energy into the remainder of the game.
“We’ve had glimpses of what we are capable of in mostly the first half of both games,” junior quarterback Matt Barkley said. “Being able to put that into two full halves this week is what we are trying to do.”
Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods are ready to compete against a Syracuse defense that ranked seventh in the nation last year.
“That was last year’s defense so got to let that go,” Woods said. “This year, we just got to attack them in the run game, in the air and perform like a top offense.”
In last week’s matchup against Utah, USC stuck to a run game against a tough Ute defense. This week, the Trojans are preparing for a similar challenge.
“Just getting right back at it and being ready for whatever they throw at us,” Woods said. “They play a lot of press. We just got to be ready for quick releases and explosive plays.”
—
The Trojans have confidence in true freshman kicker Andre Heidari. Heidari made a 47-yard field goal in last week’s game against Utah.
“We don’t have much experience there with our kicker being a true freshman,” Kiffin said. “But you do feel better because he has a stronger leg. We feel good about where he’s at right now.”
With young Trojans playing on both offense and defense, Kiffin hopes mistakes made in the first two games will be corrected as the season progresses.
“It’s very frustrating because we are committed to trying to play young guys,” he said. “We have so many inexperienced players. Breakdowns happen. As a head coach, you call the plays to win the game.”
Because of the inconsistency on offense, Barkley has been criticized in regards to his performance and statistics.
“I’m more pleased with wins than anything,” Barkley said. “Ultimately when it goes down in the record books, people see the wins and not my stats for that particular game.”
—
The USC offensive line still lacks a left guard. Although freshmen Aundrey Walker and Marcus Martin have been in the rotation at practice, Kiffin has not named the starter for Saturday.
“Just throw guys in there and see,” Kiffin said.
Junior center Abe Markowitz, who missed the first two games of the season, is expected to return soon and might be cleared as early as this week.

One of the common criticisms levied against USC last season was its almost weekly fourth quarter drop-offs, failing to stave off opponents in the final minutes.
Lights out · Redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris intercepted a pass to seal the game against Minnesota in USC’s 19-17 home-opener win. Against Utah, Harris returned a blocked field goal for a touchdown to clinch the Trojans’ 23-14 victory. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Whether it was Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck toying with a leaky USC pass defense or former wide receiver Ronald Johnson dropping a potential game-winning touchdown pass against Notre Dame, USC often fell short in 2010, as three of its five losses came within a double-digit margin.
Perhaps most telling, though, is that at no point did the Trojans win a game in which they trailed entering the fourth quarter. They did, however, wind up losing three games in which they were leading or tied at the beginning of the final period.
All told, USC’s point differential in the fourth quarter last season was minus-46. Conversely, it outscored its opponents by a 102-point margin in the first three quarters.
Through two games in 2011, that trend hasn’t changed, as USC possesses a minus-one point differential in the fourth quarter before playing, arguably, any of its top five opponents this season.
After Saturday’s game, USC coach Lane Kiffin offered a brief explanation for the lack of offensive productivity in the second halves of the Trojans’ first two games.
“The bottom line is to win the game, so in the fourth quarters of these games, we have had the lead and we’ve called the game to win the game,” Kiffin said. “We haven’t called the game for stats, so we’ve been very conservative in those times.”
Some of the criticism for a lack of fourth quarter production this season has centered on junior quarterback Matt Barkley.
In the final period, Barkley is a mere 8-for-15 for 64 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions — his worst quarter statistically. Such a performance has prompted the question of whether Kiffin has been too conservative in his playcalling when the game is on the line.
“He hasn’t been behind yet,” Kiffin said of the Trojans’ third-year signal caller. “That’s really where the issue comes up. When you’re behind you got to move them so we’ve been very conservative with our calls to make sure we win the game and not worry about stats.”
Rewind to 2010, and Barkley had a 45.5 percent completion rate in the fourth quarter with a 3:2 touchdown-to-interception ratio. In 2009, he sported a 50.7 percent  completion rate with a ghastly 1:7 ratio.
“It’s frustrating because I know that we’re capable of so much more, but we just shoot ourselves in the foot,” Barkley said.
Moving forward, though, Barkley has remains optimistic.
“We’ve had glimpses of what we’re capable of in the first half of most games,” Barkley said. “Being able to put that into whole halves this week is what we’re trying to do.”
Though not pointing to any one thing in particular, Barkley noted the offense can improve in many areas.
“I think it’s a lot of things, unfortunately,” he said. “But it ultimately comes down to execution, guys focusing and not losing that mentality we have in the first half.”
The return of senior tailback Marc Tyler, who debuted against Utah, should add an additional element to the offense. Against the Utes, Tyler rushed for 24 carries for 113 yards and one touchdown.
“I thought Marc played well, especially for missing the majority of camp and going in there,”  Kiffin said. “So the good thing is hopefully he’ll improve on that.”
An encouraging development thus far has been the defense’s ability to pick up the offense’s slack.
USC’s pass defense struggled often in 2010, particularly in the fourth quarter, surrendering 13 of the 30 total passing touchdowns it gave up last season in the final period. Opposing quarterbacks were able to complete 63.7 percent of their passes for 947 yards. USC’s defense also allowed opponents to pick up 5.22 yards per rush.
In 2011, however, USC has allowed its opponents to complete only 40.7 percent of its passes for one touchdown and one interception. The rush defense has been impressively stout, surrendering 0.8 yards per attempt.
The goal moving forward, at least, according to Barkley is to get both units clicking at the same time.
“I feel like we need to keep that rhythm that we have in the first half,” Barkley said. “It’s just due to mental mistakes. I can do a better job of telling my teammates, especially the 11 that are in, just keep them focused and keep them in tune with what we need to do.”
For a team to win in the second half the coach has to be able to make the better adjustments, so far Kiffin has not been that coach.

With the rapid pace of today’s technological advancements, it’s easy to get lost in all the hub-bub. But something that is never recognized in the race to find the “next big thing” is how we got to the awe-inspiring inventions of today. In the “1001 Inventions” exhibitions that have been featured throughout the world, Muslim scientists, engineers and philosophers are finally receiving the credit they deserve.

Traveling from London to Istanbul to New York, “1001 Inventions” has made its way to the California Science Center in Los Angeles. The exhibition delves into myriad advancements made by various Muslim scholars in a fascinating and interactive manner.
Upon entering the exhibition, a short film, 1001 Inventions and the Library of Secrets, gives a succinct introduction to the exhibition and all the enticing innovations that await inside. The film is compelling as it creates an aura of wonder, which in turn establishes an air of intrigue about the groundbreaking discoveries of the Muslim innovators.
An immense “elephant clock,” invented by the exceptional mechanical engineer of the 12th century, Al-Jazari, immediately catches one’s eye. The enormous, intricate display, with knobs and levers and even small figurines, portrays how the clock would appear on the back of an elephant moving through the streets of ancient Arabia.
The work of another great inventor, Abbas Ibn Firnas, is also riveting. The innovator developed a basic structure for a glider, exploring pathways for human flight 1,000 years before the iconic Wright Brothers. The plans and designs for this progressive work are arranged in a manner that captivates viewers not only with the intriguing subject matter, but also with the interesting aesthetics.
Switching gears, and about 100 years after Ibn Firnas, the display of the revolutionary work of Ibn al-Haitham explores the world of optics. Refuting common Greek ideas, his research finally led him to invent the first camera obscura, which he called a “qamara.” The display transports you back in time as it provides a visual illustration of how ancient cameras functioned, allowing the viewer to see how al-Haitham’s “qamara” was set up.
Also featured is the noteworthy Al-Zahwari, one of the greatest physicians of the Middle Ages. His most influential discovery involved using catgut for internal stitching in surgeries. A breakthrough in medical research at the time, catgut is still used for surgeries today. Accordingly, the display honors his greatest accomplishments as it showcases the various surgical tools he designed.
Sinan, a 15th-century architect, also leaves quite the impression with a display of beautifully designed arches. This chief architect of the Ottoman sultans inspired a vast majority of the gorgeous architecture we see today. Whether in the architecture at USC or other brilliantly designed structures around the globe, Sinan’s influence is unmistakable.
“1001 Inventions” proves incredibly audience-friendly with interactive elements that encourage participation. One station allows guests to match various English words to their Arabic roots, while another display has a game where guests can match the constellations mapped by Mariam al-Astrolabi, a 10th-century astronomer.
Writings and paintings that depict Muslim scholars exchanging information go hand in hand with the individual displays. Moreover, a giant map featuring the Muslim trade route, ranging from Spain to China, showcases the various influences on science, technology and art.
This is not your average exhibition — the array of pictures, games, artifacts and even the center’s employees allows for an interactive learning experience, a far superior alternative to reading another dull textbook.
Whether you’re an expert on Muslim civilization or are simply interested in the progression of time, anybody and everybody will find the “1001 Inventions” exhibition a beautiful display of the Golden Age of Invention.
Don’t miss this opportunity to explore the history of Muslim heritage and the enthralling world of innovation and invention.
For more information on “1001 Inventions,” go to 1001inventions.com. The exhibition will be open at the California Science Center until Dec. 31.

When art lovers speak about the best places to see art in Los Angeles, they usually give locations that are well-known museums like Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Getty Villa.
Communal artwork · Some of Los Angeles’ best artwork can be found painted on local stores, buildings and even sidewalks — an indication that art media is constantly undergoing change and improvisation. - Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
But you don’t always have to brave obnoxious L.A. traffic and parking rates to get exposure to some exciting, modern works. In the streets near USC lies a hidden creative energy in the form of impressive, innovative street art that showcases some veritable urban talent.
Pulsing through Vermont Avenue, Jefferson Boulevard, Adams Boulevard and other major roads near campus is an artistic spirit manifested on walls near homes, businesses and schools. You might not realize it, but there are plenty of artists around USC creating public art pieces as small as a postcard or as large as the side of a building.
One of the simplest forms of street art is stencil art, a medium that involves making a stencil beforehand and placing it on the ground before quickly spray painting over it. It’s all around us. Keep your eyes on the ground as you walk down The Row near University Avenue, and you might spot the face of a girl with long black hair looking up at you from the sidewalk with a big smile on her face. And if you ever find yourself walking back to campus toward McClintock Avenue from The Row, keep your eyes on the ground near Hoover Boulevard right across from Wendy’s and you’ll spot a giant spray-painted unhappy face looking up at you.
But this is only the start — as it turns out, the streets surrounding our campus serve as an artistic playground for a spectrum of aesthetic tastes and personalities.
Traveling on Vermont Avenue, you can walk around the corner of Celaya Bakery and encounter two large murals, both shockingly intricate and bold. On one wall there is a piece depicting a passionate guitar-wielding Carlos Santana next to the list of bakery items. His guitar has the words “una pa’l corzaon” in white cursive letters, a phrase that translates to “one for the heart.”
The mural is done in a painterly style, the thick brushstrokes creating a passionate facial expression on the guitar legend. I spoke to one of the workers inside the bakery who told me the artist, who goes by the name of Guactemoc, frequently paints murals with the bakery owner’s permission. The mural previously pictured Michael Jackson after his death.
Across the way is an even larger piece with the words “Hate Free Community,” framed by the faces of Jimi Hendrix and Che Guevara. The bold colors are expertly chosen and paired with clever details like swirls, small birds and dark figures.
Drive down Jefferson Boulevard and you can find a variety of other street art, including an astonishingly huge piece entitled “The Knight” created by the well-known Los Angeles graffiti artist Retna, whose style is distinguished by skillful portraits and visually complex backgrounds.
And if you ever plan on making a trip to the In-N-Out in Culver City, take a little detour and make a quick stop on Arlington Avenue and Washington Boulevard.
The walls of Bob’s Automatic Transmission serve as the canvas for many artists’ works, including Guatemalan graffiti artist Cache, known for including chickens in his pieces. Two sides of the building are entirely covered with everything from a snowman holding a scroll with the words “graff artist wish list” to a deranged face holding a spray paint can with an open mouth.
The best way to find these works is to just drive, walk or bike down the streets and keep your eyes open. Though the neighborhoods might seem intimidating, standing in front of one of these works is thrilling.
You can see the craftsmanship and time spent on these pieces in the brilliant combination of colors in tags, the graffiti artists’ chosen street names and the creativity and quirkiness of characters created by the artists. Some pieces also contain striking resemblances to some people you might even recognize.
Though Los Angeles and USC foster artistic communities, the city contains hidden gems that require patient discovery.
Explore the nooks and crannies of the city to find intriguing art and witness works from artists unafraid to push the boundaries and make the city their canvas.
 
Eva Recinos is a junior majoring in English. Her column “Art Box” runs Thursdays.
Ironic that “hate free community” was painted next to a murderer (Che). Don’t think that mural painter was too bright.

Mason Jennings writes emotional songs of experience. His shamanism is the portrayal of hurt and healing. He is quoted as having said, “I am interested in the experience of life, not its meaning.”
His songs, like his philosophy, start with simplicity and then bloom into significance.
Versatile vocalist · Much of Jennings’ success is rooted in his ability to adapt his voice to fit the aura and tone of different pieces, specifically songs where he takes on the persona of other genders, souls and characters. - Photo courtesy of All Eyes Media
Jennings’ latest album, Minnesota, like much of his other music, unifies the qualities of the dark and the light battling inside the human spirit.
Deemed a “collage” album of mostly piano songs unified under the moniker of his favorite place — his home state of Minnesota — the record justifies the many facets of life.
His music proves he understands that humanity maims and loves in the same lifetime.
The album’s highlight song, “Bitter Heart,” features a unique style of piano playing in the way it shifts and carries an unfamiliar but beautiful dissonance. After the chorus, rather than extending into a predictable pop bridge, he does something unusual with the notes, returning in circles. It makes the moments of release more anticipated and pure.
Jennings is skilled at framing soft piano lines with perfect introductions of drums and textured guitar. Like in the song “No Relief,” where he uses a peaceful, reflective piano that suddenly turns manic for the lyrics, No relief / from the pain that’s in my heart.
Minnesota is a personal album without being melancholy. Jennings transcends his simplicity into a lyrical landscape that has layers of sound.
It’s easy to identify musicians who are willing to seek influence in any touching source — this album wouldn’t exist as it is without elements as varied as punk, folk and African jams.
By detailing experiences, he’s able to illuminate the many paths of life relevant to most, if not all, listeners.
“Wake Up” is a remarkably personal tale of the path of an alcoholic, presumably Jennings himself. He sings: So I went to a shrink and he said to me / Just don’t drink when you’re nervous, that’s the key / And I said ‘Okay, that sounds fine’ / I didn’t tell him I was nervous all the time.
Always unpredictable, Jennings uses a couple tunes on the album to show us different themes. “Witches Dream” sounds exactly like a story of an evil woman with a crooked, wart-ridden nose with an intro of crows cawing and synthesizer that sounds like a spell being vomited.
“Well of Love” is Latin-influenced, with a Central/South American bongo feel.
What makes Jennings especially unique is his voice seems to adapt to pretty much anything with his wide vocal range. And perhaps even more notably, he plays all the instruments on almost all of his records.
Though his last album, Blood Of Man, explored the deep darkness around us, Minnesota is a smattering of all states of being. Sometimes he slips into character, like in “Rudy” and “Clutch” (where he assumes the persona of a woman struggling with the pain of memory).  When he does this he’s still writing his own memoir — the woman might as well be him, becoming enlightened and still surrendering to what he can’t control — his subconscious.
You’re not the master but you sure ain’t the slave, he sings.
The thing that’s so unique and intimate in Minnesota is Jennings can make you feel like you’re in a kitchen and then in a foreign country, but with the same familiarity.
He sings songs that make you feel like you’re wrapped up in a cabin sweater and holding a perfect cup of tea. He wants his listeners to know: When you appreciate life, love yourself and do what you love, you might as well be anywhere.

In 2010, for example, free speech largely excused the nationally humiliating WikiLeaks intelligence leak; Last March, citing free speech, the Supreme Court roundly approved the Westboro Baptist Church’s right to picket the funerals of homosexual soldiers.
And now, as if we hadn’t had enough, new armies are gathering on another free speech battlefield that is manifesting itself in a trial that began Sept. 8, just shy of a year since a public outcry led to the arrest of 11 students who came to be known as the “Irvine 11.” Their prosecution could cast doubt among the most vocal collegiate students about whether it is appropriate to speak out at all.
Eleven UCI students, all Muslim, expressed discontent with the Israeli ambassador Michael Oren at a February 2010 event.
The reason for their discontent was largely because of the 2008 Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip.
One of the 11 went so far as to yell at Oren, “How many Palestinians did you kill?”
The students were then arrested for their involvement in the protest and charged with conspiracy to disturb a meeting. Their story amassed media attention and the caterwauling collective “Irvine 11” hit the mainstream media.
The wrongful arrest of the 11 students could potentially cause severe repercussions among college students who might see this as reason to avoid protest if there’s a chance of arrest.
Furthermore, it is dishonest for the “Irvine 11” case’s prosecution to claim to be acting in the interest of free speech because it inhibited the free speech of the 11 students by arresting them even though no acts of violence were committed.
Moreover, this infringement of free speech can have additional adverse effects on college students because it could lead to distrust of the government if it continues to allow the violation of free speech.
It’s true that these students violated certain social norms. They broke etiquette by interrupting Oren, whose turn it was to talk.
They also violated UC Irvine policy by disrupting a university-sponsored event, and for this, they perhaps deserve some form of academic discipline.
But as American citizens the 11 students were well within their rights to perform such an act of peaceful protest, and therefore don’t deserve to be punished for voicing their opinions.
Now the “11” defendants are finally on trial at the Orange County Courthouse, each charged with dual misdemeanors  and facing up to one year in jail if found guilty.
The prosecution has accused the defendants of trampling Oren’s right to free speech.
“They didn’t want to have an exchange of ideas,” District Attorney Dan Wagner told the Los Angeles Times on Sept. 8.
There is fault in the prosecution’s argument because, if anything, the attempt on behalf of the student’s to voice their opinions could have been the beginning of a conversation.
The defense rightfully responded that the “11” were peacefully and lawfully protesting, and that arresting them constituted as an affront to free speech.
When we talk about “free speech,” we are talking about speech free from government-imposed impediments.
Free speech is a headache, yes — but it’s worth the trouble. Here’s hoping that the “Irvine 11” trial acquits its defendants, that it affirms our beautiful right to make noise as students.
Most importantly, one can only hope that the 11 UCI students will be acquitted to show we still have the inalienable right to speak out as college students.

If the Supreme Court allows hateful, disgusting speech towards our marines as freedom of speech, then shouting facts and non-violent words at someone who is considered a war criminal and violator of UN resolutions AROUND THE world SHOULD also be freedom of speech. 
Calling these students “extremists” justifies that you are pretty much a racist and is stereotyping them for their race/religion.
The Westboro Church does say things I do find offensive but they have the right to be offensive.   They do not enter churches or go to the actual funeral and interfere with the proceedings.  In the Supreme Court case they were 1000 feet away from the funeral area.
The students could have protested outside the lecture hall and said all the hateful or disgusting things they wished.   They didn’t do that.  They went inside to repeatedly disrupt the lecture and prevent to prevent Michael Oren from being heard.   Pretty significant difference.
There is no such thing as “Freedom of Speech” That is misnoma
What a terribly thought out article-  either this kid has an ill-thought agenda or he didn’t take more than 2 minutes to research the incident or he just decided to scream “free speech!!” because of course that always sounds right.
Nothing to see here folks.
They must have meant to run this in the Onion right?
hahhahahahahaha
This is an incredibly poorly written opinion.  As one of the responders posted, Erwin Chemerinsky, the country’s foremost constitutional law expert, this is not a First Amendment right case.  The students were disruptive and essentially committed a crime.
Stick to creative writing, fren.
This obviously isn’t your thing.
Memo to writer Ryan Kindel:
The Westboro Baptist Church did not picket the funerals of homosexual soldiers.  The fallen soldiers and Marines were not homosexuals.  They were unfortunate war dead whose funerals happened to be used by the Westboro Baptist Church fanatics as a podium for their hatred.
Please take Journalism 101 over again.  A real journalist gets the facts straight.  
Jim Gilchrist, President, The Minuteman Project (Class of ’73, Univ. of R. I. School of Journalism)
This is grossly poor analysis.
I don’t know if you know much about the incident and the emails between the studnts.   You sure don’t know much about the First Admendment.
Erwin Chermerinksy, the dean of the UC Irvine Law School,  is an expert on the First Admentment.
I suggest you get educated and read his piece on the incident.
“The government, including public universities, always can impose time, place and manner restrictions on speech. A person who comes into my classroom and shouts so that I cannot teach surely can be punished without offending the 1st Amendment. Likewise, those who yelled to keep the ambassador from being heard were not engaged in constitutionally protected behavior.
**Freedom of speech, on campuses and elsewhere, is rendered meaningless if speakers can be shouted down by those who disagree.** 
The law is well established that the government can act to prevent a heckler’s veto — to prevent the reaction of the audience from silencing the speaker. There is simply no 1st Amendment right to go into an auditorium and prevent a speaker from being heard, no matter who the speaker is or how strongly one disagrees with his or her message.”

There is a major flaw in the argument made here an that is that the students “peacefully” protested. There was nothing peaceful about them. They each stood up and screamed at Michael Oren, which video of the event shows very clearly. They did so in an effort to stop him from speaking, infringing on Oren’s right to free speech. If they wanted to engage in a discussion they could have done so during the Q&A portion of the event. Unfortunately that was never their intention, they wanted to stop Oren from being able to speak. The students deserve to be punished.
You are right that free speech is “a headache”, but while you are quick to jump to the defense of the students, you forget that Michael Oren has a right to free speech too.
The students were not exercising their right to free speech and they did not peacefully protest, they conspired to infringe on the rights of another American…that is why they are on trial, and I hope that they receive proper punishment.
Come out and support free speech by attending the trial: Santa Ana Courthouse – 700 West Civic Center Drive, Santa Ana CA 92701 Courtroom C1 – 2nd Floor
I’ll be there to support the prosecution of these extremists.  Thanks for the info!
Westboro Baptist Church spreads its hate through picketing in our streets, provoking attacks, with abusive language and flag desecration, attempting to create a confrontation. This is not a church, this is a hate group.  This is not about protesting, freedom, or God. They are in it for the money and the press; this is a family law firm. They are not a “church.” It is a scam. They go after anything that can get them in the news. This is a family of lawyers using this “god hates you” thing to make money. It is time for this scam to end.

Hide your beers and hide your bongs — your future bosses are climbing into your Facebook accounts, snatching your pictures up.
According to a survey by Vault, a recruiting website, three out of every four employers use Facebook in the hiring process. Conscientious job applicants know employers check digital trails. Few USC students need to be told to make sure pictures of last weekend’s party aren’t accessible to strangers.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
This is not to say we should pay more attention to our online profiles; when it comes to our job prospects, we shouldn’t have to do so in the first place.
Though it is in the interest of employers to know their applicants well, an online profile is almost never an accurate portrayal of an applicant’s abilities in the workplace. The practice of looking at applicant profiles is unethical: It erodes the wall between office life and private life.
Before the digital age, office life and private life were easier to define. Office life happened — believe it or not — in the office. It is true the lines were never completely solid: the more responsibility an employee had, the more he or she needed to maintain a clean public image. Nevertheless, one’s habits, hobbies and personal views were not as accessible as they are in this particular decade.
Today employers can read, hear, watch and even save their conversations.
But the ease of monitoring applicants does not make it right or useful.
The idea that people’s qualifications can be judged accurately by their social media profiles is only partially correct. Even though many older adults use websites like Facebook and Twitter for networking, among teens and 20-somethings, social media websites have a truly social function.
Thus, especially among college students, Facebook often misrepresents priorities. Many students choose to highlight how fun they are over how smart or dependable they are. A winner of multiple math awards  might emphasize pictures of herself dancing wildly at a concert. A student known for being thoughtful and balanced in the classroom might be politically incorrect in his status updates.
Research has shown people portray certain parts of themselves accurately on Facebook, even when they think they’re showing idealized versions of themselves. A study at Tufts University found people’s levels of extroversion and openness shine through on Facebook. Another study reported by Time magazine confirms the results: The study found that extraversion and openness, along with agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism, show through in people’s profiles.
Still, neither study says anything about more specific traits that relate to the workplace — traits like dependability, teamwork and emotional maturity.
There’s nothing wrong with emphasizing different parts of one’s personality in various places. As long as a person works hard and maintains reasonable respect for the law, there’s no reason to write him or her off for not being a saint.
Why, then, must companies continue to pretend that our private lives are so important in the workplace? Monitoring politicians and activists is one thing, but looking into the private lives of potential accountants and assistants is uncalled for.
There is an even more sinister side to Facebook monitoring. It makes covert discrimination easier.
Imagine two applicants who want to work for a company with a conservative corporate culture. Both applicants are equally polished and qualified, but one applicant is a fan of “Support Gay Adoption” on Facebook. The other lists Mitt Romney as his biggest inspiration. Ask yourselves who will get the job and ask yourselves if that’s fair.
Though applicants have the power to protect themselves against social media monitoring, unexpected privacy changes shouldn’t threaten people’s livelihoods. If a company really needs its applicants’ personal information, it should stop sneaking around and gather it up front.

“The practice of looking at applicant profiles is unethical: It erodes the wall between office life and private life.” Just about sums it up…. agreed for sure.

Annie Erin Clark has been busy lately. The 28-year-old has been getting her hands dirty in alternative music since graduating Berklee College of Music in 2003.
After developing her stage moniker, St. Vincent, and blasting to new heights with her twisted pop records, she has been enjoying the fruits of touring (opening for Arcade Fire and Death Cab For Cutie) and celebrity.
On Tuesday, St. Vincent released Strange Mercy. The album follows her sophomore effort, Actor, and expands upon her uniquely distorted sound. St. Vincent has crafted a psychodelic sound that blends the styles of Regina Spektor and Dirty Projectors while adding some pop-rock flair. It’s an immersive experience with an onslaught of sounds and idiosyncratic vocal stylings.
One prime cut from the album is “Surgeon,” a slow-tempo track both blissful and eerie. Her voice soars effortlessly over simple synths and melodic lyrics. Its easy to “get along” with this song, as she repeats endlessly throughout the tune.
Beside her new foray into the land of record sales and national tours, St. Vincent has also landed a particularly special and noteworthy gig on the other side of Hollywood. Surely a music industry professional by now, St. Vincent is lending her voice to the hit HBO series Boardwalk Empire.
St. Vincent will be joining the likes of Regina Spektor, Martha Wainwright and the Nighthawks who are performing songs from the 1910s and 20s on upcoming soundtracks for the television show.
While St. Vincent has recently gone into the studio to work on her track for the series, the first soundtrack will be released before her contribution debuts. But what a chance for this constantly overlooked musician.
Boardwalk Empire returns to television Sept. 25 for its second season, so keep your ears tuned in for one of today’s hidden treasures on the show. Strange Mercy is currently streaming online at NPR.org.

The federal Energy Department came under fire Wednesday as it was questioned by Congress about its decision to support a loan to Solyndra, the now-bankrupt company that had been the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s green energy stimulus.
The $528 million loan from taxpayer money had been given to Solyndra in 2009 to explore renewable energy through solar panel technology and to create more jobs during the economic downturn.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will look into whether the Energy Department rushed approval of the loan or restructured the loan despite knowledge of the company’s financial troubles.
“You should have protected the taxpayers and made some forceful actions here,” Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.) said during the hearings.
Solyndra went bankrupt Sept. 6, but emails show the company had concerns about remaining solvent since the beginning of this year. Company officials cite competing prices from outside sources such as China.
“The rest of the world takes the industry enormously seriously,” said Jonathan Silver, Energy Department loans director. “It’s a multitrillion-dollar market that will create tens of thousands of jobs. We invented this technology and we should produce it here. … This is a battle we must fight and win.”

This year has been full of big-budget 3-D productions; so much so that big production houses are now considering rereleasing past super-hits in 3-D.
On Sept. 12, a four-minute 3-D preview of the “Danger Zone” aerial flight sequence from the 1986 classic Top Gun was screened at the International Broadcasting Convention (IBC) in Amsterdam. It is rumored the whole movie could be re–released in 3-D in early 2012. Disney’s Lion King will be released Sept. 16 in a 3-D avatar. In May, Paramount Pictures announced Titanic will be-released in 3-D next year to mark the 100th anniversary of the ship’s doomed voyage.
The current year has already seen a host of 3-D movies, such as Kung Fu Panda 2, Green Lantern, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pirates of the Caribbean: on Stranger Tides and Rio.
So it should come as no surprise that producers are now turning their attention to big hits from the past to rerelease them in 3-D. The growing trend amongst big production houses to indulge in 3-D is no doubt reflective of the desire of these companies to use the best available technologies to produce the best possible movies.
While old movies are getting touched up, new movies of existing movie franchises are also being made in 3-D. Sony Pictures, on the other hand, has taken it to another level. On Sept. 12, the company announced the third movie in the Men in Black franchise will also be released in IMAX 3-D. The movie is reportedly being made at a budget of more than $200 million and is slated for release May 25, 2012.

If you haven’t already heard, yesterday famous Italian fashion house Missoni launched its line for Target stores.
The collection boasts the brand’s signature zigzagged and striped patterns for a fraction of the cost of the original prices, normally sold at high-end boutiques and department stores. The Missoni line also includes accessories and home furnishing, with prices ranging from $2.99 to $599.
But don’t expect to have much to choose from. In the Los Angeles area alone, most Targets have completely sold out. Store managers from the La Cienega and Century Boulevard locations say the inventory was wiped out around 10:30 this morning, and don’t know when or if it will be replenished.
It seems Target’s website was also unprepared for Missoni-mania, seeing as their site has been down for the better part of the day. After five hours of waiting, I was finally able to crack it, only to find slim pickings.
People who were wise enough to go to Target’s opening Tuesday morning were buying not only for themselves, but also to sell on websites like eBay, for huge profits.
Want to see what all the fuss is about? Check out the Target website, or, if that fails, go see the Missoni lookbook.

Junior forward Samantha Johnson of the women’s soccer team and senior tailback Marc Tyler were named USC’s Credit Union Student-Athletes of the Week on Tuesday.
Following her assist on the Trojans’ only goal at the Trojan Invitational Tournament this past weekend, Johnson was also selected as one of two USC players on the All-Tournament Team. Johnson’s assist to sophomore midfielder Autumn Altamirano in the 33rd minute gave USC an early 1-0 lead against Texas before the Longhorns pulled away with a 2-1 win in overtime Sunday at McAlister Field.
Meanwhile, Tyler turned heads after returning from a team suspension by leading all players in rushing with 113 yards on 24 carries in Saturday’s 23-14 win over Utah at the L.A. Coliseum. His six-yard run to the left edge of the end zone in the first quarter was his first touchdown of the season as well as the Pac-12’s first touchdown in conference history, giving USC an early 10-0 lead in the conference’s inaugural game.
With a reception for 19 yards to back up a 4.7-yard rushing average, Tyler returned strong-willed and ready to run after missing the first game of the season for his inappropriate comments to celebrity news outlet TMZ in July.
The soccer team plays next at Portland on Sunday at 1 p.m., while the football team hopes to rally behind Tyler’s impressive rushing against Syracuse on Saturday at 5 p.m. at the Coliseum.
Congratulations to Marc way to come back strong.  SC Football all the way!!!
Now for the other SC Futbol team. This is wrong the student-athlete of the week should be the player who saved us from total embarrassment.

A small panic ensued among USC freshmen Tuesday when a mixup at Everybody’s Kitchen prevented staff from serving their much-beloved chicken nuggets, an event fondly dubbed “Chicken Nugget Tuesdays” by many students.
An error in EVK’s ordering process led to the nuggets being served Monday instead of the traditional Tuesday.
“I remember thinking, ‘Whoa! Today’s not Tuesday, and we’re getting chicken nuggets,'” said Christopher McClure, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering.
Indignant freshmen quickly banded together to create a Facebook Group, “Bring Back Chicken Nugget Tuesdays at EVK,” with talk of a petition to follow.
“Bring back Chicken Nugget Tuesdays!,” demanded Daniel Luciani, an undeclared freshman.
EVK management assured students Chicken Nugget Tuesdays weren’t going anywhere, and would recommence next week.
“We will have our nuggets next week. I know it’s a big thing around here, it was just a mishap in ordering. Chicken nuggets will be back, don’t worry. We will get you your chicken nuggets,” said EVK manager Deanna Giles.

It’s a college newspaper that’s trying to present itself as serious. That’s my main problem. While funny, it shouldn’t be the first thing I saw when I clicked on dt.com that day. And im just bothered by outrage over something so meaningless
I’m not sure what’s worse. That idiot freshmen are upset about chicken nuggets, or that this made September 15’s print edition.
Anon: I disagree. It’s a blog post, not a print story (as the 9-0 article was), and is obviously presented with the levity the situation warrants. An appropriately short and funny read.
This sort of stupidity from freshmen makes me want to bring back hazing just so they have some sort of perspective on what suffering actually entail.
This article is pathetic. The Daily Trojan should stop reporting on where students are partying (the early September cover article on students going to the 9-0 for example) and about something insignificant as chicken nugget Tuesdays. This reflects poorly on the USC student body that this merits a DT article and a petition. Talk about spoiled and overpriveleged. I’m embarrassed to be a USC student.
Chill out, dude. The story is supposed to be lighthearted and funny.
This is a college paper. If you want serious news, read the LA Times.
You will never be happy.   It’s no way to go through life bro!
This is fantastic!
