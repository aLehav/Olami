Long-term exposure to near-roadway pollution and secondhand tobacco smoke correlates to childhood obesity, according to a study released last week by researchers from the Keck School of Medicine of USC.
Five of the study’s authors are in the Keck Department of Preventive Medicine.

Dr. Rob McConnell, lead author on the study, found evidence that reveals a direct connection between higher childhood obesity among children who are exposed to more air pollutants than in those who are not, and that exposures to tobacco smoke and to near-roadway pollution combine for a greater effect. The results were released on Wednesday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.
According to McConnell, the adverse effects of mixed air pollutants have been well-known for an extended period of time.
“The effect of smog that blankets a whole community and large parts of the community has been known for a long time,” McConnell said. “Near-roadway pollution probably has a different mixture of pollutants in it, and it probably has effects that are independent from regional pollution.”
McConnell also listed other conditions such as respiratory illness, asthma and diabetes as by-products of exposure to a mixture of air pollutants. The evidence for the study derives from longitudinal research conducted via a series of experiments and data collected since 1992.
The results from the USC study include data from children living throughout Southern California. By measuring height and weight, McConnell and his colleagues analyzed residence proximity to roadways, prevailing wind direction in the area and lifetime tobacco smoke exposure in order to determine their effects on children’s weight.
“The amount that is accounted for by the combined exposure to secondhand smoke and near-roadway exposure is about 13 pounds,” he said. “Somewhere around the order of 5 or 6 percent of excess body weight … It’s a big effect that we are seeing.”
McConnell said that by studying the impact lifetime exposure to pollution has on the children once they become adults, the team can get a more thorough understanding of the potential correlation to obesity.
“We have a population now that’s just turning 18, and in those young adults we will be looking at lifetime exposure to pollution and how that relates to body fat and also characteristics of body fat,” he said.
McConnell says the research team plans to study body fat distribution within this population and also potential blood markers that could indicate pre-diabetes.
The study also revealed that pollution could potentially impact the brain in terms of how people make decisions about the food they eat.
“There is evidence that air pollution has effects on the brain and as a result of that, people eat more, or it can be changing metabolism in some way,” McConnell said. “It could be acting on fat and changing the way fat metabolizes calories or the way that we metabolize fat[s] that are in storage.”
McConnell noted the importance of isolating biological explanations for this phenomenon rather than evidence associated more with socioeconomic factors.
“The important thing is that these effects that we are seeing have some biologically plausible mechanisms. I think that makes it more likely that these are real effects of these combustion product exposures and not just explained by socioeconomic status or other social factors that might be associated with where you live and your weight,” McConnell said. “We do our best to adjust for social factors that might explain these relationships and they don’t … We haven’t been able to find other explanations for it besides the air pollution and secondhand smoke.”
When asked how the evidence might affect USC students, McConnell offered several suggestions based on his research.
First, McConnell urged USC students to engage in physical exercise in a non-polluted area that is separate from busy, highly populated streets with vehicles. Students who jog down Figueroa Street, for example, are at an increased risk of breathing in pollutants as opposed to students who exercise in other areas such as the Lyon Center.
Secondly, McConnell suggested that students live in an area far from busy intersections. Finally, he proposed that a call to action must be made by lawmakers and scientists to create policy change.
“The latest findings by Dr. McConnell reveal new and shocking potential harms caused by cigarette smoking and air pollution,” said Jason Boren, a registered nurse at the USC University Hospital. “It’s a privilege to be a part of a team such as USC Keck Medical Center, that places such a high priority on preventative medicine.”

President C. L. Max Nikias gave his annual address to students and parents on Saturday afternoon in Bovard Auditorium.
In his speech, Nikias highlighted the university’s achievements within the past year and provided details about upcoming projects and goals.
State of Troy · President C.L. Max Nikias discussed his own experience as a parent of USC students in his address to families this weekend. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Before Nikias spoke, Presidents of the USC Parents Association Larry and Deborah Castro took the stage to announce the recipients of the 2014 Steven B. Sample Teaching & Mentoring Awards, a faculty recognition program now in its 11th year. This year’s honorees were David W. Ginsburg, Stacy Geck and Paul Young.
David W. Ginsburg, an assistant professor in the USC Environmental Studies program, serves as the faculty advisor for the USC Environmental Studies Scientific Dive Club as well as on the Research Advisory Committee for the USC Wrigley Marine Science Center.
Stacy Geck, an associate professor of clinical management communication in the Marshall School of Business, was recognized for her role in leading freshmen students in the Global Leadership Program in China and the Learning about International Commerce program in Singapore.
Paul Young, an assistant professor of practice in the Thornton School of Music, specializes in jazz trombone and serves as director of the Music Industry minor program.
In his address, Nikias talked about his own experience as a USC parent, as both of his daughters graduated from the university.
“My wife Niki and I have a sense of the pride you all feel today … we know firsthand how a USC education prepares a young person for life. Your children are in excellent hands,” he said.
Nikias highlighted the university’s academic achievements, including the relocation of two prominent neuroscientists, Arthur Toga and Paul Thompson, from UCLA to USC’s research facilities. Nikias also pointed out the university’s advancements in the arts, including the new USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation, which enrolled its first class of students this fall.
“It’s great to hear about the successes that are happening across the university, not just in my program. President Nikias’ speech today demonstrated why USC has earned a position as a top-tier research university,” said Addison Salzman, a sophomore majoring in aerospace engineering who attended the address with his father.
Also in Nikias’ address was a description of The Village, a residential and commercial retail complex expected to be completed by fall 2017.
“When this majestic and modern Tuscan-style village opens, we will offer a second-to-none living and learning experience,” Nikias said.
Nikias’s speech was aimed at informing students and their parents about the university’s goals.
“I’m really glad my family had the opportunity to be here this weekend,” said Ebonka Agboje, a sophomore majoring in computer science. “Hearing the president talk today made me particularly proud to call this university my home.”

USC’s Environmental Affairs Organization is aiming to bring solar panels to campus through their new initiative called the Go Solar Campaign.
What began as a student-driven petition has now evolved into a multifaceted effort to ensure that USC goes solar. The petition currently in circulation claims that despite the efforts of students, the university has not responded to the desire for more efficient energy.
“Despite USC’s reputation as a cutting-edge research institute, commitments to sustainability and its location in sunny downtown Los Angeles, the campus does not currently have solar panels. Over the past few years, student environmental groups, such as us, the Environmental Affairs Organization (EAO), a member organization of USC Environmental Student Assembly, have not been given a commitment to action on this issue,” read a statement on the petition’s website.
Alexander Vermie, a senior majoring in environmental studies who is in charge of the Go Solar Campaign, acknowledged his predecessors’ previous attempts at bringing solar energy to USC, but noted that they were impeded by some of the administration’s concerns.
Despite recent overcast skies, California is the perfect location for solar energy, a resource upon which many local schools have already capitalized. According to Vermie, Occidental College, the California Institute of Technology and Stanford University have all implemented solar power. Even many smaller, Los Angeles-based community colleges have transitioned to sustainable energy on a much smaller budget than that which is available to USC.
The Environmental Affairs Organization, leading the charge on this push for solar panels, has engaged the administration about the issue.
“They are very focused on the financials of the project,” Vermie said. “That’s why they haven’t done it themselves. They want a return on investment on new projects that they don’t believe they will get from solar panels.”
In order to address these specific concerns, EAO is pursuing alternative means to implement the use of solar power that would mitigate the financial burdens of installing solar panels, such as a donor-based system or power purchasing agreements. The latter has proven popular among other universities as it creates a mutually beneficial relationship between solar companies and colleges.
In this system, the administration leases out land for the installation of solar panels, and in return, the university acquires a cheaper form of electricity. This requires no up-front costs for the administration.
In trying to persuade USC to execute EAO’s proposal, they have cited the success of other schools. The University of California schools, for example, announced two agreements in September that constituted the largest solar energy purchase by any United States institution of higher education.
Ethan Bialick, a junior majoring in business administration, has taken the lead in constructing the business plan that EAO will present to USC.
“We will be outlining the reasons why USC should go solar, and how it should do so. We’re really examining all the different options available,” he said.
Vermie sees this as an achievable goal considering it is incremental in nature and financially beneficial to the university. EAO also wants to engage new donors who haven’t made a financial contribution to the school in the past to encourage them to contribute.
Bialick said the prospect of donating for solar energy could be incentivized for donors.
“The idea is that donors could collectively contribute funds towards solar projects which would enable them to actually be recognized for their efforts. We aren’t sure what that system looks like. We are considering collaborating with Ignite USC as a crowdsourcing platform,” Bialick said.
In terms of next steps, EAO is disseminating more information to the student body concerning solar energy, as well as continuing with the petition. They also seek to host more campus-awareness events as the end of the semester approaches.
Overall, Vermie is optimistic about the solar panels.
“We can really make this happen if [we] get ourselves organized and [have] a lot of student support,” he said.
If the EAO is successful then the latest solar PV technology is new Gen 2 bifacial (double sided) solar panels.  This advanced technology has been around for the past 6 years but it was always considered to be far too expensive to install. Now because of new technological advances Hyper X 2 Bifacial solar panels can be purchased at a much lower cost than many standard single sided solar panels.
Instead of boxy looking 1 1/2 to 2 inch thick framed Gen 1 solar panels, these new higher performance Gen 2 solar panels are only 1/4 inch thin and are made with a stronger, see through, glass on glass, frameless, construction that allows sunlight to pass through and reflect off the roof’s surface, thus illuminating the backside of the double sided solar cells, producing additional power.
A mere 10% boost in reflected light can raise this 340 watt solar panel’s output to 374 watts without taking up anymore roof space. New Hyper X 2 solar offers a better PTC to STC ratio “Real World” performance according to the California Energy Commission’s performance rating listings than over 100 of SunPower’s solar panel models.
And they offer a very high 92.88% PTC to STC performance ratio. Hyper X 2 also offers a heat resistant -0.31%/degree C temperature coefficient for better performance in warm/hot climates. And when it comes to aesthetics, nothing even comes close to Hyper X 2’s glass on glass, see through, frameless construction.
With N-type mono-crystalline bifacial cells for double sided power production, up to a 21.5% efficiency rating, superior aesthetics, and a price that outcompetes the solar lease and PPA company’s offerings, very few products on the market compares to Hyper X 2 Solar.

The Dept. of Public Safety hosted a social at City Park apartments on Saturday aimed at providing safety tips for international students and an opportunity to discuss their safety concerns.

In July, Xinran Ji, a second-year electrical engineering graduate student, was found dead in the apartment complex after being assaulted a few blocks away.
“We wanted to assure his friends that we do care, that we’re concerned about their safety and that as a result of that tragedy we want to work with them to make for a better, safer community,” said DPS Chief John Thomas. “We want to bridge the gap and have open lines of communication and develop a relationship with the international students that’s better than it’s been.”
The event featured Captain Jennifer Thomas of the Los Angeles Police Department Harbor Division. Thomas, who immigrated to the United States as a teenager, is the first Chinese female lieutenant and captain in LAPD history.
Thomas spoke in both English and Mandarin about the importance of understanding one’s surroundings and being aware, particularly when walking alone. With volunteers from the audience she demonstrated that a student talking, texting or looking at the ground while walking is more susceptible to attack. Thomas said safety is often a heightened concern for international students who don’t know the area and could also encounter a language barrier.
“I think the problem is just not being aware of their surroundings and some of the cultural differences,” Thomas said.
But Thomas said she hopes to serve as both a friendly face and a role model for students.
“I’m not 6 feet tall, I’m not 250 pounds, but I had the dream of becoming a police officer, and if I can keep myself safe and physically fit, I think they can relate to me more,” she said. “As a woman immigrant to this country, being able to pursue my dream, just because I’m a Chinese woman, I think it does bridge that gap to see that they can take on their own security and be safe.”
City Park resident and first-year graduate student in public administration Qianmin Ding said that after hearing about the death of three Chinese students in the past two years, being educated on how to stay safe was very important to her as an international student from China.
“It’s a really big concern for me because I usually stay late at the library,” Ding said. “[The event] resolved my sense of safety and I’ll watch out more in the future.”
Elvy Fuentes, a senior majoring in human biology, is also a resident of City Park, and though she’s not an international student, she said she was surprised and grateful that DPS took the initiative to talk to students. Still, she said what happened to Ji could happen to anyone, and it’s important for the community as a whole to have knowledge of how to stay safe.
“[Ji] could have lived anywhere around the area, so it’s not just City Park,” she said. “But I think if anything, this helps with awareness. The more aware you are of your surroundings and the more aware you are of the resources you have at school, the more protected you are.”
DPS Community Relations Officer Elizabeth Carreño said she had the idea just a few weeks ago that students might be more receptive to listening to DPS if officers came to them.
“I thought about numbers,” Carreño said. “I wanted there to be about 10 or 15 officers and there’s 500 tenants, so I thought it was easier for us to come to them.”
Thomas said though DPS events on campus tend to have low turnout, he was pleased with Saturday’s event, which hosted more than 50 attendees. He said it was also an opportunity for him to directly address student concerns and he plans to hold similar events in the future.
One student mentioned that the CSC officer previously stationed at his apartment was not patrolling the area as much, and the student no longer felt safe. Thomas promised to try to address student concerns wherever possible.
“These are examples of concerns I would not have gotten if we hadn’t been here,” Thomas said. “I think it’s time for us to think outside the box and we’re going to go where students are. We’ll do [events] on Saturdays. We’ll go to their residence[s]. I just want to make it convenient for the students.”

For many USC students, skateboarding is a quick way to get to class that allows for a few extra minutes of sleep. For USC alumna Amelia Brodka, it’s not only her profession and passion, it’s also her personal battleground.
Fighting for her right · During her senior year at USC, Brodka produced Underexposed: A Women’s Skateboarding Documentary, a film focusing on the lack of female recognition in the traditionally male-dominated sport. She argues that skateboarding needs to evolve to match its demographics. – Photo courtesy of Julian Bleecker 
During her senior year at USC, she made a feature-length film focused on women in the skateboarding industry, but she didn’t stop there. Her enthusiasm for getting more girls involved in skating catapulted from the screen and into real life. Her nonprofit organization, EXPOSURE, hosts the largest women’s skateboarding competition in the world, presents inspirational speeches at schools and showcases healthy living — all while using the profits to benefit survivors of domestic violence.
“The first time I saw a skateboard, I was about 7 years old and we’d just come to America from Poland,” Brodka said of her introduction to the sport. “My brother had a skateboard but he didn’t let me use it. And then [the skateboard] got run over by a car, didn’t skate again for a while,”
On a family trip, Brodka went to see the X Games. Tucked away in the corner of the competition, she saw the female competitors, and suddenly, it clicked — that was where she belonged. Seeing people she could relate to made the sport more accessible.
“I love skateboarding. It has shaped my entire life and my entire outlook on life, it has essentially taught me how to be diligent and focused enough to get into a college like USC,” Brodka said.
For most of her high school career on the East Coast, Brodka competed against boys until she was told about professional competitions for females in the West. Though she was becoming more aware of women’s role in the sport, she still noticed that sponsors showcased and supported the guys on the team more than the girls. It was these observations and experiences that led her to realize the industry needed to catch up with its expanding demographics.
“There weren’t that many girls doing it,” Brodka said.  “I don’t know whether I would blame that on any sort of barrier but I just know that in my town, there was only one other girl who skated,”
Brodka’s film was her senior project as a narrative studies major at USC, but it went far beyond fulfilling an assignment for a grade. UNDEREXPOSED: A Women’s Skateboarding Documentary included not only Brodka’s personal story but also interviews with other professional skateboarders, high-ups in both the publishing and marketing side of the skateboard industry and even the president of the International Skateboarding Federation. Her navigation of the industry from both the perspective of a professional and a writer allowed her to emphasize the industry’s need for evolution.
“The skateboarding industry follows the same structure over the last few decades. It has existed because it was only guys that did it. Now there’s a rise of girls that do it and it’s different, and the industry doesn’t think about it or the new customers and how to speak to them and how to engage them and how to, through that, showcase them,” Brodka said.
Despite the flaws that Brodka sees in the skateboarding community, she doesn’t harbor any resentment. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Her immense love for the sport and its community is the very thing that drives her to institute change.
“I think it’s a wonderful community, it’s an incredible activity to do. It should feel as if it’s open for anyone to participate in,” Brodka said. “Beyond that, girls and women should feel encouraged to participate in whatever they want to be in. Their perception of what they can be involved in shouldn’t be shaped by the media. They should be able to step outside the preconceptions.”
Brodka doesn’t plan to stop at finding more opportunities for female skaters; she said she also hopes to positively impact other aspects of their lives. Through exposure to skateboarding, women are educated and empowered to make healthier decisions. Women who have survived domestic violence are given second chances through EXPOSURE’s funding, and both boys and girls alike are inspired by speeches given in schools by members of the organization.
It’s hard to say what the future holds for someone who seems so unstoppable, but one thing’s for sure, Brodka can always be found on her board.
“No matter what I will be doing, I will always be skateboarding. I can’t imagine my life without it,” she said.

This winter season features a multitude of films, some of the most anticipated written by USC alumni. Whether the chilly December or January nights call for a heartwarming tale or a sci-fi thriller, these upcoming movies will serve as the perfect companion for winter.

Search Party, a film written by USC alumnus Andrew Waller and his high school friend, Mike Gagerman and director Scot Armstrong, tells the classic story of a night gone wrong. The movie follows Daniel “Nardo” Narducci, played by Thomas Middleditch, after he ends up in solely gold leggings shivering in the Mexican desert as a result of a carjacking. This happens just 24 hours after he is left at the altar by his soulmate after his best friends Jason (T.J. Miller) and Evan (Adam Pally) scared her off. Jason and Evan are then the only ones able to find their lost friend and they embark on a journey to do just that.
“There’s dangers of the road trip, fun times of the road trip, the dangers of the Indian casino, Tijuana … there’s sort of a lot to enjoy for the college students,” Waller said.
Search Party also features well-known actresses such as Alison Brie, who plays Annie Edison in Community, and Krysten Ritter. The film is directed by Scot Armstrong, writer of The Hangover Part II, which creates an assemblage of hysterical writers, actors and director that will provide audiences their biggest laughs of the winter.
Waller credits USC as being an important foundation for building a network of fellow writers. “I met a lot of great people that I still work with and interact with. It’s a great school, and I really enjoyed the people in my class,” he said.
USC alumni Scott Alexander  and Larry Karaszewski have also grown since their freshman days in Marks Tower. Storming the entertainment industry, the duo’s new film Big Eyes will be released in theaters this Christmas. The film follows the true story of Margaret Keane and her success in drawing big-eyed children. In the upcoming feature, Amy Adams plays Margaret, a successful artist in the 1950s whose husband, Walter Keane portrayed by Christoph Waltz, claims credit for her work and becomes a national celebrity. The impact this lie has on their marriage and the stage it set for their dramatic court battle is the central conflict of Big Eyes.
Similar to Waller, Alexander made his first career moves at USC and looks forward to having his movie screen at Norris Cinema Theatre on campus this coming week.
“I met my writing partner first day of freshman dorms. We were roommates. My movies can play for younger audiences or older audiences, but I’m curious to see how it’ll go with an all-young audience,” Alexander said.
Resembling Search Party in its fast-paced, adventure-themed plot line and Big Eyes’ emotionally stirring concept, Max is a family-friendly, adventure film that will be released this winter. It features Max, a bomb-sniffing military dog, who returns from service in Afghanistan with the painful memory of his handler’s death. In a heart-wrenching twist, he is adopted by the handler’s family, who live in Texas, and gives them support to cope with the trauma of death. The film was written by Sheldon Lettich and director Boaz Yakin , who spent nearly four years in the U.S. Marine Corps after his high school graduation. He went on to attend the American Film Institute’s Center for Advanced Film Studies as a Cinematography Fellow. Lettich has a background in writing well-received war movies, such as his co-authored Cold War drama Russkies (1987), which set the stage for Joaquin Phoenix’s success in acting.
“It’s a hero dog movie. It’s like Old Yeller. I can’t remember last time when there was a dog movie like this,” Lettich said. “We had a test screening a couple weeks ago, and it just went through the roof. Audiences went crazy over it. I’m really excited because my co-writer, also the director, pretty much made the movie that we wrote. There was no interference at all. It’s the movie we wanted to make.“
Max, in theaters on Jan. 30, 2015, has a star-studded cast, including Lauren Graham, Robbie Amell and Thomas Haden Church.
These are just three promising films to look out for in the winter season, but there are more than a dozen to pick from and enjoy during a relaxing Christmas break.

RL Grime, the Los Angeles-native electronic music producer/D.J., has made his name heard in the music scene with remixes, notably from the likes of Shlohmo, Benny Benassi and Rihanna, and EPs “Grapes” and “High Beams.” He has now finally released his debut studio LP, VOID. Collaborating with a slew of artists from different genres and musical styles, including Big Sean, Boys Noize and Djemba Djemba, RL Grime has created an album with a diverse soundset.

Focusing first on his tracks featuring other artists, the song “Danger (feat. Boys Noize)” is distinctly reminiscent of the dark atmosphere that pervades every Boys Noize song, and yet turns into a deep house track halfway through. It is very tastefully done, and continues to display this emerging subgenre present in nearly every electronic artist’s repertoire. “Kingpin (feat. Big Sean)” is a classic hip hop/trap-infused beat featuring some decent vocals by Big Sean. The slow, melodic measures of “Reminder (feat. How to Dress Well)” are perfect for a pair to dance to, with the beat refusing to recede at any time in the track. Grime allows Tom Krell enough room to shine, and yet displays his own flavors through just bass and beats. A beautifully composed piano riff in the background leaves a lasting impression. Lastly, among the tracks featuring other artists, “Valhalla (feat. Djemba Djemba)” displays some big room-style trap intertwined with the energy-driven percussion that Djemba Djemba is famous for.
As far as RL Grime’s solo endeavors in this album are concerned, “Core” has to be the track that stands out the most. The very first single that RL Grime debuted after the announcement of this album, it features some of the best basslines and 808 beats in the trap scene right now. This track is sure to be featured on sets of other D.J.s due to the impactful drop. Meanwhile, the melancholic and meditative melodies of “Monsoon” combined with hard bass and even harder drops produces a great track. The track has a continuous rhythm that hooks right from the first second. Another interesting track is “Julia,” a song that definitely does not fit its name. It’s full of garbled, hard synths and dark singing, revealing a somewhat new type of drum ‘n bass, but yet, the xylophone in the background calms this sonic onslaught.
“Site Zero/The Vault” contains some amazing and innovative percussion and bass work. Grime displays his technical expertise with crisp equalization and great tone coordination. This track is more of a journey than just a simple listen, and it’s also the longest track in the album, clocking in at seven minutes and 44 seconds. The song unexpectedly transforms into a tense tone with jarring screams, crescendoing up to a peak, before ending on a calm note.
“Scylla” is thoughtful, catchy and ripe with energy. This is RL Grime in his element, throwing out some hard trap that inspires. “Always,” the intro track in the album, is groovy, and features some great vocals. The most interesting, if not the most polished, track on the album is “Let Go (Interlude).” It functions very literally as a sort of break that Grime uses to create some thematic electronic tones and prepare audiences for the remainder of his album.  The final track on the album, “Golden State,” has a very glitchy sound, and serves to create an inspiring ending to Grime’s debut album.
RL Grime has masterfully created an album that features some classic beats, plays around with tropes in electronic music and covers a wide array of genres. It features some great artists who come from different cultures and types of music. Overall, this is a fantastic debut that establishes RL Grime as a major player in the electronic music scene, and adds yet another name to the list of great artists to come out of Los Angeles.

Bushy-tailed and doe-eyed, full of enthusiasm and brimming with energy, brother and sister Brandon and Savannah Hudson are focused and determined. They have a message and a voice, a vision and a goal. They aim to be the musical representative of a generation and yet create music that transcends age demographics. They’ve accumulated a breadth of influences and refuse to be confined by industry standards. Oh, and they’re 17 and 15.
All grown up · The duo of Brandon and Savannah Hudson began writing songs together as early as junior high school. Their family moved from Florida to Los Angeles two years ago to give the band a better chance at success. – Photo courtesy of The Heirs
“People didn’t really know what to expect. They thought they were getting into kiddie pop,” Brandon said. “Now that we’re older, I think we’re being taken more seriously.”
Older, meaning two or three years older than the Hudsons were when they first became serious about their career. Despite having to forage their way into the music scene (they had a couple of aunts and uncles who sang in the church choir, but no other direct influences), the brother-sister duo began singing at the ages of 5- and 7-years-old and writing songs together as early as junior high school.
When Brandon and Savannah decided that they wanted to realize their potential, then 15- and 13-years-old respectively, the Hudson family packed up their lives and made the transition from Florida to Los Angeles to give the band a proper chance to thrive.
“I think we were born knowing we weren’t going to have a normal life because [music] is what we love to do, but the fact that it’s all happening before our eyes is insane,” Savannah said. “A lot of people have dreams, but they’re just dreams. The fact that we’re pursuing ours is amazing.”
Brandon and Savannah have since toured Europe and the United States as The Heirs, accumulating fans and collecting inspiration for their first EP, produced by the same names that have worked with Beck, Sheryl Crow and Icona Pop.
Though their music screams indie-electro pop, the influences that have helped cultivate their sound are varied. The two listen to everything from hip hop to classic rock, 1980s pop to acoustic, but cite Fleetwood Mac and The Killers as important in helping instill an emphasis on vocal harmony from the former and the synth-rock band fusion from the latter.
“I think our intentions are always to think outside the box,” Brandon said. “We wanted to create something that was a blend of everything we like, everything we listened to but something that was different from what you’d usually hear. That’s what our music is about.”
The band itself stands for something much more ambitious. Its title, which has become emblematic for their message and reflective of their identity, came from a dream. Brandon unconsciously conjured an alternate world ruled by teenagers, one in which the youth controlled everything, made political decisions and were accountable for their future.
“I interpreted that as we are all The Heirs. We are all next in line for what comes next in life. We’re going to inherit everything that our previous generations have left behind for us,” Brandon said.
The “we” to whom he refers is all-inclusive; the siblings are adamant that there is no barrier between them and their fans and that they — the band and fans — collectively form The Heirs.
“It’s very political. The world is run by adults and we kind of felt looked down upon in a way, so with The Heirs concept, we wanted to show that we have just as much of a say as anyone else,” Brandon said. “It’s all about speaking out and having a voice, and that’s something we want to share with everyone.”
Both Brandon and Savannah speak with maturity and an air of confidence and assuredness that’s uncommon for young artists their age. They operate under the same vision, with the same goals and with such synchronization that they seem more like twins than siblings two years apart. They strive to create something that transcends their obvious demographic and defies the preconceptions that the larger world might have about them due to their age.
“Our biggest goal was to make music that was ageless so no matter how old we are and no matter what the situation is, our music can be identified with many other groups instead of judged just by our age,” Brandon said.
The duo describes themselves as writers and observers who are inspired by the behavior of their peers at parties, by the streets of Los Angeles, by the people they meet and the places they see while they travel on tour. In the studio, they might play a movie without sound and jot down thoughts they have, absorbing only the visual. More often than not, they’re inundated with a range of inspiration that stimulates ideas and concepts that they might not have experienced directly, but still triggers an emotional response.
The band dropped its first single from their debut EP, “Alright Goodnight,” a thumping, synth-saturated pop tune with layered instrumentation and alternating vocals that sounds upbeat on the surface but alludes to a deeper, heavier message and the first that they’ll make to the world after their first official EP release. It’s the first of a lot of material that The Heirs are anxious to release and share with their fans.
“We’re ready. We’re just waiting,” Savannah said. “We’re just waiting for the world to be ready.”
The Heirs are slated to release their first EP, “Introducing The Heirs,” in early 2015.

In a battle of ’SCs, the USC women’s basketball team played a close game against the No. 2 South Carolina Gamecocks on Saturday. USC fought hard throughout, but a late run by the Gamecocks gave them a 70-61 victory in Columbia, South Carolina, in both teams’ season opener.
Sound the horn · Senior forward Kaneisha Horn scored 11 points in USC’s game at No. 2 South Carolina on Saturday night. The Birmingham, Alabama, native averaged just 3.0 points per game last season. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
Senior forward Kaneisha Horn and freshman guard McKenzie Calvert led the Women of Troy (0-1) with 11 points each, while Horn also led the team with four steals. Sophomore forward Drew Edelman added 10 points on 5-of-5 shooting and five rebounds from the bench.
The Gamecocks (1-0) were led by center Alaina Coates’ 18 points and 13 rebounds, and guard Tiffany Mitchell contributed 18 points and four assists.
USC is now 0-3 against South Carolina all-time.
The opener pitted last year’s SEC regular season champion with last year’s Pac-12 Tournament champion, and the match lived up to the hype. Horn got the game started with a steal and a basket to give the Women of Troy a 2-0 start, and USC built a 7-2 lead after another basket from Horn and a three-pointer from senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama.
The Gamecocks responded with a quick 6-0 run to take an 8-7 lead, and chaos ensued.
The first half featured six lead changes and three ties, with the largest lead being South Carolina’s nine-point lead with 1:57 left in the half. The Gamecocks led or were tied for the final 8:24 of the half, and entered halftime with a 27-24 lead.
Both teams struggled on offense in the first half, as the Women of Troy only shot 24 percent from the field, compared to 36 percent for the Gamecocks.
Both teams broke it open in the second half, as USC and South Carolina improved to shooting 46 percent and 56 percent from the field, respectively.
The second half was mostly controlled by the Gamecocks, who held the lead from halftime until a layup from Calvert gave USC a 53-52 lead with 6:56 remaining. Their advantage was short-lived, as South Carolina would go on a 14-0 run over the next 4:41 to seal the win.
“I felt we missed a couple layups, and then turned the ball over a couple times in a two or three minute span,” said head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. “When you play a great team like South Carolina, you can’t make those mistakes because they make you pay for them. That was part of their 14-0, and we have to learn from that and learn how to finish games as strong as we start them.”
Overall, the Women of Troy shot 33 percent from the field compared to 46 percent for South Carolina. The Gamecocks forced 15 turnovers and 23 fouls, and USC forced 19 turnovers and 18 fouls.
“I think it gives our team more confidence,” Horn said about starting the year against the defending SEC champions. “We see that we’re better than people portray us. We’re not ranked, but for us to compete with that team, we should do really good this season. It motivates us all.”
Today, the Women of Troy will travel up to Davidson, North Carolina, to take on Davidson (0-1), who is coming off a 67-60 loss to Furman (1-0). Hannah Early led the Wildcats with 15 points and nine rebounds, Dakota Dukes added 12 points and nine rebounds and Mackenzie Latt earned a double-double (11 points, 12 rebounds).
The match-up, which begins at 4 p.m. PST, will be the first meeting ever between the Women of Troy and Davidson.
“We have to take what we did really well, and why we were in the game against the No. 2 team in the country,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We need to take those things, and continue to cultivate and build on those, and then fix some of the smaller things; the turnovers, the missed layups, the missed opportunities … This was the first game of our season, so we have a long way to go, and the key is to continue to grow.”
After USC returns from the Carolinas, the Women of Troy head to Long Beach to take on Long Beach State (1-0) on Friday, Nov. 21. They’ll play their home opener on Sunday, Nov. 23 at 2 p.m. against Fresno State (1-0).

The USC football team has the chance to win 10 games, sweep Notre Dame and UCLA and lay the groundwork for what could be the most explosive offense in college football next year. On the surface, it looks great, and 2014 seems like a solid debut season for coach Steve Sarkisian.
Reflecting on the season at this point seems to be dominated by looking at the year in two different lights. The eternal optimist looks at the season and says, had a couple more plays gone USC’s way, the team could have been in contention for the playoff. The pessimist says USC is a couple bounces from being a .500 football team. Though both of those are plausible scenarios, I don’t think that offers the most enlightening perspective on what the season means for the football program moving forward.
Due to the abridged nature of the season, luck and variability can play a role in determining the fortunes of a team. Ultimately though, enough small sample sizes combine to stabilize and neutralize “luck,” and the on-field product is rewarded in proportion to its merits. That’s why I think just using the eye test can sometimes be the most effective judge of a team’s performance. In terms of this, the USC football team has had an inconsistent on-field persona. They have had glimpses of the glory years with an offense rolling on all cylinders, while also going through the most frustrating of dry spells.
It’s obviously important to take into consideration the roster limitations due to sanctions and injury when looking at the team, as well as the fact that the young group is implementing an entirely new scheme on both sides of the ball. Understanding this, Sarkisian has done an admirable job this year.
But I can’t help shake the feeling that every game I have watched this year, USC has not reached its full potential. Even in the wins, there is a decrease in enjoyment because the team blows leads in the fourth quarter, and, with the exception of a few games, cannot seem to put four quarters of offense together. I have no idea if this should be attributed to a lack of depth or if it is more of a playcalling issue. Either way, Boston College notwithstanding, USC has been one of the best teams in the country through three quarters every game this year. In the fourth quarter, though, the repeated pattern of wilting is hard to figure out.
For the future of the program, one hopes that the sanctions and lack of depth are the primary factor in the drop off in performance in the fourth quarter. Whatever the case is, it has left me feeling like the USC team could accomplish a lot more this year with the type of drives like they had in the first quarter of the Cal and Utah games.
Redshirt junior Cody Kessler has developed into the most underrated quarterback in the country, and the array of wide receivers, tight ends and running backs at his disposal is second to none in the country. The offensive line is starting to click with the freshmen becoming more comfortable in their roles. Knowing this, it’s just maddening and frustrating to see them struggle so mightily in the latter stages of the game.
Just by using the eye test, it’s clear this team has greatness in its future. The hope is that the reason fans left frustrated after Cal and other games this year was because of depth, something that is easily fixed moving forward. If it is more of a system issue, it’s a lot more worrisome. I personally don’t believe this will be the long-term approach to football games with Sarkisian. I think the sanctions have been both a physical and mental hurdle this year, and once that is fixed the offense will run high octane for 60 minutes.
Even though the Trojans aren’t going to be competing in the playoff, beating UCLA and Notre Dame over the next two games has a significant impact on recruiting and the trajectory of the program. Though most reasonable evidence would indicate that the USC offense will go through periods of struggle in the two games, I am holding out hope that the extra adrenaline and passion will carry them through.
This Saturday is the Trojans’ chance to make most fans forget about the fourth quarter struggles. If USC is able to beat both the Bruins and Fighting Irish, a very plausible scenario, those fourth quarter issues will become a thing of the past.
Using the beloved eye test this year, I spot an overrated Bruins team that is ripe for defeat. Though they put together their most complete games of the season the last two weeks, their defense should not be able to match the speed outside the hashes. Forget the rest of the season, Saturday is what defines the year. It’s time for the Trojans to take back Los Angeles.

USC’s seniors came up huge on Senior Day for No. 3 USC (21-4, 6-2) up against No. 5 Cal (20-6, 4-4). Trojan senior drivers Marc Vonderweidt and Kostas Genidounias scored all but one of USC’s goals as the Trojans got a big win at home 7-6.

Cal came out strong with the first goal by attacker Aleksa Saponjic. Cal’s goalie Jon Sibley was playing tough, but Vonderweidt eventually broke through with a goal with some great passing by the Trojans. Near the beginning of the second frame, the Trojans and Vonderweidt began to gain momentum with another goal as they took their first lead of the game at 2-1. Cal’s Conor Neumann would tie the game up, but Genidounias would regain the lead for USC at 3-2.
Nonetheless, Cal’s Farrel South would again tie it up with under a minute left in the half. Trojan freshman two-meter Lachlan Edwards had a fair chance to score after that, but the score would remain 3-3 going into halftime. The third frame began as a stalemate, but Genidounias would eventually break through off a fast-break to give the Trojans a 4-3 lead. The man of the day, Vonderweidt came through big again to give the Trojans their first two-score lead at 5-3. Near the beginning of the fourth frame, Genidounias again scored, giving the Trojans a three-score lead at 6-3. It seemed that the game was over, but the Bears would not go away that easily. Cal fired away two straight goals by Saponjic and attacker Colin Mulcahy in a span of less than 30 seconds to decrease the Trojan lead to one goal. Freshman utility man Mihajlo Milicevic gave the Trojans a significant goal with 5:12 left to put the score at 7-5. But with 4:33 left in the game, Cal’s Mulcahy would score to again put the Trojan lead back at one goal. USC’s freshman goalie McQuin Baron and the defense came up huge in the end, not allowing Cal to score again. Cal had a chance at the very end to score but the shot was wide.
Vonderweidt, who scored a hat trick in his final game at Uytengsu Aquatic Center, believed it was a huge win for the Trojans.
“You wanna win every game you can,” Vonderweidt said. “It’s important. They’re a good team. They can definitely beat anybody. I think it set us much better going into MPSF, so this win is really important. If we would have lost, there would have been a lot of other complications. It would have been a tougher road. So this win was a good win.”
This win was also significant as a confidence-booster for USC. The Trojans struggled against Stanford and UCLA in the fourth quarter, but on Saturday the Trojans won in the final period. Senior driver Rex Butler said the struggle to come through in the end was something mentioned in practice.
“It’s something that we definitely needed to work on,” Butler said. “To be a championship team, you gotta be able to come out with a W in those close games, so having practice like this and getting that win in a close game is definitely going to pay dividends in the end.”
This Trojan team has a tendency to let opponents back in the game, which Butler believes has to do with pace of play.
“We just need to stay focused on defense,” Butler said. “I don’t necessarily think we let our guard down but I think we get up and we think we should go for some opportunities like in the fast break, and we end up taking some quick shots and that allows us to get beat on the way back. So I think just settling down more when we do get those leads just to take control of the pace of the game.”
Saturday was the last home game for USC’s seniors, but it was not much different from any other game for Butler.
“It didn’t really make a huge difference to me,” Butler said. “I just wanted to come out and get a win with these guys, so it was really just another day.”
Vonderweidt, on the other hand, tried to soak up Senior Day as much as he could.
“It’s awesome,” Vonderweidt said. “It’s my last home game here. I’ll probably remember this game for a long time, my last game here, in a stadium like this. It makes you want to play a fifth year, but I don’t have that.”
As the regular season ends for the Trojans, they step into MPSF tournament play this week in Long Beach. Butler feels good about his team at this point in the season.
“We got a lot of confidence going into tournament play,” Butler said. “Historically, we do pretty well at the conference tournament and we are at a better spot now than we were last year, so we are feeling pretty good.”
Last year, USC lost two of their last three games of the regular season, whereas this year, USC has won all of its last three games headed into the MPSF tournament and is continuing to improve, according to Vonderweidt.
“I think we’re starting to come together,” Vonderweidt said. “We’re starting to fix our mistakes which were huge in those close games, getting that extra block, getting that extra rebound, those are huge. Those add up.”

USC’s men’s basketball team opened its season with a 76-68 loss to Portland State on Saturday. The Trojans committed 23 turnovers in the game, 22 of which were lost by the starting five. The Trojans only forced four turnovers from Portland State, who capitalized off of the Trojans’ mistakes.
Flash of greatness · Freshman guard Jordan McLaughlin scored a team-high 19 points in his first game as a Trojan, but he also cost the team seven turnovers in his 33 minutes of play on Saturday night. – Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
 
Despite a significant  discrepancy in turnovers, the new members of the team shined for the Trojans and provided a glimpse of what is to come for this young team. Freshman point guard Jordan McLaughlin led the team with 19 points and six assists in his debut, but he also had seven turnovers. He showed off his ability to get to the hoop and seemed to develop good chemistry with his big men, constantly feeding them the ball down low.
McLaughlin was consistently the Trojans’ best player on the court, but he sat out key moments in the second half. Second-year head coach Andy Enfield noted that the point guard still played for most of the game and he was just monitoring his workload.
“When you play 33 minutes, it’s not like I took him out, but he gets tired like everyone else. We make the judgement of when he needs a blow,” Enfield said. “Of course we want him in the game, he does a lot of great things but he’s got to learn that he’s got to cut the turnovers way down but we’re proud of him. He’s a freshman [in his] first game, he’ll get better.”
Two other Trojans finished the game with double digits: freshman forward Malik Martin added 10 points and redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt scored 11 in their Trojan debuts.
Portland State was led by senior forward Tiegbe Bamba who scored 19 points and sophomore forward Braxton Tucker who added 16. The Vikings had five players score in double digits, including senior guard Tim Douglas who scored 14 and shot 4-6 from behind the arc.
The Vikings were stingy on defense, stealing the ball 10 times, and shot well from behind the arc at 44.4 percent. USC was only able to force four turnovers and only shot 33.3 percent from three, both factors proving to be the difference in the game.
USC led briefly in the first half after an 11-3 run put them up 23-22, but Portland State led for most of the game and went into the half up 39-32 after a 17-9 burst to end the first half. The Trojans were able to take a lead in the second half after a bucket from redshirt sophomore forward Darion Clark put them ahead 48-47, but the team never saw a lead the rest of the game.
The Trojans fought all through the second half and cut the deficit to one after a jumper from Reinhardt at 7:16, but then the Vikings went on a 10-0 run and never looked back.
Enfield started with a loss for his second straight season, and cited turnovers as the main reason for his team’s inability to beat a Vikings squad that went 17-15 last year, and 11-9 in Big Sky play.
“You’re not going to beat any team with 23 turnovers and you look and our starters had 22 of the 23,” Enfield said. “It’s not our bench coming in and turning it over. It was our players who we thought were our starting lineup, and they have to do a better job of taking care of the basketball.”
The Trojans were able to outshoot their opponent from the field, 53.2 percent to 39.1 percent, and outrebounded Portland State 43-25, but the turnovers kept them from winning the game.
Joining McLaughlin, Reinhardt and Martin in the starting lineup were returning sophomores, guard Julian Jacobs and forward Nikola Jovanovic. Jacobs only scored four points but added six rebounds, and Jovanovic scored six with seven boards, but also had six turnovers.
The bench was led by Clark, who scored eight points and grabbed five rebounds. Junior forward Strahinja Gavrilovic and freshman guard Elijah Stewart each added five points in the reserve role.
The Trojans will look to rebound from their loss in their second game on Monday against Tennessee Tech, a team that opened their season with an 83-29 beatdown of Piedmont International. In that game, junior center Dwan Caldwell and freshman forward Mason Ramsey led the Golden Eagles with 14 points. This will be the first meeting between the two teams. Tennessee Tech, much like USC, has a plethora of new faces, as they welcome in two transfer students and four freshmen. Tennessee Tech is led by head coach Steve Payne.
“We have to watch film and go easy on the legs and prepare for Monday night,” Enfield said. “Tennessee Tech’s a very good, experienced team; a lot like Portland State.”
Tipoff is scheduled for 8 p.m. at the Galen Center.

Without a doubt, Kim Kardashian “broke the Internet” last week with her nude debut on the front cover of Paper magazine.
Her blatant desire to gain more fame by exposing her body to the world via mass media is a valid reason why this form of expression in today’s culture must be regulated and censored. Recently, the series of racy photos has received some serious backlash and attention from various media outlets. More than that, though, the photos point to a culture that rewards exploitation and objectification of the female body.
Since similar photos of popular celebrities have been released in the past decade, it seems that this emerging shame-free culture has no regard for tasteful or creative behavior. Rather, this form of expression promotes a  means to push female empowerment and popularity that should be more strictly regulated and censored.
With the general populace buzzing about her racy cover photos rather than finding the appropriate means to regulate and censor such action, Kardashian is being rewarded for her behavior.
Individuals have bought into her actions by demanding more of her. She landed on Forbes’ Celebrity 100 list at #80, above Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep and powerhouse author J.K. Rowling, for raking in an estimated $28 million between June 2013 and 2014. She also made more cash from public appearances than she did for any of her television work.
Speaking of net worth in this culture almost completely obliterates the idea of self-worth. When Kardashian objectified her body on the front cover of Paper, she also contributed to the objectification and body shaming of millions of other girls. But, the blame cannot rest on Kim Kardashian alone. Recently, Victoria’s Secret released an ad campaign that similarly objectified body image by promoting the “perfect body.”
These two cases alone present an astonishing problem in today’s society. Young children who will represent our future generation are constantly surrounded by ads and magazines that promote the necessity to fit a certain body image.
This particular concept is famously noted in Tina Fey’s book Bossypants, in which Fey discusses a list of ideals that society has drilled into the minds of young women. In one of Fey’s excerpts, she compares the paradox for women to be expected to have Caucasian blue eyes and full Spanish lips. Fey further notes how Kardashian fits into these traits. “The person closest to actually achieving this look is Kim Kardashian, who, as we know, was made by Russian scientists to sabotage our athletes,” Fey said.
According to the Renfrew Center, an eating disorder facility, only 5 percent of women have the body type that advertisements portray as ideal. This statistic should concern the populace and initiate action towards censoring nude or racy images that objectify the human body.
Moreover, regulation of racy expression is not a case against feminism.
Kardashian doesn’t seem to be trying to prove that women were entitled to something more after giving birth — she was merely looking for a way to stay in the news after her pregnancy. Kardashian provides a quintessential example on the issue of body image. After giving birth, Kardashian reportedly practiced dangerous measures to lose weight because she knew a slim body would continue to contribute to her net worth.
Images similar to Kardashian’s in Paper are of great detriment to young women and must constitute a call for action. Female empowerment should not come from a woman flaunting a body that fits the ideals represented in the mass media — society must take measures to ensure this.
Rather than creating buzz about Kardashian’s actions, individuals must do more to secure censorship and regulation by policy implementation.

May the odds be ever in your favor, because several of 2014’s favorite words are entering a virtual Hunger Games. There’s a catch, though. Rather than bringing glory to its home district, the winning word will be the one with the most notoriety. On Nov. 12, Time magazine published its fourth annual word banishment poll. Among the bank of words and phrases, readers vote to eliminate for the next year are “sorry not sorry,” “basic” and, most concerning, “feminist.” The criteria, according to Time, are if the word elicits a reaction where you “definitely cringe,” “exhale pointedly” or succumb to a fit of sticking chopsticks into your ears. This yearly word-shaming that Time organizes, however, is silly and unnecessary, because slang words are important pop culture artifacts.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
I agree that, like everything else, words can be very annoying when overused. I roll my eyes at Instagram users who have replaced the notion of “love” with “bae.” (Though I have to agree that pizza is pretty bae.) And I might be committing treason against Los Angeles, but “kale,” a trend inundating social media and brandished by Time, is pretty much rabbit food. I don’t, however, employ 1984 tactics and try to eliminate common speech from everyday language. It’s an act akin to commanding people to stop using vowels or articles when talking. Words are the most obvious forms of expression, and sometimes the most appropriate articulation of what we know is a trite term. This trite term might not be polysyllabic SAT words or high-brow French phrases, but it derives from extensions of the world around us. Thus, these words are applicable.
Words sometimes expire and cycle out. Or sometimes they become engrained in our vernacular forever and are made an entry in the dictionary. The top words scathed by Time in years past include “OMG,” “YOLO” and “twerk.” While “YOLO” has become a face-palm version of carpe diem, “twerk,” along with “selfie,” was defined by the Oxford Dictionary Online. Either way, the elasticity of a certain word isn’t in the hands of Time. It is, however, in the hands of time — the tick-tock version. As these words fade out of our jargon, they are still tacked to a certain era. Time’s survey has no effect on ending the trend because it never completed what they set out to do, which is eradicate the word. The survey’s efforts, therefore, are pointless.
The giant elephant in the room is the alarming presence of “feminist” on this year’s list, which is leading the poll with 48 percent. In a sense, the inclusion signals positive progression. If “feminist” was included as one of the most hated words of the year, it shows it has presided our consciousness and dialogue. This illustrates the influence of the word, inspiring the conversations we should be having about equality. But the very thought of banning the word? That’s ludicrous. As an explanation for including “feminist,” Time included a statement on the list: “You have nothing against feminism itself, but when did it become a thing that every celebrity had to state their position on whether this word applies to them, like some politician declaring a party? Let’s stick to the issues and quit throwing this label around like ticker tape at a Susan B. Anthony parade.”
I agree “feminist” doesn’t belong on a “Hello my name is” nametag, but the fact that there are now more faces of feminism than just Gloria Steinem and Susan B. Anthony deserves to be celebrated. Feminist is a word that describes someone who believes that men and women should have equal rights. It’s a label that includes everyone, so the proliferation of this word can never become trite. The fact that Time included it as a word to be “banned” proves why their poll is futile — feminism will be remembered as having been revitalized in 2014, instead of being banished.
The magazine has since apologized for including “feminist” on the list  — as it should. Managing Editor Nancy Gibbs added a note, saying, “While we meant to invite debate about some ways the word was used this year, that nuance was lost, and we regret that its inclusion has become a distraction from the important debate over equality and justice.”
Putting aside the controversy of including “feminist,” the idea behind the list seems wrong to begin with. With the poll, Time might have intended to draw attention to how modern language has shifted from text talk to hashtag lingo, and how the context in which they’re used has transformed. Ultimately, though, it’s a bad decision on Time’s part to want to eradicate words, and especially the ones selected this year. Some words come and go, but we remember them as defining an era. Some might think of Time as being scholarly in this case, but to quote the popular ’90s phrase, as if!
