I love “Abbott Elementary.” That’s the entire column. Thank you for your time.
Of course, I’m kidding. But, to be fair, there is not much more to add to the conversation surrounding the show: Quinta Brunson is a legend, Jimmy Kimmel is a villain (which we’ve known for a long time) and teachers deserve so much better (which we’ve known for a very long time).
Still, with the premiere of season two and episode two airing  yesterday, it would feel inauthentic to write about anything else besides the lovable crew of Willard R. Abbott Elementary School. 
I like to consider myself somewhat of a comedy connoisseur. I do make it my job to keep up with the latest sitcoms. So, it would be wrong of me not to thank “Only Murders in the Building” and “Ted Lasso” for sticking by me these past years through some ups and many, many downs. (Though, I do need to dock points from “Only Murders” for sullying my peaceful viewing experience by bombarding me with the appearance of Amy Schumer playing an even worse version of herself. And look, I know it’s popular to hate on Amy Schumer, and I personally love to defend all women in comedy, but she makes it so hard sometimes.) 
However, even with my love for other sitcoms, I have to admit that the premiere of “Abbott” drew something out of me that had been missing from my life for years. I finally have a favorite show again, and boy, does it feel fantastic.
For the next 21 weeks, I actually have something to look forward to. Okay, I’m being dramatic. My life is full of fun and privileges such as concerts or seeing my parents that I can count down the days to. But “Abbott” provides something different —  a constant joyful anticipation that my life was sorely lacking. 
Sure, I did the whole “‘Euphoria’ Sunday” thing, but that was more to avoid the onslaught of TikTok spoilers rather than a strong yearning to watch the show exactly at 9 p.m. on a Sunday when I really needed to finish my English paper. 
In an age with a seemingly never-ending stream of new shows, it can feel like the only time people pay attention are when big, established names are there to back the project. Brunson was able to break through all the noise — creating ABC’s biggest sitcom since “Modern Family.” 
For good reason too — from genius lines like, “You know I’m a feminist. That’s why I let you pay for all my stuff,” to the fabulously hilarious Ava (Janelle James). The principal of “Abbott” may be the most iconic sitcom character since Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti) in “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” Her choice to name the school Wi-Fi “Bad Bitches Only” is poetic as only the baddest of bitches can truly appreciate her.  
Still, even with all of the brilliance that “Abbott” has produced — there is one thing that helps it truly stand out. Brunson put it best in a Twitter thread addressing a common criticism of “Abbott.”
“I just saw someone call Abbott Elementary ‘undramatic’ as a critique. I wonder if that has something to do with it being a 22-minute sitcom,” wrote Brunson. “‘people like this…but why…it is not sUCcceSion’ don’t break your brain, babe. turn on a Tarantino film and turn off the Abbott.” 
I don’t mean to diss the other shows I love, but sometimes sitcoms just aren’t easy to watch anymore. Take “Barry” for example. It’s very clever, but when I need to watch a comfort comedy, I don’t always want to go to the show with men literally getting strangled to death. Even “Ted Lasso,” the purest show I can think of, makes me cry every other episode. I guess it is necessary to get in touch with my emotions or whatever, but it isn’t always the best when I’m simply trying to scarf down my pasta in 15 minutes before running to class. 
“Abbott” is able to provide me with pure laughs, and a few sweet moments thrown in to warm my heart. And, when I want to procrastinate that English paper, at least it’s only 22 minutes.

Summer’s over and school is in session – this can only mean one thing; the coziest time of the year is in full swing. The air smells of pumpkin spice, leaves are turning orange and brown, and grocery store aisles are filled to the brim with ghouls and ghosts. It’s time to hang up the denim shorts and pull out the oversized sweaters as we round up the top five shows to kick off the autumn season.
“The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” – Netflix
Nothing says fall like witches and warlocks. Based on Archie comics, “The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” follows fifteen-year-old Sabrina Spellman, who lies between a world of magic and the mundane as a half-witch, half-mortal. With her father a complete warlock and her mother a mere human, “Chilling Adventures” follows Sabrina on the path toward her sixteenth birthday, where she must choose the life she wants to live. Sabrina battles between leaving her mortal friends and ordinary life behind and choosing to embrace her dark side. This dark coming-of-age story is perfect for October, with plot twists to send chills down your spine. 
“Pretty Little Liars” – HBO Max
Got a secret? In this bone-chilling mystery series, five girls, Allison, Spencer, Aria, Emily, and Hannah, rule the upper-class suburb of Rosewood, Pennsylvania. One night, during the summer before eighth grade, the friend group turns dark when Allison, the group leader, goes missing. A year after her disappearance, the rest of the girls are like strangers to one another — that is, until they begin receiving messages from the mysterious “A.” This anonymous entity somehow knows the girl’s darkest secrets. No one around them can be trusted, and everyone — even them — are suspects in Allison’s disappearance. Nothing brings people closer together thana secret, and these liars have tons of them. This cult classic series has all the suspense and horror to make every day seem like Halloween night.
“Over the Garden Wall” – HBO Max
This unusual miniseries follows half-brothers, Wirt and Gregory, who have found themselves lost in a mysterious and magical forest called The Unknown. Wirt and Gregory must navigate The Unknown while avoiding The Beast, a creature on the hunt for lost children. As the adventure continues, the stakes climb higher, introducing a number of characters and creatures that aid the brothers in their trek home. “Over the Garden Wall’s” impressive artwork and animation immerses the watcher in a mysterious forest journey. This series encompasses that whimsical and fantastical feeling the season brings to every autumn-lover out there. 
“Agatha Raisin” – Amazon Prime
Murder, mystery, and mischief! This comedic mystery follows Agatha Raisin, a middle-aged PR genius, as she abandons the daily London grind for the cozy Cotswolds village of Carsely. The frustrated primadonna has sold her successful public-relations firm in Mayfair with hopes of early retirement. Agatha wants nothing more than to kick up her feet and enjoy the village life, that is, until her once friendly neighbors turn murderous. Agatha Raisin goes from PR to PI in this British series. With four 90-minute episodes in the series, Agatha Raisin is the perfect show to snuggle up in bed and enjoy the contrast of quaint village life with the suspense-filled mystery. 
“Gilmore Girls” – Netflix
This list wouldn’t be complete without well-known autumn classic “Gilmore Girls.” The show focuses on the dynamic mom-and-daughter duo Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. Lorelai, cut off from her well-off family after having Rory as a teenager, planted her roots in the small town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, where she balances working as a hotel manager while also trying to raise Rory on her own. When Rory gets accepted into a prestigious high school in Hartford, the Gilmore Girls have to seek financial help from two people Lorelai never wanted to come crawling back to. Her parents. Because the series takes place in autumn and winter, it has seven seasons of freshly fallen leaves, countless scenes of endlessly filled coffee pots, and pumpkins on every surface, making “Gilmore Girls” the perfect show to binge-watch in the fall.

This past weekend, we had the opportunity to watch another exciting set of college football matchups with numerous upsets and thrilling endings such as Texas A&M-Texas Tech University, Clemson University-Wake Forest University and more. The slate of electric football games included USC’s matchup against the previously undefeated Oregon State in which the Trojans avoided the upset, winning 17-14 thanks to their relentless defense and the offense’s late-game heroics. 
However, a lot of people did not get the opportunity or were unwilling to watch this game and its dramatic ending for two reasons. The first is that the game started at 6:30 p.m., which works for us here on the West Coast, but for Trojan fans on the East Coast, the 9:30 p.m. start time makes watching the game a late-night commitment. Nevertheless, late games are a normal thing. They happen commonly in other sports such as baseball and basketball. But when it comes to two undefeated teams in the conference with a recent history with one another, it was surprising to see it be scheduled for such an inconvenient slot.
The second factor is even more alarming. The game was televised on the Pac-12 Network, which is not available on a number of TV providers such as YouTube TV, DirectTV and more. Unfortunately, this results in people having to follow the game through other methods such as ESPN’s Gamecast feature, illegal streams or the nostalgic option of radio broadcasts. 
College football fans’ distress about airing the game on the Pac-12 Network was well-voiced on social media.
“Just realized that No. 7 USC plays a really good, really fun Oregon State team… on Pac-12 Network. So I can’t watch it. Nor can most of the country,” tweeted Shehan Jeyarajah, a CBS Sports writer. 
“When the big game of the night is on the Pac-12 Networks, I like to gather my entire family around a gigantic radio in the living room like FDR is delivering a fireside chat.” said Rodger Sherman, a sports writer for The Ringer. 
It begs the question, who even decides what games will be aired on what network in the college football world? Is it the conference? 
Well, the answer actually comes down to the media channels themselves, such as Fox and ESPN. They negotiate which games they will air on their respective networks. So, it’s unfair to place the entire blame on the Pac-12 Conference for the fact that the USC-Oregon State game got played at such a late time and inaccessible channel. Still, on their end, they need to make the Pac-12 Network available to more providers so that fans all over the nation can easily watch their favorite teams. 
But the larger issue at hand remains that the conferences should have more say in what games get to be shown prominently. Exposure to Pac-12 football is already limited, and not putting some of your top teams like USC in primetime spots hurts them even more. Although Pac-12 is known for its “Pac-12 After Dark” games, its viewership is not the best because of these famed late start times. 
Choices like these over the years are what made USC and UCLA decide to go to the Big Ten, as there will be greater media coverage with better time slots, which means more national exposure and recruiting attention. Additionally, with the stronger TV deals through the Big Ten with broadcasters such as FOX, CBS and NBC, both schools are looking to make around $80 million to $100 million per year compared to now where they make around $20 million to $21 million per year. 
Although USC and UCLA are already leaving, it is crucial for the Pac-12 to start thinking about getting more power in what games should be placed front and center every week to sustain the future of their conference.

Before the start of the 2022-23 college football season, many wouldn’t have thought that USC’s defense would be winning them games. With a flashy new quarterback in sophomore Caleb Williams and an onslaught of transfer receivers and running backs, the offense was in the spotlight, and for good reason, as they have been playing lights out — for the most part.  
However, Saturday’s matchup against the Oregon State Beavers served as a defining game for a defense that has surprised college football fans and pundits alike. Amidst the offense’s questionable performance, the defense kept Oregon State to 14 points and had 4 interceptions.
“We had to find different ways to win tonight,” said Head Coach Lincoln Riley in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “It ended up being kind of a slugfest… Of course — our defense, the four turnovers, the huge stops, closing the game — you just can’t say enough about how we played defensively. You just can’t. And a lot of guys stepped up, played through a lot of things. It was a gutsy performance by our defense.”
Even with an offense as physical as Oregon State’s, the Trojan defense was able to keep the Beavers to only 167 receiving yards and 153 rushing yards with only one defensive penalty while Oregon State committed six.
“I was just happy with how we responded as a team,” said senior inside linebacker Shane Lee. “We were put in a tough situation that we haven’t been in before, and I think we responded in a great way. We came together, we pushed each other.”
Lee, who played for the University of Alabama for three seasons, transferred to USC in the spring. He praised fellow transfer and sophomore inside linebacker Eric Gentry’s play over the last four games, particularly against Oregon State where Gentry recorded his first interception of the season. 
“[His size is] definitely unique, and I’ve never played with somebody with that kind of length,” Lee said. “It’s new but it’s cool to see. It’s fun to play with him.”
Gentry stands at 6-foot-6 and showed his athleticism with his second quarter interception, which bounced off of his hands once before Gentry secured the pick. 
“Normally that height is reserved for the edge, so to be able to move like he can and have some of the instincts that he has as a young guy is pretty impressive,” Riley said about the Trojans’ lead tackler earlier this month on the football teams’ Trojan Live program. 
The defense carried the team while the offense appeared to be struggling before putting together an 11-play, 84-yard game-winning drive. The team didn’t score a touchdown in the first half after starting the season averaging 4 touchdowns in the first half across their first three games.
On the other hand, Gentry, redshirt freshman defensive back Ceyair Wright, redshirt junior defensive back Max Williams and redshirt senior defensive back Mekhi Blackmon all made interceptions for USC, killing Oregon State drives that, at times, threatened to put victory out of the Trojans’ reach. Defensive coordinator Alex Grinch was pleased with his unit’s showout. 
“I thought that guys did a nice job. Just looking at their faces and the response to the way the game went,” Grinch said. “I was really proud of them that way, but you can only do that if you’re performing that way. And so, I was certainly pleased overall.”
With an average of 3.5 forced turnovers per game and at least 4 four takeaways in three of the 4 four games played, the team’s defense is one of the best in the nation. Facing an Arizona State team that has already committed 46 turnovers this season, the Trojans could be poised to add to their season total. 
USC is now ranked No. 6 in the nation after their win over Oregon State. And with an offense that has shown its incredibly high ceiling and a defense that has surpassed expectations thus far, the Trojans could continue to climb the rankings.

This article contains brief discussions of mental health.
In a briefing Tuesday with the Daily Trojan, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman confirmed that there have been no new reported monkeypox cases in the last two weeks.
“We did have a handful of cases at the end of August, beginning of September,” Van Orman said, “but nothing recently; and we’re seeing that across [Los Angeles County] that cases are actually plateauing and maybe even declining.”
While Van Orman did not provide specific numbers — she said in a briefing Sept. 6 that Student Health would not publicize such data — the statement is consistent with national trends as reported by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, which delineate a continued decline after peaking Aug. 22 at 916 new cases. 
As the monkeypox outbreak dwindles, vaccine supplies are also improving and thus more widely accessible: USC Pharmacies opened its own site Sept. 17 near Dodger Stadium, where it administers immunizations against monkeypox, influenza and coronavirus at no cost.
Van Orman said the University is also “actively evaluating” potential administration of monkeypox vaccines on campus. In the meantime, Van Orman encouraged people to get vaccinated at other sites.
“There’s lots of other community vaccine sites where people can just walk in and get their first dose, or if they’ve gotten their first dose, their second dose,” she said. “We really encourage people to be vaccinated if they fall into one of the risk groups and they have not yet been vaccinated.”
Van Orman reported 113 new coronavirus cases for the week beginning Sept. 18 — including positive tests at Student Health and at-home tests — a decrease of 18.7% compared to the 139 reported cases from the week prior. Trends at USC continue to follow that of L.A. County, where the seven-day case rate according to the CDC fell to 108.62 on Monday, a 16.8% decrease from the previous week.
“We’re just reminding people: this is a great time to get your [coronavirus] booster and your flu shot, so that we can continue good health for the semester,” Van Orman said, noting that Student Health plans to open booster and flu shot clinics at a date yet to be announced.
With midterm season on the horizon and yet another heat wave baking Southern California, Van Orman discussed coping strategies for each. The most important self-care strategy ahead of exams, she said, is sleep. 
“We can talk about exercise and relaxation and eating well, but none of it matters if you’re not sleeping,” Van Orman said. “What we find that a lot of people do, with the cyclic nature of school, is to not sleep a little for several nights and then sleep a lot; and that really is very bad for our mental health. It actually affects our cognitive function: people perform better, including academically, when they get regular sleep.”
Van Orman advised against excessive napping, warning it could disrupt “nighttime sleep patterns and lead to insomnia.”
“That’s a very common pattern we see with people: you get up early, you go to class, you come back, you sleep all afternoon, and then you wake up and work late into the night,” Van Orman said. “And that is something that can really impact people’s mental health.”
Student Health offers the Sleep Well Workshop, a workshop on sleep hygiene, available through the MySHR portal.
Other self-care strategies, according to Van Orman, include staying physically active, eating regularly, utilizing available resources for feelings of overwhelming or paralyzing anxiety and seeking professional help — including through the 24/7 USC Student Health line at (213) 740-WELL (9355) — if experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide.
Effects on health can be further compounded by the new heat advisory issued throughout Southern California. Though less severe than the last wave early September, Van Orman warned that heat stroke and heat exhaustion are still possible.
While heat stroke is a medical emergency caused by “acute overheating in the moment,” heat exhaustion is gradual and can build over several days, Van Orman said.
“After day two or day three … they may just start feeling a little fatigue, they might be feeling nauseous — just not feeling well,” she said. “The best way to counteract that is making sure they’re staying extremely well-hydrated, really increasing their fluid intake, and then making sure that … they are spending some hours indoors.”

The Thornton School of Music will be offering a master’s degree in teaching popular music, with enrollment starting Fall 2023. Intended for K-12 teachers — or those studying to become K-12 teachers — the program aims to diversify their skillsets with knowledge on how to teach popular music.
Beatriz Ilari, associate professor of music education, said that interest in teachers who could incorporate popular music into their curriculum has been steadily growing, inspiring the school to form a master’s program in the subject.
“I get emails every week with requests [from schools] for teachers, and most of them involve some form of popular music,” she said. “And I often have to say, we don’t have a lot of folks in that population, we need to get more.” 
The master’s popular music program grew out of the Popular Music Performance undergraduate program, which has been running for 15 years. Thornton Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Brian Head said that the positive response to the undergraduate program further encouraged the school to create a master’s program.  
“There was kind of an avalanche of [reflection from alums of the program,] reflecting on the fact that this doesn’t exist anywhere else,” Head said. “Once they got [into the program], they realized that this was making [them] more powerful, making [them] more versatile [and they] were able to reach out in so many more ways than [they] were before.” 
Head said that when the demand for popular music teachers began to rise, the school felt as though it had something to offer. 
“We’ve been teaching [popular music] over the last dozen years, we’ve gotten better at it, figured things out, introduced new ideas, new repertoire, new ordering of classes, refined our pedagogy,” Head said. “We’ve gone through this process more systematically than almost anyone else has in a collegiate setting.”
Chris Sampson, an associate professor of popular music and the architect behind the program, said that it is not intended to replace classical high school ensembles such as band, choir and orchestra; rather, it aims to provide a more diverse and culturally responsive set of options for students who don’t naturally gravitate towards classical instruments. After all, while classical music and its respective instruments can be enjoyed by anyone, its origins are distinctly European. Teaching popular music, on the other hand, allows students to explore genres that come from all across the globe. 
“Instead of us really bringing exclusively a Eurocentric-type approach to the students, whether that’s their background or interest, we’re able to, in popular music, respond if they’ve got a very specific interest,” Sampson said.  “I’m a classically trained musician myself, I know the value of it, I absolutely love it. So, none of this is intended to replace that, it’s more like, ‘let’s add all of this in.’” 
The program is also built on the understanding that what music is considered “popular” will forever shift and change. Head said that the master’s program is intentionally a “zoomed out” approach to music, so that new styles of music can be included as they rise into popularity. 
“The degree requirements leave a lot of room for the repertoire to evolve,” he said.  “And we would absolutely expect that.”
According to Sampson, to further understand this program, it is essential to know how it goes about defining popular music. Sampson said the class is not primarily focused on how to teach the Billboard Top 100 — instead, it encourages teachers to look at what’s popular with specific kids in specific communities, and to build a curriculum around that. 
“We’re able to, in popular music, respond if [students] have a very specific interest in say, hip-hop, mariachi, Latin pop styles or rock styles,” he said. “We’re able to provide a pathway to music education for music that [students] listen to in their homes, with their families.” 
The master’s program does not intend to teach the students who enter it everything there is to know about these genres of music. Rather, it intends to give teachers enough tools to go into a classroom, engage in a dialogue with students to find what they are interested in and build a curriculum around these passions, regardless of expertise.
“It calls upon the teacher to go out of their comfort zone,” said Sampson. “By having these conversations, a student might take [their teacher] into a style or musical tradition that they’re not familiar with. An instructor has to be able to say, ‘I’m not familiar with that style — let’s go. Let’s learn it together. Let’s figure it out.’”

Every so often, in the least egocentric way possible, I feel like life is harder for me than it is for a lot of people. That’s disregarding the more complicated parts of my identity that shape my experiences, such as being a first-gen college student and the massive hulking weight it imposes, being a woman and the additional societal weight that imposes, family stuff (much too big of a can of worms to say much more) and then being Black on top of all of that. 
Somehow, rather than all the much larger issues that face me and the world at large (there are too many to list), the fear and anxiety I feel interacting with other people still feels like the most pressing issue facing society right now. 
Sorry to the very important and, of course, very pressing real-world problems. I’ll refocus after I finish self-reflecting. Cool?
Sometimes I feel like I can only speak and/or make friends when I’m in a situation where I’m forced to do so. It’s easy when I literally cannot escape the people around me, but when I’m at a party or in a classroom full of people I’ve never met, I lose my edge and immediately turn in on myself. That pesky little brain of mine forces me to overthink every intake of breath, every sigh, every laugh, every infinitesimal head movement until I feel like I’ve ruined every social encounter I’ve ever had and I find myself scurrying after my friends so I’m not forced to make conversation and inevitably put my foot in my mouth.
Don’t get me wrong, I have my moments — usually while I’m inebriated — but it’s just so incredibly frustrating how easily it seems to come to other people. I’ll see my friends make conversation with anybody — a bartender, a person sitting near us in a cafe, a random student in their class — and watch in awe. 
In all my social interactions, I’m measuring myself up against others. Am I laughing too much? Too loud? Am I talking enough or not at all? Do I seem too eager? Too interested? Not interested enough? It can all just feel so exhausting that sometimes I’ll end up not speaking at all. I wish it was easier — I try to pretend it’s easier. I can’t count the mornings I’ve woken up promising myself that I’d try harder, be more open, less cagey, not keep so much to myself. And nearly every time I find myself doing more of the same — sitting away from my peers, not speaking up when people are talking about something I care about or even not raising my hand in class because I’m too nervous to share my answers with the whole class. 
But, here’s the thing, I wasn’t shy when I was a kid. I didn’t care about taking up space. I went on stage with my dad once at a club he was performing at and grabbed the mic to perform while he held me in front of a crowd. I’d wave at strangers, smile at them and it was all so painfully easy. I can’t remember what the precise turning point was, but I can tell you this much:  Self-awareness is soooooo overrated. As someone constantly noticing even the tiniest action they’re making at any given moment, I desperately wish I was able to skip that part of the human experience. I wouldn’t have to worry about any of this if I could. Even now, I’m wondering if what I’m saying makes sense, if it matters or if I should just scratch the whole thing. 
Part of me wants to blame it on the digital era and the insane amount of visibility we place on ourselves from such a young age. I remember when I first got my Instagram account around the age of 11. I posted a picture of a Bubba Gump cup that lit up and quickly became one of my prized possessions, yet now I can’t imagine posting a picture that in any way detracts from my carefully curated and crafted enigmatic internet persona. 
Somehow, this unprecedented amount of access we now have into each other’s lives — which should make communicating easier — has made it infinitely more difficult. We should probably close out our TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter accounts, but then how would we know far too much and simultaneously too little about people who aren’t even a part of our lives anymore?
Talking should be easy. It’s precisely what makes humans so special. Our amazing, diverse, complicated, elaborate means of communication is incredible, but it can also be so awfully, terrifyingly, surprisingly hard. So, if you see me in a class and I seem aloof, thorny (like a cactus as I was told once), cold or withdrawn, I promise I do want to talk to you. I’m just scared.

More than 427,000 undocumented students attend higher education nationwide, comprising 2% of all students who attend higher education in the United States, according to a College Campaign report.  However, the number of undocumented students who graduate is much less than that, as they face social, emotional and legal barriers during their academia. Despite this fact, through the years, colleges have shown support for these students by creating resource centers that provide services for their time in academic guidance. These services provide Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals renewal, internships, scholarships and graduate school planning, which many undocumented students have found to be a struggle in searching for as many require social security or U.S. citizenship. 
With students being heavily impacted by underrepresentation and acknowledgment by their administration, many UC schools have implemented these centers on their campuses to further expand inclusivity and resources. Schools such as UC Davis, UC Berkeley and UCLA have centers that provide academic guidance, financial aid guidance, legal services, health counseling and employment and career advancement — all services which Improving Dreams, Education, Access and Success at USC proposed in the fall 2019 to President Carol Folt and former vice president for Student Affairs Winston Crisp. 
The undocumented experience for students is one that is not discussed in rooms as much as it should be. Filling out financial aid and the constant stress of figuring out how Congress will continue with DACA are constantly on the minds of students. When schools implement a center for a focus on supporting these students, they are crafting a solution and inclusivity in resources. 
“The AB540 and Undocumented Student Center at UC Davis takes the edge off my fall quarter stress,” Joshua Melendez, an undocumented freshman student at UC Davis, said. “I know as a student I can take advantage of their resources through tutoring, advising, financial aid advising, mental health initiatives, etc. The center promotes inclusivity and helps students foster a sense of belonging.” 
Recently, the reminder to put a on my hold social security was brought to my attention by a club that seeks a challenge in including undocumented students. IDEAS is an organization on campus that aims to create a safe environment for undocumented students and allies. For the past years, they have hosted UndocuGraduations — a special ceremony for undocumented students graduating from USC. Their support for these students involves addressing political updates surrounding immigration, DACA, Temporary Protected Status, informational sessions and taking action on the current climate of immigration support. 
The issue is that there is not enough discussion and acknowledgment of this issue.Although we have cultural organizations, there is not a person within the team who has a full understanding of how to support these students and answer their concerns outside of the students who are struggling themselves.
Stress and fear are the familiar emotions undocumented students and families experience, the target of change in federal immigration protection has risen over the past few years. In early 2020, the U.S. and many other countries were hit tremendously by the coronavirus pandemic. The barriers to financial support during the pandemic were one many families tried to overcome. During this time, DACA was up for removal, and over 300,000 TPS holders were targeted for an overturn. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement threatened to deport international students if they did not attend in-person classes. 
While the Trojan community showed their support for these students by taking initiative to ensure that international students could safely reside in Los Angeles, this support should not only be shown when the world shuts down. The University has shown its support for students when policies negatively impact the Trojan community, what is needed is a resource that provides consistent and full attention to Dreamers who struggle on a daily basis, not just those who struggled during the pandemic. 
A proposal crafted by the IDEAS executive club board was sent twice to both Folt and Crisp after their 2019 meeting about the concern. They received a response solely from Crisp on April 16, 2020, and there has yet to be a response from Folt on next steps. Even with this response, there wasn’t much progress toward next steps. They also mentioned the First Generation Plus Success Center’s inclusivity to undocumented students, implying that it should also serve as the “undocumented center.”
The club was advised to provide numbers of how many undocumented, TPS and DACA students they support in order to gain more attention and signatures for their cause. While this may be true, to ask every member of the club about their current citizenship status is a massive invasion of privacy. The University and those who want to help must understand that when students remain silent about their citizenship status, it isn’t because they don’t want help — it’s because it is the safest and most comfortable way to manage the question.
As an undocumented student, I appreciate the efforts and the steps made to recognize this issue on campus, but it does not end there. USC has a dedicated web page for undocumented students, although the website is outdated and does not provide up-to-date information on the current stance of DACA. 
The Gould School of Law also has an immigration clinic to assist USC’s undocumented students and families. Students can also find opportunities through the Undergraduate Student Government’s work study alternative for undocumented students. But there has yet to be a consistent and designated place to which undocumented students can turn to. If the “Trojan Family” truly exists, USC needs to step up and ensure that all of its student feel emotionally and physically safe on campus, including undocumented Trojans.
On the off chance that someone from the Board of Trustees, USC Student Affairs or even President Folt herself is reading this: Undocumented Trojans need action and recognition from the University. We are present, we struggle and we cannot be left in the shadows to fend for ourselves any longer.
