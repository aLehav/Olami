Dozens of students leaped back in time to 1992 on Wednesday to explore how Los Angeles erupted in riots under severe racial and economic stress.
USC Student Affairs’ Project ReMiX presentation of LA Explodes examined the underlying causes leading up to the ’92 riots through a video and panel offering first-person perspectives.

Rachel Shannon, a rookie Los Angeles Police Department officer when the riots broke out, recalled her response to then-Chief Daryl Gates’ orders for officers to stay off the streets. The riots broke out when LAPD officers were acquitted for the beating of Rodney King, which was videotaped and widely broadcast.
“I wasn’t afraid,” said Shannon, now an officer with Beverly Hills Police Department. “We could hear screaming, we could hear gunshots and I remember hearing many of us asking, ‘How come we can’t go?’”
The riots lasted less than a week, but when the dust settled, more than 50 people had died, more than 4,000 were injured and the estimated overall property damage was $1 billion.
“I couldn’t understand it,” Shannon told the students. “People were destroying their city, destroying their communities.”
The post-panel discussion gave students an opportunity to analyze modern urban race relations, today’s economic woes and whether Los Angeles is in imminent danger of erupting into another violent protest.
“[Many] USC students weren’t born when the L.A. riots took place,” said Sumun Pendakur, assistant director of Asian Pacific American Student Services. “It’s so important for students to learn and address the economic impact and realize how many lives were lost and property that was destroyed.”
Pendakur said the general assumption is that the ’92 riots came from black-Korean conflict, but that economic injustice and racial inequality spurred the conflict.
“Race and economics go hand-in-hand,” Pendakur said. “It’s about access to resources, who controls resources and this country’s 400-year history of racial and economic injustice.”
Amanda Smith, a third-year USC law student, said economic inequality threatens Los Angeles’ social stability even though racial tensions between minority races have relaxed since 1992.
“Unemployment is rising. and it’s highest among minorities,” Smith said. “It’s important to address this and other issues so we make sure history doesn’t repeat itself.”
The Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, APASS and El Centro Chicano founded Project ReMiX in 2008 to address multi-racial issues in USC and in the surrounding urban communities.
About 14 percent or about 2,400 current undergraduates check more than one ethnicity box when applying to USC, according to Pendakur.
Though Pendakur said conditions have dramatically improved for multi-racial students since 1992, work still needs to be done.
“Diversity is a strength but can also be a challenge when services are unavailable and resources are unequal,” Pendakur said. “Multi-racial students face a particular set of challenges in our society.”
Minhee Ji, a freshman majoring in East Asian studies and international relations, said she has never encountered racism living in Los Angeles.
“I personally have not faced discrimination or any big challenges in America,” Ji said. “I’m comfortable. There are lots of Asians here and people understand you better.”
Pendakur said diversity in Los Angeles and at USC is a key strength, but it can also present challenges.
“USC has great structural diversity, but we need instructional diversity,” Pendakur said. “It’s the job of the classrooms and programs like these to encourage students to interact with people of different backgrounds so we can understand different cultures.”
Am I prejudiced?. Hell yeah. Do I express it openly?. Hell no. Do I burn crosses on people’s lawns, or hang nooses, or tatt swastikas on my body? Hell nah. You don’t have to be an extreme racist to be racist. Everyone is racist to some degree. Do I condone it?. Yep….It’s human nature. Are people who say things like “I’m not racist; I got black, brown, yellow peeps as friends” racist?. Hell yeah! People who say they’re not racists are ironically the biggest racists. 
The realistic approach to race relations isn’t “let’s all hold hands and sing kum ba yah.” No, it’s more like, “I don’t agree with your cultural diffrences, but as long as you don’t bother me, I can tolerate them.” We don’t have to see eye to eye on everything….
I wish we can be more open and honest about the people who decided to riot and kill people. All these discussions make it seem their actions were partially justified. If we really want to pander to the lowest common denominator in society we will quickly turn into a 3rd world country – which LA already feels like right now. Let’s raise the intelligence level and raise the bar for how people should behave in a civilized society. people who whine and complain about being disenfranchised are also the ones acting like animals in school and not learning any employable skills. If you are lazy physically and intellectually then what do you expect?
It sounds like it was a great presentation.  I’m glad that 20 years later the new generation is re-examining what happened.  I was going to USC at the time.  I drove by the areas affected and took lots of pictures.  It was quite eery.  I still have the pictures.  My son is at USC now.  The surrounding areas seem better now.  Thanks for posting the article.
I was a student living in College-Uni dorms dutring the ’92 riots, now I live near campus in West Adams. I would have LOVED to hear the ReMiX interpretation of the events that transpired.  I can tell you one thing for sure: it was scary to be on campus that first night, but DPS really handled the situation well.  The fact that people were still trying to study for finals while we could all smell smoke, and hear sirens and gunshots was insane!
Living in NYC during it’s Crown Heights Riots, I watched in a “Deja Vu” Moment when the 1992 LA Riots took place.
With the LAPD off-the-streets there were TV Images of Korean Shopowners Firing (weapons) at would be Looters. So naturally I was apprehensive when I stayed at a Hotel in Koreatown during USC 2010 Parents Weekend. I found the Neighborhood and the Area around USC very nice and pleasant.  But I still wonder (w/ such divide-siveness in Politics) whether we will suffer another Breakdown in Governmental Administration/Responsibilities?

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety Daily Incident Log between Tuesday, Feb. 28, and Wednesday, Feb. 29.
View Roundup 03-01 in a larger map
Crimes against a person
At 12:28 p.m. on Feb. 28, a student reported that another student punched him in the face several times during an altercation outside Sigma Chi fraternity. The student did not report the incident on Feb. 22, when it occurred, and he sought medical treatment on his own.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 1:30 a.m. on Feb. 29, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect hitting the door of a university tram with a skateboard and detained him for investigation. A check of the suspect’s name revealed an outstanding warrant and he was arrested.
at 10:19 p.m. on Feb. 28, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect panhandling at Subway and, when they contacted him, he became irate and began yelling at them. The suspect continued to yell at the officers when they advised him against trespassing on university property and requested that he leave the premises. He eventually complied and the officers cleared the scene.
At 7:10 p.m. on Feb. 28, DPS officers responded to a student who sustained a possible broken nose when another student accidentally struck him in the face while they were rehearsing a fight scene in the Physical Education Building. The student was applying ice to his nose when the officers arrived. He was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital for medical treatment.
At 2:17 p.m. on Feb. 28, a staff member reported that she encountered a suspect who was prowling in her office in the George Finley Bovard Administration Building and discovered that he had tampered with her briefcase. The staff member reported the incident about 30 minutes after it occurred, so DPS officers were unable to conduct a search for the suspect. No property was removed.

Facebook could successfully be used as a tool in determining a person’s potential career and academic success, according to a study released in February’s Journal of Applied Social Psychology.
“Social Networking Websites, Personality Ratings and the Organizational Context: More Than Meets the Eye?”, released by Northern Illinois University, the University of Evansville and Auburn University, claims word use, attire and photographs found on any Facebook profile could be used to evaluate personality information.
Analyzing the Big Five personality traits — neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness — is one suggested method used to evaluate the potential success of prospective employees, the study said.
Jay Tucker, associate director of strategic marketing and communications at the Marshall Institute for Communication Technology Management, said using the Big Five is one of several ways employers assess potential employees.
“When it comes to hiring, there are a number of theories regarding how best to identify a great hire, but many of them identify three basic kinds of attributes: work experience, skills and talents, and personality or disposition,” Tucker said. “There are a number of ways to assess a person’s personality profile, but the study shows that you could use a person’s social media footprint to paint a personality picture.”
Karen North, program director of the Annenberg Program on Online Communities, said an issue with using social media to evaluate prospective employees is that it assumes potential employees are technologically literate.
“[The study] assumes that the real self isn’t a social self, overlooking the fact that whether or not you are receptive to social cues depicts who you are,” North said. “Identity is constructed; we are seeing the ‘them’ they choose to present. It’s like plastic. It can be changed instantly.”
Estelle Berger, a freshman majoring in international relations, said her Facebook does not necessarily reflect her personality.
“Just by being able to untag or tag yourself in pictures gives you complete control over how people perceive you,” Berger said. “I definitely take part in creating a very contrived self-portrait that might not necessarily reflect all of the aspects of my character.”
Michael Peha, a senior majoring in music industry, said though he does not customize his Facebook profile, it accurately depicts his characteristics.
“I love theater, music and most avenues of entertainment and that is usually what shows up on my profile in Facebook,” Peha said. “I’ve never thought of customizing my Facebook to tailor to a specific aspect of my personality.”
Though Tucker said few companies attempt to access potential employees’ secured Facebook accounts, students should always be conscious about what material is privately and publicly available on their account.
“While I don’t think that many companies would try to hack a person’s Facebook account, much of the information we think is private on social networks is actually readily available for people who are willing to spend the time to find it,” Tucker said.
Specious….

USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences is considering four candidates for the position of dean of Dornsife.
Of the more than 170 applicants, an advisory committee, headed by Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett and Dean of Dornsife Howard Gillman, selected Steve Kay, dean of the division of biological sciences at UC San Diego; Peter Bearman, professor of social sciences at Columbia University; Harry Atwater, a professor of applied physics and material science at the California Institute of Technology; and Lauren Benton, New York University dean of the humanities, as the final candidates.
Each candidate will come to campus for two days in March and will meet with students, faculty, staff and senior administrators.
Kay, who is the first candidate to visit USC, began teaching at UC San Diego in 2007 and specializes in cell and developmental biology and the use of genomic tools to understand the circadian network, the 24-hour cycle within the human body.
Kay attended an open forum for students and faculty on Wednesday and said, if selected as the new dean of Dornsife, he wants to transform Dornsife into a leading global institution.
“The key point of my vision for Dornsife is to make Dornsife the premier institution on the Pacific Rim for scholarship, the translation of ideas for the benefit of society and for training critical thinkers and leaders,” Kay said.
Bearman is the founder and director of Columbia’s Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy. His research focuses on network analysis, including adolescent sexual networks and networks of disease prevention.
Atwater is the director of CalTech’s Kavli Nanoscience Institute and studies electronics and photonics, or light.
Benton’s research focuses on the legal history of European Empires and is the recipient of the World History Association Book Award in 2003.
Gillman, who has served as dean of Dornsife since 2007, declined to serve another term as dean in September.
Under Gillman’s leadership, Dornsife received a $200-million naming donation from USC Trustees Dana and David Dornsife, external funding for research reached $76 million annually and the graduation rate increased from 85 percent to 90 percent.
The dean of Dornsife is responsible for overseeing 33 academic departments and 31 research institutions and centers. The dean is also in charge of faculty recruitment, fundraising and the expansion of research opportunities for students and faculty.
In a memorandum to members of Dornsife, Garrett said she encourages all students and faculty members to actively participate in the recruitment process.

The USC men’s basketball team will begin its final homestand of the season Thursday night, taking on the Washington Huskies (20-8, 13-3) at the Galen Center. The two teams find themselves in polar opposite situations — the Huskies sit atop the Pac-12, winners of four games in a row and 12 of their last 14, while the Trojans (6-23, 1-15) have dropped seven straight with only one victory dating back to Nov. 22.
Few chances left · Junior guard Greg Allen and the Trojans are still searching for their second conference victory. Washington, meanwhile, looks poised to make the NCAA tournament and will be a tough matchup. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The last time USC and Washington faced off on Feb. 4, the Trojans suffered their worst loss of the season, 69-41.
“Those guys are obviously playing great basketball,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said of the Huskies. “They’re an experienced group except for [Tony] Wroten. They’ve all been together. We did a good job up there [on Feb. 4] for about 30 minutes and then it kind of caved in on us.”
The Huskies rank fifth in the country in rebounds — 40.1 per game — and are also 35th in scoring at 74.9 points per contest. They utilize a three-guard backcourt featuring the aforementioned Wroten (16.7 points per game), Terence Ross (15.1 points and 6.7 rebounds per game) and C.J. Wilcox (13.8 points per game).
“We know they’re real talented offensively,” freshman forward Byron Wesley said. “They’ve got some really good scorers — Tony Wroten and Ross — so we’ve just got to go out there, focus on our game plan, play some good defense and I think we should be OK.”
Wesley has been on a tear as of late for USC, averaging close to 19 points per game dating back to a Feb. 15 64-54 loss against UCLA.
“I’ve been feeling more comfortable on the court, just being out there and getting all these minutes,” Wesley said. “My confidence is just getting better.”
Coach O’Neill has been pleased with Wesley’s progress in recent weeks and will be counting on the freshman forward to once again produce big numbers to keep up with Washington’s offensive onslaught.
“Byron has developed into a guy that we hope is going to be a premier player,” O’Neill said. “If anything good has come out of this year, he’s become a guy who is experienced, hard-nosed, tough.”
Following Thursday night’s game, which tips off at 7:30 p.m. and will stream live at USCTrojans.com, USC will finish off the regular season against Washington State (14-14, 6-10) on Saturday. O’Neill’s message to his team as they prepare for the Cougars and the Pac-12 tournament on March 7 remains the same as always.
“Do your job to the best of your abilities,” O’Neill said. “We know our circumstances, they’ve been in place for a long time. What we’ve got to do is do the best we can to try and win games.”

The No. 5 men’s swimming team, finishing less than a second behind the winners of the 200-yard medley and 800-yard free, had a strong showing on the first day of the Pac-12 championships in the East Los Angeles Swim Center in Monterey Park, Calif. on Wednesday.
Tough conference · The USC swim and dive team is ranked No. 5 in the country, but they sit at third place in the Pac-12 conference. - Gary Chien | Daily Trojan
USC currently sits in third place with 64 points. Stanford, who has won the Pac-12 conference championship every year since 1982, is currently in first with 74 points, with California right behind them with 72 points. Arizona sits in fourth with 60 points, followed by Utah and UC Santa Barbara (54), Arizona State (50) and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo(44).
USC started the night with a fourth-place finish in a close 200-yard medley, led by juniors Nick Karpov and Matt Voell, sophomore Vladimir Morozov and freshman Sergio Lujan Rivera, with a time of 1:26.08, less than one second behind first-place California (1:25.09), and .25 behind the school record of 1:25.83. Stanford (1:25.46) and Arizona (1:25.60) finished the race in second and third, respectively. Morozov provided a final push for the Trojans, finishing his 50-yard in 18.43, the fastest individual time in the event by 0.40 seconds.
USC followed up its opening efforts with a second-place finish in the 800-yard freestyle, narrowly missing its second 800-yard free title in three years. The quartet of sophomores Dimitri Colupaev and Jack Wagner and freshmen Chad Bobrosky and Cristian Quintero finished with a time of 6:19.71, an NCAA “A” cut and season-best, but fell short of Stanford’s first place time of 6:18.99.
Colupaev’s opening leg of 1:33.97 started the Trojans off in second, and Bobroksy’s run of 1:34.92 left them 0.90 behind first place. USC was in third entering Quintero’s anchor leg, where he swam a 1:34.91, the fastest final swim that pushed USC ahead of California but wasn’t enough to overcome Stanford.
The Pac-12 Championships continue Thursday at 11 a.m. with the preliminaries for the 500-yard free, the 200-yard individual medley, the 50-yardfree and 1-meter diving.

The USC men’s and women’s tennis teams are both nationally ranked in the top-five in the latest polls released.
Cherish it, Trojans.
It is rare for a school to have a sport where both men’s and women’s teams are among the best in the country in a particular year.
Chasing history · Few programs can boast championships in the same men’s and women’s sport in the same season. USC is on the verge of joining the group with help from players such as senior Allison Ramos. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The first reason for this? Well, there isn’t as much crossover in the sports as one might think; there is, for example, no opposite-sex equivalent for football or softball — baseball is far different.
But second, and perhaps most importantly, is that schools generally do not invest equal resources into their men’s and women’s programs. Generally, the best coaches aren’t available for hire because they are out of the athletic department’s price range.
This season, however, Peter Smith is leading a Trojan squad that is looking for its fourth-consecutive national championship. They sit atop the polls and figure to until they lose.
Richard Gallien, on the other hand, has led the Women of Troy to the No. 2 spot nationally, and has USC poised to win its first championship since 1985.
To put into perspective how rare it is to have a sport win both men’s and women’s titles in the same year, let’s look at some of the squads that have accomplished the feat.
2004 Connecticut basketball
The 2004 men’s team was led by guard Ben Gordon and forward/center Emeka Okafor. This team was dominant. They went 33-6 and Gordon and Okafor were the third and second picks in the 2004 draft, respectively. The women were led by forward Diana Taurasi and legendary coach Geno Auriema. They went 31-4 and defeated Tennessee in the national championship game by nine points.
1984 UCLA volleyball
Volleyball can sometimes go unnoticed, but the Bruins were tough to ignore in 1984. The men’s squad went undefeated, while the women went 33-6. The competition wasn’t even close.
2011 California swim and dive
Cal has been a dominant force in swim and dive the past few years. Coach Teri McKeever led the women to the top spot last season, while coach David Durden took the men to the top of the swimming world.
2010 USC water polo
Jovan Vavic is the coach of USC’s men’s and women’s teams, and the success the men have been known for has certainly been evident on the women’s side, too. The Trojans have won four titles in a row, and the women have been in the national championship game four of the last six seasons. The women are poised to win a title this year; we will have to wait and see how it ends up unfolding.
2003 Stanford cross-country
Cross-country falls under the radar as much as any sport does, as most fans do not line up to watch. Stanford, however, managed to establish dominance in 2003 despite a lack of public attention on them. Pretty impressive, considering the students at the schools likely didn’t know they had             cross-country teams.
There are probably others that I have missed, but the point is that if there are, there aren’t many.
It is uncommon for a men’s and women’s program from the same school to win a championship because, plain and simple, schools don’t always focus on the sexes equally. Tennessee basketball has dominated the women’s circuit, but the men’s team has yet to win a title.
North Carolina women’s soccer has won multiple titles, yet the men have just one.
Duke men’s basketball has dominated. The women? No titles. The fact is that it just doesn’t happen.
USC fans should be proud of where the men’s and women’s tennis teams stand this season. If both teams do end up at the top of the college rankings, we need to be proud. Proud that our teams have reached rarified air.
Though football is king here, it should not overshadow the accomplishment that USC might be close to earning. It has only happened a handful of times, and the fact that it could happen at USC is noteworthy.

Only a storied rivalry can amplify the existing intensity of a battle between two top-five tennis powers.
In a crosstown clash against No. 3 UCLA (11-2), the No. 1 Trojans (14-0) extended their win streak to 34 matches with a 6-1 nonconference victory over the rival Bruins at the Los Angeles Tennis Center on Wednesday.
Rivalry match · Freshman Jordi Vives and the Trojans ended the Bruins’ three-match winning streak on Wednesday. The Trojans are chasing their fourth-consecutive national championship. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
Despite battling a sore shoulder, No. 5 senior Steve Johnson clinched the victory for the Trojans with a 6-4, 6-2 win over No. 33 Nick Meister for USC’s 4-0 advantage and his 48th consecutive singles win.
“I just try to have fun out there and not think about any streak,” Johnson said. “To beat them on their home court is pretty special. We have a great group of guys on this team. I’m happy to see the progress that we’re making.”
On court five, USC freshman Yannick Hanfmann, ranked No. 38, claimed the first singles match over Dennis Mkrtchian 6-4, 6-1. No. 22 sophomore Ray Sarmiento then ousted UCLA’s No. 81 Clay Thompson 6-4, 6-3 before Johnson’s clincher.
After USC had wrapped up the victory, No. 15 senior Daniel Nguyen and freshman Roberto Quiroz took their matches, while No. 32 sophomore Emilio Gomez took his first singles loss in 11 matches for UCLA’s only point for the day.
“It felt really good to get the win here, especially in Westwood,” Sarmiento said. “I felt like the energy on our side was great.”
The Trojans began the match with a sweep in doubles action for a 1-0 advantage. Hanfmann and freshman Eric Johnson first paired up for a 9-7 win over Thompson and Warren Hardie.
Nguyen and Sarmiento, ranked No. 49 in the nation in doubles, followed with an 8-5 victory over the No. 52 pair Meister and sophomore Adrien Puget that notched the doubles point for USC.
On court two, Gomez and Quiroz capped off the final doubles match over Alex Brigham and Marcos Giron, 9-8.
USC’s victory snapped UCLA’s three-game winning streak and gave the Bruins their second loss of the season.
The Bruins currently lead the series 99-85, and the two squads will meet again on April 20 at Marks Stadium for each side’s regular season finale.
The new International Tennis Association rankings released Tuesday had bumped the Bruins up five spots to their No. 3 position, while the Trojans retained their top spot in the nation for the sixth consecutive week.
“[The rankings] are just numbers. It doesn’t really matter,” Sarmiento said. “Once we’re on the court, that’s when it matters. We just have to stick to our game plan and keep fighting.”
USC’s next dual match will be against Virginia Tech (4-3) on March 9 at 3 p.m. at Marks Stadium.
Before that, five pairs of Trojans will travel to La Jolla, Calif., to participate in the Pacific Coast Doubles Championship from March 1-4.
USC alumni Peter Lucassen and Jaak Poldma and USC coach Peter Smith and his son Tanner will also participate in the annual seven-round doubles competition.
Jordi Vives is a fantastic player and better person!!
Barcelona love him!!!!

College students face many struggles. Deadlines, essays and exams can really weigh a person down.
But I can’t understand students who complain about not having money.
Finding an impoverished student in any USC classroom is difficult. Maybe it’s the flood of illuminated Apple symbols emanating from the $1200 laptops, or maybe the rows of $200 longboards.
It’s also difficult finding the struggling student when walking through the campus center plaza. Boxes from Seeds Marketplace and California Pizza Kitchen lie on every table. Has anyone contracted scurvy yet from subsisting entirely on ramen noodles?
Maybe the true issue is the frugality of the student.
According to DegreeCentral.com, students in the United States spend approximately $10.5 billion a school year.
Of this $10.5 billion, 40 percent goes to extra funds — electronics, traveling and social life — while only 4 percent goes to books and supplies. Make no mistake about it: The occasional bout of binge drinking burns through funds.
The starving student is nothing more than a luxury-seeking scholar, spending too much money on fad headphones and smartphones while complaining about being broke.
Realistically speaking, it is near impossible to not spend money in a college environment. The quick bite to eat relieves you from cooking and it saves time. For many students, the weekend isn’t complete without a drink. If there’s free cable, the apartment will obviously need a television.
Budgeting and wise spending leads to savings, eliminating the common complaint of not having any money. Before taking these steps, however, students should refrain from calling themselves broke.
We should at least wait until we’re debt-ridden alumni.

I hate to be so nit-picky, but I think you’re playing into the University of Spoiled Children stereotype. Not all of the students are here can afford to be here. Personally, I have no one helping me out–I had to get scholarships, grants and get loans co-signed by a family friend because my own family refused to do so. I then had to get a job just to pay for the gas to get here and for that food you so derisively mention (perhaps the issue is the fact that food on campus is waaaay to expensive and buying it does make us students broke). I’m sorry, when I complain about being broke I literally mean that I have no money in my bank account, wallet or in my piggy bank at home. Sometimes I’m too broke to afford the gas to make it to school and have to sit at home, trying to study on my own. And most of the time, when I can make it to campus I walk around  hungry because I have NO money. I know that I’m not the only one. Don’t assume so much. You aren’t fixing anything by criticizing people, maybe the next time someone complains about being broke you should ask what they mean and not assume everyone to be so sheltered.

USC students who party at 2 a.m. on Saturday morning are likely to wake up middle-aged men and women who have just completed a week at work. If the noise comes as a surprise, one can expect older citizens in the area to try to stop the festivities as quickly as possible — not to calmly voice their concerns to the party perpetrators.
After long weeks filled with midterms, classes and extracurricular activities, it is only natural that young and energetic students would want to relax at an off-campus party on a Friday night.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Since much of the housing between 36th Street and Vermont and Budlong avenues has been converted into living areas for USC students, and an increased number of students are living in non-university-owned housing, a surge in off-campus partying is also understandable.
When so many students live close to each other, however, they tend to forget about non-student residents of the community who are likely to be disturbed by loud house parties that continue until 1 or 2 a.m. in the morning.
Usually, when a house party disrupts community residents, they call USC’s Dept. of Public Safety, and DPS officers typically arrive promptly to shut down the party. Unfortunately, this situation isn’t ideal for anyone. The predicament could easily be resolved by a pre-arranged compromise between student hosts and their non-USC neighbors.
At the start of each semester, students who anticipate throwing parties throughout the year should notify neighboring community residents about their tentative plans. Together, prospective hosts and older citizens should agree on an acceptable noise level for parties, and the hosts should promise to clean up trash from the party on the day after the event to help keep community streets clean. This compromise would please both the community residents who want to catch up on their sleep and the USC students who are craving a night out uninterrupted by DPS officers.
Such a compromise would also help students improve USC’s reputation and discourage the unfair and outdated portrayal of USC as the “University of Spoiled Children,” an image that President C. L. Max Nikias has been trying to shed in his quest to elevate the university’s standing.
Though community residents might wish to eliminate the noise from USC parties altogether, we could soften their hearts — and the sensitivity of their ear buds — by showing them courtesy and attempting to compromise before throwing the parties.
Moreover, neighbors should be aware that many of these irksome parties are hosted by charitable organizations like Youths Exploring Passion, a group dedicated to mentoring pregnant teenagers at local high schools; Women and Youth Supporting Each Other, a group that discourages adolescents from engaging in sexual violence; and USC Active, which mentors young teenagers in high-risk nearby schools. By calling DPS to shut down these parties, neighbors are stemming funds that could make a difference in the areas around USC.
If a neighbor refuses to negotiate with potential party hosts regarding noise level prior to the party itself, he or she is being unreasonable about the reality of living next to college students. DPS should take such unwillingness to compromise into consideration before completely shutting down a party because of one noise complaint.
In general, however, USC students should learn to be considerate of their neighbors without being forced to end their nighttime activities early. Compromising with neighbors first will help students maintain amicable relationships with members of the surrounding community while continuing to enjoy house parties.

The University’s hypocritical prohibition of alcohol on the row, which occurred decades ago, is resposible for pushing the parties into the surrounding community. USC should bring back responsible drinking on the row, not a total prohibition.
This a direct result of the sanctions placed upon The Row.
If the University wasn’t so adament about silencing The Row, there would be significantly fewer parties being forced into the surrounding community – which, by the way, have less accountability and risk management capabilities than any 28th St fraternity house.

To understand the present, look to the past.
The ancient Greeks saw war in all of its dehumanizing ferocity. In 416 BCE, Euripides wrote Herakles to parallel civil wars in Greece, contrasting the madness of war with the madness of Hercules (Herakles), the demigod son of Zeus.
The New York-based Aquila Theatre production of Herakles, a Visions and Voices: The USC Arts & Humanities Initiative event on Tuesday at Bovard Auditorium, demonstrates the connection to war in the bluntest light through talented actors and the stories of real-life veterans.
The mask · Though authentic, the tragic masks used in the modern adaptation of Herakles detract from the performances and play overall. - Photo courtesy of Visions and Voices
Thebes has erupted: Lycus (Brian Delate, also playing Herakles) has overthrown Creon, the father of Megara (Michele Vazquez) and father-in-law of Herakles. To prevent Herakles’ children from taking future vengeance, Lycus has sentenced them to death, along with their mother and paternal grandfather Amphitryon (Richard Sheridan Willis). The demigod himself has disappeared into Hades to nab Cerberus, the last of his 12 labors. When Herakles finally rides in to save the day, the always bitter goddess and stepmother Hera sets a wave of insanity upon him, which ends with the murder of his family.
The Aquila Theatre adaptation strips Herakles down to its bare bones. The chorus has vanished, the set is sparse and the actors’ faces are frozen in classical theater masks. In between scenes, there are video clips of real-life military veterans who reflect on their time during and after their service.
This production is part of Aquila’s Ancient Greeks/Modern Lives project, a veteran-centered program that stages readings of Greek plays across the United States.
Though Euripides wrote Herakles with the Peloponnesian War in mind, this version bluntly alludes to post-traumatic stress disorder. The connection deepens when soldiers discuss their own alienation upon returning home. As their stories develop, we see their scars and haunted dreams, from an older soldier who saw a bomb go off in a group of children to a young man who poorly hides his trauma behind a liberal use of f-bombs.
Perhaps unintentionally, the use of video also covers up a criticism of the original Euripides play. The show begins with Herakles triumphing over Lycus and saving his family, then going bonkers and slaughtering them — the two halves bear little connection. The video, complete with more war stories and reflections, adds space between the scenes and softens the sudden shift.
The actors also bring the story to life. Vazquez and Delate bring a humanity to Megara and Herakles. Willis shines brightest of the cast — his keening Amphitryon and compassionate Theseus feel completely different, but both dominate their scenes.
Peter Meineck, an accomplished scholar, professor and artistic director of the Aquila Theatre, has translated and adapted Herakles with supreme clarity. Older translations use more poetic tones and mythological references, but the lucidity of Meineck’s translation ensures the audience comprehends every line.
As a poet, Euripides cast his characters in human roles, taking their mythic trappings and winding them around mortal issues such as war and patriotism. Modern warfare easily coalesces with Euripides’ 2,500-year-old work.
The connection with the divine also lends itself well to contemporary interpretations. Many Greek works focused on ruinous flaws, fate, prophecy and order-seeking gods. Here, Herakles does not fall to personal shortcomings and Hera acts out of chaotic spite.
Ultimately, Herakles must accept the destruction of his world, live on and attempt to reestablish meaning. It is a fitting message for modern people scarred by life’s unforeseeable cruelties.
Despite the raw emotion of the performance and video, it could have been handled with more subtlety. Some of the lines, though clear, read with all the nuance of a sledgehammer. A touch more of the Greek lyricism could have provided more contrast.
Meineck has written extensively on the use of masks in traditional Greek theatre. They stand out in Herakles and force the actors to use more intensity in their voices and body language. The masks, however, come with a price — speech sounds muffled and the fixed, open-mouthed expressions border on creepy.
Conversely, the goddess Iris and hero Theseus, maskless, convey a subtler power with expressions, along with movements and inflections. Though it otherwise kept the masks, the creative team did not stick exclusively to authentic Greek staging — the thong-wearing woman who stands as a personification of madness breaks into interpretive dance ushered in by rock music. It’s an interesting scene, but one Euripides probably did not have in mind.
Despite certain downfalls, Herakles combines the truth of the ancient Greeks with the emotions of modern day. Aristotle argued that tragic theatre can provide a form of catharsis. If Meineck and Aquila Theatre can connect with veterans and show they are not alone after the battlefield, they are doing much more than just providing entertainment.

What’s the best way to tell a story? Last week, an article in the AV Club by Ryan McGee questioned if the rise in serialized television dramas had killed off the singular episode as a way of telling the story. McGee said that as longer storylines emerged, the basic episode stopped being its own story, but rather became just a segment of the overarching plot, which took away its viewing pleasure on an individual basis.
Comic books face a similar dilemma. Many years ago, a single issue of a comic could pack in multiple, one-and-done stories to a single issue. That changed to one issue equaling one story. But as time caught on, multi-issue story arcs became more popular.
At the turn of the century, this practice began to pick up. Companies started collecting story arcs into compilations called trade paperbacks, with usually six issues from a series in one package.
Brian Michael Bendis, who quickly became Marvel’s top star, handling almost all of its event titles and major ongoings such as The Avengers, wrote stories that excelled for this trade format. His dialogue-heavy, spaced out and decompressed plots lent themselves to a longer narrative. When his writing began to take off, other writers with similar styles rose to prominence.
Long-form story arcs offer some advantages. For readers who want a story meatier than the 22 pages of plot in a typical comic but don’t want to commit to following a series for years, collected story arcs strike a balance. Similarly, readers might not be fans of a particular title, but might like the creative team that jumps on it for a short run.
But this has also led to some unfortunate results in comics. With trade paperbacks growing more popular and lengthy story arcs earning critical acclaim, many writers and companies are pushing for more series to fit that mold. “Writing for the trade,” as it were, has become a common tactic.
Not every story was worth six issues, however, and not every writer is into decompressed tales, leaving many stories floundering, whether read as monthlies or as trades. Stories end up getting padded with filler content, be it longer action scenes, tangential dialogue or tacked on subplots.
Not only that, but it could actually be hurting the market. As more stories get padded and stretched out for trades, readers might not see the implicit value in going out every month and getting each individual series. “Trade waiting” has been on the rise in the last decade, with readers turning to trade-heavy bookstores instead of local comic bookstores.
According to ComicsBeat.com, sales of monthlies have dropped — and that seems to be endangering retailers. And while bookstores brought comics to a wider audience, the collapse of chain stores like Borders is putting the distribution line at risk.
But it seems like the pendulum is now swinging away from trade-focused writing. Creators are focusing on giving single issues a stronger center, while not abandoning character arcs or narratives. For instance, Mark Waid’s relaunched Daredevil title packs in new adventures and adversaries each month, while slowly developing the titular superhero’s psychological issues. The end result is fun issues that leave the reader craving more -— not because the story is unfinished, but because the reader wants more of that specific narrative.
At the same time, writers trying to tell one major, overarching story are working to ensure that each individual issue offers something relevant to the plot, rather than just as a filler until the climax of one narrative arc. Take Brian Wood and Riccardo Burchielli’s DMZ, for instance. It struck the balance between major, arc-specific plots and an ongoing look at war and how it affected those caught in it.
It’s not that writing for the trade or trade waiting are inherently bad. Some stories just work best over a longer format. In television, shows like Mad Men or Breaking Bad can be enjoyed in one season-long marathon via DVD, not unlike trade paperbacks in comics. But then there are shows like The Prisoner or Fringe, where each episode offers its own unique story while still playing a role in an overall narrative.
It depends on the series and how the creative teams want to approach it. For a long time, it seemed like arcs would replace one-and-dones, but now the industry seems to be shifting to a balanced median.
The single issue isn’t dead, despite growing concern over the last decade. Though the fad of writing for the trade definitely gripped writers, it never cemented its hold. If anything, it offered an experimental counter to the isolated one-and-done issues of the past. Neither extreme is preferable. Now creative teams are pushing out comics that are satisfying on a monthly basis and also propel a longer storyline. Because of this balance, readers are benefiting.

That Is All: An Evening With John Hodgman
Largo at the Coronet
Friday, March 2, 8:30 p.m.
Daily Show “Resident Expert” John Hodgman — you probably also remember him as the sad, uncool “PC” in Apple’s “Get A Mac” ad campaign — brings his mix of nerdy humor and sharp wit to Largo at the Coronet.
The show is in support of his 2011 satirical almanac, That Is All, and features ruminations on subjects such as how to enjoy fine wine, how to commit the perfect crime and how to deal with Ragnarök — a super-apocalypse based on Nordic mythology that states that we will all die as the world becomes submerged underwater.
All in all, the almanac serves as useful information.
The show looks to draw a full house, and tickets are $25.

Gray Whale Migration — Whale Watching Cruise
Newport Landing Whale Watching on Balboa Peninsula

That’s where Newport Landing Whale Watching steps in.
The whale watching company offers informed tours, detailing the mass migration — one of the longest marine mammal migrations at that — of the California gray whale down the coast of North America to Baja, Mexico, every year.
Tickets run for $31 and the migration typically goes through April, but get in while you can as boats will be filling quickly.
Grab your sea legs — and Dramamine — and take a break from city life to get a real glimpse of nature.

Music was something that Jamie Whitton, the petite, doe-eyed singer-songwriter, knew from a young age would become more than just a hobby.
“As the youngest of six children, I always heard the sound of my siblings and their musical endeavors. My family was really like [the Von Trapp family in] The Sound of Music,” she said.
Moving up · Between failed record deals and underdeveloped music, Whitton had a difficult rise to fame. But now the artist has made her mark with her vintage style in the music world and on television shows. - Photo courtesy of Whitton PR
By the age of six, Whitton was performing and honing her musical finesse as part of the Sunshine Generation, an all-girl song and dance company.
“We would dazzle everyone who saw us,” Whitton said with a chuckle.
Whitton participated in as many theater and dance-related activities as her school offered, and though she enjoyed every second of it, she began to realize that there was something missing.
She still wanted to perform, but instead of singing songs that others had written, Whitton wanted to sing songs that embodied her voice, her melodies and her lyrics — as well as her influences.
“I am a singer-songwriter,” Whitton said. “The ’40s, with its vintage sound from the Big Band era, has really influenced me. You can’t forget about the legends like Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra.”
Whitton has a sound that allowed her to stand out from other artists. Her success, however, was due in part to being at the right place at the right time.
Unfortunately, Nevada — not exactly the best place to launch a music career — did not quite fulfill that “right place” requirement. So it wasn’t until her family packed up and moved from Reno to Los Angeles that Whitton was truly able to pursue her dreams.
“California was definitely new and exciting to me. I didn’t know what to expect,” Whitton said.
But before she could start headlining concerts and attracting a dedicated fan base, Whitton had to get her name out there. She was, after all, only one singer in a city bustling with actors and musicians, all waiting for their moment in the limelight.
Though Whitton was approached with record offers as soon as she started performing around Los Angeles, something still didn’t feel right to her.
“At that point in my life, I was not ready. I kept thinking, ‘How come I can’t find the right deal,’” she said. “Yet everything happens for a reason: My music wasn’t ready. It wasn’t perfected. It wasn’t polished. Record deals fell through and I became very disappointed.”
Though Whitton made some initial mistakes, momentum began to pick up and her hopes grew as soon as she put together her five-song EP Whitton, which opened many doors of opportunity.
“As my journey [has] continued, I have been able to collaborate with people who are well-known in the industry, and have learned so much,” Whitton said.
Such people include Peter Fox — who has worked with Rachael Yamagata — and Joe Solo (Macy Gray), who co-wrote tracks on Whitton’s new album Rare Bird.
Her music has also been featured in shows such as Dexter and Gossip Girl and films like All I Want To Do starring Charlie Sheen and Hilary Duff.
And without missing a beat, Whitton has begun a successful tour. She is currently making her way around California, Oregon and Washington in support of the release of Rare Bird.
“I love the freedom of being on tour. I love going to new places, especially playing to an audience that has never seen me before or doesn’t know me. It’s a really cool and fun thing to meet new people,” Whitton said.
Depending on the size of the venue, Whitton either plays and sings with a 10-piece ensemble or a smaller trio consisting of herself on vocals and guitar, a multi-instrumentalist who does brass and woodwind instruments and a drummer.
With such lively presentation, Whitton finds that the shows on her tour attract more emotionally and musically focused crowds.
“Live audiences are attentive. It’s the best when people in these audiences are intimate and pensive — I love when they come talk to me after the show,” she said.
It’s understandably tiring to constantly tour and sing with barely enough time to catch a breath between shows, but Whitton finds ways to stay motivated despite her hectic schedule.
“After my last show, I began to think about why I love music,” she said. “I realized when you see people in the audience and see them singing your lyrics and coming up to you after the show, telling you how your songs have touched them … that’s the biggest high I could ever ask for.”
Whitton will appear on GVB Radio in Hollywood on March 5 and perform at the Villain’s Tavern in Downtown Los Angeles on March 7.

Woody Allen will be adapting his 1994 film, Bullets Over Broadway, into a musical that will open on Broadway in 2013.
Julian Schlossberg and Letty Aronson, his producing team, who were also behind the filmmaker’s 2011 Broadway show, Honeymoon Hotel, announced the project.
Bullets Over Broadway is generally considered to be one of Woody Allen’s finest films. The film stars John Cusack as an idealistic writer in the late 1920s, who enlists the help of a mobster in writing his play and is surprised to discover that he is a much more talented writer. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning Dianne Wiest her second Oscar.
Woody Allen will write the book for the musical himself, which is also said to feature period music. The creative team, cast and performance schedule have not yet been released.
The 76-year-old writer and director is showing no signs of slowing down. In addition to his commitments with the musical, he will be releasing his next film, Nero Fiddled, on June 22. The film features a cast that includes Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Alec Baldwin, Penélope Cruz and even Woody Allen himself, in his first acting role since his 2006 film, Scoop.
Woody Allen won his fourth Oscar on Sunday for the original screenplay for Midnight in Paris, which has also become his most successful film. The 76-year-old writer and director, however, skipped the Oscars in favor of the NBA All-Star Game.

In a sincere Tumblr blog post written by Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy, the performer announced that he has no interest in performing in public any time soon.
Stump was prompted to write this post after reading a nostalgic article from underthegunreview.net, where the author, Jacob Tender, talked about how important Fall Out Boy’s 2005 album, From Under the Cork Tree, was to him.
After Fall Out Boy became more mainstream in the industry after From Under the Cork Tree was released, the attitude toward the band changed.
People began to concentrate on Pete Wentz’s hair and wishing the band’s sound would revert back to being more like its second album, Take This to Your Grave, released in 2003.
According to Stump, Fall Out Boy’s last album Folie A Deux was the most openly hated by audiences and was the band’s poorest selling major label album.
Stump said touring stopped being fun when fans only wanted to hear old songs. He realized this when he was basically booed for playing new songs.
“We were rotten vegetable targets in Clandestine hoodies,” said Stump.
When Fall Out Boy went on hiatus in 2009, Stump decided to take better care of himself and work on other projects.
He released his solo album Soul Punk through Island Records and took the initiative to lose weight.
That didn’t stop people from being critical of his every move.
Stump said some people would say, “We liked you better fat.”
People even sent threatening hate mail to his home and some went to the shows on his solo tour to tell him he “sucked without Fall Out Boy.”
“The hate really crushed me,” he said.
It didn’t help when he tried to stand up for himself, because some people had no sympathy for an artist they believed to have millions of dollars.
For Stump, money means nothing to him besides living comfortably and avoiding bankruptcy.
“There’s no amount of money that makes you feel better when people think of you as a joke or hack or a failure or ugly or stupid or morally empty,” Stump said.
For now, Stump is deciding to disappear for a bit from the performance scene. The feeling of being a disappointment to people has become overbearing.
Lately, he has worked as a professional songwriter and producer available for hire. Stump is going to go with the flow and said performing again will happen when it happens.
In terms of working with Fall Out Boy, he said they still have not broken up, but doesn’t expect to do anything with them soon since the other members are currently working on new projects.
“I, as always, would be super psyched to do the band again though,” Stump said.
OMG!!!!!!! please don’t ever stop performing, I will always be there at your shows. I have so much admiration for you and your music. I can 100% relate to alot of your songs and I always love the new stuff, the same ol’ things do eventually get old. but no  matter what I am so your #1 always and forever!!! thank you for singing me happy birthday!! it meant the world to me!!!! I wish you the very best and please keep your head up your a good man and you deserve nothing but the best and happiness. I suffer from depression myself so I no how hard it can be to deal with that. Well I love ya and keep doing what you do best and thats singing!!!! and being sexy.
