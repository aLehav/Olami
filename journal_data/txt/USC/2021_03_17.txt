With a tightly-contested 5-2 win against the No. 35 San Diego Toreros, the No. 10 USC men’s tennis team is staying on pace to end the season strong after their stumbles over the last month. 
USC men’s tennis began the season as the No. 1 ranked team in the nation in both singles and doubles after a successful start. However, currently ranked No. 10, things have changed since then. 
The Trojans kept their stride at the start of February winning their games against Saint Mary’s, UC Irvine, San Diego State and Kentucky. During the sweep against Saint Mary’s, head coach Brett Masi picked up his 200th win, an outstanding milestone in his illustrious career so far.  
However, the team went through a rough patch at the 2021 ITA National Team Indoor Championship where they were looking to repeat as national champions. First, they faced an upset losing 1-4 to the host Illinois Fighting Illini, then lost to No. 5 Texas Longhorns 3-4 in the consolation semifinal match and finally falling 3-4 to No. 3 TCU Horned Frogs. 
Despite the Trojans’ sub-par performance at the ITA Indoor Championship, they kept their perseverance to bounce back during the end of the month by winning all three of their matchups, beating No. 5 TCU 4-0 at home. 
“Our guys were … chomping at the bit to be ready to play TCU when they came back,” head coach Brett Masi said about the team’s drive to bounce back from those losses. “[I am] just super proud of their ambition to want to come back [and] have revenge [against TCU].”
Another impressive match was against crosstown rivals, No. 17 UCLA, where the Trojans won decisively 4-3. 
The No. 1 Trojans double team of senior Daniel Cuckierman and redshirt senior Riley Smith were able to edge out senior Keegan Smith and junior Patrick Zahraj in a close 6-4 game. 
In singles, both No. 1 Cuckierman and No. 19 Smith lost their respective matches. However the other Trojans, No. 26 junior Mor Bulis, junior Bradley Frye, freshman Lodewijk Weststrate and junior Jake Sands were able to close up shop to hand the Trojans their win against the Bruins. 
Although the No. 8 men’s team was able to end the month of February on a high note, they faced another upset at home against local Malibu-based No. 27 Pepperdine Waves in a 3-4 loss. 
Despite not playing Cuckierman, the Trojans still fielded out their other top players like Smith and Bulis, but ended up losing in the doubles point. Pepperdine’s single wins against Bulis, junior Jake Sands and freshman Sean Holt, got them the 3-4 win against USC. 
In their first home Pac-12 conference match this season, the Trojans demonstrated their resilience and beat Utah Utes 7-0 despite not playing some of their starters. 
“We’re just getting ready to start playing, I think better and better each week,” said Masi on the team’s momentum. “More importantly what I have been happy with is the guys that have been able to step up in certain moments and jump in to win some big matches.
Moving forward the Trojans will continue conference play against the Stanford Cardinals, No. 16 Arizona Wildcats and No. 17 Arizona State Sun Devils. After conference regular-season games are over at the end of April, the Trojans will look forward to competing at the Pac-12 Championships. 
Even with a few hiccups over the last month, the Trojans men’s tennis team are determined to finish the season strong like last year.

Undergraduate Student Government Senators confirmed Benjamin Morain as the Chief Justice of the Judicial Council during Tuesday’s meeting. Senators also passed four resolutions ranging from providing food accessibility to supporting Burmese students
Morain, a junior majoring in political science, was initially nominated by President Gabe Savage to fill the role on the Judicial Council. While the meeting held an opportunity to debate Morain’s appointment, Senators raised no objections and confirmed Morain unanimously with nine votes. 
“I’m exhilarated and I’m very excited at the prospect of being able to shape the Judicial Council in a way that’s going to continue to maintain the accountability of elected officials and to strive to increase accessibility for the general student body,” Morain said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I’m really excited to be in a position where I can make that vision a reality.”
As Chief Justice, Morain will preside over trials and hearings between students and the student government. He also intends to improve his new role by creating an online submission system where students can make complaints and establish an email for the Chief Justice division for students to directly contact the Chief Justice. Morain said he hopes to improve internal communication between USG executives and administration. 
Following Morain’s confirmation, the meeting shifted to passing resolutions — the first being the “Continuing Resolution in Support of CalFresh at USC Campus Eateries.” Authored by members of both USG and the Graduate Student Organization, this resolution would implement a CalFresh program to help provide greater access to nutritional food on campus and ensure food vendors and markets become CalFresh authorized vendors.   
After the resolution passed with 11 unanimous votes, the student government moved to debate “A Resolution in Support of USC Palestinian Students,” which would urge the University to fly the Palestine flag on the exterior of The Center for International and Public Affairs. Authored by the Students for Justice in Palestine and Vice President Trinity Moore, various student assemblies, including the Black Student Assembly and Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, also supported the resolution. The resolution, which supports the inclusion and representation of students on campus, received 11 unanimous votes in support. 
Vice President Moore presented the third resolution, authored by former USG VP Mahin Tahsin: the “Continuing Resolution in Support of First-Year Course on Student Well-Being,” an initiative to implement THRIVE, a course that would encourage students to be aware of the resources available on campus that would promote good mental health, good physical health and good self-development.  According to the resolution, the course would also equip students with University values and developmental skills as they attend school. The resolution also passed unanimously with no debate.
The last resolution passed, “A Resolution in Support of Myanmar Students,” created in support of Burmese students affected by the coup d’état, was amended to include the support of the Political Student Assembly. Co-author Romeo also specified the situation in Myanmar as one affected by a military junta — a government run by military leaders. 
“We cannot recognize the current military that stole power, or the military junta, as a ‘military government’ because they are not,” Romeo said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “They have said there’s election fraud, they have claimed things that are not true and they have been killing their citizens.”
The Myanmar resolution successfully passed with eleven unanimous votes. With the resolution now in place, Romeo and other members of the Burmese Student Association intend to communicate with USC administrators to allow support and accommodations for Burmese students affected by the situation, including an extension of the Pass/No Pass deadline and financial assistance for those Burmese students outside and inside Myanmar.
The meeting came to an end with the appointment of Arie Abija, a junior majoring in theater and music production, to parliamentarian. Eleven unanimous votes confirmed her to the position.

After transferring to USC from Santa Monica College last semester, Gabriela Mucha and Jadrian Tan noticed that, while USC offered many competitive business clubs, there was no club for students who aspired to work for the business side of the technology industry. 
To remedy this problem, Mucha, a junior majoring in business administration, and Tan, a sophomore majoring in business administration and computer science, created Techie, a networking organization for students who wanted to know of the opportunities of going into the technology industry without having to code. The organization, which launched this spring, has around 30 members from a variety of majors and hosts professional development workshops, guest speakers and social events. 
“The idea first started at the beginning of the fall semester, when I was going through the recruitment process, and I’ve had some interviews with big tech companies,” Mucha said. “I’ve noticed that there’s no club at USC that has resources for people who want to go into tech.” 
Techie’s goal is to create a supportive community of like-minded people, regardless of differences in year or major, Mucha said. While joining the club did require an application, Mucha said everyone who applied was accepted. 
The application was a way to show members’ dedication and effort to join the club and to ensure that people would be excited to come to meetings, Isabel Gonzalez, Techie’s director of marketing said.
Gonzalez, a junior majoring in communication, initially learned about the club through a Facebook group for USC transfer students. Since Gonzalez grew up in Silicon Valley, she was surrounded by the tech community and has decided she wants to go into that field. She thought Techie was an opportunity for her to professionally grow, so she reached out to Mucha personally, and from there, the e-board was formed. 
“Since it was going to be targeted at the intersection of business and technology, and that’s the career that I’m pursuing, the club was perfect,” Gonzalez said. “I wanted to help along with the process of starting the club up.” 
As a new organization this semester, Mucha said that there are benefits and challenges to starting a club during the coronavirus pandemic.
“It’s definitely challenging to start a club during [the coronavirus] when we had no way of reaching out to people other than basically social media,” Mucha said. “Our entire marketing campaign was Instagram and hoping that people will see. But it also gives a good opportunity … it just wouldn’t be possible to have that many guest speaker events if it wasn’t for [the coronavirus]. Being on Zoom definitely helps with things like this.”
Kathleen Kwon, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said she heard about Techie through a Reddit post. 
“Since this is my first semester at USC, it has been very intimidating to find the right environment for me,” Kwon said. “Seeing how the e-board members of Techie were talking about [how] they want to be inclusive, they want to provide a safe space for the business students, for any USC students, it was very encouraging.” 
Techie is still attempting to grow, Gonzalez said, and is in the process of receiving more funds from USC, building their presence on social media platforms and creating a LinkedIn for their organization. The organization uses LinkedIn to find professionals to speak at Techie’s events, and are scheduled to have a recruiter from Twitter and an Xbox employee. 
The organization also shares opportunities and internships with one another, Gonzalez said. The e-board continuously lets one another know of internships, or programs going on outside of the organization. Currently, Mucha, Gonzalez, Tan and Aung Si, a junior majoring in business administration who is not in Techie, are participating in a USC Boeing Business Case Competition that Mucha found, where they create ideas and come up with a solution on how Boeing can become more sustainable. 
“I definitely don’t think we would have had that opportunity if we didn’t get all connected through Techie,” Gonzalez said. 
Despite the challenges Techie faced and their start in a virtual environment, Gonzalez said the organization is thankful for the support and interest they’ve received and are excited for their continual growth.
“We’re very grateful that certain people showed interest in the organization,” Gonzalez said. “I’m definitely looking forward to more opportunities like [the case competition] where Techie members can branch out and work in groups and in teams with people that they know from Techie outside [of the organization].”

Carlota Rodriguez-Benito has taken the beauty industry into her own hands.
Rodriguez-Benito, currently an innovation project manager at Chanel, decided to interrogate the beauty and cosmetics industry her senior year at USC by writing a book, “Beauty: As It Is.” It includes interviews with over 60 experts in the industry, among them Anastasia Soare, the CEO of makeup and cosmetics brand Anastasia Beverly Hills, and Bisila África Bokoko, the founder and CEO of New York-based business development agency BBES. Along with industry professionals, “Beauty: As It Is” also features interviews with regular trendsetters from various countries around the world. 
The book explores the ways in which beauty can be more inclusive and viewed more holistically. With each chapter featuring a different interviewee and story, the book is really a “beauty companion” that pushes readers to challenge their own perceptions of beauty, all through a multicultural lens. 
“Beauty: As It Is” is carefully stitched together from Rodriguez-Benito’s in-depth interviews on everything from inclusive beauty to skincare advice. The book tells the stories of people like Yalitza Aparicio — the “Roma” actress who made history by appearing on the cover of Vogue Mexico, as she is one of the only Indigenous people to be on the magazine’s cover — alongside that of Karla Martinez de Salas, the editor-in-chief of Vogue Mexico & Latin America.
“When I talked to Yalitza, it was such an emotional moment to talk to her and to see how she had felt about this,” Rodriguez-Benito said. “She told me that the day she saw herself on Vogue magazine she couldn’t believe her eyes. She hadn’t just made it as an individual. She had made it for a whole society.”  
As both an international student who has lived in six countries (and traveled to 35) and someone who majored in French, Russian and international relations, Rodriguez-Benito is interested in immersing herself into different cultures and creating a more comprehensive, global view of things, rather than simply relying on the singular one given to her. 
“I’m a culture fiend,” Rodriguez-Benito said. “I love learning about cultures, I love living in different places and seeing how different people act in different ways. I’m very curious about all that.”
However, despite this curiosity and desire to weave cultures together, Rodriguez-Benito said she thought she would eventually end up working in government after her time at USC when she graduated in 2019. But after a friend pushed her to rethink her goals and pursue work in a sector she’s actually passionate about, Rodriguez-Benito realized that what she really wanted to do was work in beauty.
She started to “frantically” apply to all kinds of jobs at beauty companies such as Estée Lauder and L’Oreal, but due to her lack of prior experience, wasn’t getting any offers. 
Then by a twist of fate, a Georgetown professor who had been reaching out to her through her LinkedIn page — which she had just brushed off as a scam — called her with the opportunity and platform to publish a book on whatever she wanted. She wanted to investigate what beauty meant in all areas of the world and how the concept and its implications changed from place to place. 
Rodriguez-Benito’s interest in beauty started at a young age. Though her mom was never invested in cosmetics and makeup, her two grandmothers were —one was very interested in  fashion and the other was into beauty. Together, they were able to shape their granddaughter’s love of beauty. Rodriguez-Benito recalls making face masks, watching beauty-related films and researching plastic surgery as a young girl. 
Along with her family, Rodriguez-Benito credits her open minded view of beauty to her international school experiences, in which she had friends from all kinds of backgrounds and was never really meant to put her definition of beauty into a box.
“No one ever looked alike,” Rodriguez-Benito said. “One of my best friends was from Norway, another was from Italy, Russia, Nigeria. I literally had no visual perception of what beauty standards were. I didn’t have a solid image of what a beauty standard was supposed to look like. 
Also, as a former ballerina, beauty and grace was something that was innate to her and to the craft. Through dance, she was taught to “radiate [her] inner beauty,” and even though Rodriguez-Benito left ballet after 14 years, she continued to carry its principles with her and eventually, into her book. 
“For me, beauty is the way you radiate and transmit your inner beauty,” Rodriguez-Benito said. “That’s really what my book entails — how to radiate this inner beauty.” 
Even though Rodriguez-Benito would move every two or three years, ballet was a constant throughout her life, no matter how transient everything else felt. She travelled the world dancing, and through her travels, she ended up questioning and confronting a lot of peoples’ perceptions of beauty.
“I realized that everywhere I lived, there was a different [perception of beauty],” Rodriguez-Benito said. “I lived in Russia. I lived in France. I lived in Spain. I lived in Mexico. I lived in the U.S. I lived in Switzerland. And [in] all these places I lived in, I realized and I was very aware that there was a different perception of beauty everywhere, a perception of physical beauty. However, everywhere I lived, every time I would dance [in these places] … I felt like people perceived ballet the same exact way.” 
Whenever she moved, she said she found herself questioning the difference between beauty in dance and physical beauty — why was there an agreement over whether a dance was beautiful or not, but not over what made a person physically attractive? 
Writing “Beauty: As It Is,” was not just a way to lay down roots in the industry she eventually wanted to work in, but also the way to finally get the answers to all her questions.
“[This book was] an opportunity to resolve this question, this big, big question [about beauty] that I’ve had since a very young age,” Rodriguez-Benito said.
When Rodriguez-Benito presented her sister, Jimena Rodriguez-Benito, a current finance and economics student at the University of Pennsylvania, with her book idea, Jimena was a bit thrown off at first but came around once she saw where Carlota’s talents could all merge together.
“I was confused by the idea, but when [Carlota] told me more and more about it, I was like ‘Wow, this is right up your alley.’” Jimena said. “She’s the best networker ever, she gets in touch with literally anyone and she’s always been very passionate about beauty and what it means to her and what it means to different cultures and people.” 
Haley Schusterman, one of Carlota’s close friends from USC who is a current grad student in the food studies program at NYU, also praised Carlota’s commitment and dedication throughout the year that she was working on “Beauty: As It Is.”
“I will always remember the day that [Carlota] told me she was considering writing a book, and from that moment on, she really poured her heart and soul and literally hundreds of hours of her time into producing it, while she was also finishing three majors at USC and working in France,” Schusterman said.
She went on to describe Carlota’s unwavering determination to accomplish her goal of creating a book that broke past society’s preconceived notions of what beauty is as well as one that was for a diverse audience.
“No matter how stressful or overwhelming things got throughout the process, [Carlota] never let self doubt get in the way and remained steadfast in her mission to share this knowledge about holistic beauty … but with the ultimate vision of empowering every person who picks up her book, which she has undoubtedly succeeded in,” Schusterman said. 
Similarly Carlota’s friend Lyle Li, a private client assistant at luxury fashion retail platform FarFetch who helped her throughout her editing process, spoke to how much he was able to learn from Carlota’s research process as well as the unique stories that she was able to present in her book. 
“I think for Carlota just her travels, her interviews, I gathered so much more about the beauty industry than I would have just through personal reading,” Li said. “[‘Beauty: As It Is’] was a great resource because it really gathered a lot of diverse perspectives from various individuals in the industry from corporate executives to people from indie brands, and I think the fact that this book also talks about men’s beauty, which I think is incredibly interesting.”
“Beauty: As It Is” is Carlota’s way of questioning the beauty industry in a way that no one ever has before — approaching the process from a place of authenticity and hope for the industry.
“[If the beauty industry was perfect], it [would be] inclusive to people from all backgrounds, all colors, all shapes and sizes,” Carlota said. “[The industry] is there to highlight all of our strengths and highlight our beauties and make us feel more beautiful.”
It’s clear that Carolta has put her own personal stamp on the beauty industry through writing her book. Every part of it is an encapsulation of her global worldview and exploration, from the way that it was inspired from a question she had as a kid to the ways that she finished the edits her last college semester in Paris while cafe hopping around the city. 
This past summer, Rodriguez-Benito began translating the book into Spanish, to make sure it’s accessible to even more people around the world. Now, she’s working on a book about the future of luxury, which will be out next year.
“We tend to think that beauty is something that is image related, where beauty is something that is so, so deeply found in each and every one of us, and we just need to learn how to emanate it to others,” Rodriguez-Benito said.

A couple of columns ago, I talked about my hesitation toward the month of March in the college basketball world. More specifically, I was worried about the dangers the conference tournaments pose right before the Indianapolis bubble NCAA men’s tournament. 
Unfortunately, it looks like some of my worries are starting to come true, most notably with my home state’s No. 3 Kansas Jayhawks getting knocked out of the Big 12 tournament after a positive coronavirus case and the same with no. 4 Virginia in the ACC who are both in the West region for this tournament. 
Although we knew even beforehand that the selection committee would choose these programs regardless of their coronavirus situation, it highlights the inadequate planning from the NCAA and its respective conferences on how they would manage this transition from the conference to the national tournament.
Back when the NBA had their bubble, they practically gave the NCAA the playbook on how to have a bubble tournament in a safe and effective manner. When the NBA bubble was created, teams arrived in Orlando July 7, and the resumption of the season/playoffs took place July 30. There was a gap for around three weeks for testing, making sure everyone is ready, etc. 
Although I do agree that the NBA’s gap was a bit too long for the purposes of the NCAA tournament since this is in a single-elimination format, there should be at least a week or two for the 68 teams to arrive in Indianapolis so everyone can be safe and on an equal playing field for the tournament. All individuals part of each team are assigned a single room and can only come and go to games and practices with official NCAA buses.  
In my last column about this subject, I did note that the NCAA does have a well-thought-out plan in place to try and keep everyone safe, where the teams’ squads need seven consecutive negative tests starting March 6 to go to the tournament. Those that are positive will end up having to quarantine and then can rejoin their team in the bubble. 
However, one important point that everyone is not putting enough emphasis on is coronavirus incubation times. As I have cited on many occasions throughout the course of my columns, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it takes up to 14 days for the virus to be at high enough levels in your body to cause a positive test. 
On top of that, making certain teams not have some of their vital players and staff participate because of a positive coronavirus test does not ensure fairness in tournament play. I mean that depending on who is out for a team, this can severely impact how well they can perform in Indianapolis. 
I know that is the standard that most leagues have put in place already during their seasons where teams just have to simply adjust if players and coaches are out because of the coronavirus. I think with the stakes of the NCAA tournament, where you either win or go home, there should be protocols in place so that every team will have all their assets available. 
Finally, teams have a deadline till March 16 for the men’s tournament to state whether they can attend, and if they are unable to replacement teams are available to take their place. However, once the tournament begins, any team that cannot participate anymore due to coronavirus will have their scheduled opponent advance. 
Overall, just starting tournament play this week is not the wisest decision and should at least be extended for another week. Because of the volatile circumstances of coronavirus, many other leagues have had to make similar decisions. 
But this upsets many fans, leading to widespread comments all over social media such as a Mickey Mouse Ring/Win/Championship (in reference to how the NBA bubble was at Disney World) to underline how these competitions are not authentic enough because of coronavirus’s impact on how well teams can play. 
Hopefully, no games have to be canceled/forfeited because of the coronavirus and we can have a safe, fair and fun tournament to look forward to.

March is Women’s History Month, thus, the Daily Trojan is celebrating achievements that have been made by trailblazers. With respect to the annual theme for 2021, “Valiant Women of the Vote: Refusing to Be Silenced,” we commemorate the honorable role of women who never backed down from a challenge and exceeded endeavors. 
Throughout history, USC is proud to notice alumnae and faculty who pursue excellence in the entertainment industry. Let’s meet some inspiring female figures who continue to break the grounds in entertainment.
Rayka Zehtabchi & Melissa Berton & Helen Yenser
Oscar winners, anyone? No one ever imagined that a film about menstruation would win the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject, but “Period. End of Sentence.” did in 2019. This documentary tells the tale of women in India who lack necessary sanitary protection, facing difficulties during their periods. While this topic of menstruation was taboo and easily disregarded as shameful or embarrassing, USC alumnae Rayka Zehtabchi, Melissa Berton and Helen Yenser, sought solutions to address this problem. The documentary follows through The Pad Project and Action India’s efforts to provide women in Kathikhera, New Delhi, with pad machines that create pads out of sustainable material. 
Yoo Lee
Yoo Lee, a graduate student studying animation and digital arts, was in her forties when she entered her screenwriting class, but her devoted eagerness for learning dubbed her worthy of success. Lee is the recipient of a $30,000 LAIKA Fellowship from Film Independent’s Project Involve program, providing her with a production grant to pursue her stop-motion passion. She strives to produce a stop-motion animated short film. Born in South Korea, Lee originally worked for the Saja fashion line in New York using her adept skills in color, texture and fabrication. It was not until she came to USC SCA’s John C. Hench Division of Animation + Digital Arts, where she learned and came to love the art of stock motion. She soon came up with “A Poem by Alba,” a touching story about a lonely elderly woman who became a pedestal on her journey for a fellowship. Her blog continues to fill up with animations, fabrications and drawings. Now, Lee is proud to introduce herself as a writer, animator and director. 
Alana Bright 
The coronavirus hindered the dreams of many but it didn’t affect the musical spirit of this very talented musical freshman. In fact, Alana Bright, a freshman majoring in musical theatre, decided to take up Laura Benanti’s #SunshineSongs challenge.
Talent paid off and her compelling musical performance was one of seven that was featured in the HBO Max documentary “Homeschool Musical: Class of 2020.” Bright aimed to share the topic of Black joy and the impact of George Floyd’s death throughout the self-shot documentary. Eventually, she sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” in celebration of Black culture and identity. As a college freshman, Bright’s aspirations motivate current high school seniors to seek out their passions despite the coronavirus. Make sure to watch this exclusive documentary opportunity turned incredible musical journey on HBO Max.
Nia Sarfo
Inspired by her role model, Pulitzer Prize winning playwright August Wilson, Nia Sarfo defied pessimistic stereotypes about Black women in “Giving Voice.” She was one of six students featured in this Netflix documentary, which captured their efforts through the 2018 August Wilson Monologue Competition. This required commitment and devotion to celebrating Black heritage through the lyrical art of poetry. Portraying Molly Cunningham from “Joe Turner’s Come and Gone,” Sarfo won first place in the Chicago regionals and second place in the national finals in New York City. She honored Wilson’s work, shocked and ecstatic about his profound dreams and visions. As a sophomore majoring in musical theatre, Sarfo hopes to incorporate her drama experience from “Giving Voice” in future performances and undeniably strive for better. 
Jensen McRae
USC alumnae Jensen McRae became an internet sensation on Twitter when she posted a short cover of a Phoebe Bridgers parody about getting the coronavirus vaccine. Within days of her viral tweet, Jensen worked with her team and producer Rahki, to complete the post-coronavirus vaccination anthem. From the start of her music career, McRae voiced microaggressions and interracial relationships, conveying empathic emotions to resonate with her fans. Her recent hit, “Immune,” appropriately cradles the anxiety and anticipation of listeners waiting for the end of this pandemic and its woes. With her guitar and journals, McRae demonstrates the breathtaking power of poetic lyrics and harmonious melodies. 
Gabriella Schultze
Ballet by day, biology by night. Despite the toll of online classes, Gabriella Schultze, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, finds a sprouting opportunity in the virtual courses that enable easy, remote access. During the day, Schultze trains for “Sleeping Beauty” while she studies biology at night. After deferring admission to USC twice before, Schultze treats this virtual convenience as a way to balance her academics with her passion for dancing. While she hopes for a successful dance career as the main body of Ballet West, Schultze also takes interest in genetic research. So far, this multitasker walks a path no one has ever walked before, treading the first footprint for many more to follow. How about leaving your comfort zone to try something daring and different?
Stacy L. Smith
Stacy L. Smith founded the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative to pave the way for equality in the entertainment industry. She has studied gender, race/ethnicity, the LGBTQ+ community, disabilities and mental health across film and television. Smith’s influence has spread from the powerful platforms of the United Nations, the White House, Sundance Film Festival and the Toronto Film Festival. Her venture towards inclusion is ceaseless. She successfully launched the 4% challenge to encourage others to hire female directors, from which developed the docuseries “4%: Film’s Gender Problem.” Smith emboldens a cause and a will to fight, provoking many undergraduates to conduct research investigations about inequality under her guidance.

Truth be told, there’s a lot of reasons to hate the wellness movement. Let’s start easy. I think many of us know what it feels like to open Instagram to a tirade of wellness influencers beaming ear-to-ear as they gear up for another day of competing in the Productivity Olympics. Kale smoothies. Morning meditation. Chakra realignment. Hot yoga. Regular yoga. It can feel overwhelming, to say the least. 
What if we look a little deeper? The lifestyle that the mainstream wellness movement encourages its followers to ascribe to is an expensive and pretty inaccessible one. It caters predominantly to white and affluent demographics, often reinforcing Western beauty standards while alienating marginalized communities from the wellness rhetoric. Beyond this, diet and exercise culture has taken the place of weight loss mania in a similar sense to how skin care has stolen the commercial spotlight from makeup. Same evil, different mask.
What if we look a lot deeper? What if we, say, analyze how the social media wellness movement holds up under scientific scrutiny? Spoiler alert: not too well.
From the moment we wake up and check our phones to when we turn them off before bed, we are force-fed the narrative that we have absolute control over our emotional state and mental and physical well-being. Influencers and wellness platforms sell us a dream by convincing us to invest in products and habits ostensibly promoted as causal links in the wellness chain. A 10-day cleanse here and some vitamin supplements there should do the trick, they tell us, hiding behind sponsorships and paid advertisements. 
Not only has wellness rhetoric on social media reduced mental health talking points to aesthetically pleasing graphics and catchy one-liners, it has also twisted (and at times directly contradicted) established scientific research at the cost of the well-being of those it is purported to help. Let me be blunt: The underlying philosophy of the wellness movement does not prepare its subscribers for the arbitrary and egregious unfairness of the real world.
Let’s talk genetics. Each gene in your body has two alleles, one from each parent. There is a particular gene called a serotonin transporter gene, and it ensures that the serotonin in our brain (the neurotransmitter implicated in mood stabilization, feelings of well-being and happiness) gets to where it needs to go to produce those positive effects. Now, this gene comes in two sizes: long and short. Two long alleles is a best-case scenario; this form of the gene makes you less susceptible to stress and more resilient in the face of trauma. One short and one long puts you somewhere in the middle. But get shafted with two short alleles and risk of developing major depressive disorder jumps steeply. 
There’s no punchline there — some people get lucky and some don’t. Some people are born equipped with genetic weaponry and some are not.
This isn’t to say that we have no agency or that our biological fate is predetermined. Rather, the takeaway is that we all start our lives from highly unique genetic baselines and that the overgeneralized “wellness” model, what with its emphasis on learned mental fortitude, does not account for these individual differences. 
But individual differences do not stop at genetic makeup. The biopsychosocial model is a relatively new and interdisciplinary framework that considers the interconnection between biology, psychology and socio-environmental factors in determining a person’s medical state.
Take chronic heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. You can be biologically predisposed to cardiovascular problems (genetic susceptibility), but psychological factors (adherence to medication use, monitoring of symptoms, etc.) and social factors (stress, socioeconomic status, etc.) can influence the progression and severity of illness. No one set of indicators alone is sufficient; it is the interaction among them that tells a holistic story.
This brings us right to research on adverse childhood experiences, better known in the psychology world as ACEs. ACEs range from childhood abuse (physical, sexual or emotional) to living with household members who are substance abusers, mentally ill, suicidal or incarcerated, among other factors. In a groundbreaking longitudinal study by Felitti et al. in 1998, researchers found a strong relationship between the breadth of exposure to ACEs during childhood and risk factors for several of the leading causes of death in adults. 
ACEs are stressful. While stress is the body’s way of protecting itself from external and internal threats, repeated activation of the body’s stress response can lead to suppressed immune function, declines in brain functioning and poor sleep habits. In a study on the long-term effects of childhood trauma on the brain, researchers found that children who grow up in families high in conflict or criticism and low in warmth and nurturance were more likely to have depression, cancer, lung disease, heart disease and diabetes as adults compared to those who did not.
Again, the message here is not to do away with the wellness framework and accept that we are all powerless over external forces out of our control. But the idea that all mental afflictions are fixable with a handful of positive affirmations, a fruit smoothie and an Alo Yoga workout set has got to go. 
The harsh reality is that the wellness movement misses the mark in its presumption that anyone can bounce back from dysfunction at any time. For many people, the damage has already been done. For many people, the prospect of mental well-being is a pipe dream obfuscated by more pressing needs of food or income stability. For many people, no amount of wellness tips will do the trick. 
The call to action here is to divert attention away from the wellness movement and onto primary prevention initiatives that seek to prevent disease before it occurs. By increasing funding and accessibility to create programs that support families and offer mental health care in communities where they are lacking or stigmatized, we can cut the head off the snake. By increasing educational programming for children and adolescents, we can impart valuable health information at an age where individuals are more likely to retain and incorporate it into their identity. 
Point being: Our time, effort and funding ought to be focused on preventing health problems rather than retroactively managing them. Not only is this a far better use of resources, but it also accounts for the role of development in adverse health outcomes, something the wellness movement neglects entirely. We cannot only ask, “what can be done now?” We must ask, “what happened before?” “How did we get here?” “What can we do to stop this?”

After almost a year of intense practice and constantly playing music, Haiden Henderson, known simply as Haiden, released his first single, “Want to Want You,” on March 11. He started the song at the beginning of the pandemic, but it has taken on a whole new identity since then, as Haiden, a junior majoring in music industry, has grown personally and musically. 
When Haiden was accepted into USC he deferred his admission for a year for financial reasons, and instead attended community college in Santa Barbara. In his first year after moving from Ojai, CA, Haiden slept in the back of his car, bouncing from place to place for the sake of his personal and career development. Money was tight and sleeping in his car for a year allowed him to save up for a USC tuition, while also refocusing his priorities.
“I think I wanted to do it consciously because I felt myself wanting to take two showers a day and getting kind of caught up in the little details of social media stuff,” Haiden said. “And that was when I started picking up the guitar.”
Long before he dedicated himself to music, Haiden had been a model for several years before that, starting in his junior year of high school. This wasn’t the right fit for him though, which was part of the reason for his reinvention when he came to Los Angeles. 
When Haiden came to USC as a sophomore in 2019, his major was aerospace engineering.
Jonah Mazer, a freshman majoring in production and accomplished producer (Mazer Productions, Living Records and Skye Blue Productions), however, knew Haiden had the potential for something greater. Mazer met Haiden when he was still new to L.A. They worked together to put on mini concerts through Living Records, at the Flow House which Haiden emcee’d.
“[Haiden] is so kind and humble and like he’s just one of the nicest people ever,” Mazer said. “I mean he’s he’s such a dope rocker kind of kid, someone you totally expect to be in like a ’70s rock rocker film.”
The rocker persona wasn’t always at the forefront; playing the guitar, which had been a casual interest in Haiden’s childhood, became a necessary distraction from his major, which wasn’t something that fulfilled him. In his past, he did things because he thought they would sound impressive to other people, which is why he decided at first to pursue STEM. But after spending time in college, he was convinced by his new music friends and connections that he made at USC that he should pursue music.
“And after like, a year at USC, I made a lot of music friends, and was writing songs regularly,” Haiden said.“And they kind of convinced me ‘Hey, jump off the bridge, man. It’s pretty nice down here.’”
After he was convinced that music was a viable career option, Haiden became obsessed. He doesn’t do anything in moderation — his whole life has been spent devoting all his time to one subject or another. When he was a kid, it was magic tricks. Later, it was engineering. 
Haiden’s mom, Misti Henderson, agreed, saying “he rarely does something that he doesn’t do entirely … He just can be so disciplined, and disciplined enough to spend 10, 12, 14 hours at something in a day.”  But music was completely different for him, according to Misti.
“I noticed that it felt different because it wasn’t something that I could just get really good at in a couple months and then give up,  I am constantly learning more about it, and learning more about myself as I go deeper into it,” Haiden said. 
This concentration and passion had its consequences though. When Haiden was a toddler, he had a trigger finger, which limits mobility of the hand, and had to have surgery. Interestingly enough, this is very rare in children, and is usually only seen in the elderly, Misti said. It wasn’t an issue again until he started playing guitar for hours a day.
One morning, he woke up and couldn’t open his hand, and the doctor told him he had to stop playing the guitar. Nevertheless, Misti recalls Haiden’s drive to continue playing music,.
“He was totally determined,” Misti said. “He’s like, I’ll do physical therapy, and I’ll ice and all, whatever I need to do.” 
Haiden didn’t stop playing guitar, but this struggle with his hands led him in a different direction:  writing songs. 
Haiden’s passion extended to specific artists when he was learning how to songwrite.
He was heavily influenced by the writing of Daniel Caesar, Sam Fender and John Mayer. Artists who made crooner music in the 1940s and ’50s, such as Bing Crosby and Louis Armstrong, were inspirations for singing. FINNEAS and Justin Timberlake have been influences as of late, though the past year has been all about finding his own sound, independent of his music inspirations. He just had to find the right people to help him first. 
Barry Fowler, a 2020 USC graduate, was the producer to help Haiden find that unique sound. They met when Barry was working on a demo for a mutual friend, and Haiden played guitar for the track. They got along great, and decided to start working together.
“We tried to see the bright side of things … if we have to be stuck inside anyway.” Fowler said. “Both of us wish we had more time to work on music. So we were like, well, now we do.” 
As a result of the pandemic, they decided to quarantine together and work on music constantly. The two were working from 8 a.m. to midnight most days a week for months, so Haiden decided to sleep on the studio floor, allowing him to truly immerse himself in the music — working all day, every day. 
Haiden describes Barry as one of his closest friends in L.A., and someone who has shaped his music tremendously.
“Barry helps me a lot,” Haiden said. “He doesn’t want to do 100 vocal takes. When I try to force him to, he’d rather do 10 if and if I don’t get it by 10 I’m probably not going to get it in 30. So let’s just chill, do it another day, when I’m not thinking about it as much.”
Haiden didn’t mind quarantining with Barry, describing himself as “well suited” for the pandemic lifestyle, as a sort of recluse. The pandemic gave him the unique opportunity to work on music constantly. At the beginning of his songwriting career, he would write one song a day, though he admits that most of these were not great. Now, his pace is more one song a week, and these songs mean a lot more to him. 
“In every one of them, I feel something in them, and it makes me feel a lot better about them,” Haiden said. “So it’s given me more confidence to slow down and understand that if I’m not feeling it that day, it’s fine. Creativity is not a science as much as I try to make it. And I just, it’s made me a little more patient.” 
Haiden describes his music making process as similar to “Frankenstein.” After spending so much time on songs he doesn’t use initially, he enjoys repurposing bits and pieces that he spent a lot of time on, to make whole new songs. “Want to Want You,” specifically, went through a major rewrite. 
“In the beginning, I felt like I had to outsmart the listener as opposed to just relate to them,” Haiden said. “And as a result, most of my music sounded like I was trying to hack something as opposed to just reaching out and talking to people … At first, I was looking outwards for a song topic, but it ended up just being more introspective, which made it feel authentic to me.” 
Haiden’s new single was released March 11. Before releasing any music, however, he doesn’t let anyone listen to his songs until they are  absolutely perfect, because he sees his music as an extension of himself. Haiden describes “Want to Want You” as his most personal project to date, but the young artist has more singles coming out soon, as well as an album down the pipeline. Haiden is optimistic, but cautious about his future. 
“I hope that if I do reach some form of success, it’s because I’m doing what I feel is most important to me,” Haiden said. “I would think that if you can get by doing what feels most comfortable for you and feels most like yourself, then you’re going to be much happier than if you’re faking it and being successful in something else.”

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced its official nominations for the 2021 ceremony Monday. While these monumental nominations celebrate films of the last year, it’s also important to take a look at the state of cinema right now. The Academy’s announcement comes nearly a year after theaters shut down across the nation due to the coronavirus. Aside from a couple of bursts of business, the American theatrical industry has widely remained non-existent during this new age.
Without traditional box office and shared cinema experiences, 2020’s films have largely been viewed at home, akin to television and streaming. The experiential nature of cinema has always been tied to the communal energy of a theatre. Now,that it has been replaced with small living rooms, the line between film and TV viewing experience has blurred almost completely.
2020 has pushed cinema to the brink, removing its unifying impact on society for nearly a year. As one of the most affordable entertainment experiences, cinema has always allowed people of different races, classes, origins and political views to come together and speak the same language — the language of stories, characters and drama. So, one of the most isolated years in recent human history was only made lonelier with the absence of any theaters to bring us together to celebrate cinema.
Making History
Regardless of the state of the theaters, the 2021 Oscar nominations have arrived, promising to honor this unique year of film just like any other. Overall, there is a very large spread of films that are represented in many of the categories.
At the top, “Mank” leads the pack with a stellar total of 10 nominations. Next up, there are six films taking up six nominations each, including “The Father,” “Judas and the Black Messiah,” “Minari,” “Nomadland,” “Sound of Metal” and “The Trial of the Chicago 7.” Rounding out with five nominations each, “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” and “Promising Young Woman” also join these ranks. Aside from “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” these films all represent the Best Picture nominees of this year.
This year, the Oscars also made history by triumphantly showcasing more diverse filmmaking than ever before. “Judas and the Black Messiah” became the first film to be nominated for Best Picture with an all-Black producing team. With Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”) and Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”), the Oscars nominated more than one woman for best director for the very first time. Zhao, the clear frontrunner for Best Director, also became the first woman to have four Oscar nominations in one year. Additionally, Fennell became the first woman to be nominated for her directorial debut.
When it came to the actors’ branch, nine out of the 20 nominees were all people of color, making it the branch’s largest diverse representation yet. In particular, the lead actor category made strides with Riz Ahmed (“Sound of Metal”) and Steven Yeun (“Minari”), marking the first time two men of Asian heritage competed in the lead category together. Yeun also became the first Asian American to be nominated in the category, while Ahmed became the first Muslim to do so. Meanwhile, Viola Davis (“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”) became the most nominated Black actress in history.  
Surprises
This year, most of the nominations were fairly predictable and expected, but there were some notable surprises. The biggest shock came with the inclusion of Danish director Thomas Vinterberg (“Another Round”) in the Best Director lineup. Vinterberg has been largely absent in the awards circuit for his international feature aside from his British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards nomination. 
Lakeith Stanfield (“Judas and the Black Messiah”) was also a surprise with his nomination in Best Supporting Actor, particularly since the studio has been campaigning him in the lead category. Stanfield joined his castmate Daniel Kaluuya (“Judas and the Black Messiah”) in the category. Additionally, Glenn Close (“Hillbilly Elegy”) made the cut for Best Supporting Actress, despite the film being largely panned by critics. Quite ironically, Close’s performance has also garnered a Razzie nomination for Worst Supporting Actress this year.
Snubs
Along with the surprises, this year’s Oscars definitely had its major snubs as well. Both “One Night in Miami…” and “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” were early locks for the Best Picture nominations but failed to make the cut. Additionally, Regina King (“One Night in Miami…”) was also snubbed from the Best Director lineup for her stellar directorial debut.
Even more so than King, famed writer-director Aaron Sorkin (“The Trial of the Chicago 7”) was expected to earn his first directing nomination this year but was snubbed. After his emotional speech following his win at the Critics’ Choice Awards, many wished young star Alan Kim (“Minari”) would be nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but those hopes were not fruitful.
And perhaps, the most controversial snub was of Delroy Lindo (“Da 5 Bloods”) who gave the performance of his career in Spike Lee’s last film and was seen as an early frontrunner. Neither Lindo nor Lee’s film saw much love from the Academy.
In Review
While there are surprises and snubs every year at the Oscars, this year made a bold statement on inclusivity and diversity in Hollywood. Streaming studios also dominated the nomination lineup. Netflix led with 35 nominations, with Amazon and Apple also getting a fair share of nominations this year, signaling a changing landscape. There is no way to know what the future holds, but the Oscar 2021 winners will definitely be revealed later this year on April 25.

The USC women’s soccer team will face city rivals UCLA Thursday at 7 p.m. on the back of two losses on the road against Utah and Colorado this past week, bearing a 2-3 conference record. 
After back-to-back victories against Oregon and Oregon State the previous weekend, where the Trojans managed consecutive clean sheets against their opponents, USC lost 2-0 to Utah. Despite leading in shots during the first half and shooting five times to the Utes’ three, USC conceded a brace to Utah junior forward Anna Escobedo in the second-half which finalized the bout in Salt Lake City.
USC opened Monday’s match against Colorado with purpose, with dynamic attacking duo senior forward Tara McKeown and junior forward Penelope Hocking providing a two-goal advantage in the first 14 minutes of play. Junior midfielder Madeline Vergura orchestrated both plays, providing width in her assists from a corner-kick and a lobbed pass. 
Colorado junior Libby Geraghty promptly responded with a goal in the 20th minute after having her initial shot blocked by USC senior goalkeeper Kaylie Collins. Senior midfielder Shanade Hopcroft equalized with a penalty kick in the 56th minute, eventually sending the match to overtime. 
USC senior Savannah DeMelo missed a pivotal penalty during the first overtime period, with Colorado’s freshman forward Shyra James’ shot in the box completing the Buffalos’ comeback in the second overtime period. 
“I actually thought the effort and intensity and the way we competed was what we have been looking forward to all season,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said in a phone interview with the Daily Trojan. “I really liked the spirit of the group today, soccer sometimes is a cruel game.” 
McKeown and Hocking continued their marauding form as they now combine for seven goals in the last six games. Vergura notched two early assists in her return to the starting lineup after coming from the bench in the previous two games.
The Trojans end their string of away games against contentious city rivals UCLA. The Bruins are basking in form after beating Utah 2-0 last Sunday, tallying their 5-0 conference record. UCLA has kept three clean sheets so far during conference play as they remain unbeaten at the moment. 
UCLA clinical sophomore forward Mia Fishel bears a 25% shot to goal conversion rate, having notched 3 goals in her last five games. In-form freshman forward Reilyn Turner finished with a brace in the Bruins’ last victory over Utah on Ute Field. 
USC’s last victory against UCLA dates back to six years ago when midfielder Morgan Andrews notched two second-half goals at UCLA’s Drake Stadium in Westwood. The Bruins won the last encounter in Nov. 2019, with a 4-2 scoreline, where Hocking’s goal and assist was not enough to overcome UCLA. 
McAlpine believes that the difference of form between the two teams will not determine the match between the local rivals.
“There’s a level of intensity and spirit about the [UCLA] game that makes it fun regardless of how well the teams are playing,” McAlpine said. “They are always close games … there’s always a lot of drama it seems — it will always be an exciting game and this one won’t be no different.” 
USC aims to end their two-game winless streak in the conference against UCLA, providing a turnaround of fortunes for the Trojans who enter the derby match with a .400 conference record. The Trojans will also meet UCLA again for their last match of the conference, playing at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum April 16. 
Despite the loss against Colorado, McAlpine hopes the performance rejuvenates the squad for their upcoming match against the Bruins. 
“I want a similar attitude and effort we had today, I think [Monday] was a building block for every game we play from here on out,” McAlpine said. “Getting back into some level of chemistry and consistency and showing that we can, first of all, compete and then start to strengthen together some moments in every game is really going to be the key for us.”
The No. 8 ranked Trojans will meet the No. 1 Bruins at the Wallis Annenberg Stadium Thursday. Kick-off is at 7 p.m.

Never had I once heard of the Dr. Seuss books that his estate pulled due to racist imagery. I have worked at a local bookstore for the past three years, and not once has anyone ever asked about these books. Then, last weekend, every other customer bombarded me with questions about their availability. I received an order for two copies of each underrated book. Suddenly, it seems that everyone wants to buy the racist Dr. Seuss books. 
Less than a week afterward, Oprah Winfrey conducted an intimate interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle and husband Harry, in which they discussed their departure from the British royal family. The CBS broadcast dropped bombshell after bombshell: Markle, a biracial Black woman, claimed the royal family refused to offer help when she had suicidal thoughts and Harry confessed to a conversation with a family member who expressed concern over the darkness of their son’s skin color. In response to public backlash, Prince William rebutted, positing that they are “very much not a racist family.” 
Both of these topics revolve around the much-disputed concept of cancel culture. Following the release of Winfrey’s interview, #AbolishTheMonarchy immediately trended on Twitter. In response to Dr. Seuss’ books, Kevin McCarthy read “Green Eggs and Ham” — a Dr. Seuss book not even among those pulled for racist imagery — aloud as a testament against cancel culture.
Although the sole purpose of cancel culture is accountability, we seem to digress from the systemically racist pasts of these issues. Who would have thought that the British monarchy — a relic of British imperialism — would exhibit racist tendencies? How does institutionalized racism condone this infatuation with the racist portrayals found in Dr. Seuss’ books? Ultimately, cancel culture sheds light on Western ethnocentrism and how it undermines the functionality of oppressive systems, particularly imperialism.
In the 16th century, the British Empire began to establish overseas colonies in the Americas and the West Indies. This colonization resulted in genocide of Indigenous peoples and the usurp of resources from occupied territories. Today, the aftermath of colonialism manifests in the form of what we refer to as the “Third World,” or underdeveloped countries, which are merely underdeveloped because they were colonized and oppressed by imperialist pursuits. These are the same countries who do not have adequate access to a coronavirus vaccine, and are monopolized by imperialist countries for wealth. 
Interestingly enough, it merely required a racist act, such as colorist concern over the skin of a baby, for everyone to suddenly step on the woke bus and vow to abolish the British monarchy. It’s even more ironic that Americans repost memes on social media about the Boston Tea Party along the lines of, “Meghan spilled the tea so America didn’t have to this time!” This should go without saying, but the United Kingdom is not the only imperialist country with a racist history. 
The British Empire laid the foundation for colonialism, with other economic powers, such as the United States following suit — colonizing territories in the Pacific, such as Hawaii, the Philippines and Guam. This determination to remain a world power and exert political and economic influence to other nations ingrained capitalism and greed into our framework. 
Yet, here we are, creating controversies over Dr. Seuss’ racist imagery. Of course, this media should not be disseminated anymore because it depicts dangerous racial biases. In the same vein, renaming “Robert E. Lee” schools and removing confederate statues are not products of “cancel culture” but instead addressing this despicable component of U.S. history rather than glorifying it. 
On the contrary, we can look at how Germany addressed their horrifying past — the Third Reich used institutional racism in the U.S. as a template for their own caste system that segregated Jews from Aryans. Now, the U.S. argues over cancel culture and reads “Green Eggs and Ham” when racist pasts emerge to the forefront; Germany illegalized the Nazi flag, banned all Nazi propaganda and considers Holocaust denial a crime. 
Not to mention the fact that in the middle of arguing over Dr. Seuss books that exhibit racism against Asian people, Asian Americans are experiencing increases in sinophobia and spikes in hate crimes by nearly 150% in major U.S. cities. We simply cannot look at the components of these racist attacks and just avow to hold perpetrators accountable — that will not resolve this vicious paradigm. 
Instead, accountability lies with the U.S. for perpetuating anti-Asian sentiment in the past century. The U.S.’ involvement in Vietnam, McCarthyism and the overall vilification of Asian people all ties back to the country’s imperialist motives to suppress threats to its political and economic prowess. 
We can also navigate the consequences of the U.S.’ imperialist motives through other racial inequities today. For example, we rarely talk about the Reagan Administration funding the Contra terrorist group to support their resistance against the Sandinista socialist government in Nicaragua. The Contra drug cartel is responsible for funneling crack cocaine into impoverished neighborhoods in South Central Los Angeles, which prompted Reagan’s War on Drugs.
In other words, the president who enacted the War on Drugs is also responsible for financially supporting the group who disseminated these drugs, and it was all in the name of imperialism. As a result, Black people face a justice system that over-polices low-income neighborhoods and disproportionately prosecutes them for minor drug crimes. Western motives to maintain control merely exacerbated our own racial hierarchies. 
It is far from surprising that Dr. Seuss will occupy so much of our energy that it distracts us from the monumental issues that perpetuate this absurd behavior. It is beyond expected that we would jump at the opportunity to cancel the British monarchy based on Markle’s experiences. At this point, cancel culture becomes minute. If we really wanted to “cancel” racism, we would have to completely restructure the national perception of imperialism, which is rooted in Western supremacy. Ignorance may be bliss, but for whom?

It should come as no surprise that USC is a PWI — a predominantly white institution. Just look at any given still-shot from a home football game. Or the Greek Row. Or any dining hall. USC’s colors may be red and gold, but its face is white. And there’s no lack of op-eds calling for increased diversity in student admissions and more transparency regarding the University’s advertising strategies — I’ve written one myself. However, what perhaps is less touched on is the lack of diversity in the University’s faculty. 
There should be more Black people, Indigenous people and people of color at USC in general.  However, the immediate concern is over the lack of Black, Indigenous and professors of color in underrepresented history and culture classes. From my own experience as a mixed race student at USC, having taken multiple courses in this area, all of them were taught by white professors. This could be explained as just one person’s experience; however, this sentiment is corroborated by many other students in similar situations. 
Unsurprisingly, 66% of USC’s faculty members are white — that’s 1,624 of the total 2,444 professors. Far, far behind is the next largest sector: Asian at 14%. Next follows Hispanic or Latinx and Unknown, both at 6%. Then, Black at 5%. Nonresident undocumented persons at 3%. Two or more races at 2%. American Indian or Alaska Native at less than 1%. 
These proportions are reflected across the nation. According to a 2019 study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, 80% of full-time professors at degree-granting postsecondary institutions were white while Black professors made up about 4%; Latinx, approximately 3%. 
Now, the counterargument for this would be: It is difficult to hire only Black and Indigenous professors and professors of color for these classes when, perhaps, the majority of the applicant pool is white. Then, there is the complaint about why institutions should ‘limit’ their hiring pool to underrepresented communities when there are so many white candidates who have the same credentials. 
So let’s unpack this. Why are there so many more white professors at schools like USC?
For one thing, there is the vibrant history of systemic oppression in this country. People of color have less access to education and academic resources, as well as opportunities. Just think: If your first concern is making money to provide for you and yours, you’re not going to choose a liberal arts field as your focus. Topics such as history and culture are ones of a certain level of privilege, which historically is not given to marginalized groups in this country. 
Accentuating this divide, there seems to be a historic trend of white people immersing themselves in liberal arts and higher education. This can’t be minimized to a recent trend — it has been going on since the birth of Eurocentric fields of social study. To be more specific, recall the beginnings of anthropology, where white people appropriated artifacts from other cultures for the sake of ‘science.’ If this seems too far off, then there is always the tendency of white people toward cultural appropriation.
All these factors culminate in a skewed system of higher education in which people are being taught an often inaccurate version of non-white history by nearly all white people. In addition, this system feeds into the white savior narrative, in which white people are the sole holders of history and culture. 
On March 1, Christopher Manning began serving as the University’s first chief inclusion and diversity officer. The move, by President Carol Folt, comes after enormous pushback against the administration following calls for accountability in regards to the University’s institutional systems of inequity and division. Hopefully, we will begin to see diversification in the University’s faculty as well as its student body.
This is not only a missed opportunity by USC to actually be as diverse as their PR team likes to portray in admission pamphlets but a serious disservice to their students. The importance of representation in universities cannot be overstated. Students come from all over the world in pursuit of an education. The idea of leaving one’s family, friends and hometown — of being supplanted in a new, foreign place — is already daunting. Add in that you’re still the minority, and everything looks pretty bleak. Seeing professors that look like you, that come from a similar background, proves a path to success. 
The terms of our present and future should not be dictated by the antiquated past. This is not the 1800s — a white face is not the right face. We must demand more of ourselves and the institutions we are part of in order to see real change. There are more than enough white voices telling BIPOC stories. It’s past time for change.
