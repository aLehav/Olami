Steve Sarkisian’s hiring last December meant the reinvigoration of the up-tempo, partially no-huddle offense in Troy. It also meant that for some of the largest guys on the football field at USC, life was about to get a lot more tiring. Opposing defenses will need to adjust to a faster pace from the Trojans next fall, but until then, USC’s defensive line is tasked with matching that pace after each snap and staying aggressive without becoming fatigued.
“It’s tiring, mentally more than anything,” said redshirt junior lineman Antwaun Woods, one of two returning starters on the line. “It’s hard on your body, but it’s going to become real, real good for us.”
If there was a position group that symbolized USC’s turbulent 2013 season and the offseason that followed, it would be the D-line. Preseason All-American candidate Morgan Breslin played just five games while fighting a hip injury, and on New Year’s Eve, George Uko made a somewhat surprising decision to enter the NFL Draft rather than return for his redshirt senior season.
On the coaching side, the position became a carousel. Ed Orgeron ceded the defensive line coaching spot to Pete Jenkins when Orgeron was promoted to interim head coach. Both left after the season, Orgeron in a huff after not being offered the permanent head job. In January, former Texas defensive line coach Bo Davis was brought in — or so we thought. He didn’t make it past the first day of classes in the spring semester before bolting for the same position at Alabama. In a cruel subplot, Davis left USC to become coworkers with Lane Kiffin, who now coaches the offense in Tuscaloosa.
That brought in Chris Wilson, hired from the same spot in Georgia, as the eventual position coach. The media and fans watched the hectic sequence play out from afar, but the whirlwind took its toll on USC’s linemen.
“I didn’t really want to see any new coaches, but I came to the conclusion that it’s part of football, so I had to deal with it,” junior defensive lineman Leonard Williams said. “Me and the new coach are on good terms, so I’m just taking in everything he’s telling me.”
One of those conversations has been on leadership, a quality that needs refreshing on the line after Uko and Devon Kennard’s departure.
“Coach has been expecting me to step up and be a leader, and to voice my opinion more,” Williams said.
Woods concurred with Williams, adding that the two needed to follow Uko’s example by being leaders in practices and on the field.
“[Uko] brought that leadership by his play and how he practiced,” Woods said. “[Leonard and I] just need to be more vocal and take over. We have to step up.”
Not only do they need to step up, but they also might be standing up a lot more this fall. The departed Clancy Pendergast’s defense ran a 5-2 scheme comprising five linemen, with three of those in a three-point stance on the line. With USC’s faster new offense, there’s simply no time to get into a stance. Instead, the defensive line has to read and react on a dime.
For one likely starting lineman, though, facing such an offense in practice is old hat.
“Coming from [Texas] Tech to last year to this year, it’s a transitioning thing,” said redshirt junior defensive lineman Delvon Simmons. “I’m pretty used to it, more than others are, but we still have to get used to running as many plays as we do.”
Simmons mentioned how he helps encourage his fellow linemen to keep up with the pace, and being eligible after sitting out last year due to transfer rules, he expects to be a big part of keeping ready on the field in the fall.
After practice last week, Woods and his fellow linemen looked gassed after scrimmaging to close out the practice. When you take into account the pace as well as USC’s impressive stable of running backs, four of whom could be starting Pac-12 backs today, it’s no surprise that the defensive players closest to the ball are being pushed to their limits.
“That’s part of why I went to USC,” Williams said. “I remember coming here out of high school, and they always told me that ‘going against great will make you great.’”
That’s a valuable mentality to have, because the practice pace is ample preparation for the type of offense becoming more prevalent in the Pac-12. Half of USC’s opponents for 2014 were in the Top 30 in plays per game in 2013, and that’s without USC facing the lightning-speed Oregon Ducks this fall.
“They run so many fast-tempo offenses [in the Pac-12] nowadays, so they’re definitely preparing us for game time,” Williams said. “It’s a good thing, but at the same time, you can tell a lot of people are tired out there.”
USC had 35 sacks and allowed just more than 120 rushing yards per game last year. Replacing the three starters will be a tall task, but if fatigue is USC’s biggest obstacle to D-line success, then it could be another special season up front.

This weekend, USC’s men’s tennis team picked up its first two Pac-12 wins of the season and secured its eighth straight 20-win season. With a 6-1 win over the No. 27 Oregon Ducks on Friday and another 6-1 win against the Washington Huskies on Saturday, the Trojans (20-2, 2-0) extended their winning streak to 11 consecutive matches.
Team effort · Senior captain Ray Sarmiento dropped back-to-back singles matches this weekend, but the Trojans still earned two victories. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The back-to-back games included plenty of challenges: a long road trip, four different plane rides, indoor matches for both games and no time to relax. Despite the conditions, head coach Peter Smith said the team succeeded because “they were always ready to go.”
The Trojans  put their win streak on the line against the  Ducks (14-3, 0-2), who entered the match having won 11 straight. USC’s power duo — and the nation’s No. 5 pairing — junior Yannick Hanfmann and senior Ray Sarmiento clinched the first win of the day on an 8-3 decision against Oregon’s Robin Cambier and Kevin Farin. Also coming in with a strong doubles win were sophomore Max de Vroome and junior Eric Johnson. The pair went 8-5 over Oregon’s Jayson Amos and Daniel Sardu, clinching the doubles point and securing an early 1-0 lead for the Trojans.
In singles, No. 100 de Vroome completed his match first, netting a 6-2, 6-4 win over Sardu. Johnson finished second, beating Joey Swaysland 6-3, 6-4 bumping up the Trojans to a 3-0 lead. Hanfmann, ranked No. 12 in the nation, faced Farin and won, 6-4, 6-4, to clinch the match for USC.
Oregon’s only chance to put a point on the board was against No. 3 Sarmiento, who played against No. 113 Cambier. Cambier dug himself out of a one-set hole, upsetting Sarmiento with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 score. No. 56 Roberto Quiroz led the Trojans to a strong finish, however, wrapping up his match against Daan Maasland 7-5, 7-5.
Along with the number of conditions the team had to adapt to, Smith once again emphasized challenging the team himself.
“[I’ve been] sitting guys, making other guys play, doing different things,” Smith said. “Being comfortable is great, but adversity makes your grow. Life and sports are the same.”
In Seattle, the reign of Troy continued, as the Trojans secured a 2-0 start in conference play. Against Washington (9-9, 0-2), the Trojans showed their strength in both power plays and versatility, completing near perfect matches in both doubles and singles sets.
In doubles, freshman Nick Crystal and junior Quiroz, a fairly new pairing, pulled off the first win of the day with an 8-3 victory.
“Nick’s been giving us a spark,” Smith said. “He’s super feisty, and most of the time that’s good. He’s been a real surprise.”
Their win was followed by another valiant effort by their teammates — Hanfmann and Sarmiento secured the 1-0 advantage with an 8-5 decision.
Though this type of consistency continued on most of the courts in singles play, the last matchup proved the most challenging for USC.
Sarmiento and unranked Emmett Egger would go into a 10-point tiebreaker after Sarmiento ceded the second set to his opponent again. Egger pulled off an upset on a 6-7 (5), 6-3, 1-0 (10-4) comeback over Sarmiento, handing the senior captain his second loss of the trip and his first back-to-back losses of the season.
“[Sarmiento has] been changing his racquet, and stuff like that caught up with him this weekend,” Smith said. “But stuff like that is going to happen to anyone, and Ray’s a senior, he’s captain, so that happening to Ray [and not other players] is the best thing.”
The Trojans rode the waves of their wins into singles against Washington; Hanfmann outplayed Max Manthou with a 6-0, 6-3 win, leading to a 2-0 lead for USC.
Following suit, de Vroome dominated his match, for a 6-3, 6-3 win over Jeff Hawke. Quiroz topped Gal Hakak with a 6-2, 6-2 win, clinching the match for the Trojans. The victory was the 10th straight for the talented Ecuadorian. Senior captain Michael Grant completed a stunning second set against Viktor Farkas, winning it 7-5, 6-0 to close out the match.
Next weekend, USC returns home to host Stanford at 1:30 p.m. on Friday before facing California on Saturday at Marks Stadium.

Notching two national titles, the Trojans placed eighth out of ten teams in the three-day NCAA Men’s Swimming and Diving Championships in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
Out with a bang · Senior swimmer Cristian Quintero won his first-ever NCAA title over the weekend, finishing first in the 500-yard free. The Venezuelan also finished second in the 200-yard free and third in the 100-yard free. – Will Ehart | Daily Trojan
“We were disappointed to finish eighth after taking fourth last year, but we came away with two national titles and a lot of experience for next year’s team to build upon,” head coach Dave Salo told USC Trojans. “Cristian has been a workhorse all season long and put up some great performances to lead the team.”
Though senior Cristian Quintero helped the Trojans land their fourth consecutive top-eight finish over the weekend, the team dropped four spots from its championship performance last year. USC entered the weekend ranked No. 4 in the nation, justifying Salo’s frustration with an eighth-place finish. The Trojans ended the meet with 182 points, beating Stanford and Indiana in the rankings. California won the overall team title with 468.5 points.
Despite a perhaps disappointing overall finish, the meet was not without its resounding triumphs. Quintero, freshmen Reed Malone and Dylan Carter and senior Dimitri Colupaev cruised through the 800-yard free relay, securing USC’s first NCAA title in the event since 2002 and its eighth in program history. The quartet’s 6:13.09 was just more than a half-second off USC’s all-time record.
Quintero, inarguably the team’s leader, didn’t leave his last NCAA championship without securing his own personal victories. The senior won his first career NCAA title in what would be his last 500y free race, and by a sizable margin. Quintero clocked in at 4:10.02, just .22 seconds off of USC’s record time in the race. Quintero sustained at least a one-second lead on his opponents, finishing with a time that made him the eighth-fastest swimmer ever in the race.
“I feel awesome,” Quintero told USC Trojans after his victory. “Since the beginning I felt really strong. I knew I had this. I had this in me all the time. I’m really proud of this. I’m really glad with my last performance. It was my last 500 free and I really wanted to make a good performance and I did.”
Quintero finished second in the 200y free and third in the 100y free and helped guide his relay team, comprising Colupaev, senior Jack Wagner and freshman Santo Condorelli, to sixth place in the 400y free.
The Caracas, Venezuela native is the first Trojan to win All-American honors in the 100y, 200y and 500y free events since USC’s Hungarian Olympian Bela Szabados accomplished the feat in 1999.
Other Trojans who got into the scoring mix include sophomore Ted Singley and junior Cary Wright, who went 26-27 in the 1650y free.
Junior Luca Spinazzola placed 26th in the 200y back and junior Andrew Malone was 36th in the 200y breast.

On March 18, swarms of angry girls wearing leggings could be seen in Evanston, Ill. No, this wasn’t a Lululemon factory sale. Rather, it was students protesting against a proposed school dress code to ban leggings and yoga pants at Haven Middle School, according to the Evanston Review.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
The drama began when students claimed they had been told they weren’t allowed to wear leggings because they were too provocative. Student Sophie Hasty told the Evanston Review that administrators said the stretchy — and not always opaque — garment was “too distracting to boys.”
The school’s course of action was a valid one, but the issue is the reasoning behind it. Administrators have every right to ban clothing they deem inappropriate. Different schools might take a variety of approaches in doing this, from going as far as instituting uniforms to barely enforcing the dress code, but it is within their jurisdiction to make sure students dress according to their standards.
This is also a good lesson for the students themselves. Girls must learn to be taken seriously, especially in the professional world, which requires maintaining a certain standard of dress. School, as the precursor to work, should require at least some level of appropriateness, preferably through a dress code that falls somewhere in the wide range between pajamas and business casual. This will benefit the students much more than the school.
The phrase “dress for success” isn’t just a dictum parroted by women’s self-help and lifestyle blogs — it’s an actual, scientifically proven phenomenon. A study conducted by Northwestern University showed how clothing affects the cognitive process in an effect known as “enclothed cognition,” according to The New York Times. The study, which was published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, showed that if someone wears a coat he or she believes to be a doctor’s coat, his or her attention span will improve.
If the motivation behind such dress codes does not come from this psychology, however, it must at least come from a requirement of respectability. Students should be asked to wear apparel that meets certain rules out of respect to their teachers, their administrators and even their peers. None of these demands should have anything to do with adolescent boys and their possibly wandering eyes. The idea that the burden of making sure boys stay on task should be placed on girls and their apparel is simply ludicrous and perpetuates society’s idea that girls have a responsibility not to “tempt” the opposite sex.
This idea isn’t new; in fact, it has repeatedly arisen in different areas of society. In many Islamic countries, women must wear coverings ranging from a hijab to a niqab. In the United States, women are blamed in cases of rape because they were “asking for it” by what they were wearing, in what has been deemed a part of “rape culture.”
Wearing leggings without a top or dress that’s long enough should be seen as bad taste, but not because it distracts middle school boys. Not only does having to think about the opposite sex create an unfair burden on girls’ right to express themselves through their clothing, but it also gives boys no credit.
It appears Principal Kathleen Roberson realized the school’s mistake after the protest. According to the Evanston & Skokie school district, Roberson sent a letter home to parents telling them that “the enforcement of the dress code is not in response to the perceived distraction certain clothing may or may not cause and is not a mechanism in which to place blame,” but rather “an effort to maintain a respectful learning environment for all.”
Let’s hope that’s true.

I’m confused as to how it is “bad taste” for a 12-year-old to wear leggings? Also, why should a junior high girl’s choice of pants determine how seriously she is taken?

Sunnie Kahle is just like most 8-year-olds. She enjoys school as much as she enjoys play. She loves seeing her friends each day and coming home to a loving family.
But Timberlake Christian School found a glaring problem with Kahle. Though she’s a good student with excellent behavior, Kahle did not reflect society’s expectations of femininity.
Sunnie Kahle is a girl. But to Timberlake Christian School, she didn’t exactly look like one. Her jeans and loose-fitting shirts, her cropped hair and distaste for girly activities frustrated the school’s administration.
New York Daily News reported that Timberlake Christian School wrote to Kahle’s grandparents, stating that they will not allow Kahle to re-enroll unless her exterior appearance changes.
In the letter, Principal Becky Bowman admitted that Kahle was a “bright girl,” but argued that she did not abide by biblical standards in the way that she dressed, and thus did not deserve a place at the school.
“How do you label a child, eight years old, or discriminate against an eight-year-old child?” Carroll Thompson, Kahle’s grandmother and legal guardian, told WSET.
Thompson’s outrage is warranted. Institutions such as Kahle’s school should not have free reign to encourage intolerance. Though private schools are usually given the authority to dictate their own dress code, that should not qualify as a blank check to make an innocent girl, or anyone for that matter, feel so inferior. Furthermore, Timberlake Christian School has no place to assume and criticize Kahle’s sexual identity — after all, Kahle is only 8 years old.
Backlash against the school’s actions has been severe, with dozens of news outlets covering the story.Readers have taken to defending Kahle’s looks and chastising Timberlake Christian for its evident prejudice.
But Kahle’s case illuminates a greater problem — the prevalence of gender stereotypes and their negative impact upon us. Every day, we see people’s narrow-mindedness toward those who do not conform to expected gender stereotypes. Both men and women, from birth, are conditioned to behave in certain ways: Little girls are encouraged to wear pretty pink bows in their hair and little boys are taught the value of blue light-up shoes and lightsabers.
Granted, change has begun in small ways. According to The New York Times, toymaker Hasbro has started marketing play weaponry such as bows and arrows and Nerf guns to young girls, attempting to shatter the stereotype that acting tough is a man’s job.
But the bigger problems will not cease to exist when we continue to tell young boys to “man up” when they do not play rough, even going as far as to ridicule a child who does not seem to enjoy what his or her peers typically do.
If a boy  wants to play with a kitchen set rather than a football, it shouldn’t matter. If a girl wants to collect Hot Wheels rather than Barbies, it should make no difference.
In a way, I speak from personal experience. Though some of my peers took dance classes and art lessons, I loved playing video games with my neighbors and playing basketball in the sun. I’m grateful to have open-minded parents who never questioned my future or my character based on these activities.
The way I see it, we can all relate to Kahle’s struggle. We have all felt misunderstood at times and we’ve all been judged by our covers alone. It’s now up to us to slowly eradicate the conventional standards society has set for others.
Ultimately, insulting those who veer from the supposed norm does no good for the world; we’re not going to solve any problems or find any progress by molding individuals into our notions of each gender. Instead of encouraging young girls and boys or men and women to behave or dress in accordance with societal expectations, we should focus on cultivating characteristics beneficial to each person’s future. Intelligence is not measured by the amount of mascara one applies each day; compassion is not measured by the quality of a suit and tie or skirt length.
In fact, our judgements of people’s exterior appearances often reflect gross misunderstandings. Kahle cut her long locks to donate to a cancer patient, according to ABC News. But at the end of the day, it shouldn’t matter for what purpose individuals dress a certain way. Frankly, it’s ludicrous to dictate how others should dress or behave if their actions cause no harm.
In Sunnie Kahle’s eyes, there’s a look of love and gentleness. If there’s one thing to take away from this story, perhaps it is the message that regardless of what she wears or who she loves one day, Kahle will be a better person than many of the individuals in this world — and remembering this will help us read further, rather than stopping at a cover.

Is virtual reality the next arms race in entertainment technology?
Facebook certainly seems to think so. Shortly after Oculus VR opened up pre-orders for the Rift Development Kit 2 and Sony’s revelation of Project Morpheus, a virtual reality headset that would sync with Playstation 4, the social media conglomerate bought the tech upstart for $2 billion, a remarkable amount considering just two years ago Oculus VR was asking for $250,000 on Kickstarter and ended up with $2.5M.
There’s good reason for Facebook to invest: Not until the Oculus Rift did the idea of a marketable and approachable VR-device seem viable, or at least practical. Bring up a virtual reality gaming device and the first thought, unfortunately, goes to the Nintendo Virtual Boy, which was nothing short of a disaster and has put a permanent mark on the idea of a commercial virtual reality device.
Nintendo’s Virtual Boy failed because it made every single mistake a VR-device could do: It was difficult to wear, the graphics were dreadful, the battery life was miniscule and Nintendo even had a warning on the device recommending not to spend more than 30 minutes playing a game. Considering that the graphics were the equivalent of staring at red lasers, eye strain was to be expected.
The Oculus Rift has been a niche hit among game developers and programmers. Since it’s still in the prototype stage, a person can’t just easily plug it into his or her PC and play it right away. Someone has to know how to program to get it to work, which is great for people who know how to code but has kept it from mass adoption.
The Dev Kit 2 does introduce many great amenities, such as 1080p resolution, head-tracking for Z-dimensional immersion and display technologies that help to prevent motion sickness. It’s still not close to being a “commercial” product as much as a developmental product.
Therefore, a $2 billion evaluation for a company that hasn’t even released a retail product yet might seem a bit ridiculous, even reckless, on the part of Facebook. In the deal’s press release, however, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated  that the company is looking beyond the gaming capabilities of the device and looking ahead at the potential of virtual reality, especially in the field of social media.
The Oculus Rift has already expanded beyond game immersion and into literal VR-simulations, both practical and experimental. The U.S. Navy has been developing the Enhanced Environment for Communication and Collaboration (codenamed BlueShark) right here at USC’s Institute for Creative Technologies, with the intent to explore future immersive technology. Facebook’s interest in the company shows that it believes that the next stage of interaction is in the virtual field.
Of course, competition begets products trying to improve over each other. Sony’s Project Morpheus already has the infrastructure with the PlayStation Move and Camera, which means that they already have a virtual environment. Microsoft responded to the announcement of Project Morpheus and Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus VR by saying that they’ve been working on VR-technology for years and recently purchased a company that specializes in augmented-reality headsets. Google already has Google Glass, which has used augmented reality for both exploratory and entertainment purposes.
The presence of Facebook with Oculus had a generally negative response from the gaming community, with many fearing that the company will distract Oculus from its original goal of creating a genuine VR-gaming experience. Though Zuckerberg has stated that the company will continue to focus on gaming, the writing’s on the wall that virtual reality is eventually going to have to move beyond being a gaming gimmick.
All of these companies have to once and for all convince a skeptical public that wearing a device on one’s face is not only a necessary but a compelling reason to dive into the virtual world. Beyond factors such as price, weight and wide developmental support, it will remain to be seen if VR can overcome those drawbacks and push entertainment and social interaction into the next dimension.

After being confined to the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom last year by USC’s new security requirements, KXSC Fest made a triumphant return to the outdoors on Saturday. Founders Park was filled with local families, USC students and a considerable number of fans who made the trip just to see their favorite performers. For those unfamiliar with or uninterested in the musical guests, there were art installations, food trucks and all kinds of small vendors set up across the lawn. This year’s KXSC Fest truly had something for everyone.
The music kicked off around 5:00 p.m. with power-pop group Tempest le Mans. The five-person outfit is comprised entirely of USC students. Somewhere between the ’70s swagger of Fleetwood Mac and the dry, self-deprecating style of Belle & Sebastian, Tempest’s laidback harmonies were the perfect background to the wandering crowds of local children playing and curious students starting to arrive. Tempest also had a more in-your-face side, displayed during its last song, “A Lamb,” which was named after singer Nathan Castiel’s favorite meat. The tune ended with a raucous drum solo from Paul Carter that was finally cut off by his bandmates physically removing the cymbals from his drum set and the sticks from his hands. Castiel then went on in a sardonic tone to thank his many sponsors, “KXSC, USC, USG, USA, USB … US … Y.”
As the sun came down, the vibe gradually changed from family-friendly rock concert to a hip L.A. nightclub where dancing and revelry were encouraged. The group Breakfast and singer Kirin J. Callinan, though widely different in style, both helped with this transition. Breakfast captured the spacey synth sounds popular with so many audiences today, ending with an ethereal version of Cher’s “Believe.” Kirin J. Callinan’s set was quite a jump from Breakfast’s understated grooves. The baritone crooner donned a military uniform and talked/sang over distorted guitar loops and loud bombs of sound that seemed to come out of nowhere. Imitating the strange, detached aesthetic of Joy Division, or maybe even Kraftwerk, Callinan was never boring or predictable.
Though many students seemed to love his noisy, avant-garde approach, those looking for some easier-to-digest fun found salvation in the variety of delicious food trucks.
Patrons had the choice between Kogi Truck and The Grilled Cheese Truck for lunch or dinner, and for dessert, many found their way to the Coolhaus Truck. Coolhaus makes tasty ice cream sandwiches of unusual flavors, such as sweet potato or Cinnamon Toast Crunch, complete with edible paper napkins, which seemed to confuse many customers.
Attendees also stopped at the tents set up for local artists and vendors. There was a tent devoted exclusively to robot art by Matthew Spangler (which was fitting, given KXSC’s robot mascot) as well as one tent selling art with laser-eyed cats in space. There were tents acting as a miniature vintage clothing thrift store, as well as one where people could try out SubPac, a backpack that connects to a music source and emits low frequency vibrations according to the song. This wide variety of non-musical attractions kept people in Founders Park during the set-up between acts.
These distractions proved necessary when the venue ran into sound trouble before both Sun Araw’s and special guest Jessy Lanza’s performances. They worked it out in a timely manner, however, and Sun Araw — also known as Cameron Stallones — and Lanza went on to play without a hitch. Supported by a DJ friend, Sun Araw’s experimental blend of chillwave, trip hop and psychedelic rock hypnotized the crowd and prepped them for the dance-heavy acts that were to come.
The final two sets, Jessy Lanza and DJ Rashad with DJ Spinn, are DJ acts in two very different senses of the word. Evoking obvious comparisons to fellow female DJ Grimes, Lanza’s ethereal synths and floating vocals captured the zeitgeist of the contemporary interpretation of what it means to be a DJ. Headliners DJ Rashad and DJ Spinn, however, took spinning back to its roots with their Chicago-based dancehall style appropriately referred to as “footwork.” Their bombastic hip-hop samples spanned everything from Outkast to Kanye West, and this got by far the largest and most enthusiastic crowd response. Joined on stage by a dancer exemplifying authentic Chicago footwork, Rashad and Spinn had smiles on their faces the entire set, encouraging the crowd to let loose.
From the time it started,  KXSC Fest gradually built up in both attendance and sonic intensity, until the headliners provided a wild and riotous climax to the packed lawn of Founders Park. The return to the outdoors allowed for bigger sets and more space. And despite the concerns of previous years, there was not a single security mishap. It felt like a step in the right direction for USC in terms of effectively integrating both students and the surrounding community into on-campus events.
Great article, Patrick! It’s great to see KXSC getting such high-quality coverage from the DT.

This Saturday, Camp Kesem held its first annual Make the Magic dinner at the Caruso Catholic Center.
The event served to both raise awareness of the organization’s mission and to fundraise for a weeklong camp for children whose parents are battling or have battled cancer.
“Since a lot of [the families] have expensive medical bills, they might not be able to pay for the camp otherwise.  By providing them this opportunity to go for free, it’s really beneficial to the kids,” said Sarah Loh, volunteer coordinator for Camp Kesem USC.
The event featured a cocktail hour in the Caruso Center courtyard, where guests in attendance mingled with student counselors and participated in a silent auction which helped raise money for the camp.
USC’s Camp Kesem chapter was founded in 2012 and was able to take 26 kids to camp this past summer. According to the national Camp Kesem website, there are more than 3 million children per year affected by a parent’s cancer. This year, by putting on events such as Make the Magic and pancake nights on The Row, Kesem hopes to raise $41,000  to bring twice as many kids this year. So far, Camp Kesem has raised about half of its goal. Because the organization is so new, it relies on donations from generous supporters to fund camp every summer.
“Camp Kesem started last year at USC … so we don’t have a lot of resources or outside funding that we can go to,” said Jehan Bista, a Camp Kesem counselor.
Many of the counselors shared their personal Camp Kesem stories during Make the Magic, including freshman Claire Witzke, who was a camper at Camp Kesem at Stanford and is now a counselor at Camp Kesem.
“Though the first week of camp was overwhelming, there was a weird sense of ease knowing that every camper had gone through a very similar experience to mine,” Witzke said. “They knew the anxiety of waiting for test results and the fear that the cancer had come back … Camp Kesem was one of the best thing that ever happened to me.”
During camp, kids get the chance to participate in a plethora of activities, both fun and supportive. One such activity is “Cabin Chats,” during which children are able to tell their stories to one another.
This year, Make the Magic welcomed 60 guests, including friends and family of the counselors and local hospital workers.
Though any organization’s event faces hardships within the first few years of existence, Camp Kesem has succeeded in overcoming the stigma of being a new organization and is growing at an exponential pace.

USC students and members of the community gathered on Cromwell Field this weekend to participate in Relay for Life, a 24-hour walkathon that raised $40,525 for the American Cancer Society.
Miss Relay · Eric Gaurderman, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering, participates in a pageant event during Relay for Life. – Christopher Roman | Daily Trojan
Campus organizations and individuals formed teams and pledged to have at least one member walking the track for the duration of the event, which began at noon on Saturday and concluded with a closing ceremony Sunday morning. For many students affected by cancer, the event was a chance to take action against the disease.
“The first day that I came to college, my grandpa passed away from cancer,” said Kim Artounian, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience. “I was driving up from Arizona to USC when we got the call and the first week I got involved with Colleges Against Cancer and Relay.”
Colleges Against Cancer is a national organization with chapters at many colleges and universities. At USC, the club sponsors a number of cancer related events. The biggest event of the year is Relay for Life, which involves almost a year of planning. Relay for Life is one of the biggest fundraisers for the American Cancer Society, with relays taking place around the world. Teams compete with each other to raise money before the event, and on-site fundraisers raise additional funds throughout the event.
“There was a man who just came back from a relay in Brazil, and he said he’s been to over 250 relays in his lifetime,” Artounian said. “He said he does it because the American Cancer Society supported him when he was battling cancer — that makes you realize how special the relays are.”
In addition to the 24-hour walk, there were several events throughout the day as entertainment for the participants. The event began with the Survivors Lap, in which cancer survivors took the inaugural lap to begin the relay.
Later in the day, the Luminaria ceremony was held. where candles were lit to remember the lives lost to cancer and those currently battling the disease. Teams also competed against each other in the Relay Olympics with mini-games such as a ring toss.
“This has been a transition year for us, and we did a lot of restructuring of the committee,” said Megan Trieu, the production chair for Relay for Life. “We’re trying to build and make this an even bigger event for next year.”
One change made this year was the addition of the Fight Back committee that encouraged students to take action against cancer beyond participating in the  relay. One example was donating hair, and students from the Paul Mitchell Cosmetology school volunteered to cut hair for students who wished to donate more than eight inches.
“It’s great to see the diversity of groups represented at Relay,” said Sarah Urke, a sophomore majoring in human biology. “You have really big groups like the band, but it was great to see some smaller organizations out here as well, and you could see USC and the surrounding community coming together to fight back against cancer.”

On Saturday, the 5th annual Women’s Empowerment Conference was held on USC’s campus, drawing nearly 100 high school girls who visited campus for a day of inspirational speakers and empowerment workshops.
‘Know your worth’ · Alanah Joseph, president of Maxwell Avenue, encouraged girls to take advantage of workplace changes regarding gender. – Macaul Hodge | Daily Trojan
The event was hosted by Maxwell Avenue, a fashion and lifestyle brand, in conjunction with USC TriO Educational Talent Search. The ETS is a nonprofit program unit, which aims to promote education and better living to kids from low-income backgrounds, and Maxwell Avenue’s brand name has become an emblem of female empowerment and accomplishment.
The  day began with keynote speaker Serena Watson, who is the editor-in-chief of women’s lifestyle magazine Made Woman Magazine. Watson is also a USC alumna and is a now a writer, producer and entrepreneur. Watson has applied her passions to becoming a spokeswoman and advocate for woman empowerment.
“Just to see and be able to talk to women who have been so successful is inspiring,” said Catherine Romo, a sophomore at Southeast High School. “They make you feel as if you can do it, too.”
Later in the day, the girls were able to get more involved in the conference through workshops. One was directed by a USC Department of Public Safety officer, and was both a self-defense lesson as well as a presentation on safety in general.
Another workshop consisted of a panel of successful women in the workplace. They were asked about their accomplishments, their struggles and how they have overcome the challenges associated with working in historically male-dominated fields.
“All you have control over is yourself,” said panelist Darcy Alvarez. “It all comes down to attitude.”
Alvarez has worked in finance, accounting and management in her position with Liberty Tax Service. She noted that confidence is key.
“Don’t let yourself become your own worst enemy,” Alvarez said. “You are there for a reason, and you deserve to be there.”
Another panelist, Colleen Charles, a civil engineer, said not to let the unfair discrepancy between men and women in the workplace be intimidating.
“As a civil engineer, I’ve found myself at meetings where often I am the only woman at the table. I’ve learned you can’t let that ratio intimidate you,” Charles said. “Instead, turn it into something productive. Let it empower you.”
Those in the audience were surprised about women’s lack of presence in the workforce.
“Only 20 of the ‘Fortune 500’ CEOs are women,” said workshop host and President of Maxwell Avenue Alanah Joseph.
She stressed that women statistically make less money than men, but trends are changing.
“Women only make 77 cents to every dollar earned by men,” Joseph said. “The scale is tipping, though. It’s important that we know our worth and, with that knowledge, have the confidence to ask for what we want. It’s the only way we’re going to get it.”
The mission of the conference was to empower, encourage and promote education, positive self-esteem and strong self-awareness. The young women who attended the event left the event with a sense of determination to make positive changes for women.
“I want to be an aerospace engineer and seeing engineers here makes me so happy,” said Diana Palafox, a 17-year-old student from Belmont High School in Westlake, Calif. “These women have shown me that even though that field is dominated by males, I can still go into it and have success.”
Joseph’s success in empowering women can be seen in the mindsets of the girls who attended the conference.
“This is my second year at the conference, and I think more women should attend,” said Jennifer Marroquin, a 17-year-old from Belmont High School. “They tell us that we are strong and beautiful women and that we can make something of ourselves. I don’t think women hear that enough.”
