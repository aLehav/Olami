With Tuesday’s Los Angeles mayoral primary over, runoff candidates Councilmember Eric Garcetti and City Controller Wendy Greuel must seek endorsements, experts said during a weekly political panel on Wednesday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.

The Student Talk Back discussion, hosted by the USC Dornsife College’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute, the USC Price Tomas Rivera Policy Institute and the USC Price Judith and John Bedrosian Center on Governance and Public Enterprise,  featured four panelists and was moderated by local political strategist Matt Rodriguez and Daily Trojan News Editor Yasmeen Serhan. Tuesday’s election resulted in Greuel and Garcetti advancing to the run-off election on May 21. Garcetti won 33 percent of the primary election vote and Greuel garnered 29 percent of the vote.
Panelists said Garcetti and Greuel’s must appeal to undecided voters in the next 11 weeks of the campaign. USC College Democrats President Aaron Taxy said that both Garcetti and Greuel will must vie for voters who previosly supported James Kevin and Jan Perry.
“Thirty-three percent of the electorate is undecided,” Taxy said. “Endorsements from Perry and James will be very important in determining who ultimately becomes the next mayor.”
All panelists agreed that endorsements — not issue positions — would be the deciding factor in the mayoral race.
“As we move forward, voters aren’t going to be as concerned with where Garcetti and Greuel stand on the issues, largely because they share many of the same positions,” said Communications and Media Relations Director for the Los Angeles Unified School District Thomas Waldman. “What matters now is who will be supporting whom, and whether you like that candidate or not.”
Waldman said an endorsement from outgoing Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa will be a distinctive factor in Garcetti or Greuel winning the election.
“If I were one of the candidates, I would be actively trying to get the mayor’s endorsement,” Waldman said. “He’s leaving office fairly popular and, as the first Latino mayor, that endorsement would be huge.”
The group also acknowledged the importance of reformed fiscal measures, education and public safety in their discussion. Sam Garrison, vice president of civic initiatives for Caruso Affiliated, a Los Angeles real estate developer,  said that whoever becomes the city’s next leader will face a $220 million budget deficit.
“Both Garcetti and Greuel have managed to avoid answering a lot of the questions on that issue so far,” Garrison said. “The next 11 weeks should get interesting.”
Panelists also discussed the low voter turnout on Tuesday. Barely 16 percent of registered voters showed up to the polls, a reality that some attributed to “voter fatigue” following the 2012 presidential election.
“With such low turnout numbers, the defining characteristic of the rest of this campaign will be which candidate is better able to identify his or her base and get them to show up on election day,” said Andrew Murcia, a USC College Republicans member.
Laura Coholan, a junior majoring in political science, responded positively toward the expertise on the panel.
“It was helpful to hear from the panelists because now, as I hear about who gets what endorsements, I’ll have a better sense of how the race is going to turn out,” Coholan said. “Hopefully, the runoff election will feature a greater turnout … even 20 percent would be nice.”

Millennials would rather give up their cars than their technology, according to the survey.
Those aged 18 to 34 would rather lose their car than either their computer or their smartphone. All other age groups surveyed, including people 35 to 44, 45 to 54-year-olds and people more than 55 years of age ranked a car as their most needed piece of technology, millennials ranked it as their third priority. The survey polled more than 1,000 participants.
Senior Fellow in the Annenberg Schools’ Center on Communication Leadership and Policy Morley, Winograd said millennials’ attachment to technology shows where they place the most value.
Tired of tires · A study conducted by Zipcar found that millennials prefer their smartphones and their computers to their cars. The number of students requesting parking permits decreased on campus last year. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“It’s a reflection of the value that staying connected brings to millennials,” said Winograd. “The car is a transportation device, it gets you from point A to point B, it’s a solution to a physical distance problem, but a smartphone is a solution how to stay in touch with anyone … anywhere in the world,”
Millennials surveyed were also more concerned with their effect on the environment than other age groups were. They considered being eco-friendly as a factor in their decisions to drive less.
The survey found that millennials are more likely to purchase goods online. USC Marshall School of Business Assistant Professor of Clinical Marketing Lars Perner said factors other than driving contribute to this.
“Part of it is that millennials have grown up with access to the Internet and feel comfortable buying that way,” Perner said.
Perner expects this trend to continue but believes online sales will never completely replace retail store sales.
USC Transportation Associate Director of Operations David Donovan said requests for parking permits on campus have dropped recently, but he does not completely relate it to the trend suggested by the survey.
“There has been a general decline [in parking permits requests], but we haven’t attributed it necessarily to millennials preferring cell phones,” Donovan said.
Brooke Seegan, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering, said she thinks the survey seemed to reflect the majority view of millennials, even though she keeps her car on campus.
“My phone and computer are definitely more essential to me than my car,” Seegan said. “My car is more for convenience. It makes it easier to go to places like the beach, but I could take the bus there if I didn’t have my car.”
Steve Kearns, a freshman majoring in public relations, however, feels differently.
“Living in Los Angeles, transportation is key, and I could not accomplish everything that I do in a day without the luxury of a car,” Kearns said.
Though millennials might be split on the issue, Winograd said the trend  in the survey will pronounced in future generations.
“Mobility is the technology that will drive all other technologies in the future,” Winograd said. “So, now we have not only the millennial generation — but also the next generation — the so called pluralist generation, who are focused on the ability to have the Internet with them at all times.”
A person who is 32, 33, or 34 today is a Gen Xer (not a Millennial).
Here are the dates for the generations from Strauss and Howe who coined the term “Millennials”:
Gen Xers, 1961 – 1981
Millennials, 1982 – 2004
Baby Boomers, 1943 – 1960
The Silents, 1925 – 1942

The Good Neighbors Campaign, exceeding its fundraising goal for the 20th year in a row, raised more than $1.6 million for local communities this year, USC announced Wednesday.
The campaign, which aims to raise money to support residents living near both the University Park Campus and the Health Sciences Campus, has raised $16 million since former USC President Steven Sample established the program in 1994.
The Good Neighbors Campaign was created on the premise that the university has a responsibility to give back to its city and the extended Trojan family.
The annual campaign kicks off every October and accepts donations throughout the year.  When staff members are hired by USC, a letter invites them to pledge a portion of their paychecks to the campaign.
The campaign requested donations from university faculty, staff and alumni.  This year, 5,565 university employees donated.
All proceeds from the campaign are donated to non-profit organizations.  Contributors choose to give their money to either the United Way or the University Neighborhood Outreach, which awards grants to programs in Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles.
Many grants made by United Neighborhood Outreach benefit families in the neighborhood by helping fund through art, education, health and legal programs.
Last year, the Good Neighbors Campaign helped fund programs, such as Troy Camp, the Thornton School of Jazz Reach, ASCS Junior Robotics Education and the Institute for Nonviolence in Los Angeles and Troy Camp.

Chinese ambassadors discussed the current state of foreign policy and China’s relationship with other parts of the world on Wednesday at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Close ties · Former Chinese Ambassador to Canada and Turkey Mei Ping describes the evolving relationship between China and the U.S. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The USC U.S.-China Institute hosted three prominent diplomats from China: former ambassador to Nigeria and Sweden Lu Fengding, former ambassador to Turkey and Canada Mei Ping and Zhou Gang, who served as the ambassador to Malaysia, Pakistan, Indonesia and India.
The ambassadors discussed the betterment of the major bilateral relationship between the United States and China.
The connection is particularly monetary in terms of scale: together, both the United States and China occupy one-third of the world’s economy and one-fifth of the world’s international trade.
“There is a need to explore ways that yield a new type of a major power relationship with the United States,” Mei said. “The old relationship was full of rivalry, which has led to world wars and one cold war. China wants to break this old type of relationship in order to construct a new relationship featured by mutual cooperation.”
The primary goal of the three former Chinese ambassadors’ trip was to continue China’s public diplomacy. The ambassadors said they wanted to strengthen mutual understanding between Americans and Chinese.
The ambassadors said they wanted to improve relations between the two countries by focusing on economic, environmental and political issues because the world is a more interdependent place.
“We are here to exchange ideas and questions, especially the question about the means and ways to further improve our relationship,” Lu said. “The two sides are very interested in trying to look at what kind of relationship we should manage, and how to further proceed it in a better, open-minded and objective way.”
Students who attended the discussion were interested in hearing about environmental , economical and political  issues from the ambassadors’ perspectives.
“All of these are very familiar issues, and it was interesting to see it from the Chinese perspective,” said Anja Kong, a freshman majoring in international relations (global business).
Charlene Tran, a sophomore majoring in business administration and international relations (global business) found the discussion to be a learning experience.
“Hearing from [the ambassadors] has actually opened my ears as to how I should look at issues differently,” Tran said. “It’s quite interesting to see and understand the Chinese perspective about their relationship with us.”
The ambassadors placed an especially strong emphasis on the importance of exchange students, especially between the United States and China.
USC enrolls more international students than any university in the country, and the ambassadors believe the growing number of USC students from China only enhances the learning environment.
“We think the exchange of students is very important for the future of our students,” Lu said. “Our future relations have a very good foundation to live from.”
The bonds developed among students from all parts of the world will have an impact that lasts past college, Zhou said.
“We hope this kind of dialogue of public diplomacy will help strengthen mutual respect and understanding among Chinese and American people, especially under the younger generation,” Zhou said.

USC senior Alex Lendrum was named the Pac-12 men’s swimming and diving scholar-athlete of the year at the Pac-12 men’s swimming and diving championships in Federal Way, Wash. on Wednesday. This honor was bestowed just one day after Lendrum took home the conference title in the 200-yard free.
Lendrum is a biochemistry major and has accrued a 3.76 cumulative GPA during his college career. The Phoenix native has also qualified for the Dean’s List every semester he has attended USC.
Last year, he was named to the Capital One Academic All-America second team and the All-District-8 first team. He is a two-time member of the Pac-12 All-Academic first team, having been selected each of the past two seasons, and was also a 2012 Spring CSCAA Scholar All-American.
Lendrum is a member of the Alpha Epsilon Delta Pre-Med honorary fraternity in addition to the Golden Key International honor society. He was the recipient of the USC David X. Marks Foundation  Scholar-Athlete Award in 2011 and 2012.
His successes that are not tied to his work in the classroom are equally impressive. In 2012, he was a first team All-American, and the year before he was an honorable mention All-American selection. This season, he was named team captain for the second time and last season he took sixth place in the 200-yard back at the 2012 NCAA championships.
In 2011, Lendrum took 13th place in the 200-yard back at the NCAA championships, his first individual points at the event. He also took 26th in the 100-yard back and 39th in the 200-yard individual medley.
To be eligible for the Pac-12 scholar-athlete of the year award, student-athletes must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher, maintain a senior standing athletic eligibility, compete in at least 50 percent of the scheduled contests in the sport and have at least one year of residence at the institution.
Each Pac-12 school can nominate one individual per sport, with the winner chosen by conference staff member at each sport’s season’s end.
In adding yet another honor to his trophy case, Lendrum has built up a considerable amount of momentum for himself, as well as the rest of the team, in preparation for the 2013 NCAA championships. The event is scheduled to begin on March 28 and run through March 30 in Indianapolis. USC has not won a national championship since 1977, when it won its fourth consecutive NCAA crown.

Call it a midseason slump or a blip on the radar, but the back-to-back losses suffered by the USC men’s tennis team were unequivocally one thing: shocking. The four-straight champions are not used to being tripped up twice, but after dropping matches to Virginia and UCLA, the team let its hair down this past weekend at the Pacific Coast Doubles Championships in San Diego. And, after a relaxing break, it’s back to business as usual.
To the point · Junior Ray Sarmiento, ranked No. 14 in the ITA singles rankings, was unfazed by the Trojans’ dip in the latest NCAA team rankings. Sarmiento has posted an overall record of 16-5 in singles this year. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
At the midway mark of the season, it would seem that USC is right on track to make yet another national championship run. Next on the schedule for the Trojans (13-2) is the spirited No. 12 Pepperdine Waves (10-2), a team known for its boundless energy, something that USC head coach Peter Smith stressed to his players.
“If you talk about energy, wait until you see Pepperdine play,” Smith said. “They bring more energy to the courts than by far any team in the country. They will bring it like you’ve never seen. It’s complete chaos in doubles.”
The frenzied Waves will pose a formidable threat to the Trojans in doubles play. After playing well in doubles to open up the season, USC dropped the doubles point in three straight matches last month, two of which they went on to lose. The Trojans got back on track by winning the doubles point and the match against the University of San Diego Toreros last week and by working on their game in the Pacific Coast Doubles Championships last weekend.
In that tournament, the newly formed duo of freshman Max de Vroome and sophomore Eric Johnson advanced to the finals but ultimately fell to UCLA sophomores Dennis Novikov and Marcos Giron. The Pepperdine pair of junior Francis Alcantara and senior Finn Tearney, ranked No. 27 in the nation, lost an early match in the Pacific Coast Doubles Championships, but went on a six-game win streak to take home the consolation title.
The Trojans, who also tried out a new doubles pair of sophomore Roberto Quiroz and junior Emilio Gomez this past weekend, believe they came out of the tournament stronger in that facet and hope to get ahead early against the Waves by securing the doubles point.
“Coming out from the first ball will be very important,” junior captain Michael Grant said. “Right out of the gate, right out of the starting blocks.”
In addition to their highly ranked doubles team, the Waves boast four nationally ranked players in singles: No. 7 senior Sebastian Fanselow, No. 73 junior Alex Sarkissian, No. 83 Tearney and No. 87 Alcantara.
Although Pepperdine’s Tearney and Alcantara, at No. 27, are ranked higher than USC’s premier doubles team of sophomore Yannick Hanfmann and junior Ray Sarmiento, at No. 31, and No. 7 Fanselow is ranked above No. 14 Sarmiento in singles, Sarmiento is not worried about the matchup. He isn’t worried either about the fact that the Trojans dropped one spot, from No. 2 to No. 3, in the latest national poll.    The Trojans are now behind Virginia and UCLA, the two teams they have lost to this season.
“It’s just a number,” Sarmiento said of the rankings. “The only number that matters is the ranking after the NCAAs.”
Instead of stressing over dropping a spot in the national rankings, the Trojans are focusing their attention on how to respond to the rambunctious energy Pepperdine will undoubtedly bring to the match on Friday.
“We’ve all played them before so we know that they bring a lot of energy,” Johnson said. “So, we’ll just have to bring our own, stay focused on ours and not get distracted by them.”
The match against the Waves kicks off at 3 p.m. tomorrow at Marks Stadium.

When news broke of USC Athletic Director Pat Haden’s three-hour meeting with former USC men’s basketball head coach Tim Floyd, my reaction was similar to that of fellow editor Alex Shultz’s, at least at first. I was a bit surprised, to say the least.
But once that initial shock subsided, my next thought was simple:  Why not?
After mulling the prospect of Floyd returning to the Galen Center sidelines, I must say that I would be on board should Haden decide to pull the trigger on hiring him.
As Shultz explained in his column yesterday, there are many reservations about Floyd coming back to USC given the events that led to his resignation. Considering how I instinctively responded to the news with hesitation, I completely understand where he’s coming from.
But recall what Haden said during USC’s first game after former head coach Kevin O’Neill was fired: He pledged to turn USC’s basketball program into a winner. He said that, given the resources, location and national branding of USC, there was no reason that the Trojans could not consistently contend for conference and, down the line, national championships in men’s basketball.
And he’s right.
Really, there is no good reason why USC’s basketball program shouldn’t be strong. The private school’s deep pockets and nationwide name recognition surely bolster its case, but the main factor that will be crucial in making the program great is simple: location, location, location.
USC is in the heart of arguably the deepest and richest pool of high school basketball talent in the country, which is why it is paramount to first and foremost hire a head coach who can recruit, something that Floyd has excelled in doing.
Consider that, during his four-year run as head coach, he recruited future NBA first-round picks Taj Gibson, O.J. Mayo, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic, not to mention other all-conference players such as Daniel Hackett and Davon Jefferson.
Yes, the inclusion of Mayo in that list remains a source of discomfort. True, in its investigation, the NCAA found no violations made by Floyd, but the thought of welcoming back someone associated with perhaps the some of darkest times for the USC athletic program might be difficult to come to grips with.
But to be honest, once I thought about it a little, I was able to come to grips with this idea pretty quickly.
In the years that have passed since the NCAA’s USC witch hunt concluded, the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions has about as much credibility with the public as Manti Te’o — exactly none. It’s widely viewed that the punishment handed down by the COI to USC’s football program was borderline criminal, and the sanctions placed on the basketball program were actually self-imposed, despite the COI finding no misconduct committed by Floyd himself.
What further increases my level of comfort with a possible Floyd return is the man who will be making the decision: Haden. This is a man who has dotted his I’s and crossed his T’s so diligently since arriving at USC that I think we can all safely trust his judgment.
Remember, this is the same person who ruled former running back Dillon Baxter ineligible for receiving a five-minute golf cart ride across campus by a wannabe sports agent in November 2010, as well as the man who suspended and later fired former baseball coach Frank Cruz because he violated the NCAA’s limits on CARA hours.
If Haden has decided to consider Floyd, you’d better believe he’s done plenty of investigating of his own to see if Floyd truly committed any wrongdoing at USC. Haden’s played things too safe since replacing former AD Mike Garrett to take a chance on someone who might be a liability, which makes me believe that hiring Floyd would not put the program at risk for any future infractions.
But the main reason to believe Floyd can fulfill Haden’s vision and turn USC basketball into a winner is that he’s done it before. In his four years with the school, the Trojans posted a record of 85-50 (counting games that have since been vacated by the NCAA), including a 25-12 record during the 2006-07 season — the most wins in school history. That year, Floyd led the team to the Sweet 16, accomplishing something only one other USC team had done since 1979, but lost in heartbreaking fashion to top-ranked North Carolina.
Floyd would go on to lead the team to three consecutive NCAA tournaments from 2007-09, the only time that has happened in school history. In 2009, USC won its first and only conference tournament when it beat Arizona State during a championship game at Staples Center. In the 2009 NCAA tournament, the Trojans pushed eventual national runner-up Michigan State to the brink in the second round of the tournament, but fell just short in what would be Floyd’s last game as head coach.
If those last two paragraphs seem long-winded, it’s because they were. But that’s what happens when you chronicle the achievements of a successful basketball program, which is exactly what Floyd built during his       all-too-brief run with the Trojans.
Just imagine what he could do in his second time around.

Very well-written. Regardless, I think USC basketball has a bright future.
Excellent arguments, Nick, but as a UTEP Miners fan I’m hoping Haden won’t make the offer to Floyd.  UTEP is on the very brink of returning to and surpassing its glory years.  I’d be so bold as to say that with the recruiting class Floyd has coming in next year the Miners can actually make a decent run in the NCAA tournament.  I do believe, however, that Floyd will take the USC job if offered, which will deal a serious blow the UTEP basketball program.

For much of 2013, the USC women’s basketball team has been mired in an ugly losing streak and, collectively, the team has looked toward the Pac-12 tournament as relief to end a disappointing regular season.
Crunch time · USC sophomore guard Ariya Crook has averaged 11.5 points per game in the team’s two victories this past weekend. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Fresh off of a weekend sweep of the Arizona schools in the final series of the regular season, however, the Women of Troy      (10-19, 7-11 Pac-12) will attempt to continue their newfound momentum as they travel to Seattle, Wash., where they hope to achieve the improbable and secure an NCAA tournament berth with four straight wins.
“This is one and done,” USC head coach Michael Cooper said. “You have to do everything to perfection or the best that you can. You hope your defense will help your offense, but if your offense is executing on the right notes you can win some basketball games.”
USC snapped an eight-game losing streak last weekend by winning both their games in Arizona, beating Arizona (12-17, 4-13 Pac-12) 74-62 on Friday, then beating Arizona State (13-17, 5-13 Pac-12) 67-60 on Sunday.
Junior forward Cassie Harberts, who was selected for the 2012 All-Pac-12 team this week, tallied double-doubles in both games, finishing with 23 points and 11 rebounds against Arizona and 12 points and 10 rebounds against ASU.
Senior forward Christina Marinacci also earned a double-double against the Wildcats, finishing with 16 points and a career-high 18 rebounds. She scored 13 points and grabbed six rebounds against the Sun Devils.
“We’re the underdog in this situation. A lot of teams have already beaten us, and they’re not expecting us to go out and perform well,” junior forward Desiree Bradley said. “We have to come out with confidence, even though we’ve been through a difficult season, and just know we’re a great team no matter what our record says and come out and compete.”
The two victories over the weekend came after an 0-8 February, with five losses by single digits and four by five or fewer points. The wins enabled USC to earn the No. 7 seed, pitting them against No. 10 seed Oregon State (10-20, 4-14 Pac-12) in today’s opening round game at noon. In the two teams’ only matchup of the year, the Women of Troy knocked off the Beavers 56-55 in Corvallis, Ore. If USC wins, it will then face No. 2 seed California (27-2, 17-1 Pac-12) on Friday, March 8 at noon. The Women of Troy lost both games against Cal during the regular season, losing 71-63 in overtime at Berkeley on Jan. 17 and 72-64 at the Galen Center on Feb. 17.
“The good thing about this is we already saw Oregon State, so we kind of know how they are,” Cooper said. “We’ve been watching a lot of film of them in their last games against Colorado and Utah. We just have to execute what we’re going to do with their pick-and-rolls.”
Last season, the Women of Troy rode a six-game winning streak into the Pac-12 tournament, earning a bye in the quarterfinal as the No. 3 seed. They would then face No. 11 seed Washington State, which had just upset No. 6 seed Oregon State in the first round. The Cougars were ready for USC too, hitting over 50 percent of their 3-pointers en route to a 69-55 win. The Women of Troy, despite the 11th toughest schedule, an RPI of 30 and an 18-12 record, missed the NCAA tournament, which they last made in 2006.
After striking out in the month of February, USC will hope to parlay its perfect start to March into a magical run and end their six-year NCAA tournament drought.

Losing is never pretty, but USC’s loss Wednesday night was downright ugly.
Despite late-inning efforts, the Trojans were unable to dig themselves out of a double-digit hole and were ultimately thrashed in an 11-4 blowout at Dedeaux Field.
Down and out · Junior infielder James Roberts went 0-for-2 and with an error in Wednesday’s loss to Cal State Fullerton. The Titans put the game out of reach early, handing the Trojans their third consecutive loss. — Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
“This is the most physical Fullerton team I’ve ever seen and I played against them in the early ’90s,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said. “They have big power, they’re really physical and they’re really athletic throughout the lineup.”
The Trojan bullpen was bruised badly against offensive goliath Cal State Fullerton (11-2), which ended a brief two-game losing streak in its victory over USC (6-6).
Heading into the game, the No. 13 Titans promised to be a challenge, flaunting a .384 team batting average (nearly .100 higher than USC) while holding opponents to .246. Fullerton, however, had lost two consecutive games entering Wednesday, with the most recent loss against San Diego on Tuesday.
The Titans took the field at Dedeaux in their second game in as many days but hardly showed any signs of wear as they pounced early on freshman starting pitcher Brent Wheatley. The first batter of the night reached base on an error and the Titans flexed their offensive muscles on the very next pitch with an RBI-double. An early visit to the mound from Hubbs couldn’t settle Wheatley, who went on to serve up consecutive singles that enabled the Titans to plate their second and third runs of the inning.
“We can’t have an error the first play of the game with a freshman on the mound and not think it’s going to affect us at all,” Hubbs said.
The Fullerton bats were right back at it the following inning and were downright merciless. After a leadoff single, the Titans pieced together a pair of hits, including another RBI double that sent their fourth run across home plate.
Wheatley was yanked after only 1.1 innings’ work, in which he faced 13 batters and surrendered six runs (5 earned) on seven hits and a walk. USC barely had a chance to hold its breath before junior lefty Sean Silva came in for relief and was promptly greeted by a relentless Titan offense that extended its lead to eight.
“If we pitch well and play good defense, we’ll be in most games,” Hubbs said. “We didn’t pitch well early but I thought we pitched pretty well late. We didn’t play good defense early but I thought we played better late.”
USC’s offense was slow to ignite but finally showed signs of life in the sixth inning, offering a vocal crowd a glimmer of hope. Freshman outfielder Timmy Robinson sparked a rally with a single, and redshirt senior outfielder Greg Zebrack ended the offensive drought with an RBI triple, later scoring on a ground ball.
In the following inning, USC finally got the “big hit” that Hubbs had been waiting for when freshman Bobby Stahel laced a bases-loaded single down the right field line to score two. The team was unable to add any more runs to the board, ending the game with a fruitless final attempt in the bottom of the ninth.
“We’re just not getting the hit at the right moment. It’s tough,” said junior third baseman Kevin Swick. “It’s frustrating as a group, but I think we’ll pull together eventually.”
On Monday, Hubbs said his team needed to be strong out of the bullpen and get big hits in order to win games. In Wednesday’s loss, USC was unable to accomplish either. The Trojans had 10 hits on the night and drew four walks, but an inability to plate runs continued to be the team’s Achilles’ heel.
The Trojans will battle more ranked teams this weekend, hosting No. 14 Oklahoma on Friday, No. 26 Notre Dame on Saturday, and finishing the series at No. 7 UCLA on Sunday.
Same old song and dance with excuses galore. Second game in a  row where it was over before it
started. Young staff now finding out this is not high school when meeting top teams. Musical chairs
with coaches has to stop, and a real hire is needed to get the program back to being highly competitive.

College is a time to try new things, whether it’s taking a class outside your major, playing Quidditch or wearing bro-tanks every day. For a lot of college students, a switch to a different diet can happen in the middle of a semester; many students, after all, have begun eating stuff beyond what Dad or Mom put on the table.
For some, this might lead to the “freshman 15” but, for others, it can be a way to explore a new dietary regimen that doesn’t consist solely of pizza and Chano’s. Vegetarian or vegan diets, especially, are a perfect way to reset your eating habits.
Along with the health benefits (low cholesterol, more fiber, fewer calories), vegetarian or vegan diets are one of the most surefire ways to support the environment as factory farming (the way a majority of meat is produced) produces significantly more greenhouse gases than large-scale produce farms. The trend has been slowly gaining traction: As of 2012, 4 percent of Americans eat a vegan or vegetarian diet, according to a Harris Interactive Poll, up from about 1 percent 40 years ago.
Of course, any change can be a little scary. If you’re considering cutting out meat, dairy and eggs from your diet, fear not. While navigating USC’s dining halls as a person with dietary restrictions is a matter in itself, eating out can present unique challenges for vegans and vegetarians. These unique challenges have simple solutions but vary from cuisine to cuisine.
American 
Stereotypical American food does not bode well for vegans. Places that mainly serve hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken fingers and milkshakes rarely seem to have many vegetarian, much less vegan, options. Of course, there are some surprising finds among fast-food franchises beyond fries: Fatburger and Burger King both sell veggie burgers and McDonald’s apple pies are vegan.
Diner-type restaurants, on the other hand, can frequently be unfriendly to vegan or vegetarian diets. If the place is not a franchise, your best bet is often to ask for soup (be sure to ask the server if meat broth is used), scour the menu for some sort of meat-substitute burger or just ask for a simple sandwich consisting of grilled veggies and available garnishes.
Latin 
Many of the cuisines of Latin America put an emphasis on meat, but there are almost always delicious vegan options. As long as refried beans don’t include lard and black beans aren’t cooked with pork products, you’ll have a solid selection at most Mexican restaurants. Many places have a veggie burrito (don’t forget to ask if the guacamole has dairy in it — it’s more common than you think — and specify no sour cream or cheese) or some sort of grilled veg plate. There are quite a few restaurants around L.A. that even offer vegan tamales (such as Teresa’s Mosaic Café in El Segundo). Of course, Angelenos have access to a wide variety of food that hails from South America, and many vegetable-based “side dishes” can serve as a main element of your meal.
Asian 
In Los Angeles, most restaurants seem to be Japanese, Korean, generic Chinese (though there are many places that specify province) or Thai. There are, of course, others, which often offer amazing vegetarian and vegan food, particularly those with some sort of Buddhist affiliation.
The best part about Asian food is the use of tofu. Japanese and Korean restaurants in the U.S. tend to be a bit more authentic and avoid frying the crap out of it, as many Chinese restaurants do. Japanese restaurants often have a few fish-less items (even on sushi menus) and tend to value very fresh, crisp veggies. Tempura, for example, is a fantastic comfort food (though it sometimes has egg). Korean restaurants in L.A. (especially the divier spots in Koreatown) can be a bit tricky because many will put a small amount of meat in a seemingly veggie-friendly entree. Depending on the place, you might need a translator to figure out what you can order. Chinese restaurants usually have some sort of tofu dish that is good, but again, depending on how much of a dive the place is, make sure your communication with your server is clear.
European 
Even though Europe is geographically smaller than Asia, European food has had a greater influence on “American” cuisine, and there’s a large number of Italian and French restaurants around the city, with a few German and even Russian places around. Italian food is actually pretty easy: Most Italian wedding soup is vegan, as is most pasta and pizza without cheese. My favorite Italian place, Eatalian Cafe, in Gardena, even has a marinara pizza that is just dough, sauce and garlic. Sorbet and sorbetto are also vegan and are always a clutch dessert.
French food, to be quite honest, often sucks for vegetarians, and is much worse for vegans. Again, soup is your friend, though watch out for French onion soup, which traditionally is made with beef broth. Sometimes ratatouille is made without butter, and, oftentimes, the clientele of nicer restaurants around the city mean some sort of vegan option is available. There aren’t a whole lot of hole-in-the-wall French places, so servers tend to be more receptive to dietary needs. German food is similar in this regard — heavy on the meat — but sausage places often have at least one vegan option. Wurstküche in Downtown has a particularly succulent Italian vegetarian sausage.
Middle Eastern 
Food with routes in the area roughly between Greece, Iran and Egypt can be a mixed bag. Some places are heavy on shawarma or gyros, which are obviously not an option. Falafel is rarely not vegetarian and is oftentimes vegan (ask about egg), but its quality can vary widely. Hummus is always delicious, though pita sometimes contains yogurt. For food from Mediterranean areas (Greece, Turkey, Israel, Lebanon), falafel, hummus, tahini and lentils will probably yield your best bet. Cuisine that hails from inland or more southerly areas (Persian and Egyptian food especially), you can usually get some pretty awesomely spiced vegetables. Shamshiri in Westwood has delectable vegetable stew with saffron rice.
A vegetarian or vegan diet does not need to be salad and tofu 24/7 (unless you’re into that). As a vegetarian of four years with some pretty severe lactose intolerance, I rarely just munch on lettuce and carrots. This sort of diet is not for everyone but, increasingly, more and more Americans are hopping on the vegan train. Los Angeles has a plethora of great exclusively vegan restaurants, and a dietary restriction does not need to restrict your culinary adventures by any means — it often expands it. At the end of the day, the worst thing that can happen is that you skip a meal. So, go out, explore and happy eating.
Great article! It is really fascinating to see the vegetarian and vegan population has quadrupled. I’ve noticed so much more media about veganism in the last 2 years, I have a feeling we are reaching a critical point that the meat industry fears. This is impacting the mainstream, and we know with all the health problems, we need to be eating way more vegetables anyways.
To Darlene, I salute you. I’d encourage you to try new vegetables you haven’t tried before to see what you like. You can bake a spaghetti squash and use it instead of pasta. Or you can peal zucchini into ‘pasta’ strips and add your spaghetti sauce to that. I tried eating okra raw, and discovered I like it! I just eat it like a popsicle, and the kids might like that. I’m not a raw foodist by any means, but I’ve discovered I like brussels sprouts raw (as well as cooked), and my neighbors kids liked it. Kids like things small like that. Oh, they tried raw fennel too, which cut small can look like little trees. It’s a stronger flavor, but not as sharp as raw onion. I find I love steamed mushrooms and some kinds of kale (flat leaf) vs others (curly leaf). I like collards, wrapped around hummus, and I also discovered kholrabi, which is like a round broccoli stalk. It is nice eaten raw or it can be cooked.
World’s easiest soup: take a few cups of frozen veggies (at least two varieties), add a few cups of water and bouillion cubes and throw it all in the slow cooker. On high, it cooks in about 3 hours. If you want to add soup mix beans, go for it, but it will take a little longer, but you get extra iron and protein. I recommend using no-sodium broth as sodium can keep the beans from softening, then add salt at the end. It is the easiest, laziest meal and you can change it each time by using a different combination of frozen veggies. I like to include onions, but it takes more work, unless you slice or chop your onions ahead of time and keep them in the freezer. I might also throw in a bit of fresh garlic.
I want to introduce my kids to eating more veggies. But as they say, parents should lead as example so I have to learn how to eat more veggies so I can convince my kids that veggies are good for the body.
BK’s veggie patty contains egg, so its vegetarian, not vegan.  
If you want to try new restaurants where you don’t have to worry about whether there will be food available, search happycow.net
You forgot about Indian food. It’s probably the one native cuisine that is primarily vegetarian.

Last week, I wrote about teen fantasy’s tendency to transform folkloric monsters into male love interests — usually to offer female protagonists a taste of immortality. Twilight, Wicked Lovely and even Aimee Carter’s The Goddess Test series hybridize their romantic heroes with more villainous qualities, making their characters appealing because of their dual natures.
But it would be remiss to ignore the prevalence of naughty heroines in fictional works. If teen fantasy employs a “bad guy” formula to seduce young readers, then larger branches of literature explore the multifaceted nature of what it means for female characters to be “bad.” Brooding facades and dark superpowers might be characteristic of a few, but others take on much more varied approaches, rendering the “bad girl” type completely multidimensional within the pages of a novel.
In the clearest sense of the term “bad girl,” there is the depiction of female characters who are inherently evil. Lady Macbeth of William Shakespeare’s Macbeth, for example, holds a title as one of the darkest characters in literature. As she persuades her husband to kill King Duncan for his crown, she reveals herself as the driving force behind Macbeth’s cruel actions. Further instilling fear in audiences because of her complete dismissal of femininity and her delayed remorse for her actions, Lady Macbeth holds rank among the likes of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz’s Wicked Witch of the West and The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe’s White Witch. Still, this darker female character continues to hold wide appeal, as the theatrical role of Lady Macbeth has attracted the likes of Vivien Leigh and dame Judi Dench.
But after this point, the definition of “bad” becomes a bit more ambiguous. Because female independence is so often a point of argument, female characters who display even the slightest bit of sexual promiscuity or lack of restraint could fall under this category.
Such issues translate into one of the more recent takes on the “bad girl:” “the b-tch.” Today, not-so-innocent female characters are better known for their flair for the dramatic or lack of morality rather than for demonic, Lady Macbeth-esque characteristics.
Both Cecily von Ziegesar’s Gossip Girl and Sara Shepard’s Pretty Little Liars series, for example, have earned cult followings as well as television show spinoffs, demonstrating a wide audience attraction for female rule-breakers. The protagonists of these novels dismiss the “evil” characteristics of Lady Macbeth, and instead embrace those of the modern b-tch. As they confront the moral wrongs of lying, illegal activities and hedonism, these characters remain completely self-absorbed and narcissistic, attracting us as we keep watching to see what they’ll do next.
“Blair liked to think of herself as a hopeless romantic in the style of old movie actresses like Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe,” says Ziegesar’s narrator in Gossip Girl. “She was always coming up with plot devices for the movie she was starring in at the moment, the movie that was her life.”
Still, what’s most interesting about Ziegesar’s and Shepard’s takes on the “bad girl” is the attitude that readers are supposed to have toward the characters: We like them, even as we watch them tear each other apart.
This marks an abrupt departure from other depictions of “bad girls,” ones where authors attempt to convince us of their characters’ innocence. Take Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, for instance. When Hester Prynne engages in extramarital sex and has a child out of wedlock, she is ostracized from her society and forced to wear a red “A” (for adulteress) on her chest.
But though the puritanical citizens of Baltimore despise Hester, the reader certainly doesn’t. Hawthorne makes sure to illustrate Hester’s oppression and genuine repentance, convincing us early on that she’s not really a “bad girl,” despite what the larger society might think of her.
Today, however, naughty female characters don’t need to make us believe that they’ve repented.
Gossip Girl’s Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen appeal to us even with their unapologetic behaviors. Sure, some of their allure might be attributed to the glamour of their overprivileged lives and the resilience of their friendship, but a large part of our interest lies in watching the characters come up with complicated ruses to handle petty problems.
But why are we so fascinated with this particular take on the “bad girl?” Perhaps Toni Morrison’s Sula best sums up their allure. Following the friendship of the conservative Nel and the wildly independent Sula, Morrison’s novel explores the attraction between good and bad, between chastity and promiscuity. When Sula sleeps with Nel’s husband, Jude, the friendship between the two heroines ends, though Nel later comes to regret Sula’s absence.
“She had been looking all along for a friend, and it took her a while to discover that a lover was not a comrade and could never be — for a woman,” says Morrison’s narrator. “And that no one would ever be that version of herself which she sought to reach out to and touch with an ungloved hand. There was only her own mood and whim, and if that was all there was, she decided to turn the naked hand toward it, discover it and let others become as intimate with their own selves as she was.”
What Morrison seems to suggest is that we look to “bad” characters as catharsis for our own darker emotions — particularly emotions toward those who’ve wronged us. Women sick of male chauvinism might rejoice when Lisbeth Salander brands her rapist with a vulgar tattoo in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Victims of adultery live vicariously through Waiting to Exhale’s Bernadine Harris when she sets her husband’s car on fire.
If “bad girls” teach us anything, it’s that humankind can be messy and, at times, downright ugly.
But even if we can’t be totally uninhibited ourselves, we can at least enjoy reading about those who can be.

A lot can happen in a year. For more than 200 directors, 2,000 artists and hundreds more speakers, gamers and comedians, the fruit of their efforts will be celebrated at the South by Southwest conferences and festivals, held in Austin, Texas, from March 8 to 17. The event highlights achievements and new talents in music, film and interactive media.
Though the enormous crowds (in 2012, an estimated 36,000 attendees and 100,000 “unofficial” attendees) that descend on Austin each March make it easy for just one performance or one showing to feel small, the individual events are all part of a larger, welcoming experience.
Creative direction · The South by Southwest festival prides itself on being a launching pad for new creative content. The 10-day festival in Austin, Texas, features independent films, music and intertactive media collaborations. Celebrating its 27th year on Friday, the festival will celebrate in its usual style, showcasing some of the hottest and most innovative content around. — Courtesy of SXSW 
One of SXSW’s most impressive event is its music conference. Held from March 12-17 in more than 100 different venues in downtown Austin, the conference will showcase a whopping 2,286 acts including Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Kendrick Lamar, Justin Timberlake, Third Eye Blind and Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
The interactive portion, which runs March 8-12, consists of a gaming exposition, entrepreneurial and technological events and comedy acts.
Across town, the SXSW film festival will screen feature and short films from March 8 – 16.
Many films, ranging in genre from narrative to documentary to music video, will be making their premieres at the festival. Headliners include Spring Breakers, starring James Franco, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson, and The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, led by Steve Carell, Steve Buscemi, Olivia Wilde, Alan Arkin and Jim Carrey.
For up-and-coming director Hannah Fidell, showing her film at SXSW will complete another leg of a promising journey.
Exactly one year ago, Fidell wrapped principal photography on her film A Teacher, which follows the rise and fall of an affair between a high school teacher and her student. Just over one month ago, A Teacher made its debut at Sundance Film Festival. And in approximately one week, Fidell’s film, picked as a “Festival Favorite,” will be screened across three different venues at SXSW.
But this is not the first time Fidell, who both directed and wrote A Teacher, will have her work displayed at SXSW. In 2012, the festival screened two of her short films, The Gathering Squall and Man & Gun.
Not that this changes the excitement of it all.
“Getting into Sundance and SXSW feels like I’ve won the lottery,” Fidell said.
But the talented writer and director, who was recently named one of Filmmaker Magazine’s “25 New Faces of Independent Film,” attributes the film’s success to the many people she collaborated with, not just herself.
“I was able to work with a lot of very talented people who put in much more than they were expected to or paid for,” Fidell noted, “and because of that, we ended up with a film that I think is very unique in its approach, both narratively and visually. Leading up to SXSW, I’m feeling cool as a cucumber.”
Though she studied film theory as an undergraduate, Fidell said she “never had the balls to actually make anything” until after graduation. It was during her first job as a fresh-out-of-college graduate, working the front desk of director and producer Ridley Scott’s commercial production company RSA Films, that she was given the push she needed to pursue her passion.
“I saw all these commercial directors in their 40s who were still working on that first feature script, and I realized that it was now or never,” Fidell said. “So I went out and made a film, made all the mistakes when it didn’t matter — when there wasn’t any pressure because I was self-financing.”
Now, with a post-production prize from the 2012 Champs-Élysées Film Festival for A Teacher under her belt, she is excited to relax and take in what the festival has to offer.
“There is very little pressure on us now,” Fidell said. “The film was bought after Sundance, and now I get to actually have fun. We shot the film in Austin, so it’s going to be a nice homecoming with a lot of cast and crew who weren’t able to make it out to Park City in January.”
After SXSW, Fidell hopes to begin shooting another film she wrote called That Girl on TV.
“It’s a critique, and satire, of reality television shows such as Keeping Up With The Kardashians,” Fidell said. “It was nice to write a comedy after spending so long on such a dark film like A Teacher.”
With three SXSW selections, a Sundance premiere and a new production in the works all in a year’s time, Fidell has her hands busy with many exciting projects.
This is not her first time presenting at SXSW and one suspects this will not be her last.  It is easy to believe her when, looking forward, she said, “the future looks bright.”

In response to “Lack of GOP support for civil rights shows insensitivity”
Recently, a Daily Trojan writer wrote a rather excoriating article which, while well-evidenced, incorrectly characterized the GOP’s vote on the Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA. As a proud member of the party, as secretary for the USC College Republicans and even as a concerned citizen, I felt that Nathaniel Haas’ column deserves a different point of view.
On its face, this argument presents a false dichotomy. It dilutes the issues at hand to a simple either-or. According to Haas, either the GOP is in favor of the act or is a coterie of misogynists. In no way, shape or form is this the case. In fact, the act’s original passage in 1994, which Haas mentions, was made possible with overwhelming Republican support. Those republicans who voted against the act in 2013 did so for other reasons, which I will explore further.
It is most important to note that the GOP is not “The Party of No,” as Haas suggests. No one is against civil rights. The recent vote on the renewal of VAWA, however, reveals a complex debate over the role of the government. Some republicans voted against the provisions of the act for the simple reason that the government ought not to decide who should or should not be considered within the LGBT community. This act is now open to a wide variety of abuses, particularly those who might be tempted to claim to be one sexual orientation or another in order to receive the benefits of the act. Unlike other descriptions, such as race, place of birth, educational status and so on, homosexuality is a less tangible category to define. How is the government to decide what that definition is? Fundamentally, what Haas did not show, and what the party must communicate, is the fact that the federal government cannot possibly interpret who is still in the closet and who is not.
Other civic services show that the federal government ought to be careful in how it defines homosexuality. For the same reasons, federal courts have ruled against the elimination of gay jurors from jury selection as being a violation of the 14th Amendment. The government has no business in determining someone’s sexual orientation, making enforcement of the new provisions of VAWA difficult. In light of this analysis, and the potential abuses which will take place, I can see why these republicans voted against the renewal of the act in that form.
Do not be mistaken: This is not to say that the Republican Party is against homosexual individuals, either. The GOP is in favor of limited government, not curtailing the rights of people. Nowhere in our constitution does it say that Congress ought to make definitions on what a citizen is, let alone who can marry. Marriage law has historically been a state issue. If a state decides that churches (or any other place, for that matter) can marry whoever they want, then so be it. It is a two-way street, however: The government must respect the rights of states to say no, since there is no constitutional authority.
Unfortunately, the party has not done a good job in communicating this message for the past two or more elections. I would say that, in the future, we must be more willing to voice the true ideals of limited government, rather than allow ourselves to be characterized as a religious party, so that hasty generalizations are not made.
If only the rest of the GOP would follow my lead.
Jack Merritt
Secretary, USC College Republicans
I’m so glad for once someone has the courage – and the patience – to deal with the one-sided, oversimplified bias from this section and this particular writer. Bravo.
“Some republicans voted against the provisions of the act for the simple reason that the government ought not to decide who should or should not be considered within the LGBT community. This act is now open to a wide variety of abuses, particularly those who might be tempted to claim to be one sexual orientation or another in order to receive the benefits of the act.”
Because heterosexual individuals are just dying to receive a lifetime of harassment and bullying for saying they’re gay (read: second class citizen) in exchange for the benefits provided by the Violence Against Women Act.
Right on with this article…Liberals are trying too hard to make every issue black and white. Glad someone stood up to their hidden political agenda and talked about the other factors at play with this issue.
Great article!

The American Atheists’ “Go Godless” billboards are simply smear campaigns with no purpose.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
The American Atheists, an organization that seeks to promote civil liberties for atheists, recently announced a billboard campaign in Texas denouncing high-ranking conservative politicians for their religious views, according to CNN. The campaign, which prints taglines such as “The Church Protected Priests Who Abused Children” and “Go Godless Instead,” contains inaccurate and misquoted information from politicians, such as former Gov. Sarah Palin.
Though American Atheist President David Silverman tells CNN that his goal is to “shame these leaders for their bigoted and backwards remarks and attitudes,” his campaign will have the opposite effect. By targeting specific individuals and by using out-of-context sound bites, his campaign is reduced to nothing more than an incredible smear campaign that seeks to antagonize an already polarized nation rather than unify it.
This isn’t the first time that the organization has led a controversial billboard campaign. During the 2010 Christmas season, the group put up spreads in New York City preaching: “You Know It’s A Myth. This Season, Celebrate Reason,” according to The Huffington Post. As an organization that seeks to promote the use of rationality, its approach is extremely hypocritical. By disseminating sweeping generalizations via short catchphrases on billboards, the organization is exploiting sensitive and complicated issues, such as the sexual assault of children by religious officials, all in order to promote its viewpoint.
Free speech guarantees Silverman the right to promote atheism through an insensitive billboard campaign. But as a nationally recognized organization that seeks to “stimulate and promote freedom of thought,” according to the American Atheists website, it is the organization’s responsibility to not fight fire with fire and resist bowing to childish “he said-she said” tactics that have been running rampant in recent political campaigns.
The launch of the campaign will unfortunately reflect and re-affirm the current “sound-bite era” — an era in which fact and fiction are intentionally blurred for the purpose of promoting a certain political party or cause. In such a partisan nation, it has boiled down to a vicious battle of words. We are all victims to our passions, biases and emotions, but only until we can achieve rational discourse will we be able to make social and political progress.

The American Atheists have a right to free speech and should be able to express their ideals in ways they see fit.
It is this same First Amendment that protects Christian groups such as the Southwest Baptist Church, which displays anti-gay billboards that read “Homosexuality is a sin but Christ can set you free.” It is the same First Amendment that also allows the American Freedom Defense Initiative to pay thousands of dollars for signs at Metro North stations proclaiming Islam causes terrorist attacks.
Consequently, although some of these messages are misleading and offensive in nature, questioning the legal existence of these billboards risks impeding upon the liberties provided to all Americans.
Arguably, the United States provides an unrestrictive forum where people of varying religious and cultural upbringings can freely voice their thoughts. Allowing some billboards, such as those of the Christian groups, to remain and disallowing the American Atheists’ billboards would be inherently discriminatory.
Each group has its own vendetta, and if they choose to duke it out before the American people, that is their right. In the end, it is up to the discretion of the public to absorb the information spread by these signs and make their own judgments.
Despite the presence of the First Amendment, the government has drawn a line in certain circumstances. For example, according to the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, a district court took down a billboard by a man criticizing his ex-girlfriend for allegedly having an abortion. Although this man believed he was exercising his First Amendment right, according to the courts he violated his ex-girlfriend’s right to privacy, thus invalidating his own right to put up the billboard in the first place.
Since the American Atheists’ billboard does not infringe upon the rights of others but acts as a tool to convey a particular political stance, it is as valid as attack ads are during political campaigns. Some might point out that the American Atheists misquoted Sarah Palin in their billboard, but these mistakes occur in general advertising practices as well. The misquotation was minor in nature and an apology was issued immediately for the error.
As long as other forms of political propaganda exist in a country that prides itself for its freedoms, these billboards do not cross the line. Instinctively, one may denounce the American Atheists for the intensity of its statements, but it is best to see the bigger picture and acknowledge the beauty of the U.S. Constitution at work.

To all those who are hating on “In God we trust” being on our currency since the ’50s, it’s been in the second stanza of our national anthem since the War of 1812. Atheists stfu
Our national anthem is melodically a british drinking song and was not our national anthem for several years after a (Christian) lawyer wrote it on a ship. It was only officialized by Woodrow Wilson a little over 100 years later. Google is a wonderful thing. Took me two seconds to reveal your fallacious reasoning.
There is room for all belief systems in the USA – even anti-belief systems. 
Atheists have one fundamental problem with their belief system, no recognized authority to codify their beliefs. 
Christians have Christ. Jews have Moses. Islam has Muhammad. 
Did “In God We Trust” replace, “redeemable in gold or silver” ?
Silverman and American Atheists have already apologized for the (slight) misquote of Sarah Palin, and have promised to replace it (they are looking at quotes from Rick Perry and George W. Bush; they won’t have any problems finding suitable candidates).  To my knowledge, none of the other quotes are actually inaccurate.
Of course, the church billboards still far outnumber atheist billboards, and I have yet to see a concerted effort to fact-check those.
I find offensive the religious billboards that always have been around.  Also, “In God We Trust” was only put on currency during the 50’s.  I see religion as the most divisive element in society.
“The campaign, which prints taglines such as “The Church Protected Priests Who Abused Children” and “Go Godless Instead,” contains inaccurate and misquoted information from politicians, such as former Gov. Sarah Palin.” 
I saw that they misquoted Palin, but who else was misquoted? You say “politicians”, so what else is inaccurately quoted? And do you think that the meaning was different? She basically said ‘the founding fathers would have done this and so should we.’
Santorum and Jeffress both said that they stood by their remarks. Out of context? Come on.
And statements like “What homosexuals do is filthy” unite the country? Why does it fall on American Atheists to unite the country in spite of what these people say?

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Monday, March 4, and Tuesday, March 5. 
Crimes against a person
at 2:25 p.m. on March 4, DPS officers responded to a student who sustained an injury to his foot when a vehicle drove over his skateboard while he was crossing the intersection of 32nd and Figueroa streets. The student declined the officers’ offer to request a Los Angeles Fire Department Rescue Ambulance unit to provide medical treatment and he was released to seek it on his own if necessary. The driver of the vehicle left the scene without stopping to check on the student’s welfare or to identify himself.
Crimes against property
at 7:45 p.m. on March 4, DPS officers conducted a search of Parking Structure A for a vehicle belonging to a faculty member who was recently transported to a hospital for medical treatment, but they were unable to locate it.
at 6:33 p.m. on March 4,  a staff member drove her vehicle into a chain link fence at Parking Structure A, damaging the passenger side view mirror.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 1:45 a.m. on March 5, DPS officers responded to a report of a possible suspect with a gun near 32nd Street and University Avenue. The officers were unable to locate the suspect but, after a subsequent check of surveillance camera footage and interviewing witnesses, they concluded that there was no gun and no crime had occurred.
at 1:25 A.m. on March 5, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect driving a vehicle that was identified as stolen by the license plate recognition system near 35th Place and Normandie Avenue. The officers located the vehicle and began following it, then LAPD officers responded to take over the pursuit. The suspect was detained for investigation and the LAPD officers arrested him after he was found in possession of cocaine. The officers thought that the vehicle did belong to the suspect, but the suspect had failed to report that the vehicle was recovered after previously reporting it stolen.
at 6:15 p.m. on March 4, DPS officers on routine patrol observed a suspect trespassing at 1047 23rd St. and detained him for investigation. A check of the suspect’s name revealed an outstanding warrant, and he was arrested and transported to 77th Station for booking.
at 5:20 p.m. on March 4, DPS officers responded to a student who sustained lacerations and abrasions to his face and hands and may have briefly lost consciousness when he fell while riding his bicycle near 37th St. and Catalina St. An LAFD unit was requested and Unit #15 responded. The RA Unit treated the student, then he was released to the officers and they transported him to Good Samaritan Hospital for additional medical treatment.
at 4:48 p.m. on March 4, DPS officers responded to a report of a vehicle fire at Superior Grocers, and upon their arrival, LAFD Unit #15 was at the scene. LAFD extinguished the fire without incident and there was no damage to any university property.

Many local food markets around South Los Angeles offer organically grown fruits and vegetables, but many students do not always take notice.

T.R.U.S.T. South LA, Community Services Unlimited and Ride South Los Angeles held a bike tour to promote awareness of these healthy food options on March 3.
More than 100 participants followed a map provided by the organizations to locate the markets.
François Bar, an associate professor in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, helped create the map by developing ParTour, a system that uses mobile technology to reach out to people in the surrounding community. People in the community use their cell phones to send text messages or pictures of places around Los Angeles to an email address and then provide descriptions that identify the place’s location. In the case of the health map, the people in the community sent information about healthy places to eat.
“Many of the residents in the area don’t have iPhones, so this is a way that everyone can be involved. It can be used for all feature phones; they just have to have a camera,” Bar said.
Bar said that so far 50 and 100 people are currently using the map.
This project was created to raise awareness of healthy food options in the area.
The restaurants and stores highlighted include Fresh and Easy, Mama’s Chicken, Superior Grocery Store, El Azteca and Ralphs Grocery Store.
Bar believes the map serves as an important tool for engaging in the community around South Los Angeles.
“The map is not mainly about finding the way around South Los Angeles, but more of a story about the neighborhood which is not usually told,” Bar said. “South L.A. has the reputation for being a food desert, but this is not true. People have been working to bring healthy food here.”
Bar said the map is also used as a way for people to find healthy ways to get to the food places, such as walking and bike riding. Another one of the main features of the map is an identification of the different community gardens in the neighborhood.
TRUST South LA and Community Services Unlimited organized the bike tour around the South Los Angeles area to demonstrate its features. Biking helps to demonstrate the different healthy ways for people to access the stores and markets and for people to get some exercise.
Some students who live in the area said they do not know about the healthy options that surround them.
“Healthy food is not advertised,” said Austin Mudd, a sophomore majoring in business administration.       “There are a lot of extremely unhealthy fast food places along Figueroa but, other than Fresh & Easy, not much else comes to mind.”
Not everyone, however, believes promoting local food markets will be completely successful. Students are concerned that with healthier food also comes more expensive prices, which might not end up helping the community.
“The problem with healthy food is that it tends to be more time-consuming to access and definitely costs more,”  said Ryan Heintz, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience.
This project will continue throughout the year and the map will be continuously updated, Bar said. Bar also encourages residents around the area to remain involved in the effort to raise awareness about healthy eating.

Newly elected Undergraduate Student Government President-elect Christian Kurth and Vice President-elect Ryan Park want candidates outside of USG to serve in their executive cabinet.

The executive cabinet works closely with the president and vice president during the year. The positions available in the cabinet include senior director of communication, chief of staff and treasurer.
They will be evaluating the applications on a number of different criteria, but Kurth said that prior USG experience is not necessarily required. Rather, the candidates will be evaluated on their dedication to the university and their ability to lead others to work as advocates for positive change.
“It’s important to us to have students who want to tangibly change the university for the better,” Kurth said. “We have a lot of talented kids in the system already who want to continue to be in the system, but we’re leaving the door open for other students who want to contribute new and different ideas.”
Current USG Vice President Vinnie Prasad said that rather than only considering students with USG experience, Kurth and Park will aim to diversify the committees by looking outwards to students with other backgrounds.
“It’s really important for us to reach out to other areas of the school where students don’t really know about these leadership positions,” Prasad said. “We need to do a better job of reaching out to athletes, international students, commuter students and other groups that are big parts of the student body, who should have a say in how their school is run.”
Kurth and Park will also be hiring a new executive director and finance director to head USG’s Program Board. Students can apply for director and assistant director positions to head the Funding Board and each of the six committees within USG’s Advocacy Branch.
Kurth said that a large number of students from the Greek community, in particular, are involved with the committees of the Advocacy Branch, and that a more diverse group of leaders is needed to accurately represent the interests of the student body as a whole.
“The majority of students who end up in the advocacy branch are Greek, and that’s great,” Kurth said. “But we really want to excite people in other areas of the campus who come from different backgrounds and who have different ideas and opinions.”
Applications for USG leadership positions became available Tuesday night on the USG website and are due March 15.
