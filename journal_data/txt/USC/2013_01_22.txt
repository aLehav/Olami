The USC Men’s Swimming and Diving team picked up another first place win at the Southern Methodist University (SMU) Swim Classic in Dallas over the long weekend. Coming in at No. 5 in the country, the Trojans finished first with 330 points, swimming past the Michigan Wolverines (327). The University of Florida came in third (318) and was followed by Louisville (249), Purdue (226) and SMU (223).
In the same competition last year, the Trojans also earned the No. 5 national ranking. They won both relays and three of seven individual races to finish a close second to Michigan.
The Trojans began the event in strong fashion, ending day one (Saturday) of the two-day classic behind Michigan. They were able to cut the deficit thanks to superb performances by a few veteran members. Junior Vladimir Morozov clocked in a new personal best in the 100-yard freestyle, while senior Alex Lendrum won the 200y backstroke, and junior Dimitri Colupaev won the 200y IM.
The Trojans entered the final event behind Michigan by a point, but their 200y free relay of juniors Jack Wagner, Morozov, and Chase Bloch and sophomore Cristian Quintero glided into first with a season-best 1:19.08, beating Michigan by 0.49.
The competition was filled with record-breaking performances and high-place finishes. Earlier in the meet, Troy’s 200y medley relay of Lendrum, Colupaev, Bloch and Morozov was second in 1:26.63. Morozov, who tied the school record in the 100y breaststroke on Friday in addition to winning the 50y free, won the 100y free Saturday in 41.70, which established an NCAA ‘A’ cut and lowered his 2012 school record, previously set at 41.86.
Lendrum won the 200y back in 1:44.03, winning by more than a second, while Colupaev took first in the 200y IM in 1:45.07, edging Michigan’s Kyle Whitaker by 0.18. Freshman Morten Klarskov won the ‘B’ final of the race in 1:46.95.
The swim and dive men will try to keep the momentum going with a back-to-back coming up against Berkeley and Stanford on February 8th and 9th.

Author, speaker and Holocaust survivor Eva Schloss spoke to a full-capacity crowd Tuesday night at Bovard Auditorium about the human stories hidden by the terrible genocide of the Holocaust.
Holocaust survivor · Eve Schloss discusses the Holocaust experience to a packed audience of students in Bovard Auditorium. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The event, hosted by USC Chabad and USC Shoah Foundation, featured Schloss, who is best known as the childhood friend and posthumous step-sister of Holocaust victim Anne Frank, whose diary became an international bestseller. Born in Vienna, Austria in 1929, Schloss’ life was changed forever during the Nazi invasion of 1938.
Schloss spoke with clear recollection of those early war years.
“It was a great shock to us,” Schloss said. “Life changed immediately. Being a Jew became very difficult.”
Facing anti-Semitism and possible arrest, Schloss’ father sought a business opportunity in Holland. It is here where she first met Frank.
Schloss remembered what Frank said to her when they first met.
“My name is Anne, and my family comes from Germany, and I can speak German to you.” Frank told Schloss.
This sparked an immediate friendship, though the two were, in Schloss’ words, “completely different types.”
“I was a tomboy,” Schloss said. “I loved sports. I was also quite shy. Anne was a big chatterbox.”
Schloss also remembered Frank’s obsession with the opposite sex, emphasized in her famous diary.
“When I explained to her that I had an older brother, her eyes grew big,” Schloss said of Frank. “She was very interested in boys.”
The girls’ relationship ended with the Nazi occupation of Holland, which forced both families into hiding. Schloss  said she felt immense boredom during this period, with no interest in reading or writing. This, however, was unlike her brother Heinz, an accomplished musician, painter and poet whose work Schloss advertises to this day.
After two years, the family was betrayed, arrested and crammed into train cars. When Schloss and hundreds of fellow Jewish families arrived at their destination, they were crushed.
“We knew Auschwitz was the biggest death camp,” Schloss said. “We had hoped it was a labor camp.”
Schloss said she and her mother were then separated from their male family members and how the women in the camp were completely dehumanized, forced to shave their heads and live on two small meals a day.
“That is really how they wanted us to feel – not like human beings, like animals,” Schloss said.
Of the two families, only Schloss, her mother and Anne Frank’s father, Otto, survived the nine months of captivity. Schloss attributes her survival to mental strength and hope for a better future.
“I had a beautiful family life before the war,” Schloss said. “I wanted to have a boyfriend, a family. I wanted to experience life.”
Schloss told the audience how her mother would later marry Otto Frank, making the two girls step sisters. Otto Frank served as a grandfather to Schloss’ children, and the two shared a mission to publish Anne Frank’s diary. Initial attempts were not fruitful, according to Schloss, as guilt surrounding the Holocaust prevented most media coverage of the subject.
“There was a huge [feeling of guilt] in the world,” Schloss said. “Both Jews and Christians wanted to push it under the table and move on.”
The diary eventually found a publisher and became famous throughout the world. Schloss highlighted the common misconception about her step sister’s story.
Schloss highlighted the story is one much more than the Holocaust.
“Anne’s story was not a Holocaust story,” Schloss said. “It was the story of a young girl.”
Students and visitors in the packed auditorium were struck by the power of Schloss’ words. Ross Denny-Jiles, a freshman majoring in theatre, commended her dedication to anti-genocide work.
“Sometimes we forget about these types of things when we don’t live in an area where we see them everyday,” Denny-Jiles said. “It’s good to be reminded that there is still hatred in the world.”
To Schloss, individual human goodness, which she saw in Heinz Schloss and Anne Frank, is the only way to counteract the evil brought on by outright xenophobia.
“The power of good is immeasurable,” Schloss said. “So is that of hope, optimism and resilience.”
Schloss was careful to point out, however, that she sees herself not as a hero, but as a survivor.
“Survivors aren’t heroes,” Schloss said. “The people that put themselves in harm’s way when they didn’t have to be — the resistance fighters — those are the real heroes.”

After a comeback attempt against No. 21 Oregon that fell just short on Thursday night, USC men’s basketball was still looking for their first win under interim head coach Bob Cantu.
More buckets · The Trojans were led by the high-scoring ways of Wesley (19 points), Wise (18 points) and Terrell (11 points). – Ankur Agrawal | Daily Trojan
The Trojans finally got that win by clinging to a one-point lead as time expired in a 69-68 victory over Oregon State at the Galen Center Saturday night.
Though Oregon State (10-8, 0-5) had lost all four of its Pac-12 conference games heading into the matchup, a tough Beaver defense put pressure on USC (8-11, 3-3) and enabled them to overcome a double-digit deficit in the second half.
“At the end there we gave up a 15-point lead, which I was disappointed with, but the guys didn’t give up,” Cantu said. “To come out here tonight and to be able to get this win is a great thing for us moving forward.”
The Trojans and Beavers played a tight game for most of the first half but a late 8-0 run allowed USC to pull ahead by as many as nine points. Senior center James Blasczyk helped solidify a 39-31 lead going into halftime with a buzzer-beating dunk off a missed jumper by sophomore guard Byron Wesley, who would end the game with a season-high 19 points.
USC emerged from the locker room after halftime with renewed energy, putting up seven unanswered points and forcing Oregon State to take an early timeout within the first two minutes. After those first quick-paced minutes, however, the team struggled to penetrate the Beaver 1-3-1 zone defense.
“They just did a great job defensively,” said senior guard Jio Fontan. “That zone is really different from anything we’ve seen so far, so when you throw something so sporadically at us it’s kind of hard to make adjustments.”
The team also struggled with turnovers, coughing up 20 total, which is more than their average of 13.6 per game and double what they committed against Oregon in Cantu’s first game as interim head coach.
And like the outcome against Oregon on Thursday night, the game came down to the last second, with the lead changing eight times in the final minutes. Trailing by one with less than a minute to play, USC turned the ball over and seemingly squandered its chances at victory. But a steal by senior forward Eric Wise on the ensuing inbounds pass was converted into a layup, and the Trojans led once again.
The Beavers were able to answer on their next possession when Joe Burton scored with less than 12 seconds remaining to give Oregon State the lead once again. Again in need of a late score, junior guard J.T. Terrell raced up the court and dropped a pass off to senior forward Aaron Fuller, whose only basket of the night turned out to be the game-winner.
With 4.8 seconds left on the clock, Oregon State had one last chance to take the lead. But Wise, who finished the night with 18 points, blocked Oregon State’s final shot to secure the team’s first win under Cantu.
 
“It’s extremely exciting,” said Wesley. “Cantu’s been here for 12 years now and to be a part of his first win, I couldn’t be happier for him.”
Cantu also expressed his excitement, but noted that the win was especially important for the players, who he credited for making adjustments during a tough week. The team found out last Sunday that coach Kevin O’Neill had been fired and that Cantu, then assistant coach, would be filling in.
“They’re a great bunch of guys and they work hard and this has obviously been a difficult week for them,” Cantu said. “But I’m just happy we got the win.”
During the post-game press conference, he spoke briefly about what the win meant to him personally, but more about stepping into his new role.
“[Getting this first win] feels great,” Cantu said. “When a 15-point lead starts evaporating, your blood pressure definitely goes up a little bit, but I’m excited and feeling more comfortable every day.”
Several players referred to the week as long and hectic, but are focused on moving forward and playing competitive ball against two more Pac-12 conference teams next week.
“This week has dragged out but we made the best of it,” Fontan said. “We came up short Thursday in a game that we probably should have won and got the job today in a game that should’ve been a little bit easier but the week’s over and we’re glad we got the split.”
USC hits the road next week for more Pac-12 play against Arizona State (Jan. 24) and Arizona (Jan. 26).

Though the team rallied late in the second half to put the No. 6 Stanford Cardinal on the ropes, the USC women’s basketball team ultimately came up short on Sunday night, falling by a final score of 75-66. It was USC’s second straight loss, leaving them winless on their yearly Northern California road trip. It was also the team’s 11th straight defeat at the hands of Stanford.
The Women of Troy (7-10, 4-2) trailed for the majority of the game and were down by as many as 19 points during the second half before rallying late. They cut the deficit to five with under two minutes to play, but the Cardinal (16-2, 5-1) locked down USC’s offense thereafter to secure the win.
USC was led by the 21 points of junior forward Cassie Harberts, who also added seven rebounds and two 3-pointers. She was nine of 12 from the free-throw line and joins USC’s top-ten list of made free throws for a career. She, along with sophomore forward Alexyz Vaioletama, played all 40 minutes for the Trojans in the loss.
Vaioletama was one of three players to hit double digits for the team with 10 points. The other two were Harberts and sophomore guard Ariya Crook, who scored 16 of her 18 points in the second half.
The majority of the Cardinal scoring came from junior forward Chiney Ogwumike, who finished with 29 points, 23 of which came in the second half. She also contributed a game-high 16 rebounds. She had some help from senior forward Joslyn Tinkle, who had 15 points, while junior guard Sara James and sophomore guard Amber Orrange each added 13.
Neither team shot the ball particularly well in the first half, as USC finished 33 percent from the field while Stanford shot a slightly better 35 percent. Both teams warmed up in the second half, as they matched each other at 47 percent for the entire contest.
Midway through the first half, the teams were locked at 11-11 before Stanford started to heat up and went on a 7-0 run to take a 20-13 lead. The Trojans would come back to cut the Cardinal lead to two at 20-18 with five minutes to play, but Stanford scored 13 of the next 15 points to pull ahead 33-20 at halftime.
The Women of Troy fell behind by as much as 19 points in the first four minutes of the second half. Once again, though, the team fought back and a reverse layup from Crook with 2:42 to play cut the Trojans’ deficit to five at 66-61.
“We’re a different team than we were five games ago,” Harberts said. “We got down to Utah and came back and that’s been our mindset since conference started.”
From that point on though, it was all Ogwumike, who scored seven of Stanford’s last nine points to ward off the Trojans and stay atop the Pac-12 alongside Cal.
When USC left Los Angeles for their two-game Northern California road trip, they sat atop the conference with rival UCLA. With Sunday’s loss, the Trojans drop to a four-way tie for third in the Pac-12 standings with UCLA, Colorado and Washington.
“We’re going to need to continue to play as a team should we want to be successful in our conference,” Crook said. “That means playing fundamentally sound basketball by driving into the paint, sharing the ball with our teammates and getting easy shots.”
USC was out-rebounded by a ratio of 41-25 over the course of the game and a big reason for that was the loss of the team’s second leading rebounder, senior forward Christina Marinacci, who missed her fourth straight game because of a strained knee sustained in practice two weeks ago.
The team returns home to the Galen Center to host the Arizona schools starting with the Arizona State Sun Devils (10-8, 2-4) on Friday, Jan. 25, and the Arizona Wildcats (11-6, 3-3) on Sunday, Jan. 27. Both teams are coming off blowout defeats in their previous contests.

Stretched between two tournaments, the USC women’s tennis team came out of the weekend with plenty of momentum following their performances in Las Vegas and Palm Springs.
The Freeman Memorial Tennis Championships tournament in Las Vegas proved to be the more successful of the two trips, as sophomore Sabrina Santamaria took home the doubles title while paired with junior Kaitlyn Christian along with her own singles title.
The tournament featured conference rivals Stanford and UCLA, while UNLV and the University of North Carolina also were in the field.
Santamaria easily won the day as she and Christian showed why they are rated the nation’s best doubles pairing. The heralded duo notched an 8-4 win over UCLA’s tandem of Courtney Dolehide and Pamela Montez in the semifinals before defeating the UNC duo of Ashley Dai and Whitney Kay in the finals.
Seniors Danielle Lao and Valeria Pulido reached the semifinal round, but fell to the eventual runner-up team of Dai and Kay.
In the singles’ division, USC and UNC separated themselves from the rest of the tournament field, with each team represented by three girls in the quarterfinals.
Lao and Santamaria each made it out of the top six, but Christian did not advance to the semifinals.
From there, Santamaria and UNC’s Gina Suarez-Malaguti, who ranked No. 2 in the tournament and No. 11 nationally, squared off in the finals. Santamaria capped off her big day in a mild upset with a 6-0, 6-1 drubbing.
Back in California, the rest of the team almost matched their teammates’ performance in Las Vegas, but fell short once again to the crosstown rival Bruins.
With sophomore Zoe Scandalis — the only veteran and ranked player -— attending the tournament, the Women of Troy came in as the heavy underdogs, with UCLA bringing their top team to Palm Springs, Calif. Both the singles and doubles divisions ended up with a pair of USC and UCLA players in the semifinals.
In singles, No. 6 Robin Anderson of UCLA took down a pair of USC sophomores as she defeated sophomore Gabriella DeSimone before winning a hard-fought finals battle against sophomore Giuliana Olmos, who is in her first season with the program.
“For us in Palm Springs, Guiliana [Olmos] had match point on Robin Anderson — and remember this is her first college tournament,” coach USC coach Richard Gallien said. “She’s done a super job out of the gate and we couldn’t be happier to have her on the team.”
In the semifinal round for doubles, Anderson and Morton got the best of Olmos and freshman Ellie Yates while DeSimone and Scandalis defeated the UCLA tandem of Harrison and Ray.
The doubles’ final had Anderson and her partner Skylar Morton square off against a Women of Troy team composed of DeSimone and Scandalis. UCLA triumphed in the championship match with Anderson and Morton taking down DeSimone and Scandalis by an 8-6 margin.
With a team full of depth, it will be interesting to note the varying lineups that the Women of Troy trot out on a week-by-week basis.
“This year we will see more flexibility [in the lineup] — we have eight excellent players and try to move things around a little bit, we want everyone to be competing and playing hard,” Gallien said. “The whole thing is a sales job to help the girls understand the better our practices are and the more competitive our practice matches are, the better prepared we will be for the tough teams we’ll have to play.”
All in all, Gallien was pleased that the Women of Troy had a valuable experience against strong competition, especially for the newcomers and younger players.
“We have a really tough team and we’ll be able to compete with everyone on our schedule,” Gallien said. “Hopefully we are in a healthy place and playing our best tennis by the end of the year and, as far as where I see our team today, we have a bunch of battlers and we love our team.”

Interim USC coach Bob Cantu picked up his first victory of the season Saturday night in a thrilling 69-68 victory over the Oregon State Beavers. The Trojans scored the go-ahead bucket with less than five seconds remaining and sealed the contest by blocking junior forward Devon Collier’s shot as time expired.
But the game should never have been so close. It’s far too early to judge Cantu on his performance, but the same can’t be said for this group of players. Recently dismissed USC coach Kevin O’Neill was the sacrificial lamb for a team that was hovering around mediocrity, and he certainly deserves blame for failing to deliver a winner. Ultimately, though, the Trojans — who nicknamed themselves the “second- chance kids” — have been a model of inconsistency all season long.
The biggest example of inconsistency stems from the backcourt. Senior point guard Jio Fontan has essentially been given a free pass from the coaching staff all season long, despite the fact that he’s shooting just 32.5 percent from the field. In USC’s win over Oregon State, Fontan finished with eight points (his season average is 8.4) and 10 turnovers. Coming back from an ACL injury, as Fontan is doing, is certainly never easy. I sympathize with his recovery and am glad he’s been able to return to the court. But his play just hasn’t been up to par compared to what was expected of him.
Junior guard J.T. Terrell is also struggling. He was benched earlier in the season for poor play, and, since his return to the starting lineup, has shot the ball slightly better. There isn’t a body of work that would point to him keeping that up, though. He’s still shooting a dismal 32.4 percent from the floor and just 32.7 percent on his 3-point attempts (same as Fontan). USC’s starting guards were supposed to be the team’s strength before the year started. Instead, Fontan and Terrell have been the poster boys for erratic performances. This team won’t pull off any Pac-12 upsets unless the duo starts shooting the ball at a higher clip, at least converting on closer to 40 percent of their attempts.
The rest of the roster isn’t absolved from blame either. Sophomore forward Byron Wesley has been turning in better stat lines of late but also had a string of five straight games with less than 10 points. Junior forward Dewayne Dedmon is playing less than 23 minutes per game, moving in and out of the lineup with junior center Omar Oraby. Junior forward Ari Stewart and senior forward Renaldo Woolridge, two transfers who were expected to contribute for the Trojans, are averaging less minutes per game than freshman walk-on guard Chass Bryan.
The one exception to what has otherwise been a roller-coaster ride on both sides of the court is senior forward Eric Wise.
The UC Irvine transfer, who was responsible for the game-winning block against the Beavers, leads the team in points per game (12.5), field goal percentage (51.7), and is second in rebounds (4.9) plus third in assists (1.5). He’s scored in double figures in all but three games and has emerged as USC’s most dependable player by far.
Wise still isn’t counted on to be the de facto No. 1 option when he’s on the court, but he ought to be. He has established himself as the lone go-to player on a team that struggles to find consistent output on a game-by-game basis.
Ultimately, there’s a difference between having a bevy of depth and not being able to find a dependable group of players who can log major minutes. This team’s identity entering the season built upon “us against the world” mentality. Most of the players didn’t have much experience playing with each other, but that was supposed to unite them collectively. Now we’re nearing February in the heart of conference play and the Trojans don’t look much closer to figuring things out. It’s possible this group just isn’t capable of developing a cohesive unit as currently constituted. But the talent is still there, and there’s precious little time remaining to right the ship.
It’s now or never for the “second-chance kids” to live up to their nickname, or this season will end with USC as an afterthought in the Pac-12.

The reigning NCAA national champion men’s tennis team began its campaign for a record fifth consecutive title this past weekend with strong individual and doubles performances at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
Easy win · Junior Ray Sarmiento took home the singles championship at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup with a comeback win against UCLA. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The tournament showcased nationally ranked talent from UCLA, Baylor, Stanford and Cal. USC, however, held its own: in doubles competition, the Trojans advanced three doubles teams to the semi-final rounds. Eric Johnson and teammate Emilio Gomez faced off against fellow Trojans Ray Sarmiento and Yannick Hanfmann. Hanfmann, who as a freshman won the singles match that clinched the NCAA team championship last season, was forced to retire from the match because of injury.
Johnson and Gomez went on to face third-seeded UCLA tandem Marcos Giron and Dennis Novikov in the final. The match came down to the wire, with Giron and Novikov eking out an 8-7 (4) victory.
Hanfmann’s partner, Sarmiento, was the No. 1 seed in the men’s singles draw. Sarmiento cruised through the early rounds without dropping a set, dispatching three Bruins in knockout stages en route to the championship match, which took place Monday.
During the match, Sarmiento faced Adrien Puget of UCLA. After dropping the first set 4-6, Sarmiento would go on to capture the second set 6-3. In the deciding set, Sarmiento saved match point and played what USC coach Peter Smith called “some of the best tennis [he’s] seen” to secure the victory 7-5. Smith noted that “both players looked tense” in the early going and attributed Sarmiento’s success to his aggressive play.
Though the results did not measure up to last year’s Collegiate Cup, where the Trojans swept the trophies and dominated the draw, Smith had plenty of reason to be optimistic about the year’s prospects.
“We started [the tournament] really strong and we’re going to improve in the coming weeks,” Smith said. “[The players] need to get more comfortable playing in [their] new positions.”
The new positions are partly the result of the graduation of five-time All-American Steve Johnson. Johnson was the 2011 NCAA singles champion and a significant contributor to the Trojans’ recent title runs. Despite his absence, the Trojans are ranked No. 2 in the nation and continue to field a dominant squad of players — many of whom are returning from last year’s NCAA title team.
The Trojans face San Diego State for the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Kick-Off Week at Marks Stadium this Friday, Jan. 25, at 1 p.m.

The USC men’s volleyball team headed into last weekend looking to build on its decisive victory over top-ranked UC Irvine. It faced off against two other highly regarded teams, this time with mixed results.
Not quite enough · Two days after a home victory against the No. 2 Stanford Cardinal, the Men of Troy struggled to keep up with the No. 15 Pacific Tigers on Sunday. USC lost the match three sets to one. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
 
The first match of the weekend pitted USC against No. 2 Stanford. The Cardinal came into the game riding the momentum of an undefeated season and were looking to add to their impressive resume.
The Trojans took control of the match early on with a 9-5 lead, but the resilient Cardinal quickly rallied to even the set at 14. From there, the two teams went back and forth until a decisive triple block by freshman outside hitter Alex Slaught, sophomore setter Micah Christenson and sophomore middle blocker Ben Lam gave USC the momentum it needed to finish off the Cardinal in overtime, 27-25.
The second set was less stressful for the Men of Troy, as they handily put away their rivals with a score of 25-18. Stanford surged back in the third set, taking an early lead. The Trojans shook off the slow start and quickly evened the game at 14. The set continued to go back and forth until junior opposite hitter Tanner Jansen finished off the Cardinal with a kill in overtime that gave USC the set 29-27 and the match overall.
“Everybody stepped up and did something big,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “Our freshmen in particular, Alex [Slaught] and Brooks [Varni], are both doing a great job right now.”
The win ended Stanford’s undefeated start and gave USC its second win in three games against ranked opponents.
However, the weekend quickly turned sour for the Trojans, who faced a tough matchup against the No. 15 Pacific Tigers on Sunday afternoon.
The Tigers, who had not beaten the Trojans in volleyball since early 2007, took advantage of a sluggish performance by USC. The Tigers set the tone early in the match, taking an 8-3 lead in the first game and never letting go. Aided by some acrobatic plays by sophomore libero Javier Caceres, Pacific took the first set 25-18.
In the second set, the Trojans looked as if they were getting the momentum back with a quick 8-2 start. Pacific soon went on a tear, though, winning 10 of the next 13 points and extinguishing the Trojans’ brief hot streak. Pacific took the lead and never relinquished, winning the second set 25-21.
The highlight of the match for the Trojans came later on, when some lineup changes sparked USC to pick up a third-set victory. With the team looking sluggish after dropping the first two sets, Ferguson decided that a swap was needed.
“[Freshman] Josh Kirchner and [junior] Chris Trefzger did an impressive job of coming in and re-energizing our team,” Ferguson said.
Their contributions in the third set allowed USC to even the score at 21. From there, the two squads traded points ending with a decisive kill by USC redshirt sophomore outside hitter Joey Booth. With that, the Trojans took the third set and seemed to be back in the match.
Despite another exciting comeback in the fourth set, USC was unable to overtake the Tigers. After coughing up a 17-12 lead, Pacific was able to hold onto their lead and take the set 27-25 along with the match 3-1.
“We weren’t as mature as we could’ve been in prepping for this,” Ferguson said. “We’re a young team but that’s no excuse. We still have to play the matches and we still have to execute and we didn’t.”
Though they were the lower-ranked team, Pacific outplayed USC in most areas of the box score. The Tigers out hit the Trojans by a mark of 25.4 percent to 18.1 percent, which was USC’s lowest mark since its season-opening loss to UC San Diego. The numbers from the service line also favored the visiting team, with Pacific’s 87.3 percent mark trumping USC’s 84.9 percent.
Despite the disappointing loss, this young team might still be able to look forward to a high ranking in the NCAA polls after knocking off the top two teams in the nation. Some rest will also likely benefit the crew: USC has nearly two weeks until their next match against Pepperdine.
It is the job of a good head coach to prepare his team for every match. You lose at home to a #15 ranked team
is terrible. Two losses to bottom rung schools. Where is the non-conference matches to start the season to find
out the strength and weaknesses of your own squad before conference play? Except for two players from Hawaii
the out of state players with good size have shown very, very little.

Chaz Bundick, known by his stage name Toro Y Moi, is known more for his catchy singles than he is for producing comprehensive albums. Starting with 2010’s Causers of This and the college-radio hits “Talamak,” and “Low Shoulder” and then continuing with “Still Sound” off of 2011’s Underneath the Pine, Bundick has created some great staples of any introductory chillwave mix, but nothing in his past was indicative of his ability to craft an album such as the new Anything in Return. The genre-labeling confusion that obscures most of the conversation around Toro Y Moi will prove to be a deciding factor on the enjoyability of the album.
Music man · Bundick’s latest sound feels more accessible than anything he has produced to date; many of his songs have a lighter vibe. – Photo courtesy of Patrick Jeffords
As a subgenre, chillwave has garnered a bad reputation over the years as the stereotypical soundtrack for today’s apathetic teens and for flaunting a signature formula for the sound: ’80s dance hooks with heavily filtered vocals. What tends to get overlooked are the almost mystical elements of the genre — how groups managed to find each other and create a new genre mainly through the connective power of the Internet. Regardless, chillwave has fallen from being the shining star of the electronic music world to functioning as the backing track for professionally maintained (yet somehow danceable) detachment.
In the past, Bundick courted this labeling yet somehow avoided it at the same time. Instead, he typically is categorized within the more general field of disco/house and does not seem to care about how his music gets labeled. That hasn’t stopped some of his buddies, such as Odd Future rapper Tyler, the Creator, coming out and saying definitively that “Toro is not chillwave.”
Thankfully, Anything In Return sounds less like well-crafted apathy and more like summer coming early. It isn’t a stretch to imagine the album forming soundtracks for the kind of crowd that doesn’t get much of a kick out of dubstep or similar-sounding party music — the crowd that wouldn’t mind living poolside for most of the year. Though there’s a certain amount of negative connotation  built into the idea, chillwave has never shied away from such an idea and neither has pop music in general.
From the very start, the album is more accessible than anything Bundick has done before. “Harm in Change,” the leadoff track, brings the heavy bass out quicker than anything he’s written and contains more of the traditional tropes of more popular remixes of Bundick’s songs than his old songs themselves: vocal samples trotted out alongside his own take, an EDM-friendly bass drum breakdown at the end and wailing synths spinning up and down.
Further transitioning into what sounds like pure remix bait, “Say That” uses more high-pitched diva samples to complement Bundick’s own singing, but switches from a likely dance track to something more at home among house lovers.
The third track, “So Many Details,” obscures Bundick’s normally weak vocals by alternating between a breakdown with his whispery vocals above a tinny synth and a danceable breakdown beat that grows even more frantic as the song comes to its conclusion.
“Cake” is the biggest highlight of all, immediately both the most radio-friendly track and the most clearly sung song on the album. It’s a shining example of how chillwave and pop are in no way mutually exclusive, and is also just a fun song. Sure, it’s a mostly vapid tune about love (“She knows / I’ma be her boy forever”), but it’s fun and you could take apart countless other pop songs for being similarly boring and none would be as close to as fun as “Cake.”
The penultimate cut, “Never Matter,” sounds more like a track from fellow Californian-group Poolside than it does Toro Y Moi: It strikes the perfect balance of pop and chillwave that Bundick seems to have been aiming for his entire career. It has the synths, the poppy hook and the distorted and warped vocals.
To be fair, the album’s middle section is where curious listeners might go to die (just about every track can sound like the same, light-synth, acid-washed fluff that lends chillwave its negative connotations). But if you can turn off the critical section of your brain and just enjoy the sound of summer and a good pop album, Anything in Return succeeds admirably at providing sound, enjoyable entertainment.
If you can’t manage to stop trying to pick apart the group, however, you’re better off listening to the first half and “Cake” and forgetting the rest of the tracks even exist. Still, on its whole, the album shows a marked improvement in Bundick’s musicianship and its lighter, more crowd-pleasing tracks might make more people decide to take the plunge and listen to the album all the way through.

Welcome to the first edition of New Noise, which will examine the top tracks released in the previous week. Each week, this column will discuss the songs that are making news either on the charts or on the streets. The spotlighted genres will rotate each week, so no worries — there’s no music discrimination here.
THE RAP
Last week was a great week for rap and hip-hop, with a plethora of dynamite tracks being released from the best underground labels. Just a heads up, though: This list is definitely discriminating against Auto-tune abuse. So if the sound of Mario, Luigi and Pacman singing with marbles in their mouths is music to your ears, then you might have to skip over this list.
A$AP Rocky featuring Florence Welch: “I Come Apart”
At only 24 years old, A$AP Rocky has already dipped his toes in controversy, overhype and legal troubles. His debut album Long.Live.A$AP was released on Jan. 15 and his single, with Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine ended up working wonders. “I Come Apart” features Welch’s ethereal vocals. The songstress and the rapper harmonize perfectly on the track and transform the song into a beautiful mash-up.
Flatbush Zombies: “When In Roam”
The Brooklyn collective is quickly gaining attention in the underground community for its tight beats and seamless flows. “When In Roam” is deliciously sparse (especially in terms of rap nowadays) and features a lot of Tupac references (unless I’m the only one who thinks of ’Pac every time I hear the words “Hail Mary”). With lyrics that actually involve more than cars, girls and bravado, the track is an oasis of originality in the desert that is Top 40 rap.
Da Brat: “Talk To Me”
Da Brat! “You’ve been So So Missed.” In her comeback track “Talk To Me,” the legendarily raucous femcee spits her trademark rapid rhymes with a rocked-out beat that demands attention. The Blue Rocks-produced track has a cocky Da Brat talking the language of money, and if you can’t speak it, prepare to be verbally annihilated by The Bratty One. Of course, that would actually be kind of an honor.
Kool G Rap featuring Big Noyd and Large Professor: “Naturally Born”
Queens rapper Kool G Rap is an icon for NYC rap, no question. His latest single, “Naturally Born,” is refreshingly trademark KGR. The track has no superfluities, no bravado and no filler — “Naturally Born” is just straight up real hip-hop that perfectly captures the sound of the golden age of NYC rap that KGR was so vital in helping establish.
Atmosphere featuring Brother Ali, Carnage and Haphduzn: “It Ain’t The Prettiest”
Minneapolis isn’t just the city that Brenda and Brandon Walsh hail from (…anyone?) — it’s also home to some of the greatest musicians and bands, especially when it comes to underground hip-hop. In honour of March 1st’s Welcome To Minnesota tour, the usual Rhymesayer suspects released “It Ain’t The Prettiest.” Atmosphere virtually never disappoints and this track is no different. For hip-hop fans unacquainted with Rhymesayer talent, this song is a great place to start.
 
THE POP
Talk about diverse! The pop releases of last week were all over the map, chock full of reunions, long-awaited comebacks and secret shame for being impressed by a Willow Smith song.
Santigold: “Girls”
Written for the hit HBO series Girls, the epically cool Santigold put out a new video with the release of her single of the same name. The steady alt-dance track is crafted in Santigold’s signature mix of reggae fusion and New Wave. Plus, the song and video are 10 times more enjoyable than the show, so that helps.
Justin Timberlake featuring Jay Z: “Suit and Tie”
By now, you’ve all probably heard about Timberlake’s important announcement, which he oh-so-non-insecurely released on the weekend the Oscar nominees were announced. As narcissistic as the dude might be, however, no one can deny that when he’s making music, he’s pretty much owning it. “Suit And Tie” is Timberlake’s first statement in his return to music and though it’s not mind-blowing, it’s great enough to realize that he has been long missed in the pop world.
Destiny’s Child: “Nuclear”
This reunion almost came out of nowhere, but DC is back (at least for one track) and it’s like they never left. “Nuclear” is a throwback dance song with the girls’ perfectly melding vocals complementing the vintage sound. Though the track is hanging out slightly above mediocre, it’s still a welcome return from one of the biggest girl groups in music.
Dido: “No Freedom”
Where did Dido go? No matter, she’s back. Dido fans will definitely enjoy the soft “No Freedom,” which employs her trademark soft-pop style and pensive lyrics. Dido’s sound hasn’t changed much in her absence, but clearly it ain’t broke, so why fix it?
Willow Smith: “Sugar And Spice”
You have no idea how ready I was to hate on this song … but then I heard it. When your only reference point of Willow Smith is the maddening repetition of “Iwhipmyhairbackandforth,” this song is just unreal. Sampling Radiohead’s “Codex,” “Sugar And Spice” is surprisingly despondent and showcases the 12-year-old’s amazing (yes, I said amazing) vocals. Clearly whipping her hair did Smith some good.

Here is a quick rundown of everything else going on in music this week: 
THE ALT/PUNK
Cloakroom: “Mind Funeral”
Ex-Grown Ups rockers build an ambiance from the ground up and fill it with beautiful distortion, making for the perfect stoner-metal landscape. More please!
Ex Friends: “Rainy Season”
Why does nearly every punk band sound like a Rancid ripoff nowadays? Regardless, “Rainy Season” is proper vintage punk, with a touch of the British Oi! sound.
Fur Of Heaven: A Year Without Teeth (EP)
OK, this is cheating because it’s an EP, but just in case you feel like throwing out your vocals, this is the EP for you. From the melodic breaks in the thrashing “Willow,” to the hammering “Alder” and the trouncing beats of “Ash” and “Mahogany,” these are the toughest trees you’ve ever come across in your life.
 THE INDIE
Streets of Laredo: “Girlfriend”
The Brooklyn-based New Zealanders know how to write a track. This song is pure ear candy with thunderous drums and upbeat arrangements. Plus, they’re wise enough to know that everything’s better with a tambourine.
Shugo Tokumaru: “Katachi”
The Japanese Superman strikes again! “Katachi” is possibly the greatest mixing of genres in one song — an East Asian twang and a frantic Celtic-sounding flute hold up the perfect pop melody. This is what mad talent sounds like.
Ivan & Alyosha: “Running For Cover”
As always, Ivan & Alyosha don’t fail to deliver. The song is pensive with the steady acoustic guitar paving the way into a simple, yet arcane musical air. But really, who even cares about the song? This band is amazing because they chose the greatest band name ever. It’s that simple.

Crude and juvenile but also a story that might be useful for gamers to meditate on, Noobz, a comedy directed and co-written by Blake Freeman, follows a group of competitive gamers who travel to Los Angeles to compete for a $400,000 championship prize.
Noobz seems incredibly unsure of itself with regard to how it wants to approach the gamer demographic as an audience. On the one hand, the film includes its fair share of bonuses for people familiar with gamer culture, such as the eccentric supporting character Greg “Armagreggon” Lipstein, an ex-arcade game champion and a clear parody of Donkey Kong high-scorer Billy Mitchell, with perhaps just a dash of Ben Stiller’s personality thrown in.
On the other hand, the portrayal of many gamers in Noobz straddles (and repeatedly crouches on top of) the line between “offensively exaggerated stereotype” and “pointed, if brutal, critique.”
The main gamer characters are particularly difficult to like, as they are characterized as maladjusted misanthropes with misplaced priorities.
In the opening scenes of the film, middle-aged gamer Cody, played by Freeman, loses both his job and his wife because of his fixation on gaming and his inability to respond maturely to conflict. The gaming championship becomes his midlife quest for relevance, assisted by his best friend Andy, played by Jason Mewes, who is well within his comfort zone playing the perpetual man-child who works behind a counter. It’s a familiar buddy dynamic, with the constantly sour Cody resisting Andy’s attempts to cheer him up.
The other half of Cody and Andy’s gaming quartet consists of Oliver (played by Matt Shively), whose effeminate personality and over-the-top affectations of heterosexuality are mocked by his teammates and played for laughs and, “Hollywood,” (played by Moises Arias), an asthmatic whose ever-present oxygen tank and breathing mask receive a similar comedic treatment. Moviegoers with particularly sensitive sympathies for the LGBT community or the handicapped will probably find many of the jokes to be in poor taste, though the degree to which the script is being crude versus the characters playing true to macho gamer stereotypes isn’t always clear.
There are also two key subplots: Armagreggon’s self-centered quest to reclaim the Frogger championship and Andy’s courtship of Rickie, played by Zelda Williams, a former clan teammate and leader of a competing all-female gaming clan.
For fans of comedies in the same vein, Noobz does little to change the basic formula. The components of the story will feel color-by-number to many: a group of friends on a road trip, with cameos by non-A-list celebrities as parodies of themselves (in this case, Casper Van Dien, who receives top billing for roughly 10 minutes of screen time) and quirky misfits competing in a “sport” of questionable legitimacy. One might imagine that cinephiles watching the movie together will compete to name past films that use the same conventions.
With regard to the story, Noobz plays like an amalgam of half of the major comedy films of the past decade, but with somewhat less cohesion and more game product placement. The climax of the film feels rushed and lacks real tension, with the bulk of the story having shifted to the development of the characters. Female hardcore gamers in particular might find the film’s conclusion patronizing, though to the film’s credit, Rickie is probably the most well-adjusted and reasonable character in the entire movie, to the point where her relationship with Andy borders on a wish-fulfillment fantasy of “the perfect gamer girl.”
Some of the more notable points of the film are: The gas station rest stop where Cody finds a greater understanding of himself after being chewed out by a foul-mouthed pre-teen girl, the sincere (if cliched) montage of Andy psyching himself up in front of a mirror before his date and the genuinely entertaining gag reel over the credits.
Perhaps the only thing saving Noobz from being dismissed altogether as an insulting attempt to cash in on videogame-playing moviegoers is that Freeman’s attitude toward gamers seems to be one of self-deprecation rather than spite. The film’s introduction paints a picture of gamer versus non-gamer class warfare, a view that comes off as bitter but isn’t atypical among gamers. Most of the gamer characters are difficult to like, but they aren’t generally rewarded for their failings and the audience is expected less to root for them than to simply be entertained by them. At one point, when freshly unemployed Cody looks games store manager Andy dead in the eye and asks him, “How do you even function in society, man?” Freeman, as director, seems to be pointing to Cody as an example for gamers to avoid emulating.
Whether a gamer viewer chooses to take Noobz as an insult or an invitation to introspection is up to them. Noobz is not a particularly good film, but the gamers who most resemble its characters — the unwittingly non-social and down-on-life — will be the ones to most enjoy and benefit from seeing it.

Scott Hoying, formerly a pop music major and self-professed “choir nerd” at USC, began his freshman year like any other college student with an interest in vocal music: His days were filled with school, friends and a whole lot of singing. Naturally, Hoying quickly found his home at USC in its a cappella choir community, where he joined the SoCal VoCals.

Hoying had no way of knowing, but at the time he was on the cusp of stardom, soon to become a founding member of the a capella group Pentatonix.
Pentatonix, a small group of five talented musicians, began its journey in 2011, when Hoying and two of his close friends from high school, Mitch Grassi and Kirstie Maldonado, decided to audition for The Sing Off. Hoying had heard about the show through friends in the the SoCal VoCals who had previously competed on it. He then began contemplating the start of an a cappella group of his own.
“I thought it would be cool to have a little group where we could go and belt it out, unlike most groups that have around 16 people,” Hoying said.
The group began with only three singers, but following the urgings of former VoCal, Ben Bram, Pentatonix added a bass and a beatboxer to its numbers. Finding a strong bass, Avi Kaplan, was relatively simple, but it longer to find the perfect beat boxer.
The group discovered Kevin Olusola online. Olusola had posted a viral video on YouTube where he showed off his beatboxing skills while simultaneously playing the cello.
“When we came across the video, we thought he was unbelievable. His musicianship was unreal,” Hoying said. “There was just something special about Kevin.”
After calling Olusola and offering to pay for his flight to Los Angeles for the show’s audition, the group was complete. Though some of them barely had time to get to know one another, the five singers came together musically in their audition, performing an interpretation of Lady Gaga’s “Telephone.”
That one audition kicked off an adventure through the show that has led the a cappella group to even greater things. The group went on to win Season 3 of The Sing Off and has taken the world of a cappella by storm, releasing an EP, touring the country and producing a number of hit cover songs on YouTube.
“That investment in Kevin’s plane ticket ended up being worth it all because our experience was just incredible,” Hoying said.
During its time on the show, Pentatonix performed hit songs such as Katy Perry’s “E.T.,” Usher’s “OMG” and even a Britney Spears medley, but one highlight of the show that Hoying mentioned was performing “The Dog Days Are Over” by Florence and the Machine during the competition’s semifinals.
“In the week leading up the performance, we literally felt like we were at the end of our ropes,” Hoying said. “Our dress rehearsal was a total disaster, but in the actual performance, everything came together and it was the most magical moment.”
The group’s successful performance in the semifinal secured Pentatonix a slot in the finale and a chance to win the show’s grand prize: $200,000 and a recording contract with Sony.
“I’ll never forget it — it was our best performance on the show, the audience went wild and I knew we were going to the finale,” Hoying said.
Since its big win, Pentatonix has released two EP’s, PTX Volume 1 and PTXmas, appeared on various television shows, performed around the country during its sold-out fall 2012 tour and continued to post covers of hit songs on YouTube.
The group is now planning to kick off the new year with an even bigger tour lineup for 2013, adding bigger performance venues, set pieces, lights and choreography.
“The audience can expect a total upgrade to everything we have done in the past,” Hoying said. “We’re definitely taking things to the next level and it’s exciting.”
Along with its 2013 tour, the group is also working on its second EP, which will feature more original songs by various members of the group.
“Our goal is to transition from doing mostly covers to mostly originals with the occasional cover,” Hoying said.
Though no release date has been set, the album is projected to come out early in the year.
The upcoming Pentatonix tour will kick off Thursday, Jan. 24 with a concert at the Fonda Theater in Hollywood. After making its way through the rest of California, the group will be back performing in Southern California at the House of Blues in Anaheim on Jan. 30.
Before heading out onto the road, Hoying — still very much a Trojan — had an opportunity to return to USC and perform at USC Program Board’s Variety Hour last week.
As Pentatonix wowed the audience with a brief set, Hoying got the chance to reflect on where it all began for him.
“It’s so cool to come back and have all my friends at USC come support us and talk about memories,” Hoying said. “It means so much to know they are still supporting me, even though I don’t go to the school anymore.
Hoying and Pentatonix now have the world as their oyster, but Hoying said as he and his group continue to push the boundaries of a cappella music, he will never forget his Trojan family — a family who introduced him to a cappella and to opportunities that would change his life.
Great article. The world is very lucky to have been given the opportunity to enjoy and appreciate Scott’s incredible talent as well as pentatonix as a whole!!!

The use of banned performance-enhancing drugs in sports, commonly referred to as doping, is slowly but surely ruining the professional sports world.
Daniel Razzano | Daily Trojan
Most notably, Lance Armstrong, once seven-time Tour de France champion, finally confessed to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey after years of speculation. He was stripped of all his titles on Oct. 22, 2012.
Moreover, no eligible candidates were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame this year — voters were skeptical with regard to the outstanding performances of steroid-tainted stars such as Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa and Roger Clemens.
In fact, this was only the second time in four decades that no players were given the honor of being elected into the prestigious hall, which is quickly going from the Hall of Fame to the hall of shame.
In this era of performance-enhancing drugs within professional sports, one could say that everyone is guilty. Some players used PEDs while others did nothing to stop the widespread use among their peers. This burden comes with a price, as outstanding performances in any professional sport are now being questioned and records such as Bonds’ all-time home run record have asterisks next to them.
It seems as if it was just yesterday when Ben Johnson’s gold medal was stripped in the 1988 Seoul Olympics for using steroids. Even though many international sports organizations, led by the International Olympic Committee, continue to implement harsh penalties and rules against the use of PEDs, the sporting world continues to see high-profile athletes on the front-page news across the globe for doping.
So if everyone is using PEDs and it’s a natural development in the game, then why don’t all the professional sports leagues and their governing, anti-doping agencies just go ahead and allow them?
Plain and simple: It’s cheating.
As students, we aren’t allowed to cheat and if we do, there are consequences. What these athletes need to understand is that there are consequences and negative repercussions for their actions, not only personally but for the entire sporting world.
The consequences include, but are not limited to, expulsions, suspensions, fines, health problems and — not to forget — setting a bad example for children and teenagers who look up to these athletes.
A study published November 2012 in the journal Pediatrics reported that nearly 6 percent of middle school and high school girls and boys in the U.S have taken a steroid or growth hormone, which is quickly turning this issue from a sporting problem to a public health issue.
With all of these athletes using PEDs, we can’t tell who is and isn’t using. Even when athletes deny using them, like Armstrong did for so many years, we don’t know who is telling the truth. There are now many cases of athletes like Clemens and Bonds being called to testify in front of the grand jury and being charged with perjury for lying about their use of PEDs.
These days, when one sees a baseball player such as Josh Hamilton hit three home runs in a game or a football player such as Adrian Peterson rush for 2,000 yards in a season, they do not think as much about the player’s amazing athletic performance, but more about whether or not that player is performing so well because of an increased use of PEDs.
Question marks and asterisks are never good in sports since they will always leave the game in doubt. However, their increased presence in the results of games and record books plagues the sporting world today. With more and more players using PEDs, the game will never end — that’s just the truth.
 
Darian Nourian is a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism. 
I think the prevalence of such cheating may ultimately be the ruin of professional spectator sports.
Professional sports of all stripes should create separate leagues; one free of performance enhancing drugs, and one where there are little or no restrictions. Players can choose which one they wish to compete in. Fans can choose which ones they find more enjoyable to watch. Championship games can be organized that pit the two (maybe with some sort of handicap for the non-doped competitors).
Problem solved.
ANTI-DOPING, DRIVING, AND A BOX OF CHOCOLATES
Life is like a box of chocolates. And doping in sport is like driving on the roads.
To drive on the roads, drivers need to first learn the basics of operating their vehicle. And although every driver start from that common first step, how different drivers drive, what they drive in, where they drive to, and why they continue to drive varies.
While majority of drivers will only ever drive locally, use a basic vehicle, and drive for practical reasons of getting to a destination, there will be a talented few that constantly practice their driving skills, upgrade to the latest and greatest specification for their vehicle, and compete with other drivers locally and internationally.
Now in order for different drivers to compete, there must be some universally agreed rules. For example, all driver must agree that they will drive from point A to B to C, and not C to B to A. The problem comes when trying to agree on other competition rules.
Now driving has been around for a long time. But as vehicle technology continue to improve, it enabled drivers with modified vehicles to drive faster and faster. This made driving exciting and the blossoming group of spectators that enjoyed watching the driving races.
As technology improved, it meant that vehicles became cheaper. Driving was thus no longer restricted to the rich as cheaper vehicles became available. Everyone wanted a say in what driving is about, or ideally should be.
Now because new technology for vehicle modification progressed far quicker than drivers’ and manufacturers’ understanding of the risk of new devices, some vehicles began to overheat during races and some even gave rise to spectacular explosions during competition. Well the sight of an exploding high powered vehicle understandably caused a certain amount of distress to some drivers, to many spectators, to the road owners, and also to race organisors. Although everyone intuitively knew that was part of the game and implicitly accepted this risk through complicity.
Finally there came a time when a series of cars exploded during competition, and a public uproar ensued. So road owners and race organisors began instituting more competition rules. As a result of the new rules, in order for drivers to continue racing on those roads, they had to follow all the rules. Regardless if they personally agreed with it or not. They were never really consulted about it.
Now initially the new rules were not all bad, in fact the foundations were very well intended. To protect drivers, the new speed rules were designed to prevent drivers’ vehicles from over heating and exploding. Since high speed was the main cause of over heating, the rule makers thought that the best way to protect drivers was by putting speed limits for the races. The reasoning was that the spirit of racing was such that it was the journey of how drivers get to the finish line that was important and not what speed they got there in.
To police the speed limit, organisors, on prompting by road owners, begin putting up expensive speed cameras at various points in the race route. Because these speed cameras, many organisors could not afford it. So it was mainly in the big races that had it.
Unfortunately, the rule makers also did not really think through the whole process on how their rules will work in real life. For example, even though most drivers knew that there was a speed limit, many did not know what that limit was. Also the speed limit also changed depending on which part of the race route they were on. Unfortunately, because there were not many speed limit sign posts along the route, or because some driver consciously ignored the few sign posts that were present, many drivers began to travel as high a speed as they feel comfortable with (and confident that their vehicle will not overheat), or trustingly followed the lead of other (more seasoned) drivers on the assumption that the old guns always knew what the speed limit is suppose to be.
So now that the rules were there, many resumed enjoying the fast races between speed cameras. But not everyone was happy. A few indignant evangelists even began lobbying for more random mobile speed cameras to catch speeding drivers unawares. But when that measured also failed to control drivers speeding whenever possible, a new idea began to developed. This new idea was to institute a passport system to measure average speed of drivers. Under this new passport system, the time a driver crosses point A and point B is recorded. Their average speed can then calculated based on the time taken to travel between point A and B. Because this new passport system is new, no one knows if it will work. In any case, some drivers are unhappy with the costs and inconvenience of purchasing a new device to install in their vehicle for the passport system to work.
Now, the organisors did not just stop with speed policing. Besides the original issue of overheating, many organisors were also concerned about protecting the image of their sport and on how competing vehicles looked like. Because of this, new rules were also enacted that cherry picked what vehicle modifications were legal and what were illegal. These modification rules were, unfortunately, not necessarily based on issues of overheating or even about speed. For example, some modifications were allowed if they were manufactured from a well known factory from country A, while there was a blanket ban on all backyard/non-factory modifications. While this would obviously make sense from a quality control and image perspective, it had nothing to do with overheating or with speed itself. This was because factory parts from “reputable” countries were not necessarily safe, and backyard parts were similarly not necessarily unsafe.
And so many who loved the driving competition began to complain. Some support the idea or removing all speed and modification rules and contend that speed and modifications are what made driving competition exciting and is the true spirit of racing. But others argue that removing speed rules in driving races would encourage younger non competiting road users to speed on non competition roads.
Advocate for race rules also argue that modification rules (and not speed rules per se) protect competiting drivers by preventing exploding vehicles. Others highlight the fact that modification rules do not necessarily address overheating issues,and the focus should be to allow all modifications to be legal but involve engineers and other professinals so that high speed driving can be monitored and done safely. By shifting the focus from speed and modification control to overheating control, they argue, could also allow new technologies on engine cooling to develop. This would be useful for all drivers, and not just competing drivers.
And so the debate rages on and nobody knows what chocolate they will get the next time they pick one out from the box.

In response to security measures
Dear USC community,
The purpose of this letter is to oppose recent actions taken by the Office of the President:
1. Installation of fencing on north perimeter of University Park Campus
2. Failure to promptly notify the USC community of temporary fencing
3. Creation of after-hours access periods from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. restricting campus to
students, faculty and staff
4. Increases in the number of Department of Public Safety officers and yellow jacket ambassadors
5. Ban on pre-rush social events on Fraternity and Sorority Row
First, newly erected chain-link fences negatively impact the university. The temporary fencing is ugly. Permanent fencing would be even uglier. Fellow students use the term “prison” to describe the barriers along Jefferson Boulevard and Trousdale Parkway. Prospective students and parents touring campus will be distressed by the six-foot-tall metal gating and conclude USC is unsafe — a false notion we have fought hard to combat. Spiked posts and brick pillars already border the west, south and east sides of UPC. Now, the Nikias administration has constructed, both physically and symbolically, another wall between campus and community.
Second, the construction of fencing was carried out without timely notice. Following the Halloween shooting on campus, President C. L. Max Nikias announced measures on Nov. 6, 2012 to promote campus safety. However, installation of “temporary fencing” wasn’t declared until Dec. 21, when students were on winter recess and buildings were closed. Within a week, the fence was up and returning students were shocked to find campus enclosed in a gate. There was no opportunity for the USC community to veto or even comment on the installation of fencing.
Third, restriction of campus access from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. to students, faculty and staff is concerning. For starters, alumni must be allowed after-hours access. Additionally, if the university wants “a campus that welcomes all our neighbors for recreation, entertainment, education, and the community programs,” it will re-open campus to all seeking to use USC facilities for the betterment of society.
Fourth, I would like to formally oppose the addition of DPS officers and yellow jacket guards to the already bloated security system. DPS response time is impressive; increasing the number of officers is excessive. Furthermore, the multiplication of safety personnel creates a constant stifling state of observance in and around UPC. As a university we should not sacrifice freedom of movement for relatively little or no added security.
Fifth, the university’s ban on pre-rush Greek social events is troubling. Social outlets are important to a holistic college experience and the cancellation of these events in the guise of safety and finance is hollow. The construction of the north perimeter fencing undoubtedly cost much more than added security during the Wednesday and Thursday during which pre-rush has historically taken place.
As a student I am a primary stakeholder in the university. It is disturbing to watch important decisions in our university made by the Office of the President without timely notification or student input. I encourage the university to reopen campus to all people 24 hours a day, decrease its police state atmosphere and restore a social environment that promotes safety. President Nikias, tear down this wall!
Nick Brown
Senior, political science
You know it is obviously only a matter of time before check-point Charlie moves north of Jefferson into the demilitarized zone that is the UV.   SC’s billion dollar project can’t be left out of our fearless leader master plan.
Give it a rest. No one cares. If you’re so jaded, then move elsewhere.
She is right!   I have seen with my own eyes Dr. Speer’s new model of the glorious new capitol of USC!  The campus crosses over Jefferson at Hoover to McClintock connecting the UV property (renamed “North Conquest”) creating a new wide open venue for marching and rallies in honor of our glorious leader and his many accomplishments.  Through traffic on Jefferson will be diverted into subterranean tunnels where the salt mines once flourished under previous less glorious leaders as our current.
Well this conversation has certainly gotten unnecessarily out of hand, and certainly not befitting of members of the Trojan family who, in theory, all love this University and want it to shine for years to come.
I don’t think it’s necessary to question the motives of President Nikias or the administration, in order to disagree with recent decisions.  Nikias, a protoge of Sample, clearly loves all that USC stands for, including the decades-long effort to overcome the negative impact that (rightly or wrongly) is brought upon the University because of its location.  I truly believe that the fencing, check-points and increased security presence are well-intentioned… but I also question the unintended consequence and negative impact that they pose.
Undeniably, the worst on the list is the fencing.  It must go.  It’s a terrible idea, and a total knee-jerk reaction to the unfortuante events last Halloween.  I agree with the reader who suggests that if fencing must be added… it must be constructed with some sense of design (perhaps a mid-height brick wall, with ivy growth, etc).  The temporary fencing is hideous, and reinforces the notion that USC is in an unsafe and undesirable neighborhood.  This point can not be overstated.  There’s no denying it, and saying so is not an unreasoned insult to the people who live in the area.  Lest anyone forget, USC was founded there in the late 1800’s, when little else was around.  Soon, the area was filled with large homes and affluent residents.   As the years went by and the money moved  west, the neighborhoods around USC became home to large numbers of poor immigrants, and crime.  It is very fair to say that the neighborhood has let USC down… Not the reverse!  Nevertheless, USC remains statistically a very safe university, largely because of its well-recognized community outreach programs.  USC must continue this relationship with the community.
People must also be aware that USC is indeed private property.  This point is often forgotten because it functions much as a suburban shopping mall, with the public wandering freely about.  This is called an “easement”, and owners of private property have the right to revoke an easement at any time.   The same is true of a shopping mall which, by day, allows the public free and unobstructed access… but, shuts down at night.  Though USC has the right to shut its campus down at any time, I truly hope the administration can find a compromise that does not reinforce the belief that it is an unsafe university.
I find it funny that, lost in this entire discussion, is any attempt to take an obvious stab at UCLA which was recently listed by one publication as the most unsafe university campus in the country.  (That publication later revised its findings after the Bruins and others cried foul.)  I like to joke that UCLA is a great university BECAUSE of its neighborhood, and USC is a great university DESPITE its neighborhood.  Westwood makes them proud, and Expo Park keeps us humble.
Joking aside, USC has an obligation to protect its students, staff and guests, but I am very disappointed in recent decisions made toward that effort.  I hope and trust that the administration, on advice and counsel from the entire Trojan community, can revise its current efforts, and find effective but appropriate solutions.
To “Another USC parent”
Your inability to comprehend simple arguments leads me to believe you are an idiot that got lucky with a smart kid who got in to USC, whom you are now trying to protect because your only impression of college is of the state school you went to.
If you’d like to learn how to have an intelligent conversation I’d be glad to give you some pointers, although it may be too late for you to learn logic.
You’re attitude is destroying this country,
Pat
Thanks Pat,
Your comment speaks for itself and does surprise me if you are indeed a student of this fine university. 
It does seem there are some vestiges of the USC glory days as a “party school”, but the pendulum has more than shifted to a university which attracts and serves high performing socially sophisticated students.  
I do see how this metamorphosis can produce anxiety and unease for some, but well meets the needs of the “new majority” and goals of USC’s administration which I heartily endorse.
You’ve never actually attended this school or visited in the proper circles, have you?
Manny,
I have not attended USC as a student. I hold a doctorate from another university. I have visited USC many times. I have no idea what you are referring to as the “proper circles”.
I think it is a straw argument to say that the heightened security somehow affects USC’s relationship with “the community” as we’ve chosen to call them, whoever “they” are. The good people living in the neighborhoods around USC do not pose a threat to students or to the campus. The threat of crime comes from thieves in other parts of LA. USC is in a very high traffic area, and crime comes to us.
Having fences won’t change our relationship with the community. Having fences will protect our students and our private property. There is no legitimate reason for any person not affiliated with USC to enter campus between 9pm and 6am on a whim with no invitation.
The one thing this debate has taught us is that it is much easier to complain and disparage university decisions than to offer positive suggestions. You know what WOULD improve our relationship with the community? I’ll give you a hint- it has nothing to do with fences. If all of the people ranting against fences went and joined JEP, or Readers Plus, or a service fraternity or organization, then USC students could actually have a positive difference for the people living in this area.
Briefly, to follow up on Mr. Brown’s other points, I do agree that the temporary fencing is ugly. Efforts should be made as speedily as possible to replace it with tasteful permanent fencing such as can be seen along Exposition Blvd. Right now it looks like we’ve become a used car lot!
I also think the ID checking at the gates could be made easier for students, and the large number of CSC personal hired along the perimeter of campus is somewhat excessive, especially since they do little other than act as some small deterrent. And pre-rush should not have been banned, it is a USC tradition and should be allowed to continue.
For the record, campus is still accessible 24 hours a day – you just have to have a reason to be here. Any student or employee can arrange for any guests to come at any time of the day or night. I don’t think any alumni who want to visit campus after 9pm will have much trouble getting in. As for the “community” – well, they can come back in the morning. It is, after all, private property, and like any private property owners, we have the right to shut down for the night for safety and security.
Thank you!
Agreed, especially in regards to the pre rush ban an general crackdown on social events. USC has long been a work hard, play hard environment and Nikias is obliterating the culture that made USC great. 
The administration dismissively and half-heartrdly explains that these measures are in the name of safety. Yet if they were truly concerned about students safety they would actually educate them about partying responsibly, in a manner that the students would take seriously (lol @ alcohol edu). The university is treating undergrads like a high school would, and as such is crippling their ability to mature. If things dint change, Nikias is going to graduate a generation of students who have been part of protectionist instututioms they’re whole life.
perhaps the most concerning part is that the administration pays ZERO attention to one of the primary stake holders in any university: the undergrads paying $60,000/year to study there. They simply make decisions to please trustees, and to gain national attention e.g. Hiring professors that can’t teach worth a damn but have published research that Nikias can brag about.
Bottom line: everything being done in USC’s executive offices right now is aimed at lining the university’s pockets, and recruiting top classes over the next 15 years, so in 20 years USC wil be a “top school.” Thing is, top schools didn’t get they’re by copying other institutions and ignoring their undergrads, they fostered growth, took risks on them, and allowed them to, god f***ing forbid, make mistakes and learn from them.
In other words, in the eyes of the Nikias administration we’re just a transition class from party school to elite university, and he is doing everything in his power to eliminate any aspect of what he sees as “old SC,” the social, outgoing part.
Pat,
Goodbye and good riddance to the University of Spoiled Children and its Animal House vestiges. Welcome bright, sophisticated, high-performing undergrads who can appreciate the excellent university USC has become. 
Nikias is to be applauded for working to offer a social environment befitting the majority of its very capable current students and a world class university.
Yet another clueless parent…
Times are a changin Manny. As Pat recognized above, USC is completing “a transition from a party school to elite university”.
Yes, because everything about USC screams party school. And no one around here takes education seriously. What hole did you crawl out of? UCLA?
Someone watches a few too many movies. Either that, or your child is a shut-in.
Manny, don’t bother dignifying this individual’s words with a response. He/she hasn’t a clue about what goes on here. Just because he/she might be an adult doesn’t make him/her mature. Especially if it’s a parent trashing a university/students in a student-run newspaper. Just plain sad.
@ SCmom2013,
I am now quite sure your son is not in top house and definitely not a fraternity brother of my son or you would be better informed.  Ms. Saul and Mr. Carlos are sweet people but truly out of touch as to what goes on the row.  So if you are getting your information from them, you need a better source.
My son and I will pray for you and your son.
Judy
@ Other Parent,
Not all young men on the Row are alcohol crazed ruffians who need to be controlled.  My son who is a member of the top fraternity on campus does not drink or use any drugs.  He is a devoted Christian who holds weekly bible meetings in his fraternity for the benefit of other members.   So before you make broad generalizations about young men in the Greek system, you should really bother to educate yourself about what really goes on!
I doubt your son is in a top fraternity, considering my son is and has no recollection of your bible meetings.  In fact I have not heard of any bible meetings at any top houses.  I speak to Greek Life almost once a week.  Ask Beth or Ray if you need more info.  And we have no record of one of our top fraternities having a bible meeting group.  Believe me I would know.  More likely, your son is in a middle tier fraternity.  Nothing wrong with middle tier — its just not top.
Clearly someone (SCMom2013) hasn’t left college yet. Debating “top” fraternities is like arguing “my dad can beat up your dad.” Pathetic.
To Wes – Im not debating.  My son is in The Top Fraternity at USC.  It’s not debate when its the truth.
If only you had something more important and less superficial in your life, SCMom2013. This is a sad sight to see. Enjoy your opinions, I guess.
Wes is clearly a GDI.   I’m sorry rush didn’t work out for you.  Not everyone is Greek material.
God Bless!
And I’m sorry your son has to pay for friends and wastes time doing inconsequential things. I did rush. I did get a bid. I realized that a) my time was better spent elsewhere, b) I’m far too talented to hang out with people who will just drag me down with their stupidity, and c) I don’t need to pay (or like most there, have their parents pay – I’m sure you can relate) for great friends. I’ve already sold my own startup in college and have received 17 job offers coming out of college. “Greek material” is just inferior. So enjoy your delusions of your son somehow being of consequence in or out of college. ;-)
I don’t know either of you, but who cares one way or the other? Good for both of you. I didn’t do the Greek stuff, since I knew I didn’t want to. Some of my friends did, some didn’t. For me, the Greek system wasn’t “Jeff material”. The smugness here is disgusting and pathetic.
Swap emails/Facebooks and take it elsewhere, where it isn’t anonymous. Right now, this is pure cowardice. It’s even sadder that it’s an adult mother and a current student on a college newspaper site. Both of you should know better. Keep the conversation on track.
17 job offers, impressive!   It must be difficult to choose with so many Starbucks locations on the Westside.   I’ll be sure drop a little extra tip in the cup when you make my latte someday…
I’m actually starting as an assistant manager.   I will be getting stock options so I don’t need your spare change.
It’s funny you’re so arrogant when I’m already in the 1% due to a single sale of my startup, and I’m only 21! Enjoy your vicarious reliving of college through your son, who likely will never reach my current level. While you dabble in what you think is elite, I’ll be doing far more important things.
Christian fraternities are NOT top fraternities. Sorry I’m not sorry.
@ Pike #?
Last time I looked, there is no Pike House at USC.   I have been up and down the row including Portland and University streets.   Pike is no where to be found.  Are you a recongized USC fraternity?   If so, how come you don’t have a house?   I can’t imagine anyone ranks Pike #1 when they don’t even have a house.
My son is not in a Christian fraternity.   He is a member of the top social fratenity and maintains his Christian morals.
Regardless, we will pray that Pike finds a home someday!
@ Wes,
All the money and success mean nothing in the eyes of the Lord.   Your fallacious boasts are likley as hollow as your soul.  We will pray that you find true meaninig in your apparent rudderless vacuous life.
God Bless you Wes and we wish you the best!
And yes, we forgive you…
1.  Install permanent metal fencing.  The temporary chain link fencing looks trashy.
2.  Excellent.  Keep out the hood.
3.  How difficult is it to differentiate South Central locals from students and USC faculty and staff?  If they look like they might rob a convenience store, chances are they do not attend USC.
4.  The more hired guns, the better.  That being said, one/two guards at each entrance would probably suffice.
5.  The university’s argument that pre-rush security is too expensive is just another thinly veiled attack on Greek life.
Bottom line, South Central is a jungle and USC is private property.  Let’s see how many people champion diversity when they have a pistol shoved in their face.

President Barack Obama’s inaugural address Monday was unsurprisingly eloquent and touched on the ideas and promises of past leaders for motivation in moving forward in his final term. The address, which appropriately fell on Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday, included exhortations for furthering freedom and equality at home and abroad. The president also cited the Declaration of Independence when he discussed the importance of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
However, the president must do more to advance liberty and must not give in to the temptation to increase government power if our nation is to truly move forward without compromising its ideals.
Obama’s first term was a relatively successful one. He oversaw the withdrawal of the last troops from Iraq and arguably helped prevent a worldwide economic breakdown, in addition to repealing the military’s discriminatory Don’t Ask Don’t Tell policy. Despite these successes, the role of government in individual affairs only expanded while liberty receded. Obama’s inaugural address reinforced that this will only continue in the next term.
A majority of the initiatives Obama took in his first term are clear examples of government expansion and a reduction of individual choice and liberty. The president’s Affordable Care Act, likely the landmark legislation of his presidency, moved the United States closer to a system of government-run health care than ever before.
In keeping with the theme of strong social welfare programs, Obama mentioned by name Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security in his inaugural address, saying that they are “commitments we make to each other” and that they “do not sap our initiative, they strengthen us.” What he failed to mention was the insolvency of such programs and the very real possibility that the system of social “security” we are investing in today likely will be high and dry by the time we collect our checks as retirees.
It is time for the president and the entire nation to recognize that the solution to our problems is not more government but less. Instead of forcing individuals to allocate their wealth into channels predetermined and controlled by the government, the government — led by the president — must encourage investment in the free market and individual responsibility for finances.
In addition to the expansion of government through such means as Obamacare, the president arguably abused executive power beyond its parameters in more than one notable instance during his first term. In the high-profile “Fast and Furious” scandal involving the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the president exercised executive privilege in response to the House Oversight Committee’s requests for documents pertaining to the case.
If the president was willing to so publicly demonstrate wide executive powers in his first term for the purpose of avoiding inter-branch oversight, the fact that he does not face re-election at the end of the next four years indicates that this would only continue.
Most frighteningly, civil liberties as outlined in the Constitution have only been more restricted in the name of national security. The National Defense Authorization Act gives the executive branch the power to indefinitely detain individuals suspected of terrorism without due process of law, which constitutes a serious blow to individual citizens’ constitutional provisions for resisting overly extensive government power.
The issues that were not emphasized in the inaugural address are the most damning for the president: the crippling national debt and curbing of civil liberties. It is these issues that must be addressed in the upcoming term if the United States is to come out of the fiscal and ideological free fall it has been experiencing for the past number of years.
However, the strongly partisan and “progressive” agenda outlined by the president in his address does not indicate that these issues will be a priority in his second term.
None of this is to say that presidents that came before Obama were any better. In fact, his immediate predecessor President George W. Bush was disastrous in his expansion of government power, deepening of the national debt and abridgement of civil liberties with the constitutionally questionable USA PATRIOT Act.
The failures of former presidents are not justification for Obama to expand upon them, though. If anything, it should inform the president in reversing the damaging effects of these failures for the sake of our nation’s preservation.
Given the tone and content of the president’s second inaugural ceremony, though, the best we can hope for is that things do not get even worse. Significant improvement in the most crucial areas will likely have to wait for four more years.

Over winter break, there were many changes at USC. Security measures were drastically altered; a new health center was opened next to the Lyon Center; new professors were added to the faculty, and more. Though less monumental in scale, smaller changes have not gone unnoticed. Everybody’s Kitchen, better known simply as EVK to those with meal plans, has taken up a few new procedures that make the student dining experience a bit more pleasant.
Perhaps the most noticeable change is the addition of music to the dining hall. In the late afternoons and evenings, EVK now plays music over the PA system. Though this may seem like an insignificant addition, the presence of music has transformed the atmosphere at EVK. Now, groups of diners always have something from which to base a conversation, and those sitting alone have music to accompany their thoughts.
The food, however, is the most significant improvement. Since winter break, many new menu items have been introduced, replacing old dishes. For example, the sandwich line has received a makeover. Previously, one would have to dictate to a kitchen employee what he or she wanted on a sandwich and then wait while it is arranged. But now, after a few experiential attempts last semester, the make-it-yourself style sandwich line seems like it is here to stay. The Grill also offers different dinner themes than were previously available. These simple changes to the menu break the monotony of eating at the same dining hall every day.
It also seems that the kitchen staff are experimenting with a newfound sense of humor. This Monday, the sign above a dish of ribs (which normally would have read “Ribs”) instead read, “EVKitty,” which, for those not associated with the dining hall, is the endearing name of the cat that hangs around the outdoor patio. Not to worry, though – EVKitty can still be found out back begging for scraps.
