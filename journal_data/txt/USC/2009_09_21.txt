The USC men’s golf team tied for eighth amid a strong field at its inaugural tournament of the season, the Olympia Fields Invitational in Chicago. The Trojans shot 43-over 883 (295-290-298) for the weekend.
USC coach Chris Zambri wasn’t thrilled with the result but saw things the team could build on.

“I’m disappointed and I know every one of them was too,” Zambri said. “I’m disappointed in our finish, but I saw a lot of good things out there from guys.”
Seven of the top 10 teams in the country took part in the event, including Stanford and tournament victor Arizona State. The No. 5 Sun Devils seized the lead after the second round and held on for the victory, shooting 30-over 870. Stanford finished fourth, six shots behind the pace.
USC was in fifth place at 25-over through the first two rounds but struggled down the stretch, shooting 18-over on Sunday. The Trojans were tied for ninth after the first round of action.
Zambri said he thought the team was a little off throughout the weekend despite playing well at times.
“There’s a huge difference between seeing some good signs and putting up a good round,” he said.
Still, Zambri doesn’t think his team is far from putting up good rounds and being a consistent threat to win tournaments.
“I don’t think there are many teams out there that if we play really well we can’t go out and win the tournament,” he said. “We just need to improve enough so that we don’t have to play perfectly to win. We want to be able to play just okay to win.”
Junior Matthew Giles paced USC with a 6-over 216 (74-67-75). He shot toward the top of the leaderboard Saturday after posting a 3-under 67 but faltered late and finished 10th. Giles entered the final day of play in fifth place.
His second round 67 was the best individual round of the tournament.
“His game looks pretty good,” Zambri said. “He was real rusty from having a wrist injury, so he needs to just knock off the rust and chip and putt a little better.”
Zambri was also pleased with how his trio of freshmen performed in their college debuts. Martin Trainer tied for 19th at 10-over 220 (73-72-75). T.J. Vogel tied for 33rd at 13-over 223 (74-74-75) and Sam Smith tied for 45th at 17-over 227 (74-77-76).
“I was happy to see Martin Trainer play OK in his first college tournament,” Zambri said. “I was happy to see Sam Smith play a good nine every day … T.J. Vogel played OK.  His score counted for us every day.”
Sophomore Steve Lim rounded out the USC group. He tied for 52nd at 19-over 229 (77-79-73).
Most of the team struggled in the final round, although Zambri attributed that more to coincidence than nerves or fatigue.
“One of your rounds has to be your worst,” he said. “It was a tough golf course and we really didn’t play as well as I know we can.”
Giles, Trainer and Vogel all had their worst round of the weekend on Sunday. Only Lim posted his best score of the tournament on the final day.
Zambri and assistant coach Josh Brewer sat down with each player after the tournament and told them where they needed to improve.
“Some of them it was more physical and some of them it was a little more mental,” he said. “If they improve, they’re really talented and we have a chance to be one of the better teams.”
The Trojans will get their first chance to prove him right this weekend at The Fall Preview in Bremerton, Wash.

Shocked after a loss to No. 4 UCLA in the semifinals, the USC men’s water polo team left the NorCal Tournament without a championship for the first time since 2005.
But the Trojans rebounded with a win over No. 3 California in their next match to leave on a high note.

Playing with a loss on their conscience, something the Trojans (8-1) had not felt since they fell in the 2007 NCAA Championship, the Trojans stepped up to the pool to face off against the scrappy Golden Bears and showed a resiliency not seen for some time.
Opening the third-place game against the Golden Bears, USC struggled from the outset. Both teams were coming off semifinal losses, and defenses especially struggled in the first quarter. A high-scoring opening eight minutes ended in a 3-3 tie.
But the Trojans soon showed why they were ranked a unanimous No. 1 in the preseason poll — and why their defense was the best in the nation last season.
USC allowed just one goal in each of the next three quarters, shutting down the Golden Bear offense while spreading their own offense around. USC finished with eight goals from eight different scorers.
Senior two-meter Jordan Thompson was among them. He was also one of the Trojan seniors who had not lost at the NorCal Tournament in his entire career.
The 8-6 win helped Thompson and his teammates erase their frustrating semifinal loss.
“I was incredibly impressed and proud to be a part of a group of guys who rallied from that loss and came out fighting in the  second game,” Thompson said. “We didn’t have a choice to lose that game.”
The loss to UCLA came in especially heartbreaking fashion. The teams were tied heading into the fourth quarter after a defensive battle between the two rivals, and just three Trojans — senior two-meter Shea Buckner, senior driver J.W. Krumpholz and redshirt junior driver Kyle Sterling — had been able to score.
With the final seconds ticking away and the fourth quarter still scoreless, the game looked like it might head to overtime. But Bruins sophomore Cullen Hennessy fired what was just the 10th Bruins shot on goal, a testament to the strong defensive play of the Trojans. This one, though, found the back of the net, sending the Bruins to the NorCal championship game.
“There was a general lack of execution,” Thompson said of the loss.
USC’s struggles against UCLA were especially surprising given the results of the tournament’s first two games on Saturday, when the Trojans looked to once again claim the NorCal title as its own.
The Trojans opened the event against familiar foe Pomona-Pitzer, which USC had beaten to open the season 16-2 and immediately made a statement with their defense, holding the Sagehens to just one goal through the first three quarters. They eventually defeated the Division III opponent 13-3.
The victory in their opening round game set up a quarterfinal match with No. 8 UC Irvine.
USC’s defense let up just four goals to the Anteaters and two different Trojans, Buckner and senior driver Justin Rappel, each recorded hat tricks as the Trojans came away with the 11-4 win.
Execution had not been a weak spot for the Trojans leading up to the tournament, and Thompson said the team can improve its execution moving forward.
“It’s something that we will definitely fix,” Thompson said.

F. Scott Fitzgerald ended The Great Gatsby with the metaphor of boats beating against the current, an image that has become so cliché it seems to have lost all meaning.
But it was hard not to think of the passage while watching USC flail against Washington on Saturday. And it wasn’t only the boats sailing on Lake Washington just outside of Husky Stadium that conjured up the image.
Unfamiliar ground · USC coach Pete Carroll is not often outcoached in football games, but that was clearly the case Saturday in the Trojans’ upset loss to Washington, columnist Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz writes. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
The Trojans’ struggles against a scrappy, mid-level Pac-10 team have become so institutionalized at USC that the annual event is almost a cliché in itself. Instead of being surprised by Saturday’s outcome, most Trojan fans felt like they were headed in a direction they had been before.
In fact, it’s a surprise there wasn’t a USC fan in the crowd who could have spoiled the ending for everyone based on past follies. A true fan might have stood up after USC’s tying drive and blurted out, “I’ve seen this one before — the other team kicks a field goal in the final seconds and the fans rush the field. I’m gonna head out and beat traffic.”
But this year was supposed to be different, right? USC coach Pete Carroll spent all week insisting the Trojans wouldn’t be caught off-guard again, that they had finally learned their lesson.
To the players’ credit, they certainly appeared up to the task. They made it look like they were on pace for another USC blowout with their first quarter performance.
“It wasn’t a question of being ready to play emotionally or anything,” Carroll said, drawing a contrast to past letdowns.
This wasn’t a matter of the Trojans falling behind and seeing their comeback cut short by time or one key play like in so many past losses.
It was simply a case of USC getting outcoached.
Carroll took ownership for the loss immediately afterward, despite most of his players showing maturity by placing the burden on themselves. But this mea culpa might mean the Trojans are in for more trouble.
With Carroll having more than enough scouting information at his disposal, there was no excuse for being unprepared for what the Huskies threw at the Trojans. USC coaches and players alike said after the game that there were “no surprises” in the game beyond their own mistakes, but maybe that’s a cause for concern.
The Trojans’ struggles to adapt down the stretch might have been understandable if Washington had beaten USC by employing some Boise State-like gadget plays.
But Washington could have broadcast its gameplan on the JumboTron and USC still might have been too fickle to adjust.
Carroll’s blunders are best exemplified by his handling of the quarterbacks throughout the week. Both he and quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates kept reporters guessing while they waited to see how Matt Barkley’s shoulder injury progressed. But with the bone bruise to the true freshman improving only incrementally over the week, sophomore Aaron Corp took all the first-team snaps and looked like he had seized temporary command of the position.
At some point, Carroll would have to invest himself in Corp and show him that the team was committed to rallying around him as a starter.
Or not.
Asked when the coaching staff told him he would be starting Saturday’s game, Corp said — with his head held low — that “they never really did.”
Corp would never say it, but the message came through louder than a bullhorn: USC’s coaching staff never really showed faith in him.
The coaches’ attitude was evident in the play-calling. Corp was forced to be a dropback passer instead of using his trademark mobility. It’s possible the decision was due to the lingering effects of Corp’s preseason fractured fibula, but coaches insisted during the week that he was 100 percent recovered.
Their trepidation also showed on a third-down play from the Huskies’ 7-yard line when the Trojans elected to run the ball instead of taking a shot at the end zone. Ensuring the game-tying field goal may have entailed the lowest risk, but since when has Carroll made it a point to adhere to coaching conventions?
Corp was not at his best on Saturday, but quarterbacking should never be a pop quiz. Yet Corp is the one who unfairly faces being a potential pariah among students instead of Carroll.
If Carroll isn’t a fan of Fitzgerald, perhaps he can learn through literature by picking up a book by Malcolm Gladwell. The coach references Outliers when referring to Barkley, but he might want to take a look at The Tipping Point, which details how the tiniest factors can catalyze unforeseen and sometimes disastrous endings.
The book could re-emphasize the point that if the Trojans can’t get back to their normal standard of play, they will find themselves falling short of another Pac-10 championship. Then the only thing at stake will be an at-large BCS bid. Or the Holiday Bowl. Or the Sun Bowl.
And if English isn’t Carroll’s pleasure, maybe a spelling lesson will do. Right now, there’s no “SC” in the word “finish,” despite what those T-shirts may say.
But finishing strong might be the only way for Carroll to right his ship.

Krishna, I was foolish enough to entertain your attempt to steer the conversation away from sports and over to academics, where you could depend upon your trusty arsenal of well-rehearsed cheap shots. But that wasn’t the conversation we were having, was it? Such an action is typical of a whiny Pac-10 fan who really doesn’t know how to do much more than scream “Fight On” after USC blows out yet another high school team. It kind of reminds me of the LSU/Tulane games. Tulane always gets blown out, and the sour student section starts chanting “Safety School” over and over again. And your comment on Vandy’s football team? No, they’re not terribly respected. But perhaps that would change if they only played one ranked team each year. Such is not the case in the SEC.
I find it funny that you’re willing to discuss wit when your best argument yet–“You probably researched US News to expediently support your weak repartee”–is just a more sophisticated way of saying, “Nah uh, you’re stupid.” In addition, judged on your weakly founded, cop-out, “you’re just proving my point” response, I can only assume that affirmative action has played a significant part in your being accepted at a major university.
Beating on Pete Carroll, a coach who has brought 7 Pac-10 and three National championships, by some wanna be writer would have been funny had appeared in Daily Bruin.
Football teams lose a game or two here or there. That is part of the game. We put a whole lot of pressure and foist expectations from freshmen student athletes and then rag on them if they somehow don’t come up to our expectations.
Michael, I would take your inane column more seriously once you take the helm of a Division-1 football team. Until then please keep to writing about things that you have some idea about.
“SEC Fan”  you bristle when someone has to say something contrary to your view.  Typical of SEC football fans.  You issue some inane comment in hopes that you elicit a response from SC fan.  I took the bait.  Again you respond with petulant blathering.  You are not even offering up witty trash talk.  Please grow up.
As for academics, I don’t care about the endeavors of your matriculation.   I concede Vanderbilt has a better ranking academically than USC on US News Report for National schools.   My statement was made on the body of SEC schools.   When you admit to bouncing around for your Undergrad, I wonder if you are even a Vanderbilt Alum.  Your comment reeks of a convenient statement.  You probably researched US News to expediently support your weak repartee.  Anyways, outside of Vanderbilt what other SEC schools are even close academically?  On the whole, does Vanderbilt even have (ever had) a respectable football program?  In the end, you’re still here earning a degree from USC.  You proved no point.
I assume you’ll continue to run your childish mouth.  The fact is USC is a well balanced school across many sports as well as academics.  No SEC school compares.  You’re a football polemicist with no real factual support.  Besides, there’s no playoff system yet just the BCS that most everyone dislikes.
Lastly,  I didn’t come on hear to pick fight over which conference is better.  The gist of my observation is that the SEC fan base has some strange obsession with going out of their way to make comments about the PAC-10 and in particular USC.   You continue prove my point with your response.  I recommend you spend your energy on earning that degree and move on.  No one is going pay you for your opinion of USC football.
Pete Carroll isn’t perfect, but when you lose only 1 to 2 games a year consistently, you’re pretty close.  When a kid, whose entire life is no older than one of my suits, offers advice, second guesses, and generally calls out the man who single handily restored respect back to our football program, that’s disrespectful.
Pete Carroll has lived a thousand lives and overcame a thousand setbacks.  He won’t be bothered by this article no more than a tick on his arm, yet I wonder how all those whom he mentored feel about their life coach dismissed in such fashion.  I for one find it disgraceful.
“Their attacks are overwhelmingly based out of fear and jealousy (misspelled) of a great and storied program.”
Not at all. Believe me, there’s no jealousy and certainly no fear. Everyone outside the Los Angeles area seems to realize how overrated USC always is. If anything, I would love for USC to win out this year, and hopefully have a chance to win the national title–only to be massacred by Alabama, Florida or LSU. I want USC to schedule one of those teams (not Arkansas or Auburn) instead of these bullshit games against Ohio State and Notre Dame.
“Obviously, ‘SEC Fan’ sees the apparent advantage to attending USC as opposed to enrolling at an inferior SEC school to earn their degree.”
Actually, I’m at USC for my masters, and love the school (other than the sports fans). And the sports fans, to me, is a minute detail in the grand scheme of things when you’re choosing a college. But I attended several schools to get my undergrad… guess what one of them was? Vanderbilt! That’s right, an SEC school that is, in fact, superior to USC. Whoops! But I digress…
USC has proven time and time again that they cannot take advantage of the cushy schedules they are given. Give me a break–the only top 10 teams USC ever faces are Ohio State (who has been pummeled by SEC teams twice in the last three years) and California, and we all know that they never have a top 10 team. Ever. Bitch and moan all you want, but Les Miles, Nick Saban and Urban Meyer are laughing their asses off at all of you because you can’t capitalize on the silver platter than has been handed to you by the Lack-10.
Stop with the self-loathing if not petulance.  We had a chance to seize perfection for a few years now and failed.  How many teams in any sport achieve perfection?  The reality is football teams win and lose for a variety of reasons.  Pete Caroll has accomplished much in such a short amount of time.  He has restored the self-esteem to a program that was beleaguered for quite some time.
Amid the caucophony of criticism, I believe this is a rebuilding year.  However, it is apparent that Sanchez left a huge void.  Frustrations and questions now rise because it appears neither Corp or Mustain seem capable or prepared to take the helm while Barkley develops.  Further, the departure of Norm has left the offensive coordinator position lacking creativity and aggressiveness.  Our newest personnel addition seems even a far cry from filling Sarkisian shoes.  Lastly,  the tail back rotation appears impotent at the worst times.  What is so wrong with featuring just one bulldozing full-back and one explosive tail-back?  Against Washington, a casual observer would think we didn’t know how to run student-body right or an I-formation.
On a side note, it is rather funny how the SEC fans always find a way to post some blather about USC football in articles completely unrelated to them.     Their attacks are overwhelmingly based out of fear and jealosy of a great and storied program.  Obviously, “SEC Fan” sees the apparent advantage to attending USC as opposed to enrolling at an inferior SEC school to earn their degree.
Finally, let’s remember the lean times USC faced.  Just a decade ago, when a  perfect season seemed an impossibility let alone winning the PAC-10 title.  Things will change for the better.  They may even get worse before they get better.  Barkley may or may not be the future.  But I have faith that Pete Caroll will not abandon the winning tradition he has brought back to the Coliseum.
If the media would give USC the amount of credit it deserves, the Washington loss wouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. So why should it be called a letdown? I know I wasn’t surprised.
I’ll tell you who was responsible for this “letdown.”
It’s the media. Not Pete Carroll, and not Aaron Corp.
The media overhypes USC year after year. Everyone is convinced that USC is God’s bloody gift to football. USC is what it is; an above average team, but far from a superior force in football. Their conference games are hardly a challenge for anyone–seriously, Cal? UCLA? Oregon State? Give me a break. And their non conference games are jokes… Ohio State? Notre Dame? Please. I would pay big money to see this team play in the SEC West, and even bigger money to listen to all the Trojan fans cry when they go 7-5.
If you watched the game, you would know that AARON CORP was responsible for the latest letdown.
UNBELIEVABLE! Have any of these writers followed college football for the last 50 or more years. Teams lose and it is nothing new. USC has one loss to a team and they call for his resignation. I am a long time fan of USC and have been frustrated with the losses over the past few years, but they bounce back each year and end up in the Rose Bowl dominating their opponent. So take a break from whining and writing crap and see how USC responds and finishes out the season. FIGHT ON TROJANS!!!!
Great article!  Ignore the haters, you said what a heck of a lot of us are thinking.  EVERYONE saw the upset coming but still the Blowjans couldn’t get it done.  I don’t advocate Pete leaving, but he needs to get real again.
He’s starting to believe all of that “greatest coach in college football” stuff and not getting it done.  And PLEASE, people, stop talking about the NC game.  It’s gone.  Again.  Two or three more losses and the Toilet Bowl is in this team’s future.
I hate SC.  It is in my DNA to hate SC (and the band).  My father hated SC, his father hated SC and had my father’s father’s immigrant father been in this country at SC’s founding, he would have hated the Trojans, too.  That said, I wish the Seattle Times would hire Mr. Middlehurst-Schwartz.  He would be a refreshing set of eyes on the Northwest sports scene.
What people forget to realize is that the Pac-10 is all about cycles. People are quick to forget that Washington won a national title in the last 20 years. Stanford was dominant about 10 years ago. Oregon St., Arizona, etc, have all had their day in the sun. You can pick any team, say UCLA for instance. Within the next 10 or 20 years, they will be the dominant team. Same goes for Arizona. USC has had an amazing run and will probably be great for quite a while longer. That being said, we’ve seen dominant teams come and go and come back again. It’s all about cycles.
Wow, I don’t know what is more surprising: 1) that a Daily Trojan reporter wrote an honest article that shook and riled Trojans’ fans out of their daily reverie, or 2) that Trojans’ fans have much difficulty when it comes to properly writing and expressing their thoughts on this forum.
BS.  The word “turnover” doesn’t even appear in this wanne-be-Plaschke’s article.  It clearly wasn’t the coaching staff’s best game, but hold on to the damn football and we win going away.  It ain’t rocket science.
Wow! Considering the young guy that penned this disastrous article IS a Trojan, there’s no wonder we couldn’t pull through on Saturday. Lack of support! One loss people, against Sark and Holt. Let us not abandon ship. Carroll is a phenomenal coach, there is no other explanation for the lengthy list of accolades and accomplishments.  If you’re mad or disappointed that’s fine but really, you want him gone? And some of you are suggesting Willingham? Come on!  The seasons just begun, we have time to learn and adjust! The negativity is childish and the mark of a fair weather fan.  If that’s what you are, we don’t need you. And as for the author…best of luck, you’re going to need it. I sure wouldn’t want to be you, walking around campus after poorly trashing Carroll.  Maybe you’ll drop out or transfer. That’s what I’m hoping for. Either way, be a little more respectful when you pen to paper.
Win or lose, we Fight on!
I was at that game, and am a long-time Washington fan.  Let me assure you that USC was not “molasses-slow”.  Their team speed was clearly superior to Washington’s, especially along the DL, but almost everywhere.   McKnight said after the game that as a team USC has on average “clearly superior athletes”.  I agree with that.
USC lost because it turned the ball over, and its quarterback was not ready.  How much of that “not readiness” is the coaching staff’s fault I can’t really say.  But USC did not lose for lack of speed or intensity or athleticism.  Maybe 3-4 Washington starters, max, could start for USC.  It happens that one of them is Washington’s quarterback, and that position can be huge.
I left that game thinking that if those teams play on a neutral field 10 times, USC wins 8-9 times.  The Dawgs were fortunate to win, but almost as important as that win for the program was that they played with a ferocity that used to typify them, but that they hadn’t shown for many years.
Keep salting your beer with tears, Prophylactic phans.  A couple of national championships, yearly BCS bowls and an unprecedented seven straight PAC-10 championships have spoiled you like a school beached sardines. Yeah, and keep beating on Pete Carroll…run him out of town with pitchforks.  Then what?  I hear Ty Willingham is searching for a gig?  Perhaps Dennis Erickson is peeking under the fence for greener pastures?…he has been at AZ St. for a whole two years, hasn’t he?  Or take Rick the Dick up in Westwood?…..pleeeze! After all, I’m certain he’s probably run out of the card tricks and rabbit-filled hats he’s been using to entertain the fans of the Powder-Blue-Pretty-Boys.  Just keep clubbing on Pete. You’ll eventually wear him down and get what you want.
Oh, and next time you come up to visit us, bring a quarterback with you.
“Scrappy mid-level Pac 10 team?”  Please quit drinking the cardinal and gold kool aid!  USC was favored by three touchdowns and Washington had lost 15 straight.  If they are a midlevel team no wonder this conference has such a weak reputation.
It is amazing how many people know exactly what Pete Carroll should do. If Pete ever decides to leave there is 2 dozen future coaches here who know exactly how to turn it around. Wake up everyone it’s one thing to be a fan but some of these comments are outrageous.
Great.
Future sportswriters learn to be lazy hacks and parrot pre-conceived talking points in college.
Somewhere Bill Plashcke beams with pride.
And people who care about quality journalism shed a tear.
Well youre totally not an english major
Oh, please. Pete Carroll is the best coach in college football; he’s not a god. Let’s remember that Coach Carroll is responsible for a whole lot of wins and not whip up a lynch mob because of a few losses.
I believe that the Trojans would have beaten any other PAC10 team this past week; the Coach had found the answer to the “letdown” problem. But across the field was a guy named Sarkisian, and while he’s not yet the head coach that Pete Carroll is, he had a lot of advantages going into the game that no other conference coach would have, including the Cinderella storyline that his team’s winless record last year (under different management) gave him as a motivational tool. Did you see the Huskies bouncing up and down on their sideline during the game? That team was uniquely fired up, and their new coach has them playing well.
You want to swap Carroll for Sarkisian, though? Not if you’ve really been watching the Trojans with Pete Carroll coaching them.
Man oh man….who is being fickled. One loss and the SC dominance of football in the PAC-10, let alone Southern California, is over. The UCLA ad about the football monopoly being over has come true. Pete simple needs to quit. I am certain Willingham is available.
Reality is this is a rebuild year. Can you imagine a rebuild year with this much talent on it?  At the end of the day dominance will be re-established and it won’t be in Berkley or even across town.
Shouldn’t you be on holiday instead of writing this crap?
Pete don’t listen to all of these Madden video game junkies who have never played football or coached in their lives.  Everyone knows this is a rebuilding year.   I can assure that the National championship game will not be played by two undefeated teams…it will be an Undefeated Florida vs. a one loss team.  We can still do it.
FIGHT ON!!!
Unfortunately, the folks who make up the BCS voting block doesn’t recognize a 1 loss PAC10 team, even USC, though they do recognize a 1 loss team from the other conferences.  Could it be that those 1 loss teams won their conference championship, one which the PAc10 doesn’t have?  Hmmmmm……
What stings the most is when the various talking heads, and national sports media outlets LOUDLY proclaimed that this game would be a “trap game” after the hard-fought and emotional victory in Ohio, and yet the team STILL LOST to the Huskies. This loss caught NO ONE by surprise.
Trojan fans can only hope that Washington will go on to enjoy a winning season to validate that win or else USC can kiss any hope of appearing in the BCS title game goodbye.
The departure of Mark Sanchez surely played a significant role in the sputtering offense Trojan fans witnessed on Saturday, but can we now ALSO address the elephant in the room? USC has LOST composure and continuity on OFFENSE gradually over the years…AFTER Norm Chow was basically forced out of his job.
Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz references The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell. To extrapolate further beyond this one game, this one loss, the LOSS of Norm Chow set in motion a series of events which reverberate to this day.  Pete Carroll choosing to placate Kiffin and Sarkisian by choosing those two (rather than ‘risk’ losing them) over Coach Chow, has clearly HURT the offense. Would anyone care to argue this point?
The Best Offensive Coordinator in college football is now employed over in Westwood. USC has NOT won another BCS Title after Norm Chow left. This has now become a sadly historic FACT.
I, for one, miss Coach Chow’s innovative and brilliant play calling. He knew (and maximized) the strengths of his own players while constantly keeping the defense off-balance and uncomfortable. Compare and contrast this with the present state of the USC Trojans Offense. The Trojans NEED someone of Coach Chow’s caliber to run the offense. This is no place for pride or hubris. Think of The Team first and foremost.
Everyone knows this is Coach Carroll’s team. It’s a shame that Pete Carroll may have felt threatened that some of the glory was given to Norm Chow when Coach Chow was running the offense. For the overall good, the Trojans need someone of Coach Chow’s talent and abilities to run the offense. At minimum, we need continuity and stability on the offensive side of the ball.
Fight On!!!
Speaking of Chow and UCLA, the Bruins defense will completely stifle USC’s offense if Carroll and Bates don’t get their act in gear.  Obviously not a Bruin fan, but they smoked Tennessee and TN gave FL a good run this past weekend.  Heck, A beats B, B barely loses to C, therefore, A could’ve beaten C.  OUCH!
Michael–this is a well written article.  I was at ‘SC before Pete arrived and that was a forgettable era for alums/fans.  The loss against the Huskies this past weekend reminded me of those days.  This was not a black swan event, but given the difficult road games ahead, something really has to change.  At the end of the day, it’s up to the coaching staff to make the necessary adjustments and inspire the team to aspire.
I’m totally agree and it’s incredible with all the resources and the experience that USC was outcoached by the Huskies … I’ve heard a lot of things after the latest collapse and lot to blame: turn-overs, concentration, QB play, etc.. etc… and it’s time to turn the page … again, but this time the future for the trojans looks more interesting and difficult if they not turn a notch in coaching and the offense … with road games at California, at Notre Dame, at Oregon and a home game with Oregon State the task is huge for this team … and I’m sure if they  won those games, USC will be back on top with a big chance again for something special… the teams in front are very overrated, the SEC conference is overrated: Penn State. c’mon (Syracuse, Temple and other lousy team that I don’t remember): Texas: Wyoming, UTEP and Texas Tech: Boise State, mmm no, so figure out  so the reality is that we have just a couple of contenders:  Miami (the Hurricanes) and the Golden Bears of California. I start to follow USC when Pete Carroll started here, if I’m not mistaken it was 2001 and the record was 6-7 and a horrible lost in a bowl game against Utah … after that USC  has been in top of everything, USC is recognized again, USC is hated back East (just see Lou Holtz on ESPN) but the bottom line is that every single day since 2002, USC is on the news and on the National media and that my friends is a huge accomplish by Pete Carroll. He is the best coach in College Football no doubt about that. So yes it has been a tough weekend, but again USC holds the future in his Coaches, Players and all the people involved in the program … to re-direct the ship. Good Luck Trojans and Fght On!!!!!
No guts, no glory folks!
I’m mad as hell, and right now, if SC played Cal, Oregon, Oregon State, Stanford, Arizona or UCLA, they’ll be losers, as demonstrated by our horrific offense and play calling……  We cannot rely on “well, at least we’ll have the Rose Bowl this year”.  Come on folks, enough of taking a backseat to the BCS tiltle game oppty.  SC has enough Rose Bowl Championships to last a career.  I’m not satisfied with a Rose Bowl oppty/win, AND neither should you!!  Not when the SC Trojan football team has all that fantastic talent.
A fire needs to be burned under their butts right now; the energy level needs a strong kick in the pants.  Where was the famous SC jump on Saturday?  Where was the leadership, walking up and down the bench firing up these kids throughout the game?  It was nowhere to be seen, at least on TV, unless you saw Sarkisian doing it with his team.  That was SC’s emotional “giddy-yup” in Purple and Gold..
Everyone, alumni and students, must show up at the WSU game on Saturday evening and show our support for our team.  Really, folks, they have the oppty to demonstrate to the college football fan base and sports writers across the country that they are the best college football team in the country by executing an outstanding  set of wins over the remainder of the year.
Now, what about throwing the long ball?
Fight on, brothers and sisters.
wow, i know USC must never lose but alas even the mighty fall. i think Carroll should resign then USC could return to Ted Tollner or one of the other big winners.
Great writing.  As a 1957 grad I have seen it all. I love USC and always will. I have lived in Omaha, NE since 1968.  You want football fanatics try here.  I am a Big Red season ticket holder and when both lose as they did Saturday the result is downright depression.
Right the ship please Coach Carroll.  It is the greatest ship in the college football fleet.
So, USC’s ignorance has finally placed them in the 2009 Las Vegas Bowl.  Congratulations!!  I made my reservations after the LSU-Washington game.  I tried to warn everyone about USC’s fall from glory after the loss to Stanford but all I got was an email from USC’s secretarial staff trying to get this concerned alum fired from his job.
As with the 2008 season, USC’s no-offense offense rides high and mighty once again. Two touchdowns in two games – no shocker to this fan and alum.  The San Jose State game should not count unless you want to claim victory over a junior high school team – walk tall and proud on that one.  But let me tell you why USC will be 8-4 at best this season.
1)    The laid back, lack of focus, no intensity training of the USC football team.  When other conferences and teams make adjustments and beef up their training and practice, why should USC do the same?  The other teams have obviously adapted enough to beat USC’s conservative and redundant play calling.  You see all the opponents hyped up before the game with the intensity of Nick Holt’s face.  The USC football team looks like they are spending a day at the beach.  Why even show up to the game???
2)    Why watch your opponents’ game footage and compare each team’s off the line speed???  After seeing Washington play against LSU, the money was on Washington. And after seeing USC at Ohio State, I took out a third mortgage and placed it all on Washington – money line.   USC’s lack of speed is their downfall.  If you compare side by side, the speed of each team, you will see the lightning speed of other teams versus the molasses quickness of USC’s runningbacks and overall team speed.  If USC keeps this up, you might as well send all the upcoming seniors to the senior citizen’s home – they move just as fast.
3)    False sense of superiority.  Please do not read or listen to the media about USC’s dominance because it just isn’t there.  The hype is just that – all hype.  In the 2008 season USC was lucky to win the games against Cal and Arizona.  Cal won that game, but poor officiating called back a Cal touchdown giving USC the win.  USC’s no-offense offense barely scored two touchdowns against those teams and squeaked by with a win.  Some dominant team.  It is one thing to give your players encouragement, but to give them a false sense of encouragement leads to disappointment and a losing season. Be realistic.  Tell it like it is so they can work harder, faster and stronger. Without this, USC is looking at a 7 year Las Vegas Bowl run.
Listen, I could go on and point out everything that has gone wrong with the program and team, but I decided to touch on a couple of things so that you may open your eyes.  I come from a USC family – sister, brother in-law etc.  I have even convinced 20+ year season ticketholders to sell their tickets based on my factual argument.
You can take this critique and do with it as you wish.  If USC is a school who can not take input from their alumni then USC should change their slogan to     “At USC, where we get our alumni fired for criticizing our football team”.
Commentators should announce in the pregame show “we are set for another exciting game with USC’s no-offense offense getting ready to take the field”.
Here’s another eye opener.  I see a win at home against Washington State, but losses at Cal – Oregon, if not more.
Pete Carroll has led the most successful run in the modern era of college football.  Given all the success it’s so easy to slip into the role of a front-runner and just complain every time things don’t go our way. Truth is that football is a bone breaking and bruising game, mentally and physically, hard for grown men and 18-21 year olds alike.  Easy for us to sit in a chair, over-analyze and complain when things don’t go our way.  When it’s clear (as it is) that by the end of every footbal season we have the best coaching and the best players in the country, our role is to support the team and to be prepared to bleed Trojan cardinal and gold once in awhile.  This approach will help ensure Pete and company feel appreciated, remain at USC and continue to deliver at the top of their games.  We won’t know how much we will miss him until he is gone.

After dropping an early season game to an unranked Pac-10 opponent for the second consecutive year, the Trojans are looking to right  ship this week at the Coliseum against the Washington State Cougars.
Although the status of freshman quarterback Matt Barkley and senior All-American safety Taylor Mays are still day-to-day, USC coach Pete Carroll liked what he saw out of his team at practice yesterday.
Working his way · Matt Barkley, who did not play in Saturday’s loss, was able to practice Monday. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
“We came out and had a good day,” Carroll said. “We’ll do it one day at a time and get ourselves on track. The sense of urgency of doing things right is more obvious than ever in all phases, and we’re going to see if we can get going again.”
Barkley split throwing reps with redshirt sophomore quarterback Aaron Corp Monday as the freshman is trying to work his way back from a shoulder injury he suffered against Ohio State. While Barkley is still not 100 percent healthy, Carroll was encouraged what he saw in practice from his young quarterback.
“I’d love to see him get back out here and get back his spot,” Carroll said. “I don’t have any problem playing him if he’s OK this week. The fact that he could practice [Monday] was a great sign.”
Mays rested during most of practice Monday, as was planned by the coaching staff. He did participate in some running and back peddling drills, but he has still yet to go at full speed since injuring his right knee against the Buckeyes.
Even if both stars return to the Trojans this week, USC still has plenty of holes to fix both offensively and defensively if it hopes to win its remaining nine games of the regular season.
And Carroll is looking at himself and the coaching staff to address those issues.
“It’s more than just talk,” he said. “It’s habits, the sense of urgency and taking care of the ball. That’s why it’s my responsibility because it’s more than one guy.”
Carroll did emphasize that unlike last season’s loss against Oregon State where his team looked sluggish in the first half, the Trojans came out ready to play against the Huskies. But, he said, there are some parts of the game that can’t be controlled.
“Sometimes it’s the game, and as much as we work at it, it’s a great challenge to win every game. It’s a fantastic challenge,” he said.
After USC running backs combined for four fumbles Saturday at Washington, it was a mystery to some why redshirt junior running back C.J. Gable didn’t get any playing time.
Carroll revealed Sunday that Gable had the flu and he didn’t want to push him. But Monday’s at practice, Gable said he would have been ready to play if Carroll called his name.
“He said it looked like I wasn’t ready,” Gable said. “So I guess how I looked determines how I play I guess, but … if I say I’m ready to go, I’m ready to go. I know when my body is not ready to go.”
Gable also said it was frustrating to stand on the sideline and watch his fellow running backs lose the ball four times.
“If they fumble, and they get back in, then I guess those are the guys that can do that,” the running back said.
“Whenever I get my opportunities, I’m holding onto the ball, because it might be the last one I ever get,” he added.
Carroll said Gable has a chance to reclaim his spot in the rotation against Washington State.
Although he hasn’t started a game, redshirt freshman defensive end Nick Perry has made a strong case for a starting role early this season.
During USC’s first three games, Perry has racked up a team-high four sacks in a backup role and has recorded 10 tackles.
“He needs to play more for obvious reasons,” Carroll said. “He’s been so productive … Those are remarkable stats for a guy who hasn’t played very many snaps, so we’ve got to get him in the game more and see if he can keep going.”
Carroll also said if Perry has a good week at practice, he may start Saturday against the Cougars.
While four sacks in three games may seem tough to accomplish for a backup defensive end, Perry has an easy explanation for his success so far this year.
“Basically, I like getting at the quarterback a lot because I like making sacks. So, I have to just play to the best of my ability,” he said.

After a nine-year hiatus, Phi Gamma Delta, an international fraternity also known as “Fiji” or “Phi Gam,” returned to campus this semester and is prepared to deal with the issues that forced it from The Row initially.
Because of financial difficulties, Fiji closed its USC chapter in 2000 to pay off accumulating debts. With its return this year, members are making plans to keep this kind of problem from happening again.
Comeback · Recruiters from Phi Gamma Delta’s national office tell sophomore Collin Rice about the fraternity, which has returned to USC. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“We have an alumni adviser who is our financial adviser that will work hand-in-hand with the treasurer to look over the budget,” said Justin Burns, national director of chapter development. “The undergraduates are still in charge, but we have amazing alumni who … are advising in their areas of expertise.”
Its debt paid off, Fiji wanted to return to USC, so it applied and was selected by the university and the Interfraternity Council from among a number of international fraternities.
Ray Carlos, assistant director of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development at USC, said Fiji was selected because it has both a good system in place and an existing house on The Row.
“[Fiji] has alumni who are very involved on this campus. They have a very strong international headquarter, which means they have a number of people who can give resources and support for the chapter and the colony here,” Carlos said. “But most of all, they were very interfraternal. They knew that they were not going to come in and focus on themselves — they want to make the entire community better,”
The Fiji house, located on The Row, is currently leased to students from other fraternities and sororities. Though Fiji has returned to USC, the current residents will be allowed to remain in the house until their leases expire, Carlos said.
Meanwhile, Fiji is working to recruit a strong class of new members.
The fraternity has been contacting sorority chapter presidents, asking them to help find men on campus who are not Greek but would like to help start a Greek organization, Carlos said. Blessing Waung, president of the Panhellenic Council, said the sororities are willing to help out as much as possible.
“If they have events they want us to come out to, we’ll definitely be there to support them,” she said. “We’re really excited because there are so many fraternities that are coming back.”
Burns said he encourages students to consider becoming involved with Fiji because they will have the chance to be part of its founding pledge class.
“They have a great privilege, but more so, a responsibility to create a fraternity that is unique to this campus,” Burns said. “Over the next year or so, as this group continues to develop, they are setting the course, they are setting the tone as to where this is going to go.”
The membership process is recommendation-based and there is no rush process, Burns said.
“It’s a mutual decision. The men that we’re meeting with need to take time to talk about it with their friends to think about it themselves and to ask questions,” he said.
Some students said they would consider pledging Fiji, as opposed to other IFC fraternities.
Nick Valerio, a freshman majoring in fine arts, said he liked that there was no rush process.
“I’d be interested because the whole rush process is this whole big ordeal that’s really time-consuming,” Valerio said. “A lot of people are really turned off to the whole rush/frat, kind of thing.”
In addition to the benefit of being able to join a fraternity without rushing, Danny Luber, a freshman majoring in psychology, said he liked that Fiji was an international fraternity.
“The international idea is pretty cool,” Luber said. “Also, I think it would appeal to people who are … [now] interested in being involved in that, but they don’t want to go through the whole rush process.”
The fraternity began to recruit members on Sept. 9 and will continue to recruit until Oct. 21.

Though it achieved a No. 1 ranking in undergraduate satisfaction, USC’s Marshall School of Business fell four spots to No. 21 in BusinessWeek’s annual undergraduate business school rankings announced last week.
The rankings were compiled by the magazine along with College Prowler, a website that uses a formulaic methodology as well as student input to grade quantitative and qualitative aspects of American universities.
“We look at things across the board such as faculty to student ratio, overall academics, how many parking spaces there are, etc.,” said Luke Skurman, CEO of College Prowler. “And then there’s the qualitative side, where we ask students for their input on these various aspects of campus life.”
According to BusinessWeek’s   evaluation of its rankings, USC achieved its position in the undergraduate satisfaction list based on its favorable location, “top-notch” career facilities and the supportive alumni network, which it described as “a valuable commodity, especially in light of the current job market.”
BusinessWeek also cited the faculty as being one of Marshall’s greatest strengths.
Abby Chao, a freshman majoring in business administration, said she agreed with the magazine’s evaluation of the school.
“I’m only a freshman, but I know that Marshall has a lot of great programs, and they ensure that you don’t get ‘lost’ even though it’s the largest [professional] school at USC,” she said.
William Crookston, a professor of entrepreneurial studies, said he was also enthusiastic about the rankings.
“It’s terrific — I’m not excited about being 21st overall, but having a positive student satisfaction is great, and I believe it,” he said.
Having graduated from Marshall himself with a bachelor’s and a master’s in 1967 and 1974, respectively, Crookston was able to compare Marshall’s present goals and achievements with those from his time at USC.
“At that time, there was no need to compete nationally; we dominated the West Coast region in
undergraduate education at Marshall,” Crookston said. “Now we’ve got pretty strict competitors, but the overall goal of Marshall is the same as it was when I was here.”
Crookston also said the school could still improve its overall performance in rankings by turning some of the primary focus from master’s candidates to the
undergraduate students.
“It’s important to keep the students, or ‘products,’ happy,” Crookston said. “Though we can’t just let them slide through — it has to be rigorous. However, we must apparently be doing something right. Number one in student satisfaction is terrific.”
Let’s run a regression to see how much R-squared explains this ranking.

Most people understand that not everyone will subscribe to a social etiquette system, and that sometimes, you just have to tolerate what is normally accepted.
Not the co-creator of Seinfeld.
Uncomfortable · Larry David, the creator and star of HBO’s acclaimed series, Curb Your Enthusiasm, finds himself in the middle of many awkward situations in each episode. The series’ seventh season began Sunday. - Photo courtesy of Joshua Sankey
While the real Larry David understands people can’t always bend to his will, the exaggerated David on HBO’s Curb Your Enthusiasm constantly berates others as to why their opinion is wrong and searches for shortcuts to avoid difficult situations. Both usually end up backfiring.
Thankfully for viewers, David does not learn from his mistakes and continues to turn even the smallest irritants into a dilemma in the seventh season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, which premiered Sunday. Nearly a decade after the pilot episode aired in 2000, the series remains as satisfying and entertaining as ever.
The “Funkhouser’s Crazy Sister” episode opens with the traditional and simple “Frolic” theme as the phrase “Curb Your Enthusiasm” is superimposed over a black background. The first scene connects this season to the previous one with a look at Larry’s relation to the Black family, which is coincidentally African-American. As David tends to his bedridden girlfriend, Loretta Black (Vivica A. Fox), he squabbles with her over the temperature of the house at night. He prefers 68 degrees, which Loretta calls “white people shit,” preferring 75 degrees.
Humorous bits like these are scattered loosely throughout the first 10 minutes of the episode as series regulars, like Larry’s manager and best friend Jeff Greene (Jeff Garlin), make their on-screen appearances. Little has changed among David’s crew, and they still must put up with his misguided philosophy on proper social etiquette. The laughs are somewhat sparse early on as the audience is reacquainted with these characters, but this is to be expected from the first episode of a new season.
Before long, David finds himself in a familiar situation. By carelessly mentioning Jeff’s dinner party to Marty Funkhouser (Bob Einstein), who was not invited, the latter presses to come along with his sister Bam Bam (Catherine O’Hara), who was recently released from a mental institution. Along the way, David has several small quarrels and is the center of many awkward social moments. When Bam Bam tells everyone at the dinner party that David has been stealing food from her brother’s refrigerator, he passes the blame onto Jeff for sleeping with her.
While David has not changed, his social interactions seem to have improved since the last season because of his relationship with Loretta. But living with the Blacks has become a double-edged sword. Loretta’s sickness is starting to worry him — not because he is afraid of losing her, but because he might have to give up certain luxuries in order to take care of her.
A coldhearted side to David’s immaturity is revealed, giving the episode a more serious tone than one might expect. That’s not to say his interpretation of life has become any more critical, but that the means of exposing his misanthropic attitude have, as they now hold larger consequences for the other characters. And though it is still humorous, this episode’s closing “Larry David moment” is also a bit more ominous.
Likewise, other series regulars are becoming more conscious of David’s faults and are starting to question them. Jeff asks David why he bothers making a big deal over the social conventions of a dinner party, while Loretta’s doctor says he should prioritize her illness when David begins discussing the tediousness of feeding goldfish. In the past, other characters would argue with David over his ridiculous customs, but they would almost never confront him about it.
While the show has now focused on more serious events in David’s life, it does not feel like a great leap for Curb Your Enthusiasm — and it is not supposed to. Instead, it speaks to David’s ability to not only amplify minor annoyances into big problems, but also view serious matters in a very relaxed and comical light.
The show takes seemingly ordinary moments of his life and turns them into interesting and funny events that somehow matter more than they should. By staying true to this recipe, this season will no doubt please fans and continue to make the audience wonder why Larry David does what he does.
“A coldhearted side to David’s immaturity is revealed”?
Have you ever watched Curb Your Enthusiasm before? He’s been much colder and much more immature. The woman is being a bitch to him, and he never really had great feelings for her in the first place. Now he’s finding out that he needs to devote the next 3 or 4 years of his life to her, without so much as a chance to play 9 holes of golf.
I don’t know many men who wouldn’t have acted the same way in similar circumstances. As far as being coldhearted goes, this doesn’t even come close to comparing to when he hung up on Cheryl when she was in life-threatening turbulence on an airplane, just because he wanted to talk to the TiVo guy. And people have always confronted Larry on his mannerisms. Cheryl left him. Ted Danson kicked him out of a house party. This article is forced.
You writers need to do your homework instead of just scribbling something quick to turn in.

Matt Damon has an identity problem.
In The Talented Mr. Ripley, his naïve sycophant Tom Ripley turns into a remorseless murderer. In the Bourne trilogy, his former assassin Jason Bourne struggles with his disjointed past. In The Departed, his charismatic police officer Colin Sullivan acts as a double agent for an Irish mob boss.
Loose lips · Matt Damon stars as Mark Whitacre in Steven Soderbergh’s The Informant!. The film is based on the true story of Archer Daniels Midland’s international price-fixing fraud that occurred during the ’90s. - Photo courtesy of Warner Bros.
For yet another award-winning director, Damon plays that seemingly good guy with a secret — a technique he has apparently mastered throughout his career. While his past troubled, dishonest and terribly crafty characters were undeniably intriguing, Damon has latched onto the best liar out of all of them.
That liar would be Mark Whitacre, the former division president of Archer Daniels Midland, an agricultural corporation that found itself bathed in global spotlight in the mid-’90s for an international price-fixing conspiracy.
The man who acted as an informant for the FBI and blew the whistle on ADM’s corporate misbehavior? Whitacre. The man who embezzled $9 million from the company? Also Whitacre.
This living, breathing, walking paradox is the subject of Academy Award-winning director Steven Soderbergh’s latest based-on-actual-events film, The Informant!
Adapted from the nonfiction book of the same name, The Informant! follows Whitacre through the ’90s as he becomes a national celebrity for his extensive role in exposing ADM’s fraud. A hardworking family man living in Illinois, Whitacre — who worked as a biochemist before turning into a businessman — is ordinary in appearance yet extraordinary in intelligence, a characteristic that soon becomes Whitacre’s tragic flaw.
Damon is one of those actors who continually goes above and beyond the limitations placed upon him with his God-given boyish features. Though he dons a round prosthetic nose, an ill-fitting mustache and a pudgy midsection, Damon’s performance transcends his external modifications as he captures the essence of the character through his most minute mannerisms and fast-talking speech, delivering exaggerrated lines like “I’m 0014, because I’m twice as smart as 007” with ease.
But as mesmerizing as Damon is on screen, the true hero of the film is Soderbergh.
Soderbergh has built his extensive career around films that focus on real-life figures, which vary from activists (Erin Brockovich) to revolutionaries (Che: Part One and Two). Despite being based on actual events, The Informant! is, ironically enough, a departure from the decorated filmmaker’s filmography.
In a risky move, Soderbergh chose not to meet with anyone involved in the conspiracy, Whitacre’s personal life or even Whitacre — an uncharacteristic decision for the director who invited the real Erin Brokovich to the set of his Oscar-winning film of the same name. But with a subject that constantly treads the line between fact and fiction, Soderbergh’s disregard for sticking to the truth ultimately feeds his vision, enabling him to take Whitacre and his story and run wildly with it. Free from eyewitness accounts and evidential constraints, Soderbergh is at the height of his creativity and, as a result, The Informant! becomes Soderbergh’s most stylized film of his career.
In yet another bold move, Soderbergh opted for comedy over drama with Scott Z. Burns’ script, taking an inherently serious situation and flipping it onto its side to expose the satire hidden within the corporate structure. The casting of well-known comedians — Joel McHale, Scott Adsit and Tony Hale — in supporting roles combined with the sunny jazz score by notorious film composer Marvin Hamlisch (A Chorus Line) and the ’70s sitcom throwback tonally completes Soderbergh’s absurdist piece on corporate corruption.
The further Soderbergh pushes his satire, however, the less room he leaves for the emotional dissection of his characters, and the audience cannot help but feel cheated by Soderbergh’s purposefully shallow direction.
But possessing a lack of heart is key when it comes to comedy, a genre that garners the most laughs from a character’s mishaps. With Whitacre, all Soderbergh had to do was sit back and let his main character attempt to talk his way out of trouble, and the laughs are there.
Whitacre intrigues his audience not by the magnitude of his plans or his incredible skill, but by his inability to differentiate between his own little world and the actual state of reality which causes him to constantly lie to nearly everyone he sees. He is at once the film’s protagonist and antagonist, the good guy the audience is rooting for and the bad guy the audience is hoping will fail.
It’s both frustrating and heartbreaking to watch Whitacre entangle himself in his web of lies; it’s even more frustrating to watch Whitacre fail to arc as a character. But as Soderbergh left Whitacre’s suicide attempt on the cutting room floor, it is assumed that the director wanted his protagonist to flatline in order to further reaffirm the ultimate thesis behind his satire: Some people are simply unable to change.
It’s the sole, sad truth in Soderbergh’s shady masterpiece.

A few months ago, a friend of mine decided to jump on the Twitter bandwagon. When I, a social media aficionado, asked him how he was enjoying the network, he merely shrugged.
“I guess it’s kind of nice having another thing to check,” he said.
I endlessly pondered his nonchalant response. How, I thought, could someone think of Twitter as just “another thing to check?” It is the ultimate social network! It is revolutionizing communication, and no one shall belittle it by considering it merely “another thing to check!”
It wasn’t until I took a few deep breaths that I realized how right he was.
When I open a web browser, I instinctively open a tab for Facebook, a tab for my email and a tab for Twitter. This is my daily routine because it allows me to see what is going on in my social and professional lives.
I check all three pages almost every day, and perhaps the craziest part about that habit is how it compares to my routine five years ago. Tenth-grade Jen satisfied the need to network through AIM and MySpace, and she spent so much time on each that her mother actually reverse grounded her and made her leave the house. Typically she would go to a friend’s place, and they would get on AIM and MySpace together (which was more fun, anyway).
Unlike the Xanga trend that only hit a certain crowd, everyone I knew had a screen name and a MySpace page. In regards to why we overlooked Friendster and other social networks, it was a classic chain of circumstances — we used these particular applications because everyone else in school did.
MySpace was once the coolest digital hangout, but as soon as Facebook allowed high school users, we abandoned our old stomping ground. We were quick to fall for Facebook’s clean interface, among other things. Today, the simplicity and personal nature of the website remain the aspects that compel us to check it daily.
MySpace, however, was not ready to die. Instead of letting the tumbleweeds roll through, the website was able to find a new niche, gradually arriving at the primary purpose of hosting music. The site had been forced to fill a totally different role in our lives, and it complied because we told it to.
Popular social networking sites are large companies with business plans and CEOs, but at the end of the day, it is their users who call the shots. Twitter, for example, morphs daily into whatever the “tweeps” want it to be. The service has played the role of everything from investigative reporter (as seen in the Iranian election) to marketing tool (as in our last election). When somebody slips up (like Kanye at the VMAs), the Twittosphere erupts in laughter, and when somebody dies (like Michael Jackson), it breaks out in tears.
When Twitter was founded, it really had no point. It existed to facilitate communication, but no one could have guessed the countless ways it would be employed. However, while its many facets are the reason Twitter has become one of my Internet staples, its ambiguity confuses a lot of people — 60 percent quit within their first month, hardly giving the network a chance.
Social networking sites are just like other goods and services; they work by laws of supply and demand. If we need an online system to talk about music, one will rise from the binary codes and appear (oh hey, Last.fm). The tricky part happens when we don’t know we need something, or, in Twitter’s case, when we don’t really know what something is.
Twitter’s uncertain purpose has caused it to be received poorly by those who don’t feel like interpreting it. The irony is that it is essentially the network’s undefined function that is its function — it can play the role of whatever the user wants.
In retrospect, I see that my friend was giving Twitter a compliment. Though I initially found his remark offensive, I now realize he had classified the network in the same realm as Facebook and email.  In his opinion, these are today’s online essentials, as AIM and MySpace once were.
Though it pains me that I used to be so obsessed with MySpace, I recognize that the site was once the standard — and it still is for some people. The things we “check” determine how we interact with the Internet, and that relationship is an important one. As it follows, while we are able to define the role of social networks, they too can define us.

Pointless, vacuous article. Save it for Twitter next time. At least that way it would be short.

If undivided audience attention is what you want at work, then there are many careers to pursue, including stripping. But becoming a professor is not one of them. Any student that has ever sat in the back row of a big lecture class, or is sitting in one right now, knows that even the most dynamic professors have problems maintaining  the attention of a classroom.
Too often, a theoretical analysis of the lesser-known works of John Milton is less compelling than a text message, a game of Snood or some crappy article in the campus paper. Let’s face it, if copies of the Daily Trojan were replaced with used cereal boxes, most people would read the backs of them rather than face another two hours of PowerPoint-induced stupor.

That’s why it’s curious that in a profession where any attention at all is desirable, getting unwanted attention from your audience poses a considerable threat. But it turns out that for all the students who couldn’t care less about a 16th century British poetry class, there might be one stalker who cares altogether too much.
According to a 2007 study conducted at seven Indiana University campuses, one-third of professors reported to being victims of stalking, a significantly higher percentage than the 5-6 percent of the general population who have experienced the same thing.
The study focused on professors being stalked by their students, and the professors were most likely to report invasion of space, unwanted gifts and messages of affection, and being followed around.
Given that there are at least some readers trying to remember what their current professor’s name is, it seems there is no happy medium in collegiate teaching. If you’re a professor, you’re either coaxing term papers out of students who only remember the parts of lecture when they weren’t searching “puppy sumo wrestling” on Youtube, or you’re coming back to your office to discover a 61-page love letter and a bottle of Sex Panther cologne.
For those readers currently wondering why a student would find himself obsessed with someone whom he knows only in the context of an introductory microeconomics class, the study offers no insight. It does say that male professors were just as likely to report being stalked as female professors in the study, suggesting that there is no gender bias when it comes to the eroticism of a lecture on Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations.
Of course, stalking is no laughing matter. Before the editorial director is flooded with angry emails, let it be said that anyone, student or professor, who has fallen victim to a stalker should alert safety officials and take necessary precautions, including avoiding all conversations centered on Adam Smith.
After all, the sad fact of the matter is that even stalkers aren’t good students. Some professors reported giving their stalkers higher grades than they deserved and reducing the amount of work in the class, indicating that students who shower professors in affection and listen to their private cell phone conversations in the bathroom are still performing poorly in the classroom.
Maybe stripping is a better career option after all. Sure, stalkers are still an issue, but at least you don’t need to bribe them with grades.
Laura Reeve is a senior majoring in public relations.
It should be in all syllabi, “Stalking or harrassment by students to instructor will automatically result in a failing grade, and potential criminal charges…”

The paradox of transit in Los Angeles suggests the solution in spite of itself. Automotives are foundational to Angeleno iconography, yet the city is notorious for smog and gridlock.
The Car Almighty is a rolling contradiction — often associated with the nostalgia of wealth, class and modernity. Yet here in Los Angeles where the car reigns supreme, the consequences are hard to miss: the wasted time, the environmental and health concerns, the inefficiency.
Reducing the impact of automotives is a worldwide initiative. Unfortunately, the issue often finds itself shelved alongside whale-saving and world peace. Noble pursuits of course, but none of us are equipped to single-handedly purge the oceans of toxic waste, let alone devise some way to prevent every future war. Sure, if I happen to run across a dastardly fisherman with his harpoon trained on some innocent beluga, I’ll ask him to cut it out. Maybe I’ll even push him. Until then, I’m opting for a less confrontational, exceedingly more approachable crusade: alternative transportation.
Emerging from the now defunct USC Fixed, Southern California Alternative Transportation is taking on big transit issues in our community, and is inviting students to come along for the ride. SCAT functions under the broader concept of sustainable transportation, and can therefore get more people involved in accomplishing bigger objectives.
Co-founder Charlie Furman, a junior majoring in critical studies, said SCAT’s goals range “from knowledge of maintaining a bicycle, to networking for people who want to go on group rides with other students, to better conditions for people using non-motor transportation.” Furman said that “the biggest thing [SCAT is] working on is a student bus pass similar to what numerous other schools throughout the country have.”
Improving student and community relationships with sustainable transit will require more than just providing know-how and opportunities. Meaningful, enduring change requires a shift in mentality: mainly, helping the community work past the well-ingrained concept of cars as the norm. A considerable population out there knows about the problem, wants to help out, but doesn’t know how.
Furman said the group can help. “We’re planning on having various bike, pedestrian and bus trips around LA to different places that a lot of people think you have to drive to,” he said.
Group excursions to places like the beach and the Hollywood sign will take that critical step towards re-teaching people how to think about and engage in transit.
SCAT is providing an enormous service to the USC and Los Angeles communities by making these realistic, practical solutions available.
In Los Angeles, any sense of hopelessness in the alternative transportation movement is amplified by the social (air)conditioning of the car culture. The mentality behind this car culture is rooted in that pesky old American Dream. Cherry red convertibles are as American as apple pie. As the country’s largest West Coast city and the home of Hollywood, Los Angeles is the city of manifest destiny. It’s not just the dream of something better, but also the materialization of it.
For years, that “something better” meant comfort. Cars offer instant comfort — this I can’t deny. But indulging in Happy Days nostalgia for an era when consumption meant liberty isn’t going to stay comfortable forever.
I’m all for comfort, don’t get me wrong. But as we creep towards completing the first decade of the new millennium, it is increasingly difficult to pretend that a smog-choked city is a lost cause, or that car culture is so critical to our economy that it can’t change.
We’ve inherited car culture, but we can’t keep relying on it. It’s time to take the reigns (or the handlebars, or even the bus). It’s time to hold ourselves to our own highest standards. Here on the USC campus, SCAT provides Joe Trojan with a minimal-effort opportunity to start making a difference.
Kelsey McLane is a junior majoring in international relations.
So nice to see this!  Riding a bike or even taking the bus are infinitely more relaxing than driving in Los Angeles.  Knowing how to navigate these two modes of transportation makes L.A. seem a lot smaller.  Yay for SCAT!
Nice work, Kelsey!

Last Saturday I took Metro from Hollywood to Long Beach for a baby shower. Although I had to take 2 buses, the Red line, and the Blue line, it went smoothly and was pretty fast.  After the last bus, I had to walk about a mile (gasp!) to the house where the shower was held.  My brother and his wife attended, too. They drove.  They were feeling sorry for  me since I took Metro.  I appreciated the ride home in their car, but we got stuck in traffic on the freeway and it probably took as long as the Metro ride had.  My brother and his wife are both overweight and my brother has diabetes.  His doctor recommends more exercise.  If only I could change his mindset on public transportation…….

When we decide to take on the selfless act of parenthood, we instantly commit ourselves to a few sacrifices. We sacrifice our sense of smell, having to change toxic diapers countless times each day. We resign ourselves to sleep deprivation, knowing that we must wake up at 4 a.m. to tend to a crying child even if we may feel like crying ourselves.
And we make a pledge to self-control, convincing ourselves that we don’t need the plasma TV we’ve been dying for and that instead, we must buy only necessities — you know, like food and milk.
It goes without saying that new parents (responsible ones anyway) also commit to raising their children to become the best, most honorable adults they can grow up to be. This last commitment is a bit trickier than the rest.
Equipped with endless bank accounts and a bounty of resources unattainable by the common man, celebrities at first may appear most fit for the role of parenthood. Ironically, this statement could not be any more untrue. Famous parents, like the Paltrow-Martins, the Beckhams and the Stefani-Rossdales, are creating a disastrous yet long-term parenting trend not just in the world of Hollywood but for new parents everywhere.
With finger snaps, head twists and the public going “Oh no they didn’t,” these stars are guilty of committing the ultimate parenting faux-pas: the weird baby name.
From the minute these young tots are born into pop culture royalty, celebrity babies are marked with an intrinsic uniqueness. That’s a given.
It is one thing to have mommy and daddy’s superstar blood running through you but it is definitely another to be unable to exist in normal situations because you have been named after a breakfast snack or some sort of indigenous tribe.
Due to some reckless decision-making on their parents’ part, these kids will undoubtedly face confusion with the titles they’ve been given and struggle with how they must live up to them.
Pilot Inspektor. Apple. Zuma. Brooklyn. Kal-El. Bronx Mowgli. Maddox. Moxie CrimeFighter. No, I did not just break into an impromptu game of Taboo.
These names and others like them will soon populate roll sheets in kindergarten classes in the 90210 zip code and beyond. They are reaching new levels of absurdity, deriving from superhero inspirations and New York cities, each made to outdo the ones before.
Take Nicole Richie and Joel Madden for example. Last week, the couple welcomed their second child, a baby boy named Sparrow.
Now to answer your questions: Yes, the baby was human, and no, he did not have wings.
While ridiculous baby naming has become something like cricket or polo — a sort of game only for the rich to play — the fact is that this traditional rite of passage has transformed from a parental milestone to a downright ego-booster. The art of procreation has become a way for famous people to reproduce “Mini-Me”s to play dress-up with in baby Juicy Couture tracksuits and show off to the world.
Naturally, celebrities and the eccentric names they choose reinforce a dimension of “betterness” that separate the Suris from the Sarahs, the Kingstons from the Kyles and the Jermajestys from the average Joes. In a day when the challenge is to stand out, anything less would not live up to the lofty self-importance that celebrities possess not just for themselves but for their little bundles of joy as well.
Likewise, the baby has, for the last couple years, become Hollywood’s must-have accessory. Why tote around the newest handbag when you can parade around the next King or Queen of Pop, president or Oscar winner? Perhaps, in this sense, maybe interesting baby names aren’t so bad. After all, the world could always use one less “George” to make room for more “Beyoncés” and “Baracks.”
In the end, parenthood and the name game could also just be moneymakers. Celebrities want their kids to expand their respective empires, and, more often than not, serve as a reflection of the vain characteristics that once propelled them to fame.
My only thought: Thank God, Paris Hilton has not yet caught on.
