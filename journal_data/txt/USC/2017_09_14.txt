Beginning Spring 2018, the Keck School of Medicine will offer a new two-unit elective course, “SCRM 517: Historical and Contemporary Stem Cell Research.” The course, which is geared toward master’s students, will be taught by Professor Rong Lu in the Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine. 
Lu plans to cover significant developments in stem cell research history. Unlike other courses, she says SCRM 517 will also emphasize the experimental techniques and methods used in past developments, allowing students to gain applicable skills for future research.
“[The course’s] idea is to think about how to address the question, how to design the experiment and to understand the goal of the experiment, the potential problem, and what are the new knowledge we can gain from the experiment,” Lu said. “[This will give] them an overview of experimental design and … a platform to discuss the research and potential problems.”
While Lu will start teaching the course in her third year at USC, the idea for the course came years prior during her postdoctoral work under Professor Irving Weissman at Stanford’s Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine. 
Weissman noted that while many classes involved research, few taught students how to do so. With that, an idea was born.
“[Research is the] kind of a thing we are doing everyday but there’s not … a direct thing [to teach that],” Lu said. “Most of the courses just teach you what we learn from those studies, but exactly how those studies came about, why people do this study … how does those specific study … give us the new knowledge [isn’t taught].”
Although Lu is unsure how many will take the course, she hopes to have between 10 and 20 students enrolled to ensure a workshop-style feel in the class. To provide a refreshing and entertaining perspective on course materials, Lu will also utilize in-class discussions and exercises based on the research conducted to allow students to practice their skills. 
And for Lu, there’s no better discussion topic than stem cells. She’s been fascinated with them since 1997, when Dolly the sheep became the world’s first cloned mammal, during her senior year of high school. 
“I feel like this is a very interesting question, a very interesting problem and also has enormous medical potential,” she said. 
She hopes the class will spark in her students the same inquisitive interest that’s driven her for the past 20 years. 
“I want it to be a little bit more interactive … [with] more experimental and more exploring in class,” Lu said.

Economics is the largest major within the USC Dornsife School for Letters, Arts and Sciences, according to Economics Department Chair Matthew Kahn. The economics major has grown 36 percent from the fall semester of 2010 to 2016, with over 1,000 students in Fall 2017. 
“The reason why I became an economist 30 years ago is because when I was a little kid I would read The New York Times and I would read facts and I didn’t understand why facts were facts,” Kahn said. “It occurred to me that I could better understand these facts if I had training in economics.”
Training in economics helps students become a more sophisticated reader of news and analyzer of data, Kahn said. He also believes the 21st century is the age of “Big Data.” 
“Those young people who know how to see patterns in data are going to have a lot of career success,” Kahn said. 
Emma Hyams, a senior majoring in economics, expressed similar thoughts when she decided to transfer into the program. 
As a freshman, Hyams found herself struggling to sit through her introduction to computing and discrete math classes in the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
“Looking at the list of all the electives that [economics majors] had, everything sounded so interesting to me [compared to] the computer science electives I would have to take [as that major],” Hyams said. 
After taking a statistics for economics class with Professor Manochehr Rashidian, Hyams officially switched her major as a junior in Fall 2016. 
Hyams is part of a growing trend of students at USC choosing to study economics. In Fall 2016, 14 percent of Dornsife declared majors are studying economics, according to Kahn. 
He attributes part of the program’s success to its rigorous quantitative training, especially in econometrics. The University’s econometrics program is ranked 11th in the world, according to IDEAS, an online research economics database. Companies like Amazon, Netflix and Google have also recently started hiring more economists well-versed in econometrics to analyze emerging business patterns, Kahn said. 
Over the years, the economics department has recruited new faculty to improve the program. In January, Romain Ranciere, former professor of economics at the Paris School of Economics and senior economist at the International Monetary Fund, joined the staff as the department vice chair to teach a course on the causes and consequences of international financial crises. Similarly, Paulina Oliva, associate professor at UC Irvine will teach an environmental economics class next semester. 
Senior economics major Eric Bittner admires his professors and their diverse economic backgrounds and opinions. 
“We get insights into all different aspects of economics,” Bittner said. 
Kahn believes hiring strong researchers and committed teachers will create more opportunities for undergraduates to work closely with faculty both inside and outside of the classroom. 
Director of Undergraduate Studies and economics professor Mark Moore added the major’s growth has been spurred by student leaders and external events. 
“We have re-established an undergraduate economics association and it has become very active and we are working with them to create a lot of career events, so we are encouraging students to get involved and we are interested in having students participate in the education they want,” Moore said.

For the first time in perhaps my entire life, I cried re-watching the highlights of this week’s season opening Monday Night Football game.
I didn’t care about the score or the two teams playing, and I wasn’t watching the highlight reel for the game itself. Instead, I was crying listening to Beth Mowins commentate play-by-play on the biggest night of the week for my favorite sport.
This Monday marked the first time a woman has ever called play-by-play of primetime NFL football. For Mowins, it was the biggest moment of her career. For ESPN, it was a gutsy, although timely, business move. But for the women like me who tuned in on Monday night, it was something more — confirmation, encouragement and much-needed validation of our place in the sports world.
Every girl who grew up loving sports has dealt with pretty much the same experience of being doubted, questioned or ridiculed for her love of sports. It doesn’t matter if you’re named after your mom’s favorite NHL player, or you’re dressed in your team’s jersey with matching socks and sunglasses, or you’ve been hollering at Kansas basketball head coach Bill Self to run zone defense for the past 20 minutes of the watch party. If you hear a girl talking about sports, there’s a good chance that a guy is about to put her down.
My favorite part of being a female sports fan is what I like to call the “Sexist Quiz” — when you tell a boy that you love sports and he immediately responds with a meaningless trivia question.
It backfires on occasion, of course. My freshman year, a guy saw my Royals hat during the World Series and jokingly bet me a coffee that I couldn’t name five players. The look on his face when I named the entire batting line-up in less than a minute was obviously worth more than the coffee he ended up reluctantly handing over. 
But this type of interaction is common, and most of the time, it doesn’t have an empowering ending. Those questions aren’t actually meant to quiz or to test knowledge. They’re meant to prove a point: that the girl in the room isn’t welcome into the age-old tradition of casually sharing hot takes and fantasy football outlooks with fellow sports-loving strangers.
Once in an interview, an athlete doubted my basketball knowledge and refused to change the subject until I named the starting lineup of the Golden State Warriors, a team I do not follow and don’t particularly care about. He laughed when I didn’t know the answer, and I lost every ounce of confidence I had mustered to ask him a few questions about an upcoming game. The following interview was pretty much useless, and I trudged home feeling defeated.
Sadly, that experience is an everyday occurence for women who love sports. Being laughed at and mocked, tested and quizzed by men who know the same amount or less about the topic is just another day at the office, leaving women to feel lost and out of place, most importantly.
That’s why I cried when I heard Beth Mowins’ voice. 
To me, it didn’t matter if she was good. She could’ve flubbed every other word for the entire broadcast and I would’ve defended her to my grave. For the first time in my 15-year love affair with football, when I flicked on the television, I heard the voice of a woman like me.
It was the ultimate confirmation that yes, we do belong here. We belong in stadiums and press boxes, and we belong on couches and barstools. Our opinions about sports matter, even if half-drunk dimwits at the bar and on Twitter want to question them. 
And she was brilliant. Mowins is, of course, one of the best that ESPN has to offer, which is why it’s honestly surprising she didn’t make it to NFL primetime earlier after years of calling college football. In the spotlight, she didn’t waver at all.
After her historic broadcast, Mowins didn’t take to social media to pen a heartfelt thank you. Instead, she posted a single picture: herself on the sidelines, smiling, as a young girl named Avery held a sign in the stands.
“Beth,” the sign read. “I’m ready for my internship.”
Mowins didn’t say much about the picture, just three words: “Avery’s got next.”
But she didn’t need to say much more, because those three words said it all. Mowins was the first, but she will not be the last. And her first will give way to plenty of other firsts, for plenty of other girls throughout the country.
It doesn’t have to be this type of first, with a million-dollar contract and millions of fans watching. For most girls, the firsts will be smaller. It will be that moment of walking through the living room, hearing a woman’s voice and the roar of the crowd and pausing for a second to fall a little bit in love with football.
And I think that Beth would agree that a quiet moment like that is just as important, if not endlessly more.

This week, the sixth-ranked men’s tennis kicked off its fall tournament schedule at the Claremont Futures Tournament in Claremont, Calif., as USC looked to earn wildcard spots in the Claremont Pro Futures Tournament. Trojan juniors Jack Jaede and Laurens Verboven surpassed the qualifying round and competed in the main draw on Wednesday. Both entered the tournament unseeded. Jaede defeated teammate Thibault Forget to advance, while Verboven took out the No. 1 seed, Cal graduate Florian Lakat, 6-4, 7-5.
The Men of Troy now have a packed schedule for the remainder of September, traveling around California to play in various tournaments, and topping off the month in Tulsa, Okla., for the St. Francis Health System ITA All-American Championships on Sept. 30. The squad’s only home match will take place on
Oct. 26, in the SoCal Intercollegiate Championships.
Though every team, every year must face the loss of its graduates, the Trojans are coming back from their loss with an interesting twist. David Laser, Nick Crystal and Rob Bellamy have now finished their collegiate tennis careers, making room for a pair of impact freshmen: Daniel Cukierman and Mateusz Smolicki.
“They bring a love for the game of tennis and maturity,” head coach Peter Smith said. “Although they are freshmen, they are both a little older and are not your typical freshmen.”
Cukierman, 21, and Smolicki, 19, are currently ranked on the ATP World Tour at 579 and 610, respectively.
Last year, the Trojans clinched their third Pac-12 championship in an upset over UCLA. However, coming off of a conference title means little to Smith.
“This is ’SC — a lot more is expected than a Pac-12 championship,” Smith said.
After winning the conference, however, the Trojans could not keep the ball rolling through the NCAA Championships. After entering as the No. 4 seed, the team made easy work of Denver in the first round, defeating the Pioneers 4-0. In the Sweet Sixteen, USC topped Wisconsin 4-0.
But the Trojans couldn’t overcome Georgia in the quarterfinals. USC fell 4-3 in a tight loss to the No. 13 seed, and the Bulldogs went on to lose to Virginia in the championship as the Cavaliers took home their third straight national title.
USC aims to rebound from last season’s disappointment, starting with a strong fall season. The team will be in Napa, Calif., for its next tournament on Friday. The Napa Challenge kicks off on Sept. 15 and runs through the weekend.

The sophomore album is arguably the most challenging record an artist will make in their career. Some might risk it all and experiment with new sounds, while some may stay in their lane and produce a commercially viable album. For British singer Daley, who is the European equivalent of Scott Hoying (for those unfamiliar Americans), detaching from the norm and pivoting into his own lane was no option; instead, it was survival. The Spectrum is a vibrant R&B/soul album. Musically, Daley is in an untouchable space. His vocal quality and ability is unmatched in comparison to the modern male artist. 
Who artists collaborate with truly speaks to their personality, influence and musical knowledge. “Until The Pain Is Gone” features R&B powerhouse Jill Scott — who, in her own right, paved the way for neo-soul artists like Daley. Collaborating with Scott is a testament to his artistry and personal acknowledgement of soul and R&B greatness before him.  As a result, their voices blend perfectly together. The song evokes a DeBarge song: tender, sexy and soulful. Yet, melodically, the phrasing can put listeners in the realm of Chaka Khan. Bold horns and funky guitar licks build the base of the song, which is fueled by loud percussive elements and wistful strings. 
“Selfish” follows and shows listeners a more personal side of Daley. A blunt confessional that explores a fusion of electronic and soul as his vocals effortlessly glide against the xSDTRK-produced (pronounced “soundtrack”)  track. “The Only One,” is a throwback to Motown soul. The simplified track lends itself to minimal production. Doo-wop harmonies fill the space as the familiar falsetto belts out his frustrations to a loved one. The massive drums switch up the four/four signature used throughout the record and move into 6/8 time. 
“Second To None” is another slow track, letting listers focus on the writing skills Daley poses. His songs are far from cookie-cutter or redundant. He is a soul singer. Period. Soul music has its recurring themes, but Daley approaches love, heartbreak and struggle in a new and authentic light. The song is a feel-good record. His soft vocals make listening seamless and with every transition, his voice creeps back into your ears, making sure every moment is soothing and comforting. 
While the album is decent, the issue with Daley lies in the fact that he is greatly unappreciated. After being let go by Republic Records, he’s found a new home at BMG. However, music is timely. The Spectrum was released three years after his debut album. For an artist who is not known on a mainstream level, he demanded much too long of a wait. Listeners are hungry. Daley faces this issue and unfortunately, an even bigger problem: the return of Sam Smith. With Sam Smith releasing new music, any European man with a silky falsetto is in danger of being cast in Mr. Smith’s shadow. Perhaps Daley’s outspoken honesty, musicality and drive will push him into the limelight he greatly deserves.

When USC announced CAVA Grill as the first restaurant to open at USC Village, students from the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area were ecstatic. Founded in 2015 in the nation’s capital, the fast-food chain combines Chipotle’s “build-your-own-bowl” style with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavors. With the motto “For those who savor,” CAVA knows how to appeal to each and every tastebud. 
Since its introduction, the USC Village CAVA has seen lines lasting almost 20 minutes long. The restaurant is nestled under Building 8, en route to both Trader Joe’s and Target. With many mainstream eateries on campus, it is hard to find something new or unique within walking distance of campus. As one of the only eateries currently open at USC Village, CAVA reels in many customers by virtue of its location. With construction still occurring throughout the premises, the lit-up “CAVA” sign provides comfort for hungry students. Its modern feel with wooden interiors and metal counters add to a cafeteria-esque vibe. And the chaotic scene only adds to the excitement of the process. Once the line shuffles inside the restaurant, it’s difficult to hear virtually anything, let alone the staff. The tables are seldom empty at peak times, and the chairs are filled with both USC students and neighborhood residents. The establishment also offers a calmer outdoor seating if one wishes to escape the noise. 
The assembly line of workers begin the process that feels all-too-familiar after a few visits. The staff are friendly and efficient as they slide a brown paper bowl to each section of the process. The “build it” bowl starts off with pita, then grains, then transitions to dips, protein, toppings, and finally, a drench of their mouth-watering dressings. With about 13 toppings and five different dressings, the diverse range of spreads provides nearly unlimited combinations  and entices patrons to come back for more.
Shonali Bose | Daily Trojan
The bowls are both colorful and unique in flavor. The “base” of the meal ranges from healthy and fresh salads (SuperGreens, Organic Arugula, Spinach) to a large, warm pita filled with items of your choosing. With advertisements about their partner farms spread around the store, customers can expect a natural meal which differs from their chain competitors near the University’s campus. With price points nearing $10, it is clear why students may opt for other eateries around campus. However, for a meal as concentrated and different as CAVA’s the price point is somewhat understandable. 
The flavors of the bowl have its own idiosyncratic taste and smell, but surely do not disappoint. The vibrant nature of the bowl is both eye-popping and fascinating. Colors of red, purple and bright green stuff the paper to-go bowl. The smell permeates the room and dominates the experience of trying the bowl. With incredibly unique flavors, the CAVA “build-it” bowl is interesting in its taste. The flavors that D.C. natives can only pin as a “CAVA” at first seem hectic and messy, but later mold together in a delectable fashion. While it takes some getting used to, it is hard to resist a second CAVA bowl after devouring your first. 
From Chipotle to Panda Express, USC has seen many cafeteria-esque eateries which are essentially made for a quick bite in between classes. However, the introduction of CAVA to Downtown and the USC village elevates the game of the swift lunch experience. For dinner with friends, a snack during homework or a pit-stop on a crazy day, CAVA is highly recommended for University students looking for something substantial, rare and scrumptious.

After a dominant home stand this past weekend — comfortably defeating Santa Clara and Iowa State — the No. 12 women’s soccer team goes back on the road, looking to bolster its record against Loyola Marymount and San Diego.   
Loyola Marymount (4-2-2) also played a weekend home stand this past week, hosting UC Irvine and Long Beach State, and taking 4 points from those two matches.  The Lions, just like Santa Clara last week, have experience playing ranked Pac-12 opposition, besting No. 25 Utah 1-0 at home.  
The Lions last played on Sunday against Long Beach State, edging out a 2-0 victory.  Even though Loyola Marymount was outshot in this game, the Lions’ defense was stout throughout the entirety of the match, only allowing nine shots, with incredibly only one allowed in the second half. 
The Lions are a second-half team this year, with seven of their 10 goals scored coming in the last 45 minutes of the game. Due to the Lions’ solid defense and tendency for second-half surges, the Trojans must continue to capitalize on their opportunities in and around the penalty box and stay focused throughout the full 90 minutes if they want to continue the win streak.
This mentality was shared by junior forward Leah Pruitt, who said the team needs to “keep going out strong, hard [and] getting goals early” in order to be successful this weekend.
Friday’s game is a rematch from last year, when the Trojans comfortably beat the Lions 2-0 at home.  However, it will not be so straightforward this time, as Loyola Marymount have three players with multiple goals this season, making it even more important for the Trojans’ back line to defend as a unit to successfully thwart a multi-pronged Lions attack.  The Trojans are on the right track in this regard, only allowing one goal over the past two games, keeping a shutout against Iowa State.  This defensive astuteness will have to be at peak performance if this impressive defensive record is to continue.
San Diego (1-5-0) should be an easy test for the Trojans on Sunday.  Their last game was also against Long Beach State last Friday, but the Toreros were on the wrong side of a 3-0 result.  They were only able to muster three shots (one on goal) the entire game, while conceding 13 shots.  This lack of defensive solidity at the back should be welcome news for the Trojans, who recently have had no problem getting shots off, bagging 21 against Iowa State.  The Trojans’ front line needs to continue to apply pressure to the back lines of their opponents, as it will be likely that scoring opportunities will arise due to a shaky Torero defense.
The Trojans will need to take advantage of a lackluster San Diego team that has only scored 4 goals in six games this season, while at the same time allowing 11 to hit the back of the net.  The Toreros are not a second-half team, with all 4 of their goals this season coming in the first half of play.  They have been outshot 90-34 this season while also having to make more than twice the number of saves as their opponents.  While this picture might make it seem like it will be a walk in the park for the Women of Troy on Sunday, San Diego is still a team that can make a good game with elite-level competition, with their only loss against ranked opposition coming from No. 22 Texas A&M in August.
As long as the Trojans remain focused in their mission to take six points from their two road games this weekend and continue to improve on their finishing in the final third, they will return home with an impressive four-game win streak ready to start Pac-12 play next weekend.

On Wednesday, the Trojans continued game preparation for this weekend’s tilt with Texas, as they strategized for the Longhorns’ high-octane offense and focused on rehabbing key players. 
Defense prepares for high-powered Texas offense 
After practice, head coach Clay Helton pointed to the Longhorns’ 58 percent third down efficiency rate as a major ingredient for their early offensive success; they are averaging 48.5 points over their first two games against Maryland and San Jose State. On Wednesday, the defense worked against
no-huddle looks in order to prepare for Texas head coach Tom Herman’s fast-paced offense. 
“It’s a change of pace for us,” Helton said. “We go from a huddle team in Stanford to a very high-tempo team that can run a lot of plays and go extremely fast.” 
Helton excited for raucous crowd 
 On Tuesday, USC announced that this week’s game will feature the Coliseum’s first sellout crowd since 2013. Helton voiced his excitement for what should be a special environment on Saturday. 
“Our fans are so electric right now,” Helton said. “Even in the Western Michigan game the [attendance] numbers were down but that fourth quarter they produced two penalties for us with the loudness they brought. In the last game [against Stanford], it gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. That’s what you live for, to play in front of 90,000 [people].” 
Porter Gustin has surgery on big toe  
On Wednesday morning, junior linebacker Porter Gustin underwent surgery, having two screws implanted in his big toe. Helton compared the injury to the one former Trojan wideout JuJu Smith-Schuster suffered to his hand during the star wide receiver’s sophomore year. While Smith-Schuster was able to play in the same week as the procedure, going on to record 138 yards and a touchdown against Arizona, Helton noted that Gustin’s situation is slightly different. 
“He’s one of the toughest kids in my 23 years [of coaching] that I’ve ever been around,” Helton said. “If the doctors clear him and say it’s ‘OK’ and he’s able to handle the pain and not hurt himself further, [then he can play]. But if you remember JuJu’s injury, it happened on a Monday and this is Wednesday, so you’re talking about two later days.” 
If Gustin is indeed out for the Texas game (he is officially listed as day-to-day), Helton said that sophomore Connor Murphy will replace him at the outside linebacker spot.

Wikipedia pages generally provide college students with a solution to the midnight paper cram session. Robby Hauldren’s use of the site was a bit different. The 21-year-old musician, along with his counterpart, Freddy Kennett, spent hours searching articles to stumble upon one titled “Louis the Child.” They agreed this would be the name of their musical collaboration. 
A former USC student who dropped out to pursue music and half of the electronic music duo Louis the Child, Hauldren spoke at Fertitta Hall on Tuesday night as part of SC Soundsystem’s music industry guest speaker series. SC Soundsystem, co-founded by Jordan Bear and Taylor Johnson, is a student organization aimed at students interested in the music industry. The organization focuses on music journalism, informing students of innovations, artists and events. Bear and Johnson are actively promoting USC artists, like Hauldren, through SC Soundsystem. 
Prior to creating Louis the Child, Hauldren had an innate passion for music. His father and several relatives are musically talented in various respects, which he said led him to explore techno music.
Hauldren and his partner Kennett met at a music lounge in Chicago where they briefly conversed about their shared love for the music industry. Later, Hauldren found himself direct messaging those in his social network to vote for his performance spot at a local music festival. Amid the frenzy of securing votes, Kennett reached out to him with an interest to collaborate on a future project, and Louis the Child was born.
Hauldren remembers the hustle of utilizing the internet as a catalyst to all the attention they received in their early days as a musical duo. 
“I would spend hours a day messaging every blog I could find, sharing my music and encouraging people to give it a listen,” Hauldren said. 
He talked about how “unsexy” it can be for artists to remain humble, and reach out to their network to share new music. To this day, he and Kennett promote their music on platforms like SoundCloud, Spotify and YouTube, and reach out to blogs for coverage.
Despite being in an overcrowded techno genre, Hauldren and Kennett have emerged as new-age trendsetters. 
“I think it’s about creating small goals for yourself while continuing to have overarching ginormous ones,” Hauldren said. 
The duo’s impressive feats include opening for Madeon, touring with The Chainsmokers and collaborating with rapper Pell. Grinning in a sort of disbelief, Hauldren reiterated that their creations have just begun; he and Kennett still do not feel that Louis the Child has produced a signature sound yet. 
“It’s wild because I still don’t think we’ve made it,” Hauldren said to the surprise of fans in the audience. 
Regardless, he and Freddy are focused on creating sounds that deliver positive messages and are satisfied even if their art resonates with just one person. 
In the last five years, the two have played at prominent music festivals like Lollapalooza and Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. 
“I think ‘Lolla’ was my favorite so far because Chicago is home,” Hauldren said. 
As for his future musical goals, Hauldren has dreams to headline Coachella and win multiple Grammys. 
Students were eager to ask Hauldren about his personal passions, what inspires him and the specific equipment that sets Louis the Child apart. Regardless of their position in the industry, Hauldren encouraged artists and creators like himself to put in the effort. 
For Hauldren, the most calming feeling is to stand on stage and know that he’s accomplished this success for himself. After questions concluded, Trojans eagerly lined up to snap selfies and thank the artist for his constant inspiration and eclectic creations.

Exhibiting his technical mastery in front of a nearly sold-out Hollywood Bowl crowd, Grammy Award-winning cellist Yo-Yo Ma portrayed the limitless potential of a single instrument at his concert on Tuesday evening. With the prowess of a full orchestra, Ma’s solo cello performance of a series of Johann Sebastian Bach suites captivated the audience for the duration of the almost three-hour show.
Currently in the midst of a fall tour comprising seven U.S. dates and four dates in Asia, Ma’s concert at the Hollywood Bowl was uncharacteristic of all other scheduled recitals. Rather than performing with accompaniments ranging from full orchestras to a select few musicians, Ma’s performance of Bach’s six cello suites, presented by the Hollywood Bowl as part of its “Classical Tuesdays” series, is the only recital within Ma’s current itinerary in which he will perform solo. Not only are concert attendees unlikely to witness a similar performance any time soon, Ma is also unlikely to perform a similar show at any point in the distant future.
Taking the stage promptly at 8 p.m. as the house lights dimmed and the spotlights rose, Ma opened the show with a familiar piece — Bach’s Suite No. 1 in G minor. From the striking of the first note on Ma’s famed cello, the audience members knew they were in for a remarkable concert experience unlike any previously witnessed.
While the stage set up consisted of a minimalist structure — one chair, one microphone and one spotlight — this detail mattered little to the crowd of approximately 17,000 attendees. Ma’s cello arrangements, including all six of Bach’s renowned cello suites, served as an elegant soundtrack for the picturesque serenity of an evening in the Hollywood Hills. Accompanied solely by the audible commotion of crickets, Ma’s playing took center stage, holding the unabridged attention and utter stillness of his audience throughout. Although there was seemingly only one man and one instrument onstage, Ma provided a breathtaking performance on par with that of a full symphony.
Ma only spoke directly to his audience a few distinct instances — before intermission and after completion of the six cello suites — but his musicianship provided all necessary communication. Ma also expressed his undivided fondness for the pieces he performed. 
“I go back to these Bach suites time and time again as I continuously experience life,” Ma said. “These pieces have taught me compassion and objectivity, while also showing me the beauty of joy and solace.”
Closing the evening’s performance with one of his self-proclaimed favorite pieces, Pablo Casals’ “Song of the Birds,” Ma exited stage right like a preacher exiting the altar, leaving his disciples left only to ruminate on his musical sermon. Recognizing the audience’s unfettered admiration one final time, Ma expressed his sincere appreciation for the evening’s crowd, stating, “Thank you all so much for sharing in this crazy experience with me tonight.” 
As the congregation began to file out, it departed the Hollywood Bowl with just that — a crazy, unforgettable experience.

Last week, Spelman College, a historically black women’s college in Atlanta, announced that it would accept trans students applying for the upcoming school year. The decision drew relatively minimal coverage in mainstream media, but follows a contentious year of law and policy conflicts involving trans people. 
Particularly in states like North Carolina and Texas, rhetoric falsely portraying trans women as sexual predators has been used to justify legislation barring them from safely using public restrooms and gender-segregated public facilities in general. But while ferocious debate on trans people and bathrooms was erupting throughout state legislatures, gender-segregated schools have been addressing the issue behind closed doors. According to the Washington Post, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, Mills College, Smith College, Barnard College and others have moved to open their campuses to all female-identifying applicants. As of last week, Spelman is just the latest. 
The point of all-female schools has always been to create spaces for a historically marginalized group to have equal opportunity and fully embrace their identity. Today, while cis women continue to face challenges and confront institutionalized sexism, it’s safe to say that trans women face even more, and need the option of having their own spaces now more than ever. And at a time when trans women of color face higher rates of violence than virtually any other group in America, the historically black Spelman College opening its doors bears even more weight. 
Ingrained gender roles as well as ignorance and crude standards for what constitutes gender have yielded discrimination and intolerance toward trans and non-binary people in just about every layer of society, but these issues are particularly impactful in education. Harassment and bullying as well as limited access to the same resources and amenities guaranteed to cisgender students have the power to severely affect trans students’ academic performances and mental health, and the consequences can be long-term ailments like higher dropout rates and difficulties joining the workforce.
Grace Cillo | Daily Trojan
The enfranchisement of trans women starts with acknowledging and respecting their identity, and according them the same opportunities as cis women. But progress on establishing equality between cis and trans women has been severely hampered by a bizarre, right-wing narrative that identifies cis women as the victims of trans women. This is despite the objective fact that trans women are far more likely to be harassed and assaulted in bathrooms than to be the perpetrators of these incidents. By and large, there have been more documented cases of Republican lawmakers being arrested for harassing women in bathrooms than of trans women doing so, as there are virtually zero cases of the latter.
The narrative of trans women victimizing cis women has served two purposes in the agenda of conservative lawmakers. First, it’s helped them to portray their bigoted quest to make trans people second-class citizens as a noble, traditional pursuit — think Southern gentlemen rescuing hapless damsels in distress from rape and dishonor, with members of otherized groups cast as the predators. When a group is demonized, its members become exponentially easier to attack, degrade and marginalize without opposition. 
Second, the narrative is a transparent attempt to turn two marginalized groups against each other, and in doing so, weaken them both. Trans and cis women face many of the same problems in solidarity, from barriers to accessing crucial reproductive health services, to stigma and threats to their safety simply for making choices about their bodies. In both cases, cis, heterosexual, Christian white males in positions of power tend to be the ones making these rules that often dictate women’s lives. In no uncertain terms, trans women face greater and more widespread oppression than cis women do, but these groups share an ongoing fight for equality in which they must be allies to succeed. 
As more anti-trans lawmakers eventually catch wind of the great liberal conspiracy unfolding across all women’s colleges across the country, it’s safe to say they will suddenly turn their noses up to the issue of campus sexual assault — one that they tend to ignore when cis, heterosexual males are the perpetrators, as they so often are. 
But if anti-trans lawmakers sincerely cared about the violence cis women face on college campuses, they would work to reform laws and education surrounding consent, advocate for women’s rights and ultimately fight for a culture of respect toward women in all cases — rather than selectively caring based on the gender identity of the perpetrators.
A culture of respect toward women — which is supposedly the oh-so-noble aim of lawmakers who try to bar trans people from using the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity — is not one in which women are infantilized as the victims of mythical trans perverts, but are simultaneously forced to assume responsibility for the actions of their straight, cisgender male predators. For years, this narrative fabricated by the right wing has helped to attack the civil rights of cis and trans women alike — all while selling cis women on the lie that trans women, and not the cis, heterosexual white men in positions of power making these rules, are their oppressors. 
When we discuss inclusivity and women’s rights on college campuses, we cannot exclude trans women, whose courage, grit and resilience are a boon to any university that takes them in. Cis women must recognize their own privilege in these cases and stand in solidarity with their trans sisters. That has always been the spirit of women’s colleges — solidarity and sisterhood — and in today’s political climate, this must be the spirit of all colleges.

The USC Shoah Foundation Center for Advanced Genocide Research will host  the international conference, “Digital Approaches to Genocide Studies,” from Oct. 23 to Oct. 24. The two-day conference, co-sponsored by the USC Digital Humanities program, will be held on campus to provide a forum for scholarly discussions on how new methods of digital research can impact Holocaust and genocide studies.
Since its founding by film director Steven Spielberg in 1994, the Shoah Foundation has worked to create a forum for Holocaust survivors to tell their stories. Over the past 23 years, the foundation has collected a broad range of data, including thousands of personal testimonies of survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust.
Research Program Officer Martha Stroud shared how this information is used to shape the current knowledge about genocides and other episodes of mass violence through the contemporary field of digital humanities.
“The digital humanities field is this emerging field of study where people are using digital tools for humanities research, and they are inventing new methods, models and tools to analyze manuscripts and all sorts of different sources,” Stroud said.
Text mining methods are used to probe through massive amounts of text and find patterns and idiosyncrasies which may not have been previously apparent. One of the leading groups of scholars which are combining the digital humanities and genocide studies is the Holocaust Geographies Collaborative, which utilizes mapping tools and geographic information systems to represent movements of people during the Holocaust in ways not used before.
“We have collected [nearly] 55,000 testimonies — mostly Holocaust, but also Rwandan genocide, the Armenian genocide, the Chinese massacre, the Guatemalan genocide,” said Josh Grossberg, Shoah Public Communications Manager. “So now we have expanded beyond our initial scope and now we make these [almost] 55,000 testimonies.”
The interdisciplinary scholarship will allow leaders in their respective fields, scholars and graduate students to examine and provide insight into the topics addressed through these new digital tools. The conference will be the first time that the discussion regarding digital humanities and mass genocide are examined together.
“It’s not only about the Holocaust,” Stroud said. “There is also a researcher doing a paper about the Cambodian genocide, and we think these tools can be applied to a lot of genocides and the Holocaust.”
With the information collected, educational activities for schools in all 50 states and around the world inform about the impact of mass genocides in society. In addition, the conferences for the past three years have focused on relevant topics of research, including the Guatemalan genocide and the impact of Spielberg’s film Schindler’s List.
“Researchers are starting to use this massive amount of data that is in all of these interviews, to identify new trends and ask new questions that we didn’t know about before,” Stroud said regarding the advent of the new digital tools.
Among the innovations discussed, the Shoah Foundation will debut its new technology that enables people to have lifelike conversations with a recording of a Holocaust survivor long into the future. The interface allows one to ask questions and receive answers directly from a Holocaust survivor.
According to the Shoah Foundation, among the topics to be discussed by the two dozen scholars from Australia, Europe, Canada and the United States in attendance are the ethics of social media as a means of genocide commemoration and the capabilities of GIS for analyzing the Holocaust.
