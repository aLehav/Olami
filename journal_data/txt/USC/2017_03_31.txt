March could not end without one more splash of madness for USC men’s basketball, as redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron declared for the NBA Draft on Friday.
The 6-foot-7, 190-pound forward averaged 7.6 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 20.8 minutes per game this season. Aaron has not signed an agent, leaving him eligible to revoke his draft status up to 10 days after the NBA Combine in May.
For weeks, USC fans have dreaded head coach Andy Enfield’s talented young roster disintegrating one-by-one as players declare for the draft, but no one expected Aaron to make the first move.
His decision to declare for the draft might come as a surprise given the arc of his season, and, more broadly, his career at-large. 
He began the year in USC’s starting rotation but failed to win back his role despite sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright’s injury. In late January, Aaron exploded off the bench for 23 points versus UCLA at the Galen Center to lead the Trojans’ to their regular season marquee victory. He earned Pac-12 Player of the Week for his performance. However, he couldn’t replicate that performance down the stretch. In three NCAA Tournament games, Aaron averaged 7.7 minutes a game, but he failed to score.
Aaron sat out the 2015-16 season after transferring from Louisville. In March of 2016, he had surgery to repair an old pinky fracture suffered at Louisville. While with Rick Pitino’s Cardinals, Aaron appeared in 23 games and made two starts. He averaged 1.3 points and 0.7 rebounds per game.
At Rainier Beach High School in Seattle, Washington, Aaron led his squad to consecutive Class 3A titles. In 2013-14, he won Washington Player of the Year Honors and was ranked No. 26 nationally by 247Sports.com and No. 33 in the ESPN 100.

From the outside, Koutoubia looks just like any other restaurant in the Westwood area. But upon entering the restaurant, the smell of spices and incense replaces the stink of car exhaust. French-Arabic music wafts in the air, giving a mystical ambience missing in most parts of Los Angeles. The unassuming cream walls outside, similar to many other restaurants in the area, give way to an interior so exquisite, one can’t help but feel like a character in The Arabian Nights.
The walls are painted a deep red and covered in tapestries with complex geometric designs and gold embroidery. Carpets cover the floor and the ceiling is slightly arched, giving the impression that one is lounging inside a Berber tent deep in the heart of Morocco. Comfortable seats and tables circle the restaurant, giving way to a spacious clearing in the middle where, on weekends, belly dancers come to entertain the patrons.
Michel Ohayon, the restaurant’s owner, bustles among the tables to make sure that everyone is having the best experience and that their glasses are never empty. Such great service and attention to detail account for the restaurant’s long-standing reputation in Los Angeles — it has stood at the same location for nearly 40 years.

Another reason for its popularity is the restaurant’s adherence to traditional Moroccan cuisine, while at the same time adding some new items to the menu. Some of the dishes it offers include tagines, couscous, merguez or Moroccan spicy sausage and soups, as well as non-traditional cocktails, beers and wines.
Koutoubia’s most popular dishes, the Tagine D’Agneau and Couscous Fassy, utilize the Moroccan favorite: lamb meat. It is stewed in a broth of many spices and sliced vegetables until the meat is tender, falling off the bones with a single touch. The dishes come with a stack of warm bread and a cup of harissa, or North African chili pepper paste. Traditionally, they are eaten by hand, but the restaurant provides silverware for those who need them.

The only shortcoming is the absence of a dessert menu or tea selection on the menu, but that is easily amended. The kitchen is more than happy to accommodate customers’ requests, whether it is a pot of Moroccan mint tea, a stack of Moroccan sugar cookies or a plate of sweet almond baklava.
Koutoubia is located at 2116 Westwood Boulevard. It is open Tuesday to Sunday from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.

At the restaurant By CHLOE in Los Angeles, trendy eaters have the chance to grab guilt-free vegan fast food imagined by celebrity chef Chloe Coscarelli. What’s more, its location adjacent to Whole Foods means that it can be as much of a staple in your life as your weekly shopping trip!
The restaurant combines organic, natural, animal-free foods into creative twists on favorites like hamburgers, salads, pastas and desserts. I’m not vegan, but I love how flavorful and imaginative the healthy vegan dishes are.
When I went to By CHLOE last week, I tried their “Guac Burger,” which is made from ingredients that make you feel like you can give yourself a pat on the back for making healthy choices – quinoa, black beans, sweet potato, chipotle sauce and, of course, avocado. I could tell that Coscarelli takes careful consideration into how each flavor will work together in the meal. The southwestern flavors complemented each other in careful orchestration, with no flavor overpowering another.

I also tried the the Avocado Pesto Pasta and was blown away. Although I had never imagined the flavors together before, the avocado was blended into an extremely tasty, creamy sauce. Other widely popular items from the menu include the Quinoa Taco Salad and Mac n Cheese.

It’s definitely worth trying a cupcake there as well, because Coscarelli was the winner of Cupcake Wars, a competition-based cooking show on the Food Network, in 2010. She was the first vegan chef to win the show, and this helped to kickstart her career. Subsequently, she has published three cookbooks and appears often on television shows like Today in LA and The Chew. In 2014, she decided to start her restaurants in New York and Los Angeles by partnering with ESquared Hospitality and her creative director Samantha Wasser, building them with a fresh, chic and eco-friendly focus. This year, she was featured in Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list of entrepreneurs.

We made it – we are in the home stretch of school. With only a few weeks left and some big projects, papers and exams due soon it is easy to slip into a stressed mood and a negative mindset. However, do not be discouraged, because all it takes is a reminder of the importance of positivity to change your day, week and, hopefully, the rest of your semester. Therefore, this blog is dedicated to providing five places to put some positivity in your life – with a twist. 
Your phone.
Admittedly, I love social media and know firsthand that my phone is a blessing and a curse. While it may provide me with endless hours of entertainment, it can  also be a source of negativity in my life. More specifically, it is easy to compare oneself to others when scrolling through social media feeds. Remind yourself that you should never compare yourself to another person and that in many cases, happiness is different than the screen suggests. 
Your eating area.
Whether this is your desk, a table at EVK or a spot outside in the Campus Center, remember to have a positive mindset when it comes to food. As always, it is important to eat healthy, but don’t think of eating healthy food as a challenge, but rather a way to promote positivity in your life. If you eat clean, you feel clean – it is as simple as that. Incorporating healthy foods into your diet will promote a positive mindset and fuel your body with the nutrients it needs to keep your energy and spirits up.
Your mirror.
As cliche as it may sound, placing sticky notes around your mirror with some words of inspiration will actually make a difference. You don’t have to put a cheesy phrase on the note to promote positivity, but do pick an aspect of your life that you want to improve – from posting about having a positive body image to recalling a source of motivation to keep up your studies.
Your gym.
If you have been reading my blog, you know I am a huge advocate for working out, but it is not always easy to motivate yourself to go to the gym (check out my previous blog post for some inspiration!). Nevertheless, it is critical for your emotional wellbeing to get some exercise, whether it is going for a walk around campus or taking a workout class with a friend. Use exercise as your excuse to take some time for yourself in your day and don’t view it as a way to lose weight, but rather as a way to get in a positive state of mind for leading a healthy lifestyle. 
Your home.
Whether you are living with your family, friends or roommates, spread some positivity to those around you by encouraging positive behavior. The past four steps will help your personal wellbeing when it comes to promoting positivity, but now it is time for you to teach these tools to others.

New Zealand probably isn’t one of the first ones that comes to mind when it comes to cultural meccas. But in the nearly two months that I have been here, I have learned more than I thought I would about New Zealand and Maori culture.
Maori culture plays a large role in defining New Zealand, significantly larger than that of Native American culture in the United States on a day-to-day basis. The signs here are in both English and Te Reo. There are more classes offered here about Maori culture than there are at USC about Native American culture, and I’m so glad that I am taking one.

This past weekend, I learned that it isn’t just about the Maori culture for Kiwis though. I attended one day of a two-day festival, Pasifika, that was held in Auckland. It was the 25th annual celebration of Pacific Island cultural and the largest in the world. The festival featured “villages” from 11 Polynesian cultures, some of which I had never heard of — Niue and Tuvalu, to name two. I instantly recognized Fijian, Hawaiian and Samoan villages.
I most enjoyed walking around the villages that I had heard of, but have not been to in person. These were the ones where I wanted to spend the most time, learning about a culture that shares many roots with the Maori culture.
We watched several cultural performances in the Samoan, Fijian, Tuvalu, Tongan, Hawaiian and Aotearoa (Maori) villages. There was, of course, delicious food from each culture. and I left more fully satiated than I have been on this entire trip. There were also colorful booths in each village where patrons could buy traditionally made goods. Everything varied in content, but it was all being carried out by people who care deeply about the preservation of their culture and wished to share it not only with their own people, but others who are interested as well. 
The festival really got me thinking, though: What cultural identity do we pass down from generation to generation as Americans? Maori children often learn their native language and rituals, but there isn’t an equivalent for us. Perhaps we take for granted the fact that American culture isn’t going anywhere, so we don’t feel a pressing need to showcase our best act for the rest of the world.
There was something powerful in watching passion come from these nations, and it had nothing to do with fireworks or hot dogs. Everything about the festival was promoting empowerment through cultural identity. Certainly, as Americans, we have a cultural identity, but I wouldn’t be able to put on any kind of performance showcasing this.


I have been very lucky to be able to experience the culture of not just one country, but an entire region during my time in New Zealand, and it has brought to my attention many of the deficits that Americans lack in cultural areas. Of course, you don’t have to travel the world to appreciate other cultures, but being aware that other cultures exist and acknowledging the other cultures within our own country is a good way to start. I’ve been able to learn a lot about myself through studying these other cultures, and that in itself has been an extremely valuable experience. As much as studying abroad has taught me about the South Pacific and specifically New Zealand, I have learned just as much and gained as many new perspectives about myself, the United States and what it means to be an American.
