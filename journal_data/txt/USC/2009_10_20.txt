USC’s Reserve Officer Training Corps programs have seen a dramatic jump in enrollment this fall, a rise that some attribute to the stalled economy.
According to James Wise, the enrollment and scholarship officer for the USC Army ROTC, the freshmen Army ROTC class has more than doubled compared to last year.

The other branches of the ROTC — Naval and Air Force — have also noticed a similar jump. Lt. Scott Carr of the Naval ROTC said that program has seen an increase in the number of students who join the ROTC after coming to USC. Carr said there has been about a 25 to 35 percent increase among those students.
The state of the economy has some believing that finances may be the reason for the number of applicants.
“I’m sure a lot of it is because of the economy,” Carr said. “And USC is an expensive school.”
There can be immediate financial benefits to joining ROTC, as both the Army and Navy program offer full-tuition scholarships. Still, Carr said the scholarships are only added incentive for individuals already interested in joining the military, and that scholarships alone would drive students to join ROTC.
“Students who have a desire to serve their country find the NROTC scholarship very attractive,” Carr said. “It provides a means to completing a degree and the opportunity to serve as a commissioned officer in the United States Navy or Marine Corps.”
There are also long-term benefits to membership in the program. Students who graduate from college and complete an ROTC program are able to start off at a management level, or an officer in some cases, when they enter the military.
Because of the guaranteed job placement, it is typical for ROTC enrollment numbers to go up when the economy is in a rut, according to Michael Keane, an assistant professor of clinical finance at the Marshall School of Business.
“It’s not unusual to find that in a recession, people will find job opportunities in the military to be more attractive,” Keane said.
But Commanding Officer Robert Huntley, a professor for Army ROTC, said there are other possible reasons for the increase in the number of applicants.
“There’s a lot more recognition about the military … People are looking to serve the government and one of the ways is to join the military,” Huntley said,
Kevin Rohrberg, a junior majoring in history and political science, joined the Air Force ROTC his freshman year.
He said the economy might be the reason there’s been an increase in the number of students in the ROTC.
“One cool thing the ROTC has is that you have a guaranteed job [after graduating],” Rohrberg said. “It’s a great job security and it’s good pay.”
Rohrberg also has a partial scholarship from the Air Force ROTC to help him pay for tuition. But neither the economy nor the extra money was the primary reason he joined.
“It’s always been my dream to serve the country,” said Rohrberg. “It wasn’t the main reason. I mean, it obviously helps but it wasn’t my defining factor for joining.”
Whatever the reason for the increase in applicants, the higher level of interest has given USC’s ROTC program a chance to be more selective.
Though Wise said the program is currently able to accept as many or as few students as it wants, the larger pool of applicants gives it more freedom to pick and choose.
“We have a leeway to be more selective in what we’re looking for and who we want to be a part of our program,” Wise said.
Despite the economy, the Naval ROTC and Army ROTC have yet to experience any serious budget cuts for scholarships.
“We’ve been asked to continue to remain fiscally responsible and to look for ways to continue to improve our systems,” said Carr. “But we haven’t seen any scholarship cutbacks.”
Wise said the Army ROTC scholarship program has also remained consistent. Currently, students can be awarded full-tuition scholarships when they enter the Army ROTC.
The Army ROTC program is not currently very competitive, Wise said, but it has been in the past and could be again.
“We’ve had a scholarship program that’s been effective,” said Wise. “But I think that in the next three or five years, you’re going to see that full-tuition scholarship money become more competitive.”
For the record, successful completion of an ROTC program and graduation from college will result in an officer’s commission and mandatory service requirement regardless of whether a cadet/midshipman was awarded a scholarship by the military.  All ROTC graduates are given an officer’s commission which is basically the equivalent of a lower management job in the civilian world.

Two USC professors were recently accepted into the Institute of Medicine, an honor that will afford them the chance to educate professionals about life-changing health issues and bring added recognition to USC’s medical research and health policy departments.
USC’s Dana Goldman and Mark Humayun were among 65 researchers elected to the Institute of Medicine this year.
The institute — an independent, non-profit organization and a branch of the National Academy of Sciences — educates both the professional and private sectors about issues of health and biomedical science.
Induction into the institute is the highest honor in the field of medicine aside from the Nobel Prize, said Yannis Yortsos, dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering.
“Out of the thousands of doctors and other biomedical engineers in the country, Mark was one of the 60 or so. It’s a very high honor,” Yortsos said. “It’s a high honor for the university, a high honor for the school of medicine, and also a high honor for the school of engineering because Mark has joint appointment within the school and is a biomedical engineer himself.”
Humayun, a professor of ophthalmology, said he did not even know he was nominated until he received his acceptance.
“It was very exciting and a total surprise,” he said. “There are so many people in the institute who are not in your field, so you feel good because it’s sort of a validation that top leaders of other fields know about what you’re doing, and they nominated and elected you into the society. It’s a real endorsement by leaders who are not in your field.”
Humayun said he is looking forward to the institute’s biomedical studies. His focus is in applying biomedical engineering to medical conditions.
In one of his most significant projects, Humayun used bioelectronics that can restore sight to the blind. By replacing the function of the damaged retina with an electronic device, Humayun could effectively cure sufferers of macular degeneration, a condition which reduces the eye’s ability to see clearly.
Goldman, the director of USC’s new Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, also said he is honored by his acceptance. He said his acceptance into the institu
te will help his work with the Schaeffer Center.
“[The election to the institute is] a recognition that USC can be an important institute in engaging in health policy research and health economics,” Goldman said.
Humayun agreed the institute’s announcement could benefit USC, because it opens up opportunities from people who might have known the quality of work his department was doing earlier.
“Being one of the highest honors in medicine, it just raises your profile,” Humayun said.  “A lot of people who don’t know you recognize the stamp of approval of the institute. It’s an incredible stamp to have on your CV.”

A record number of USC students have submitted applications for the 2010-2011 Fulbright  program, which awards grants to students looking to go abroad to teach, learn or perform research.
This year, 63 USC students applied, according to Noosha Malek, USC’s Fulbright Program adviser. That’s 12 more than last year’s total, and more than double the number from just three years ago.

“Students can do anything from design an independent research project, pursue graduate study at a university, study at a conservatory, produce a documentary or teach English,” Malek said. “As long as the proposed project is academic in nature and specific to the country of application, they can pursue it. That openness is the beauty of the Fulbright program.”
The application process is intense. Applicants must start two months before the deadline, and their proposals undergo heavy review.
Still, USC’s application numbers continue to increase, a rise Malek attributed to USC’s success in the application process. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, USC was one of last year’s top Fulbright producers, earning eight grants.
“Success breeds success,” Malek said. “Students hear about their peers getting these awards and feel they have a chance too.”
Despite the school’s past success with the Fulbright program, Malek said it’s difficult to estimate how many grants USC will be awarded this year.
“The number does fluctuate,” Malek said. “There are many factors at play.”
The strength of a student’s application is important, Malek said, but sometimes the popularity of the country they are applying to can be just as important.
Last year, 405 students nationwide applied for grants to go to the United Kingdom but only 13 grants were awarded. On the other hand, 54 students applied to go to Korea and 15 received grants.
“The message is not for students to avoid a country because of the numbers, but to be aware that competition is a factor,” Malek said.
Jeanette Acosta, a 2008 USC graduate, applied to the Fulbright Program last year and received a grant to perform research in Mexico.
Acosta said she had known about the Fulbright program for a while, but did not consider it until later in her academic career.
“By the time I was a senior, my friend got a Fulbright,” Acosta said. “Knowing someone made it more tangible and real, I asked myself, ‘Why didn’t I give it a try?’ And it was worth it.”
She is currently in Mexico at the Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas studying how education among children affects migration.
Jack Tseng, a graduate student working on his Ph.D. in biology, received a Fulbright grant that allowed him to travel to China in 2008 to go to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and do hands-on paleontology work with Chinese fossils.
“I’d always wanted to spend time abroad because it would broaden my education,” Tseng said. “It didn’t come through as a possibility until the Fulbright.”
Unlike most Fulbright grants, Tseng’s wasn’t for a social or political science.
“They don’t usually fund science projects,” Tseng said. “But I really needed to be there to see the material if I wanted to do anything with it. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without the grant.”
Tseng and Acosta agreed applying to the Fulbright Program was the right decision.
“It’s a long process with lots of steps but it’s worth it,” Acosta said. “It’s always worth applying and putting the best application forward if you’re really passionate about something.”

Even from a hundred yards out, nobody could mistake Wes and Shane Horton for anything except brothers.
Wes, the younger defensive end, might stand four inches taller than his slightly more human-sized linebacker older sibling, but both brothers wear the same curly hair and bright smile.
Brotherly love · Defensive end Wes Horton (96) is at ease knowing he has his older brother Shane on his team, and sometimes in the same huddle. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Looking beyond their physical similarities — and differences — Shane and Wes Horton act just like brothers. Separated by a mere 18 months, the siblings even sound similar. Both pepper their speech with “you know,” and, more tellingly, repeatedly refer to their time together as Trojans as a blessing.
“It’s stuff you dream about,” Shane, a redshirt sophomore, said. “Being able to play under Coach Carroll, being able to play at home and also being able to play with my brother. I’m living the dream. And I cherish every moment.”
While redshirt freshman Wes has been a regular starter this season, USC’s game against California two weekends ago marked Shane’s opportunity to join his brother in the starting lineup, a chance that arose out of the injury to linebacker Malcolm Smith.
For the two siblings out of Chatsworth, Calif., it was their first chance to start together since their playing days at Notre Dame High School.
“Back in high school, we started together basically every game,” Wes said. “It was very exciting and not everyone gets that opportunity.”
However, the start in Memorial Stadium was actually not their first time on the field together as Trojans. Shane fondly recalled the Washington State game, their first time playing together since 2007. Shane smiled as he remembered that both brothers were so lost in the game that finding each other in the huddle came as a mild shock.
“I remember we were huddled up in a TV timeout and Coach was talking to us and I was tapping Wes, saying, ‘Wes! Wes!’ and he had barely even noticed I was out there and he looked back and said, ‘This is it!’” Shane said.
Except for some hard work and a fortunate transfer, such a wonderful moment might never have come to pass. Shane, who graduated high school in 2006, chose to attend the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he had a stellar freshman season at starting linebacker.
Separated on and off the football field for the first time since birth, Shane and Wes faced some difficult choices as the younger brother approached his own high school graduation.
“It definitely sucked,” Wes said, bluntly. “I was leaning towards UNLV in the beginning, but things didn’t really work out. Obviously, when he came to USC, it was just a blessing to have him here.”
Fortunately, Shane transferred from UNLV, and after an NCAA-mandated year off, the siblings were finally able to play together again.
Though they play different positions on defense, Shane and Wes found important little moments of symmetry and teamwork between them during the Cal game.
“We go to the same side every time just based on our positions, so there’s a few plays where I got to tap him on the butt and tell him to go left, tell him to go right,” Shane explained. “So it’s cool, I give him a little tap, and he knows it’s me every time.”
Although senior defensive captain Taylor Mays said he didn’t necessarily see any signs of “brotherly love” on the field, he praised the way both brothers have prepared individually and together.
“Both of them are stepping up, stepping in,” Mays said. “They’re mature and they’re dedicated, and it is important to them to play well. It’s important to them to do well for the guys around them.”
Defensive coordinator Rocky Seto praised Shane’s performance in his first start against Cal, also remarking that the brothers’ start together might have been the first of its kind at USC since Mike and Marlin McKeever played together in the early ’60s.
“We felt really pleased the way he performed and executed. He had a big hit, and I thought it was pretty neat that both were out there,” Seto said.
Coach Pete Carroll echoed Seto’s praise for the performances of Shane and Wes against the Golden Bears, and also commented on the rarity of their opportunity.
“That was really cool. We were supposed to take a picture of the three of us but never got that done — blew it off at the end,” Carroll joked. “Those guys are really well-liked around here because of their work ethic and the way they handle themselves, and the guys were rooting for them.”
Despite his strong performance against Cal, Shane was unable to win the starting spot from a healthy Smith against Notre Dame last weekend. True to Mays’ assessment of his selflessness, the older Horton showed little concern for the decision.
“The only thing I can do is come out here and bust my tail every play,” Shane said. “We’ve got two other guys who are really good and can fill in that spot. So it’s also good — it’s going to make us better — that we’re all competing against each other.”
Rather than gripe about the starting lineup, both Shane and Wes, who remains a starting defensive end, seem content to play their positions and improve to the best of their abilities. And, after that long separation, the brothers mostly just seem happy to be together again as Trojans.
“That’s why I came back over here, just to be with him,” Shane said. “It felt like something was missing, you know, we’re attached at the hip. That’s my best friend. I love that guy and it’s going to be hard being away from him. So we’re going to stay together as long as we can.”
And even though the brothers said they rarely argue over their performances on the field, sometimes a little competition off the field is inevitable.
“I would say the only time we do argue and bicker is in video games,” Shane said, laughing. “We won’t fight over food, we won’t fight over anything else — but video games, I guess it just comes down to competition.”

Quarterback Matt Barkley might only be a freshman, but his performance Saturday against Notre Dame put his name in the Heisman conversation.
The true freshman made his first appearance on a poll Tuesday from HeismanPundit.com, which surveys 13 Heisman voters from around the country who vote for players on a 5-4-3-2-1 point scale. Barkley’s recognition comes after a career-best performance Saturday, where he threw for 380 yards and two touchdowns.
Heisman hopeful? · Matt Barkley’s 380 yards and two touchdowns against Notre Dame got the attention of some Heisman Trophy voters. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Barkley said he was surprised by the news, but that he hadn’t spent much time thinking about the award.
“I’m just taking one game at a time … I don’t plan on [winning the Heisman] this year, but if it does, then it’d be sweet to get the chance to go back to New York,” he said. “But I’m not even thinking about that. It’s not on my radar right now.”
Barkley’s three points earned him a spot among the likes of Florida quarterback Tim Tebow, who led the first eight weeks’ worth of polls, and Alabama running back Mark Ingram, who took the top spot this week.
“I know there’s a lot of other quarterbacks who will have played better, but I think with the level of competition we’ve played, maybe that’s why they’re considering it,” Barkley said.
Barkley has thrown for 1,338 yards and five touchdowns — along with three interceptions — this season. He is undefeated in his five starts, including road games at Ohio State, Cal and Notre Dame.
“He’s a very interesting situation, you know, a freshman quarterback here at ’SC and doing well and winning all the games he’s played in so far,” USC coach Pete Carroll said. “He’s a guy that’s going to catch somebody’s attention.”
—
Junior tight end Anthony McCoy also turned some heads after Saturday’s game.
McCoy was the Trojans’ leading receiver against Notre Dame, where he had five catches for 153 yards. Barkley connected with McCoy early in the game, and continued to find him for large gains.
“I was in a nice little rhythm after that first catch in the first quarter and the coaches told me to be ready,” McCoy said.
McCoy caught a 60-yard pass from Barkley in the third quarter, and dragged multiple Notre Dame defenders along for additional yards before being brought down at the 15-yard line on a play that set up a USC touchdown.
“His threat down field is, I think, unmatched by a lot of college athletes and tight ends,” Barkley said. “But the way he can run vertically and just has the knack for catching the ball and finding that open window — it’s huge.”
McCoy credited the play calling for his breakout performance, and said he would be ready if the coaches called on him again.
“I’m just going with the flow right now. If they’ve got plays set up for me they do, if they don’t, they don’t,” he said. “I’m just here to play football.”
Much like Obama, If he wins, he should not accept the award.  You need to accomplish something first.
Brakley may be the next two time winner of this award.

I swear it was a scene out of a movie.
South Bend, Ind. Population 108,000.
Getting off the freeway in South Bend, you enter this fantasy world where everything revolves around college football.
Now, I knew Notre Dame was supposed to be one of the best places to visit in college football and, by all accounts, a true sight to see — even a mecca for the sport, if you will.
But this? I could’ve never imagined it.
A short 90-minute drive from Downtown Chicago takes you across a time zone and into another world. You take the Interstate 90 from Downtown, paying about seven bucks in tolls along the way, and suddenly, just off Exit 77, you encounter a line of cars stretching to — you later find out — Notre Dame Stadium.
I’m pretty sure every car I saw had some type of Notre Dame insignia on it.
And in the midst of that line-of-all-lines, you slowly drive through a couple streets, some with suburban houses bordering them on each side. There’s another college, a high school. They look nice.
You’re at least a mile and a half away from the field, but scores of people stroll the sidewalks on each end.
And the trees. The trees look like they were Photoshopped to be perfect colors — blends of orange, red and brown sticking out in my mind.
You know that Brett Favre commercial for Wrangler that seems totally unrealistic, where they play in a huge grass field and look all happy? Take out Favre and substitute another Notre Dame fan, and I witnessed it. People toss the football around in almost every driveway or yard.
Then there’s the stadium.
Touchdown Jesus is certainly a sight to see, and the Golden Dome is beautiful. But the biggest thing to me was the manner in which I — a visitor — was treated on the Notre Dame campus.
I’ve never felt more welcomed in my life.
I must have heard the words “Welcome to Notre Dame,” at least 30 times from ushers and elevator staff to random old guys on the sideline and the woman serving the broccoli and cheddar soup  — when I asked her if I should pick the cheesy concoction or the “Texas Chili,” she told me  the soup was so good it would make me want to slap my mom.
So there’s a rivalry between USC and Notre Dame, but, as I discovered firsthand this weekend, it’s not the same rivalry we’ve grown accustomed to. There’s true mutual respect between the two teams.
USC has a rivalry with UCLA. I’d say Cal, too. We don’t like them and they don’t like us.
It’s different with the Fighting Irish.
There was one key moment that demonstrated this to me.
I spent the majority of the game standing on the Notre Dame sideline, around the 20-yard line. There were four or five guys around me that seemed to be huge Irish fans, truly devastated when McKnight ran the ball in to make the score 34-14 in the beginning of the fourth quarter. But even as their spirit seemed to die out, they kept watching.
And then, as you know, the Irish made a dramatic late-game comeback. With nine seconds left, it almost looked like they could win.
The guys were excited, of course, albeit nervous. During the review of the would-be final play of the game, they were confident that they would get another chance.
They did, of course. And I’m sure that those guys thought Notre Dame would pull it out, beat USC for the first time in eight years, and get to celebrate.
But the telling thing was what happened when junior quarterback Jimmy Clausen’s throw fell incomplete and the Trojans rushed the field, celebrating victory.
The guys clapped.
Even in a time of pure devastation, they supported their school with pride and class.
Now, certain things in life are hyped up to be a lot more meaningful than they actually are.
But there are a few that exceed the hype, those select few events that surpass your own already-inflated expectations.
And South Bend was definitely one of the latter.
Color me impressed, Golden Domers.

I am an undergrad Domer, and as soon as I graduated I headed to USC to study film.  Though you’re only 19 once, I do respect and love USC.  If we didn’t play them, I don’t think I would have even gone and checked them out.  I’m so glad I did.  It is a fabulous school.
I made an amateur DVD of the weekend (50 mins).  It shows the Golden Dome, the Basilica, Fair Catch Corby, the Grotto, the band concert in Front of Bond Hall (Fight Song, Alma Mater), the players marching to the Stadium after Mass (Golden Tate, Jimmy Clausen), warmups, the pregame Band Concert (USC and ND), America the Beautiful, The National Anthem, the ball brought by Army paratroopers (Special Opps) during the National Anthem,  the runout of the teams.  Then the game, shot from the 50 yard line, just the highlights, Half time show by ND band, that last push, the last play (last 54 secs, it was close, 34-27), The Alma Mater, The Fight Song, and then the all important USC cheerleader show (15 Min.  Most ND fans never even know it happens).
If you go to http://www.ebooks2die4.com (600 to chose from) and buy a $2 book (paypal only) and leave me a message and I’ll send you the DVD.  My pleasure.  Copying allowed, but please no publishing.
Also, I guess you all know that the ND USC game is in Godfather II.
Thanks for telling me where Knute Rockne is buried.  I’ll put it on my tour next time.
I’m an ND grad and want to thank you for this article.  I love the USC game – I’m consistently impressed every two years by the number and enthusiasm of the incoming ‘SC fans.  That’s a lot of dedication to fly halfway across the country for a football game!
If you’re in for the game in 2011, and can make it out even earlier, I recommend visiting the gravesite of Knute Rockne out at Highland Cemetary.  A group meets every year before the USC game (8am, I believe) to pay a tribute to the coach and hopefully wake up some echoes and shake down a little thunder.
Glad you had a good experience.  Good luck on the season.
Thanks for the great article. I am an usher of 27 years. (no old man though, 48) This game is our game of the year. I look forward to it like my kids look forward to Christmas. SC fans are a class act. No one ever gives us grief, just respect. It makes it easy to welcome them. Boston College fans on the other hand. I need not say any more. I am not a huge fan of SC, my dedication is to ND, but I am a  bigger fan every time they come to town. Good Luck with the rest of your season.  “GO IRISH”
As a Notre Dame Usher I love to hear how we helped make the experience more memorable for every fan, home & visitors alike.  I can tell you that I take great pride in making people feel welcome & important to the university & I genuinely hope everybody has a great time at each & every home game & comes away as in love with the experience as I am.  That passion for the experience is what drove me to want to dedicate my Fall Saturdays to Notre Dame football & donning the gold cap & jacket, taking tickets & saying “Welcome to Notre Dame!”
Side note in response to an above comment – I’m hardly an “old man” usher at age 35.  Go Irish!
Well, this Domer is all verklempt now. Thanks for your kind (and true) words! We pride ourselves on showing visitors, no matter whom, a great time. We welcome you back anytime. GO IRISH!
Thank you for writing this article.  As a double-domer I swell with pride knowing that visitors, even rivals, experience the same larger-than-life saturdays as Irish fans.  Best of luck on the rest of the season.
My friend Jim says, “I can’t wear Crimson”! What’s that all about? haha
Enjoyed reading the article. Glad the gentleman had a great experience. I may have to make the trip up there sometime with my big ND friend Jim Oppman.  Roll Tide!
Very well-written and accurate article.  My multiple gameday experiences at ND have all been indelibly memorable and pleasurable.  I’ve heard similar reactions from fans and writers from many other universities.  ND people are indeed classy and treat visitors extremely well.  You don’t always get that welcoming feeling everywhere else…  Plus the campus in late October will knock your socks off, it’s so beautiful.
As a recent graduate, allow me to say that South Bend may be a pleasant place to visit the 7 days a year it hosts a college football game but it’s not so great the other 358 where it’s a symbol of rust belt decay.  Drive in from Chicago in February when it’s 5 degrees out, it’s snowed for 10 straight days and the roads still haven’t been plowed and tell me how awesome South Bend is then.
There is always someone who can find the glass half full.
My kids have gone to both schools and although USC fans are not unfriendly, they’re not welcoming either.  I LOVE all the old men ushers who keep saying “Welcome to Notre Dame”.  There is mutual respect between the two schools but Notre Dame wins in the friendliness department!
PS  I was at the Ohio State game this year in my USC t shirt  and altho one person cussed me out as I walked by them, another congratulated me on the USC victory as I walked out of the stadium.
Great article. I made the trip myself with 2 other guys from Buena Park, CA . WE meet up with 5 other guys for a tailgate party. The entire Notre Dame experience is unbelievable. THE BAND, When the Band roared by me the first time, if felt like a runaway fright train. I got choked up, and my buddy was crying. If you love Collage Football, like my crew and I do, Notre Dame HAS to be on your Bucket List.
Great article…  As an ND student, it is great to hear feedback like this.  We try to be intimidating and welcoming all at the same time.  Look forward to our visit to y’all’s home turf next year!
Thanks for this GREAT article.  I am a lucky ND alumnae who had the privilege of spending the weekend with amazing ND friends of 25 years and watching a fabulous game.  Your sincerity and appreciation of the experience is admirable.  Thank you for keeping an open mind and good luck with your writing career!
There’s a university that could learn a thing or two about class from Notre Dame and their initials are UCLA.  It was a great game this year unlike the past few years; almost gave me a heart attack, but it was fun to watch.  I hope to visit their stadium one day.
I agree that for the most part Notre Dame fans are a very classy bunch.
I had great conversations with their fans before and after the game (which says a lot after a loss).
I had to comment on the Ohio State fans though. I was also honored to attend this game, but had a terrible experience.
I could not walk 15 feet without hearing an insult or comment about our team or our school. I did not take it personally but I would say what makes the difference in a team’s treatment of other fans is a two main factors.
The first is the overall culture of the fan base. This can range from a party atmosphere where the other fans are strictly enemies, to a fan base where the game is an experience and an opportunity to meet great new friends (I would say we are the later but like to party hard as well).
I think the second is what kind of rivalries your school has had. If you are a school who has rivals that you constantly mingle with, such as ND whose fan base travels really well, or USC and UCLA who is in close proximity to other schools  and fans you tend to be not as intense. If the school is far from its rivals, and there tends to be a monopoly of fans in their area I would say that lends to a more harsh fan base since they don’t interact with other fans as often (ex: the state of Ohio and Ohio State being the end all team there for college football).
I have always touted out fans as being very nice, and although some of our fans are not, we should work toward being noted as the best fans in the land. What all of us can do is be models of this in our own right and tell those obnoxious fans to cut it out and be courteous to all other fans!
Yes, it’s true, ND people do live up to the hype.  I’m a ND grad.
My youngest son, Joe, graduated from USC in May of this year.  It’s also true that USC people live up to the hype.  I have become a fan of both schools.
While attending a game at USC his freshman year, I walled through the tailgate lots while wearing my ND hat.  I was welcomed by USC fans to food, drink and many great stories.  I was truly impressed.
Clapping in the Midwest for both teams.

Nice article. I actually experienced the same thing when I went up to Ohio State. I guess the people in the midwest were brought up in a better way.
i ran into some pretty rude people at Ohio st all weekend. I got the feeling they didnt like us at all. I felt the people at the Auburn game were more welcoming…AFTER the game.

When Mel Brooks thinks about comedy, he often recalls the blunt words of grammatically incorrect wisdom from Greek actor Andreas Voutsinas, who was featured as Carmen Ghia in the 1968 version of The Producers.
“Andreas would say, ‘Or you got it, or you ain’t,’” Brooks said, impersonating Voutsinas’ thick accent in an on-campus Q&A session last Friday. “That son of a bitch was right.”
King of comedy · The legendary Mel Brooks spoke to students last Friday at the Jack Oakie and Victoria Horne Oakie Masters Lecture Series, where Brooks was awarded the Oakie Foundation Award in honor of his vast career. Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Spaceballs are among his films. - Photo courtesy of Steve Cohn
But when you’re Brooks — an audacious, unabashed and incredibly prolific comedy writer-director-actor whose career spans five decades and is comprised of a slew of enviable distinctions, including an Academy Award, three films ranked in the top 20 of the American Film Institute’s list of the top 100 comedies and two highly successful Broadway show adaptations — it’s easy to say that being funny is an innate ability.
The iconic funny man behind The Producers, Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, to name a few, displayed his comedic wit with ease when he appeared before a packed audience at Norris Theatre for the Jack Oakie and Victoria Horne Oakie Masters Lecture Series. Now in its second year, the series brings acclaimed filmmakers to speak with students and also honors the work and legacy of actor Jack Oakie, who appeared in an impressive 87 films in his lifetime.
During Friday’s event, Brooks — flanked by his long-time entourage that included producers Michael Gruskoff, Jay Kanter and Alan Ladd Jr. — was presented with the Oakie Foundation Award for his excellence and dedication to comedy.
“[Oakie and Brooks] share many talents: versatile, irreverent, but most of all, very, very funny,” said  School of Cinematic Arts Dean Elizabeth Daley in her opening speech.
That last talent was apparent from the moment Brooks stepped onto the stage for his moderated discussion with Writing for Screen and Television division chair Jack Epps Jr., candidly remarking when deciding which chair to sit in, “I have a good side and a bad side.”
Epps persuaded Brooks to begin with his early life as a sickly boy growing up in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y., where you were the odd one out if you weren’t Jewish.
As if almost by default of living in New York during the ’30s, Brooks became enamored with musical theater at 9 years old, when his uncle took him to a performance of Cole Porter’s Anything Goes. Although Brooks soon found a home in television (Your Show of Shows, Get Smart) with some practice, good fortune and a friendship with Sid Caesar, he maintains that his showbiz dreams are cemented in theater, and his most recent endeavors — adapting The Producers and Young Frankenstein for Broadway — fittingly bookend  his vast career.
But despite his talents for lyricism, composition and television writing, Brooks will forever be remembered as the man who turned Adolf Hitler into a LSD-loving hippie, cowboys into gas machines and Darth Vader into, well, Rick Moranis.
Though it was The Producers that captured him an Oscar, Brooks believes the 1974 monster parody Young Frankenstein is the “best” film in his extensive repertoire. Securing monetary backing for the movie, however, was an arduous process, as Columbia Pictures initially viewed Young Frankenstein as a risk.
“I told Columbia, ‘I’m going to make this in black and white.’ There was silence. They said, ‘You’re kidding! Peru just got color. Bolivia just got color. Spain just got color … We’re not going to make this in black and white,’” Brooks said. “These are, no offense, movie executives. They’re just thinking in terms of loss and profit … So we stuck to our guns and said no to Columbia Pictures.”
One late-night phone call to Ladd at Twentieth Century Fox put Young Frankenstein back in motion and ultimately sealed Brooks’ comedic genius status. Brooks’ attributes the success of Young Frankenstein to the fact that — besides lending his voice as the cat that gets pummeled by a cart — he did not act in the film.
“I wasn’t in it, so I didn’t have to worry about myself. I could concentrate on the beautiful cinematography and the incredible sets,” Brooks explained. “For me, it was a cinematic triumph.”
Although the phrase “cinematic triumph” seems out of place when juxtaposed with a contemporary broad comedy, parody or farce, Brooks’ seemingly silly yet extremely observant films continue to resonate with audiences even decades after their release — and that’s saying something.
“You have to love the genre you’re parodying,” Brooks said. “It’s better to have a picture with some purpose. You can’t just write antic comedy.”
While Brooks’ writing, themes and subjects of parody are often viewed as the high points of his films, Brooks understands the value of casting the right people and acknowledges that many of the laughs in his movies radiate from the interplay between the actors on set.
“It comes from the talent that you’re with. Writing is never written on the page.” Brooks paused and then corrected himself, chuckling as he realized the irony of how perfect his own comedic timing was.
“Timing is never written on the page,” Brooks continued, receiving a chorus of laughter in response.
Discovering, honing and cultivating this timing is a hard feat for many. But when you’re Brooks, life never ceases to be a setup waiting for its punch line.
“When it comes to comedy, there’s no teaching [and] there’s no schools,” Brooks said. “It’s magic.”
Mel Brooks, you’re an idol! Meeting you at the Rita Hayworth Commissary during my Hollywood visit to help unveil the star for Cole Porter–is a highlight for me.
Come to Peru, IN–birthplace of Cole Porter! My alltime favorite so far is Blazing Saddles..long may you bring laughter to this often sad world.-jck

There is a stereotype that those who are into the Internet do not get out much. This Monday, about 550 new media creators and aficionados defied that stereotype when they came together for a night of discussion, networking and entertainment at Busby’s East on Wilshire Boulevard.
Tubefilter News’ Hollywood Web Television Meetup connected a wide range of new media creators, producers and fans. The monthly event — capped off by a networking mixer — was organized by Tubefilter News, an Internet television news and industry review website. Co-founded by USC alumnus Brady Brim-deForest, the company works to connect independent web creators and strengthen the network between them.
On air · Tubefilter News, a leading provider of episodic web TV, hosted a mixer Monday night to discuss the future of live streaming. - Young Kim | Daily Trojan
“The core of our strategy is what we call ‘ecosysteming’ — a year and a half ago, the web television space didn’t really exist as a defined content vertical,” Brim-deForest said. “We saw an opportunity to build out an ecosystem around a core group of content creators. The Streamy Awards, as well as the International Academy of Web Television, have helped to propel high quality series, and those who create them, into the spotlight. The success of one show means greater audience awareness for the space and more attention on web television as a medium.”
This month’s panel, Going LIVE!, was a look into the growing popularity of live web shows and the work that goes into making them. In a relaxed atmosphere, guests mingled before the show, chatting with panelists and each other.
After calling everyone to their seats, Brim-deForest introduced the panel.
“Welcome to the ninth Hollywood Web TV Meet Up,” he said. “This has really become a great tradition of awesome parties with awesome people.”
Brim-deForest then turned the event over to the panel’s moderator, and Tubefilter News Editor in Chief Marc Hustvedt, who then introduced the panelists. The speakers included Hailey Bright (co-host of the video game web series Coin-Op TV Live), Brian Gramo (founder of theStream.tv, which airs more than 10 live shows a week), Tyler Crowley (executive producer of Mahalo Daily, an Internet television company), Bismarck Lepe (founder of Ooyala, a company that designs live video streams) and Drew Baldwin (a co-founder of Tubefilter, and producer of the Streamy Awards).
Hustvedt then introduced the guests from Stickam.com, another live streaming company that was broadcasting the panel live.
“We’ve never done this live before, but that’s why we’re doing it,” Hustvedt said.
Hustvedt got into the questions quickly, with the most direct first: “Why did you decide to go live?”
“There is this great site called Music Plus TV, and they went live. I thought this is cool, we could do something like this with experts in different fields like videogames or movies,” Gramo said. “We started in my apartment doing two to three shows a week, but we grew and soon we had to get a studio.”
“We started to go live to see how people would react,” Crowley said. “The audience really liked it, and the sponsors caught onto that and grew. They found that they can really make money off a live stream, so that’s why we’re doubling down on live shows.”
Hustvedt turned the topic over to the benefits of doing a live show, specifically the interactive element of it.
“On our show we have a guest every week, and that guest can really connect with the chat room,” Bright said. “It’s pretty neat, you could be a kid in a small town, and all of a sudden you can ask your favorite video game designer whatever you want.”
“We did the Streamy Awards live, a lot of people don’t know that,” Baldwin said. “It was pretty insane to try and do that, but we wanted to make it appropriate to the audience, we wanted them to be able to see the event, and we can get an audience globally, so we went with it.”
The conversation then steered toward the business side of live web streams, specifically sponsors.
“Sponsors want live,” Lepe said. “It’s the easiest way to interact with the customers and the audience. Live is here, and it’s only going to grow.”
Baldwin added, “What we offered sponsors with the Streamy Awards was an event. A live stream is an event on its own. Our website had only been up for just over two months, but we had over 40,000 people tune in for the show. If you put the word out to the internet community, it will spread like wildfire.”
“Who here has a DVR?” Gramo asked. “Who here fast forwards through commercials? You can’t do that with a live show. Sponsors can’t ignore an opportunity like that.”
After a few more questions, Hustvedt then turned the discussion over to the chat room, with the first question asking the panelists what the hardest part of producing a live show is.
“The hardest part is the first show,” Gramo said. “There are a lot of crap talkers who live to shoot you down. ‘It’s his first episode? I’m going to take him down!’”
“At least they’re watching,” Baldwin chimed in, earning some laughter from the audience.
Following the panel, the chairs were cleared away and the crowd doubled in size for the mixer.
Topics ranged from the panel to individual web projects. The informal, party-like nature of the event continued, and many of the panelists were casually chatting with guests and fans.
“The evening had a really excellent vibe,” Brim-deForest said during the mixer. “It’s all about the quality of the folks that come out and it always exceeds my hopes. The community makes the event.”

Over the past week, White House representatives have really been taking pains to make sure we know all about the war.
Not the war in Afghanistan, of course, or the situation in Iraq. Those can wait. No, I mean the other war the Obama administration is fighting: the war against Fox News.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Because, obviously, that’s the one we care about most. I mean, people’s feelings might get hurt — and seriously, what could be worse?
Uh, pretty much everything — fights overseas that are killing American soldiers, for one — but no bother. Obama’s officials are being criticized, and clearly that takes precedence.
Thus, instead of a substantive national debate over war strategy in Afghanistan, we’re getting oversensitive White House staffers bellyaching on air about Fox News like a boohooing bunch of snobby kids. They sure have their priorities straight.
Of course, the logic of their position is deeply flawed to begin with. For instance, if Fox News is an illegitimate news organization — as Obama’s chief of staff and a number of his other political aides (incorrectly) believe — why should its views matter in the first place?
The White House’s clear intention is to delegitimize the network, but, by drawing more attention to it, they are doing the exact opposite. Not surprisingly, Fox’s ratings are up a reported 20 percent since last year, according to a recent article in the New York Times.
Surely turning a deaf ear to Fox News would have been a wiser, and no doubt more effective, strategy. Often the best policy is one of utter disregard. Most of us would rather be criticized than ignored. At least if we’re criticized, somebody cares.
This war, impolitic as it is counterproductive, should make us angry, but it doesn’t because we like the drama. We like the fiery back-and-forth between Fox personalities like Glenn Beck and Bill O’Reilly and White House heavyweights like Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod. We shouldn’t.
It is immature on the part of both parties — but especially Emanuel and Axelrod — to take up a sizable chunk of the national conversation with chaff of this inane sort.
Let us examine briefly the charges made against Fox News, in an effort to expose their pettiness, immaturity and general stupidity. To begin with, most administration officials do not believe Fox is a news organization, because it has a perspective.
And the New York Times and MSNBC — neither of which are at war with the White House — do not? For weeks, the New York Times would not acknowledge the Acorn scandal. Is that not a perspective? It was the editors’ choice — right or wrong — not to assign reporters to investigate charges of corruption within this national organization, whereas Fox News did.
Both news organizations gave their perspective. This notion of Fox alone having a perspective is sheer humbug, and Emanuel and his staff ought to be ashamed for making such a lame excuse.
Some take it a step further, saying Fox News is opinion masquerading as fact. Also lame. These might be facts with which administration officials disagree, or otherwise wish would go unsaid, but they are facts nonetheless, carefully researched and investigated like the rest.
This might sound like a defense of Fox News — it is not. No one can deny its conservative slant, much as no one can deny MSNBC’s liberalism. This is a critique of Obama’s political lollygagging, this ridiculous distraction from infinitely more important items on the national agenda. The White House will lose this foolish war against Fox News, for reasons obvious to all but its frontline fighters. Why waste any more time?
There is no easy answer to how the White House should interact with the media, but under no circumstance should it actively campaign against it.
In other countries, we take governmental interference in the media to be a sign of corruption, do we not? Obviously, the White House is not interfering at this point, but merely questioning — but to what end? There is nothing that can be gained, and a lot that can be lost. Obama’s priorities — seriously out of whack since Copenhagen — need quick reevaluation. Fox News shouldn’t even make the list.
This is one war Obama will surely lose. He should be working on winning the real ones.
Jason Kehe is a sophomore majoring in print journalism. His column, “Small Wonder,” runs every other Wednesday.
I agree that it would hav been more wise for the WH and the president to simply ignore Fox News, just like Bush and the WH at that time ignored CNN, MSNBC, NY Times, and the whole gang of “mainstream media.” Denying press access to just one media outlet is censorship. We need to worry if that is what this president wants to do. I also find it laughable that Obama said his staffers were the ones who are complaining about fox – not him. I also find it laughable that his Pay Czar made all those salary cuts (whether you agree with them or not) without his knowledge. Everytime Obama wants to take a stance on a controversial issue he just has one of his underlings take the flack. What else will Obama conveniently not know about? How can someone in his position not know what his administration is doing?
Now when the white house and president decide to call out the only major conservative news outlet it is okay.
But if a conservative president called out MSNBC for their opinions all hell out break loose.
Lets see what happens when the next conservative president comes into office.

It’s kinda like the presidency going after FOX News -a way of directing attention away from the truth of the matter, which is incompetency within the White house. And, it’s really easy to understand what the writer was saying when he said “Surely turning a deaf ear to Fox News would have been a wiser, and no doubt more effective strategy”… It’s a true statement from both a social, and psychological perspective.
Good article.
I think that the president and White House should focus more energy on Fox News and less on stripping the populace of their money and civil rights.
Blech, this article is a mess.  I used to really like reading the Daily Trojan, too.
I know it’s an opinion article, but saying things like, “Because, obviously,” “Uh pretty much,” and “I mean”  is amateur.  I’m sure the writer does not want to come across as a snotty kid, so it might help him to write in a slightly more sophisticated manner.
These articles are best when the writer, regardless of his or her side of the story, uses clear logic.  I have a hard time believing some of what is written because it does not make sense.  The part, “Surely turning a deaf ear to Fox News would have been a wiser, and no doubt more effective, strategy” is flawed.  Ignoring a problem does not make it better.  Just ask your doctor.  Recognizing and treating the problem is the general procedure in eliminating it.
Overall, I completely disagree with the entire premise of the article, but I try to keep an open mind to other people’s opinions.  Thank you for taking the time and energy to write it, but next time please try and do a better job coming off as a mature writer.
Indeed. And for all those journalism students out there–take note. Fox News is doing the job that journalists are supposed to do. News flash: Journalists shouldn’t be in bed with the administration, or Congress, or the Courts… they shouldn’t be “buddies.” Journalists in Washington shouldn’t be courting the folks in the halls of power; there should be a natural adversarial relationship (friendly but adversarial) — and that is SADLY lacking since Obama moved into the White House.

What is it about a child that makes truth a fluid, flexible thing?
When I was a kid, I was lied to. A lot. I was gullible, impressionable and, in all honesty, my mind was like Play-Doh — easily molded by whoever got their hands on it. Was I weak in character? Was I an introvert passively living a life of deceit? Maybe — but that’s beside the point.
I did this, you did this, and I’m sure that random person you almost hit with your bike today did this. We ate it up. Teachers, parents, the fifth-graders who conquered the back of the bus — these were all sources of authority that we never thought to question.
Why yes, there were monsters in our closets. Christopher Columbus was an adventuresome, completely wholesome man who had the cahones to discover a new world. And Santa Claus, he was a jolly man with a white beard filled with secrets and magic.
I once asked my first-grade teacher why she taught us lies — particularly about colonialism. Until I hit puberty, I was taught — no, I fervently believed — that Columbus was a hero, a role model. He might have worn strange pants that ballooned like a skirt, but at the end of the day, he crossed an ocean with a mere three ships and opened the door to another half of the world.
I thought the same of the pilgrims, those brave, compassionate victims of religious tyranny who made friends with the Native Americans and built a civilization with these peoples at their sides.
Then, puberty hit — and with the horrifying, newfound revelations I had to endure about my changing body, I was also hit with another dramatic truth: History is violent.
She confessed to me that all first-grade teachers glorify the past to their students because the realities of history would demolish the innocence of adolescence. I feel like this method is, however, largely counterproductive. The false sense of security and pride in these historical figures undoubtedly causes more shock when one realizes the lies inherent in these projections — or was that just me?
In any case, kids are dismissed as naïve and silly. And we certainly were, to a very large extent. I believed that double dog dares were law, that smooching conceived babies and that a mother’s kiss could actually relieve pain. I even had a childhood friend who tried to convince me that little elves play pranks on you as you sleep, which is why you could never find matching pairs of socks and your colored pencils were always misplaced.
These mistaken notions were the result of an overactive imagination — but these ideas also persisted because of aforementioned authority figures. My parents never tried to teach me trivial life lessons by having a friend with one arm provide numerous traumatic experiences (is it true that an Arrested Development movie is, cross my fingers, one step closer to fruition?), but they did encourage my beliefs in the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny and the photogenic arena of Santa’s lap.
Yes, we have proven that children are naïve and silly. But the crazy thing about children is that they can see beauty like no one else can; they can see brilliant flashes of art and the resounding echoes of rapture in completely unassuming situations. Case in point: The Wall Street Journal performed a study about the perception of art in unsuspecting places. They hired Joshua Bell, one of the most beloved contemporary violinists of our time, to play his violin in a dingy metro stop. During the entire afternoon, he made $32 — but the only people to stop and stare and listen, even for a few moments, were children being urgently pushed and pulled by their parents.
It is a careful line, admiring a child’s pure innocence and beating the naïveté out of him or her. Purposefully shredding the truth of reality only creates ignorance in a mind already gullible to apparent, misleading “truths” constantly bombarding it. But I say that, at the end of the day, children are the ones who are unashamed to open themselves to new possibilities. They are the ones who might see the world through fantastical, ridiculous lenses — but they can also see the world as it truly is: a space infested with malicious intent and dark corners but, despite all the shadows, as a space also filled with wonder.
When we were kids, we were awed by the shapes we saw in the clouds and the sheer exhilaration we felt when cruising on a speeding bicycle. Don’t you think life is better when clouds and bikes are awe-inspiring to you, too?

In the past two months, there were two massive protests. People marched in the conservative Tea Party parade and voiced their opposition to proposed government spending for areas like health care and supposed “socialized medicine.” A throng of gay rights activists also marched in the capital in support of reforms allowing gay marriage. The former was disseminated in the popular media while the latter was reported almost as a footnote.
Despite popular opinion, the mainstream media has long been bereft of opinions considered too far to the left. The far right, however, has had a steady voice in easily accessible news for some time, culminating in the current popularity of Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh because of their rallying cries against President Barack Obama.
On the other side, MSNBC has recently come on the scene as a more liberal TV news network, but it doesn’t openly embrace leftist labels like “socialism.”
According to recent poll data from Rasmussen Reports, 20 percent of Americans now prefer socialism to capitalism, 27 percent were undecided and 53 percent prefer capitalism.
The data is even more striking for people under 30: 33 percent preferred socialism and 37 percent preferred capitalism.
That one in three young people in this country don’t have their views represented in major media is striking, and that is not considering the 30 percent who are undecided.
In the early 2000s, journalists started being labeled as “liberal.” Joe Conason, a national correspondent for the New York Observer, recently stated, “The tendency of the mainstream media [is] to fear the right. They don’t fear the left… in the same way that they are afraid of being called ‘liberal’ by the far right.”
This trend has been around for years and has the slanting effect of keeping news reporting in general away from stories that may have a leftist viewpoint.
For instance, the reporting over the last year on the financial crisis has focused overwhelmingly on banks and businesses and only marginally on issues that directly affect many more Americans, like housing foreclosures and unemployment. The Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism recently looked comprehensively at around 10,000 reports on the crisis between Feb. 1 and Aug. 31 in 2009.
The study found that 40 percent of the coverage looked at the banking and auto industries, whereas only 5 percent of the stories “tried to explicitly examine the broader impact of the economic downturn on the lives of ordinary Americans.”
The media focus on business is unfortunate but not surprising. Practically every major media outlet in the United States is owned by a large multinational corporation. These corporations naturally have their own interests that select, color and occasionally distort media coverage.
Take the aforementioned parades. Big business and their media have little financial interest in reporting on gay rights; it’s not profitable. Reporting on Tea Party parades against government programs like the proposed public health insurance option, on the other hand, draws negative attention to an issue that threatens large insurance companies.
Despite the drab state of American mainstream news, there are praiseworthy news sources out there if one cares to look. The Real News is a web-based, video journalism organization that depends exclusively on viewer donations. The Real News thus circumvents potential conflicts of interest by not accepting funding from advertisers, governments or corporations and offers genuinely leftist journalism.
Al Jazeera is an independently-owned organization and, although it still garners 40 percent of their revenue from advertising, one wouldn’t tell it from visiting their English-language website. Al Jazeera offers a liberal-leaning and distinctly foreign perspective on the world and issues in the United States that is less caught up in domestic corporate and partisan concerns.
Most importantly, though, to those who care about current affairs and wish to hear out informed, leftist perspectives, do some research and find a reliable news source that suits you. In today’s complex political climate, it is unfortunate that a third of this country’s young population has to make considerable effort to find agreeable views in the media, but it is necessary to maintain the balance of opinion that is urgently needed.
If the trend of socialist views among young people continues, who knows, maybe one day CNN or the New York Times will have an in-house socialist commentator.

Marketers know that college campus’ are one of the few places in the world where a specific and highly coveted demographic is concentrated in one small place. Moreover, they know this demographic is very receptive to free things.
POM was on campus today, handing out free iced coffee beverages to passers by. Caffeinated substances are particularly popular amongst promoted products at USC (remember when Monster was here?), presumably because college students are assumed to be constantly stressed and in need of stimulants. Which is true.
Imagine if it were legal to pass out other things college students are stereotyped as loving: we wouldn’t be able to get Natural Light spokespeople off our backs.
When it comes down to it, college students will take just about anything that is being given out for free. I know Jews who go to Christian meetings for free pizza, and there are people who buy memberships at Costco so they can float around there on the weekend eating samples of Hot Pockets.
If Pom had been handing out freeze-dried prune casseroles, they probably would have gone like hot cakes. Or Hot Pockets.
FOLKSIE:  Here’s some “FREE” Money (but it’s not like “Free” Hot Pockets at Costco –  you have to work for it).  The iOme Challenge is a contest for US College Students to redesign the US Retirement System:  $20,000 first place prize plus a trip to Wash DC to present winning ideas to policywonks.

It was water, not fire, that closed down The Lot for most of the day Monday.
Director of Hospitality Kris Klinger said a fire alarm went off in The Lot’s kitchen area around 2 p.m. Yet, it was not the alarm itself that shut down The Lot’s restaurants, but the water from the sprinklers that accompanied the alarm.
Klinger said the sprinklers rained water in the The Lot’s kitchen, forcing the kitchen to shut down until health officials cleared the area.
Though the restaurants serving cold food were able to reopen quickly, those that needed access to the kitchen remained closed throughout the day.
Klinger said the university asked health officials to continue working on The Lot into the evening to help ensure all restaurants would open as planned Tuesday morning.
“We insisted the health department come back tonight,” Klinger said Monday.
Even though the closure was temporary, Klinger said it was detrimental.
“It definitely hurt The Lot’s business,” he said.

For a short time in September, Sarah Hinojosa was the center of several Viterbi students’ attention.
Sarah Hinojosa, a senior at Blair International Baccalaureate Magnet School in Pasadena, has Down’s syndrome. This year, she was a subject of a disability-themed “capstone project” — a mandatory senior design project that engineering students at USC have to complete before graduation.

The students were using the project to understand the daily difficulties for people living with disabilities, and  will make recommendations to improve their lives.
Encouraging disability-oriented research, such as the study of Sarah Hinojosa’s everyday activities, is one of many initiatives currently being undertaken by the University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities to incorporate disability awareness into university-wide instruction.
“We try to infuse disability content into courses at USC,” said Barbara Wheeler, associate director of the USC UCEDD. “We do lectures and social work; we co-taught a course on disability for social workers.”
The USC UCEDD has two major aims: to provide non-medical treatment and therapy to developmentally disabled community members, which primarily takes place at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, and to seek out the next generation of disability-related professionals and caretakers.
“It’s very important that [college] students …  focus on disability,” said Sarah’s mother, Olivia Hinojosa, of her willingness to see her daughter participate in the study.
The students followed Sarah Hinojosa for a day, watching her carry out daily activities. At one point, while walking back from the grocery store, Sarah Hinojosa, who is in choir and loves to sing, began to practice for an upcoming performance.
Her one-on-one aide, who assists her on a daily basis, had uploaded the lyrics to a song — Michael Jackson’s “Heal the World” — to Sarah Hinojosa’s mobile phone. The USC students were worried that Sarah Hinojosa might have difficulty operating the T-Mobile sidekick, but Sarah appeared to use the phone with ease.
“They were able to clarify with Sarah and her one-on-one that she was able to navigate this size of equipment,” Olivia Hinojosa said.
She said typically people with developmental disabilities are unable to use small equipment.
The center is hoping projects like the Viterbi students’ and other efforts from universities across the nation can help increase knowledge of disabled populations and also inspire possible innovation in the future.
“The idea was that if these children were going to be moving into the community — that was the long-term goal — that they would need to have a cadre of professionals who were skilled at working with these children and their families,” said Dr. Marion Taylor Baer, director of the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program within the USC UCEDD. “And since they have complex disorders, this needed to be an interdisciplinary team.”
Baer’s LEND program readies graduate and post-graduate level students from varied academic backgrounds for positions of leadership in disability-related professions.
“Our main purpose is to promote systemic change in our state to help people with developmental disabilities,” Wheeler said.
In its efforts to increase the interaction between researchers and people with special needs, the Center is hoping it will be able to spur enough innovation to help improve the everyday lives of people like Sarah Hinojosa.
Olivia Hinojosa said its important for students to interact on a personal level with people like her daughter. Only then, she said, can they see what types of technology developmentally disabled people have the most and least trouble operating.
“It was just one of those little, opportune moments,” Olivia Hinojosa said. “Who would’ve thought they were going to stop and practice to sing, and that they would see her navigate on this small phone?”
This gives hope to every ATO.

Good fences make good neighbors, the saying goes, but at USC, being a good neighbor often means taking down those fences.
The university was recently ranked the top “good neighbor” in a national survey of colleges and universities — tied with the University of Pennsylvania — but USC officials and community members agree the university must continue to break down barriers between itself and the community.

“It stems from the president’s community initiatives, which touch on education, safety, housing for USC employees, economic development and hiring,” said Cheryl Dionaldo, managing director for USC community engagement and education. “The entire university is really committed to enhancing the quality of life of the people who work, live, study, worship and play around our neighborhoods.”
The survey was released as a part of the report, “Saviors of Our Cities: A Survey of Best College and University Civic Partnerships,” led by Evan S. Dobelle, president of Westfield State College. This is the second time Dobelle has released a survey concerning civic engagement at universities — the first was published in 2006, with USC again landing at the top of the list — and serves as a re-evaluation based on the economic recession.
To determine the top 25 universities for the list, Dobelle studied a series of criteria including the school’s length of involvement with the community, the amount of money invested, faculty and student involvement in community service and recognition of the school’s presence within its community. USC has long touted its student and faculty outreach programs and its investment in the community.
“At USC we don’t just say we’re doing this much for the community around us, but the actual funds that go to finance those programs come from USC faculty and staff,” Dionaldo said.
Members of the community agree the university is taking the right steps. Shawn Simons, president of the North Area Neighborhood Development Council, believes that the university works hard to understand the needs of the community.
“That’s really the best way for the university to go,” she said.
But Simons, who lives off Normandie Avenue, believes the university needs to make its outreach programs better known within the community.
“Their biggest obstacle is getting the word out so everybody knows about those programs,” she said. “There is some unrest in the community about the relationship, but I think those people don’t really fully understand the extent that USC has taken with their different programs.”
Daniel Wu, an outreach coordinator for Campus and Community United, said he is proud of USC’s No. 1 ranking but believes this should prompt university officials and students to continue their efforts.
“This is a milestone to push USC to go above and beyond,” said Wu, a senior majoring in interdisciplinary studies. “Now we can think of new ways to approach community issues.”
Wu cited employment opportunities and increased affordable housing as two initiatives that USC should take to the next level.
“As a campus, we really can’t be afraid to think about larger community problems,” he said.
Many of those larger community issues will come into focus in the next few years as USC moves forward with its Master Plan, which includes rebuilding the University Village and creating more student housing.
One problem already plaguing the community is education. With the Los Angeles Unified School District’s programs lagging, USC has stepped in, partnering with a network of 14 schools ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade in the areas surrounding the University Park and Health Sciences campuses.
Through the collaboration with these schools — known as the USC Family of Schools — the university provides funding and support for academics, tutoring, after school programs and college-readiness programs.
“Due to that partnership, we have so many opportunities for our children,” said Sue Becker, magnet coordinator for the K-8 school at the 32nd Street/USC Visual and Performing Arts Magnet School. “We have so many fantastic things offered to us because of the outreach and community partnership that USC has with the school.”
The university has helped the magnet school provide its students with dance and music classes, science activities and specialized tutoring, but Becker said that the most important aspect of the partnership is the commitment of USC students.
“Everybody is just so thoughtful and considerate,” she said. “It gives the students the opportunity to know someone who is in college. Knowing that, it gives them an understanding that college is available to them and that they too can get there.”
For Simons, student involvement is the key to eliminating the remaining fences between the university and its neighbors.
“The more USC can partner with the community and educate them about their true passion for the students to be civically engaged, the better off everyone can be,” he said.

Students looking to buy or sell books, furniture or housing online have an abundance of options, but USC’s Undergraduate Student Government is attempting to make the process safer and more streamlined with Tommy’s List, an online classified ads website designed specifically for USC students.
A Trojan version of Craigslist, Tommy’s List allows only students with a “usc.edu” email address to post and respond to classified listings.
“We loved Craigslist’s simple ideology and clear-cut categories,” said Chris Cheng, USG’s director of outreach. “We wanted that but just for USC students, so that we can have a safe market place — something for our own little niche.”
USG’s communication department created Tommy’s List for students to safely buy and sell books, electronics, tickets and other goods within the USC community, and to make all transactions on campus, with no shipping costs.
“It’s such a great idea, you can look for anything from jobs to internships,” said Paige Hill, the senior director of communications for USG. “It just makes things easier for students. It’s not as broad as other sites, you can know who you’re buying from and you don’t have to drive far.”
Cheng also suggested that the site could be an alternative source for students to buy secondhand textbooks.
“People will still go to bookstore but they do run out of books a lot,” said Cheng. “This is a way to make a more convenient change for the students if they don’t want to pay a store price and want a trusted seller.”
Though the site was created in the spring, USG only recently began publicizing it.
“After the [student government] elections last semester we never got to have a huge promotional push,” Cheng said. “And this year I was wondering whatever happened with that site. I brought it up and it worked and was good to go, so we started the campaign this week.”
USG plans to continue to promote the site, which currently contains about a dozen listings, through fliers and promotional boards.
But with websites such as Craigslist, Uloop and Facebook marketplace, some students question whether Tommy’s List is necessary or effective.
“It’s a cool idea but I’m not sure how viable it is since Craigslist is available and massive in its scope,” said John Hervey, a senior majoring in political science. “I probably wouldn’t use it.”
Other students, however, said the exclusivity of Tommy’s List would be a welcome safety measure.
“That’s a great idea, I would definitely use it, especially for schoolbooks,” said Cheyenne Pierce, a graduate student in the School of Social Work, who said she already uses other online classifieds sites. “Craigslist is too broad. This sounds more safe, especially for a lot of the freshmen who are not from this state and don’t know the area.”
It’s good idea for USC students which very useful for them to enhance them selves
Excellent stuff !
:)
Could be interesting way to sell stuff because it is super local and with people at the school, but seems like you would get better exposure posting your items on other venues as stated.
It is nice to have a site were spammers do not clutter up the listings and you can deal with only other students!
