In effort to make El Centro Chicano more inclusive, the Central American Network at USC started a petition Monday to modify the Latinx resource center’s name.
The term “Chicano” refers to people of Mexican descent who live in the United States. For this reason, the Central American Network believes it does not encompass all Latinx student identities that are a part of the organization at USC. Photo from El Centro Chicano.
CAN at USC’s petition asks that “Chicano” be removed from the organization’s title in order to encompass the variety of cultural identities within the Latinx community that do not fall under that term.
“We’ve seen the changes that other organizations have made at USC, including the Latino Student Assembly changing their name to Latinx,” Nathalye Lopez, co-president of CAN at USC said. “There are so many students who don’t identify with Chicano, including Latin American students.”
Lopez said that CAN at USC had been planning to start this petition since last year, but finalized it with the organization’s leaders during a retreat this January. She also said that the club has met with Billy Vela, director of El Centro Chicano, in the past about the upcoming petition.
At the time of publication, the petition had reached around 150 signatures, according to Lopez.
The term “Chicano” was originally used to describe people in the United States of Mexican descent. Many Mexican-Americans took pride in the term after the Chicano movement, which helped end ethnic stereotypes and foster solidarity, according to the petition. 
El Centro Chicano has previously acknowledged the debate regarding the name. In their 2012 handbook, they mention that the name Chicano has never been universally accepted by mainstream society or the Latino community. The name remains “in tension with other identity labels for reasons connected to different views on assimilation and acculturation in the U.S.,” the handbook read.
Grecia Vega, a junior studying economics who is involved with El Centro Chicano, found the potential name change appropriate for the sake of inclusivity. Vega said that her and other students involved with El Centro Chicano have supported the petition.
“The students at El Centro are very involved,” Vega said. “I could imagine it came from a place of progress and the need for unity in the Latino community. Sometimes its title doesn’t mean well and drives its community apart.”
The petition explains that the center was formed at USC in order to foster “the principles of the Chicano Movement: inclusion, pride, and democracy.” 
“This is not in an effort to attack or diminish the Chicano culture or movement, rather a method to add diversity and inclusiveness to what and who El Centro Chicano represents,” the petition stated.
The petition is still in circulation. Vela did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Leaders of the news media industry gathered at the “Free Speech through a New Lens: Film, Digital Media and Social Change” panel held at Wallis Annenberg Hall on Monday.

Panelists included David Linde, chief executive officer of Participant Media; Shabnam Mogharabi, chief executive officer of SoulPancake; Martin Baron, editor of The Washington Post; and Josh Singer, the screenwriter of Spotlight and The Post. 
Frederick M. Lawrence, an expert in free expression and hate-crime law, moderated the event. 
The conversation focused mainly on the role of news media in democracy, as well as what the First Amendment means in a digital context. Baron said that most other forms of news outlets, such as television and radio news, get their stories from newspaper reporting. 
“You find that the stories that we do become the genesis for public conversation more than stories done by anybody else,” Baron said. According to Baron, the goal of newspapers is to provide a forum for public conversations and to elevate that conversation.
Baron acknowledged that the nature of the press has expanded to include media companies and digital platforms.
SoulPancake, a site that creates “uplifting content” such as Kid President, a motivational video series, is one of these new media companies. Mogharabi spoke about the role of the SoulPancake when it comes to censoring user-generated content. 
“We tend toward the side of not censoring,” Mogharabi said. “We try to guide it but we definitely do not actively censor unless we’re seeing foul language or threatening language. We don’t want to prevent people from exploring that clash of ideas, even if we disagree with them.”
Singer agreed that free expression is important in the public sphere. He emphasized the importance of the press — especially the local press — in today’s world. According to Singer, if there is no strong local reporting, corruption may go unnoticed.
“The press is so important to keeping our leaders honest,” Singer said. “There is a reason that the fourth estate exists and that is to keep another check on power.”
Lawrence said that a system with neither repression of speech nor censorship may be the best. To him, speech should not be repressed, but there is a moral obligation to respond and counter.
“Doing journalism is an exercise of the rights provided us in the First Amendment,” Baron said.
According to Baron, the First Amendment is not just a set of guiding principles, but a call to action. He said that the principles journalists practice are what have kept him in this profession for over 40 years. 
“As journalists, we’re trying to tell the truth, actually,” Baron said. “That’s the purpose. We’re trying to be the expression of the First Amendment in the modern day.” 
Citing former president James Madison, Baron said the purpose of the First Amendment is to hold the government accountable by means of an independent entity outside the three branches of government. That entity is the free press, he said.
“So that’s what we’re trying to achieve — to try to tell the truth about what’s happening in our government and our broader society and around the world,” Baron said. “I think that most people in our profession are deeply dedicated to that.”

Standing beside a table bearing a vase of red roses, ABC’s The Bachelor host Chris Harrison spoke at Wallis Annenberg Hall Monday, sharing his experiences in the television industry.

Harrison came to USC as a guest speaker for students in the “Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society” journalism course. In his talk, he acknowledged that he was at a place in his life where he had the age and experience to give advice to a room full of college students.
Growing up in Oklahoma City, Harrison initially had no interest in studying journalism, or hosting, much less becoming a television personality. 
“My goal in life was to play soccer,” Harrison said. “I wanted to go to college through soccer. That was my end all be all.”
Harrison’s dream changed during his junior year of college when he was approached to be a sportscaster for basketball games. After delving into sportscasting, Harrison realized he had a new passion and changed his career focus. 
“As soon as I did it, that was my drug,” Harrison said. “I was addicted. That was my passion. If you know me, when I love something I go into it. That’s it.”
Following college, he landed a job based on his knowledge of the Dallas Cowboys. He eventually moved out to Los Angeles, where he discovered a love for producing and television hosting.
Regarding his one of his most popular television shows The Bachelor, Harrison spoke about the show’s efforts in incorporating diversity into its casting. Harrison said that the show felt pressure from media outlets for years to cast a black bachelor or bachelorette but that the producers were waiting for the right person to assume the role.
“ABC gave us the time to do it correctly,” Harrison said. “It was important to have the right person, man or woman, earn their spot and be popular.”   
Harrison discussed claims that The Bachelor had “taken a step back” in diversity with its current season featuring a white bachelor, previously having casted the show’s first black bachelorette. Harrison refuted this, saying the show has had a history of casting people of color to make sure viewers feel represented. 
“What is important to me is people,” Harrison said. “When they don’t see themselves represented on television, they don’t feel included.”
According to Harrison, the audience at home ultimately determines the direction of the show. The Bachelor is more socially relevant now than it was when it first premiered, mainly because of its presence on social media, Harrison said.
“We have the most educated, affluent audience in television,” Harrison said.
Harrison answered the audience’s questions about how The Bachelor fits into the #MeToo movement. He said that it takes steps to ensure the safety of its contestants by hosting a “consent camp” and other initiatives. 
He addressed the handling of the controversial last season of Bachelor in Paradise, in which a contestant was accused of sexual misconduct. Harrison said that he and the other producers removed both contestants to give them the benefit of the doubt and find out the truth behind the scandal.
“We’re so quick to judge people,” Harrison said. “The news is so quick to put a name out there.”
Harrison said that a successful television host must be natural on camera. He found his “vibe” by getting in front of it as much as possible. He also learned to push himself to reach for different opportunities, which led him to get casted in The Bachelor and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. 
“My mantra in life has been, ‘What would you attempt to do if [you] knew [you] could not fail,’” Harrison said. “I don’t always succeed, [but] the failure in life is not giving yourself a chance to succeed.”
Senior Joseph Salvato, a senior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism and cinema and media studies, agreed with Harrison’s sentiment and found his openness with the audience refreshing. 
“Normally, [interviews with] entertainment people [seem] very guarded,” Salvato said. “He just gave a very open and honest, all-encompassing interview.”

To increase more communication between the University and the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, Andrea Hodge, vice provost for undergraduate programs, disclosed more information regarding the program’s structural changes in a memorandum released last week to Topping scholars and Governing Board members.

The memo emphasized the importance of upholding the traditions and activities in the Topping Fund, such as luncheons, banquets and retreats. Additionally, Hodge said that the Fund’s scholarships, “exceptional” funding and travel grants will remain in place as “we work together in building a NTSAF for future generations of undergraduate and graduate scholars.”
Alongside assistant vice provost David Glasgow, Hodge asked for the Topping Governing Board to develop a “strategic plan” to chart the future of the Topping program. 
“Creating such a plan is critical for an organization, and I will be asking some faculty colleagues with expertise in this area to assist us,” Hodge said in the memo. “Your input is absolutely critical to this effort.”
In the coming months, Hodge, Glasgow and the Topping Governing Board will be discussing a finalized strategic plan for the program. In the memo, Hodge said that her office will be focusing on reviewing original documents from the Topping Fund “to maintain its vision and mission” and will receive input from members in the Topping program and both Undergraduate and Graduate Student Governments when finalizing the plan. 
Hodge said that the plan, which will be developed throughout the semester, will include policies and procedures for graduate student selection and programming for future expansion. This plan, she said, will be implemented for the next five years and beyond.
“Once the strategic plan is completed and approved, we will emerge with a stronger and expanded program which can serve many more deserving, eligible students and result in many more hours of service to the surrounding community,” Hodge said in the memo. “I will be working with the [Governing Board] to set up listening sessions to gather your input on the strategic plan.”
Topping scholar Sabrina Enriquez, a senior majoring in mathematics, said she was relieved to see the second memo as she felt it demonstrated increased communication and transparency.
“In my previous meeting with her, I really emphasized how communication has been terrible and it all seems very opaque, so I was at least happy that something went out,” Enriquez said. “Just the fact that something went out is good.” 
However, when it comes to Hodge’s idea of a collaboration on the strategic plan, Enriquez said that many scholars are “a bit skeptical,” as one of the most significant changes made to the Topping Fund — Christina Yokoyama’s removal as Topping director — was finalized without the Governing Board’s consent. 
“It seems to a lot of people that there already exists this grand plan that we aren’t privy to,” Enriquez said. “People have very little hope about the Governing Board making a strategic plan that will genuinely be used. I’m trying to take things at face value, and if she says that they will be working together, then I’d like to believe her.”
In the memo, Hodge invited the scholars to meet her at the biannual faculty-student luncheon, which will be held on March 28. 
“I look forward to getting to know many more of you as we work together to continue the successes of this program,” Hodge said in the memo. “I very much share your commitment to the NTSAF.”
With this strategic plan, Enriquez said that it is unclear if the Governing Board, the administration or both will be in charge of making most of the executive decisions. 
“I think everywhere should always have a strategic plan, every department, every fund,” Enriquez said. “So it’s not really a question to me if there should be a strategic plan … However, I’m concerned about who is ultimately making the decisions because it’s clear that the Governing Board has a shift in its power, and that’s the unsettling parts of the changes.”

On Feb. 8, the city of Los Angeles unveiled the newest addition to the streets of Downtown: six bright orange homeless donation meters, which funnel passerby donations to homeless outreach programs that provide mental health, medical and housing resources to the homeless.
Yet, these conspicuous meters equipped with smiley face emojis may raise more questions than funds or awareness. For one, do these meters actively encourage more Angelenos to donate to and grapple with the mounting problem of homelessness? Do they provide any means of engaging with and facing L.A.’s homeless crisis? And if Angelenos can support more quasi-parking meters, why can’t they support the construction of more affordable housing?
The homeless donation meters attack only one facet of the equation: the lack of adequate funds to fully tackle homelessness. The next hurdle — which concerns how to resourcefully and effectively put more and more public dollars to full use — requires more public support and creativity than mere additions to the sidewalk.
With the rise of the “Not in my Backyard” movement, which often opposes new developments in residential neighborhoods — even with the tens of millions of dollars already garnered by Proposition HHH and Measure H, respectively — the struggle for physical space and public support persists. And with San Pedro and Venice residents fighting not only housing, but also proposed storage units for the homeless, concerns continue to grow over where money and housing units can be allocated across the city. Los Angeles is composed of diverse populations with diverse desires, but also with regard to pressing questions of public policy and morality.
In one sense, these donation meters perpetuate the same “NIMBY” mentality. Angelenos can support housing for the homeless, just not in their backyards, with financial support through putting coins in a meter. But homeless individuals  remain out of sight and out of mind.
Fortunately, encouraging news emerged the day after the debut of donation meters, when the Los Angeles Times reported on the City of Los Angeles revising plans to convert public parking lots into affordable housing.
In the midst of a car-buying craze in the post-World War II years, the City of Los Angeles bought 119 public lots to accommodate its gas-guzzling economy and residential culture. But the city launched a public effort to divert drivers to public transportation and an increasingly unaffordable housing market, leaving little space for more development. Now, the conversion of these lots represents a more economically and otherwise feasible, long-term approach to housing low-income renters and the homeless. Yet, the city must grapple with lost revenue from the loss of parking meters, and concerns over changing quality of life in neighborhoods where these lots would be transformed.
Los Angeles can also tap into the collective creativity and resources of the private sector, especially schools such as USC, where architecture students pioneer tiny home projects similar to micro housing units proposed in San Jose. These innovative homes, though they are often temporary fixes, possibly provide much-needed, cheap and accessible roofs for the thousands of unsheltered Angelenos.
This focus on new units reflects the growing influence of the “Housing First” homelessness assistance model, in which securing the human right to housing comes as a prerequisite before integrating other services, such as job-training and mental health treatments. The hope remains that a roof over one’s head can not only initiate but also facilitate the transition off the streets and into a home,  as well as rehabilitation and other necessary services.
Just a few weeks ago, over 6,000 volunteers hit the streets to tally our homeless neighbors, and though data has yet to be released, little hope lingers after the last Homeless Count found a 23 percent uptick in homelessness in just a year, raising L.A. County’s homeless population by a whopping 57,794. Coupled with recent trends in homelessness data and ever-rising rents with the recent closing of the Santa Ana riverbed homeless encampment, and Los Angeles expects another surge in its unsheltered population.
In the midst of this housing crisis, Los Angeles must couple growing resources with growing resourcefulness to addressing homelessness. As citizens of Los Angeles, we too must grow not only their donations and sales taxes, but also their consciences and collective awareness. In the City of Angels, Angelenos may not live in heaven, but every one of them deserves to live in a home.

The Trojan track and field team arrived in South Carolina with high hopes over the weekend as they prepared to compete in the Tiger Paw Invitational hosted by Clemson. 
As a member of the women’s 4x400m relay team, sophomore Anna Cockrell and her teammates completed the race in 3:02.23. Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
The men’s team entered the meet ranked No. 15 in the nation, while the women’s held the No. 4 spot. Neither squad disappointed. They put up their most impressive showing of the season thus far, dominating in events across the board. The Trojans totaled seven wins over two days of competition, and most impressively of all, set a new world record.
The men’s 4×400 relay team — comprised of freshman Zach Shinnick, junior Rai Benjamin, senior Ricky Morgan Jr. and sophomore Michael Norman — won in spectacular fashion as they set a new IAAF world indoor record in their win with a remarkable time of 3:01.98. The race was the fastest ever recognized by the IAAF, breaking both collegiate and international records. The No. 2 Florida team also broke the previous record, making for a truly historic race.
The women’s 4×400 relay team didn’t fail to impress either, finishing 4.5 seconds ahead of the second place team in a dominant victory. The team of sophomores Kyra Constantine and Anna Cockrell and seniors Deanna Hill and Kendall Ellis ran a 3:02.23, the fifth-fastest time ever in the event. Hill also won first place in the women’s 200m dash with a facility record time of 22.82 while Ellis placed third with a time of 22.99. Ellis did manage to secure a victory, running a 51.57 to win the women’s 400m dash.
Freshman Twanisha Terry impressed in the women’s 60m dash, running a blazing 7.23, a new PR. Redshirt junior Ky Westbrook followed up in second place, running a season-best time of 7.25. In the men’s 60m, sophomore Alexander Barnum placed second on a strong performance that saw him post a PR of 6.61. Cockrell placed third in the women’s 60m, setting a PR with a time of 7.96. Sophomore Michael Norman won the men’s 400m dash with a time of 45.00 seconds, breaking the school record for the event. 
Redshirt senior Breana Jemison threw for 16.88m in the women’s shot put for a second place finish.  Senior Randall Cunningham secured an impressive victory in the high jump, not missing a single jump until the 2.26m, which he would clear on his second attempt to win the event. Redshirt senior Eric Sloan won the triple jump, setting a facility record in the process; his winning jump measured in at 16.23m. 
The Trojans’ season has begun as well as they could have hoped for. They’ve impressed in every week of the season so far, steadily displaying improvement as the season kicks into gear, with the Tiger Paw Invitational as their best performance yet. 
Junior heptathlete Lyndsey Lopes, who set a PR in the 60m hurdles at the meet, gushed about the great team atmosphere.
“To be surrounded by amazing athletes who uplift and push one another is a true blessing,” Lopes said.
They will need to sustain and build upon their success, as they begin the first week of the MPSF Indoor Championships on Feb. 23.

In its first true test of the early 2018 season, the USC women’s water polo squad took down each of its four opponents in the UCSD Triton Invitational in La Jolla over the weekend.

While the Women of Troy had already racked up three impressive wins — the team outscored opponents 59-3, including two shutout wins — on the season heading into this tournament, they knew that this performance would truly set the tone for their 2018 campaign.
“What is the most impressive about this team so far is their unity,” head coach Jovan Vavic said. “Leadership is the key and our captains are leading in and out of the water.”
Through the first day of group play, it was business as usual for USC. Taking down Sonoma State and No. 18 San Diego State 13-1 and 14-2 respectively, the Trojans remained a dominant force just as they had been through three games. 
In both games, the USC defense was absolutely spectacular, holding both teams scoreless until late in the fourth period. Thanks to an impressive combined effort from goaltenders senior Victória Chamorro and junior Amanda Longan, who both notched double digit save outings, the Trojans allowed only 3 goals on the day. Offensively, freshman driver Paige Hauschild led the way for the squad, picking up 4 goals in both games including a first half hat trick against Sonoma State.
“She’s one of the best young players, not only in the country, but in the entire world,” Vavic said. “For [Hauschild], the sky is the limit”.
While USC found smooth sailing through its first two matches, they were tested greatly in Sunday’s elimination round matches against No. 7 UC Irvine and No. 4 UCLA.
With Chamorro back in net for the Trojans, the team fought an up and down battle against the Anteaters. Fighting on with only a slight lead throughout the match, Chamorro helped close the door with 13 saves. Building off her first two games, Hauschild again led the squad with two goals while captain Brianna Daboub picked up her 100th career goal on a critical first-half strike. Senior utility player Annika Jensen notched the seventh and final goal for USC, clinching a 7-5 victory and a date with crosstown rival UCLA in the finals.
In the championship match late Sunday, USC never once fell behind the Bruins. Putting the cherry on top of an incredible tournament, Hauschild again led the Trojans with two more goals while Daboub had a couple key scores of her own. The turning points of the game came on penalty tries both teams earned in the second and third periods respectively. 
While Longan came up huge in stopping UCLA’s attempts late in the first half, USC’s sophomore driver Denise Mammolito was successful in her attempts in the third. This 2-goal swing gave the Trojans all the momentum they needed to finish off the Bruins and take home their fifth-straight Triton Invitational Championship.

Over the weekend, the women’s basketball team swept Arizona and Arizona State for two critical wins to push their record to 17-8 and their conference record to 7-7. The two wins will be crucial to the Trojans’ bid for the NCAA tournament in March.
Junior guard Aliyah Mazyck scored 24 points in the Trojans’ Friday night game against the Sun Devils. Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan
On Friday night, the Trojans faced off against No. 25 Arizona State and emerged victorious with a 77-62 triumph over the Sun Devils. Despite giving up an 8-0 run to start the game, the Trojans ground out a 11-4 run of their own to cut the Devils’ lead to just 1 at the end of the first quarter. 
“I told them [during a timeout] that if we scored more points, we’d probably win the game,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “We just talked about how they were getting second and third shots, so we had to box out, which we did a good job of, and I thought we played good defense, so I felt if we continued to play good defense, we’ll be fine.” 
The Trojans continued their momentum with a 13-4 run to take the lead and held a modest 5-point advantage by halftime. In the third quarter, the Trojans maintained the lead, but the Sun Devils’ junior guard Courtney Ekmark scored 12 points on four 3-pointers to keep Arizona State within range. However, the Trojans ultimately pushed their lead up as the fourth quarter wound down, and buried the Sun Devils behind a hot shooting night. 
“We just remained focus, we weren’t startled or any of that, we just came together as a team and made plays,” junior guard Aliyah Mazyck said. “Someone made a play and once we continued to each make a play, next thing you know, we’re up 10.” 
Graduate student guard Jordan Adams added her thoughts on the Trojans’ key 
“Defense,” Adams said. “We just gotta trust our defense, trust that we can get stops and then convert.”
Four Trojans scored in double digits led by Mazyck’s 24 and senior forward Kristen Simon’s 22 points. Senior guard Sadie Edwards and Adams combined for 19 and sophomore guard Minyon Moore recorded a double-double of 11 points and 10 assists. 
As a team, the Trojans shot a terrific 50.9 percent from the field including 9 for 18 from 3-point land; the team shot a scorching 61.5 percent (16/26) from the field in the second half.
“It was a great team win. I have the utmost respect for the coach over there,” Trakh said. “I think she’s one of the best coaches in the country and I have a tremendous amount of respect learning from watching her games. She’s awesome, her team’s really good and very well-coached. This is a big win of course, so we’re 6-7 and we got Arizona coming and it’s not going to be an easy game, but we might have got back on the bubble this weekend.”
On Sunday afternoon, the Trojans hosted the Arizona Wildcats and rout them in a 78-52 victory. The Trojans struck early and capped off their first quarter with a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from Adams to extend their lead to 7. 
The Trojans exploded for a 13-4 run to start the second quarter with Edwards draining three 3-pointers to start the run, which was capped off by an emphatic block, leading to a score and a timeout. The Trojans exerted their dominance in the quarter by building a 24-point lead by halftime and outscored the Wildcats 28-11 in the second quarter alone. 
In the second half, the Trojans continued to build their lead, going as far as a 64-30 advantage before eventually settling with a 31-point lead entering the final quarter. The Wildcats started the fourth quarter with an 11-0 run, but the Trojans would outscore them 14-5 the rest of the way en route to the win. 
“I thought we had a good weekend,” Trakh said. “We played very well against a nationally ranked team on Friday and today. We’re taking good shots, we’re playing good defense, and the kids are together, I’m excited because the kids are excited right now. We’re pretty darn close to winning 18, 19 games. So 17 wins, we got a tough, very tough road swing coming up and we finish up at home, but I’m really proud of the way these kids have stayed together and played their best basketball.”
The team as a whole shot an efficient 49.1 percent overall and a scorching 40.7 percent from 3-point land; they also outrebounded the Wildcats 41-26. Freshman forward Sam Thomas spearheaded Arizona’s efforts with 22 points of her own; however, the Wildcats shot poorly with a 33.9 percent overall percentage, turned the ball over (13) more than their assist numbers (10) and were outmuscled on the glass. 
“They understand the game well, they play hard, and they’re all very coachable: [Edwards], [Mazyck] and [Moore], have all been very very coachable, that’s the key,” Trakh said. “So that’s the part of the culture that I’m proud of, the kids have evolved to understand and play together and that it’s not all about points. [Tapley] gave us six offensive rebounds and we scored off a lot of the time. She didn’t score off of those offensive rebounds, but she gave us possession and that’s going to be the difference between a win or a loss.”  
The team hopes to continue its current momentum as they travel to Oregon to take on the Oregon schools next weekend in the final stretch of the season.

Julia Poe | Daily Trojan
The Olympics are beautiful, mainly because they serve as a form of entertainment and a tool for mass sports education all at once.
I’ve always loved the Games because of their ability to shine a spotlight on obscure sports. Who can honestly say that they keep up with alpine skiing or curling on a regular basis? And yet, every four years, we throw on our red, white and blue and cheer on little-known athletes in sports we can barely understand.
As my friends and I watched the biathlon on the couch of our sorority house on Sunday, we alternated between cheering loudly for the American competitors and laughing at ourselves for how intensely we were reacting to a sport most of us had known nothing about an hour before. We were all starting to undergo that typical Olympic transformation — on the first day, filled with confusion; on the last day, shouting at a figure skater for under-rotating by 10 degrees on a jump as if we’d been skating judges our entire lives. 
My favorite part of this whole process is the speed with which I find myself falling in love with athletes who I’d never heard of before. As one of the most popular sports of the Winter Olympics, figure skating is normally home to most of the idols on Team USA every four years. 
This time around, that couldn’t be any more true with Adam Rippon, the men’s figure skater who shook the skating world on Sunday.
As of about three days ago, Rippon had already become one of my favorite winter athletes, thanks mainly to his hilarious, off-the-cuff quotes. In one interview, when asked about the experience of being an openly gay athlete, he responded, “It’s exactly like being a straight athlete … but usually done with better eyebrows.” After his performance on Sunday, he looked straight into the camera and said he wanted “a Xanax and a drink” on live television.
This is the guy who almost performed to his own cover of a Rihanna song at the Olympics, the guy who took to Twitter to make sure that everyone knew his butt was real, not a product of padding. 
And he’s even more entertaining on the ice. On Sunday, Rippon gave a performance that combined much of the fluidity and artistic vision typically reserved for female skaters while still providing unbelievable power in his jumps and tricks. Every moment of the choreography — which was set to a Coldplay medley and met with gasps and astounding applause by the fans in the stands — was absolutely dazzling, and I was more than a little dumbfounded when it only earned him a bronze medal.
I find it both impossible and unpatriotic to dislike Rippon. But the reason he touched me so deeply on Sunday was because of what his medal and performance by an out gay man meant to me, as both a sports fan and a member of the LGBTQ community.
It’s not like I haven’t seen gay athletes compete before. I’ve been a women’s soccer fan for as long as I can remember, and watching Abby Wambach and Megan Rapinoe in their heydays in 2012, and their presence as out-and-proud gay women made a quiet but solid impact in my childhood as I became more comfortable with my own sexuality. 
But something about watching Rippon felt different. It took me a while to recognize why — that figure skating is an intimate sport, with all eyes focused on a single person, and that it’s rare to see a queer person in such a spotlight of celebration. In that spotlight, Rippon couldn’t help but shine.
There was such pride and grace in the way Rippon skated, in the way he joked with interviewers and cheered with his teammates. I knew, as I watched Rippon, what that moment meant to both him and to legions fans, both young and old, who were watching a star who was just like them being born.
Rippon didn’t win the top award of the Olympics, and he will probably soon be overshadowed in the media by Nathan Chen and other American stars. But it gives me both pride and hope to know that, for so many others like me, the greatest moment of the 2018 Olympics already happened.

Electronic dance music DJ Destructo took the stage at Avalon nightclub Friday night in Hollywood, attracting dance music aficionados from far and wide to the venue. The sold-out show had a line for rush tickets stretching far down Vine Street. 
DJ Destructo’s sold out show in Hollywood attracted a huge, enthusiastic crowd that brought the energy. Photos from Facebook.
Avalon’s main stage is in a large room with a high ceiling, reminiscent of a festival tent. The structure of the Let’s Be Friends tour made the night feel even more like an evening at Coachella. In the room leading to the main stage, there were multiple up-and-coming DJs playing, including Dusty Cloud and Wolf Among Weeds. On the main stage, four excellent electronic artists played one after another. The first pair to play was the DEUX twins, two young women with a fast-paced, heavy set who immediately riled the crowd. They combined mainstream tracks with their own aggressive drops. One track that got the crowd especially excited was a mashup of Soulja Boy’s “Crank Dat” and Ekali’s “I Can’t Stop.” 
Next on stage, dressed in a casual, half-buttoned Hawaiian shirt, was FISHER. The Australian former professional surfer didn’t play his signature tropical house sound; rather, bright red lights and black and red graphics punctuated his fast-paced, long mix style. He played considerably fewer crowd pleasers than DEUX, but the entire crowd was enthusiastic about the direction he took his set. 
The next artist to play was Dillon Nathaniel, who changed the pace of the previous two sets with a darker, moodier mix and violet lighting, but maintained the theme of house music’s classic “four on the floor” beats. He is signed by CONFESSION, the record label launched by DJ Tchami, and has produced two EPs — “Wanted” and “Nirvana” — under the label.
Clad entirely in white, Destructo began his set with a quick conversation with the audience, checking in with everyone and getting them excited for his performance. Having Destructo on stage revitalized a crowd that had already been dancing for hours. For the rest of the night and into the early morning, Destructo played popular songs: “Techno” and “4 Real,” as well as newer tracks off his EP “Renegade” and brand new singles “Shots to the Dome” and “Bassface.” The highlight of the night was the crowd’s response to the song “Party Up,” featuring YG. 
Destructo will continue the Let’s Be Friends tour in Houston, Philadelphia and his hometown Washington, D.C. before finally wrapping up in Portland, Ore.

Every Wednesday afternoon, yoga instructor Susan Biddlecomb leads a complimentary Kundalini yoga class in the Engemann Student Health Center. The class is part of the Happy Hour series sponsored by the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion, which offers a variety of free yoga classes throughout the semester. Kundalini yoga is one of the primary classes offered, providing students without any prior experience or training the opportunity to learn an uncommon yoga practice.
Every Wednesday, the Engemann Student Health Center hosts a Kundalini yoga session led by instructor Susan Biddlecommb. Olivia Ordin | Daily Trojan
Biddlecomb has been practicing Kundalini for almost a decade. As Director of Information Systems at Engemann, she originally started teaching the class to fellow staff members as a way to get people moving throughout their typically sedentary days at the office. 
“As a staff member, I knew that there were people that could use something to get moving during the day,” Biddlecomb said. “My thought was just to share [the practice] with other people and to help them as best as I could.” 
From there, the Kundalini classes blossomed, forming the bulwark of the Happy Hour series. Today, the practice is offered three times a week, attracting a variety of students and faculty members alike. 
As a practice, Kundalini is centered on breathing, meditation, exercise and endurance. Originally brought to the United States in 1969, the class involves a series of exercises that are connected to a greater theme, or “kriya,” that is articulated at the start of the session. Each session begins with a warm up and ends with meditation guided by the sounds of the gong. The exercises performed during the class are different each week. 
“The beginning and the end of each class are the same,” Biddlecomb said. “And within that, there are three components: warm-up, exercise sets and meditations.”
Throughout the class, participants are instructed on how to breathe, where to shift one’s focus and which part of the body to emphasize in each stretch or movement. Embedded in each hour-long session are chants and meditations dictated by the instructor, each of which are designed to stimulate energy flow. 
“Almost everything we do in this practice is related to moving energy in some way,” Biddlecomb said. “There are probably close to a thousand sets, and all the sets are exercises in a sort of order that move energy. Some of the exercises are just breaking up blockages in one area of the body.”
Biddlecomb also said that these meditations can be highly specific. Throughout the semester, she utilizes various themes depending on the social and political climates of both the University and the nation. 
“I have a pool of themes or topics that I pick from; there are some times when I will change up the class based on what’s happening in the world,” Biddlecomb said. “There are meditations for very specific situations that affect your nervous system in a major way, such as addiction, self-animosity, natural disasters [and] warfare.” 
Biddlecomb highlighted the primary benefits of consistent yoga practice for students at USC, underscoring its positive effects on work ethic and mental health. 
“This practice will affect your physical body as you move energy, but students have also told me over and over again that their practice has helped them to clear their minds and be better able to focus on their school work and activities,” she said. 
Furthermore, Biddlecomb added a personal note to conclude the class, expressing how Kundalini has transformed her life and career.
“Yoga was a plunge into something I had never done before,” she said. “But ultimately, I found my voice through it.”

Perhaps the thing I dislike most about my job is how much time I spend coming into the office on weekends. Though working at an opera house is probably the best job I could ever ask for, it’s hard to balance work with being a full-time graduate student when the time I’ve scheduled to devote to school work is interfered with, and subsequently overpowered by, impromptu trips to the office. 
The only upside, apart from hearing glorious music from below stage, is getting to play dress up. Since beginning my time at L.A. Opera, I’ve had to update my wardrobe significantly in order to keep up with the formal attire that is expected. I don’t have to wear a suit every day, just on weekends and show days —so 60 percent of the time. And as someone who wore t-shirts and Tretorns without fail almost every day, it’s been an adjustment. I’m so damn hot all the time. I mean that both in temperature and self-image. That probably makes me sound arrogant, but hey, I recognize beauty when I see it. And I’ve felt the need to share my self-love with the world. So the inflation is not only seen in my updated, ornate wardrobe, but also in my ego as well.
Without fail, when walking past mirrors, I find myself taking photos of myself to upload to Instagram. Before the photo shoot even begins, I have to confirm that every button and clasp is in place. Is my shirt tucked in correctly? Check. Are one or both sleeves poking out from under my suit jacket? Double check. Do I want to button up my shirt all the way to the collar for a tailored look, or am I feeling more relaxed today? Should I show a bit of chest? All of these aspects must be checked like a laundry list before I can even think about taking the first photo. Then I’ll need to check the lighting. Is there enough natural light to complement my olive-toned skin, or will I need to add a filter to avoid being washed out? Lastly, I’ll take a second to make sure no one is around, because what’s more embarrassing than being caught in the middle of a selfie?
After I’ve completed all my checks, I’m finally ready for my close-up. I’ll take somewhere between five to 50 photos of myself. And that’s not even the last stop. Factor in the time it takes grueling over which photo is best to upload, followed by editing, sharpening and repositioning, and you’d think I was Patrick Demarchelier. The process is excessive and self-indulgent. And I’ve only recently realized how much I hate myself because of it.

You, the reader, may think it’s sad how much time I spend over a single snapshot that will eventually end up lost in the sea of others’ selfies in a matter of hours. And I agree — it is sad. But I didn’t realize how bad the ordeal was until a few days ago, when I uploaded a picture of myself and had to put my phone on airplane mode because I couldn’t bear to look at how many likes the post got. Would the number of likes exceed the number of minutes since I posted it? That’s how I measure if a post is successful or not. Otherwise, I’ll probably end up deleting the snapshot. 
But in looking through my own Instagram feed, I realized that the way I portray myself is obnoxious because I’m creating a caricature of myself. Why do I need to upload a picture of every single book I’m reading? Because I’m so afraid of coming across as unintelligent that I feel the need to let the public know what I’m reading at all times. Additionally, why do I need to show the public the outfits I wear, or when I feel attractive?  Sometimes I’ll get a nice comment or a compliment, but these outfits — the ones I spend hours grueling over for the sake of a lit pic — will be forgotten by day’s end.
My relationship with social media is presented in a series of paradoxes. I am socially anxious in general and find that I care way too much of what people think of me. That’s one of the reasons I deactivated my Facebook last year, as well as to moderate the excessive amount of time I spend on social media. However, since leaving Facebook, my Instagram usage has skyrocketed. It didn’t happen right away — it took a few months for the transference to take place. And as someone whose self-esteem fluctuates from a dumpster on a USC gameday to Xerxes, High King of Persia, and nothing in between, I thought my newfound self-love was merely an increase in confidence. But really, it’s just made me annoying and bumptious. 
And it begins and ends with all the selfies. I find that my devotion to this so-called social media “persona” began as a way to compete with all the six-pack gays that flood my newsfeed on an hourly basis. Like them, I’m not satisfied with the affirmations from close friends and loved ones — I need them from strangers as well.
I really dislike this part of myself, which is why I’ve decided to take a break from posting. I was too caught up in my own narcissism to even notice how much time I spend thinking about my social media presence. But it’s hard not to think that way when our society places so much importance on influencers. Even all of my classes this semester have a unit on social media use. 
But since coming to terms with my Narcissian tendencies, the first step to recovery is to cease and desist. I’m not saying that I’ll never upload a selfie again, because we all know that’s a lie. And besides, there is no problem in priding oneself on physical appearance. But the whole world doesn’t need to know anymore, because my self-love should come from a place within myself, and not from the validation of others.
