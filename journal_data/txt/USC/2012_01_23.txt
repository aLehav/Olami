The Icon Plaza at USC, on the corner of Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard next to the Radisson Hotel, has pre-leased about 40 percent of its beds as construction continues on the apartment building.

All two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments have been pre-leased, and Icon Plaza Principal Billy Ruvelson said he expects all the beds to be assigned by April. The construction is scheduled to end in July, and tenants can move in during August .
The building is slated to have 256 beds in 56 units, and all units have individual bedrooms and in-unit washers and dryers. Prices range from $925 for a shared room in a five-bedroom apartment to $1,709 for a single in a two-bedroom apartment.
“We are conscious that not everybody can write a big check so we wanted to make [the apartments] available to a wide variety of students,” Ruvelson said.
The building will have a doorman, pool, fitness center, sundeck, a tanning bed and a courtyard for residents, as well as shops on the first floor.
“Students will have everything they need under one roof,” Ruvelson said.
Some students said they were glad to see another apartment building being built.
“More housing options are always a good thing,” said Eric Baughman, a freshman majoring in biochemistry.
Baughman said, while his future living plans are undecided, a private-owned apartment building full of amenities would be appealing.
Lena Cronin, a junior majoring in communication, said she hadn’t heard of the Icon Plaza.
“A new place that caters to students’ needs is beneficial,” Cronin said. “Housing is really competitive, so another place is nice.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety daily incident log between Friday, Jan. 20 and Monday, Jan. 22.
Crimes against a person
At 3:06 a.m. on Jan. 21, a student reported that she sustained injuries to her nose and forehead when another student forcibly removed her from a chair, in which she was sitting, and she struck her head on a bed at 2367 Portland St.. The student did not desire criminal prosecution of the matter and stated that she would seek medical treatment on her own
Miscellaneous incidents
At 11:31 p.m. on Jan. 22, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student with cuts and abrasions on his face.  The student was incoherent, and the officers were unable to ascertain how he was injured because of his impaired state.  An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #15 responded.  The RA Unit examined the student and transported him to California Hospital Medical Center for medical treatment.
At 12:10 a.m. on Jan. 22, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student who was reported to be unable to care for herself in West 27th Place Apartments.  LAFD RA Unit #15 was at the scene examining the student when the officers arrived, and she was subsequently transported to California Hospital Medical Center for medical treatment.
At 5:18 p.m. on Jan. 21, DPS officers responded to a traffic collision involving a juvenile who was struck by a university vehicle while riding his bicycle near 28th Street and Figueroa Street. The juvenile was not injured and there was no damage to his bicycle or the vehicle.  The student driving the vehicle and the juvenile’s guardian exchanged contact information, then the officers cleared the scene.
At 7:27 a.m. on Jan. 21, DPS officers responded to a report of a naked non-USC male asking for help at the Seeley Mudd Memorial Hall of Philosophy.  The officers determined the subject was intoxicated and unable to care for himself, so an LAFD RA unit was requested.  RA Unit #15 responded and examined the male, then transported him to California Hospital for medical treatment.

Dan Schnur dreamed of becoming a journalist, so he did what any aspiring reporter might do: enroll in a Minnesota college as a political science major and become the newspaper editor. He thought it would be the “path of least resistance” to achieving his goals.
Politico · Director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute Dan Schnur regularly moderates panels related to state and national politics. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
He soon learned, however, that simply studying politics was not enough. At 19 years old, he traveled from his Wisconsin home to Washington, D.C., to volunteer for Ronald Reagan’s 1984 presidential campaign over the summer.
“After a couple years of taking political science classes, I wanted to try it myself,” Schnur said. “I was young enough and dumb enough that rather than finding a local campaign, I decided to go for the gold.”
By the end of his summer in Washington, D.C., he had become a full-time staff member. His boss recommended that he return to college if he wanted to continue in politics, so he finished his degree at American University in Washington, D.C.
Schnur, however, didn’t think he would go on to teach politics. After a few more presidential campaigns, he became an adjunct professor at UC Berkeley and USC, and found himself loving the classroom.
In 2008, he became the director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and a full-time professor. He took a leave of absence in 2010 to work for California’s Political Practices Commission, but says he was glad to return to campus.
“I’ve quit politics for good three times now,” Schnur said. “I really do believe that now I’m done for good. That’s how much I love what I’m doing here at USC.”
Though his political expertise aids him in teaching political science courses, he aims to do much more than simply teach; he wants to inspire students to get involved in politics. The summer of his first campaign, he learned that politics is a place where young people can make a difference right away, a lesson he likes to share with his students.
Despite his work on several presidential campaigns and for other notable organizations, some of Schnur’s favorite memories come from his work with the Unruh Institute. He became director with one major goal: getting students involved in politics. His solution was “to bring the political world to campus,” and he created several programs to promote involvement.
The institute co-sponsors Students Talk Back lunches with the Daily Trojan to promote conversation among students and professionals. The institute also runs various events every semester, including panel discussions with professionals;  Schnur’s only rule is that students must be involved, “not just as audience members, but as participants.”
One of his most memorable moments at USC was after the 2008 presidential election, when the institute worked with Politico and the Daily Trojan to run a two-day conference with panels featuring advisers from the McCain and Obama campaigns and USC students. Each panel was co-moderated by editors of both publications, and saw students engaging in discussion with professionals, who were instructed to “treat them like adults.”
“Watching a bunch of 19-to-21-year-old USC students going toe-to-toe with professionals and holding their own was a revelatory experience,” Schnur said. “Students didn’t have the opportunity to just ask questions, but to be involved.”
Schnur has seen more than 100 students go on to work in the government, politics or political media, and said he never would have had this influence without teaching.
“Don’t get me wrong, I love politics,” Schnur said. “But after so many years of doing it, I realized the best contribution I could make was helping young people get involved on their own terms. When students ask me why I’m not on the campaign track anymore, I tell them, ‘It’s your turn.’”

The United Nations and the USC Shoah Foundation Institute launched iWitness, an interactive Internet application that allows students and educators to retrieve more than 1,000 video testimonies from the Holocaust, on Monday.
The application has been in progress since the Shoah Foundation was founded in 1994 by Steven Spielberg to preserve the testimonies of Holocaust survivors. The institute gained more than 50,000 archived testimonies, but developing a plausible method to share the information was its biggest challenge, said Kim Simon, managing director of USC Shoah Foundation institute.
“We were founded on the premise by Steven Spielberg after Schindler’s List to gather 52,000 testimonies of survivors and witnesses, and to videotape their life stories before the war, during the war and after the war,” Simon said. “The question of how to get access was a quest, but as the Internet became more prominent and important to education, we saw that it would be a responsible and appropriate educational setting.”
The development allows students to gain an extensive understanding of the Holocaust that would be limited by learning solely through a textbook.
“By searching and receiving, the student will have the ability to operate or engage in an intersection of the story and the video,” Simon said. “They are adding their own voice because they can record their narration that expresses what it means to them.”
Through the video testimonies, the viewer is given a different perspective on the history of the Holocaust.
“The video is an immediacy that allows them to not only see the faces but also hear the voices,” Simon said. “It’s from a personal point of view because they are connected with something that is very human, and that’s unique.”
Currently iWitness focuses on the Holocaust, but the institute is already planning to add testimonies from the Armenian, Rwandan and Cambodian genocides to the archive.
“We are interested in broadening and expanding the scope of testimony,” Simon said. “The archive will continue to expand.”
[…] “The video is an immediacy that allows them to not only see the faces but also hear the voices. It’s from a personal point of view because they are connected with something that is very human, and that’s unique,” Kim Simon, managing director of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute told USC’s campus publication, the Daily Trojan.

Gov. Jerry Brown’s latest budget proposal might cut $110 million from the Cal Grant system, which would affect financial aid for students enrolled in public and private California universities during the 2012-2013 school year.
As part of the $12.5 billion in reduced state spending, the cuts to the system would reduce the amount offered to students who choose to use Cal Grants at private institutions and would raise the minimum requirements for students to qualify for a Cal Grant.
The Cal Grant system consists of Cal Grant A and Cal Grant B, which are offered to students based on merit and demonstrated financial need. The grants do not have to be paid back.
Cal Grant A provides for tuition and fees in the California State University and University of California systems, as well as tuition support at private, nonprofit schools such as USC. Up to $12,192 is offered to each eligible students in the UC system, up to $5,472 to students in the CSU system, and up to $9,708  to students at private schools.
Brown is proposing cutting the award money offered to students at private schools by 44 percent to the CSU level in addition to raising the minimum GPA requirement for Cal Grant A from 3.0 to 3.25.
The USC Financial Aid Office could help make those cuts manageable for students attending USC, despite worries that such cuts would make it more difficult for low-income students to cover the cost of attending a private school, said Thomas McWhorter, the dean of financial aid.
“In a place like USC, where we still meet the full determined need of the students, I wouldn’t anticipate [a drop in the number of low-income students], but any time you have a reduction in the amount of gift aid that’s given I can understand that there may be some changes in attendance,” McWhorter said.
McWhorter, however, said that with a reduction in either state or federal money offered to students as part of their financial aid package, the additional money would have to come from either increased university resources or more loans included in the financial aid package.
“USC has a commitment to meet the full need of our students,” McWhorter said. “When a major source of aid changes like this, it means the money has to come from somewhere else.”
The possibility of Cal Grant cuts would be especially worrisome for students hoping to attend a private university as a freshman in fall 2012, said Veronica Villalobos, the executive director of state government relations for USC in Sacramento.
Because the finalized state budget isn’t constitutionally due until June 15 and incoming freshmen must confirm their college decision by early May, students could have to make their decision before knowing how much aid they will receive from the state.
“The impact of a 44 percent cut [for Cal Grants at private schools] would be particularly dramatic,” Villalobos said. “Sometimes students choose not to go to a private university because it looks like their grant is going to be cut significantly. There’s a lot of uncertainty.”
Zarkhi Palmer, a freshman majoring in business administration, is a recipient of a Cal Grant who said that if the state had offered him less money while he was making his decision and his financial aid package was unable to offset the difference, he would have had to think twice about attending a private university.
“If the school financial aid didn’t cover [tuition], I probably would not have come [to USC],” Palmer said. “I would have gone to a cheaper school.”
Approximately 1,900 undergraduate students, or just over 10 percent of the undergraduate population, are currently recipients of a Cal Grant as part of their financial aid package, alongside other aid such as loans, scholarships and the Federal Work-Study program.
According to Villalobos, these students would have their grants cut for 2012-2013 as well, and a large enough cut might even have some students deciding to transfer.
To avoid this situation, Villalobos said USC has been partnering with other California private schools to push for changes to the budget proposal that would not hit their students as hard.
Villalobos said former Gov. Schwarzenegger proposed a similar cut in 2004, but schools and students were able to fight back and have the cut reduced to 14 percent.
“Because the budget is so bad and there’s not much room to make cuts, it’s really going to be a big fight this year that students have to initiate to protect their financial aid,” Villalobos said.

In the afterglow of the 2011 football season, which ended with a 10-2 overall record, students and Trojan fans are already craving what lies ahead for 2012.
Where is the love? · The USC women’s basketball team, faced with one of the toughest schedules in the nation, is one of the many athletic teams not getting as much attendance or support as the football program. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
 
Sure, that is not surprising, considering juniors Matt Barkley and T.J. McDonald decided to return for their senior seasons; not to mention, the 2012 roster is filled with talented returning and incoming players.
Aside from the resurgence of the USC football program, 2011 also marked the fourth-consecutive championship for the men’s water polo team.
The men’s tennis team clinched its third consecutive championship in 2011. The women’s volleyball team advanced to the Final Four before falling short of the national championship game in December.
Without a doubt, USC is back to its dominance in college athletics.  One piece, however, is still missing from the puzzle: attendance.
Fans flocked back to the Coliseum in 2011 once the Trojans accumulated a few wins. Some blame this on the typical L.A. fan that suddenly appears once a team, regardless of whom, begins to succeed.
Two weeks ago, the USC men’s basketball team hosted crosstown rival UCLA at the Galen Center. Almost every seat was filled despite the Trojans being winless in Pac-12 conference play.
Yes, it was a rivalry game. But why are only 1,000 (or fewer) attending a women’s basketball game?
Why aren’t Trojan fans and, more importantly, USC students attending the sporting events on campus aside from football and men’s basketball?
The Women of Troy, led by coach Michael Cooper, are on the verge of being one of the top basketball programs in the country.
Despite losing senior guard Jacki Gemelos because of an Anterior Cruciate Ligament injury, the Women of Troy boast a 5-2 record in the Pac-12 conference, only losing to Stanford and Oregon State.
Overall, the Women of Troy have racked up a 10-7 record thus far. USC scheduled one of the toughest road schedules in which they traveled to play top programs such as Georgia, Texas A&M and Notre Dame.
With this caliber of program in USC’s own backyard, why aren’t more students venturing to the Galen Center on Thursday and Saturday nights?
The USC athletic department has instituted reward programs in which students receive points for attending USC athletic events. Ideally, this is to attract students to watch women’s basketball and baseball, in addition to men’s and women’s volleyball. Students who attend a certain number of events receive a reward for supporting Trojan athletics.
The reward program is a great way to get students excited about USC athletics. They shoud, however, be itching to attend a baseball or basketball game and support fellow Trojans.
Like most people, I am flabbergasted by the lack of support and fandom for USC teams other than football. Though, in regard to football, after one loss to ASU and narrow wins in the beginning of the season, everyone was calling for USC coach Lane Kiffin to be fired. Ridiculous.
USC has some of the best athletic programs in the country and all of them deserve the pomp and circumstance the more well-known programs are privy to. Instead of staying in on a Thursday night, I encourage all USC students to go watch the Women of Troy or catch a men’s volleyball game on a Friday night.
USC students and fans: Let’s break the stigma of the typical L.A. fan and support all the athletic programs at USC, regardless of renown.
 
Andie Hagemann is a senior majoring in communication. Her column “Armchair Quarterback” runs Tuesdays. 
I did not go to any game while I was at SC, over 10 years ago.  And I have regretted that I didn’t do it since I left.  So, for all of you SC fans and alumnus out there —  Go support everyone of your team whenever you can!!  Win or lose… Forever SC!  Fight On!!
Football is the meat & potatoes sport of SC. Football ticket sales and related revenue carry the weight of the other sports by a lot. 
SC’s football program is so popular, that it has fans (throughout S Cal) who aren’t even alumni nor associated with SC in any way. That says a lot. There is a larger-than-life legacy about Trojan football….Hell, even if they brought an NFL team to Los Angeles, it still wouldn’t take away from SC football’s limelight.
First off, great that this got picked up by an ESPN blog.  Secondly, the students need to be supporting these other sports.  When I was in school at USC, I would attend volleyball, baseball, soccer, most men’s basketball, a few women’s basketball, and any other sports that were going on when I had free time.  I don’t understand why students wouldn’t want to join in the fun of just showing Trojan spirit. I don’t think anyone has a duty to go sit through things they don’t like but I am surprised more people don’t find going to these game fun.
You deserve a cookie!
I want to know how many games(any sport) has the writer attended and not because you are a journalist?
I can’t speak for the women’s sports, but for Men’s basketball, one way to increase attendance would be for the team to actually win.  And that would mean to have a coach who actually can coach.  Not a re-tread like Kevin O’Neill who’s been a failure everywhere he’s been.
But, oneill has some really cool glasses if you’re a science nerd from the 50’s. I love those glasses! They remind of the dumb films I used to watch in science class.
yes, i am a trojans fan.  i attend the one football game a year(usually against ucla or norte dame).  the reason that i attend only one game is called money.  i would love to attend other sporting events, but with life bills(mortgage, utilities, etc), i have only so much.  when the personal economics gets better, i will be looking into attending other sporting events besides your wonderful football games.  WE ARE SC!!!  FIGHT ON!!!
All the other games are FREE BECAUSE of the money football brings in. Come up with a better excuse than “woe is me.”
This is only true for students, not for alumns or fans who aren’t attending the school.
I am an alum. For those who haven’t experienced it, going to baseball, men’s and women’s tennis, and other outdoor sports is awesome in the springtime.  Check it out if you haven’t!  Go Trojans!
The lack of support for the minor sports is atrocious especially on the woman side. Have to disagree that woman basketball is on the verge of being a top program. That has been the rallying cry for too long by the athletic dept.
First must legitimately finish in the top twenty in the polls for one year to start and then do it again once in the following two years to be considered a top anything. You can’t lose to an Arkansas St. on the road and Oregon St. at home if you are going to make the ncaa tournament or break into the top 25 rankings. A headliner like Brittney Griner of Baylor is needed to make the alums and fans find something enticing to come out to watch and hopefully get
hooked on the game.

while you’re dreaming, why not have Lisa Leslie make some ball players for you. She is not part man like griner and was a great baller.

With the Feb. 1 national signing day fast approaching, impatient USC football enthusiasts are scouring all forms of social media to see which recruits are committing to college athletic programs. Though recruiting outlets might fawn over these 17 and 18-year-old athletes and assure them future stardom, USC coach Lane Kiffin’s upcoming task is, on many levels, unenviable.
Sanctioned · As a result of NCAA sanctions imposed on the team, the USC football coaching staff will have to shed some current players. The Trojans are currently allowed to carry 75 players on its roster. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
He and his staff must pore over hours of high school tape, leaf through stacks of scouting reports and recall gut impressions from house visits, all to assemble a recruiting class of 15 student-athletes — 10 fewer scholarships than other BCS teams are allowed to dole out for the 2012 class. And the total scholarship count for USC cannot exceed 75 players in each of the next three seasons.
The implications of these scholarship reductions levied by the NCAA in summer 2010 are two-fold: Kiffin and his staff cannot afford to misevaluate their recruits, and a handful of current underachieving  scholarship holders will most likely be encouraged to transfer or be stripped of their scholarships.
The reality of fewer scholarships is that each scholarship player must fulfill an important role.
And though each football scholarship is awarded on a yearly basis, programs typically don’t cut a player purely for football performance reasons. Student-athletes usually lose scholarships for a combination of academic and disciplinary issues.
According to ESPN.com, USC has, at the moment, at least 59 scholarship players on its roster from last season that intend to play  next year. The program has signed six players as mid-year enrollees who will count toward the 2011 class, bringing its scholarship total to 65. If all those student-athletes play for USC next year, Kiffin and his staff can only sign 10 players for the 2012 class.
The NCAA’s penalty might prevent these marginal USC players out of a degree because they can no longer afford to attend the university.
Kiffin and his staff will need to conduct sit-down conversations with several scholarship players who are buried on the depth chart.
For many players, transferring to another school to receive more playing time and exposure is not the worst outcome, although players transferring between BCS schools must sit out a year before regaining eligibility.
Instead of looking to transfer, some USC scout-team players are content to graduate from a prestigious university with a valuable degree they might not have otherwise had the opportunity to earn.

The only thing that could stop USC men’s tennis in its doubleheader last weekend was the weather.
After the rain postponed No. 1 USC’s matchups against Loyola Marymount and UC Santa Barbara on Saturday, the Trojans dispatched both teams in 7-0 sweeps a day later at Marks Stadium to begin the spring dual-match season undefeated at 2-0.
Sweep · Sophomore Ray Sarmiento and the No. 1 USC men’s tennis team began their spring dual-match season by sweeping both Loyola Marymount and UC Santa Barbara last weekend at home. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
Three pairs of Trojans swept the doubles field against UCSB, including another 8-0 shutout by freshman Yannick Hanfmann, this time joining Jordi Vives to oust the Gaucho’s Ben Recknagel and Ziad Sultan.
“We had five guys play matches today that have never played [collegiately]. Yannick was an extreme — he didn’t lose a game in doubles,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “That’s pretty hard to be perfect.”
Senior Daniel Nguyen earned the team’s first single point against UCSB with a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Mathieu Forget. He began both sets by breaking Forget, who fell victim to several shutout games in the match.
Nguyen’s win was promptly followed by another 6-0, 6-1 victory by USC freshman Jonny Wang over Alexander Gryaznov. Sophomore Emilio Gomez then guaranteed USC’s win by beating Greg Scott 6-1, 6-2 for the Trojan’s third singles point.
Freshman Eric Johnson, freshman Roberto Quiroz and sophomore Ray Sarmiento emerged victorious in their matches to finalize USC’s sweep over UCSB.
USC senior Steve Johnson, the reigning 2011 NCAA Singles Champion, was slated to play on Saturday and to leave for the 2012 Honolulu Challenger tournament a day later, but the rain delay prevented him from joining the Trojans in their wins.
Despite Johnson’s absence, Smith lauded the team’s efforts for its strong performance.
“We weren’t taking points off, we weren’t taking shots off and we went after it,” Smith said. “We did some really good things today, and it’s a great sign for our team.”
The first doubles victory of USC’s season came at the hands of No. 33 Hanfmann and Vives, who quickly swept their opponents 8-0. Shortly after, No. 18 Nguyen and No. 12 Sarmiento sealed the doubles point for USC with an 8-3 victory.
In court one of singles play, Gomez maintained his strong play from doubles, smashing a rocket serve that LMU’s Alex Wilton could not control to win USC’s first set of the season 6-1. He began the second set by breaking Wilton to control the tempo early, leading to his 6-1, 6-1 victory.
“I just wanted to keep the energy up from doubles,” Gomez said. “I was very relaxed, which was a big key for my game.”
Next, Hanfmann shut out Nicholas Bjerke in the final game of the second set to earn a 6-3, 6-3 victory. USC freshman Johnson then bested Felix Van Kann 6-2, 6-4 to push the team score to 4-0, clinching USC’s win over Loyola Marymount.
Sophomore Corey Smith, Quiroz and Vives also defeated their opponents to round out the 7-0 USC win.
Gomez, ranked No. 48 in Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings, led the charge with two singles and two doubles wins in both matches.
“[Gomez] is becoming a real go-to guy for our team — not just in matches, but in practice,” Smith said. He’s got the heart and soul of our team with his work ethic.”
The Trojans now have a week of rest before hosting UNLV, UNC Wilmington and South Florida in the ITA Kick-Off Weekend on Saturday and Sunday at Marks Stadium.

Theophilus London performed Sunday at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, and the Brooklyn-based singer, known for his hit “I Stand Alone,” led his fans on a two-hour tour through his material, all while displaying constant energy and bravado.

The crowd seemed restless as the minutes crawled onward. The opening act, K. Flay, a talented rapper, producer and drummer, showcased her infectious hooks and impressive  lyrical flow for a 45-minute set that impressed the crowd. After the young artist finished, the long delay ensued.
When the show finally began, it wasn’t London who came to the stage first. Instead, it was his hype-man who appeared, running across the stage and grabbing the microphone from the introducer in an attempt to excite the crowd before the star of the show came on.
When the main act did arrive, London exhibited what can only be described as utter confidence, his every move dripping with self-assuredness.
Between standing on the edge of the stage and dancing energetically throughout the performance, London also pulled out some quirky, hilarious moves, including what can only be called a 21st-century guitarist Chuck Berry duckwalk, jumping backwards across the stage on one leg, making the crowd roar with approval simultaneously.
As London continued through his set, the arrangement of his band changed. When he first began in his performance, it was London and his hype-man, a current interpretation of something reminiscent of P. Diddy’s contributions to Biggie Smalls’ tracks. In this case, London’s hype-man frantically interjected with emphasis on select words from London’s lyrics, amping up the energy in the venue.
Afterward, a guitarist and bassist joined London and his hype-man on stage and played a couple songs, injecting a more rock feel to the concert in the process. Even more surprising, London invited a girl — chosen by his hype-man of course — onto the stage and serenaded her with a completely new track as she danced around him, obviously happy to be on the stage.
She didn’t seem to want to leave after the song was over, but the fast pace of the show meant she was quickly helped off.
London’s concert continued on with even more surprises in store for the audience. After the girl was sent off the stage, the guitarist and bassist put down their instruments. Two more friends joined them and the hype-man on the stage.
This left London singing and rapping, five friends dancing and interacting with the crowd, a venerable party occurring around them. Unfortunately, this riotous behavior proved distracting, as some of the things London’s crew was doing were not really connected to what London himself was doing. This lack of synchronicity included two stage dives — one successful and one mishap involving a crewmember being awkwardly dropped to the ground.
At one point, London left the stage, merely leaving his five friends dancing to the beat of the song as the crowd wondered what was going on. London remained out of view for a couple minutes, with some of his crewmembers even commenting into the microphone as the beat continued.
Then, like magic, London reemerged with a new hat and jacket, as energetic as ever.
Finally, after this extended run-through his new material, London got to his biggest hit, “I Stand Alone.” A number about individuality and finding one’s way, the song shows off a heavy OutKast-like influence, dynamic in its instrumentation and undoubtedly catchy.
It was enthralling to see London suddenly stop his constant motion around the stage when he reached the chorus. Standing as still as possible, grasping his until-then-unused microphone stand and singing and rapping for his crowd, London was in command of the stage.
The wait was worth it — the impatient crowd welcomed London in earnest when he finally arrived on stage and was treated to exactly what it expected from a frenetic, diverse artist like London, who forwent any real organization in his show in exchange for the indefatigable energy he brought to the El Rey audience.

O.A.R., which stands for Of A Revolution, has made itself known to most with singles “Love and Memories,” “Hey Girl” and “Shattered.”
The band’s latest single, “Heaven,” has reintroduced the group to the forefront of musical relevance since its previous record, All Sides, which was released in 2008. In support of its seventh studio album, King, O.A.R. will be touring the West Coast throughout January and February.

The band perfectly exemplifies the tale of the rising artist, beginning with intimate shows in its parents’ basements to performing its seventh release for sold-out stadiums. - Photo courtesy of Danny Clinch
For O.A.R., King marks an artistic milestone in a journey that began in high school. Before selling out stadiums and going platinum, the band members filled their parents’ basements with an energy that would eventually transform into hit singles and memorable tunes. After high school, O.A.R. continued to perform together at Ohio State University, where the band’s four original members (lead singer Marc Roberge, drummer Chris Culos, bassist Benj Gershman and guitarist Richard On) attended school.
Once in college, O.A.R. added fifth member Jerry DePizzo to fill out its sound. DePizzo plays saxophone and contributes as a multi-instrumentalist.
“I met Marc [Roberge] at freshman orientation down at Ohio State,” DePizzo said. “We were buddies, and [my involvement with the band] first was helping move equipment, which turned into jamming at sound check, which turned into a show, which turned into all the shows and records.”
O.A.R. built a loyal fan base while attending Ohio State University, and it was with the support of its fans that the band was able to bring its sound to the next level of success.
“I take a lot of pride in the fact that there has always been a real grassroots, groundswell effort to grow this band,” DePizzo said. “It really came from the audience pushing us forward and moving us on to the next levels of our careers.”
In return for all the support provided by its fans, O.A.R. never showed up empty-handed to a concert.
“There was always a unique spark to O.A.R. and the[ir] concerts. O.A.R. never played to an empty house. People were always there; people were always engaged in what we were doing,” DePizzo said. “It’s exciting to look at the different shows along the West Coast and see a lot of sold out rooms.”
With the traction of a positive response in college, O.A.R. went on to release four albums. The band made its presence known to mainstream listeners when it released its fifth studio album, Stories of a Stranger, in 2005.
Today, with the successful release of its seventh album, King, O.A.R. looks to take its talents to major cities along the West Coast, including shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle.
The writing process of King took the band to each member’s hometown. This opportunity gave the band a chance to see where each member’s inspirations were rooted before recording.
“We went to each individual’s respective hometown and spent a week there hanging out, writing tunes, playing together,” DePizzo said. “From that we were so much more rehearsed and polished going into the studio.”
O.A.R. has long sung tales of misdirection, as personified by its fictional character “The Wanderer” from its first album.
For a band that constantly plays with the idea of the road less traveled, King suggests that the band has just begun to understand its place in this world.
“I think [King] is a coming into your own story,” DePizzo said. “It’s about gaining the confidence, and the direction and the wherewithal within oneself to go out and lead people.”
O.A.R.’s immersion in the music world perfectly demonstrates the necessity of self-confidence. Moreover, the band showcases the need for self-discovery.
“Discover who you are. Go down that path, go on that journey, and this record sums that up. That character ‘The Wanderer’ is coming back, weathered, seasoned and ready to be the person he was destined to be,” DePizzo said. “That’s what we’re all going through in our own lives right now. It’s taking control of your own destiny and being your own man or woman.”
 
O.A.R. will perform in Los Angeles at the House of Blues in West Hollywood on Jan. 27.
SO PSYCHED FOR THIS CONCERT!!!

Talk of the shrinking middle class has gotten plenty of lip service in the U.S. political arena for several years. Some say the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, and there seem to be fewer opportunities for those who would be content finding a comfortable life in the middle class.
TV is undergoing a similarly polarizing trend. Some networks are engaged in an apparent race to the bottom, eager to schedule more hours of lowest-common-denominator programming than their competitors.  Others intend on airing only sophisticated original content with an air of intellectualism, most of which could be justifiably accused of being inaccessibly elitist.
Networks clearly had both extremes of the taste spectrum in mind when scheduling lineups. But if you’re looking for something more middle-of-the-road, don’t hold your breath — television’s disappearing middlebrow makes finding shows to suit your tastes unlikely.
A quick look at how a handful of recently premiered shows are holding up in their debut seasons suggests that major broadcast networks are seriously underestimating their audience’s maturity level.
ABC’s Work It received the critical equivalent of tarring and feathering many weeks before its on-air premiere and perhaps best represents viewers’ desires not to be patronized. Before the network made the prudent decision to cut losses to finances and reputation after only two episodes, the show depicted the cross-dressing exploits of two men who thought they’d have better luck finding jobs in the guise of females — because everybody knows this is a woman’s world (81 cents to every dollar a man makes? Yes, please!).
Beyond the expected outcry from the LGBT community, which protested the show’s exploitation of demeaning stereotypes for jokes — though not for successful laughs, mind you — the broader audience appeared to take offense as well. Seeing ABC’s decision to air Work It as an insult to the audience’s intelligence doesn’t seem to be an unreasonable interpretation. Surely ABC didn’t think it could air a slap in the face of Work It’s caliber and not expect to bruise a few egos in the process.
Audiences are now voting with their viewership, and their message is clear: Throw the bums out.
CBS’ Rob starring Rob Schneider, on the other hand, appears to be holding onto a significant number of eyes. Despite seeing a 15 percent fall-off in viewership from its debut, the show, a 22-minute-long Mexican joke predicated on the hilarity of an interracial marriage, has posted two strong ratings performances in a row.
But Rob has clearly found its perfect home on CBS. Factoring in the racial caricatures that dominate the network’s shows, such as 2 Broke Girls, the network seems to be actively cultivating a reputation as the finest pickers of low-hanging fruit.
Programming skewing toward the other end of the spectrum has problems of its own, but loud opposition is not among them. As a matter of fact, highbrow shows have quite the opposite problem: Too few people are watching to care one way or another about their destinies.
For all their cultural clout, critically acclaimed shows are generally seen by only a fraction of the audience of shows like American Idol. For instance, the all-time most watched episode of Mad Men still drew less than 3 million viewers — ratings that would get the show canceled on a broadcast network.
The story is the same for many other critical favorites, such as Breaking Bad, Boardwalk Empire, Downtown Abbey, and even a few comedies, such as Shameless and Flight of the Conchords.
Obviously, all these shows have one thing in common that keeps them from ever posting Big Bang Theory or American Idol numbers: With the exception of PBS’ Downtown Abbey, they’re all cable or premium-cable shows.
Even if these shows weren’t forced to contend with the fragmented audience that naturally accompanies a medium like cable, they would have a hard time finding a footing in the broadcast format. Many juggle complex storylines and are too serialized for broadcast networks’ undependable viewing audiences.
Still, there are certainly elements of highbrow shows that could contribute to a fantastic middlebrow program.
Compelling seasonal arcs are absolutely crucial in every one of television’s most-respected shows, as is a strong sense of place — no disrespect to ABC’s terrifically funny, Chicago-set Happy Endings, but it could take place anywhere, whereas Showtime’s Shameless makes no mistake about its location in the Windy City.
It also never hurts to throw in flaws and moral ambiguity — sometimes it seems as though a mere extra in Mad Men has greater emotional complexity than Cory Monteith’s Finn Hudson on Glee.
By combining the marketable appeal that defines broadcast fare with the maturity, storylines and dedicated sense of setting that characterize cable’s best, the pilots for NBC’s Smash and Fox’s Alcatraz show tremendous promise for the resurgence of the middlebrow.
And shows like FX’s Justified, which recently kicked off its third season, indicate there’s still some life in the procedural format, if only executives are brave enough to shake things up a bit.
So middlebrow audiences, take heart: There are reasons to hope. The best of both worlds is yours for the taking if you know where to look and what to watch.

At first, Lynne Ramsay’s We Need to Talk About Kevin delicately balances on the surface of unsettling, introspective melodrama.
Eerie drama · Tilda Swinton (left) and John C. Reilly (right) deliver phenomenal performances as parents with a deeply disturbed, distant son who is on the path to becoming a sociopathic murderer. - Photo courtesy of Oscilloscope Pictures
 
As the film progresses, however, it transforms, in truly breathtaking fashion, into a haunting, morbidly fascinating, blood-drenched tapestry of suburban nightmares, dancing and twisting marvelously around the fundamental human dilemma of birthing and raising a child to become a functional member of society.
Based on the novel by Lionel Shriver, the film centers around Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton), the mother of Kevin (Ezra Miller), a boy who exudes misery, indifference toward others and antagonism from infancy through his early teens toward his mother. From that point on, Kevin begins developing sociopathic tendencies and sets himself on a path to wreak devastating tragedy on his small town.
Ramsay arouses twinges of anxiety and uncertainty with a balanced, nuanced progression of plot, using a nonlinear structure to slowly bring every one of the audience’s fears to fruition.
Characters weave in and out of the periphery of the central narrative, including Eva’s husband, Franklin (John C. Reilly), a constant source of positive energy but also a wellspring of delusion concerning his son, as well as several victims or relatives of victims of the havoc that Kevin will ultimately create. The major weight of the film, however, rests on the relationship between Eva and Kevin, told almost entirely from Eva’s point of view.
Kevin is typically depicted as psychotic, inhuman, even a kind of demon child that would not be out of place in a film like The Omen. There are moments, however, where the film forcefully reminds the audience he is just a boy, craving his mother’s attention and love.
It is perhaps these elements that make the film so tantalizingly disturbing — the audience is not given the outlet of dismissing the story as horror fiction because it captures authentic life.
The integral question of the film revolves around the responsibility of a parent for a child’s actions. Though Eva’s point of view dominates the film, this doesn’t hide the fact that she blames herself for Kevin’s problems, and her perspective often reveals her to be a truly irresponsible, even reprehensible mother. She seems to lack basic maternal instincts, unable to cope with Kevin’s incessant crying as a baby.
At one point, she even throws him and inadvertently breaks his arm when he is a young boy, frustrated by his determined refusal to become toilet-trained.
Nonetheless, the audience is compelled to sympathize with Eva. She seems aware of her own failings as a parent and makes a conscious effort to be a better mother, yet her son’s appalling behavior persists.
Kevin often seems to act the way he does simply out of a hatred of — or perhaps just the desire for attention from — his mother. He consistently professes his love to his father and simultaneously tries to elicit misery from his mother, a bizarre reversal of the conventional Freudian son-mother-father triangle, in which the son views the father as the main competitor for the mother’s affection.
The film poses incredibly difficult questions for its viewers. It could plausibly be the most disturbing film any parent will ever watch. It opens doorways into the greatest, most terrible nightmares of rearing a child who leaves a negative impact on the world and the possibility that the impact could be the parents’ own fault.
These questions largely go unanswered by the film, which takes a decidedly qualifying stance on the issue of responsibility. We Need to Talk About Kevin instead invokes the even more frightening possibility of prevailing uncertainty and doubt.
To realize this horrifying vision, Ramsay employs stellar use of editing and effects.
Of particular note is the sound design, a soul-shaking menagerie of auditory assaults that bastardize the mundane sounds of suburbia such as the hiss of a spinning sprinkler, the hum of a fax machine and the dull grind of a garbage disposal, transforming them into alarm bells of the macabre psyche of Kevin.
Such a dynamic mix of aural elements recalls Roman Polanski’s forays into female psychological terror such as Repulsion and Rosemary’s Baby, dedicating sound to the task of unsettling the audience in a manner consistent with the gut-wrenching narrative.
Also not to be overlooked is the production of the film — in particular the dazzling use of the color red to mark themes of guilt, anguish and Eva’s struggle with the implications of Kevin’s tragic actions.
Ultimately, the precisely calibrated, thoroughly unnerving performances of Swinton and Miller as Eva and Kevin, respectively, anchor the film, preventing the film’s somewhat experimental style from ever alienating the audience.
Instead, We Need to Talk About Kevin grips viewers tightly throughout, never letting them look away from the grotesquely fascinating terrors of raising a child.

Meet Tommy Trojan, your average student. He occasionally watches The Daily Show with Jon Stewart but he otherwise has little knowledge of the current political scene. Keeping up with current events isn’t too big of a concern anyway — it’ll do to know the gist.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
This lack of political vitality characterizes the majority of college students across the nation. According to TechnicianOnline.com, 18- to 24-year-olds consistently have the  lowest voter turnout.
USC, unfortunately, is not much better off. Though USC has many politically oriented student groups, day-to-day political discussions are hard to find.
As students of voting age, we should be talking more about political affairs, even outside the presidential election season.
The media tends to blame our generation’s low voter turnout on political apathy. But is that really the only factor?
We are inundated with too many news outlets, and each one expects viewers to know the basics of politics.
In college, students should no longer rely on their parents in order to stay informed. The responsibility falls directly on the students, most of which are too busy studying for midterms.
Most college students are still trying to get their lives together. Modern day politics are not simple enough to pick up on the fly. News stations need to realize that they should be targeting multiple audiences.
Busy students — and even working adults — need news stations or websites that can summarize political highlights every week and that can deliver them in an engaging and informative manner.
Think ESPN’s top five plays of the week, but more in-depth.
Michelle Kang, a freshman majoring in global health, said she was not up-to-date with politics,
“I only usually follow the presidential elections or anything that relates to health policies.,” Kang said. Other than that, politics sort of just makes me angry.”
Anger: another reason why students don’t pay attention to politics. Anger at the politicians stubbornly holding on to partisanship instead of making decisions that will benefit the whole, regardless of what party they belong to. Didn’t politicians take anything away from George Washington’s farewell address, which warned against political factions? Oh, Congress.
But anger comes from what the media portrays, and it’s no secret that every news station is at least a little biased. The problem is no one has time to read newspapers front to back; students choose sections based on personal interests.  Once again, students find themselves in a situation where it might be the most convenient to stay static — but we can’t keep doing that.
No one wants to feel left out of current events, especially if it is an issue that calls for national debate. The problem with staying in our current, uninformed state is that we’re in danger of getting stuck, a dilemma that will carry over to our middle ages when our political knowledge might matter even more.
Politics might not always be fascinating, but we, as American citizens, give our government the power to rule. As such, we have a moral obligation to understand why we continue to do what we do, lest we defer to anarchy for lack of knowledge.
So, ask around, watch the news, read articles online, anything that will get you talking about politics and that will encourage your friends to do the same.
In a few years, we won’t be at USC. That’s when political knowledge will really count.

You know the scene: It’s game day, and you’re at a tailgate on campus.  Between the tailgates and the crowds, people wander around looking for fresh recyclables. You finish off a beer and hand it with a nod to a person with a large black trash bag.
For some USC students, this is the most exposure they get to poverty in the community.
The community surrounding USC is in the lower end of the income bracket, but that doesn’t mean students don’t try to help. Every once in a while, individuals and organizations combine partying with a noble cause: charity.  It’s a fun and easy way to have a good time and to feel like you’re doing something positive for the community.
But who is really benefitting from these parties? Their effectiveness is questionable.
The hypocrisy behind a party for charity is not what happens at the events, but what happens on other weekends. Every weekend, thousands of USC students consume thousands of dollars of alcohol. USC has around 17,000 undergraduates. If only a quarter of USC students drink every weekend and spend $5 on alcohol each weekend, that’s more than $20,000 spent on alcohol.
A large charity party would have a difficult time raising anywhere close to that amount.
Timo Yates, a junior majoring in fine arts, and his roommates throw several parties a semester. The parties regularly bring in more than 150 people, but not everyone pays to drink. Despite buying off-brand soda and the cheapest liquor and beer available, the initial cost rises above $300. Yates’ house usually pulls in about $450. But after factoring in the cost of paper towels, cups, ice and buckets, a decent revenue suddenly becomes a slim profit.
“Even after charging everyone who drinks for entry, we didn’t even break even on our first party,” Yates said.
Most of these kind of charity benefits charge $5 for unlimited alcohol. On one hand, the hosts could raise the entry fee to $10. On the other hand, they could cut alcohol out of the question — but could a charity party survive as a dry party? Alcohol might indeed be the only reason some people show up to parties.
But even though more people means more fundraising, the profit isn’t always worth it.
One aspect of college life becomes painfully obvious when examining these parties: We rely on alcohol. For many people, getting drunk is what the weekend is for.
But it’s time to try a new type of fundraiser. Enforce a dry weekend on The Row and donate all the money that would have been spent on alcohol to a worthy cause. This kind of program could easily be spearheaded by fraternities and sororities, both of which control a significant portion of social life on campus. Entertainment value could bring people to these parties, and many talented USC artists are willing to perform at parties for free.
Many students like to say we’re helping the community, but can’t we do more? Truly meaningful works of charity involve a sacrifice.
 
Tim Clayton is a junior majoring in narrative studies. His column “HypocriSC” runs every other Tuesday.
Are you in the greek system? If not, why are you trying to make US go through a weekend with no alcohol or parties? Why don’t we enforce it on every person in the whole university? Why target a specific group…idiocy. And plus with Rush, we already had a dry week. Come on Tim. The concept itself is fine, but it shouldn’t be applied to a certain group – especially one in which you are not a part of.

Vampire films have a mixed success rate in Hollywood. Breaking Dawn Part 1, though a critical bloodfest, raked in the money. Fright Night, more charming toward reviewers, did poorly. True Blood still draws in fans while 2007’s Moonlight barely scraped out a season. But the vampire genre hasn’t retreated back to the shadows. At least two vampire flicks are coming out in the first half of 2012: Tim Burton’s Dark Shadows and Russian director Timur Bekmambetov’s Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.
Fans of older TV shows may know of Dark Shadows, a gothic soap opera from the 60s. Easily the most popular character was Barnabas Collins, a vampire by turns courageous and callous. In Tim Burton’s adaptation, slated for May 2012, Barnabas is (oh so surprisingly) played by Johnny Depp. Michelle Pfeiffer, Eva Green and Helena Bonham-Carter co-star. Though the series focused on an entire family, the film appears to be more Barnabas-centric.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is adapted from the 2010 novel by Seth Grahame-Smith. In the story, Lincoln has a side job as a slayer of the undead, with a chip on his shoulder ever since a vampire killed his mother. The novel received mixed reviews, some praising it for its satire, others calling it a clunky mash-up about the evils of slavery. Regardless, the book was popular. Some may know Timur Bekmambetov as the director of the crazy Russian urban fantasy films Nightwatch and Daywatch. Benjamin Walker plays Lincoln, alongside Dominic Cooper and Rufus Sewell. Look for it in June 2012.
The films already have their skeptics, and neither has a trailer. The films do, however, have production ties. Tim Burton is one of the producers of Abraham Lincoln, and Seth Graham-Smith wrote the screenplay for Dark Shadows.
At the moment, Twilight and True Blood corner the market on vampires. These upcoming films offer some variety. With Burton and Bekmambetov, they look to be colorful additions.

Andrew Bird released a track called “Eyeoneye” from his newest album Break it Yourself early Monday. The track is streaming exclusively on Pitchfork. Break it Yourself is Bird’s answer to his 2009 album Noble Beast, which climbed its way to number 12 on Billboard’s 200. If previous performance is any indication of future success, Break it Yourself is most definitely an album to look out for.
Beginning at the age of four, Bird took up the violin and his ability on the instrument is nothing short of virtuosic. Bird furthered his mastery of the violin while studying Violin Performance at Northwestern University, from which he graduated in 1996. But it normally isn’t his violin playing that catches the ear so much as it is the incredibly controlled whistle he uses as a rich layer of his music.
If one is familiar with Bird’s typical sound, if there were such a thing, “Eyeoneye” certainly marks a new direction in style. Among several other sounds on the track that conjure breakout releases from bands in 2011, the fiber of “Eyeoneye” seems dyed with the influence of Seattle’s Fleet Foxes. Nevertheless, Bird always entertains and there are surely more surprises to be discovered when the full-length album is released March 6.
Bird is releasing the record on the Mom + Pop label, and a new sound isn’t the only thing he’s experimenting with. When fans buy a ticket to a show from his upcoming tour, they will also receive a digital download of the album, as well as downloads for a previously recorded live EP and a five-track live EP from the tour this spring. It is refreshing to see artists experiment with the format of their album release and it will be interesting to see how Bird’s newest album is received.
