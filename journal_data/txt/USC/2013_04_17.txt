Otana Jakpor was inspired to take action to tackle the issue of air pollution from a young age, having witnessed her mom live with severe asthma and consequent hospitalization.
However, Jakpor’s interest in health doesn’t even begin to explain why Glamour magazine chose her as one of its Top 10 College Women of 2013.
Jakpor’s firsthand experiences with air pollution inspired her to develop an interest in health, specifically dealing with the negative effects of ozone-generating air purifiers, which can intentionally produce the gas that can cause respiratory health problems.
“I’m passionate,” Jakpor said. “I really care about people’s health.”
Since then, Jakpor, a junior majoring in global health and biological sciences, has had adventures that include eating snails to holding baby monkeys to traveling to Nigeria.
In high school, Jakpor performed an experiment focused on air purification, specifically studying the effects of certain types of ozone-generating air purifiers on a person’s ability to breathe.
At the time of her experiment, the California Air Resources Board was developing regulations to limit how much ozone air purifiers could contain. During the hearing for the regulations, Jakpor said many people testified that there was no evidence supporting the claim that ozone-generating air purifiers negatively affected people’s breathing.
“It was cool as a young person, just as some random kid, to be able to say ‘Actually, they do hurt people’s breathing and I have the facts to prove it,’” Jakpor said.
Jakpor said she gained knowledge of these negative effects early on because she conducted personal experiments on her friends.
Jakpor’s testing began around Christmas time in her hometown of Riverside, Calif. In the Christmas spirit, she would invite her friends over, test their breathing by turning on the air purifier while everyone ate cookies and watched Elf, and then test their breathing again after a period of time.
“I got good at begging my friends to come to my house, eat cookies and be a test subject in my science projects,” Jakpor said to Glamour magazine.
Jakpor said she had to get her friends’ written permission to be tested, leading to some awkward invitations.
“The invitations to the parties always included consent forms for my friends to sign,” Jakpor said.
Jakpor also said that when she sees things wrong with the world, she likes to fix them — a characteristic she attributes to helping her stand out to Glamour.
“I think that Glamour liked that I was making the connection between science and real-world changes — trying to bring those areas together,” Jakpor said.
Despite the surprise of being honored, Jakpor admitted that she does not read Glamour magazine or, for that matter, any other magazines.
“I was told [I won] completely out of the blue because it was when I was in Nigeria,” she said. “It was not on my mind and not on my radar.”
One of the greatest aspects of Jakpor’s experience was meeting the other honorees.
“They did a really good job at choosing people who are doing things in very different areas,” Jakpor said. “I got to meet and hang out with people I would have never got to talk to.”
In addition to her love for science, Jakpor also loves writing. In fact, one her favorite classes at USC is Writing 340, a general-education course focused on expanding the foundation for effective writing.
“I really liked it because [my professor] challenged me to grow as a writer,” Jakpor said. “She pushed me to be much better and not to accept anything as ‘good enough.’”
In fact, if Jakpor did not already want to be a doctor, she would probably pursue a career as a children’s book author. For now, Jakpor plans on going to medical school after she graduates and is considering attending the Keck School of Medicine. She said she is also thinking about resuming her adventures and traveling outside the bubble of California.
“I’m open to anything,” Jakpor said. “I like adventure. I feel like the best sign of adventure is to be willing to go out of your comfort zone in everyday life and being okay with making a fool out of yourself sometimes.”
Outside of the classroom, Jakpor is involved in the Christian sorority Alpha Delta Chi and Overflow A Cappella, the newest a cappella group on campus. She is also interning for the American Lung Association this semester, where she is learning about policy concerning of environmental health.
It’s clear that Jakpor has plenty on her plate. But, perhaps taking the advice of her Writing 340 professor, Jakpor seemingly refuses to accept things as “good enough.”
And it’s that mentality that will no doubt inspire greater achievements from Jakpor in the future.

As finals approach, students are anxiously awaiting the end of classes and the start of summer break. But the summer could hold an unpleasant development for those with student loans. That’s because interest rates on many student loans are scheduled to jump from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1.
Costly · The Occupy protests were partly fueled by by the rising cost of higher education. The interest rate of student loans could double in July. – Courtesy of Mark Boster/Los Angeles Times
The increase, originally set to take effect last summer, was postponed for a year when Congress voted in favor of extending the current rate. Many pointed to the political nature of this decision, noting the proximity of the 2012 election and legislators’ rising awareness of the increasing electoral influence wielded by American college students.
Regardless of whether this was a calculated political move or not, the extension expires in less than two months, and  the government once again faces the same decision it did last year. Some analysts suggest that student loan debt in the United States exceeds $1 trillion, and with roughly 37 million Americans sharing in that debt, the implications of Congress’s decision will be widely felt.
Student advocacy groups have mobilized in defense of the current rate, which many argue is already too high. Several groups collectively released an issue brief on April 16 arguing against the rate increase. According to the brief, which references information from a Congressional Budget Office report, the federal government makes 36 cents on every dollar loaned, amounting to an annual profit of more than $34 billion.
President Barack Obama, along with a few Republican senators, has proposed a variable interest rate system to prevent the rate from doubling. But many Democratic legislators have suggested voting to extend the current rate for several years, giving Congress time to develop a comprehensive higher-education bill.
On a recent trip to Washington, Dean of Financial Aid Thomas McWhorter met with legislative aides of some California congressional members of Congress, including Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein.
“During my visit to the Hill, I could sense the fact that Congress is confident there will be an extension,” McWhorter said. “The question is whether it will be short- term or long-term.”
McWhorter said approximately 6,250 students currently have subsidized Stafford loans. The last time Congress increased the interest rate on subsidized federal loans was in 2006. In 2008, Congress voted to gradually decrease the rate to 3.4 percent, a rate Congress extended in 2012.
Though McWhorter remains unsure about what solution will be reached by Congress, he stressed the university’s commitment to curbing the student debt upon graduation.
“When dealing with financial aid, we try to limit the amount of loans to maintain a reasonable debt load for students,” McWhorter said.
Many students said the rise of student loan interest rules would have a long-term affect on them even after college.
“I have a friend who’s 29 and still paying off student loans,” said Maya Jackson, a sophomore majoring in film and television production. “I would definitely say it’s kind of out of hand.”
Jackson said that rising loans take focus away from the importance of education and cause more stress than necessary.
“We’re trying to get an education so we can better everything that’s going on,” Jackson said. “It makes it so much more difficult if we have other worries like money while we’re doing that.”
Jenny Kavak, a junior majoring in business administration and accounting, supports a decrease in student loan rates because ultimately, affordable education makes it easier for students to pursue their goals.
“I just think it’s sad when students use money as a reason to not go to school as well because I think that money should not be an obstacle to them getting an education,” Kavak said.

USC’s chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha, also known as Pike, will move onto The Row this summer, according to Pike President Brad Barbagallo. Pike will occupy the house at 700 West 28th St., the house previously occupied by USC’s former chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
New tenants · Sigma Phi Epsilon’s house, which is owned by the national chapter, will be leased to the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The house is owned by the national chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
“We are incredibly excited to welcome Pike back to The Row,” said Ofek Lavian, the president of the Interfraternity Council. “It goes to prove how strong their brotherhood is that they were able to maintain a strong presence on campus without actually living on The Row.”
Pike moved off of 28th Street in fall 2010, leaving the house they had occupied since 2005, which is now occupied by Phi Sigma Kappa. The brothers of Pike have not had a common place of residency since then, according to Pike President Brad Barbagallo.
Alex Urazov, a senior majoring in international relations global business and a former member of Sig Ep, said the announcement was disappointing.
“It just makes me sad,” Urazov said. “It’s unfortunate to see new letters on a place that felt like home to me.”
Though some Sig Ep members were saddened by the news, others were more optimistic about the change.
“I was happy for them,” said Perry Nunes, a sophomore majoring in economics and international relations. “But I was annoyed that I didn’t hear it from nationals.”
Though Sig Ep will be banned from The Row for up to five years, Nunes said he thinks future Sig Ep members should have access to the house once the ban is lifted.
“They shouldn’t have decisions of the past affect people five years down the line,” Nunes said. “I definitely think the national organization should grant the chapter back when they see fit.”
Something else is that when searching for a good on the internet electronics store, look for online shops that are regularly updated, keeping up-to-date with the latest products, the most effective deals, and helpful information on services. This will make sure that you are dealing with a shop that stays on top of the competition and provides you what you should need to make educated, well-informed electronics purchases. Thanks for the critical tips I have learned from the blog.
Go away freak and start that website you have always dreamed of…
Clearly this frat is cursed.  Home to several failed frats and now Pike.  I predict Pike will be gone within a year.
Look at DT breaking news before it’s actually happened!  You go Glen Coco!  
… the housing corporation hasn’t even voted yet, for Christ’s sake.  Pike is one of three being considered.  For once, Daily Trojan, could you do some fact-checking before you throw an article up online?
@ Jake,
I don’t know who you are but the deal is done with your national organization.  Your national owns the property and you and your tenants are out.  I’ll point the signed lease includes a first right of refusal with a purchase option.   Vote all you want as it means nothing!
Don’t let “our door” hit your butt on the way out!
KA ’87 – –
I find it sad that you spend your time trading blows with a student at least a quarter century your junior. Are you having “a grand old time” surfing an online college news vignette while you drift off to the days of your membership in fraternity that has literally never been relevant at USC. 
At the very least, I hope you parlayed your socially disappointing undergrad years into a motivated and successful career. My classmates and I are more accomplished, more intelligent and better looking than you and likely gunning for your job right out of the gates my man. 
Your write like the offspring of a British Lord and a fruitcake by the way. Is “shooting many a cannon” a reference to the homo-erotic brotherhood rituals you so fondly remember?
FTFO ya goon.
And what, pray tell, is your Fraternity at USC?  Or should I say “frat”, emphasis on the lower case ‘f’ that you like to so liberally apply to your writings.  Gentlemen are timeless, whether they graduate in ’13 of this century or in ’87 of the last, and you sir are no gentleman.  As an Alumni Advisor I encounter your kind all the time.  No class. Social climbing. Desperate for attention. Your Momma and Daddy have told you yuor special all your middling life.
Maybe it’s my upbringing.  Or the fact that I have never needed to work for money.  I just have money.  You can look at me as one of your betters.  And believe me Kappa Alpha Order back in the day was a site to behold.
This house used to be owned by Kappa Alpha Fraternity.  I lived in it in the 1980’s.  We shot many a cannon and had a grand old time.  As an alumni I am questioning why an upstart fraternity like Pike would be offered the property before an established and prestigious house like KA?
Kappa Alpha prestigious?  How does that work with 15 guys (now and in ’87)?
Why sir, are you insulting my great Fraternity? Our 15 gentlemen outclass your 45 douchebags and day of the year.
Are you still the same 15 guys from ’87?   If so, we’ll get one of our 50 year old bald and fat alumni to take on your entire frat.  That is as close to fair match as I can think of.
You and your “frat”, as you call it, can “roofie” your way to expulsion in a semester or two.  The Order will be waiting to take back what is rightfully ours and bring a little honor back to the Fraternity system at USC.  End of comments, I no longer will address you sir.
Pike returns to row to reclaim #1 status!

Recreated class markers, a gift from all-university honor society Skull and Dagger, were unveiled on Wednesday along Alumni Walk, which extends from Ronald Tutor Campus Center to Trousdale Parkway.
Heritage · Skull and Dagger President Jerry Papazian, Student Affairs Vice President Michael L. Jackson, former Planning Vice President Bingham Cherrie and project manager Shane Swerdlow (left to right) unveiled the markers. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The markers represent the senior class gifts to the university. The stone squares are engraved with the year of that graduating class and come in an array of designs.
During university renovations that involved demolition and reconstruction around the area, many markers from the first half of the 20th century went missing. The only surviving original marker is from the year 1925, and it was salvaged by Bing Cherrie, a former associate vice president who found it in the rubble.
“I worked for the university in a lot of areas, [including] campus development,” Cherrie said. “I was kind of surprised that [the class marker] was left in the rubble, and it seemed to be in need of saving.”
Shane Swerdlow, a 2010 USC graduate from the Marshall School of Business and the Price School of Policy Policy, was involved in executing the project. Swerdlow said that each class marker has its own unique design.
Swerdlow also said the Worthy Grand Master of Skull and Dagger Jerry Papazian came up with the idea to salvage the class markers. Papazian noted the gift was also part of commemorating the organization.
“We’re celebrating our 100th year this year, and we thought as part of that we would present a gift to the school,” Papazian said during the unveiling.
The markers are replacements of the original pieces, which were presented at the time of each class’ graduation.
According to Swerdlow, it is impossible to know if the tiles are exact replicas because the designers could only build replicas based on black-and-white photographs. The photographs are from the first generation of class markers, which range from 1897-1936, were taken at the south elevation of Founders Hall. That area would later become the Mark Taper Hall of Humanities.
“The remaining first-generation class markers are contemporary reproductions that reference the design and overall arrangement of the originals at Founders Hall,” Swerdlow said.
Swerdlow attempted to get the closest possible matches, however, by photographing areas inside Doheny Library. They viewed the photos in black and white and then matched the shades of gray from Doheny with the coloring in the original photo of the markers.
Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson also noted the significance of renovating the markers and said it completed an important part of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
“When we were designing [the] Campus Center, we had a couple things in mind,” Jackson said. “We wanted to design a facility that fit in with the tradition of USC. As we were working with the design, we had to decide what to do with this space and we said, ‘let’s call it Alumni Walk.’”
Swerdlow said the tiles are not placed symmetrically, but more abstractly and “playfully,” similar to their original design. The markers, which are divided into three panels, represent three different generations of Trojans and are diverse in their mineral makeups.
“This really represents the past, the present and the future,” Jackson said. “It’s not just history, it’s art.”
Swerdlow also emphasized that the additional adornment will add to the university’s ethos by showing off history to future generations.
“At USC, we have such a distinctive cultural identity that is unparalleled by any other university and reinforced through our unique traditions,” Swerdlow said. “Preserving forgotten traditions like the first-generation class markers … only enhances this culture.”

With nearly two weeks having passed since they last competed, the No. 8-ranked USC men’s and women’s (NR) track and field teams are anxious to get back in the spotlight.
This weekend, they finally get their chance, as they will compete at the highly competitive Mt. SAC Relays in Walnut, Calif. from April 18-20 and at the Cal State Los Angeles Twilight Meet on April 18.
The last time the Trojans competed was at the Florida Relays in Gainesville, Fla. from April 5-6.
The Mt. SAC Relays, now in its 55th year, attracts top schools around the nation annually, and the Trojans will be seeing many of their Pac-12 foes in the field, such as Oregon, UCLA and Arizona State.
Some members of the team will also be heading to the Cal State L.A. Invitational, where more than 40 universities and junior colleges will be represented.
In the Florida Relays, USC fared well on both days against top-notch competition, but the best thing that happened to the team — on the men’s side, at least — was the return of senior Bryshon Nellum, who was cleared for competition after battling injuries, and ran his first 400-meter race of the season.
He got out of the starting blocks fast and maintained his blistering pace, posting the fastest 400-meter time in the country with a winning time of 45.54.
This is nothing new for Nellum. Last season he won the Pac-12 400-meter dash title and then ran a personal best of 44.80 to qualify for the 2012 London Olympics. There, he brought home a silver medal in the 4×400 meter relay race.
In other men’s races, junior Aaron Brown, who was the Pac-12 male track athlete of the week for the week of April 1-7, won the 100m with a time of 10.15. He also placed second overall in the 200m dash with a time of 20.64.
Junior thrower Remington Conaster has had an impressive season so far. The transfer from Saddleback College moved into the top 10 of USC’s all-time hammer throw leaderboard with a mark of 219-4 at the Trojan Invitational on March 22. Hitting that mark was quite an impressive feat considering that Conaster did not even learn how to throw the hammer until the 2011 season.
Three USC women’s relay teams posted very impressive times, the most notable being the 4×100 relay team of junior Jenna Puterbaugh, junior Jessica Davis, sophomore Akawkaw Ndipagbor and junior Loudia Laarman. The group notched the top collegiate time and finished third overall with a season-best time of 44.20.
Another standout on the women’s side has been sophomore discus thrower Alexandra Collatz, who was stellar last season, when she set a USC freshman discus record in her very first meet. Collatz has continued that success this season, setting a personal best at the Cal-Nevada Championships on April 5 with a throw of 178-6, good for second on USC’s all-time list.
After this weekend, USC will have a dual meet against rival UCLA on April 27 before heading to the Pac-12 championships the following weekend.

The 2013 campaign for the USC men’s volleyball team was disappointing, to say the least.
Hampered by injury and inexperience, the Trojans did not enjoy the same level of success they had become accustomed to in past years, especially after reaching the NCAA championship match last season. Instead, they had to settle for a 6-18 record and an early end to the season as they failed to reach the playoffs.
But though the season came to a disappointing end, one Trojan received special recognition for his play: Sophomore setter Micah Christenson was named on Wednesday as a finalist for the Off the Block/Springbak, Inc. National Server of the Year Award.
The Trojan co-captain is among elite company, as the other finalists boast impressive resumes. Gonzalo Quiroga, a junior from UCLA, and Joseph Smalzer, a junior from Loyola, join Christenson as nominees, and both have accumulated over 50 aces this season.
Christenson grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii, where he was named to the 2011 Volleyball Magazine All-American team while at Kamehameha-Kapalama High School. He also served as captain of the 2012 U.S. junior national team that won a gold medal in the NORCECA Junior Continental Championship.
In his first year with the Trojans, Micah excelled as the team’s starting setter. He led the team in assists and was in the top three in a number of other categories, including digs, blocks and aces. For his efforts, he was named the 2012 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation freshman of the year.
This year, however, Christenson has taken his leadership to the next level. The sophomore led the team with 867 assists and 179 digs and was second on the team with 59 blocks.
But what Christenson excelled in — and is now being recognized for — is his unbelievable play from the service line. With 41 aces on the season, the young phenom was among the top servers in the nation and was recognized with the Off the Block nomination by a committee of more than 20 colleges.
More impressive than the statistics, however, is his ability to lead a young Trojan team. Amid a five-game losing streak, Christenson took control of the team against No. 3 Pepperdine. The All-American collected five aces on the night and helped USC capture its first victory in more than two weeks.
This season may not have gone as expected, but the award nomination is a sign of hope. By serving as a leader both on the court and off, Christenson is helping to steer this young team in the right direction. The winner of the award will be announced on Monday, April 22.
When we first commenced in business, we had our share of zombies who we had to constantly chase, who wouldn’t return calls, wouldn’t please
take a stand or truly know where they planned to go. Guns and bullets may ultimately become obsolete; so make sure
to take your better shot and strive for the head.
Those items for youths are merely included in their guardian’s survival bags.
Micah was a top notch server, his setting left something to be desired this season. Like to see you report
that a new head coach has been hired soon.

In all honesty, I shouldn’t have been so surprised.
Like many USC fans, I always keep an eye out for any schools that become subject to investigation by the NCAA and its Committee on Infractions. Naturally, as some of the NCAA’s most spurned victims, Trojan fans can’t help but become intrigued when other schools become entangled in rules violations and infractions.
But time and time again, the NCAA fails to uphold any kind of consistency in its punishments. From Ohio State to Miami, the COI has yet to hammer any school like it did USC in the Reggie Bush investigation. Even though each of the previously mentioned schools’ crimes seem much more severe than USC’s were, the penalties were nowhere near as harsh.
And each time this happens, USC fans everywhere simmer.
So when news broke of Oregon’s admission that it committed “major violations” from 2008-11 under former head football coach Chip Kelly, who is now with the NFL’s Philadelphia Eagles, I should not have been so shocked to read Oregon’s ludicrous suggestion of two years’ probation and one scholarship loss per year for the next three years as a self-imposed penalty.
Granted, the NCAA has not agreed with this suggestion and has yet to make a ruling on what kind of punishment Oregon deserves. It could very well enforce a much stiffer penalty in real life.
But let’s not kid ourselves.
Oregon’s alleged crime is that it paid $25,000 to Willie Lyles, owner of the Houston-based Complete Scouting Services. Companies of this kind are commonly used by colleges to provide them with written reports on high school players in various regions of the country.
But Oregon is alleged to have received oral reports from Lyles, which is a no-no. Additionally, when the school was forced to release the documents that it received from Lyles in return for its $25,000 payment, it was revealed many of the reports on players were outdated, raising suspicion as to what exactly Oregon was paying for.
Shortly before Lyles received payment from Oregon, former five-star running back recruit Lache Seastrunk of Houston signed a letter of intent with Oregon. Lyles was a mentor to Seastrunk, which is a great cause for suspicion for the NCAA.
In an interview with Yahoo! Sports, Lyles said that he had not given the Oregon coaching staff any written reports on recruits. The NCAA’s interest in this case is that oral reports on recruits are prohibited under current rules.
In addition to his relationship with Seastrunk, Lyles has connections with other former Texas prep stars, including LaMichael James, Tra Carson, Dontae Williams and Marcus Davis, who all went on to play at Oregon.
If it was possible to prove that Lyles guided these players to commit to Oregon, the Ducks would have a serious issue on their hands. Severe penalties would be forthcoming, including massive scholarship losses and bowl bans.
But that is not going to happen. Oregon will receive a slap on the wrist, something slightly more severe than its proposed self-imposed sanctions of three lost scholarships and two years of probation.
Given the NCAA’s recent history of punishments, Ducks fans should have nothing to worry about. In 2010, five Ohio State players were found to have received improper benefits after selling football memorabilia. Moreover, it was discovered that former head coach Jim Tressel not only knew about the infractions, but lied about them and tried to cover them up.
The news of the infractions broke shortly before Ohio State was to play Arkansas in the 2011 Sugar Bowl. The NCAA ruled that the players, despite being ruled ineligible, were allowed to participate in the game, but had to sit out the first five games of the following season.
To me, this is the most egregious of all the NCAA’s failures. I can’t think of many more ways that a school could have blatantly broken the rules, yet Ohio State’s final punishment was a one-year bowl ban and a loss of nine scholarships.
That’s less than half the sanctions USC was given after the NCAA could not find that any member of USC’s athletic department knew about Bush’s alleged improper benefits; no, the COI ruled that USC “should have known,” and the Trojans were doomed.
To be fair, the NCAA has been open about its practices. In the “Penalties” section of the NCAA’s official website, the page reads: “The committee decides penalties case-by-case. Each case is unique, and applying case precedent is difficult (if not impossible) because all cases are different.”
So at least when people (including myself) complain that the NCAA lacks consistency in its rulings on infractions, you can’t say they didn’t warn us.

With just one final hurdle to clear before the postseason begins, the USC women’s tennis team, which sits at No. 5 in the nation, puts its perfect 9-0 Pac-12 record on the line today at Marks Stadium against crosstown rival UCLA.
One last step · With the postseason right around the corner, USC senior Danielle Lao has the women’s tennis team focused on UCLA. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“We’re doing great with everyone healthy and ready to go,” USC head coach Richard Gallien said. “We will be at our best and try to stay the hunter against the hunted. We love to beat UCLA, but we also love to beat Cal and Cal State Northridge, so we try to not make it too personal because that is when players start to get tight.”
The Women of Troy have not lost since Feb. 23 against Cal and have steamrolled through conference foes ever since. But their 20-2 overall record will be put to the test against the No. 7 Bruins (16-4, 7-2 Pac-12). UCLA will be looking to exact revenge against USC after the Bruins’ 4-2 loss at home on March 8 extended the Women of Troy’s winning streak.
Despite USC having wrapped up at least a share of the  regular-season Pac-12 title, this match takes on greater importance when you consider the bad blood between the two schools. USC has not defeated the Bruins in back-to-back matches since 2006, adding an extra incentive to play well in the season’s final regular-season match.
The Women of Troy will look to extend their winning streak to a season-high 13 matches and keep their unblemished home record intact.
Led by No. 2-ranked sophomore Sabrina Santamaria and No. 8-ranked senior Danielle Lao, USC faces an equally tough challenge across the net, as the Bruins boast five players ranked nationally in singles play.
Santamaria’s likely opponent will be No. 3 Robin Anderson, and the two look to face off against each other on court one during both the singles and doubles’ portion of the match. Junior Kaitlyn Christian and Santamaria remain undefeated in doubles play, despite the fact that they recently dropped to No. 2 in the nation, and they will match up against the No. 19-ranked tandem of Anderson and Skylar Morton.
Though Christian and Santamaria remain focused on playing rather than on their ranking, Gallien was displeased with the decision to drop them a spot.
“[Their drop to No. 2] is inexplicable, and I think if you even ask the Georgia team that is ahead of them, they won’t have an explanation,” Gallien said. “Kaitlyn and Sabrina won two national championships this fall, though, and they will continue to play strong tennis and lead our doubles.”
The top half of the singles lineup for USC will once again be depended upon to set the tone of the match, just as it did in the team’s 4-2 win earlier in the season. Santamaria, Lao and sophomore Zoë Scandalis, who is ranked No. 30 in the country, all won their matches handily in USC’s last meeting with UCLA.
Junior Gabriella DeSimone also showed resiliency in her March 8 meeting, as she went on to defeat UCLA’s Chanelle Van Nguyen in three sets after losing the first set 6-0.
In uncharacteristic fashion, USC dropped the doubles point in its last match against UCLA and may be looking to make a few changes heading into this bout.
“We may tinker with our doubles lineups moving forward,” Gallien said. “But whoever we throw out there will be ready to fight and play hard.”
With a win over UCLA, USC would clinch its second straight Pac-12 title after sharing the crown with Stanford last season. A victory would also give the team its first outright conference championship since 2009.
After last year’s performance against the Bruins, which not only included losses in three of four matches but also saw UCLA knock USC out of the NCAA tournament, a sweep of the season series would be a boon for a USC team looking to build momentum as it heads into postseason play.
“Our girls are excited, and I don’t need to throw fuel on the fire to get them excited for this match,” Gallien said.

USC announced Wednesday that members of the school’s men’s and women’s tennis teams will represent the United States in the 27th World University Games in Kazan, Russia, from July 6-17.
For country · USC junior Ray Sarmiento of the men’s tennis team will lead a coalition of members from both the men’s and women’s tennis teams as they compete for America at the World University Games. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
USC men’s tennis head coach Peter Smith, men’s assistant coach Krzysztof Kwinta and women’s associate coach West Nott will helm the national team, which is composed entirely of USC players.
The USC men’s and women’s tennis teams are two of the best collegiate tennis teams in the nation. The men’s side is the                                                                            four-time defending NCAA champion and is currently ranked No. 4 in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. The Women of Troy are also a highly regarded tennis program, currently ranked No. 5 in the nation by the ITA.
The men’s side will send junior co-captains Ray Sarmiento and Michael Grant, as well as sophomores Eric Johnson and Jonny Wang. Each member of the men’s side is ranked by the ITA, with Sarmiento ranked No. 14 in the nation, Johnson ranked No. 65, Wang ranked No. 96 and Grant ranked No. 101.
Sarmiento, who was also recently named Pac-12 player of the week for his efforts in a sweep of Washington and Oregon on the weekend, was initially planning to participate in professional events this summer but put those plans on hold for the World University Games.
“When coach asked me about playing in Russia, I could not turn down competing in Russia and representing USC and my country,” Sarmiento said. “It will be awesome.”
For other players, going to Russia is a chance to broaden horizons on a personal level.
“It’s a real privilege to represent both USC and the United States,” Wang said. “I’m looking forward to seeing the wide variety of different people and cultures in Kazan.”
The women’s side will send junior Kaitlyn Christian, sophomores Sabrina Santamaria and Gabriella DeSimone, and freshman Ellie Yates. Santamaria is ranked No. 2 in the nation in the ITA women’s singles rankings, while teammate DeSimone is ranked No. 75.
Both the men’s and women’s teams wrap up their regular seasons against crosstown rival UCLA. The women play today at Marks Stadium, while the men play on Friday in Westwood, Calif.
Following the conclusion of the regular season, the Pac-12 men’s and women’s championship tournament will take place in Ojai, Calif. The men’s Pac-12 championship will begin on April 23, with the women’s championship starting on April 25.
Following the conference tournaments, the NCAA team championships will be held in Urbana, Ill. The men’s tournament is slated to begin May 16, and the Trojans will be gunning for their fifth consecutive national championship. The women’s team championships will start on May 17. Both the men’s and women’s NCAA individual championships will begin on May 22.
The World University Games (termed “Universiades,” a portmanteau of the words “university” and “Olympiad”) have existed in various forms since 1923, when the inaugural international collegiate event was held in Paris, France.
The United States leads in gold medals and total medals at the event, with 443 and 1155, respectively. In the 2011 Universiades, South Korea took home the gold medal, while USA was not among competitors in the tournament field.

Somehow, it’s not quite the same as running into George Clooney.
As native Angelenos know, casually bumping into movie stars is a likely possibility. A chance meeting can occur while waiting for a table at L.A. Live, standing in the luggage queue at LAX or even just walking the streets of Beverly Hills. And when it happens, many of us are reduced to starstruck admirers, unapologetically speechless as we confront the people who embody our favorite film characters.
With authors, however, the interaction is a bit different. Sure, some of our favorite novelists might be just as attractive and charismatic as Hollywood icons, but when their written creations are laid out on the blank page before us, we feel a certain closeness that we don’t necessarily get with stars of the screen.
Perhaps this feeling of intimacy comes with navigating the relationship between “creator” and “created.” Musicians, for example, usually gain respect when listeners learn that they have written their own lyrics or composed their own songs.
Artists simply feel more “authentic” if they’ve taken the time to put their own feelings — whether imaginary or not — on paper.
Imagine, for example, if Eminem didn’t write his own songs. Even for an artist who’s been criticized for his masochistic lyrical tendencies, the Grammy-winning rapper has earned respect for his unflinching ability to talk about his experiences with bullying and fatherhood in songs such as “Brain Damage” and “Hailie’s Song.”
And say what you like about Taylor Swift, but no one can deny that she’s not afraid to share her emotions when she’s discussing her friend Abigail in “Fifteen” or telling Drew “he’s the reason for the teardrops on her guitar.”
For authors, however, negotiating the territory between “creator” and “created” is a little ickier. As creative writers know, it’s extremely difficult to isolate yourself from the characters and worlds you create. Personal experiences creep in through the nouns and adjectives. Inner hopes and fears weave their way into character descriptions and plot development. Even though a story might not be true, per se, it is still an inseparable part of the one who created it.
Perhaps that’s why events like the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books draw so much attention. This weekend, the festival celebrates its 18th year of existence and its third year on USC’s campus. Last year, the Festival of Books drew more than 100,000 attendees, all lovers of literature who were eagerly anticipating a chance to get their hands on some rare books or interact with their favorite writers. Eric Jerome Dickey, Anne Rice and Julie Andrews all made appearances, dazzling crowds with their insightful takes on literature and the writing process.
This year, the so-called literary “headliners” feature everyone from Joyce Carol Oates to Lemony Snicket to Jamaica Kincaid, and fans of their works can easily spend more than an hour simply waiting in line for a three-second encounter with the admired authors.
But why is meeting an author in person accompanied by so much enthusiasm? Perhaps it’s because readers realize that by enjoying a particular novel, they are, in essence, enjoying a writer’s mental space. Unlike movie stars, who fit themselves into the predetermined molds of their characters, writers create the space being filled, starting from scratch as they ingrain themselves in each persona and detail.
When talking about the beloved characters in Harry Potter, for example, meeting Daniel Radcliffe or Emma Watson has a different connotation than meeting J.K. Rowling. Radcliffe might be charming as the loyal Harry, but Rowling, as the author, is Harry. She’s inhabited his mind, formed his history and mannerisms. And, yes, she might be lacking a lightning-shaped scar on her forehead, but Harry’s psychology has been wrought out of Rowling’s own reality and imagination.
This week, attendees at the Festival of Books will get the chance to interact with A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Count Olaf just by attending Snicket’s Saturday reading. And Offred of A Handmaid’s Tale will make an appearance in Bovard Auditorium as author Margaret Atwood engages in a conversation with KCRW’s Michael Silverblatt.
I exaggerate to make a point, but when we meet our favorite writers, it’s undeniable that we are meeting the psychologies and ideologies of the people who have touched us with their stories.
When reading the likes of Dana Johnson’s Elsewhere, California, for example, readers are essentially engaging with California and Los Angeles the way the author sees it.
And perhaps the author of Inkheart, Cornela Funke, never found herself physically trapped inside the world of a book, but underneath it all, there’s a startling metaphor about the joys of good literature. Fans of Inkheart certainly won’t have experiences battling the evil Capricorn, but they will understand that a story can capture your attention and feel just as tangible as their everyday realities — just as Funke intends them to.
It is the philosophy of these authors and the chance to recognize our own fears and hopes in other people that gets our blood pumping at the prospects of meeting them.
Sure, we might joke that authors are playing God as they create a world and characters that capture our hearts. But more importantly, we can realize that they are also playing themselves.

Whether its neon, chemical elements or logarithmic coasters, Los Angeles’ newest online novelty home goods store, B+ Shop, has you covered for your geeky accessory needs.
Talk nerdy to me · B+ Shop’s founder Byron Samayoa said he created the online accessory store to show off how science can be exciting and fun. – Courtesy of Byron Samayoa
Opened in 2012, the store’s name is inspired by a very simple reason — it matches owner Byron Samayoa’s academic traits.
“My name is Byron and I was never a straight A-plus student,” he said. “I was definitely more of a B-plus student.”
According to Samayoa, B+ Shop is supposed to be out of the box.
“[I want to] bring the awesomeness of science from the sterility of laboratory and field to your home,” he said.
He emphasized that the purpose of B+ Shop is to create a home-ware products store that offers accessories related to specific academic subjects.
“I try to combine the three things I really enjoy — science, math and home-ware design,” Samayoa said.
In fact, this whole venture resulted from how much Samayoa loved those three things. Samayoa said he really just wanted to have a set of coasters with some periodic table elements on it and decided to go ahead and make it.
What pushed him to create a legitimate business, however, was the fact that his last business — a taco truck website — had just fallen through.
“The thought that this would be another idea that I started and left by the wayside really drove me to get it up and running,” Samayoa said. “Regardless, if no one bought any product, I just really wanted to launch this store.”
Though it did take some time to develop products and figure out the logistics, B+ Shop is now up and running smoothly. It’s a long process — each set he makes, packages and ships, involved materials and work from about six different vendors.
“Coming up with the new idea is the easy part; finding the manufacturer who makes a 4x4x1 cardboard tuck box will drive you mad,” he said.
Though the B+ Shop is currently online only, Samayoa does have some plans for expansion. According to him, setting up an online shop was the easiest way of testing if there was any sort of audience for his line of products. He’s also looking to make more items and expand to more bar-ware, glassware and utensils.
“Maybe in the deep future, I think if I got a large collection of in-house designed products and curated products, I’d consider a physical store,” he said. “But, currently with a full-time job, online is what time allows.”
That being said, he is not planning on officially adding anyone to his payroll anytime soon.
“Though on paper I’m a one-man show, I’ve received and continue to receive helpful feedback from my customers and a few close friends who range in backgrounds, who I’ve come to consider my trusted advisers,” he said. “But no plans to have anyone on the books.”
In terms of reaching a wider audience, his current marketing strategy has focused on social media and a couple of DIY fairs. His aim right now has been mainly to get his name out there and reach not only students, but anyone who shares science or math tendencies.
“I’m my own customer, I suppose, and my target customers are grown-up nerds, like myself. No particular age group.”
It seems as if this strategy has been working, since he has a devoted customer base that continuously prides him with positive feedback. Of all the coasters, he said, people seem to like his neon coaster set the best.
“It’s definitely more eye-catching,” he said, “but many of my customers prefer a solid wooden coaster. Just depends on your aesthetic.”
He also said a good amount of the customers he’s had are very excited about science or have friends who are very excited about science and are getting gifts for them, which made him optimistic and enthusiastic about the overall response to his products.
“I’m a science nerd who is testing a hypothesis,” he said. “If I make things I’d buy, maybe other grown-up nerds will too.”
In terms of new products, customers can expect a few molecule coaster sets coming up in the next week or so. Samayoa said that he has plenty of ideas for B+ Shop and plans in the future to  branch out to other subjects, including math, anatomy and even English Literature. And as far as glassware is concerned, he promised that he did have something coming up that should complement any home bar.
“Coming up with new products is the best part of the job,” he said. “It’s a combination of letting the mind wander to new ideas as crazy as they get, and then making them practical and problem-solving for fabrication’s sake.”

In the revival years of garage rock, no one screeched without inhibition quite like Karen O. Flanked by the equally raucous duo of Nick Zinner (on guitar and keyboard) and Brian Chase (drums), O fronted the rise of Yeah Yeah Yeahs into stardom based on the band’s ability to do as it pleased.
Strong vocals · Mosquito separates itself from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ previous albums partly thanks to Karen O’s utilization of her singing range, which is shown off in the melancholy “Despair” and the hypnotic “Always.” – Courtesy of Yeah Yeah Yeahs
 
Now on its fourth studio album, the band understands what to do to get attention — take, for instance, the members’ eye-catching fashions or the band’s controversial cover of a baby being grabbed by a giant mosquito. But Yeah Yeah Yeahs also knows how to create a signature sound to keep its fan base growing.
Mosquito feels a little calmer than previous albums, but maybe that’s because the band now has little to prove. Listeners have consistently gotten serious doses of O’s fantastic, often hysterical vocals, especially in the 2003 album Fever to Tell. From the start of the band, fans couldn’t escape the crunchy riffs, swift changes in tempo and risky melodies that accompanied the songs and the rest of their albums.
So it almost makes sense that Mosquito sounds mostly atmospheric. It’s a chilled-out version of the band, for the most part. The exceptions include zany title tracks that load tons of fun into somewhat creepy lines about — you guessed it — YYY’s favorite bug, the mosquito. O whispers creepily at the listener from the beginning, later talking about the mosquito’s freaky abilities. “They can you see / but you can’t see them,” she informs the listener in a slick breakdown. “Were you itching when they called your name?”
O even starts buzzing during some parts of the song, and the guitar puts out riff after riff, heightening the tension of the whole track. It might just be a song about a small creature, but the whimsy is there and the musicality is on point.
The fun continues in “Area 52,” which takes on aliens. As O sings, another digital voice sings along, blending in with the melody. “Take me as your prisoner / I wanna be an alien,” O pleads as Chase drives the rhythm with a solid set of drum beats.
But any diehard YYY fan knows the band can do softer, calmer songs with just as much finesse. The more melancholy tones of O’s voice shine on “Despair,” which uses a simple rhythm with a repetitive melody that O manipulates with emotional changes in pitch. Eventually, Chase brings in a few resonant drum beats and the guitars amp up in noise but the song structure still feels simple. It’s pulled off effortlessly, yet the sentiment feels sincere.
“Subway” gets more abstract in its sound, with the initial beat imitating the move of a train over the tracks. O’s layered voice made the reverb even richer. The song’s rhythm doesn’t work as well though, with the sound of the tracks getting more and more overwhelming as the song nears its end.
The track doesn’t grab your attention as much as others on the album, but if YYY fans yearned for a slightly different sound than presented in previous albums, they can find it here. They just need to realize their ears might be subjected to the incessant sound of train wheels on tracks for more than a minute.
Though “Always” takes its time ending — not to mention getting the word “always” stuck in the listener’s head — the track descent into a flurry of light keyboard notes with resounding bass notes makes it feels more mellow than other, more prototypical YYY tracks. At the same time though, it plays to the band’s strength to show off its ability to create grungy, fast-tempoed tracks in addition to more pensive ones.
Yet the song structure doesn’t feel like it has a risk to it. The song’s melody at the beginning repeats throughout the song, which makes it start to feel expected. That changes however, when the melody leads up to an electronic-heavy outro that distorts O’s voice so that it almost sounds like the playing of keyboard notes. It’s intriguing for some time but feels unnecessary as O has the vocal chops to impress without the need of technological manipulation.
Surprising at turns, disappointing at some but overall reassuring, Mosquito does not fully represent the unbridled talent and fantastically quirky talent of the trio. It proves refreshing in its new approach but the band need not lag their songs so much. After all, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs always shine brightest — like arguably all garage rock bands do, no matter the era — when their music is quick and dirty.

An Albany, NY teacher should be ashamed for assigning an essay putting students in the shoes of Nazis.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
According to USA Today, the teacher asked her students to “argue that Jews are evil, and use solid rationale from government propaganda to convince me of your loyalty to the Third Reich!”
Students were then instructed to read and watch Nazi propaganda to provide evidence for their papers and convince their teacher that Jews were the source of Germany’s problems, according to the Times Union. In other words, they had to think like a Nazi and rationalize the horrific acts that were perpetuated during the Holocaust and the millions of deaths that resulted from Adolf Hitler’s reign.
Needless to say, students and parents were outraged by the offensive assignment and the issue was immediately brought to the attention of the New York school. Approximately one-third of the students refused to write the essay, which had been given to three different classes, Albany Superintendent Marguerite Vanden Wyngaard said in a press conference.
The students who refused to do the assignment should be applauded for not going along with the insensitive project, even though the school claims that the teacher’s only intention was to challenge students to see the power of a persuasive argument. The importance of crafting persuasive rhetoric is a lesson that all schools need to teach, but forcing students to write from this specific point of view about one of the worst incidents in human history is not the way to go about it.
The amount of prompts the teacher could have chosen instead is infinite: The assignment could have been to “write a persuasive argument to your parents on why you should be allowed to stay up later than your current curfew” or “write an essay to the mayor on why you think the cement in front of the school should be repaved.”
Instead, the teacher chose one of the worst possible prompts and worded it in an incredibly insensitive way, making the class a member of one of the most vicious and hated regime in the past 200 years. In this case, these students were underlings — underlings that must prove themselves or face metaphorical prosecution in the form of a failed grade. This was a mockery of the pain and suffering of millions of people; it was an insult to the men, women and children who were raped, starved, shot or gassed to death during a madman’s reign.
Whether the teacher was attempting to influence students with his or her own possibly anti-Semitic sentiments or not, any teacher who is incapable of racial and political sensitivity should not be teaching the nation’s young minds.
If anything, they need to go back to school themselves and take a course on World War II and maybe even take a visit to the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York. Perhaps then they’d be more conscientious of their students’ needs and sensibilities.

Bold teachers should be celebrated for pushing and challenging their students in a way studying facts alone cannot.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
Forcing a 16-year-old to memorize the dates of the Holocaust and the number of people murdered solely serves to dehumanize and impersonalize the story — it becomes a statistic, rather than a tragedy. The actions taken by Adolf Hitler and the citizenry he commanded are so unfathomable that for many young students learning about Nazi Germany for the first time, it doesn’t seem real. Instead, it only exists as something that occurred long ago in a world far away, something that could never happen today.
Therefore, when students sit idly by in a history class, remembering statistics and facts, the most important lesson is brushed aside. There were people who put Hitler in power — people who, at the time, were often just average citizens. To argue otherwise is to trivialize the problem and fail to address the fundamental nature of what caused the Holocaust in the first place.
This is what people need to understand about the uproar surrounding the Albany teacher who assigned a controversial writing assignment. Though the actual assignment could have been presented better, it nevertheless had the chance to help students comprehend how and why a radical, malevolent leader can back a society into a corner and take advantage of it.
It’s critical that we do not try to soften history, no matter how difficult it is, in order to shield young people from the unpleasant truth. Doing so is not only disrespectful to the victims — but it also does a disservice to students and sets a disturbing precedent for our nation’s schools, one in which history is removed from the history books.
This teacher should not face personal or professional consequences for the assignment. Instead, the teacher should be applauded for attempting to teach his or her students something more than arbitrary dates and statistics, even if the attempt was ill-fated.
It’s no secret that education in the United States is failing. And as we dive further and further into the information age, knowledge of facts and dates becomes less critical. As this access to information becomes ubiquitous, critical thinking becomes the critical skill, a skill hindered by this specific district’s refusal to push boundaries and challenge kids.
Perhaps the teacher’s assignment was a bit of a miscalculation. But with America’s school system falling fast with no sign of recovery, should we really burn a teacher at the stake for trying something new?
Instead, administrators and faculty should work with them to improve the writing assignment so it has the same effect while still remaining sensitive to cultural issues. And regardless, fellow teachers should be encouraged to push students out of their comfort zone.
Though he or she might not have discovered the secret to turning our education system around, they did try something new. And that is admirable because if there’s one thing both sides can agree on, it’s that the status quo is broken.
Michael Windes is a sophomore majoring in business administration.
That assignment to think like a Nazi, write like a Nazi and justify hideous, beast-like activity in support for mass murder is not “creative.” It is rather horrific and shows terrible judgment. “Creative?” “Imaginative?” “Stimulating?” No. Just terrible judgment by an immature or thoughtless teacher.
If you think about writing assignments, speaking assignments or similar educational tasks, you can come up with plenty of vile subjects about real life. Discuss them, yes. Research and write about them, sure. But requiring that the students assume and write monstrous positions as their own is another matter. It is not helpful in teaching students how to use their intelligence, nor what the values are an ethical society. And it is appalling that a teacher could be so witless and uncomprehending.
Let’s say the teacher wanted the students to “argue that Old White men are evil, and use solid rationale from government propaganda to convince me of your loyalty to the Republican Party!” That teacher would not only be honored by the educational establishment but would have most likely been offered a adjunct professorship at USC by Provost Garrett.

This weekend is all about original productions—and it’s also definitely a weekend to support your creative peers. The most wonderful part of student-produced work is that even if a scene doesn’t work, you are able to appreciate the immense amount of hard work that went into putting up the show in the first place. It is an opportunity to really see how students grow and learn, while hopefully being entertained in the process.
First up is a show by a brand new student group, INTERP: A Night Of Theater Abridged. The show consists of actors performing scenes from different movies and books as one or two men shows. The concept is derived from high school speech and debate programs, in an event coined “interpretation of literature.”
The directors of the show, Ben Greene and David Mandell, both participated in the event in high school, and each actor chose his own material and rehearsed individually. I’m particularly interested in the one-man show of Downton Abbey, a performance that is sure to be a riot. The show runs Thursday at 8pm, Friday at 6 pm in the VKC arches (another fun element to experience) and it is free!
The other two shows for the weekend are written by students. This weekend premieres the bi-annual Brand New Theatre (BNT) One Acts, this time titled Supernatural Selection. The show features four student-written, acted, directed, designed one-acts. This show is always a fantastic display of the talent at USC, and I’m sure this year will be no different. One play is written by senior Jordan Merimee, whose most recent show, the thought-provoking Blind Me Tender, premiered at USC in February. Jordan is a veteran to BNT, and this will likely be his last new work to premiere at USC. (But I’m sure we’ll hear his name out in the “real world” in the near future!).
Two of the shows are also written by members of USC’ famed improv group, Commedus Interuptus. If their ability to make us laugh on the fly is any indication, I’m sure giving them some time to write their material will make it even better. Check out the BNT One Acts Supernatural Selection, this Thursday-Saturday at the Village Gate Theater in University Village. Visit brandnewtheatreusc.com for tickets.
This week also marks the second week of the School of Dramatic Arts (SDA) New Works festival, involving full-length plays written by second-year MFA dramatic writing students. The production this week is called Tales from Tent City and weaves words and song to tell the stories of homeless youth living on the streets of America. They must learn to create and dissolve bonds, and learn the best plan of action to survive and thrive in their situation. This production has gotten particular buzz for its original music, scored by an undergraduate cast member. The show runs April 19-21 at the Massman theater, tickets are available online or at the door.

The first month of the baseball season means little to me. It seems as though every year some team that has no business being in first finds themselves at the top of the standings come late April. The first month can be completely deceptive, like when the 2005 Houston Astros began their season 15-30 only to end up in the World Series. That being said, most teams are approaching (or have passed) the 15 game mark and I have some major misgivings about a few,  namely the Los Angeles Angels.
The Angels went on a shopping spree last offseason that was only eclipsed by the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers. But while the Blue Jays and Dodgers merely took advantage of underperforming teams (the Marlins and Red Sox respectively) via trade, the Angels spent an unprecedented amount of money on the free agent market on marquee names. So far, the return has been less than stellar.
If this story sounds familiar, that’s because you’ve heard it before. In the summer of 2012, the Angels made the biggest splash of the offseason by signing the coveted Albert Pujols to a 10-year, $240 million dollar contract. Despite having the highest payroll in the division, the Angels missed the playoffs that season after falling behind both the A’s and the Rangers, partially thanks to an underperforming Pujols. And despite spending even more money this year to land the highly desired Josh Hamilton, the Angels look like they will not be playoff bound if they continue to play like they have the first two weeks.
Underperforming as a team is never good, but with a payroll this high it is unacceptable. The Angels are 4-10 as of Wednesday afternoon. That’s four wins in 14 games. Since we know their payroll is about $128 million, let us do some math. In 14 games, they’ve spent about $9 million and they have only managed four wins. Each win is costing them nearly $2.5 million. It’s unreal. And the lack of production isn’t coming from the younger or inexperienced players, but instead from the very guys that the Angels have devoted their payroll to.
Combined, Pujols and Hamilton are being paid over $33 million this season. That’s more than the entire Astros roster. Yet, these two have only managed a .238 batting average and 4 home runs in their first 14 games. Hamilton has accumulated more strikeouts than hits, as the lack of production from both players is completely to blame for the Angels’ early-season failures. It is unreal to me that these proven athletes can underperform so badly after receiving such massive contracts.
But there is hope. It is not rare to see teams turn it around after a poor start, and I would not be surprised to see the Angels catch fire and take the AL West despite their dismal start. Things have to change first though. Until Pujols and Hamilton start playing at the level they’re being paid for, the Angels will continue to drop the ball.

As cell phones across campus lit up with the breaking news of Monday’s Boston Marathon bombing, many students called loved ones in Boston to check about their well-being.
Just before 3 p.m. on the East Coast, a blast rang through the crowd that had collected on Boylston Street, just before the finish line of the 26.2 mile race. Seconds later and about a football field-and-a-half away, a second bomb detonated, no doubt confirming the darkest fears of everyone present. Chaos ensued as spectators and runners bolted from the bloody scene, unsure of where they could find safety and dreading any subsequent explosions. According to The New York Times, the attack left three dead, including an 8-year-old who was among the spectators. Officials said more than 150 people were injured.
A day later, many students continue to react to the bombing with both lingering shock and deepening sadness.
“I first heard about the bombing when I saw it on the TV at Ronald Tutor Hall, and then I continued to follow the story throughout the day,” said Kathryn Daniels, a graduate student studying biomedical engineering.
Daniels said the events reminded her of other tragic events in the United States’ recent past and noted the frightening nature of such sudden attacks.
“There’s been so many of these events that have happened over the past year, with the Colorado shooting and Newtown, so its tough not to be scared. But you have to live your life and keep going,” Daniels said.
Despite commentaries attributing the attack to a terrorist, most students remain aware that no culprit has yet been identified.
“I feel that this is somewhat of an isolated incident, and there seems to be the general impression around the country that this was a terrorist act. But we really don’t know yet. The question remains as to who is responsible, and what was their motive,” said Will Getz, a junior majoring in chemistry and East Asian languages and cultures.
Initial media reports announced that two additional explosives had been found but were not detonated, but Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick invalidated these reports in a press conference Tuesday morning. The only two bombs on the scene were those that exploded, he said.
The federal government has said that no terror organization has claimed responsibility. Police took a Saudi Arabian man into custody for questioning immediately following the blasts, but media reports suggest that he is not associated at all with the attack. No suspect has been declared, and the FBI is continuing its investigation on the matter.
Cecilia Sweet-Coll, a freshman majoring in animation and digital arts, grew up in Boston but did not know anyone involved in the bombing. Sweet-Coll’s chief concern surrounded the racial animosities that she’s seen since the explosions occurred.
“A lot the responses I’ve seen have been virulently racist, and that scares me,” Sweet-Coll said. “There’s been a lot of anti-Muslim and anti-Korean sentiment.”
Meanwhile, university administrators have worked to ensure the well-being of students who may have been directly or indirectly harmed in the blasts.
“As with all tragedies, the first thing we think about is are there students who are affected,” said Lynette Merriman, a senior associate dean of students who heads the crisis management team at USC. “We typically have several students who participate in the marathon each year, so we reached out to Recreational Sports in the Division of Student Affairs and we were provided with a few names of students who ran in the Boston Marathon, and thankfully they are all okay.”
Merriman said the administration has reached out to students who are from and have family in the Boston area. They have also informed students of the many avenues of support that are available at the university.
“At Student Affairs we are always concerned about the stretch of the net we cast. The important thing is that any time someone in our community becomes aware of a student in distress — whether due to what happened in Boston or for other, personal reasons — that they reach out and inform them of the support network we have here,” Merriman said.
