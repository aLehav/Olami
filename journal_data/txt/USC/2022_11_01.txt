As the Nov. 8 midterm election approaches, voters across the country are reading up on their local elections and candidates to determine who they will cast their ballots for when the time comes. 
California’s 37th congressional district encompasses USC and Expo Park, as well as the neighborhoods of South Los Angeles, Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Miracle Mile, Pico-Robertson, Century City, Cheviot Hills, West Los Angeles and Mar Vista. Candidates in this year’s primary and general elections seek to replace current Congressional Rep. Karen Bass, who is running for the L.A. Mayoral seat. 
While the CA-37 primary featured seven candidates, California’s “top two” system — a procedure in which the leading two vote-getters from the primary face off in the general election — pushed only Sydney Kamlager and Jan Perry, both USC alumnae, to this November’s ballot. 
Sydney Kamlager is a current member of California’s State Senate, representing its 30th district since March 2021. Previously, she was a member of the State Assembly, representing its 54th district from 2018 to 2021 after winning a special election for the seat. 
Kamlager served on several committees in both government bodies, including the Rules Committee, Communications and Conveyance Committee and the Public Safety Committee in the State Assembly as well as the Public Safety Committee, Rules Committee, Appropriations Committee, Budget and Fiscal Review Committee and the Human Services Committee in the State Senate. 
While in these government bodies, she sponsored — and cosponsored — bills such as the CRISES Act, the Street Medicine Act, Guaranteed Health Care for All, the California Abolition Act, the Plastic Pollution Reduction Act and the Affordable Prescription Drug Act. 
According to her campaign website, Kamlager is prioritizing issues of voting rights, reproductive justice, healthcare, affordable housing and climate change. Kamlager’s site does not elaborate on these priorities; however, in a statement to the Daily Trojan, Kamlager outlined what she believes to be her top issues for the campaign. 
“We have an obligation to provide healthcare that is affordable, accessible and of high quality — to every single person,” Kamlager wrote. “I believe that health care for everyone is a human right.”
Kamlager also wrote that she will prioritize fighting voter suppression — in part by passing the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act — and protecting abortion rights. 
The Senator expanded on her stance on abortion, writing, “I authored legislation to codify that Los Angeles County is a Safe Haven/Abortion Access county and supported Prop 1 to enshrine reproductive healthcare as a right in our state’s constitution. We need to offer this playbook to other counties and states across the country.” 
Kamlager expressed her desire to oversee federal legislation related to criminal justice reform, citing her experience with eliminating pro-slavery clauses from the California State Constitution. 
“We have to talk about economic and criminal justice together and make sure policies are fair, just and include due process,” she wrote. 
Kamlager is endorsed by Rep. Bass, Senator Alex Padilla, Rep. Adam Schiff and the California Democratic Party, just a few among her supporters listed on her campaign website. 
Jan Perry is currently the executive director of the Infrastructure Funding Alliance, “a national initiative to meet future infrastructure, economic development, and environmental challenges.” She previously ran the City of L.A. Economic and Workforce Development Department and served as the L.A. City Councilmember for District 9 from 2001 to 2013. 
Perry co-authored “Proposition O,” which worked to better water in L.A. through a number of measures such as “upgrading storm drain systems, eliminating flooding, creating community parks, and improving water quality.” She also developed two areas of man-made wetlands and supported the construction of 5,670 affordable housing units and “permanent supportive housing” for formerly houseless individuals. 
Perry’s website writes that she will prioritize a wide range of issues in her campaign. She is in support of congressional measures to expand access to affordable healthcare and wants to hire more healthcare professionals to serve both urban and rural areas. 
Perry is pro-choice and will advocate for federal legislation that would protect a woman’s right to choose. She will also “support and fund initiatives that increase access to family planning, invest more intentionally on critical maternal healthcare initiatives and increase availability of Plan B and emergency contraceptives.”
Perry supports comprehensive immigration reform, is an advocate for environmental justice and aims to pass the Universal Background Check for gun ownership through congress if elected. 
Perry is endorsed by Rep. Maxine Waters, L.A. City Controller Ron Galperin and the Progressive Democratic Club. The complete list of Perry’s supporters can be found in the endorsements section of her campaign website. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Perry stressed the importance of voting in this upcoming election, regardless of where one might be registered. 
“This mid-term election could be one of the most important in our lifetime,” Perry wrote. “Our voting rights, civil rights and a woman’s right to choose are all on the ballot. Young people can have a tremendous impact on the preservation of our republic if they choose to flex their power and vote.” 
Kamlager corroborated Perry’s call to action in her statement to the Daily Trojan, writing, “You deserve to have a say in the decisions that will drastically shape the future for you and me. Voting in this election and each after ensures that your voices are heard.”

On a sunny afternoon last Sunday, the typical hub of tables filled with conversation, studying and long lines for food in the USC Village was complemented by live music and dance performances. 
In anticipation of the annual multi-day holiday that reunites the living with the dead, Día de los Muertos — Day of the Dead — attendees to the Celebración del Día de los Muertos with the Grupo Folklórico partook in traditional, themed festivities. 
Families decorated sugar skulls, symbols of remembrance of departed loved ones that help revive their spirit. Attendees also participated in other Halloween activities, such as children trick-or-treating at retailers and competing in costume contests. The celebration included the greater Los Angeles community, with many families joining USC students in the festivities.
The afternoon began with live music that featured a local group from Miramonte Elementary School. The band, Music Will, shared Halloween tunes, filling the USC Village with song. The performing band consisted of fifth and eighth graders who donned black and white costumes, some even sporting painted skulls on their faces. 
As strumming from the guitars and basses reverberated, Music Will’s energy permeated throughout the outdoor space. Lining the sparkling stage were golden bouquets of marigolds, flowers typically associated with Día de los Muertos celebrations and symbolic of the fragility of life. Strings of marigolds also decorated the aisles of the surrounding arena of filled chairs.
Music Will performed classic songs, such as “My Girl” by The Temptations, to which audience members danced, along with Halloween-themed tunes. 
“When I went to music class, I really liked to play the guitar so I found that as my hobby and started playing it more often,” said Alyssa Sanchez, a fifth grader in the band. 
This performance was not the band’s first for Día de los Muertos.
“[Music] can express how you feel and it has different meanings,” fifth grader Jayelle Andrade said.
As the band serenaded the crowd, younger attendees sat at tables beside the performance stage, painting and enjoying candy collected in cellophane bags and Jack-o’-Lantern trick-or-treat bags of their own. Children also wandered throughout the space wearing elaborate and festive Halloween costumes in eager anticipation of the upcoming costume contests.
After Music Will performed, Grupo Folklórico de USC, a Mexican traditional dance group, took the stage to perform dances from multiple regions of Mexico to honor those who have passed. This performance was their main showcase for the fall semester. 
“Our group, Grupo Folklórico de USC, kind of wanted to celebrate the day in our own way which was through dance,” said Brenda Sampayo, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “I think that the group really did a great way of bringing together a group of people to celebrate that.”
The dancers wore different outfits, each specific to the region of their dance. They also incorporated the makeup looks and decorations into their performance as well. 
“I think it was a really great way to — as part of the Latino community — celebrate the day and connect with that part of my culture,” Sampayo said. 
As the event progressed, the crowd grew larger and seats filled up as passersby joined the audience and engaged in the spirited event. The event was concluded with a performance by USC Mariachi. 
As the student-run mariachi ensemble entered the stage, they created a semicircle facing the audience. Together, their instruments, ranging from string instruments of violins to brass trumpets, gave a voice to the mariachi music. The instrumental performances were followed by singing, as the ensemble clad in matching black outfits provided the musical background encircling the singers.
“I thought it was super nice to be exposed to that music,” said Sanya Verma, a sophomore majoring in computer science, who attended the event. “[The mariachi music] kind of livened up the whole place. It was really lovely how they went up and did it because it’s a very brave thing to do.”

I spend a fair amount of time online, especially since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. It was a safe way to stay connected, informed and entertained. However, I began to notice some disturbing patterns whenever I read a body positive article or watched a YouTube video featuring a plus-size woman. In the comments lurked the inevitable vitriol, as well as some variation of the message: stop promoting an unhealthy lifestyle. Huh?
I always anticipate a certain amount of hatred and disgust in the comments sections of plus-size content creators. Whether it’s online or in real life, people aren’t always kind when it comes to weight. My hope is that I can help dispel a couple of the more common fatphobic myths I see online. I don’t expect bullies who genuinely wish harm on others to gain something from this article. I hope they get the help they need, but this isn’t really for them. This is for the well-intentioned commenters who have been conditioned to see any form of plus-size representation as unhealthy.
Positive plus-size representation online and in the media is extremely new. With the creation of platforms like YouTube and TikTok, plus-size individuals can finally own their narratives and use their voices to share their stories. They can talk about their journey to self-acceptance, or their struggles with weight loss, dieting, disordered eating, finding a prom dress that fits — anything their heart desires. They can focus on the positives or the negatives, or create content that has nothing to do with size. They can show the world that they are as complete and human as everyone else. 
Plus-size representation isn’t just caricatures or demeaning stereotypes anymore. This shift is liberating, but it can be jarring for viewers who are used to seeing plus-size people through the judgmental lens of people who, well, aren’t.
Fatphobic myth #1: Beauty and fatness are mutually exclusive. I can’t count the number of times I’ve read a comment that says, “You’re not fat. You’re beautiful!” This is often meant wholeheartedly as a compliment. However, it’s important to acknowledge the underlying assumption that prompts this type of comment — that you can’t be both fat and beautiful. No characteristic or identity exempts you from looking or feeling beautiful.
Fatphobic myth #2: Body positivity is unhealthy because we should be condemning obesity. I agree with the sentiment that promoting obesity would be irresponsible. However, I fail to see the connection between the principles of body positivity and the promotion of obesity. Body positivity, at its core, is about self-acceptance and self-love. Encouraging people to love the bodies they have is not the same as encouraging people to become obese.
This myth is connected to the pervasive idea that stigmatizing weight is the “cure” for obesity. I mean, if we don’t want people to be obese, doesn’t it make sense to perpetuate weight stigma? I can sort of understand the logic behind this one, but the evidence just doesn’t support it. The Obesity Empower Network reported that the evidence actually suggests the opposite, stating that stigmatization based on weight has a “detrimental impact on the behaviors and wellbeing of people living with obesity.”
Hateful words only lead to a decrease in motivation — whether that is with engaging in physical activity or reaching out for professional and social support. The OEN goes further in stating, “Such experiences might also increase disordered eating for people with overweight or obesity.” 
If you still disagree, let me try to put it another way. If you are friends with a classmate who is struggling in math, how might you support them? Would you reinforce the notion that they must be stupid, and shouldn’t be struggling? Would you tell them that they have less worth until they successfully learn it? Or, would you reassure them that they are more than their math knowledge, give them advice if they ask for it and avoid bringing it up in every interaction? The first technique shames them, while the second uplifts them. Remember: shame is not a successful motivator in either scenario. Work to lift people up, not put them down!
As a disclaimer, this analogy is solely for people who want to appropriately support plus-size individuals in their weight loss journey. It is not about those who offer unsolicited weight loss encouragement to people who have no intention or desire to lose weight. But, most importantly, please stop harassing plus-size people online. 
I was overjoyed to finally see plus-size people on my screen who weren’t portrayed as pitiful, demonized or reduced to a cheap fat joke. It’s disheartening to know that the same creators who have given me so much hope are at the receiving end of constant online harassment. Please keep in mind that even the most well-intentioned comment about someone’s weight or health can still do harm. Before posting a comment, reflect on what you’re saying. And this should apply to everything, not just in regards to a person’s weight. 
I often hear about what people are entitled or allowed to do online: “I’m entitled to my opinion and “He’s allowed to say what he wants.” These statements are true — but to an extent. You are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to inflict them on others and harm them in the process. If your comment might do harm to a content creator’s mental and physical well-being, it’s worth asking yourself whether your right to say what’s on your mind should supersede a person’s ability to exist online without being subjected to destructive weight stigma or bias.

On Saturday, more than 150 people were killed in a stampede during Halloween festivities in Seoul’s Itaewon district. The incident is the nation’s deadliest peacetime disaster in eight years. This column is dedicated to the victims and their families.
Three cheers for Liz Truss, the Iceberg Lady who lost to a lettuce; for the fresh hell that is Iran’s most immoral “moral” government; and for whatever the United States is even doing right now. 
Democracy is at an age where it is of the people and by the people, but certainly not for the people. The “choices” we are given with our leaders are either this lunatic or that lunatic. Despite no one liking them once they’re elected, there is nothing we can do to get rid of them except wait for the next lunatic-versus-lunatic election. Look no further than former President Donald Trump — whose approval rating never passed 50% — and all the times Democrats tried to impeach him for his various (alleged) crime. 
With much of the media now intent on mocking the disaster that is Britain’s Conservative Party — for whom voting intention is at a meager 22% — I would like to divert your attention for a quick moment to the equal, if not worse, calamity that is South Korea. 
As a Korean American, I’ve noticed that Korea is always a little behind on American trends — whether it’s esports, Myers-Briggs personality tests or alt-right pipelines. Trumpism is no different. In 2016, reports that then-president Park Geun-hye disappeared for seven hours during the Sewol ferry disaster — which killed 300 people, including 250 high school students on a field trip — led to nationwide candlelight protests. By the next year, Park was impeached, removed from office and ultimately imprisoned. At this point, Trumpism had already made its way into the Korean far right. Fringe pro-Park counter-protests in 2017 featured American flags right alongside Korean flags — a feature which soon established itself as a hallmark of the Korean right, much as the stars and stripes do today with the American right. 
Enter Yoon Seok-yeol, the conservative who won this year’s presidential election on an anti-woke economic platform. What made Yoon stand out was that he wasn’t the typical politician. He was more than willing to break convention. He didn’t care for it. Any American who was alive in 2016 — when Trump won because he was funny, memeable and didn’t give a shit — will recognize that line of reasoning. And just as it was Trump’s downfall, so too is it now with Yoon’s little regime.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of his administration’s failures.
The instant Yoon took office, he packed his cabinet with former prosecutors, many of whom were his former underlings at the Ministry of Justice. Prosecutors at the ministry are infamously difficult to prosecute (surprise!). Now, with prosecutors installed all over Yoon’s administration, the entire government is shielded from legal accountability. On Oct. 24, reports emerged, with evidence, that Yoon partied with his Minister of Justice and some 30 lawyers from a large law firm at a high-end bar. Yoon has so far vehemently denied the reports, calling them “cheap and childish fake news.” Remind you of anyone?
Yoon’s performance in foreign diplomacy is miserable to say the least. He declined to meet Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi when she visited Korea Aug. 4, saying he was on vacation. He met with President Joe Biden Sept. 21 at a conference for the Global Fund, and spoke with him for a grand total of 48 seconds — after which Yoon was caught on tape insulting Biden and U.S. Congresspersons. As world leaders met in Britain for Elizabeth II’s funeral, Yoon arrived late, attended the reception, refused to wait in line to pay respects to the queen lying in state and left. 
With Korea’s image devastated, its economy destabilized with a weak currency and struggling stock market, and Yoon refusing to take responsibility, his approval rating as of last week stands at 30%, an improvement from 24% last month. Oct. 22 saw yet another candlelight protest, which organizers estimated brought 300,000 people to the streets demanding that Yoon resign. Their calls will likely fall on deaf ears; for now, South Koreans join Brits, Americans and others in patiently waiting to elect the next lunatic into office.

As we are all surely knee-deep in the busiest stretch of the semester, it’s hard not to get caught up in all the stresses of assignments and exams… which means it’s more important than ever to find the time to unwind and recharge. One of the most reliable ways to do that is with great entertainment. From HBO Max to Apple TV+, the streaming gods have given us a plethora of films and shows to look forward to in November. Here are the hottest titles coming to your screen. 
Apple TV+
“Mythic Quest” Season 3 – Nov. 11
The criminally underseen video game comedy returns to Apple TV+ with another 10-episode third season, with a fourth season already on the way! If you’re at all into video games or the entertainment industry… or the comedic mastermind that is Rob McElhenney, then this is the show for you.
“Spirited” – Nov. 18
Ryan Reynolds, Will Ferrell and Octavia Spencer are looking to create a new holiday classic with this modern musical spin on “A Christmas Carol,” told from the perspective of the three ghosts this time, and featuring original music by “La La Land” and ”The Greatest Showman” songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. In the film, Ferrell plays the Ghost of Christmas Present, who in this version of the tale, reexamines his own past, present and future after picking the wrong Scrooge in Ryan Reynolds’ Clint Briggs. Before its streaming release on Nov. 18, the film will have a limited theatrical run on Nov. 11. 
Netflix
“Blockbuster” – Nov. 3
As the great Michael Scott once said, “How the turn tables.” The irony of Netflix making a show about the last Blockbuster store standing is hilarious in itself. This 10-episode comedy, starring Randall Park and penned by Vanessa Ramos of “Superstore” and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” looks to be another fun ensemble workplace sitcom in the making, but this time packed with more movie references and meta-entertainment jokes that only such a setting could provide.
“Enola Holmes 2” – Nov. 4
This sequel to the 2020 breakout film will see Millie Bobby Brown’s fourth-wall breaking detective opening up her agency and entering the workforce as a young woman in late-19th century England (what fun!). The entire cast from the first film returns, including fan favorite Henry Cavill as her brother/other world-famous detective Sherlock Holmes (hopefully in a much bigger role this time).
“The Crown” Season 5 – Nov. 9
The motto of the fifth season of the royal saga is “a house divided,” which can also extend to the public consensus on the series. With the series edging closer and closer to the present day, with this season being set in the 1990s, how the show chooses to cover critical events is becoming a heated point of debate. Netflix, for one, has buckled under pressure to include a disclaimer to the season five trailer after an open letter from Dame Judi Dench criticizing the show for its “crude sensationalism.” It goes without saying that this season will be the most controversial yet, as it will focus on Charles and Diana’s separation and the repercussions on the royal family, as well as Diana’s death, steeped in conspiracy to this day. And, as with every two seasons on this show, they’re switching up the cast again, with Imelda Staunton (Dolores Umbridge herself) now taking on the late Queen, while Elizabeth Debicki and Dominic West will play Diana and Charles. 
“Wednesday” – Nov. 23
Tim Burton takes a crack at the Addams Family with this creepy, kooky, Wednesday-focused series reimagining, starring Jenna Ortega in the title role. Ortega will be joined by Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia, Luis Guzmán as Gomez and Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester. The series will follow Wednesday as she attends Nevermore Academy, a school for “outcasts, freaks, and monsters,” where she will learn to master her psychic powers whilst contending with the horrors of high school. Snap snap.
Disney+
“Zootopia+” – Nov. 9
It’s time to return to the city of Zootopia with these bite-size original shorts encompassing characters new and old from the anthropomorphic city. From “The Real Rodents of Rodentia,” a spin on the “Real Housewives” franchise, to “The Godfather of the Bride,” continuing the Godfather parody from the original film, these should be perfect pick-me-ups between all the studying.
“Disenchanted” – Nov. 18
It’s time to wake up from that 15-year slumber, because here is the long-awaited sequel to “Enchanted,” coming exclusively to Disney+ just in time for Thanksgiving. “Disenchanted” will take place 15 years after the events of the first film and follows Amy Adams’ Giselle as she and her family move from Manhattan into Monroeville, a suburb nefariously overseen by Maya Rudolph’s Malvina Monroe. When problems begin to arise, Giselle wishes for their lives to return to being a perfect fairytale, but when the spell backfires, the fate of her family and homeland of Andalasia fall into jeopardy, and she must save them before the last stroke of midnight. In addition to Adams, the whole cast is back from the first film, from Patrick Dempsey to James Mardsen, and the film will feature a slew of new songs by Disney legend Alan Menken.
HBO Max
“The Sex Lives of College Girls” Season 2 – Nov. 18
The fate of Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble’s hit college series about four freshmen balancing their sexually active lifestyles with the struggles and hardships of college life was very much in question after David Zaslav’s spree of tax-motivated cancellations at Warner Bros. Discovery, mainly targeting HBO Max original projects, earlier this year. But fans of the show can rest at ease because it is officially back with 10 episodes (two episodes weekly), exclusively on HBO Max starting Nov. 18.

Smino might be singing in a falsetto, but he’s speaking truth, and he really wants you to listen. 
After four long years without a full-length project, the St. Louis rapper returned with his third studio album, “Luv 4 Rent,” Oct. 28, and it was worth each bated breath.
The 15-track record is just over 50 minutes of absolute sonic beauty. Each of the rapper’s projects is more expansive than the last, but this album in particular points to a certain longevity that can only be accomplished through consistency and patience. 
Rather than changing up his style and feel with each of his albums, Smino is as an artist who continues to hone in and deepen his own sound with every release and pushes himself beyond bounds of expectation. 
Smino’s voice and unparalleled wordplay alone, which particularly stands out on “Garden Lady,” reasserts the artist as one of the best in the game. 
On the opening song “No L’s,” Smino immediately flexes his lyricism as he sings, “Don’t got what you see, I’m connected like seam / Cards that they dealt made a king out of him.” The rapper’s ability to draw the two lines together with a him/hem homophone showcases his natural bravado to shapeshift words and take ownership of what he’s saying. 
Producer Monte Booker, a longtime fruitful collaborator of the “blkswn” artist, has his hands all over this project yet again. Groove, Kal Banx, Childish Major and others also contribute to one of the most intricate productions we’ve gotten from Smi — nearly every song uses such a collage of samples, chords and vocals, crafted in deliberate, quick succession without becoming overwhelming or muddied.  
What truly sets this project apart, though, is Smino’s value for tempo.
In a time where most radio hits are at least 150 bpm, Smino’s slower and melodic tracks dig their feet into the ground and maintain that they’re right where they need to be. “Louphoria” is one of the most beautiful songs on the album and features Cruza, a three-piece band hailing from Orlando that pushes Smino’s sound in a almost psych-rock direction. 
While Smino continues to reign as one of music’s most infectious voices, he unearths his innermost thoughts, feelings and fears. “Luv 4 Rent” reflects the world that the “Wild Irish Roses” singer has found himself in — one that is still hotboxed with smoke, but is more notably saturated and sustained by love.
On “Pudgy,” he sings one of the best lines on the album: “Reason number one is I’m the son of trees and moons and martyrs, authors.” 
Smino might be providing us with a gospel worthy album, but he doesn’t want to seem as though he is all-knowing. He surrenders himself to the people he has learned from and loved, and lets those intricate relationships shine through each double entendre or detailed metonymy. 
Addressing love in all of its many forms, from familial to intimate relations, this album is an overwhelmingly invasive look into the trials and tribulations of it all, and reminds us to not take it (or Smi) for granted. And yet, the rapper told Complex that his greatest hope is that listeners understand the importance of self-assurance and looking inward. 
“I always had someone else taking care of my shit, or may have been putting my crown in the hands of other motherfuckers. But I can take care of my own crown too,” he said on the eve of his release. 
One line on the opening song, “sometimes, you gotta move when the spirit say so,” captures this organic sensation that is natural only to an artist that is sure of themselves. There is no evidence of rushed artistry on this album; there is rather an effortlessness in its cadence that is only possible when you’re just that good. 
“Luv 4 Rent” is Smino’s home and each of his impressive guests fall into his world of hip-hop, soul and funk in such a way that asserts that the rapper is in control, and everyone is along for the ride with utter respect and grace. His commanding mix of rapping and singing create a soundscape that even the likes of Lil Uzi Vert find themselves shapeshifting to immerse themselves into – and it sounds really good. 
The only time Smino releases the reins of control is on “Pro Freak,” where TDE-signed artist Doechii definitely carries the song with her incredible flow after an underwhelming chorus. 
“Blu Billy” is a track filled with honorable hip-hop sentiments that remind critics that Smino’s just as strong in that sonic realm as he is in the more soulful sounds. Lucky Daye and Phoelix transcend on “Modennaminute” and it’s one of the dreamiest outros on the album. 
“Ole Ass Kendrick” is the song you should be adding to your smoke sesh playlist. Though the rapper’s entire discography is worth that sentiment, this track particularly notes the transformation of rap and hip-hop over recent history. This and the second single, “Matinee,” reflect the epitome of the Smino we have come to know and love, feeling like they’re tracks that fell through the cracks of his 2018 album “NOIR.” 
When considered in its totality, the intro, “4rm Da Source,” and acting closer, “Curtains,” are probably the most notable components of this emotional album. Arguments can definitely be made for the latter to be considered song of the year. 
The bookend tracks show the growth of understanding that the most important “fruit from the source” will always be the love you find within yourself. 
After the beautiful mixing of the outro of “Curtains,” the final track, “Lee & Lovie,” acts as almost an encore, accompanying the end credits as the beloved rapper and Houston singer reggie, rolls off into the setting sun of self-assured love. 
Smino closes this album reminding listeners to put it all on the line. It’s worth it when you do.
To celebrate the release, Smino will be co-headlining a joint tour with Dreamville rapper JID in 2023. The “Luv is 4Ever” Tour will grace Los Angeles at the end of January.

Over Fall break, I watched the latest iteration of the Shakespeare classic “Romeo and Juliet:” “Rosaline.” The live-action film, starring Kaitlyn Dever as the titular character, provides another angle to the “Romeo and Juliet” story, telling the story again through the eyes of Rosaline, Romeo’s ex. 
In this adaptation, many of the events of the original Shakespeare version are the same (would it be “Romeo and Juliet” otherwise?). Romeo (Kyle Allen) and Juliet (Isabela Merced) fall in love at first sight, but they’re from opposing families. In this version, the two must fake their deaths — in a comedic manner, as befits a film in the comedy genre. What the film provides is a new sense of the classic; instead of the original tragedy, the only tragedy here is that once he meets Juliet, Romeo ditches Rosaline without giving her a second thought. 
“Rosaline” has been labeled a “feminist” film by outlets such as Variety, which makes sense given that the whole storyline is Rosaline attempting to win her love back in a patriarchal society where she’s treated like property to be married off. Rosaline strives to be the main character of her own romance, which is an admirable desire: a character motivation that awakens themes of gender inequality. 
In this reimagining, Romeo is ignorant and unintelligent, paling in comparison to Rosaline’s new suitor, Dario (Sean Teale), who assists Rosaline on her journey. Dario is Rosaline’s love interest, but he’s not one of the focuses of the tale, the way Romeo was in Juliet’s. The title of the film is “Rosaline,” not “Rosaline and Dario.”
While I have some qualms about the way the whole concept of “Rosaline” is executed — mostly that everything happens too quickly — I still appreciate the way the film is able to provide yet another new angle by which to view “Romeo and Juliet.” The humor in this reimagining is palpable, especially in poking fun at the characters’ shortcomings and straying away from the centering of the two “main” characters. 
Reimaginings don’t necessarily have to tell the story from a whole new character’s point of view to have merit, though. It can just be from a new perspective. One example I think about is “Gnomeo and Juliet,” the 2011 animated film directed by Kelly Asbury. 
In “Gnomeo and Juliet,” Romeo, renamed Gnomeo, reflects on the fact that both he and Juliet are garden gnomes. Voiced by James McAvoy and Emily Blunt, respectively, Gnomeo and Juliet are star-crossed gnome lovers, each living in yards on different sides of the fence. The gnomes’ relationships mirror the enmity of their human neighbors, Mr. Capulet (Richard Wilson) and Mrs. Montague (Julie Walters) — Juliet is part of the red-hat gnomes on Mr. Capulet’s side, while Gnomeo is part of the blue-hat gnomes on Mrs. Montague’s side.
Other than the transplantation of Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet” into the lives of modern-day garden gnomes, “Gnomeo and Juliet” is uniquely suited for the animated medium due to its use of everyday objects. The original Shakespeare tale is set in Verona, Italy, during the Renaissance period, which is a beautiful location but might feel inaccessible to viewers. Having the tale set in everyday backyards makes it more fun. The story is also perhaps more engaging because audiences may be more familiar with the tale’s setting and objects, especially since we may wonder what our inanimate objects are doing when we’re not there. 
Shakespeare’s statue even comes to life and speaks to Gnomeo in the film about the parallels between Gnomeo’s story and his play of “Romeo and Juliet,” which I suppose is a very meta moment that pays homage to the source material. All in all, “Gnomeo and Juliet” is a memorable work because it makes full use of animation’s freedoms and artistic capabilities to reinvent the original Shakespeare tale.
Similar to “Rosaline,” “Gnomeo and Juliet” translates what was originally a tragic tale into a comedy. The difference is that while the former is live-action, the latter is an animated film. I think, though, that both have a lot in common with one another in the fact that they draw reference material from Shakespeare and use that inspiration for the details of their own stories. 
If reading Shakespeare was difficult for you just like it was for me in high school, maybe try one of these films. They’re digestible, innovative in a modern sense and, I know for me personally, distract me from the often “tragic” happenings of my own life.

It read like movie credits an hour before USC’s road game against Arizona. 
First, it was sophomore linebacker Eric Gentry shown as not dressed during warmups. Then, it was redshirt senior offensive lineman Andrew Vorhees not warming up. Moments later, senior linebacker Ralen Goforth and sophomore rush Korey Foreman were ruled out. And, as expected, Biletnikoff Award-winning junior wide receiver Jordan Addison wasn’t suited up to play.  
Within a matter of 20 minutes, the Trojans were bit terribly by an injury bug. It didn’t stop there though, with sophomore wide receiver Mario Wiliams beginning the game on the sideline and never entering due to an injury. 
OK, so USC lost, right? All these injuries surely caught up to them. Arizona’s wildly efficient offense was just too much for the Trojans’ injury ridden defense. Without his top two receivers, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams’ Heisman hopes took another wrong turn.  
Nope. Not this team, not this quarterback and not this program. 
“I’m as proud of this win as any of the seven this year without a doubt,” said Head Coach Lincoln Riley after the game.
Yup, he should be. 
USC fought and fought and fought so hard, Traveler was prancing back in L.A. It wasn’t a victory as gritty as the one against Oregon State, but, taking into account the injuries and opponent, it’s right up there. 
The Wildcats are no slobs. Prior to last Saturday’s matchup, they were ranked in the conference’s top five in yards per game and put up 543 against USC (yes, we’ll talk about that defense, don’t you worry).
When Arizona made it a two-point game late in the third quarter, the Trojans didn’t fold, extending their lead to 16 and securing the win. The defense came alive late, forcing a punt and then having the Wildcats earn their final touchdown of the game.
But, wow, that man Caleb Williams is a magician. 
Since that poor game against Oregon State on the road, Williams has thrown 15 touchdowns and one interception, including a massive five-touchdown performance against Utah in Salt Lake City. He’s cool, he’s calm, he’s… You know the rest. 
Dare I say, a Heisman game is incoming against UCLA in three weeks? 
That could happen, especially if the receiving corps plays like it did today. No Addison, no Mario, no problem. 
Two receivers, redshirt juniors Kyle Ford and Tahj Washington, each had over 100 yards receiving. After not scoring once the entire season, Ford and Washington secured at least one each. A whopping 10 receivers caught passes for the USC. 
Can any defense left on the Trojans’ schedule stop this offense?
University of California, Berkeley can’t. We don’t need to explain why Colorado, allowing the most yards and points per game in the Pac-12, doesn’t stand a chance. Get those two out of the way.
That sets up two key final matchups to end the regular season. 
Oregon embarrassed UCLA’s leaky defense two weeks ago in Eugene. Notre Dame poses a legit threat, but USC at home is averaging 45 points per game and who knows how the Fighting Irish will be by the time that game comes around. 
And while some Trojan fans may point to the defense as a concern, I’ll admit, it was a problem. Arizona put up 39 points, its second-highest total of the season, plus 543 yards, the second most USC has allowed this season — only the Utes had more against the Trojans. 
Numbers wise, it’s alarming — actually, no, let me take that back. It’s unacceptable. Can you imagine what the Bruins might do to this defense? 
But, context is important. USC was without its first two linebackers on the depth chart. An already thin rush group lost another body. Defensive coordinator Alex Grinch had to lean on players with limited playing time so far. 
Just like Shaq at the free throw line though, when it mattered most, the Trojans’ defense came to play and USC is still rolling.  
With four games left, all of which are in Southern California, this Trojan season is set for a Hollywood ending. Prepare to roll the credits.

On a sunny Los Angeles Sunday, USC wasted no time in opening the scoring against Washington State, but their hot start did not last. 
In the 4th minute, junior midfielder Zoe Burns made a darting run unmarked into the Washington State 18-yard box. Spotting her teammate, senior left back Jaelyn Eisenhart slid a pass to Burns, who took a touch to settle then hit the ball with her left. The shot curved away from Washington State goalkeeper Nadia Cooper and hit the right post, bouncing into the net.
After Burns’ goal, Washington State settled into the match and began to create opportunities of their own. The Cougars’ direct, physical style led to a few successful counterattacks, using forward Margie Detrizio as an outlet for long balls forward. A loose ball fell to Detrizio’s feet from a corner kick in the 23rd minute and she scored, tying the match at 1-1.
USC came flying out the halftime break, but the Cougars shocked the Trojans once again. Detrizio carried the ball into a shooting position and unleashed a powerful effort towards graduate goalkeeper Anna Smith, who saved the ball low to her left. The ball deflected back to Detrizio, who did not waste her second chance. She lifted the ball over Smith for Washington State’s second goal. 
For the next four minutes, it seemed like it just wasn’t USC’s day. The Trojans peppered Cooper with shots, but two second-chance strikes at the other end meant that Washington State had taken the lead, 1-2. 
It didn’t take long for USC to regain their mojo. Sophomore midfielder Helena Sampaio stood over a free kick, not far outside the box. She struck the ball low and around the wall. The ball collided with Cooper and it bounced off her just back into play. The ball found the feet of junior forward Angeles Escobar, who tapped it in to tie the score with her first goal of the season.
After the equalizing goal, USC’s play had acquired a new energy. The Trojans played crisper forward passes, linking play smoothly. Sophomore forward Simone Jackson and sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer charged up the field with confidence, carrying the ball forward and troubling Washington State defenders with their ball control. 
For a brief moment, Washington State threatened again, pushing the ball into USC’s half and winning a corner kick. Smith snatched the ball cleanly out of the air from another Washington State cross, then punted the ball upfield to Jackson. With the ball at her feet, Jackson turned around her defender at the sideline and surged forward into the box. Unmarked, Jackson struck the ball into the left side netting with her left foot for her sixth goal of the season. 
With the lead reestablished and heaps of positive momentum, USC established control over the match and never looked back. Washington State tried to break through with their kick-and-rush style, sending long balls forward to challenge USC’s backline, but the Trojans’ defenders held their ground and ensured that the remaining 25 minutes of the second half were relatively calm.
Around the 83rd minute, Washington State’s frustration at losing the lead became evident. Jackson dribbled up the left touchline. She looked unhurried, taking as much time as possible off the clock. Realizing Jackson wanted to get to the corner, Washington State defender Sydney Studer tackled Jackson hard, eliciting loud protests from the home crowd. Under pressure from the crowd, the referee didn’t award a yellow crowd, despite Jackson staying on the ground in pain. 
Washington State attempted to piece together a shot in the final minute, but USC maintained their composure and the whistle blew to end the match. 
After the match, Head Coach Jane Alukonis commended the team for fighting hard against the Cougars.
“Washington State is a really hard team to play against,” Alukonis said. She expected the Cougars to play in a direct, long-ball style and emphasized the importance of winning 50-50 balls immediately at the backline and in defensive midfield areas.“We focused recently on using the width and also following everything because we know [Washington State’s] a team that gives up second-phase balls sometimes. Angie’s [Escobar] goal was off one of those plays.”
With the win against Washington State, USC improves their record to 7-1-2, sitting on 23 points in the Pac-12 standings.
Burns, the opening goalscorer, had plenty of praise for her teammates after the match. 
“I thought everyone was killing it,” Burns said. “Aaliyah [Farmer] was getting to every single ball in the air, Helena [Sampaio] was fighting all the time and giving great services, all of our subs that came in were impactful and amazing.” 
After UCLA’s 3-0 win against Washington on Sunday, USC cannot finish higher than third in the Pac-12, even with a win against UCLA in their final regular season match. More importantly, though, a positive result against the Bruins would help secure USC a high seed for the NCAA Women’s College Cup Round of 32.
According to Burns, UCLA will pose a different stylistic challenge to the team, one that the group is looking forward to.
“[UCLA will be] the opposite kind of opponent [in terms of] style of play as WSU, so it’s going to be a completely different approach for us mindset-wise, but I think we’re really excited because I think UCLA matches more what we like to do and how we like to play… [we’ve] been ready for that one,” Burns said.
USC will play UCLA Friday at 2 p.m. at Soni McAlister Field.
