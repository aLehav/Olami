Civil rights activist Sylvia Mendez spoke at Taper Hall Monday evening about her family’s landmark Mendez v. Westminster case, which ended segregation in California in 1946.
As a young girl who grew up in Orange County, Mendez was forced to attend a school specifically for students of Mexican descent. After much dispute between her parents and the school, Mendez’s parents, Gonzalo and Felicitas Mendez, fought segregation by hiring a lawyer using income from the family’s agricultural business.
According to Mendez,  Judge Paul J. McCormick ruled in favor of Mendez, which marked a defeat to the school districts in Orange County.
Mendez v. Westminster preceded Brown v. Board of Education and challenged racial segregation; it no doubt helped California become the first state to have integrated schools. For her continued efforts to combat racism, Mendez was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest citizen civilian award, by President Barack Obama in 2011.
“An Evening with Sylvia Mendez” was put together by the Political Student Assembly, EdMonth and the Latino Student Assembly. At the talk, Mendez played the Emmy-winning documentary Mendez v. Westminster: For all the Children/Para Todos los Niños to thoroughly explain her family’s efforts and then took questions afterward.
Mendez noted that we still see separation in schools today.
“We are more segregated now than we were in 1975,” Mendez said. “The two schools that are named after my mother and father … are 100 percent Latino … We can’t move out of a district. We can go to any school, but if we can’t move out of a district … we stay in that district and we’re segregated. They put the schools right in the middle of the barrio so all the Latinos go to that school.”
Director of Student Political Assembly Edwin Saucedo said we can’t see past efforts to desegregate communities as much as we should be able to.
“Even though we no longer get segregated based on the color of our skin, the communities that we build are very much segregated and they’re not as integrated as our ancestors have fought them to be,” Saucedo said.
If students stand up for change, others will be willing to help according to Mendez.
“When you find something you want to work for, you will see that everyone will want to join in for justice,” Mendez said. “People will rally. They’ll come and help you if you find an injustice and you stand up and fight.”
Mendez said students need to pave the way for equality.
“You students have a lot to work for,” Mendez said. “You have a struggle that’s ahead of you and you’re the ones that will have to find a solution.”
Saucedo said Mendez made him better recognize past efforts for equality.
“It kind of puts into perspective that the people that came before us really fought for us to be here and that’s something that we always need to keep in mind,” Saucedo said. “Going forward, we need to fight for other people to continue to have great opportunities.”
Stephanie Flores, a junior majoring in psychology, said spreading awareness is key to equality.
“Moving towards equality really starts within us and that’s just something that not everybody has caught on to sadly,” Flores said. “I think continuing to push and do what she does … is what creates the change. That’s where people find the will inside of them to move forward.”

Undergraduate Student Government has submitted a proposal to USC administration in hopes of improving on-campus accessibility for students with disabilities.
A task force comprised of USG members and the student body at large identified a series of concerns regarding current infrastructure for students with disabilities. The group then consolidated these suggestions into a proposal, which was sent to President C. L. Max Nikias, Vice Provost of Student Affairs Dr. Ainsley Carry and Assistant Provosts for Student Affairs Dr. Monique Allard and Dr. Lynette Merriman.
“Just having student input is a success in itself … We need to keep moving and keep identifying spaces on campus that need to be reformed so that the Trojan experience can be as comfortable as it can be for all members,” said Rini Sampath, USG president-elect and current vice president, who led the proposal efforts.
In addition to Sampath, the proposal was authored by USG Diversity Affairs delegates Rhea LaFleur, Ariana Aboulafia and Andy Su, as well as Jordan Fowler, student body vice president-elect.
“I am really happy that [Nikias] was so receptive to hearing the proposal himself and also that he acknowledges that disability access is a campus-wide issue,” Sampath said.
Last semester, Sampath began to assemble a task force after meeting with freshman Zack Wentz at a Delta Omicron Zeta meeting.
Sampath, along with the USG Diversity Affairs delegates reached out to different campus stakeholders, such as Housing and the Office of Disability Services and Programs, as well as the student body to consolidate different concerns related to accessibility.
The group was able to make a number of recommendations to the University with the help of Dr. Eddie Roth, director of Disability Services & Programs. Roth helped identify which recommendations would be feasible and which ones would not. Roth suggested that USC hire universal design architects. According to the assembled disability task force, USC currently employs architects who adhere to the minimum requirements of the American Disabiliites Act.
While ADA serves as a nationwide standard, Sampath said USC has not done enough to support students with disabilities on campus. For example, students in wheelchairs have trouble accessing the new Wallis Annenberg Hall because the building does not have a wheelchair accessibility button at each door. For buildings where accessibility buttons are available, the buttons are only located on one side of the building.
“It is vital that architects keep students with disability in mind when constructing the building so that we don’t run into these problems. Although the building is beautiful, it is not functional for all students,” Sampath said.
Academic buildings identified by the task forces as being inaccessible to students with disabilities included the University Religious Center, Raubenheimer Music Faculty Building, Leventhal School of Accounting and the College Academic Services Building. Housing buildings included Regal Trojan, Century Apartments, Parkside Apartments, International Residential College at Parkside and New North Residential College.
The task forces also identified that the Disability Office lacks confidential conversation spaces for students to meet with staff members.
Additionally, students with chronic illness such as Crohn’s disease expressed desire for a  policy protects them from being unfairly penalized by their professors.
USG is now waiting to hear back from the administration, then follow up and arrange another meeting
“A lot of time, people think of diversity as just different races, but there is also physical diversity and diversity in ability. Some people are not as physically able as other people, and others are not as mentally able as other people,” said USG Diversity Affairs delegate Andy Su. “Being able to put this proposal out there and let the administration know that this is a priority for students … When they are making decisions, like building the new University Village, it is critical that they think about all students.”

Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke to USC students about creating a greater sense of environmental awareness on campus at Bovard Auditorium on Monday.
The event titled, “An Evening with the Governator: Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Environment,” stressed the necessity for an environmental crusade to halt the progression of global climate change. At the event, Schwarzenegger promoted the creation of tangible generational change in order to prevent an environmental catastrophe in the future.
The event was hosted by the Environmental Student Assembly and the Speakers Committee. Moderators for the discussion included Bonnie Reiss, global director of the Schwarzenegger Institute, and Terry Tamminen, former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency.
Schwarzenegger has served two terms as the 38th governor of California and currently serves as the chairman for the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy. During the latter half of his term as governor, Schwarzenegger focused on environmental sustainability and global warming. In 2006, he introduced and signed the first national initiative to cap greenhouse gas emissions. That same year, he also implemented the Global Warming Solutions Act in California, which mandated large utilities and business corporations from creating long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state greenhouse gas emission standards.
In 2009, Schwarzenegger created an initiative that enforced automakers to regulate greenhouse emissions from automobile vehicles. Since his appointment as governor in 2003, he has worked to label California as a leader in environmental and climate sustainability.
Reiss said that Schwarzenegger is eager to build and  prioritize USC student connections.
“One of the reasons Schwarzenegger even came to USC is because of his [sic] connection to the great students here,” Reiss told the Daily Trojan. “Anytime we hold a symposium, summit or convening, he always made sure that whichever leaders we bring to campus, that our seats were more open to USC students.”
Shawn Rhoads, executive director of ESA, opened the discussion by explaining that ESA works to provide students with stimulating programs by introducing leaders who promote environmental sustainability.
Schwarzenegger opened the event by explaining his previous success in fitness and entertainment. He made connections between fitness and his decision to create an environmental crusade by making legislative change to promote the importance of protecting the environment by contributing in various ways, such as using eco-friendly light bulbs.
“Climate change is an enormous weight that we must lift off of our world. We can lift it, but we must do it together. Together we can do it, together no challenge and no dilemma is too much,” Schwarzenegger said.
Throughout the discussion, Schwarzenegger argued for the implementation of a successful environmental initiative to fight against climate change. He said the future of energy at a global level is found in renewables and named climate change, health, jobs, security and foreign oil dependency as leading issues within the state of California.
“You have the energy … you are young and you can absorb this [information],” Schwarzenegger said. “This is not a dilemma for future generations, it is our challenge.”
Schwarzenegger also explained how the issue of global climate change and the potency of greenhouse gas emissions has been heavily underestimated among legislators within the public policy sector. He also alluded to the challenges of partisan gridlock on the issue in Congress by explaining his difficulties while trying to pass legislation regulating greenhouse emissions.
“When I became governor of California, I promised to continue California’s generation by helping the environment and pumping the environment,” he said.
Schwarzenegger also framed California as one of the largest leader’s in environmentally friendly practices throughout the nation. He said that California’s economy has grown by a 3.6 percent within the last year and how this growth is attributed to the creation of more “green” jobs.
“We ushered in a new California gold rush by creating green jobs,” Schwarzenegger said.
He also told the audience that every individual should take part in protecting the environment.
“We all breathe the same air, we all drink the same water … it is extremely important to take politics out of this and do what is best for the environment,” Schwarzenegger said.
Reiss then asked how Schwarzenegger worked through issues of gridlock.
“Federal government has fell short when it comes to environmental issues … we should not wait for the federal government or Washington to make up their mind and we should not wait for a global agreement,” Schwarzenegger said.
Schwarzenegger then cited R20 Regions of Climate Change, his nonprofit organization that serves at the sub-national level to promote low-carbon and climate-resilient projects. He said that through the guidance of Terry Taminen, author of Lives of Per Gallon: The True Cost of Our Oil Addiction and Cracking the Code: The Key to Sustainable Profits in the New Economy, he was able to understand key environmental issues.
Schwarzenegger and Taminen both agreed that though many try to vilify the government, local policy matters in paving the way for tangible environmental change.
“Even though the institute is focused on many policy areas because basically the institute is a way for Arnold to continue work on the many policy initiatives he did during his two terms as governor, clearly focusing on environmental and climate is something he is passionate about for one, and California has been a national leader in for decades and decades,” Reiss told the Daily Trojan.

Neither the nation’s top goalie in saves-per-game nor a near two-week break between games were enough to cool off a surging USC women’s lacrosse team on Monday at McAlister Field. Playing their second of five consecutive matches at home, the Women of Troy leapt to a 12-3 halftime advantage over the visiting Lady Flames from Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, en route to a dominant 20-6 victory.
USC came out of the gate firing, outshooting Liberty, 24-6, in the first half. The relentless offensive barrage was led by sophomore attacker Michaela Michael — who scored four first-half goals — and junior midfielder Amanda Johansen, who scored a hat trick of her own. The pair also combined for six of USC’s 10 draw controls in the opening half, equaling that of Liberty’s entire team output during the same timeframe.
“We were really ready for the zone Liberty brought against us today,” Michael said. “We moved the ball really well and either had a lot of shooting space or were able to draw fouls. Personally, I was lucky to get a few eight-meters that I was able to put home.”
The game was the first since       Feb. 24 for USC, who took advantage of the break in action to implement some new offensive sets, as well as prepare for the intensity of their upcoming games. If Monday’s outcome was any indication, the Women of Troy are fast learners and hard workers.
“Today’s performance was really a testament to how hard we’ve worked over the last couple weeks,” head coach Lindsay Munday said. “We asked a lot of the girls, whether it be physically or in learning some new sets and schemes. As coaches we held the girls throughout every practice to the standard that we want to play at, so I’m really proud of the way we came out strong today and performed.”
Perhaps even more impressive than the Women of Troy’s offense, however, was their airtight defense against a Liberty squad that entered Monday’s game boasting two attackers with 14 goals each in Sam Struss and Katy Pridemore. The two talented Liberty scorers were shut out in the first half and managed just one goal apiece on the game.
“We get great scouting reports from our coaches and so we know how the opposing team’s players want to play, and what moves they have,” Johansen said. “We have great defenders on this team and so when you couple that with our great preparation, we are going to be able to match up well with the other team.”
In particular, the first-half defensive effort stood out for USC, as the team dominated possession via 12 caused turnovers and won nearly every hustle statistic, including draw controls (10-6) and ground balls   (17-9). Sophomore attacker/midfielder Gabby McMahon was instrumental in this effort, snagging five ground balls and forcing three turnovers alone in the half.
The second period saw a brief slowing of the scoring, as the teams traded just a pair of goals each in the first 12 minutes. Over the final 18 minutes, however, USC closed on a 6-1 run en route to the 20-6 final. The Women of Troy saw 11 different players put home goals, a testament to the team’s depth.
“Having a big team like we do gives us so many options                 depth-wise,” Johansen said. “In games like today when we are able to get everyone in, we are really able to learn how to play with one another and mesh on the field.”
Munday echoed her player’s sentiments.
“It’s great to have so much depth, as it really raises our competition level,” she said. “As coaches, we are always looking, always evaluating, and we want practice to be as hard as possible so that games almost feel easy for us. We have a number of people that are threats which makes scouting us more difficult.”
Though the scoring might have slowed slightly to start the second half, the pace and physicality of the play most certainly did not. The game saw 53 fouls called, with girls hitting the field throughout. The intense physical play did not faze the Women of Troy, however. In fact, it was embraced, if not by design.
“If the refs allow that physicality, we definitely welcome it,” Johansen said. “I don’t think it bothers us at all. If anything, I think it gets us fired up.”
“We are definitely trying to be as aggressive as we can and remain in charge of the game,” Munday said. “That’s something that we have moved towards over the three years of being a program here. Now that we are older, faster and stronger, it has really helped us ramp up our physicality while still being able to play without fouling or giving up too many eight-meters.”
Monday’s big win kicks off a three-game week for the Women of Troy, who will be spending a majority of their spring break at McAlister Field.
On Friday, the team takes on California in its second conference matchup of the season before hosting Marquette on Sunday. A conference bout with Saint Mary’s on March 20 will wrap up the extended five-game homestand for the team that began with a 17-6 victory over Fresno State on Feb. 24. That game followed a Feb. 21-22 trip to New York to play two tough opponents in Stony Brook (L, 7-4) and Marist (W, 11-7).
Now winners of the three consecutive games, the Women of Troy look to carry their success into Friday’s matchup, which will kick off at 4 p.m.
“We’ve worked really hard for these last two weeks,” Michael said. “We have three games this week, and we are really excited to start this stretch so strong with a big win. It is always great to play at home, and we are planning on keeping the momentum going into Friday.”

Since March 8 was the United Nations’ International Women’s Day, I would like to dedicate this week’s column to all of the women in sports, both collegiate and professional. According to the United Nations website, “International Women’s Day is a time to reflect on progress made, to call for change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities.”
Though women’s sports have certainly come a long way, they are far from equal with men’s sports in scale or popularity. Title IX of the Education Act opened collegiate athletics to women and girls and has vastly increased the number of female collegiate athletes. Statistics show, however, that colleges still favor men’s sports more than women’s.
Male college athletes receive 36 percent more scholarship dollars than female college athletes at NCAA institutions. Men’s college athletics receive more money than women’s in scholarships, recruiting, head coach salaries, and operating expenses. Men have substantially more employment opportunities than women in college sports. Women are 16.9 percent of the athletic directors, 44 percent of the head coaches of women’s teams, 2 percent of the head coaches of men’s teams, and 27.8 percent of the full-time athletic trainers.
Despite this imbalance, women in sports have certainly given us many reasons for celebration. Because the sports industry is such a male-dominated one, honoring the successful women in sports is important to grow athletics for women.
Mixed martial arts (MMA) is one of the most “macho” and male-dominated sports in the world. Recently, though, it is a female who has stolen the MMA spotlight. Ronda Rousey’s most recent win came in just 14 seconds when she forced a tap out. Rousey has said that she feels confident that she could beat a male in her weight class. Don’t expect to see her fight a man, though, as Rousey says she’ll never condone a man hitting a woman in any setting.
WNBA star Brittney Griner had a historic career at Baylor and has extended that success into the WNBA. Aside from her success on the court, Griner is an openly gay female athlete who is a symbol or acceptance and equality.
Danica Patrick, though she has won just one NASCAR race in her career, is the only female to have done so. Her presence alone is a huge accomplishment for women in sports. Because Patrick is such a polarizing personality, it is easy to forget how influential she is.
A list of the most influential female athletes is not complete without Serena Williams, of course. Williams has won not only Grand Slam titles, but Olympic gold medals as well. While America’s men’s tennis players have struggled to bring home Grand Slam titles in the past decade, Williams has dominated the sport.
Not only do males certainly make up a greater percentage of athletes, they also make dominate the managerial positions as well.
While she is well-known for being the National Security Advisor to former President George W. Bush, and later being promoted to secretary of state in the administration’s second term, Condoleezza Rice has made major strides for women in the sport’s industry as well. Rice was chosen to the College Football Playoff selection committee. She has often talked about her love for football and has combated critics who say she has a lack of on-field experience and should be excluded from the committee. She is also one of the first two female members of Augusta National Golf Club, the host site of the Masters.
Hannah Storm is my favorite female sports broadcaster, as she is one of the most prominent faces on ESPN and does a variety of jobs for the network.
Though ESPN has been around since 1979, ESPNW was founded in 2010 to publicize women’s sports. Laura Gentile is the vice president of ESPNW and actively works to represent women’s sports without perpetuating the “pink” and “dumbed down” stereotype of women in sports.
Though I hope to one day achieve the success of these aforementioned women in the sports and sports media industries, I am inspired every day by my fellow Women of Troy. In my short time as sports editor, I have been lucky enough to cover some amazing female athletes here at USC.
Most recently, senior Haley Ishimatsu became the first Pac-12 woman to win the platform dive title three consecutive years. She is just the second woman to win the event three times in a career. For maintaining the delicate balance between academics and athletics, Ishimatsu was named the 2015 Pac-12 Women’s Swimming and Diving Scholar Athlete of the Year.
Senior Elizabeth Eddy is dominant in not only one sport but two. Eddy was named the MPSF Defensive Player of the Week for the week of Feb. 9 as defender on the women’s lacrosse team. With the honor, Eddy became the first USC female student-athlete to win conference player of the week honors in two different sports. Eddy is a forward/midfielder on the women’s soccer team and was recognized with the Pac-12 Women’s Soccer Player of the Week for the week of Aug. 26, 2013.
These are just two of the phenomenal Women of Troy I have had the privilege of covering, and I look forward to covering many more inspiring female athletes at USC.
“Women in sports deserve credit”
yes, they certainly do…  however they do not deserve credit where it is not due…  you state:  “Danica Patrick, though she has won just one NASCAR race in her career, is the only female to have done so.”  that is  false…  she has not won a nascar race at any level…  her only professional first place finish is in indy car almost 7 years ago (april 2008) at motegi japan…
perhaps you meant she is the only woman to win a pole at the daytona 500 (the best of just 3 women who have attempted that feat)???  
the myth of danica patrick is perpetuated when accomplishments she has not reached are attributed to her…  while on one hand “Women in sports deserve credit” they don’t deserve recognition where none is warranted based on inaccurate and lazy reporting…

Ending the team’s longest losing streak of the season, the men’s volleyball team got back to its winning ways last week against UC San Diego. The Trojans (10-5, 9-5 MPSF) take on Penn State today and look to start a winning streak.
On March 4, the Trojans took down UC San Diego (1-14, 0-11) in three sets. The Trojans won by a score of 25-19, 25-13, 25-16. Junior opposite Josh Kirchner, in his return from a two-game absence because of an ankle injury, led the team in kills with 11. Kirchner also led the match with five blocks. Senior middle blocker Robert Feathers added nine kills, and senior setter Micah Christenson had three aces along with five digs.
The Trojans’ hitting percentage for the night was .427 compared to UCSD’s hitting percentage of .072. The Trojans also had six total aces while the Tritons only had one.
While the Trojans took care of business against the Tritons, the last-place team in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference, the Trojans had much more trouble with the rest of the MPSF the last two weeks.
After starting the season 7-0 and 6-0 in MPSF play, the Trojans best overall start to a season since 1991, the team started to hit some bumps in the road. USC dropped its first match of the season at Hawai’i and rebounded with wins against Hawai’i and BYU, but then began the four-match losing streak.
After beating BYU in the first match of two matches at home, the Trojans fell to the Cougars in four sets. The Trojans then suffered surprise losses at UC Santa Barbara then and UCLA. The Trojans fell in straight sets to the Gauchos then lost in four sets to the crosstown rival Bruins. In addition to Kirchner’s absence due to an ankle injury, Christenson had to sit out against UCLA due to an acute sinus infection.
The Trojans returned home on March 3, to host UC Irvine. The Trojans had previously taken down the Anteaters at UC Irvine this season in five sets, but the Anteaters would return the favor at the Galen Center. The Trojans took the first two sets against UC Irvine, but the Anteaters would take the next three and ultimately win the five-set match. The final score was 20-25, 18-25, 25-19, 25-17, 15-13.
Head coach Bill Ferguson gave a lot of credit to the Anteaters, specifically UC Irvine’s opposite Zack La Cavera, but said the Trojans did seem to fade down the stretch.
“They did a better job passing the ball,” Ferguson said. “We were putting a ton of pressure on them early from the service line. I don’t know if they got better or if we were just less than ourselves from the line as the match went on, but there were parts of that game where we were playing great volleyball. We just couldn’t do it long enough.”
The loss marked the second time this season the Trojans had lost in five sets, the previous one being the Trojans’ first loss of the season at Hawai’i. In both        five-set losses, the Trojans won the first two sets but could not close out in the final three.
Coming into this week, the Trojans sit in fifth place in the MPSF standings. Ahead of the Trojans are UC Irvine, Hawai’i, BYU and Pepperdine. The Trojans have split with UC Irvine, Hawai’i and BYU this season. Five of the Trojans’ six matches against the top three teams have gone to the maximum five sets, the lone exception being the Trojans’  four-set loss to BYU. The Trojans also took down Pepperdine in four sets at home earlier this year.
While Ferguson said the losing streak was certainly a rough patch for the team, he believes the toughest part of the schedule is now behind the Trojans. With the exception of one remaining trip to Pepperdine later in March, all of the Trojans’ remaining eight MPSF matches are against teams below the Trojans in the conference standings.
“We have one match against Pepperdine and that’s it with the top five teams in the league,” he said. “We’re done with everybody, and none of those other teams have played each other yet. In the grand scheme of things, we’re okay.”
The Trojans need to finish in the top eight of the 12-team conference to qualify for the MPSF tournament and compete for the conference’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Ferguson said if the team can avenge losses against UC Santa Barbara and UCLA down the road, the team should be in a good spot at the end of the season.
“We need to hold serve and take care of business at home against UCLA and UC Santa Barbara,” he said.
Before resuming the battle through the MPSF, however, the Trojans will have two                         non-conference matches this week. After the Nittany Lions (6-9, 4-0) visit USC today, the Trojans will host Lindenwood  (5-6, 2-5) on Thursday.
The Nittany Lions hail from the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association while Lindenwood represents the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. Penn State qualified for the NCAA tournament last year as the EIVA conference champions, while Lindenwood did not make the tournament.
The Trojans take on Penn State at the Galen Center tonight at 7:30 p.m.
Another dazzling performance vs. a sub .500 team Penn St. Losing is one thing, getting swept easily is another especially at home. Coach Ferguson needs to resign at season end. He has lost this team mentally, and overall recruiting has been sub standard the last three years.

No. 25 USC looks to continue its winning streak this week against UC Irvine and later Washington State after going 3-0 this past weekend at the Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic.
The Trojans managed to come away with tough wins against skilled and well-coached teams, defeating No. 6 Texas Christian University 7-6, No. 1 Vanderbilt 6-5 and rival No. 6 UCLA 8-4.
Head coach Dan Hubbs attributes the Trojans’ stellar weekend to the team’s growing confidence and ability to perform at important moments.
“I thought that we were really resilient in that we were able to score after the other team scored and were pretty relentless, taking great at-bats and coming up with big clutch hits and executing our game plan,” Hubbs said. “I thought all nine guys in the lineup did well and we had some big moments off the bench. I was real proud of the way they played. I thought they were fantastic.”
USC currently holds a 15-1 record, a significant improvement over the team’s record at this point during last season, 8-6. This season has so far shown the Trojans’ maturity as a team and thirst to win each game.
Hubbs agrees with this notion.
“I think the team has really come into their own this year because of more at-bats and more innings pitched, so I think there’s a bigger confidence from them,” Hubbs said.  “A year ago, they were coming off a 20-win season as freshmen, and then last year the second half of the team we played very [well] and the team started to believe that [they were] good.”
“I think the difference between this season and last is that there’s a common belief among the 35 guys in the locker room that every time we go out there we have a chance to win the game no matter who or where we play,” Hubbs said. “It’s been a lot of confidence and maturity all rolled into one and that’s put us in the position that we’re in today.”
Tonight, the Trojans will travel to Anteater Ballpark to take on the UC Irvine Anteaters. UCI is lead by head coach Mike Gillespie, a former Trojan                                       left-fielder during the 1961 national championship and 2014 National Coach of the Year.
UCI currently maintains a 5-9 overall record and a 2-2 home record. The team is highlighted by freshman infielder Parker Coss and junior infielder Mikey Duarte. The team currently holds a .279 team batting average as well as a 5.57 team ERA. The Anteaters will enter tonight’s game coming off a 2-1 series victory over University of Texas, San Antonio.
As for USC, the Trojans currently hold a 15-1 overall record and a 2-1 record on the road. Senior catcher Garrett Stubbs has continued to dominate for the Trojans with a .443 batting average while other Trojans such as Dante Flores, Bobby Stahel, David Oppenheim, Blake Lacey and Angelo La Bruna have managed to hit above .308 thus far. The Trojans currently hold a .311 team batting average as well as a 2.07 team ERA.
Despite his team’s exciting start to the season, Hubbs believes that the team must concentrate on making improvements both offensively and defensively in order to continuing their winning streak.
“I think that we need to continue to grind out at bats, and on the mound we need to be a little bit more consistent with our starts,” Hubbs said. “I think we’re working too hard at times to finish guys off. We have guys at two strikes a lot and just not finishing the at-bat off on the mound. We just need those guys who are starting to improve so they can give us strong starts throughout.”
As the Trojans move to take on UCI and Washington State this weekend — the first conference series on the season — Hubbs feels that the Trojans must step up their game and continue to come up with big plays in tight spots to secure wins.
“There are some really good pitchers in our league that we will come up against that we’re going to need to win some games 2-1 and 3-2 and not rely on having to score 6,7 or 8 runs to win; that won’t be a great recipe for success in our conference,” Hubbs said. “Right now, we’re just focused on enhancing what we’ve already been doing, refining it, making sure that were locked into it, continuing to work on our base running and just striving to play really clean baseball.”
Follow the sport will you. Trojans ranked 14th in the nation after weekend sweep.
Steve B, it is quite sad that you never have anything nice to say :( Your constant rude comments are just unnecessary. If you disagree with the Daily Trojan’s reporting, simply stop reading it. These kids are hard-working reporters with big futures and you are an internet troll. Maybe a new hobby would bring you more happiness. Since you are so passionate about USC baseball, why not start a baseball blog?
What the hell do you know about Trojan athletics. Tell me about their big futures. Check the stats before you present the supposed facts in an article. I actually was in error as the Trojans were ranked 9th and 6th in two different polls. You Mindy are a piece of work with your asinine comment. Don’t like what I say do the same and ignore it.

Los Angeles is well known for its yearlong perfect weather, and as a result the endless amount of outdoor activities the city offers. Though throwing footballs on the McCarthy Quad or tanning by the Lorenzo pool are good ways to soak up the sun, it’s time to venture out and explore around neighborhoods outside of the USC campus. As spring has finally arrived, what better way to take advantage of the L.A. warmth than trying out water activities in coastal neighborhoods such as Marina del Rey.
Marina del Rey is located right by Venice Beach in the Westside of Los Angeles. It is around a 30-minute drive away from the USC campus. For those that have not heard much about the neighborhood, Marina del Rey, which means “Harbor of the King” in Spanish, is the largest man-made marina in the world. The idea of creating a commercial harbor in the area that became the modern Marina del Rey first began in 1887. The area never successfully developed until around 1953, however, when the harbor became an authorized federal project to moor small craft boats. A few years later in 1965, Marina del Rey was officially born and quickly bloomed into the lively community it is today, thanks to the pleasant weather, beautiful beaches and the touristic development.
The most popular activities to partake in Marina del Rey are obviously on the water. According to the Marina Del Rey Tourism Services, there are six yacht clubs, 19 anchorages and numerous boat clubs. Those from around L.A. can enjoy recreational boating and water sports, and with a flexible budget, there are plenty of clubs to choose from. Most yacht clubs offer cruising, racing and training activities, and they hold high-quality meals and social events for members. Boat clubs range in different kinds and experience levels. As a college student though, unless you’re joining a club with your family, membership might be very pricey and the people you meet might not be in the same age group as your usual social circle.
For students that are looking to spend a weekend experiencing recreational water activities in Marina del Rey, rentals and classes are a much easier and more realistic option. Whether one is looking to kayak, sail, jet ski, paddleboard, row, fish or even just to sit back and enjoy a cruise and a beautiful view, one can easily find charters, rentals or classes in the area. Most of them are either charged on an hourly or half-day basis. The diverse options also allow you to pick affordable or pricey places based on your budget.
But there is still plenty to do for those who don’t love the water. For eco-friendly, environmental enthusiasts, some organizations in Marina del Rey serve opportunities to tour or volunteer in the Ballona Wetlands. For bikers, the Marvin Braude Coastal Bike Trail has a gorgeous scenic route from Torrance Beach to Will Rogers State Beach.
At this point, one might be a little worried about how costly the activities mentioned above seemed. But don’t worry, there is a lot one can do in Marina del Rey without splashing out. First, the Marina del Rey beach, albeit its small size, is a lovely, quiet beach for people who are looking for an alternative to the more commercial, touristy beaches in L.A. This beach is less busy and more family oriented. If you’re in a mood for a relaxed stroll on a sunny day, Burton W. Chace Park is a perfect spot for breathing in some fresh air while appreciating incredible views of the ocean and the green. The park is also excellent for weekend picnics. Another good location for a nice stroll is the Burke Marina Walk Promenade, which provides a nice view of the entire harbor and scenic yachts. The Fisherman’s Village is a replica of a New England fishing town. It is yet another strolling destination in Marina del Rey. Inside the village, there are also restaurants, shops and galleries, and, most importantly, there are free weekend concerts all year round.
Marina del Rey might not be as well-known as Venice Beach and Santa Monica when it comes to shopping and dining, but there are many great options in the area. The farmer’s market in the corner of Via Marina and Admiralty Way is open every Thursday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. There, you can find fresh fruit and vegetables, food vendors and crafts. Waterside, a shopping center on Admiralty Way, offers a variety of stores and dining options. Restaurant chains Mendocino Farms and Sugarfish receive especially good reviews. Then there’s Marina Marketplace on Maxella Avenue, the largest shopping mall in Marina del Rey, with a variety of restaurants, beauty salons and cafes. There’s also an AMC Dine-In Theater in the shopping mall that provides a unique movie experience for 21-plus viewers with high-quality food and beverages served during the movies. Since you’re by the ocean, you might be expecting some seafood by the beach. Beachside Restaurant & Bar, Tony P’s and Killer Shrimp all provide the beach view experience with highly rated seafood. These places are pricier than most restaurants in shopping areas, however.

Possibly the most surprising thing about the upcoming movie Cinderella is its lack of surprises. It’s definitely rare to find a modern, live-action movie based on a Disney classic that doesn’t have some sort of twist on the original story. Snow White became the teen drama Sydney White, Sleeping Beauty was reimagined from the perspective of the villainess in Maleficent, and classic Disney storylines and themes were thrown together and poked fun at in Enchanted. Cinderella, however, is one movie where you can expect to watch the beloved classic in all its original glory. The period, storyline and characters are all exactly as they were in the 1950 animated film.
The only additions to this 2015 version are a little more time spent exploring Ella’s “golden childhood” and a scene where she unknowingly meets Prince “Kip” while horse-riding in a forest. This formatting is not without drawbacks, however. Just like in the original feature, this Cinderella (played by Lily James) is more than a little two-dimensional and certainly an uninspiring female heroine compared to what we are now used to seeing on screen. With Kenneth Branagh directing and a screenplay by Chris Weitz, audiences are bound to have high hopes for this adaptation. After all, what’s the point of updating a wildly successful classic film if not to add something pertinent and meaningful to it? Unfortunately, the dialogue is painfully cliche with only sub-par acting to bring it to life (with the exception of Cate Blanchett’s portrayal of the evil stepmother Lady Tremaine, in which she manages to make even the clumsiest of dialogue sound like Shakespeare). Still, this isn’t a film that’s looking to change the world or go to Sundance, but as a family feature, it certainly hits the mark.
What is extraordinary about this Cinderella are the aesthetics, providing a strong argument for live-action updates of animated classics. The costumes are nothing short of breathtaking, with Lady Tremaine’s sweeping green gowns capturing the essence of the character perfectly without ever overshadowing Blanchett’s performance, and a blue ball gown for Cinderella that is sure to make any fairytale fanatic’s wildest dreams come true. Three-time Oscar-winning costume designer Sandy Powell arguably steals the show, with sumptuous gowns and warm colors dominating the screen. Powell stated that she wanted Cinderella’s ball gown to make her look like she was floating when she moved, and the waterfall hoop skirt coupled with James’ elegance create an ethereal effect. These costumes are set against the most delicious backdrops that will satisfy even the most lavish of imaginations. The beautiful and quaint cottage of Ella’s upbringing seems, fittingly, straight out of a fairy tale, and the gold-dripping opulence of the king’s palace is a dead ringer for awe-inspiring palaces of the Russian tsars.
Perhaps the most notable element missing from this version of Cinderella is song. The original movie charmed audiences with Cinderella’s tragically uplifting ballad “A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes,” and had us all tapping our feet and supressing huge grins during “Bibbidy Bobbidi Boo.” Undoubtedly the score is sweeping and majestic, but nothing can beat the energy of a full-blown musical.
The emotional resonance of the film is perfect for what it is. As a family film, the darker elements of parental loss and domestic abuse can’t be overplayed but are nevertheless key plot points. Though Ella does seem to recover alarmingly quickly from the successive deaths of her mother and father, the motif of the “Lavender’s Blue” song that her mother sung to her as a child throughout the movie highlights the central role they play in her life, despite their absence. The concepts of positivity, overcoming obstacles, kindness and ultimately, of course, love are the driving force behind every aspect of the production.
For the teens, and even adults, in the audience, there is still much to be enjoyed despite the fluffy dialogue and barrage of sentimentality. Besides the spectacular and breathtaking aesthetics, Blanchett and Helena Bonham Carter bring their phenomenal on-screen presence, and there is the comfort and nostalgia in watching a childhood favorite quite literally come to life on the silver screen in a blaze of glory.
There is no question as to whether this new version of Cinderella can compete with, or ever surpass, the Disney original. The magic, music and originality of the 1950 film is unique, and it holds too dear of a place in audiences’ hearts to easily be replaced. Though this version doesn’t do anything wildly new, it does pay homage to Disney’s timeless classic and modernizes it somewhat for younger audiences. Nothing about it is groundbreaking, but that does not mean it is not a touching, warm and genuine picture. Ultimately, this film is unlikely to break many records, but catching it in theaters is highly recommended. The colors, costumes, scenery and cinematography are a pure delight, and everyone could use a reminder that life can be sweet, and anyone can live happily ever after.

This week, the Los Angeles Police Department got one step closer to ending a battle with the city for higher wages. Officers have been working without a contract since July. This previous contract guaranteed only small 1 or 2 percent pay increases. Under a new, pending contract agreement, however, LAPD salaries will increase by 8.2 percent over the next four years.
The hard truth here is not whether the city can afford pay raises or even whether the officers deserve it. Craig Lally, current president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, put it best when he said, “I don’t think either side wanted this to drag on any longer. Crime is up. Morale is down. We need to move forward.”
In 2007, Los Angeles raised pay for 20,000 civilian employees by 24.5 percent over the span of several years. Over the same time period, police officers’ salaries raised by only 14 percent. Starting salaries for police officers in neighboring counties such as Santa Barbara and 11 other counties are up to thousands of dollars higher than starting salaries in the city of Los Angeles.
The police union attempted to fix these pay gaps last year by asking City Council for across-the-board pay increases. The council offered a raise for about one-tenth of union officers, an increase to overtime cash and an increase in starting salary, but the union denied the offer. According to union officials, these added increases would still not put the police force on par with other counties.
The union was very straightforward in their demands and made it clear to the city that if raises were not given, Los Angeles risked losing their policemen to other counties. “Our officers are not without alternatives,” the Police Protective League former President Tyler Izen said, “Experienced and well-trained officers are desired by police and sheriff’s departments throughout Southern California.”
A public relations firm hired by LAPD released survey data in January, and according to the firm, “residents overwhelmingly care about three things: increased violent crime, officer compensation, and recruitment and retention of our City’s officers.” In addition, the survey indicated that the majority of residents did not agree with the city’s stance on limiting pay raises for officers.
Mayor Eric Garcetti has been limiting pay raises for all city employees in an effort to lower deficits and balance the city’s budget. His goal is to eradicate the spending deficit by 2018.
In order to accommodate this goal and the city’s budget, the union did not take any raises for the next year. The first raise would not be until July 2016, and the last installment would be in place by January 2018. This is a major sacrifice for the union, given that they campaigned for an immediate pay raise. Their sacrifice would allow the mayor to hold off on pay raises and use the money for services until the contract agreement went into effect.
With growing national concern of police brutality, the last thing Los Angeles needs is an angry, small or out-of-control police force. Low morale means low performance, and with a 14.3 percent increase of violent crime in Los Angeles from 2013 to 2014, Garcetti can afford neither low performance nor the loss of officers to other counties. Surely, the city can find enough money in the budget to ensure the most important service it provides: protection of its residents.

On March 6, Los Angeles government officials and the LAPD union reached an agreement on salary raises. According to the Los Angeles Times, “the agreement would grant raises in the last three years of a four-year contract,” and starting in July 2016, “officers would see a 4 [percent] pay increase followed by 2 [percent] increases in 2017 and 2018.” A better healthcare package would also be provided for police officers. Though these conditions are rightful compensations for public service officers, other things must be considered before the city goes through with this plan, or there should not be a pay raise at all.
It is pertinent for police officers to be fairly rewarded for their hard work. My uncle is a police officer, and I’ve seen him work through nights and holidays. There is no day of rest for real-life superheroes. One of my favorite movies is End of Watch, an emotional depiction of the harrowing journeys drug-busters endure. But then I think about revelations like the the string of recent thefts in January at Los Angeles International Airport -— one of the largest incidents of property theft in the airport’s history. The LAPD was accused of careless work in their detection and arrests. Of course, I also think of the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Gardner. Needless to say, not all police officers are good cops.
Perhaps, the solution to the present dilemma is the development of a system to get rid of the bad cops. According to David Brooks of The New York Times, a small portion of police officers actually commit these abuses. There are, however, incidents in which police officers kill civilians and are reinstated to the force. In 2007, Officer Hector Jimenez of Oakland, California, shot and killed an unarmed 20-year-old man. Less than a year later, Jimenez killed yet another unarmed man. Most alarmingly, Jimenez was able to appeal to his union, who reinstated him with pay. The police union, in protecting members such as Jimenez, stagnates police reform.
Brooks says that intricate detection of officers such as Jimenez can be a complicated ordeal. When officers have exhibited “clear incompetence,” their investigation process is much more lenient than that of a civilian. They also have access to resources that would strengthen their case, such as accuser names and testimonials. A mandatory two-day cool-off period also gives officers time to develop a response to refute their accusal.
Even with those conflicts in the justice system, however, there are certain measures that can be implemented by the police union itself. First, as Brooks detailed in his article, officers can wear cameras on their uniforms in order to present an accurate account when needed. Also, court mandates in New York have banned antiquated practices, such as stop-and-frisk, which unfairly targets minority men. Police union leadership should seek funding to implement these practices. An agreement regarding what constitutes proper police behavior needs to be determined before considering salary raises.
So, before the fuzz becomes the dust in our eyes, we must urge the police to consider putting the community’s needs before their own. Before the agreement is solidified between the LAPD union and Mayor Eric Garcetti, a better allocation of funds has to be implemented.

Dani writes “An agreement regarding what constitutes proper police behavior needs to be determined before considering salary raises.” Proper police behavior is well-codified already in LA and other city ordnances regulating the police, in state law and in a vast amount of LAPD policy and procedures. Yes, bad officers break those laws and rules. They deserve corrective action from punishment to criminal charges. But Dani calls for “an agreement.” Agreement between what parties? And why should police raises in general be tied to the bad behavior of a few? The rank and file policemen from captain through patrolmen make no policy, write no regulations, simply try their best to protect and to serve USC and the other people of LA.

The Sunday showdown between No. 3 USC (14-2, 0-1) and No. 2 Stanford (14-1, 1-0) was a thriller that resulted in a 12-9 loss for USC in overtime.
The matchup pitted the last two national champions, who both came in to the game with a lone loss to UCLA. USC star Monica Vavic came into the matchup with 251 goals, four away of tying No. 1 on the USC women’s water polo all-time scoring list.
USC held the momentum in the first quarter and went into the second quarter with a 2-1 lead as both Vavic and Avery Peterson scored. The game changed quickly, however, as Stanford score four unanswered goals in the second to take a 5-2 lead into the half.
Knowing that they still had a good chance, Monica’s answer for getting back in the game and advice for her teammates was simple.
“When Stanford went up by three goals, 5-2, their team was simply working harder than us,” Vavic said.” They were hustling more, they were getting rebounds, they were driving harder, they were communicating better on defense and they were outworking us.”
The third quarter went back and forth. USC’s Jayde Appel struck first with 6:05 left in the period, but on the next possession, Stanford’s Jamie Neushul scored her second of three goals. Then with 3:10 left in the period, Maggie Steffens scored her second of the day to put Stanford up 7-3.
Senior Eike Daube came back less than a minute later with a huge goal of her own to make the score 7-4.  Then, it looked like the Trojans had all the momentum in hand going into the fourth when Monica scored with 41 seconds left, but Grossman would get of a shot that went directly into the back of the net with 8 seconds left. The Women of Troy were still down three but greatly improved from the first half, especially offensively. Daube thinks this improvement was a mental one.
“I think it really came down to changing our mentality and recognizing open opportunities,” Daube said. “I think in the beginning, it was kind of hard to see when you are open to be as aggressive, but we definitely turned that around in the second half.”
The Women of Troy continued to turn it around in the fourth with the spark of sophomore driver Stephania Haralabidis’s goal with 6:52 left to make it 8-6. About two and a half minutes later, Daube would score another big goal to decrease the deficit to one.
With 3:24 left, Gurpreet Sohi stopped the USC run making the score 9-7. Less than 30 seconds later, graduate student Jennifer Stiefel answered right back. Finally, at the 1:34 mark, Haralabidis would tie the game up at 9-9. Stanford had 2 good opportunities to score in the last minute but freshman goalie Victoria Chamorro made two huge saves for the women of and the game headed to overtime.
The Women of Troy were unable to take their momentum into overtime, though. Stanford would go on to score three unanswered goals in overtime to take the game 12-9.
“In overtime again, same as the second quarter, we were complacent in defense, we left holes, we didn’t focus on defending the play all the ways through the end,” Vavic said.
Another missing component for most of overtime was Eike Daube. She got her third ejection and was disqualified early in overtime, though she remained positive about the team’s progression after the game.
“I think it’s still a long season ahead of us and that’s definitely a testament to our character as a team,” Daube said. We’re not the kind of team that gives up, nor do I ever plan to be, but it’s a long season, and I hope that with our mentality being what it is that we continue and hopefully we can finish the season with a national championship. That’s the goal.”
The Women of Troy are back in action in another home game against Arizona State on Friday, March 13 at 6 p.m. Vavic will continue her climb to becoming the program’s all-time leading scorer, currently standing three goals away.

A week ago, The New York Times reported that Hillary Clinton, during the time that she served as secretary of state, corresponded exclusively through a personal email rather than through the government provided system. The extent of her usage of a personal account for government business is unheard of for her position, and should be worrying for the American people.
In order to satisfy record-keeping laws, 55,000 pages of emails were turned over to the State Department. These emails, however, were reviewed and provided by Clinton’s advisers, leaving a litany of questions regarding her reasons for creating a personal account in the first place and the importance of the information that was omitted. It is unclear how many regulations Clinton violated through her actions, if any, but it is by no means unreasonable to be concerned about the motives of her actions.
As a result of this report, Democrats have immediately started trying to minimize the scandal, suggesting that Hillary’s actions were neither unusual or of concern. This is the wrong approach.
Democrats as well as Republicans should be probing into these emails, expecting to find that important information was omitted and being surprised if none is found. One of the greatest checks on governmental power in our system is public outcry.
For instance, during the Watergate Scandal, representatives in Congress were given a strong signal by the American people to prosecute the President, and were therefore given strong political support for their persistent probing into the Nixon White House tapes. This investigation changed the way that presidents were expected to act and created a new standard to which they were to be held accountable.
We should demand a similar inquiry into Clinton’s emails. Though one would hope and expect there to be no incriminating information, a full scale investigation should be staged and supported across party lines. There are few things in this country that can unite the American people. Holding our government officials accountable for their actions should be one of them.

like ALL other politicians don’t have a private email or 3 going on-ninja pleassssee-this is like when they put Martha Stewart in prison for insider trading-ALLL the good old boys were doing much much worse but if a woman is threatening the old boys club they want to crucify her for doing the same things they are doing–and since boner the guy who sent his penis pic to the world while trying to illicit a minor with it is still the house speaker or something then the GOP needs to think twice on this witch hunt

Midterm season is killing us all. You have three midterms in one day and you will probably spend the weekend locked up 24/7 in the library. There’s barely any time for eating, let alone cooking. So here you will find the perfect breakfast dish tailored for college students on a low budget and low on time.
Start your day off right with these breakfast tortillas, Guatemalan style. These delicious burrito-type tortillas will give you the perfect jump start for a full day spent at the library. At least you can say you enjoyed one thing during the day!
This is what you’ll need (everything can be found at your nearest Fresh & Easy):
It’s pretty easy. Place your tortilla on the toaster for 3 minutes to make it crunchy. Then, spread it out on your plate and place the slices of ham on it.

Cook the eggs to your preferred style and also add them to the tortilla. To spice things up, sprinkle the mozzarella cheese and the red pepper flakes over the eggs.

Finally, slice up the avocado and put the pieces on top of the tortilla. Bend the tortilla and its ready to eat!

For a quick, delicious drink to go with it, try this blueberry and banana smoothie.
Add a cup of frozen blueberries and one banana to the blender, along with a cup of Greek yogurt. If you’ve got a sweet tooth, some sugar or vanilla extract might be a good idea. Blend on high speed until smooth, and enjoy.
Good luck studying, fellow Trojans!

I recently read something by Alice Walker about never walking in the same river twice, and though I might have read it before, her words really struck me profoundly as I set foot in Santiago again for my second semester. I had a conversation with another student from the United States who is also studying in Santiago for a year where we both admitted that there was indeed room for improvement from last semester and that this one would be our second chance to do it all again, except better.
But as I was sitting on the beach full of optimism for the semester to come, my backpack was stolen from right behind me.
 (Below: Me in Viña del Mar wearing a stylish plastic biblioteca promo visor and sharing a laugh with dearest backpack, moments before we were forever separated from each other.)
Quyen Nguyen Le | Daily Trojan
I should have known this would happen, not because Viña del Mar is any more “dangerous” than any other city I’ve been in (U.S. or elsewhere), but because Mother did say that Year of the Goat, my year on the Lunar calendar, is going to be a really tough one for me. And also a bird pooped on my shirt an hour before I was robbed. Clearly, an omen!
Well, joke’s on the thief because they got a backpack full things I don’t think they actually want: a T-shirt with bird poop on it, a denim button-up with awkwardly-placed boob pockets, a plastic visor, garbanzo beans, a half eaten avocado, chopsticks, pads, a bus ticket back to Santiago, keys to an apartment they don’t have the address of, a Windows phone (not even the kind with the really nice camera), a wallet filled with my various student I.D.’s (a.k.a. unattractive photos of me) and my debit card, which I promptly reported and blocked before any money was drawn out.
I did have things of significant monetary value in there: my GoPro camera and $127.80 USD, which I’d stashed in my backpack as emergency cash the day before — a terrible idea in retrospect. But I’m more upset about the sentimental things, like my little sister’s beanie that she lent me and a coin purse my other sister got me from Prague.
I’m a bit conflicted about how I should feel about the theft of my possessions:
Part of me is like, “Things are just things! They come and they go; it’s part of travelling,” but another part of me is like, “things are just things…that cost a lot of money! Only rich people can afford to say that things don’t matter in our capitalist world.” Regardless, I have to deal because it already happened. It really does suck to have to have to dish out time and money to replace all the things. But then again, I’m fortunately at a point in my life where I can afford to replace most of those things, or at least live without them.
I focused more on how to resolve it and didn’t stress out too much when it happened, unlike last semester when I accidentally dropped my wallet in a taxi and had to figure out the immense bureaucracy involved in replacing each missing item. I think this time around, it helped to have awesome friends to support me in handling the situation better– and that’s what this second semester is supposed to be about, right? Doing all the things, positive and negative, better?
So I drank two delicious mango smoothies and began replacing my lost things, starting with this backpack from Valparaíso with the words “A Day to Remember” (which apparently is a “post hardcore” band from Florida a.k.a. the kind of white boy music I worshipped in middle school) to commemorate the occasion:

It’s now March, which means it is time to be seduced by bubble watches and seed projections. It is the month of Selection Sunday, upset-minded “little guys” and guaranteed mayhem.
Ah, yes. The NCAA Tournament is right around the corner.
The ACC features tournament favorites like Virginia and Duke, while the Big 12 offers plenty of intrigue with heavyweights such as Kansas and Baylor. Likewise, Pac-12 powerhouses Arizona and Utah have been mainstays in the top 25 this season and should be able to do some serious damage in the tourney. The Big Ten will supply the brackets with plenty of known commodities like Wisconsin and Michigan State, while the Big East weighs in with the likes of Villanova and Georgetown.
But what about the SEC?
Kentucky has stolen the show, coasting through the regular season to a flawless 31-0 record. Yet, much like ACC football this past season with Florida State going undefeated in regular season play, it has been relatively easy to forget about the other teams in the conference.
After a trip to last year’s Final Four, Florida defined mediocrity this season (15-16, 8-10 SEC). The Gators were far and away the conference’s biggest disappointment, as Billy Donovan’s squad struggled mightily and won just three of 12 games between January 17 and February 24. But after last year’s mass exodus of senior leaders, the Gators were due for a letdown season.
The SEC East is also the home of the Missouri Tigers, who have been surprisingly average since their move from the Big 12. A 9-22 record has put the Tigers at the bottom of the SEC standings, while Tennessee and South Carolina have posted .500 records and never really looked like taking the East by storm.
Vanderbilt will have to rely on winning the SEC Tournament in order to make it to the Big Dance, but the Commodores did defeat Kentucky in the 2012 conference tournament championship — the same year the Wildcats won the NCAA Tournament with a star-studded lineup featuring Anthony Davis, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Terrence Jones. The Commodores just downed Ole Miss in Oxford on March 7 and are on a five-game winning streak. Vandy should be able to maintain this momentum in the conference tourney, especially if center Damian Jones (14.5 PPG, 6.3 RPG) dominates in the paint.
Forgetting a team from the East? How about the Georgia Bulldogs? The epitome of a “football school,” Georgia has put together a fine season on the hardwood. The Dawgs are 20-10 and have won four of their last five. They lost to John Calipari’s Wildcats on March 3 — but only by eight points. Mark Fox has the Bulldogs humming just in time for the SEC Tournament.
Georgia’s rise has been impressive, but the beast of the East — and the nation — has been Kentucky all season long. The West, however, has no clear frontrunner.
Instead, parity has defined the competitive play at the top of the division. Arkansas has turned heads with a 24-7 record, and their toasty 17-2 home record is second to none in the SEC West. Though it is difficult to determine just how good the Hogs are, one thing is clear — they take care of business in games in which they are expected to win. There are no glaring losses on their résumé, and they have gone on two seven-game tears this season in which they looked like the real deal.
One of Arkansas’ two home losses came at the hands of LSU, another strong yet enigmatic team. LSU is 22-9 and still needs to prove it is NCAA Tournament material, but the Tigers will be a quality sleeper pick if they indeed go dancing. The Tigers’ frontcourt, led by Jarell Martin and Jordan Mickey (who both average over 16 points and 9 rebounds per game) can be downright terrifying at times. LSU also showed it can win without Mickey, who has been one of the team’s most valuable players this season. In that March 7 clash with the Razorbacks, Mickey did not play against due to injury, but Martin picked up the slack with 27 points and eight boards. Despite the result of the game, Arkansas looks like a lock while LSU appears to be a quintessential bubble team, purely based on each team’s entire body of work this season.
Meanwhile, Auburn will need a “Prayer at Jordan-Hare” type of miracle in order to win the SEC Tournament, while Mississippi State’s chances of making a dent look equally slim. Alabama’s campaign got off to a promising start, but 2015 was not as friendly to the Crimson Tide. Senior guard Levi Randolph has looked bright for ’Bama, but there are just not enough quality W’s on this team’s transcript.
That leaves us with Texas A&M and Ole Miss, two 20-win teams who have been riding the same wave of uncertainty as March Madness approaches. The Aggies forced double-overtime against Kentucky back on January 10 and appeared to be legitimate contenders in the SEC after winning ten of their next 12 in conference play. However, an inability to seal the deal during the business end of the season could very well end up costing Billy Kennedy’s team, as A&M has dropped three of its last four. Ole Miss has also struggled down the stretch, but they could slide into the tournament as a middle-tier seed. The Rebels have not been spectacular, and there are no Marshall Henderson-esque characters to attract national attention. Ole Miss has a handful of ugly — but not hideous — losses (TCU and Western Kentucky, both at home). The Rebels, however, do have important non-conference wins against Cincinnati and Oregon, which could prove to be vital for Andy Kennedy’s team during the selection process.
The SEC should have between four and six teams in the NCAA Tournament. There is quite a bit still hanging in the balance for some of these teams, but the SEC Tournament will answer some burning questions and clear up the conundrum of who in fact deserves the opportunity to lace up their dancing shoes.
The SEC has been informally labeled a “football conference,” but do not be surprised if some of these teams start busting brackets in the NCAA Tournament. Despite the steep drop-off after Kentucky, there is some major flare and excitement to these fresh faces of SEC basketball.
Your bracket will probably be wildly inaccurate, just like it is every year. So, in addition to focusing on arbitrarily chosen sleeper teams, consider the SEC as a whole to be a sleeper conference. There may be a very realistic scenario in which every SEC team in the NCAA Tournament could advance to the round of 32.
Sure, Kentucky is far and away the best of the bunch and ought to be favored to hoist the hardware on April 6, but the next tier of SEC teams vying for tournament bids can flat-out ball.
Do not forget about the villains of March. You know, teams like Arkansas and Georgia. You will be temped to hastily pick recognizable “basketball schools” in your bracket and count out SEC squads left and right, but beware the madness that may ensue.
Known fact: things get awfully weird in March.
