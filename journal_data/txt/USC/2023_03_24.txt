Of the 32 eligible workers, 16 cast ballots in favor of the union and 15 against. The NLRB has certified the results, pending objections about the election process within seven days.
The 32-person union consists of shuttle drivers and dispatchers who operate USC’s intercampus shuttle lines.
“This historic win puts us in the driver’s seat, and gives us the ability to win fair pay, better benefits, and a voice on the job,” wrote James Sims, a USC shuttle driver, in a media release Thursday afternoon. “We’re confident that this historic election will not only improve the lives of shuttle drivers who are the backbone of the University’s transportation system, but also raise up the quality of services that we provide for our passengers.”
The win came at a busy moment for local labor movements: Los Angeles Unified School District workers concluded a three-day strike Thursday, thousands of USC graduate student workers won the right to unionize in February and 48,000 University of California academic workers staged a mammoth six-week strike last December.
Local 721 wrote on Twitter Thursday that USC’s shuttle drivers were some of the last remaining non-union transit workers in the L.A. region. The union also wrote that USC’s drivers earn $18 per hour with merit-based raises, as opposed to unionized workers at UCLA who make $22.74 to $30.58 per hour.
“Our historic union victory today puts us on the path to win what we deserve,” Sims wrote. “We look forward to coming together with the University very soon, and in good faith, to begin the bargaining process to negotiate our first union contract at USC.”
USC shuttle drivers and dispatchers rallied Tuesday in support of their bid to unionize and join the Service Employees International Union Local 721. The group of some 50 workers and students marched from the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work to Tommy Trojan, catching attention from passersby on Trousdale Parkway.
Broadly, the workers are seeking better pay and benefits, as well as disciplinary and grievance processes that include union representation, according to a Local 721 media advisory dated Tuesday.
“Like every union, our shuttle drivers want respect on the job, a voice on the job and benefits that respect the fact that they’ve been here for many years,” said Felipe Caceres, a coordinator with Local 721. “So shuttle drivers are demanding a union: a say on the job … a seat at the table.”
The prospective union of 30 drivers and two dispatchers — who coordinate routes and direct shuttle drivers over the radio — filed for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board Feb. 6. The Board filed a notice of election Tuesday morning, setting the date for March 23. The fate of the union will hinge on a simple majority vote.
Local 721’s website boasts that its over 95,000 workers comprise the “largest public sector union in Southern California.” In its media advisory Friday, the union accused USC of engaging in “union-busting” tactics in an effort to stop the campaign.
“USC managers have sent deceptive emails to drivers and dispatchers with anti-union messages,” the release read. “Drivers also fear that USC managers — as they’ve done during past union campaigns — may also start holding ‘captive audience’ meetings to spread misinformation and dissuade workers from voting YES to form a union.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan Tuesday, the University wrote that it values “[its] shuttle drivers and the important work they do,” but that it does “not believe they need a third party to speak for them.”
“That said, we respect our drivers’ right to decide for themselves whether or not they wish to have a union represent them, and this decision should be made through the election scheduled for March 23,” the statement read.
The statement did not address questions regarding Local 721’s accusation of union-busting.
The shuttle workers’ effort comes on the heels of a major victory for a union of thousands of graduate student workers at USC, who secured the right to unionize in mid-February. Of the more than 1,700 ballots cast in that union’s election with the National Labor Relations Board, 93% were in favor of unionization.
Similarly, a supermajority of the shuttle workers filed union authorization cards earlier this month, triggering the late-March election.
The March 23 election will run between noon and 4 p.m. on the University Park Campus at the USC Hotel. A vote earlier that morning at Parking Lot 70 on the Health Sciences Campus will run between 10 a.m. and noon.
— TOMOKI CHIENTomoki Chien is the labor correspondent for the Daily Trojan.
USC shuttle drivers and dispatchers will vote on unionization March 23, according to National Labor Relations Board documents posted Tuesday morning. The workers are rallying Tuesday at 11:45 a.m. in front of the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work in support of their unionization bid.

In 1804, a group of formerly enslaved people emerged victorious against the tyranny of French colonists in Haiti, making history as the first nation in the Americas to abolish slavery. However, the victory proved to be bitterly pyrrhic. A bitter France forced Haiti to pay 112 million francs in reparations to their own enslavers under persistent threat of an invasion, leaving Haiti in crippling debt. Though the United States finally recognized Haiti’s independence in 1862, economic sanctions, incessant political instability and the Cold War (not to mention a U.S. occupation from 1915-34 following the assassination of the Haitian president) left Haiti dependent on foreign aid in the form of food and medical supplies.
Around the turn of the 21st century, amid a coup d’etat that overthrew democratically-elected Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the U.S. and United Nations decided to rebrand its interventions in the nation as humanitarian aid. From 2004 to 2017, the U.N. operated a peacekeeping mission in Haiti, codenamed MINUSTAH, which Haitians have accused of introducing cholera and abetting widespread sexual abuse.
As of Tuesday, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is again calling for deployment of specialized forces in Haiti to take down the ongoing gang violence brutalizing the country. The UN announced Tuesday that 187 people have been killed in the past 11 days amid the political turmoil following the 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse.
On Wednesday, I phoned Niels Frenzen, clinical professor of law and director of the Immigration Clinic at the Gould School of Law, to discuss the history of U.S.-Haiti relations and the potential impacts of another foreign intervention should it occur. Frenzen, who has been teaching at USC since 2000, previously served as the supervising attorney at the Haitian Refugee Center, a “Haitian refugee-founded and Haitian refugee-run” organization based in Miami. 
“Very few Haitians’ asylum claims were successful,” Frenzen recalled from his work at the HRC. “Back in the day — I can’t remember what the approval rate was for Haitian asylum applications, but it was somewhere in the neighborhood of less than 2%.” As of 2021, Haitian migrants still have the lowest asylum approval rate since 2018, at just under 5%.
The particular racism historically directed at Haiti was precisely due to the U.S.’ fear of similar uprisings in their own country inspired by the Haitian Revolution, uprooting a system that massively benefited white plantation owners.
“Haiti was already seen as a threat to the United States from day one of Haitian independence,” Frenzen told me. “One can never overstate the role that race has played, in that [Haiti] is a predominantly Black country, and has suffered because of institutional racism — [which] is so much a part of the American experience.”
Such racism has manifested, and continues to manifest, in the U.S.’ response to Haitian migrants seeking asylum. The (senior) Bush administration in 1991 refused to grant asylum to migrants fleeing that year’s coup d’etat — which saw the deposition of Aristide — claiming their applications were on the basis of “economic conditions” and not political persecution. Former President Donald Trump, followed by his successor Joe Biden, used the coronavirus pandemic “as an excuse to prevent people from pursuing asylum in the United States,” Frenzen told me, enacting Title 42 expulsions to prevent migrants’ entry into the U.S.
In some cases, the imagery is hardly abstract: As recently as September 2021, video footage emerged of Border Patrol officers on horseback appearing, to some, to whip Haitian migrants as they crossed the Rio Grande. A nine-month federal investigation concluded that agents did not use whips but did maneuver their horses dangerously around the migrants and used denigrating language.
As for foreign interventions in Haiti itself, Frenzen told me that while he believed in the concept of “humanitarian intervention by force,” he still had his doubts about how exactly it would be executed.
“The United Nations and the U.S. and Canada, among other countries, have been talking about renewed intervention of some sort in Haiti, and that has been done,” Frenzen said. “It has been done for over 100 years, on several occasions, and nothing good comes of it… There aren’t many good options — if any good options — that are on the table,” he told me.
But Haiti is stuck — ruined by “humanitarian” efforts that are really just covers for exploitation, yet, having been crippled by said efforts, ironically reliant on them to survive. By the end of our conversation, neither Frenzen nor I had any confidence in yet another military intervention changing Haiti for the better, should it actually take place.
“What would the United States — or, what would an international force do?” Frenzen said. “It’s not a situation where we have two armies fighting one another and we’re talking about putting peacekeepers … it’s just unclear what a military force would do, other than to go in and kill people. Is that the stated objective? To go in eliminating gangs by killing and locking them up?”
Even the U.S. is doubtful about doing it all over again; opinion after opinion from former ambassadors to Haiti beg the international community not to make the same mistakes it did over 20 years ago. James B. Foley, ex-U.S. ambassador to Haiti, wrote for The Atlantic that “the chances of success for a Haitian government that emerges from elections will still depend on the willingness of the U.S. and its partners to invest the resources required to build state institutions and address Haiti’s overwhelming needs.” Whether the U.S. will be so willing remains to be seen, especially when, as Frenzen told me, its only interests are “keeping Haitians in Haiti” and — to a lesser extent — keeping communism out.
Haiti is a test. The U.S. has had a significant racial reckoning in the past few years; it only took some 60 years after the civil rights movement and a nauseating amount of Black people to be murdered for it to happen, but nonetheless, it’s here. And yes, there was police reform, Black Lives Matter Plaza, Democratic congressmembers kneeling and wearing Ghanaian kente cloth and a San Francisco city-appointed committee proposing $5 million each in reparations to eligible Black adults. But how we respond to Haiti’s crisis — how, if at all, we help rebuild a nation whose very foundations are in Black power and resistance — will tell us if we’ve actually learned anything since then.

As a journalist, the First Amendment is one of the most important sections in the United States Constitution to me. With it, the free media can investigate and report on government misconduct, allowing citizens access to all sides of every issue without government interference. Without it, our ability to create our own judgments is vastly hindered as misinformation runs rampant under the guise of “news” while the truth lies hidden behind the walls of those in power. 
In looking at the strategies governments have adopted to manipulate the media, the issue of censorship is often discussed with authoritarian countries such as North Korea, China, Saudi Arabia and Iran in mind. Whether through tactics such as blatant harassment and coercion or more sophisticated surveillance and internet blockage, these governments withhold information to maintain control of their citizens and stay in power.  
While censorship is an issue in the U.S., it takes shape in a less aggressive form with book bans and a limited education curriculum. As these cases, such as New York Times Co. v. United States and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, reach federal courts and spread through the media like wildfire, there is still hope that the First Amendment will continue to protect our freedom of speech. But what about a more subtle form of censorship, one that the First Amendment cannot protect us from? What do we do in the face of self-censorship, especially in journalism?
The First Amendment doesn’t allow us to say as we so please. Unprotected forms of speech include defamation, incitement, child pornography and more. Ethics and integrity are the bedrock of journalism and editors are responsible for protecting these qualities to the best of their abilities. If we were to completely negate the importance of editing, unprotected speech finds its way into journalism. However, the situation changes when your writing and editing is based on fear. 
In the words of Aidan White, founder of the Ethical Journalism Network, “When a journalist or editor makes an editorial decision over a story and its contents that is motivated by the threat of reprisal — whether from the state, the police, the owner, or the advertiser — it is nothing to do with the principles of good journalism.”
Research on self-censorship began in the 1950s at McCarthyism’s peak when dissent was associated with communism and consequences were dire, to say the least. However, according to Sara Savat, senior news director for business and social sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, “despite the very real potential consequences, only 13.4% of Americans said they engaged in self-censorship at the time. Over the past 70 years, however, that number has tripled.”
The Pew Research Center found in a 2000 study that out of nearly 300 journalists and news executives, 41% of reporters admit that they have either purposefully avoided newsworthy stories, “softened the tone of stories to benefit the interests of their news organizations” or both. Unable to find a more recent statistic, I can only imagine what these numbers look like with the data Savat cited.
But this is what writers of color have always had to do, lest they dare challenge their white counterparts and put themselves at risk. “We were not allowed to make mistakes,” explained author Wajahat Ali at a town hall discussion covered by the New York Times, “You don’t get to fail up, and write endlessly about cancel culture from prestigious outlets.”
I’ve noticed that with every article I write, the initial draft is always stronger than the final, but it’s never the one that is published because of the (perhaps illogical) idea that I only have a few chances to say what I want to say. We often ignore the harms of our own self-censoring that isn’t a direct result of government control or threats. When we dilute our own thoughts, what we are left with is just another version of mainstream thinking. 
When navigating the ethics of writing, writers must take into consideration their audience and the tone of their argument. But when “caution” becomes synonymous with ethical journalism, the balance of telling the public what they want to know and what they need to know begins to tip towards the side of the former. In doing so, our own beliefs begin to change and grow smaller in fear of upsetting the norm. Fear is a powerful tool that those in power use to silence minority voices, but other times we are our own worst enemy and it’s our own misplaced fear silencing our own voices.

I’ve always been an eclectic music listener — my Spotify Wrapped always contains genres I’ve never even heard of from all across the musical spectrum. Seriously, what is escape room? Growing up, I never restricted music based on genre. My first iPod shuffle was loaded with my dad’s personal library of almost exclusively country music. My mom encouraged me to listen to her hip hop and rock college faves, like the Beastie Boys and Nirvana.
Like any music consumer, I have my preferences. From Orville Peck to The Strokes to Fraxiom, I try to cover a lot of territory that usually falls into “alternative.” My ears require a diverse nutritional palate, and Spotify is their dedicated server ringing up orders for an extra serving of Bay Faction. Despite my best efforts and love for a punk rock voice run ragged, one genre has always escaped my grasp: metal.
I’ve sampled some cross-genre metal before. Poppy’s “I Disagree” contrasts heavy metal vocals against pop instrumentals, intertwining into a unique experience Poppy herself describes as “post-genre.” Zheani, an Australian rapper, calls her sound “fairy trap,” a mix of rap, pop and metal. These artists bring a metal flair to their otherwise pop sound. But no artist has managed to grab my attention into prog rock-nu metal deliciousness quite like Gnome.
Gnome isn’t quite a “true metal” band. In fact, they refer to themselves as a “stoner rock band,” yet another genre that will steadily climb its way up my Spotify Wrapped next year. I know, I know — metalheads out there may protest at calling Gnome “metal music” when they don’t even claim it themselves. Please hear me out!
Heavy metal is a transgressive, experimental genre. With roots in psychedelic rock and a flair for the flamboyant, metal has carved out a niche for the tumultuous, rebellious, and subcultural. So it doesn’t seem so crazy that three guys with pointy red hats and an impressive vocal range would fit right in.
My first exposure to Gnome was incidental. Scrolling through YouTube, a man in a tall pointed red hat, long beard and shiny golden stockings caught my eye. I watched as he danced in what I can only describe as “the most dad moves ever” to some truly impressive riffs. Naturally, I immediately absorbed every single music video Gnome had on YouTube, then added their entire discography to my Spotify playlist.
There is something completely fascinating about watching a gnome prance about to rock music. At the time, Gnome couldn’t escape my mind. I was knee-deep in finals, grad school applications and medical appointments, trying to keep it all balanced through the end of the year. “Just one more week,” I would think. And after that week, “just one more.” I didn’t leave my apartment except to take an exam, my social life essentially crushed. My lack of control over the situation only exacerbated the emotional and social consequences. “It’s all serious business, now,” I would think. The grimness of my physical state would surely pass.
It didn’t. How could it? I was trapped in a humorless spiral, splintered from my usually joyful self. Goofiness was a distraction. I chose to turn off my emotions and eventually, they just left.
Enter: Gnome. The silliness was unparalleled. It was like the wackiness spigot in my mind suddenly unclogged, unleashing a wave of something in my brain I couldn’t recognize in the moment. The mere sight of a pointed red hat had revived a part deep within me I couldn’t explain to anyone else. As I poured over Gnome’s music, their fantastical world of revolting gnomes and mythical underground creatures spoke to my own internal disconnect from the world I was in. 
Gnome’s rebellion wasn’t pure rage or gloom: It was a celebration of the outcast, the individual that chooses to be silly in a grievously serious world. I try to remember to let myself have a taste of frivolous joy, even when it’s the toughest thing I can do. In dark moments, sometimes you just have to put on a pointed hat and get a little goofy.

Josh Kun, a professor and chair in cross-cultural communication at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, will serve as USC’s first-ever vice provost for the arts, President Carol Folt announced in a Universitywide email Thursday morning. Kun will assume the role Sept. 1 while continuing to teach and advise students at Annenberg.
Kun will “serve as both innovative curator and ultimate connector” by supporting artistic efforts on campus and also engaging the community beyond the walls of USC, Folt wrote in the email.
The vice provost for the arts is tasked with supporting the artistic community in Los Angeles with new initiatives, fundraising and programs in partnership with the University’s six art schools and the USC museums. 
Kun said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that, because the role did not exist previously, he will be able to build the position in collaboration with different players on campus and amplify work both at the University and in the city of L.A. He spoke about potential projects he may take on, such as having artists in residence on campus, creating ways to showcase the artistic work of USC students to communities beyond L.A., and holding a USC Arts Festival. 
Kun added that he is seeking to create pathways “for the arts to go beyond the arts.” He hopes to explore the intersections between arts and economics, sociology and more. 
As a part of his role, Kun will also serve as chair of a USC Public Arts Committee to organize policies concerning public art around the University, such as why certain pieces belong on campus.
“I’m excited to think about the campus as a space of curation,” Kun said. “These artistic moments around campus [can] be opportunities for new kinds of reflection, new kinds of thinking, new kinds of emotional experiences.”
Music is one of Kun’s major passions because of its ability to connect communities, revealing cultural histories of exchange, he said. 
“Music, like so many other artistic forms, allows different individuals with different backgrounds to find ways to be in community with each other without sacrificing their individuality, so that [they] can be together in difference,” he said. “That’s a gift music has given me, and it’s a model that I want to try to use to inspire the work that I’m going to do.”
Kun expressed a sense of excitement for the months to come as he steps into his new role. 
“I’m really excited to have more and more conversations,” Kun said. “I’m really excited about meeting new folks, learning about work that I don’t know about yet, introducing the USC arts communities to key arts partners around the country and around the world who might not know the depth and breadth of what we do.”

A tall task lies ahead for the No. 11 USC men’s volleyball team this week as they travel to the 18-story high Walter Pyramid Friday for their matchup against No. 4 Long Beach State. The matchup will be the first of two meetings against the Beach for the Trojans, as the two teams will play again at Galen Center Saturday. 
Long Beach has historically been a tough matchup for the Trojans, especially as of late, with USC going 2-8 in their last 10 meetings. The Trojans are also in the midst of a slump after losing two games in a row to No. 7 Pepperdine earlier this month. Their losses caused them to slide down from No. 10 to No. 11 in the AVCA rankings. 
Long Beach, on the other hand, is coming off of their best win of the season, defeating No. 1 ranked Hawaii in Honolulu last Friday. The Trojans are, decidedly, underdogs. However, there may be an advantage to the Trojans’ underdog status. 
“If you go in as a lower seed, you could say there’s a little less pressure,” said Head Coach Jeff Nygaard in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “It’s a little bit of that March Madness Cinderella team that goes in and plays a lot freer, because it’s like, ‘Well, they’re supposed to win so let’s just go in there and turn it loose.’”
The matches will be the final non-conference matches of the season for the Trojans before a gauntlet of six conference games to finish out the season. With the pressure of conference standings out of their mind for a few games, this could be a good opportunity for the Trojans to refine their ability to keep their composure against great teams. 
The Trojans will also be 13 days removed from their last match when they square off against Long Beach, a break that they found advantageous. 
 “We were able to take a look at what we’re doing and knowing this is as a group what we need to do  …  for the rest of the season so we can set those goals and strive for them,” Nygaard said. “From the players’ standpoint, they got a nice little break and a mental refresh to come back strong.” 
The players echoed that sentiment, saying it was a welcomed recovery period. 
“It’s been a long season, and we just needed to get our bodies right,” said graduate outside hitter Kevin Kobrine. “Some of our shoulders, knees and hamstrings are just tight, and it was good to just loosen up and recover from that.” 
Kobrine is also looking to bounce back after a few games that saw his usual production take a dip. The usually prolific outside hitter is third on the team with 159 kills on the season, an average of about 9.35 kills per match, but has only had 10 kills total in his past two matches. Fortunately, he has not let the decrease in statistical output get him down, instead channeling his focus into constant improvement.
“I look at every game as an opportunity to improve at skills I have been struggling with or skills I am good at currently, so hopefully I can do well, I’ve been working hard,” Kobrine said. 
The series against the Beach seems like the prime time for Kobrine to find the hot hand and rack up kills, which would greatly help the Trojans in beating their formidable opponent. 
Kobrine is also living in the moment, he said, trying to enjoy his last few games against Southern California schools that he has lots of good memories playing against. 
“I know a lot of players on all of the California teams, and I grew up playing with them,” Kobrine said. “So it’s fun to start playing with them when you’re like 14, 15, and now we’re in college playing.” 
With such a good series matchup across two iconic venues, the weekend should be enjoyable for everyone.
“We know it’s going to be a fun weekend of volleyball, and that’s what this is supposed to be, is fun,” Nygaard said. 
Trojan fans can watch their team take on Long Beach Friday at 7 p.m. at the Walter Pyramid or on ESPN+, and then again Saturday at 7 p.m. at Galen Center and on the USC livestream.

Coming off of a 17-6 win against Arizona State last week, the women’s lacrosse team will look to continue their 4-game home win streak against Colorado Friday and Oregon Sunday. 
Currently, the Trojans are ranked No. 18 in the nation and sit in second in the Pac-12 with a 6-2 overall record. Despite posting a 3-4 overall record, the Colorado Buffaloes sit atop the Pac-12 standings having defeated Stanford and the UC Berkeley. 
Redshirt sophomore attacker Isabelle Vitale, who leads the team in assists and is tied for first in points, believes the team can attribute their success to both their high-powered offense and strong defense.  
“We’re just going to use the momentum from ASU and continue building connection on our offense and then with the defense,” Vitale said. “They’ve been doing such a great job with stopping opposing teams so just continue what we’ve been doing and trust in our prep and we will perform well.”
Head Coach Lindsey Munday has set her sights on winning a bid to the NCAA tournament but is still focused on winning the next game. Last year, the Trojans made the tournament, losing in the first round to Virginia. The team has reached the NCAA tournament five times in the past 10 years of the program’s history and reached the quarterfinals twice — in 2016 and 2017. 
“If you win your conference, you get a bid to the NCAA and that opportunity to keep playing,” Munday said. “So that’s top of mind. But we have to take it one game at a time. And just like we always do, just focus on Colorado right now because they’re our next opponent.”
USC is the only Pac-12 team ranked in the top 25 teams in the nation. The Trojans also lead the Pac-12 in goals per game at 12.5 and rank second in average goals against at 8.25. Colorado is fourth in goals per game and second in average goals against and Oregon is third in goals per game and third in average goals against. 
The team has also historically dominated Colorado and Oregon, winning its last two matchups against the Buffaloes and its last six matchups against the Ducks. 
The women’s lacrosse roster has welcomed new faces from the transfer portal and a slate of freshmen. Senior attacker Ella Heaney, a returning veteran, believes the team’s close-knit culture has been one of the key components to its success.  
“Our chemistry throughout this year and the years past has really just been making an effort to connect with everyone, whether off the field, on the field, no matter the grade and that’s really helped us build our team as a whole and become USC lacrosse,” Heaney said. 
USC will face off against Colorado at McAlister Field at 3 p.m. Friday and Oregon at noon Sunday.

When I first began writing this column, I focused on sustainable stadiums, with Seattle’s appropriately-named Climate Pledge Arena and SoFi Stadium stealing the show. However, there’s a stadium close to home that I did not mention — although it was briefly featured in my electrifying aluminum versus plastic bottles column.
The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is among the most sustainable stadiums on the West Coast. A three-time winner of the Pac-12 Zero Waste Challenge, the Coliseum boasted impressive waste diversion numbers in the 2022 football season.
Zero waste, by the industry’s standards, is achieved when 90% or more of waste materials are diverted from landfills through either recycling or composting. This figure isn’t set at 100% because some fans bring their own products, some of which are not compostable. In the 2022 football season, the Coliseum reached zero waste in six of USC’s seven home games, a rate strong enough to earn them the 2022 Green Sports Alliance Net Zero Waste Champion honors.
While President Carol Folt is often credited with igniting a push for a more sustainable campus, the Coliseum’s sustainability efforts began in 2015, four years before Folt was hired.
“Nobody told us we had to do this. We did all the legwork and all these different things to make it happen,” said Matthew Buswell, director of stadium operations for the Coliseum. “When President Folt came over, everything we were doing, it was like ‘Oh, the Coliseum’s already doing this.’”
Diverting trash from filling up already overflowing landfills is certainly an accomplishment. Think about your most recent game day experience at the Coliseum. When you headed out (hopefully not at halftime as much of the student section has often been prone to do), remember how much trash you saw? Popcorn boxes, crushed beer cans and a myriad of other products the Coli sells fill the stands after each game. In fact, the lowest amount of trash in a single game last season still amounted to more than 8 tons. For the whole season, the stadium sent only 8% of this trash to landfills, with an impressive 59% carted off for composting.
Part of the Coliseum’s efficacy in their zero waste efforts also lies in their attempts at using sustainable products. The entire USC campus eliminated the sale of single-use plastic beverage containers and water bottles in July 2022, resulting in an influx of primarily aluminum bottles — from the Coliseum to Seeds. Additionally, many of the products sold in the Coliseum are compostable.
“You can’t have zero waste if you’re putting non-compostable, non-compliant items into the waystream,” Buswell said. “If a vendor comes in … we provide them [with] a list of approved items. If they don’t have that, say they’re going to try to serve off of Styrofoam, we will confiscate that.” 
Composting, the natural breakdown of organic matter, is a much more sustainable alternative to landfills. Fungi, worms, insects and bacteria break down the waste — which would otherwise emit methane in a landfill — and produce compost, which can be used to improve soil quality. Composting still emits carbon dioxide, but at a much lower clip than sending waste to landfills.
Recycling is also a complicated process that still emits CO2. However compared to letting items sit in a landfill, recycling is a worthwhile endeavor, particularly for aluminum cans — a frequent purchase inside the Coliseum’s walls.  
According to the United Nations, about one-third of food produced worldwide goes to waste. The Coliseum seeks to reverse that pattern by partnering with the St. Francis branch of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank to donate excess food, contributing nearly 1.5 tons of food in the 2022 football season.
Achieving this success is no easy task. As many as 145 employees contribute to the waste organizing process, spending hours sorting through every bag of trash from an event, making sure that each item is sent to the appropriate destination.
“For the most part, everything is compostable or recyclable,” Buswell said. “Obviously we still have nacho cheese cups or the ketchup packets, the souvenir cups … but all of the serviceware, so plates, forks, napkins, cups, [are] all compostable.”
Stadiums across the country are making efforts to emulate sustainability practices such as those that the Coliseum follows. While teams are always encouraged to compete without limits on the field, by sharing their practices, stadiums can lessen the impact sports have on the climate by prioritizing sustainability.
The United Nations stated in their most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that the number of people facing water scarcity in cities would double by 2050 — meaning 2.4 billion people would be in crisis. To avoid these dire consequences, we must integrate sustainability into our daily lives — including in the Coliseum.
Patrick Warren is an associate managing editor and a senior writing about the relationship between sports and climate change. His column, “The World of Sports,” runs every other Friday.

On paper, the School of Architecture is a “dynamic platform for educating and inspiring citizen architects” via “a foundation of rigorous research and inspired design” that has a century-long legacy of pushing “beyond the traditional boundaries of the field.”
But a growing disillusionment is challenging this narrative, as some students — surveyed and interviewed by the Daily Trojan over the past two months — said excessive workloads, financial burden and volatile communication with faculty and staff are fostering a stressful environment in the program.
Survey
The Daily Trojan surveyed students in the School of Architecture beginning Feb. 20 about their experiences in the program. Forty-four students responded: twenty-two in their first year, nine in their second and 13 in their third.
Respondents were first prompted to rate the quality of communication in the program on a scale of one to 10. Communication between faculty and students averaged at 4.6, while perceived inter-faculty communication earned a 4.25. For both, the most common rating was a 3. 
Instructors
The survey also asked students to quantify how helpful or understanding their professors are when problems arise. To the former, 64% of students said “sometimes,” compared to 27% and 9% who said “yes” and “no” respectively. To the latter, 73% said “sometimes,” 21% “yes” and 7% “no.”
Students interviewed by the Daily Trojan after filling out the survey elaborated on the survey data and said that the quality of instructors varies significantly.
“How your semester goes really depends on who your professor is,” said Laura Pisciotte, a second year majoring in architecture.
Pisciotte said her professors have been sympathetic when it comes to illnesses that affect her ability to work. 
“Second semester last year, I got [coronavirus] halfway through the project,” Pisciotte said, “and [my professor] was understanding that I couldn’t do as much work [and] that I couldn’t be present.”
Manuel Bernardino Jr., a third-year student in the program, recalled particularly negative experiences with professors.
“I’ve had professors almost question who you are as a person, your ethics, what you’re doing with your time as if it’s their business in the first place,” Bernardino said. “I played sports my whole life. I get how a football coach might be [harsh]. But I don’t need my professor to be a football coach. I need my professor to guide me in the right direction and help me when I need it.”
Lucas Brown, a first year in the architecture program, said he confirmed in a meeting with Associate Professor and Undergraduate Programs Director Doris Sung that the only degree requirement to teach architecture is either a bachelor’s degree or a doctorate in architecture — meaning that no formal training in education is required by the National Architecture Accrediting Board to become an instructor. As a result teachers often have little to no actual teaching experience when entering academia.
Brown said that as a result there was “an inconsistency with the performance of each of the instructors” because of these requirements set to teach in the program. He said that while he personally was happy with his studio instructor last semester, there are others in the program who are not nearly as satisfying. 
“We have other instructors, this semester and last semester, who just are unable to communicate,” Brown said. “Even if they have the proper knowledge, they just can’t communicate it in an educational format.“It then becomes a dice roll of who’s going to be a good instructor and who’s not.” 
Financial strains
Students are asked to pay for the materials, such as glue and chipboard, and fabrication tools, such as laser cutting or 3D printing, they use to create their physical models, as well as the programs used to complete digital assignments, such as the Adobe Suite, which other schools such as Annenberg offer at no additional cost. 
“It was almost an expectation that we’d have to pay to use a 3D printer and laser cutting materials and tools that the school has,” said Jah-Mier’e Shelton, a first-year majoring in architecture.
The financial burden of the program is a common problem for architecture students. Roxanne Natal, a first-year in the program, said that while she has managed to avoid paying too much for model materials, she still wishes the issue were not so severe. 
“I would consider myself a low income student, so I always try to spend the least money I can on materials,” Natal said. “But, I don’t think, in the future, [doing that] would be the wisest choice … Inevitably, I’m probably going to have to suffer a little bit.” 
Funding for the School of Architecture was a particular issue raised by Bernardino, who spoke about how the costs of the architecture program are a significant burden on top of his expected cost of attendance. Still, he said he experiences doubt about what exactly students’ tuition is paying for within the program.
“I pay gas every three days to get here, then on top of that, I’m expected to spend close to $500 to $1,000 on models or pieces that, again, you spend so much time making,” Bernardino said. “Then [instructors will] just break it apart to help you see certain aspects of the project that you might not have seen.” 
Bernardino said that he often wonders how much of his tuition is spent by the University on the program, specifically citing the plain construction of the architecture building — “It’s depressing, it’s just a concrete block,” Bernardino said — and printers and fabrication machines that often break. 
“[It’s] ridiculous, for a school that charges this much money, that they don’t have their own supplies here available to the students,” he said. “If I knew my $70,000 would be going towards more innovative and inspiring spaces for everybody — not even just for me, but for future architecture students — hell yeah, go for it.” 
In a statement Wednesday to the Daily Trojan, the School of Architecture wrote that while it is unable to discern the amount of funding it receives from the University — as USC’s annual financial report “does not provide breakdowns of individual school budgets” — it nonetheless “has the support of the university to provide the resources needed to serve our students, faculty and staff.”
Workload and mental health
Survey respondents also had the opportunity to rate their workload in the program. On a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 was “way too light” and 5 was “way too heavy,” the average was a 4; 52% answered with this number and an additional 32% rated the workload a 5. 
In additional questions, 52.3% of respondents said that they were pushed to learn new materials and softwares at an unfair pace. Nearly 80% of respondents admitted to having ignored an illness to attend a class, and 77% said that they did so to complete a project.
Outside of class time, those surveyed said they continue to work long hours on architecture assignments, spending anywhere between two to 15 hours each day working on studio projects. Some said that they have occasionally spent longer than two consecutive days working on a project with no sleep, with one respondent saying that they once spent 96 continuous hours — or four straight days — on a project. 
Just over 60% of survey respondents said that the program had negatively impacted their mental health. About 16% percent said that it had not, and an additional 22.7% said that they were unsure.
Bernardino said the program has affected his mental health in ways that he had never experienced beforehand. 
“I’ve always been a very confident person in everything that I’ve done,” Bernardino said. “Sports, fashion, anything … until I came here, and [the program] destroys me all the time. I have so many second guesses about myself, who I am. Why am I here?” 
Just over half of the respondents said that they had at one point considered dropping out of the program. Those respondents’ reasons for not dropping out ranged from not having other majors that they would be interested in to telling themselves that the program’s stress was worthwhile. 
For some, the program becomes too much to bear. Karsyn Wendler, a junior majoring in civil engineering, said she switched her major from architecture to civil engineering this semester because the program was taking too great of a toll on her mental health.
“It was getting to a point with [the] studio [class] where I was so stressed out about it that, if it meant sacrificing extra sleep or a meal, I would if it meant I could sit at studio to work for another hour,” she said. 
Administration within the program has done little to change or listen to students, some students said. Bernardino told the Daily Trojan that Sung had spoken to students in his year and said that she never had to pull an all-nighter to complete work while studying architecture at Princeton and Columbia. 
About 86% of survey respondents said that they have pulled at least one all-nighter to complete a project, with some noting that they have done so anywhere between five and 50 times. 
Bernardino recounted having to drive home from the studio at 4 a.m. and almost falling asleep behind the wheel — “the scariest thing [he’s] ever experienced.” 
In another conversation that Wendler said her cohort had with Sung, administration reportedly brushed off student stress as a consequence of needing to meet NAAB requirements. Sung did not respond to requests to verify such a conversation had taken place.
“[In] spring of last year, we had a conversation with [Sung] about the workload and the stress it was putting on us,” Wendler said. “The faculty’s response was, ‘Well, we have to meet these requirements for NAAB … there’s no choice.’” 
The Daily Trojan reached out to Sung for comment on the allegations that she seemed to ignore student concerns and push blame for the program’s demands to the NAAB’s constraints. The Daily Trojan also asked Sung to comment on the survey’s data points that indicated students were suffering from stress.
“USC School of Architecture cares deeply about its students’ education, health and experiences,” wrote Sung in a statement Wednesday. “We want all our students to not only succeed but to thrive as they adapt to this unique education at a nationally ranked Architecture program. We are committed to listening to their concerns along the way and directly improving their experiences.”
Sung mentioned a continuing initiative called “Coffee Chats,” which aims to put younger students in contact with older ones. She also encouraged students to speak up to staff and faculty when problems arise. 
“This current semester, a cohort of students have highlighted certain challenges,” the statement continued. “We held listening sessions, convened forums, prepared surveys and pledge to continue to keep these lines of communication open. We hear our students and strive to provide equitable access to resources that support them.”
Solutions
A student majoring in architecture, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation from peers, said that the best way to create change was for students themselves to speak out. 
“When we band together as a class, when we use our student voice and our perspectives, a lot can happen and a lot can change,” the student said. “That has happened in the past and it’s happening now.” 
Pisciotte said that because she and her classmates spoke up to their professors last year, the program improved for them tremendously. 
“This year has been so much better,” she said. “Our midterms don’t overlap anymore [and] our finals don’t overlap anymore.” 
Students interviewed said that communication and openness from instructors was an area in need of improvement.
“It’s not supposed to be this weird, strict boundary between instructor and student,” Brown said. “The best thing that students and instructors can do is to just learn how to be more communicative with each other, not just between faculty and students, [but also] between faculty and faculty, just being able to be more clear of the expectations … so kids can pass while at the same time not risking their own mental and physical health.”
Natal said that a major problem that has stemmed from this communication issue is project planning, and that ideally instructors would learn from any mistakes made this semester and improve their planning strategies in the future. 
Students also discussed potential systemic changes: Brown said that hopefully the hiring of a new permanent dean for the School of Architecture — which is currently overseen by interim dean Willow Bay, concurrently the dean of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism — would enable some decisions to be made surrounding the school’s funding. Another such fixable issue, he said, would be a new grading system — such as “some kind of pass/fail system or a ‘B or above’-type grading system” — to take pressure off of students. 
“If the teachers aren’t gonna be able to communicate it then at least the grading system will define the fact that it is okay to not always do well, and if you don’t do well, that’s fine.” Brown said. “As long as you learn from the mistakes then it’s okay.”
Justin Kaczender, a third year and president of the undergraduate student council at the School of Architecture, noted that since the architecture school’s curriculum is based on the NAAB accreditation, there isn’t much that can be immediately fixed. He said that a more immediate solution would be for the University to deal with the program’s funding.
“All of our requirements as [architecture] students are based on the NAAB board, which is who gives the accreditation out so that we can get licensed after school,” Kaczender said. “A lot of the issues within our school are more related to access to materials and the proper facilities to do the work that we’re required to do.” 
Kaczender emphasized that a lot of responsibility for fixing these issues actually lies on USC as a whole. 
“Our tuition isn’t necessarily going directly to the School of Architecture. It’s going to the school as a whole,” Kaczender said. “It would be nice to just try to urge the school to help [with funding].” 
Those who have remained in the program, such as Bernardino, hope they will find that the experience was worth the strife it caused. 
“[My parents would say] ‘Everything hard in life is worth pushing through. Just stick through it, it’ll be worth it in the end.’” Bernardino said. “I guess we’ll see after my fifth year if it really was or not.”

USC baseball defeated the Seattle Redhawks by a score of 9-4 Wednesday night, marking its second straight victory and making the Trojans 6-1 over their last seven outings. The Trojans battled adversity in what became a frigid evening caused by unexpected rain, but were able to beat the Redhawks thanks to senior infielder Johnny Olmstead’s 3-run triple in the bottom of the seventh inning. 
Olmstead’s triple came at the right time, as USC had been struggling to get on the scoreboard again despite a quick 2-0 start in the first inning. From there, USC would go on to tack on 3 more runs, one of them coming in the remainder of the seventh inning while the other two came in the bottom of the eighth inning. 
Unlike previous seasons, the unfamiliar cold and rainy weather in Los Angeles has made field conditions tricky to figure out. Regardless, Head Coach Andy Stankiewicz said the weather is simply a part of the game.
“[The weather] is what it is,” said Stankiewicz in a postgame interview with the Daily Trojan. “When the umpire says ‘play ball,’ we just gotta go and so I think the guys have done a nice job of responding well to the elements.”
Although USC was standing at 5-7-1 after its first 13 games, it has recently gotten into a groove that started with back-to-back victories against No. 2 Stanford in a series earlier in March. The team’s winning ways continued when they traveled to Cal Poly a week ago and then this past weekend in their series against UC Berkeley, which they won 2-1. With their win Wednesday over Seattle, the Trojans are now 6-1 in their past seven games, bringing their overall record to 11-8-1. 
“We’ve got a long way to go,” Stankiewicz said. “But guys are feeling good about themselves… [and are] starting to gain some confidence and are understanding that it’s not necessarily about the opponents, it’s about playing good baseball. That’s what we preach.”
Although the Trojans came out on top and scored 2 runs early in the first inning, they still seemed to struggle in the middle game, where they scored just 1 run in innings 2 through 6. On the defensive side of the ball, however, USC has been especially successful, giving up an average of just under 4 runs a game over its last six games. The Trojans’ defensive capabilities have been the X factor in their recent success, and it needs to stay that way as the team continues to develop its ability to swing inside the strike zone.
“Part of the frustrations sometimes is that we can’t leave the [strike] zone,” Stankiewicz said. “Sometimes we get aggressive but the aggressiveness leads to swings out of the [strike] zone. It’s part of the game, it’s part of our development as an offense is doing a better job of getting a good pitch to hit.”
In Wednesday’s game against Seattle, USC played seven pitchers, allowing senior pitcher Blake Sodersten to rest for this coming weekend. Looking on to the weekend, as USC prepares to face Washington State in a three-game series at Dedeaux Field, Stankiewicz said that he is pleased with how his team is playing — especially some of the pitchers that played tonight. 
“[Senior pitcher] Kyle Wisch did a really good job, [redshirt senior pitcher] Garrett Clarke has been superb for us,” Stankiewicz said. “I’m just encouraged by the ways that guys are starting to understand their roles and what they’re supposed to do in that role and buy into that role.” 
USC’s next game is later tonight against Washington State at Dedeaux Field at 6:30 p.m.
