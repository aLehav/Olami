Undergraduate Student Government Program Board Finance and Administration Director Hahney Yo proposed several changes to USG administrative positions at the Senate meeting on Tuesday. 
Along with altering certain responsibilities for the president and the vice president, Yo also suggested eliminating several positions, a change that she said would increase efficiency and help improve project implementation.
“As a member who is leaving USC, I think that USG can be run more effectively,” Yo said. “And I think these changes can help us be more useful to the student body.”
The roles that Yo proposed changes for span multiple departments. Yo said that under her plan, the vice president would no longer be overseeing the advocacy branch. Instead, there would be a Senior Director of Advocacy in that role.
“The entire advocacy branch is changing,” Yo said. “We are now no longer going to have any assistant directors, [and instead] there will be eight directors who will all be directly working on projects.” 
Yo added that the Treasurer would handle all of the USG accounts, which is currently her role — essentially eliminating her position. Yo said that because it might be difficult for the new Treasurer to fulfill both the responsibilities of Treasurer and the responsibilities of Finance and Administration Director, she was also in the process of creating an Excel template for the new Treasurer to adhere to. 
Furthermore, Yo said that one of her additional goals for the internal USG position changes was to make communication between the various branches of USG more transparent and efficient. A problem Yo noted from her experience on USG was that there were multiple redundant positions for each responsibility, and as a result, projects would either be over-managed or completely neglected.
“A lot of the changes involve simply condensing the team because a lot of it contains associate directors and assistant directors, which is incredibly inefficient,” Yo said. “And to improve the executive branch’s communication with the students, the vice president will be organizing town halls. The president and vice president will also hold one-on-ones with executive officers to keep both channels open for communication.”
Yo emphasized that her proposal was still subject to change and that she was open to any and all suggestions or recommendations from other students and senators. 
Besides Yo’s proposal to change responsibilities and roles within USG, other members of other USG departments also presented their completed and upcoming projects for the 2016-2017 school year. Sen. Daniel Newman presented his plans for spring admit reform and for the smoke-free campus initiative, and Sen. Tyler Matheson noted resolutions he had created to improve date rape testing, sexual assault education, greek community wellness and the counseling center. 
“In terms of date rape drug testing, there isn’t a viable solution on campus currently, so over winter break I contacted a lab that could help us with this,” Matheson said. “This is essentially an outsourcing initiative that we can pay $140 for — which is currently a quarter of the current cost — and I’m hoping to see it go through by the end of this semester.”

A group of political and economic professionals debated the nation’s current economy Tuesday evening at Ground Zero Performance Café. 
The event, moderated by Unruh Institute Director Robert Shrum and USC Undergraduate Economics Association board member Aditi Jackson, introduced the audience to a broad view of opinions on the future of the U.S. economy under President Donald Trump’s leadership.
The USC Undergraduate Economics Association and the Unruh Institute hosted the discussion, which featured Orange County Register Opinion Editor Brian Calle, Klink Campaigns President Matt Klink and Los Angeles County Federation of Labor Director of Policy Kokayi Kwa Jitahidi.
Calle said that despite the social fear caused by Trump, some of his economic policies are logical. He told the panel and audience about a conversation he had with one of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s closest aides, where he expressed his economic views regarding the nation’s current stance.
“We need to focus on fixing Obamacare and tax cuts, and make the economic issues and healthcare issues forefront, and rebrand the Republican Party,” Calle said.
Jitahidi viewed Trump’s ideologies differently. He remarked that economic growth does not equate to more jobs, as it is due to increased globalization. He said that the economy of the United States relies on manufacturing, where there is wage theft, and that capital will maximize their profits. 
“We call this Reaganomics,” Jitahidi said. “History says that we are likely going to end up with a lot of debt because when you cut taxes, you cut revenue to the government.” 
Both Klink and Calle opposed this view. Klink stated that the Barack Obama economy did not promise economic growth and did not facilitate it, and that capitalists on Wall Street feed on lower taxes and decreased regulation. He then shifted the issue from capitalism to middle class Americans who voted for Trump because they sought economic healing. 
“The folks in the middle of the country, they are so desperate for anybody who can help them and neither party has been able to,” Klink said. “They will vote for anybody who appears to be that change. In 2008, Barack Obama was that change. In 2016, Hillary Clinton was a third term for Barack Obama, and people said this is not going to cut it.” 
On the issue of the possible reappeal of the Affordable Care Act, Klink stated that there would most likely be a reappeal before a replacement. He argued that most of the issues of Obamacare derived from the increase in the cost of other insurances due to the implementation of cheaper insurance for those under Obamacare. Meanwhile, Klink said that some people want to forget Obamacare and go toward single-payer insurance because it benefits them more. 
“What [Trump] may be doing is reinvigorating a progressive movement that will go beyond 2018,” Jitahidi said.

Coming off of its biggest win of the season, an 84-76 victory over then-No. 8 UCLA at the Galen Center, USC will be tasked with traveling up north to take on Washington (9-12,  2-7) Wednesday night. 
Entering the Alaska Airlines Arena for its contest against the Huskies, USC and Washington are two programs heading in completely opposite directions. 
The Huskies are entering Wednesday night’s matchup in the midst of a three-game losing skid. Washington’s most recent loss came on Sunday against No. 5 Arizona, 77-66. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the Trojans have won consecutive conference matchups and will enter their game against Washington just one week after topping a highly favored UCLA team at home. 
However, the Huskies do present a threat to USC. In Washington’s loss to Arizona this past weekend, freshman guard Markelle Fultz — one of the most touted players in the nation — finished with 16 points (8-of-23 shooting), nine rebounds and three assists. On Tuesday, Fultz was announced a finalist for the Bob Cousy Award, which is awarded to the top point guard in the country. Fultz is also on the midseason list for the Wooden Award, which is given annually to the top player in the nation. 
The leading scorer in the Pac-12, averaging 23.3 points per game (No. 6 nationally) this season, Fultz is the only player in the country to be averaging 20 points, six rebounds and six assists per game — and the Trojans are more than aware of the threat he poses.
“[Fultz] is a great player at all three levels. He can score the ball well and gets his teammates involved,” junior guard Jordan McLaughlin said. “We’ve been practicing on keying in on him and knowing where he is at all times defensively.” 
Washington currently sits
second-to-last in the Pac-12 standings, only ahead of an Oregon State team that is winless in conference play this season. However, eight of the Huskies’ nine total victories this season have come on their home floor at the Alaska Airlines Arena. Washington is 8-5 overall at home this season and 1-7 on the road. 
“We’ve just got to come in really prepared,” junior guard Elijah Stewart said. “We’ve got to make stops in transition, and make someone else on their team be an impact player.”
Stewart’s one-handed putback slam against UCLA was one of the biggest highlights in the Trojans’ victory over the Bruins last Wednesday. Stewart finished the contest against UCLA with 15 points and three steals. 
Another emerging threat for USC is redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron, who was named the Pac-12 Men’s Basketball Player of the Week on Monday for his 23-point effort off of the bench against the Bruins. In a career-best performance, Aaron shot 4-of-9 from beyond the arc to spur on the Trojans’ upset victory. 
“Big games, big stage, these are the types of games you want to perform well in,” Aaron said. 
Wednesday’s contest with Washington will mark the beginning of the end of conference play for USC; it has only nine Pac-12 games remaining on its schedule this season, including the tilt in Seattle. 
“[The Huskies] are scrappy, and they aren’t just going to let anyone walk in there and get a win,” McLaughlin said. “We’re just worried about focusing on the task at hand right now. Practicing, getting better, we just have tunnel vision right now.” 
After taking on Washington on the road, USC will remain in the state of Washington for its following contest against Washington State (11-10, 4-5) on Saturday.

Kirstin Louie | Daily TrojanMoving up the ranks · Sophomore Jessica Failla is one of three ranked singles players on USC. The Trojans will take on SDSU on Wednesday.
Coming off of a 1-1 split in the ITA Kick-Off Weekend, the No. 18 USC women’s tennis team prepares for its first two home matches of the year. Following a 4-2 win over Rice and a 4-1 loss to No. 15 Auburn last week, the Women of Troy host San Diego State on Wednesday and No. 1 Florida on Friday. Both matches are set for afternoon starts in Marks Stadium. 
With a 2-1 record, the Trojans have started the year off strong. USC boasts three ranked singles players: No. 46 sophomore Jessica Failla, No. 52 junior Madison Westby and No. 56 senior Zoë Katz.
The Trojans also have two ranked doubles teams, both of which feature Katz. The pairing of Katz and junior Gabby Smith are No. 18 in the country, while Katz and junior Madison Westby are tied for the No. 27 ranking. With a good amount of representation in the ITA rankings, USC has a talented squad that will look to challenge for the Pac-12 title. Coming off a solid 8-2 home record during the 2015-16 season, the Trojans will look to replicate their strong performances at Marks Stadium again. 
On a team with ranked talent, Smith is perhaps the player to watch most closely. While currently unranked, Smith is on an impressive eight-match winning streak that includes five ranked opponents. Smith’s streak will get put to the test once again when No. 1 Florida comes through Los Angeles this weekend. 
Coming to Marks Stadium with a 2-1 record on the season, the Aztecs will look to sneak out a win on the road. With only three matches under its belt, SDSU will be facing its highest-ranked opponent so far this season in USC.
The Aztecs do not feature any ranked singles or doubles players, but they have taken close victories over UC San Diego and UC Irvine to this point, with their sole loss coming against Cal State Fullerton. With a 43-4 all time record against SDSU, the Trojans look to continue their strong track record and gain some momentum going into their challenging matchup two days later. 
The No. 1 team in the nation, Florida, will roll through Los Angeles on Friday featuring one of the deepest teams in the country. The Gators are anchored by their five ranked singles players: No. 15 junior Josie Kuhlman, No. 24 senior Kourtney Keegan, No. 30 junior Anna Danilina, No. 37 senior Belinda Woolcock and No. 39 senior Spencer Liang.
Though Florida’s singles lineup alone equals the total number of ranked Trojans, the Gators also boast four ranked doubles teams, including the No. 7-ranked pair of Keegan and junior Brooke Austin. Three more top-25 pairs make up the rest of Florida’s doubles lineup: No. 12 Kuhlman/Woolcock, No. 21 Danilina/Liang and Keegan and junior Peggy Porter (No. 22). The highly touted Gators will be a big test for USC, but victories against a talented Florida team could go a long way when it comes to future rankings.
But before they set their eyes on toppling the top team in the country, the Trojans will first focus on dispatching San Diego State. Their match against the Aztecs begins at 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon, and they will take on Florida at the same time on Friday.

I used to think Steph Curry ruined basketball.
He was too much of a show-off. He sank those deep-ball 3-pointers that arced high enough to kiss the rafters of Oracle Arena before splashing without even skimming the rim. His touch was special enough or just downright lucky enough to ensure success for his Golden State Warriors, even when he was heaving it from half-court.
I knew he was good, in the same way that most of the football-loving population of America acknowledges Tom Brady’s skill while cursing him in the same breath. But I couldn’t stand the way he approached regular season games like a glorified All-Star Weekend Three-Point Contest with a few defenders scattered around the court. That wasn’t how to play basketball.
What I resented most was the effect he had on young players. Elementary school kids started spending hours jacking up 30-foot jumpers that fell short with monotonous certainty. That obsession somehow trickled into college and professional ball, with more players taking shots from behind the arc.
Curry can take full credit. He can also take credit for this season of NCAA play, which has seen a focus on guard-heavy offense that utilizes only one post in the paint and emphasizes a spread attack. 
When I first saw this style of play come to the forefront of all my favorite teams’ strategy, I hated it. But after the Trojans upset UCLA at the Galen Center last week, I came to realize that this new style of play — the Curry method, if you will — might be exactly what college basketball needs. 
I grew up watching the University of Kansas Jayhawks, back when they cycled through phenomenal big men like Cole Aldrich, the Morris twins and even Joel Embiid for a fleeting season. 
The post position is gritty, physical and aggressive. The footwork is subtle and every shot is contested. And post defense is more personal than defense in any other position of any other team sport: Players on both sides spend the majority of the game jamming elbows into each other’s guts and slapping at arms, shoulders and loose balls. 
For all these reasons, it was my favorite position to play and to watch.
Kansas always brought the heat in the paint. The team was centered around a corps of big men trained by former NCAA powerhouse Danny Manning to demolish the rim with rote proficiency: The Jayhawks’ posts were bigger, stronger and just plain meaner than their competition. They provided the muscle down low necessary to pull out Big 12 championships with an almost stupefying consistency. 
As a young Kansas fan, I had my first encounter with Curry. He was a scrawny junior from Davidson College, his uniform practically falling off his wiry shoulders, and he was dead set on knocking the Jayhawks out of the Elite Eight, one wild jump shot after another.
Despite being an undeniably better team than Davidson, the Jayhawks barely squeaked out a 59-57 victory. But Curry’s 25 points almost pulled his underdog team into the Final Four.
How’d he do it? Curry, true to form, took 16 attempts from behind the arc, more than the entire Kansas team attempted. The Jayhawks scrambled to cover his 3-point heroics, and though the team continued on to the national championship, the near-loss exposed a defensive weakness.
The main effectiveness of the 3-point shot is its ability to spread a defense. A traditional offense allows for posts to guard more tightly in the paint, with wing players remaining as options to double team or to jump into a passing lane. With those wing defenders stretched out to the arc to guard shooters more tightly, the middle of the court is left wide open for guards to drive or pass into their big men.
This is simple basketball logic, the type that’s been discussed for decades. But for a long time, most coaches still stuck to the dogma that 3-pointers can’t be the backbone of any offense. Curry, Klay Thompson and the Warriors’ 2015 championship rings politely disagreed.
Ultimately, the shift towards a guard-heavy, widely-spread offense wasn’t gradual. It happened over a handful of seasons, enough that I was able to rapidly notice — and bemoan — the change. But then USC took down No. 8 UCLA in dominant fashion after dropping 14 3-pointers, and I began to realize what this change can do for the sport of basketball.
The 3-pointer is the ultimate equalizer. It’s the shot that can turn an undersized guard into a team’s golden boy. It sets defenses on their heels and brings stadiums to their feet. And it’s a challenge that’s inherently more difficult to guard.
The shift to small ball changes the game. It allows lesser teams to attack with ferocity. It creates space, allows offenses to breathe and demands creativity for both sides of the ball. And no, it’s not the same brutal grind that high-key post play offers. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
This crafty style of play is evening the playing field for lower-ranked teams like USC, who just need a few minutes of opportunity to break ahead. It keeps teams from being shut down by a few dominant players down low and forces teams to play better defenses. And ultimately, the switch provides high-octane, high-scoring contests that keep the game from ever being predictable for its fans — and they can thank Steph for that.

Situated inside the Silversun Plaza on trendy Sunset Boulevard, Silverlake Ramen offers inexpensive Japanese cuisine to tourists and regulars wandering throughout the city. Unlike the quaint cafes and quirky hipster shops lining the streets of the neighborhood, Silverlake Ramen boasts a modest appearance that fits within the aesthetic of this corner strip mall. 
Much of the seating in the restaurant is limited to a couple of booths and single tables. The employees are constantly pulling apart and pushing together tables to accommodate parties of more than two people. 
To alleviate some of the cramped space within the restaurant, customers can be seated at the six-stool bar facing the open kitchen. Large windows covered with charming bamboo shades line the left side of the building, allowing the sunlight to cast a soft glow inside the building. Adding to the interior’s character were small wooden fans lining the ceiling, which provides patrons with a temperate and cool atmosphere.
The single paper menu narrows down the options for customers, preventing them from being overwhelmed by myriad choices. In addition to the daily menu, Silverlake Ramen offers a late night menu from 11:30 p.m. to 1:45 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. The late night menu offers a shortened version of the regular menu, with only ramen, snacks and drinks served. 
Though the streamlined options make it easier for the customer to order, the ramen section of the menu is slightly disappointing, offering only five types to choose from. These choices included a healthy vegetable ramen and a savory shoyu ramen including chicken broth and bamboo shoots. There is also a variety of toppings that customers can select, including corn, black garlic oil and egg.
Most regulars and tourists, however, come to Silverlake Ramen to try their renowned tonkatsu ramen. The presentation of the ramen bowls is impressive. The servings include enough food to satisfy a single starving person or two moderately hungry people. The pork broth is rich and savory, with the flavors exploding at the first sip. The pork belly is served over the noodles and green onions, which were neatly glazed on the edges. The pork slices melted in the mouth and provided the perfect amount of saltiness. 
The fresh green onions and bean sprouts added a crunchiness that complements the smoothness of the noodles. It is worth noting that this dish is extremely filling, with many customers taking to-go bowls home. For $9, it is a deal that cannot be missed, a testimony to the visitors who flock to Silverlake Ramen on a daily basis. 
The restaurant also offers small and regular bowls ranging from $6 to $10. The spicy tuna bowl and salmon poke bowl are both crowd favorites. With a peak price of $10, the bowls are slightly expensive for the small amount that is given in the regular bowl, with the toppings only including avocado and pickled ginger.        
Hand or cut rolls are available for order at around $4 and $8. One of Silverlake Ramen’s more interesting rolls include the lemon roll, a roll of fried shrimp inside spicy tuna with lemon slices on top. At $10, this is one of the more expensive rolls on the menu.
Silverlake Ramen is located at 2927 W. Sunset Blvd. It is open Sunday through Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. and until 1:45 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.
It’s spelled tonkotsu, not tonkatsu. First thing to know when writing about ramen.

Daniel Caesar, a 21-year-old singer-songwriter, enchanted an intimate audience Monday night at The Observatory in Santa Ana.
Caesar, an impeccable vocalist, started singing at a young age and uses narratives in his personal life to create eloquent lyrics about love, loss, faith and fortitude. He does not label his music under one genre, but rather takes inspiration from R&B, soul, rock and gospel.
At The Observatory, the crowd of about 150 people roared as he arrived on stage, surrounded by bright white lights flooding the floor. With a guitar in his hand, he began singing “Violet,” a song from his album Pilgrim’s Paradise, which was released in 2015.
Caesar’s performance of “Japanese Denim,” one of his most popular songs had the crowd singing along to the lyrics, “My blue jeans will last me all my life, so should we / I’m spending all this time,” followed by a grand crescendo over, “You don’t even know me, I’m hanging from a tree.” The intimacy of the venue allowed for only a limited number of Caesar fans to enjoy the show, which was apparent in the number of people in the audience singing along to every song.
Though he was never classically trained in vocals, Caesar’s falsetto and harmonies were immaculate, allowing audiences to hear the depth in his lyrics.
Growing up attending church with his family, Caesar was outspoken in his loss of faith in “Death and Taxes,” with lyrics such as, “Surely my sins have found me out, God rest my soul, but show me out / I live in a real world, I’ve lost my faith.” During the performance, Caesar pulled out his guitar as the white spotlight shined on him and confidently sang, “Only two things in this life that are sure, of that I’m sure, death and taxes.” Caesar’s upbeat number, “Paradise,” shared similar themes, as the audience danced and sang along: “Picking fights with my pops, he asked forgiveness a lot / But I don’t need God’s forgiveness, can I get me a witness.”
He ended the concert with his most popular song  “Get You.” This song speaks about being grateful for true love: “Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling. None of that could ever make me leave / Every time I look into your eyes I see it, you’re all I need.” 
Though Caesar has been producing successful music for years, he has recently risen to international recognition, touring for the first time in the United States in November 2016. His concert in Santa Ana was his last in January, following a sold-out concert in Los Angeles earlier that week.

It is oddly coincidental that President Donald Trump’s ban against immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries took place on the same weekend as the Screen Actors Guild Awards, bringing on the full wrath of Hollywood on Sunday night. Those present at the ceremony condemned the ban in their own ways. One of my favorite protests was from Jocelyn Towne, who proudly displayed the words “Let them in” on her chest above her dress’ feathery white neckline.
 And of course, there were the speeches. Condemnation of Trump came from every corner of the room and almost every award-winner. Notably, actress Emma Stone  — no doubt feeling pressure from her fellow speech-givers — pitched in.
 “We’re in a really tricky time in our world, in our country, and things are very inexcusable and scary and need action, and I’m so grateful to be part of a group of people that cares, and that wants to reflect things back to society,” Stone said.
 It was this one that made me think a little. Because if people can recall, Stone was also the same actress who portrayed a woman named Allison Ng in Cameron Crowe’s 2015 film Aloha. Allison was meant to be biracial (Stone is not), and this case was one of a collection of recent controversies about the practice of whitewashing in Hollywood.
 In the same league as Scarlett Johansson and Tilda Swinton, who played characters who were Asian in their films’ source material (Ghost in the Shell and Doctor Strange, respectively), Stone’s casting as Ng was an affront to Asian American actors everywhere. It doesn’t matter her level of chemistry with Bradley Cooper or even how perfectly she fit the role. What matters is that the character was written for a woman of color, and Stone took that part away.
 The speech that brought down the house on Sunday night was given by David Harbour on behalf of Stranger Things, a show with a predominantly white cast. “We 1983 Midwesterners will repel bullies,” Harbour roared to the crowd’s approval. “We will shelter freaks and outcasts, those who have no home. We will get past the lies. We will hunt monsters.” Don’t get me wrong — I love a good, boiling, angry speech. I will be the first one to stand up and applaud a speech like that. But I couldn’t help struggling to make sense of Harbour’s choice of words, leaving me as confused as Winona Ryder looked. Simply, where was Harbour’s solution to all this?
 Show me a direct connection between watching 1983 Midwesterners cut down supernatural monsters and Americans learning to accept and welcome marginalized people in their country. Don’t tell me that you are leading the stampede for progress when the “freaks and outcasts” you protect are predominantly white, a group that has never had to worry about the industry not being their home.
 In the same vein of celebrities taking up protest, pop duo and brothers Alex and Nat Wolff sent out a tweet last Sunday applauding the protestors at John F. Kennedy International Airport, right after tweeting a promotion for the film Patriot’s Day. Alex Wolff plays Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the retelling of the Boston Marathon bombing, a release that now seems poorly timed given Trump’s obsession with stirring up fear of foreign-born terrorists.
 First, I’m not sure why the world needs to watch a fictional version of an American tragedy that stars Mark Wahlberg as the hero and further alienates Muslims in America. But for Wolff to fail to realize this and tweet out support for those protesting the Muslim ban demonstrates a disturbing cognitive dissonance that seems to permeate Hollywood across the board.
 Yes, it’s a powerful thing beloved and talented people use their publicity as a platform for defending human rights and condemning federal corruption. But if it ends there, we are doomed. You can talk about equality and cut a check to the American Civil Liberties Union. You can do as Meryl Streep said and support the Hollywood Foreign Press. However, if this is the year that artists choose to become political, then it ultimately follows that their art becomes political as well. You cannot have only one, because it then becomes hypocrisy.
 So when celebrities get onstage and want to talk about equality, I’m here to listen. I’m waiting in the audience with an open heart and so much hope that it hurts. But I don’t like being appeased, and I don’t like being lied to. Because the thing about being a white actor in Hollywood is that you only need to make speeches when discrimination is thrust in your face, when the country is so clearly descending into ignorance. But when the injustice of Trump’s presidency passes, what will be left? What will have changed?
 On the night of the SAG Awards, this is what I heard: Support the marginalized, donate to the marginalized and defend the marginalized. But where are the marginalized on our movie screens? Where are the marginalized in this reflection of society? Where are the Asian Americans, the Latino Americans, the Muslim Americans, the Native Americans, members of the LGBT community and women who have character development outside of wanting a man? If you don’t pour the rage inside of you into your art, a mouthpiece that you know impacts and entrances millions, then what is all this talk for anyway?
 No. Not acceptable. Hollywood, I’m calling you out. Look at how much power you have. Look at how many listen when you speak. Point at the evil and ignorant, but that won’t make it go away. I applaud your speeches, and I forgive your transgressions. I continue to dream of joining your ranks, but hold yourself accountable to your words. Now is the time to deliver.

This week, California moved to clear the Yes California Independence Campaign, allowing the movement’s supporters to begin collecting signatures to appear on California’s 2018 ballot. The initiative, which would require the collection of over 585,000 signatures by July 25, is designed to remove the clauses of the California Constitution which identify the state an “inseparable part” of the United States and make the U.S. Constitution the “supreme law of the land.” It also requires a vote on independence to take place in 2019, where California voters will determine if the state should form an independent country. Evidently, in the wake of Republican dominance in the U.S. government, some Californians believe that our place ought to be outside of America. However, precisely because of the losses that American progressivism has faced in recent months, California’s presence in the union is even more critical. Californians must spearhead the opposition to unwise federal government policies and rights violations, not abandon the role of progressive national leadership.
Around the world, there has been a surge in national sentiment, and it is clear that even California is no exception. Yet, Californians should be wary of embracing such a passionate perspective. The progressive ideals that most Californians agree on are threatened by an excessive pride that borders on narcissism. Politically speaking, California contributes immensely to the ethnic and ideological diversity of the United States. Without it, Republicans would net 24 more seats in the House of Representatives, and Democrats would lose two of the most powerful and outspoken senators. Culturally, the state would surely continue to be influential in America and the world, but it would do so regardless of the Yes California Independence Campaign’s success or failure. California and America both have a lot to lose and very little to gain from Californian independence.
Rather than explore the topic of secession, though, we should turn our attention to the factors that gave rise to such a movement — small as it is. California is massive, diverse and wealthy. In these and in many other ways, it dwarfs its neighbor states and even many countries. This might give Californians a sense of inflated ego; but pride goes before a fall, as the idiom goes. 
California is in many ways unique and special, but it is not exceptional. It is a member of the United States, and as long as the state remains in the union, national priorities must come first. Organized opposition to controversial federal policies and actions, such as the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the executive order pertaining to immigration bans and denying sanctuary cities funding all reach their pinnacle in the Golden State. California is the breeding ground for liberal thought in the United States, and though a little introspection never hurt anyone, if Californians become too absorbed in themselves, it can only lead to calamity.
Instead of becoming disillusioned with the direction the United States is going and holding ourselves up on a contrarian pedestal, Californians ought to be proactive in steering the ship of state. We have a huge voice, and we need to use it to advance the causes we care most about throughout the nation, not only in our own backyard. Although state and local elections are immensely important, they are no substitute for doing what California does best — morphing the nation’s definition of “business as usual.” From slang to cuisine, California has immense influence. Just because things didn’t go our way once doesn’t mean we can’t change it for the better next time — history shows that, in fact, we can.
Neglecting California’s place as a bastion of American liberalism will only hurt progressive causes nationwide. Abandoning California’s statehood would be infinitely worse. If Californians are serious about issues like reproductive rights, protecting the LGBT community and maintaining the environment, then we need to confront the opposition. We cannot afford to slink away with our tails between our legs and barricade ourselves where we feel comfortable.

California residents take pride in their cities and states out of a mix of disgust over national affairs. They are proud of California’s response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders. The state fights against legislation that would withhold funding from sanctuary cities. Identifying less with national pride and more with state and local pride could help spark more local engagement and activism, which would benefit California as a whole. 
This state pride is clearly demonstrated through the Yes California Independence Campaign, which advocates for Californian independence from the United States. The campaign recently received permission to begin gathering signatures to get the initiative on the 2018 ballot. The Yes California campaign has been around for a few years, but gained momentum after this year’s presidential election — and rightfully so. Californians are realizing that our nation’s leadership doesn’t match their values, causing them to identify more strongly with their state than their country. 
Of course, a full-on secession would not be realistic or desirable. Becoming a country would be a logistical nightmare, and even if the initiative passed, it might not be in time to escape a Trump presidency. Under the current plans, California residents would vote for their independence in the spring of 2019. By the time residents vote on their independence, we could possibly have a new president, since Trump’s term ends in 2020. 
Whether or not Californians want to vote for their independence, they are stuck in the United States of America, at least for most of Trump’s first term. Applying the same California pride that drove calls for secession to a heightened interest in local issues would allow the state to make the most of a bad situation. Secession isn’t the best option for California, but the idea of increased state pride is on the right track.
While secession is an extreme example of state pride, the frustration of those who buy into Calexit is understandable. Trump lost California by over 4 million votes. Millions of Californians did not vote for — and do not agree with — our current administration. This ideological difference is reflected throughout the state’s strong commitment to attacking climate change and defending undocumented immigrants, even as Trump signs executive orders against these very acts.
The heightened interest in Calexit points to a larger trend: Californians are frustrated and want to take action. However, if California residents are so turned off by national politics, they can increase their involvement in local and state politics instead. Voter turnout in L.A. city elections is notoriously low; residents can directly influence policies taking shape around them by pouring their heightened local pride into local elections. 
Maybe California does need to focus on itself for a while — but it can do this while remaining a state. For individuals, this means grassroots campaigning, getting involved with local government and volunteering with nonprofits. California can spend the next four years improving from within, setting an example for other states. 
In Gov. Jerry Brown’s State of the State Address, he noted that California often serves as a model for the nation. We can spend the next four years doing what we can to perfect this model, and hopefully, by the next administration, other states and national leaders will be willing to give our model a try. 
While secession and successive formation of California the country may be an extreme act of state pride, these same feelings can be harnessed to affect positive change, such as increased civic engagement. That would certainly be a win for all residents of the state — or future nation — of California.

If the use of “Californian pride” means pushing the state to enact more of the same liberal policies that have put us where we are now, then California will become a worse place than it already is.

The Undergraduate Student Government Elections Commission administered two strikes to Austin Dunn and Morgan Monahan’s presidential campaign after the other two tickets filed complaints, according to transcripts from elections hearings released Tuesday. 
The verdict from the hearings, which took place Sunday, stated that the Elections Commission unanimously banned the campaign from posting on social media for a 48-hour period. The social media ban, according to the Elections Commission, includes but is not limited to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram posts by the candidates and their team on their personal accounts. The sanctions became effective Monday at 12:01 a.m. and remained in effect until 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. Furthermore, the two strikes will count toward a nine-strike limit, at which point the ticket would be disqualified, according to the USG Elections Code.
Dunn, a junior majoring in political science and pursuing a master’s in public diplomacy, and Monahan, a junior majoring in business administration, announced their candidacy for president and vice president, respectively, on Jan. 26 at 7 p.m. However, the other two tickets — consisting of Rachel Udabe and running mate Rebecca Harbeck and current USG Senator Daniel Million and running mate Timothy Vorhoff — alleged in complaints filed with the USG Elections Commission on Jan. 27 that Dunn and Monahan had begun their campaigning the day before what was allowed, on Jan. 25 at approximately 11:00 a.m.
In one hearing, Udabe and Harbeck asked the four deciding commissioners to disqualify Monahan and Dunn on the basis that they had broken election codes by creating a Facebook group and inviting several hundred members before the start of the official campaign period. Udabe and Harbeck argued that this put the other two tickets at a disadvantage. 
“If they are not disqualified, there is no reason for candidates in the future to not engage in this type of problematic behavior,” Harbeck said at the hearing, according to the transcript. “If you can gain a clear advantage in the beginning without fear of actual punishment to advance your ends, why would other people not do this as well?”
Million and Vorhoff, whose complaint was addressed in the other hearing on Sunday, said that several people invited to join were current members of USG who should not have been involved based on their positions. Furthermore, they added that having a group formed 32 hours before the official start of the campaign period gave Dunn and Monahan’s campaign a strong base of supporters a full day in advance. 
“Just based on having over a hundred people added to a secret group, don’t you feel like that would also affect just having people knowledgeable about the election a day ahead of time, don’t you think they could have spread the word to their friends?” Million said at the hearing. “Just having a hundred people, of course they would probably talk to an additional person or two additional people.” 
Monahan and Dunn agreed that they had set up the Facebook group on Jan. 25, but stated that initially, they only invited a core group of people who were involved with their campaign to take part in it. However, these people then invited others, which led to the group having over 300 members by Jan. 26, according to the transcript from the hearing. 
“This was in no way meant to be a malicious act against the other two tickets,” Monahan said, according to the hearing transcripts. “It was honestly just because we were excited. We’ve been planning this since October.” 
However, Dunn added that he believed his team was not the only one to have broken campaign rules.
“We have specific cases from both teams about how they actually announced the campaign before we even did, so we thought that it would be in our best favor if we just slid everything under the rug because we’re all kind of responsible for that,” Dunn said at the hearing, according to the transcript. “And we thought it would kind of be best to move forward from that and have a very clean campaign, but other teams may not have felt that way.”
The three campaign tickets were not allowed to comment on the situation, and the Elections Commission also declined to comment.
