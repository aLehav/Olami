CORRECTION – Thursday, Feb. 16, 4:27 p.m. PSTThe original version of this piece incorrectly asserted that candidates Divya Jakatdar and Michelle Lu had failed to respond to the Editorial Board’s question regarding sustainability, writing “the Jakatdar-Lu ticket did not address sustainability in any fashion — off-putting, since our interviews included a question directly about the subject.” In fact, though the Board intended to ask each ticket the same set of questions, it mistakenly neglected to ask the Jakatdar-Lu ticket its question about sustainability. Since publication, Jakatdar indicated to the Editor-in-Chief that she and Lu would have discussed sustainability had they been asked to or had their interview not overrun the Board’s allotted time. Though this correction does not change the Board’s endorsement decision, voters should be made aware of this mistake, and should refer to the ticket’s complete platform on the USG website for more information. The editorial staff sincerely regrets this error.
Responsible for representing the student body’s opinions and bridging the gap between students and administration, the role of Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president is no small job. 
Last election, the Daily Trojan broke tradition by choosing not to endorse a USG presidential and vice presidential ticket. The Spring 2022 Editorial Board — a diverse, sequestered panel of Daily Trojan staffers and editors not affiliated with the paper’s impartial news coverage — wrote that, after interviewing each candidate, they found none able to offer concrete plans toward improvement. 
This year, the Spring 2023 Daily Trojan Editorial Board was satisfied to find a ticket that would represent not only the core values of the student body, but also the desire to improve how USG functions internally. For these reasons, the Editorial Board has decided to endorse presidential candidate Aidan Feighery and vice presidential candidate Ashley Ka.
Candidates’ Perspectives & Platforms
In separate interviews with the Daily Trojan Editorial Board, the five executive tickets shared their perspectives on the responsibilities of their roles and explained their platforms in greater detail. The candidates — Miko Mariscal and Andrew Taw, Devin Ayala and Navya Singh, Aidan Feighery and Ashley Ka, Yoav Gillath and Monica Rodriguez and Divya Jakatdar and Michelle Lu — all seemed to acknowledge USG’s institutional flaws and inconsistent relationship with the student body. However, some responses were more lackluster than others.
The Mariscal-Taw ticket was the first to be interviewed. Before being asked, the ticket addressed the Editorial Board’s concerns regarding the USG budget. Taw questioned the challenges that come with accessing resources, emphasizing the ticket’s desire to “eliminat[e] all of that yellow tape surrounding how to access [funds].” With Mariscal and Taw both expressing a strong passion for community outreach and holding a variety of roles within campus organizations, the ticket was a strong contender for our endorsement. 
Mariscal, a South Los Angeles native, described the impact USC had on her community; teaching assistants, she noted, would visit her schools and provide her the opportunity to tour universities across California. Mariscal and Taw explicitly showed their care for the Trojan community as well as the surrounding South L.A. area, but the Editorial Board was left unsatisfied with the scope of their proposals. Beyond “support, support, support,” what did the ticket possess that pre-existing RSOs aren’t already providing? Shouldn’t the role of USG president and vice president be about more than just support?
The Ayala-Singh ticket spoke on initiatives that stemmed from their motto of “Equity, Transparency, Advocacy” — or ETA. But despite being able to consolidate their platform into an acronym, their platform can only be described as unfocused and incomplete. Many of the main goals for their campaign were restoring old initiatives such as a 24-hour Starbucks, or suggesting projects that already exist on campus — such as an LAX shuttle — rather than creating new ones.
Out of the five tickets, Feighery and Ka possessed the most realistic, rational and believable platform. Many of their proposed policies, were they elected, seem feasible and would have measurable outcomes. Their communication in explaining their thought process was also clear and concise: “We also think that USG should really be a body that reaches out actively to different RSOs to actively get student feedback,” Ka said. “Rather than being a system where RSOs have to go to USG to apply for funding, we want to implement a more effective RSO outreach program.” 
The duo’s chemistry and sincerity throughout the interview stood out among the five tickets, catching the Editorial Board’s attention and giving the Board a bit more optimism that policies would truly be carried out.
Gillath and Rodriguez felt that they were most equipped to bring back the single-rider Fryft system, and also wanted to expand Fryft into new areas like Koreatown and DTLA. While it was a nice gesture, and one that many would enjoy, it doesn’t seem feasible. In contrast, the Jakatdar-Lu ticket claimed that they are the only presidential ballot to have worked on reverting back to the single-ride model for Fryft. 
The two tickets, while seemingly having so much to say regarding their policies, often failed to directly answer the Board’s questions. They lacked the ability to explain — and critique — structures and processes within USG, and instead seemed more interested in providing promises of expensive projects like fingerprint ID cards and medical vending machines (ideas of the Jakatdar-Lu ticket) or performative initiatives such as giving sunscreen out to those at Skid Row (an idea of the Gillath-Rodriguez ticket). 
Student Outreach & Community 
A primary focus of Feighery and Ka’s campaign was the prevention of sexual assault in the USC community. In the wake of several fraternities choosing to disaffiliate from the University this year, Feighery and Ka want to implement more extensive affirmative consent training modules as a part of freshman orientation and better amplify Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention trainings as a resource for all organizations that throw large social gatherings. 
The pair admitted their limited power in reversing the University’s move to a shared Lyft model, which had been a single-ride system over the pandemic until the beginning of this semester. To improve the current program, which has seen many users experience delays in rides, the duo aims to propose a $150 credit to be distributed to users for single rides to complement the unlimited shared rides that the University offers. 
In an effort to reach out to the student body, Feighery and Ka propose to reform USG culture so that there is more open communication between USG and the student body. The ticket also wants USG to actively reach out to different RSOs to collaborate in getting feedback from students since they are more likely to voice concerns to their respective RSOs. The ticket believes that by working in good faith, they can promote a more inclusive USC community.
Sustainability
As an editorial board, we believe that USG’s decision to dismantle the Green Engagement Fund was a grave error. Our endorsement for Feighery and Ka reflects much on Feighery’s dissenting position and accompanying statement condemning the broken system that disallowed senators to garner enough information to be able to take action on such an impactful change. Mariscal and Taw, the only ticket without a senatorial background, also expressed their ability to speak on the intersectionality of the matter. While they acknowledged the subject, the Ayala-Singh and Gillath-Rodriguez tickets left room for growth in their responses.
Working within a broken system
We believe that USG lacks transparency in maintaining the Legislative Branch Project Tracker listed on their website. For example, if a project is incomplete, students deserve a meaningful explanation as to why. More details should be provided in order to create a process in which students — involved in USG or not — can engage with projects. 
Regarding budgeting, we ask for more transparency during the process of RSOs completing funding requests. We believe Feighery and Ka will do their best to ensure funding becomes more transparent and dispersed equitably. 
USG should maintain more awareness of the vast breadth of USC’s student body; not every student can allocate extra time to engage with USG. In addition to weekly office hours, USG should create internal structures which encourage — and perhaps require — representatives to check in with different communities. But this only works if representatives actually show up for students. The responsibility lies upon USG leaders to reach out, not the students themselves. No group on campus should be left in the dark.
With Ka bringing an outside perspective, this Editorial Board hopes that the attitude in USG will shift, as new input will be available from a candidate not shaped by previous semesters as an official.
Call to action
Among all five candidates campaigning for the election, it was made evident that there is a unanimous desire to reform the way USG serves the student body, and every ticket discussed a major restructuring in the way the organization approaches making change. Candidates spoke of hostile working environments within the organization that has corrupted its focus on serving the student body at large. The Daily Trojan hopes the coming administration will remember their role within the University and not let interpersonal relationships derail efforts in creating meaningful change. 
A lack of efficiency and effectiveness has remained an issue within the organization, and we hope students consider a candidate with clear, outlined goals that are attainable and realistic. We understand that USG has limited power over University action, but their hefty stipend suggests they should be getting more work done. We believe that the Feighery and Ka ticket outlines an appropriate amount of attainable goals for their prospective term. 
While our endorsement was decided upon after extensive research and interviews with each of the candidates, we urge the student body to conduct their own research and critically analyze each candidate’s platforms. This endorsement was decided upon prior to the USG election debate at 7 p.m. Thursday (tonight, at the date of publication), to which we urge students to closely pay attention in their decision-making process. 
The Daily Trojan pledges to hold whoever is elected accountable for campus-wide problems and any shortcomings upon which they seek to improve — and those they create themselves. We are only aware of each candidate’s executive aspirations; it will be up to those elected to prove themselves through actions, decisions and behaviors that are worthy of the appointment.
The Spring 2023 Daily Trojan Editorial Board — composed of three managing editors, three senior editors and three staff writers, all of whom represent various identities, disciplines and years at USC — conducted interviews with each of the five executive tickets. Members of the Editorial Board did not participate in any news-related coverage of the USG election cycle, nor are directly involved in the Spring 2023 news section’s impartial coverage. The Editorial Board framed each interview around the same questionnaire composed of questions on timely topics at USC, with follow-up questions allowed afterward.

It is election season for USC’s Undergraduate Student Government’s 143rd cabinet, meaning President Hannah Woodworth and Vice President Nivea Krishnan have about one more month in their sitting terms of office.
The Daily Trojan interviewed Woodworth on the accomplishments, deficiencies and modifications surrounding the USC community, as well as what she hopes for the incoming cabinet. 
Woodworth and Krishnan were sworn in on April 5, along with the rest of the cabinet. For Woodworth, one of the main accomplishments of her term was the release of SCÜP — USC’s shuttle to LAX. It helped many students get to see their loved ones without spending money out of pocket for Lyfts and other transportation services. 
“It is both an affordability initiative and sustainability initiative,” Woodworth said. “It’s an affordability initiative because it allows students who may not have been able to travel because even the cost from Point A to point B — USC to LAX — was a barrier to entry.” 
The data reigns true: About 4,000 students used the shuttle not just for winter break, but the shorter breaks, including fall and Thanksgiving recess. 
“It became an equity issue because some students had opportunities to go travel during breaks … and other students, because of the cost, weren’t able to and we wanted to eliminate that,” Woodworth said.  
With shuttle times ranging from five in the morning to later at night, the USC-LAX shuttle became a success for multiple students. Presented by USG senator Carlo di Bernardo last year, the program highlighted not only the scope of affordability on campus but the scope of sustainability in the greater Los Angeles area. 
“It’s a sustainability initiative because it’ll limit how many single-ride vehicles would be going to and from LAX,” Woodworth said. 
Although it is not entirely certain that the new shuttle will run during the 143rd cabinet’s term, Woodworth said that this year’s use of it was a test run of sorts to see how students would use it. 
“Since this was a pilot program, we need to analyze the data and see how well it was utilized throughout this year … for this whole year, our goal going into this year was to capture 25% of demand by the end of the year, which is about 9,000 students,” Woodworth said. “We are still very encouraged by the fact that we’ve had 4,000 students use it, especially within the first semester because we’re just getting it off the ground.”
Additionally, Woodworth and Krishnan hosted qualitative interviews, the first of their kind at USG.  There have been different views of USG throughout different clubs and registered student organizations, but Woodworth and Krishnan emphasized transparency during their campaigns — that is, a better connection between student organizations and the undergraduate student government of USC. 
Over this term, Woodworth and Krishnan met with 20 student leaders to better understand their concerns and what USG could do for them. This data helped Woodworth and Krishnan understand how other organizations of USC see USG, and what role these organizations believe USG carries. Most importantly, Woodworth and Krishnan examined the concerns of USC’s student organizations and how they believe they can improve with the help of USG and higher faculty. In turn, Woodworth and the cabinet are compiling all of this data to help the next administration. 
“What we’re doing is we’re taking all of this data [from the 20 student leaders and their organizations] and creating a qualitative report, and we’re creating a series of recommendations, so that the incoming administration does not have to go through the same really brutal transition that we did,” Woodworth said. 
Woodworth said this information helped their administration identify the faults and weak spots within USG as an organization. 
“We didn’t understand [USG’s] blindspots, we didn’t know why people didn’t trust [the organization]. Now, we’ve done a lot of the legwork to ensure that the next administration can just come in and implement these policies to better identify our blind spots to reach out to [registered student organizations] and better connect with students.” 
It was also Woodworth and Nivea’s cabinet that recently approved the name change of the Latine Student Assembly in January. 
Shortly before the fall semester began, the University Park Inter-Fraternity Council (now known as the unofficial IFC) decided to part ways with USC. This disaffiliation stemmed from the disagreements between University policies to ensure safety and ordinance for all USC students, including fraternity organizations themselves. The concern for the safety of USC students — specifically Panhellenic sorority women — when it comes to IFC fraternities and sexual assault were brought to the forefront of discourse after the protests following sexual assault allegations at Sigma Nu in Fall 2021. The IFC chapters disaffiliation from the University completely raised concern throughout the undergraduate community. Woodworth said USG has been trying to ensure student safety through Title IX and the like, as well as appointing Mia Albright as the Title IX Aid of USG. 
“[Albright] is doing a lot of work in campaigns, specifically around educating first-year students about their resources, women, and women identifying students about their different resources on campus and waste to support other folks on campus,” Woodworth said. 
Woodworth said that the disaffiliation makes it extremely difficult to work with IFC, because they no longer have an obligation to listen to USC and USG policy. 
“I think the disconnect lies in that they want to be having these conversations and see how we can work together,” Woodworth said. “But we can’t work together if they’re not part of the University.”
 The disaffiliation was a step back for USG, Woodworth said.
“We’ve wanted to have a more active role in informing these policies,” she said. “When IFC decided to disaffiliate, that put a huge hole into our efforts because they’re now under no obligation to listen to us or take us seriously.”
USG has taken its own actions to inform those who are more prone to being negatively affected by fraternities about the resources that they have at USC. 
“We’ve been trying to reach out to first years, been working with RAs, we have been working with SAGE — Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment — and they have been doing a lot of work to support survivors, and we’ve been collaborating with them extensively,” Woodworth said. 
Although election season is underway, USG’s 142nd cabinet still has about a month and a half left of its term, allowing for more progression in different sectors as seats in the office close. Woodworth will be speaking at the State of USG Address, highlighting her cabinet’s progress, projects they are proud of and more. The State of USG Address will be held March 21.

The First Generation Student Union hosted a town hall Wednesday night with its intention — according to its Feb. 8 Instagram post — to “shed light on [first generation students’] existence; providing a platform to voice what we aspire to be, what we know is right, and what we deserve from the university.” 
The event comes in the wake of the Undergraduate Student Government postponing the formation of a first generation student assembly until the fall. 
Andrew Mecatl, a junior majoring in law, history and culture and the co-president of FGSU, said the intention of this meeting was to elevate the often-overlooked voices of first-generation students.
“Although we make up 23% of the total USC population, we are a shadow population here on campus,” Mecatl said. “There are rarely any opportunities for us to voice our identity or voice what concerns we have on campus.”
The town hall opened with various first-generation USG candidates speaking on their experiences before opening up to wider audiences. A common theme throughout the event was the sense of culture shock students experienced when first arriving at USC, as well as the struggle to find a first-generation community.
Several students also said the University needs to do a better job at advertising the resources available to first-generation students. Alyssa Felix-Arreola, a senior majoring in global health and the co-president of FGSU, said there is a disconnect between the resources offered at USC by USG and those who need them.
“There’s a lot of resources that I use that USC has to offer, and a lot of them are not centralized,” she said. “It’s important that within these town halls, we actually get to learn about these resources. Then we get to say okay, we have these resources: How do we centralize them?”
Finances were another area of concern for many first-generation students. Speakers brought up anxieties regarding the lack of a housing guarantee after sophomore year and the predatory nature of many of the landlords in the area surrounding USC. 
Shriya Patel, FGSU’s director of communications and a junior majoring in aerospace engineering, said that being able to afford tuition was a massive stressor for first-generation students. 
“Even as much as people say, ‘Oh, you could take out a loan’ — that’s a process,” Patel said. “It’s also assuming that [we] have the credit background to be approved for it.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan after the event, Mecatl said the town hall was a success.
“There were conversations of academic experiences, emotional experiences, social experiences, and we had these experiences amplified here today,” Mecalt said. “That was exactly what we wanted.”

What is the biggest change that has occurred in the political landscape? What is the process behind writing a speech for the President? How has the dynamic of news reporting changed with the rise of social media? Is there more pizza? 
These are just some of the questions students ask at Pizza and Politics, an event series hosted by the Center for the Political Future on selected Wednesdays. This semester, students can expect to meet CPF fellows such as Emmy and Peabody award winner Hank Plante, former district attorney for Los Angeles Ira Reiner and former White House senior speechwriter John McConnell.
Kamy Akhavan, executive director of CPF, said he took pride in providing the rare opportunity for the student body to meet the fellows at the Center. Akhavan said the ultimate objective of the series was to “bring national politics alive on the USC campus.”
“We wanted to make these political figures that you see on television very accessible to students so you can talk to them, ask them questions, have casual conversation over pizza and learn about current events in a very nonthreatening, fun environment,” Akhavan said.
CPF is mindful about presenting a range of political ideologies in every Pizza and Politics event that students can benefit from, Akhavan said. In one event, speakers ranged from a Republican speechwriter to a Democrat district attorney.   
“We don’t want to skew responses towards a particular ideology,” Akhavan said. “The idea is to challenge people with their own thoughts so they can flex their opinions muscles and strengthen them and leave the event feeling like [they were] challenged and validated.”
Jacob Thompson, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said the variety of discussions that CPF fellows are putting on the table is what makes the Pizza and Politics series rewarding. After seeing a sign about the Pizza and Politics event a few semesters earlier, Thompson said he was interested by the idea of communicating with well-known politicians and gaining insightful perspectives. 
“The environment is really relaxed,” Thompson said. “I think my favorite part is coming in here and getting to sit down and converse and see both sides of the [conversation] and hear different perspectives.” 
Asked to describe the event in three words, John McConnell, a CPF Spring 2023 Parikh Family Fellow, replied: “Good for everybody” — students and fellows alike.
“I always enjoy meeting with students, and I always enjoy getting a chance to talk a little bit about what I know,” said McConnell, who served as senior speechwriter for former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney. “Just as importantly, I want to know about them, where they’re from, what they’re studying and what is generally on their minds when it comes to the issues facing the country … so it’s a great opportunity to have a very comfortable, low key exchange of thoughts and ideas.”
The organized and routine nature of Pizza and Politics has expanded McConnell’s outreach to the USC community and allowed him “to cross paths to more students than [he] would have met otherwise”.
Akhavan said that the Center has improved in gaining more student engagement and participation in the past two years and hopes to expand their program to a larger student audience.
“The room today was very busy,” Akhavan said. “Two years ago, there was maybe five or ten people in the room. Today it seemed like there was closer to thirty. We want more people to come and experience what this is all about and if they like it, keep coming back, invite their friends, do it more … We want to outgrow where this is taking place. That’s the real improvement that we would like to have.”

The Trojans are coming off a two-game losing streak against Oregon and Oregon State as they prepare for tonight’s game against UC Berkeley. On Saturday, USC lost a close game against Oregon State after leading by one point with less than two minutes left. Freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu had a good game but too many missed 3-pointers from the Trojans eventually built up to a late loss.
“We have to make a higher percentage of our 3-point shots,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We only made one the other night. That’s the lowest we’ve made in quite a few years here at USC. You can’t expect to score a lot of points in a college basketball game by making only one three. We have to do a better job of taking open shots, creating for each other on the offensive end, and then someone has to step up and make a few.”
Fifth year guard Drew Peterson said the team has been busy practicing their shooting.
“We’re in the gym and we’re all getting shots up,” Peterson said. “A lot of guys came in earlier the last few days, and we’re gonna keep doing that.”
Aside from the team making 1 of 14 3-pointers at Oregon State, Enfield attributed part of the loss to issues with the defense.
Senior guard Boogie Ellis also stressed the importance of focusing on defense in practice.
“[We’re] definitely working on defense via more physical rebounding, communicating, being in gaps and stuff like that,” Ellis said.
Enfield and the players are looking ahead to Thursday night’s game against Berkeley. Despite the Golden Bears’ 9-game losing streak and their last-place ranking in the Pac-12, Enfield is approaching the game with the same mindset as always.
“Cal played a tough overtime game against Arizona State on Saturday, so they are playing pretty good basketball, and we don’t take any game lightly,” Enfield said. “Pac-12 league games are always competitive. We’ve lost two games in a row so it doesn’t matter who the next game is against. This is about our team and how we respond to our loss on Saturday.”
Peterson is ready to play a tough game.
“We got our backs against the wall a little bit, and we got to start a winning streak to make March Madness and potentially compete for that conference championship. [There’s] definitely a sense of urgency for us,” Peterson said.
The Trojans are also dealing with injuries before the Berkeley game. Sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters may remain out with a lower-body injury, and redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan will likely still be out with an ankle injury.
“We have two of our key players injured, and it’ll probably be a game time decision whether one or both play,” Enfield said. “Whoever is healthy and eligible to play will have to go out and give it their best effort. We have to win this game.” 
So far, things seem to be looking good for the Trojans, who have a 12-game winning streak at home. The players are happy to be at Galen Center again.
“I love being home. I love when they come out in support, and getting good crowds at Galen always gives us a little bit of an advantage. So it’s great whenever they can fill a stadium up,” Peterson said.
Ellis is also excited for the game.
“It’s always cool to be home,” Ellis said. “You know, mom’s right there watching the game, sisters and everything. So it’s fun to play in front of them … We’re coming off two losses, so I’m real eager to get another win.”
The Trojans look to break their losing streak with a win against Berkeley at Galen Center Thursday night at 7 p.m.

One journey that a sports fan goes through as a young kid is the process of selecting your favorite teams that will determine your mood each and every week for the rest of your life. After I made some really underwhelming choices with America’s major sports, I decided to spoil myself when it came to my European soccer team, choosing Manchester City after they won the 2012 Premier league in exciting fashion against their bitter rivals Manchester United.
After more than 10 years of constantly being in title contention, Manchester City’s stranglehold on the rest of England could be erased by a private investigator.
Manchester City is currently being charged with breaching financial fair play rules over 100 times in less than a decade. You might ask, weren’t they just under investigation for the exact same thing? The key difference is that as opposed to getting investigated by UEFA, this time it is the Premier League doing the digging into the past. Being their governing body, the league has more abilities for punishment than UEFA.
The most important privilege they hold over UEFA is the ability to block any appeals to come from the club. City maintains their position that they did not break any rules. Their fans are even responding defiantly by booing the Premier League anthem before every game since the announcement. This response has seemed to give the club a boost as they are locked into a tight title race with matches against other contenders coming up.
FIFA Financial Play rules deem that a club can only spend money that they make themselves. They cannot simply benefit off the back of rich ownership because then it would completely lose touch with the fact that it just used to be the working class playing soccer. This means that Manchester City is accused of not complying with an investigation where they allegedly paid previous coach Manuel Pelligrini much more than they stated in their official documents.
Their previous punishment from UEFA (that was later overturned) of being banned from the Champions League is a cakewalk compared to what they face now. The club is subject to any of the following actions: league point deductions, match replays, blocks being placed on registration of any incoming players and expulsion from the league itself.
Expulsion from the league would be way worse than any fine the club could receive. It would effectively rip the team to shreds and cause them to lose all of their key figures. Pep Guardiola, Kevin de Bruyne, Erling Haaland and the rest of the starting 11 plus bench would surely be out the door. Especially given the fact that the Championship, League 1 and League 2 are not obligated to accept the club into their system. With something like this being so unprecedented, there is no “official” way to place them in any division.
There are eight trophies up for grabs should the Premier League deem them guilty. This would result in Manchester United gaining two more titles, Liverpool gaining one more title and Tottenham finally dusting off their empty trophy cabinet with a Carabao Cup of their own. Hilariously enough, the club would not lose any of their UEFA Champions League titles because they have failed to win one. Before they break out the confetti cannons, it is important to note that it is another possibility that the league will just void the entire season and say there was no champion for any of the league’s three trophies.
Many fans are comparing this to the Juventus situation where the club was recently docked 15 points and was sent from third place to middle of the table. This situation is different because Juventus would claim to profit on player swap and cook the books when they really weren’t making any money at all. If City is found guilty on even a quarter of their allegations, it will already top Juventus’ situation. The main difference is that Manchester City carried on cheating for a decade, while Juventus cheated during the seasons affected by the coronavirus to stay afloat and pay all of their stars.
If the punishment is anything more than a fine, it is inevitable that the club would lose all of their fair weather and maybe even their moderate weather fan. Keep in mind, this is a club that has been in the shadows of their brother across the town for their entire existence which makes die-hard fans hard to find as it is. However, no matter the decision of the private investigators, I will be sticking to my 11-year-old self’s judgment.

After a 25-28 season which saw USC finish last in the Pac-12, the Trojans will look to new Head Coach Andy Stankiewicz to get them back to the College World Series for the first time since 2001. Despite having the sport’s most national championships with 12, the Trojans have struggled in the 21st century, with only two World Series appearances and 15 losing seasons in the Pac-12. 
The Trojans turn to Stankiewicz, who spent the last 11 years coaching Grand Canyon University. Stankiewicz, who is from California and played his college baseball at Pepperdine University, said he is honored to coach such a historic baseball program.
“[The thing about] the history of this program, it’s so rich and so strong [that] I want to be a part of it,” said Stankiewicz in an interview with The Daily Trojan. “I wanted to be a part of it when I lived here. This baseball program, it’s always been in my mind one of the best in the nation.”
At Grand Canyon, Stankiewicz had a record of 341-239-2 while he oversaw the program’s transition from the Pacific West Conference (Division II) to the Western Athletic Conference (Division I). He won the WAC Coach of the Year four times during his tenure and the WAC conference championship in 2021. He hopes to apply that experience to his tenure at USC.
“We got better at Grand Canyon when we got better and more competitive inside the program,” Stankiewicz said. “We’re gonna recruit players that are going to come in and want to take [a starter’s] job and the [starter’s] saying, ‘No I’m not losing my job’ … When every day at practice is a competition between your teammates and yourself, that is going to make our program even better.”
This attitude has passed onto the players, who notice differences in energy and intensity from the new coaching staff.
“Just the tempo and the energy everyone brings day to day, it’s been really electric and I’m excited to see that come out on the field,” said junior pitcher Jaden Agassi.
Senior infielder Nick Lopez has also noticed better, more well-run practices.
“The energy they bring is a lot different,” Lopez said. “I think that the practices are going way more smoothly, seem more professional and everything is way more fun.”
In the Pac-12 baseball preseason coaches poll, the Trojans were picked to finish second-to-last in the conference. Agassi described this selection as “bulletin board material,” which can motivate the squad going forward.
“Honestly, that’s awesome,” Agassi said. “It gives us that chip on our shoulder, and we’re ready to prove some people wrong.”
The Trojans lost key contributors, sophomore infielder D’Andre Smith, sophomore pitcher Matt Keating, redshirt sophomore outfielder Rhylan Thomas and redshirt sophomore outfielder Tyresse Turner, to the 2022 MLB Draft and lost other players to the transfer portal. The Trojans bring eight new freshmen to the team and a host of other transfers, leaving upperclassmen to help get the newer players accustomed to the program and its culture.
“One thing this coaching staff has really changed is [eliminating the idea of grades] there’s no freshmen, there’s no seniors,” Agassi said. “Everybody’s helping everybody and everybody wants to get better, and everyone has the same goal.”
The players are excited and ready to show the country that the team is much improved and better than last year. 
“I want to come out as a team and show everybody that we’re not a second-to-last placed team, even though last year we didn’t do well as a team,” Lopez said. “I want to come back as a team and to know that I was a part of the team, that we made a change and USC’s back to where it needs to be.”
The Trojans open up the season against Marist College Friday at 6:30 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

When Los Angeles received an unprecedented amount of rain two weeks ago, I thought for sure that USC was going to turn into Atlantis. A simple walk to CVS was nearly impossible due to flash floods rising above the curb and spilling onto the sidewalk. My walk from my writing seminar to Tutor Campus Center left my shoes completely inundated with rainwater. 
While I don’t claim to be an expert on environmental issues, it’s no secret that an efficient drainage system can help nourish the environment and conserve water. It’s also not a secret that a water shortage is one of the most pressing environmental issues we face today. However, while it’s not a secret, it’s not something that is often addressed. An ongoing and aggressive drought in California has left the state in a predicament where 3% of its population — ore than 1 million people — lack access to safe drinking water. As the nation’s largest provider of agricultural goods, and with the population steadily increasing, it’s become apparent that it’s time for everyone to do their part — now or never. 
Climate change must be addressed from both a micro and macro level. From a micro level, it’s important to recycle and limit how much electricity and water an individual uses. Buying sustainable products and limiting waste have slowly started to become the norm. However, institutions that make sizable impacts through large-scale operations and productions also need to reassess the impact they have on the environment. USC is one of these institutions.
Every single night, the University wastes gallons upon gallons of water with an inefficient lawn sprinkler system. In the USC Village, half of the water oversprays or runs off onto the sidewalk. Students dodge to avoid puddles and the concrete is dark and damp as the morning sun rises. While it might seem like a small inconvenience for students, the repercussions are anything but.
This egregious waste of water is incredibly ironic when one considers the responsibility the administration placed upon students by advising they tak five-minute showers. Passively placing a basket of shower timers in the dorm lobby is nothing more than performative in comparison to a suitable drainage system. 
While it’s undeniable that the campus’ beauty and status feel like a secret garden within a manor of concrete and air pollution, it inherently places itself into a precarious position where the school has no choice but to toe the line between sustainability and beautification. This doesn’t seem to be something that the school has realized. The 39 decorative fountains permeating campus serve as a visible reminder. 
The damage actively committed by USC isn’t just limited to water usage. The University’s recent decision to join the Big 10 athletic conference, while a financially astute decision, will result in teams traversing at least 3,000 and up to 6,000 miles by airplane on a weekly basis. This will make an entire legion of schools complicit in egregious greenhouse gas emissions from jet fuel. It’ll become the sisterhood of the traveling environmental damage. 
Instead, USC has effectively communicated that fighting climate change is in the hands of the individual rather than the institution. They seem to think that unenforced recycling stations are only available in certain parts of campus and a gentle reminder at convocation to avoid single-use plastic water bottles alleviates the University from large-scale environmental reform. It’s ignorant and performative at best, dubious and hypocritical at worst. 
USC wants its students to learn about the infrastructure of society so that they can change the world and become the leaders of tomorrow. As an institution with undeniable financial and cultural privileges that outshines many others, this should be possible. However, all of that will be rendered pointless if USC continues on its current course of doing the exact opposite. Making a meaningful impact on the climate takes more than aluminum water bottles and bold promises. It takes institutional change and a reevaluation of priorities. Had efficient drainage and water collection systems existed, that rain could have been recycled and preserved as a replenishment resource. Although it prides itself on a “green campus,” the time is now for it to reassess just how green it actually is.

I think I might be in a toxic relationship. I’m on my knees begging for forgiveness after I failed to execute a request properly. Then I find myself searching for hours on end for a way to redeem myself, only to be told that I presented my offer of redemption too late. Schedules are edited at whim, and I am expected to drop everything just because I am supposed to be devoted. I question this relationship, and I do really want to fix it — to fix myself to serve it better. 
Perhaps, my analogy is too obvious. I am, of course, talking about my major: architecture.
To most (the some 20,500 non-architecture majors), the field seems like a substantial amount of work. Your friends in the program likely declined that rager last weekend, citing their need to catch up on their latest project. Or perhaps you’ve never heard of the program. I wouldn’t blame you. After all, it doesn’t even have a donor’s name in front of it. Schools at USC tout their benefactors’ names like students do their astrology signs. Architecture sticks out of the roster like a sore, underfunded thumb.
But my issues with the School of Architecture, or SoA as these minimalist, self-proclaimed design geniuses call it, go beyond the lack of funding. Sure, I have to pay for materials, access to design tools and machines vital to the curriculum and arrange my own transportation to mandatory field trips — but we’re USC students, of course we have the funds for that. Tuition is a reasonable $65 thousand, what’s a few more thousand dollars? Honestly, I’m more surprised at the fact that they’ve managed to wring the fun out of field trips than I am infuriated by the costs.
What truly unhinges me, though, is the sheer lack of empathy ingrained within the program. Last semester, we met for four, four-hour blocks per week, with each meeting evaluating the work done in the last — adding more to be scrutinized in the future. It was a constant loop of labor; while I had Wednesdays off, I was never truly free — I was often spending 8-12 hours in the library in an attempt to catch up for Thursday. The department never provided accommodations, so if you missed a week due to illness (I did, twice) you were left to scramble to ensure that you finished the assignment by the review date, where the unforgiving jury would criticize you, saying that your project was unfinished. All energy was turned to serve the all-mighty deadline, as it confronted you unimpressed by your latest offering, only to kick you down and have you repeat the process in a manner that would make Sisyphus look on in horror.
The resulting culture is one indulged in masochism. Students would compete over how many all-nighters they put in or laugh about ending their lives over a project. The negativity was palpable, even suffocating. Conversations I had with friends in the program would devolve into trauma-laced negativity fests where we would exchange the latest horrors: One student was criticized in front of the class for not washing his hands when the professor saw fingerprints on his model. Two students managed 48 hours of consecutive work on one project. Another had to restart her anti-anxiety pills.
These kinds of conditions are unforgivable by any standard, however, they are often justified by the profession itself. In the workforce, unpaid overtime is almost expected, which is embittered by the fact that recent grads of SoA make around $48,000 and are expected to eventually earn $80,000. But, if you’re passionate about your work, then it isn’t truly work, right? It’s common practice within the field to have a side hustle, so become a YouTuber, or even a professor, and perpetuate the toxic work culture pervading the profession to a generation of malleable youth. To prepare students for the profession, they must be exposed to the worst of it. 
However, these problems are actually entirely remediable. The curriculum is extremely flexible, and is completely reset every year. However, all that these resets appear to do for the program is allow professors to push curriculums that are just as demanding but have never been tried before. As a freshman, I was made to learn Grasshopper, a program typically taught to 4th and 5th years that is hardly ever used in practical settings. Don’t ask, I am just as dumbfounded as you are. 
The problem is that professors are teaching what they know about the field: It’s intensive, soul-crushing and will take every last fiber of your being to survive. It’s all they know. I can’t really blame them for passing their trauma down to us because it’s what they’re being told to teach. And I think it might be working. I developed acute anxiety as a result of the first semester. So this time around, I have to brave a full-time job’s worth of hours punctuated by anxiety attacks that render me unable to actually do the work for my major, or any other class for that matter.
I wish I could end this piece saying that things are changing, that the school and the profession are responding to the humanitarian crisis pervading them. But I don’t think they are. I don’t know when they will or if they will. I want to create things that make people happy, that inspire joy, but producing them brings me pain. It hurts. And honestly, I don’t know how much longer I can carry on this relationship. 
If architecture doesn’t care about me, then why should I care about it?

Hear me out: I wish I had a friend like M3GAN. Yes, M3GAN, the iconic killer robot doll from the recent hit movie “M3GAN.” She’s fun and darkly vindictive — the kind of character I aspire to be. Although I don’t necessarily approve of the methods she uses to achieve her goals, I can appreciate the protective intentions behind them. With a little moral adjustment, she could be my best friend if she wanted to be.
The whole character of M3GAN actually reminded me of “Orphan: First Kill” (2022), a film I watched recently about a serial killer going by the name of Esther (Isabelle Fuhrmann). I guess there’s something about creepy killers who assume the figures and outward appearances of young girls. To me, M3GAN is more terrifying than Esther because she represents the perfect blend of reality and animation: technology. 
That relationship between what’s artificial and what’s real — and the thin line between both — is what I believe the film makes a statement about. 
Watching the movie, I loved M3GAN’s power over her surrounding technology. I particularly enjoyed the control she assumed in her relationships with Cady (Violet McGraw), her primary user, and Gemma (Allison Williams), her creator. I wanted to be powerful too. There’s just something about M3GAN and what puppeteer Adrien Morot, refers to as her “unsettling” look. In an interview with Variety, Morot said the logistical behind-the-scenes operations of M3GAN involved using animation to move her lips and eyes.
That’s not all. During an interview on “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” Williams discussed how the creators made M3GAN come to life. M3GAN was a combination of real-life actress Amie Donald’s movements and an essentially controller-activated animatronic. M3GAN occupies this transitory space of not being quite a real person and not being entirely just a robot either, which is one of the ethical debates at the core of the film. 
In my “History of Animation” class last semester, I learned that the very idea of animation is traditionally thought of as placing drawings together to give off the illusion of movement. Based on this, I think the character of M3GAN embodies the thought process that shaped the intent of animation and animators. First, we have the prototype of M3GAN who is this inanimate object before she’s created and brought to life.
When she is ultimately activated, she becomes a series of commands that are strung together to make her who she is. As a word, animation’s definition (according to Merriam-Webster) means “to give life to.” 
In “M3GAN,” that’s what Gemma does to M3GAN. In a sort of meta way, that’s the procedure we see happening with creating M3GAN offscreen as well. She’s brought to life.
Although I’m not an animator myself and will constantly be in awe of those who are, I love that even when M3GAN does make use of computer-generated imagery, her presence is theoretically lifelike. This relates to a real-life phenomenon in animation called the “uncanny valley.” 
Basically, the “uncanny valley” refers to the weird sensation one can get while viewing images that are lifelike enough to seem real, yet have that strange quality that makes them decidedly not real. (For more context, just look at films where this is notably prominent like “The Polar Express” (2004). ) It’s the effect that Morot seems to describe when he says that M3GAN is meant to give off that unsettling feeling.
Writing for the IEEE, Institute of Electrical and Electronics, Spectrum, Rina Diane Caballar explains that the “uncanny valley” principle was coined by former Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Masahiro Mori, who said that as robots’ lifelike qualities increase, people are more likely to gravitate toward those robots. Once robots reach a certain level of lifelike quality, that feeling of appeal plateaus. People begin experiencing feelings of unease. 
It’s safe to say that, given the horror bent of “M3GAN,” the filmmakers’ manifestation of the “uncanny valley” was deliberate. In fact, it added to the film’s theme, that what’s artificial can be made into something more human, sometimes in dangerous ways. 
M3GAN, therefore, is applicable to discussions of animation and the digital arts. At the same time that she fits into established principles and conceptual underpinnings of these technological art forms, her cinematic existence also makes a broader statement: Humanity has to be careful about attributing human qualities to technology.
M3GAN can be anyone’s friend. For everyone’s safety, though, it might be better that she stays inanimate.

“Blanc” is a two-person co-op video game with a hand-drawn black-and-white art style that tells the story of a wolf cub and a fawn trying to find their families after a sudden snowstorm by following their families’ prints in the snow. The wolf cub can fit through smaller gaps, cut through ropes with its teeth and pull on obstacles, while the fawn can jump higher, let the wolf jump on its back and push obstacles. With these abilities, the wolf cub and the fawn must help each other traverse the forbidding landscape. Developer Casus Ludi and publisher Gearbox Publishing released the game on Feb. 14 on Nintendo Switch, Steam and the Epic Games Store. 
“Blanc” is by no means fast-paced. The first 15 minutes mostly involve walking and watching cutscenes, and early puzzles are very simple, likely meant to introduce players to the game’s controls. The game gradually ramps up, with more complex puzzles — including multiple instances of helping passing ducklings through harsh winds — appearing as the game progresses. 
However, even with the most complex puzzles, the greatest challenge is not with the gameplay but rather wrestling with the camera and movement. The camera often has to maintain awkward positions in an attempt to show both independently moving characters. Sometimes it becomes necessary to move a character to a different position just so whoever’s controlling the other character can see what they’re doing. Theoretically, this could add to the collaborative experience, but more often it just makes the player feel stuck. All in all, these issues and the game’s simplicity combine to create the feeling that the player knows exactly what they’re supposed to do but struggle while doing it. This struggle can become equally frustrating and boring.
Despite these problems, “Blanc” has many strong suits. The game’s art style, of course, is gorgeous. Its graphics were completely hand-drawn before they were rendered in 3D, and its minimalistic black-and-white look conveys both the biting cold and the calm of a landscape after a blizzard. There are moments where the characters get their families’ scent that are downright magical: The adult wolves and deer appear in a pointillist style, walking slowly across their tracks in the snow as the young protagonists look on. 
The game’s sound is also delightful. The characters’ sound design is a big part of what makes them adorable — the wolf’s yips and barks are particularly sweet. The crunch of the snow is immersive and nostalgic. The soundtrack is as minimal as the art style, using light piano that sometimes ramps up to highlight the game’s progression.
When the gameplay works as intended, it can also be very satisfying. “Blanc” is not the kind of game that wants you to bang your head against a wall. Instead, it asks you to relax and forge a connection with your playing partner. 
Each puzzle relies on the wolf cub and fawn’s strengths, and figuring out what to do never takes long but always feels like an accomplishment. Puzzles often box you into one small area, but “Blanc” intersperses these with segments where you run freely along a path, frolicking happily with your playing partner. These moments encourage players to appreciate the game’s art and music, and they break up the occasional claustrophobia the puzzle areas can create.
Finally, the game’s simplicity is also a strong suit. Its controls are incredibly easy to pick up, and the lack of text means no language barriers and less mental strain. It only takes a few hours to play, so it’s easy to find the time for it — even when balancing two schedules for co-op gameplay. The story is minimal and lighthearted, and you don’t have to worry about jumpscares or tragedies around the corner. Essentially, “Blanc” is not an edge-of-your-seat kind of game. At its best, it’s easy, calm and relaxing. 
It’s important to note that “Blanc” is Casus Ludi’s first video game. According to a June 28 press release, they aimed to “create a meaningful experience without antagonism, based on mutual aid and empathy, for everyone to enjoy no matter their skill level.” Despite growing pains, they largely accomplished that. 
“Blanc” is a game that knows what it is. It’s not meant to be a particularly deep story, but it’s heartwarming. Its puzzles are not meant to be particularly challenging, but they’re satisfying. It’s not meant to be something you grind on until you’re powerful. Instead, it centers around relationships. As the fawn and wolf help each other, they grow closer, and so do you and the person you’re playing with. That’s where the power of “Blanc” lies.
