Unless you’ve already decided that stepping out for class isn’t really your style, you’ve probably noticed that California has been sweltering recently. With such unrelenting heat, it appears summer will be around for a while longer, bringing back memories of those inner-city block parties and BBQs common in the ’90s.
I’m talking about the ones that you would see in TV shows and movies, but some of you might know from firsthand experience the big gatherings that would stretch all the way down the neighborhood in the blistering summer heat, or smaller gatherings with aunts, uncles and cousins you now only see in old family pictures.
These parties would have some of the best BBQs. Everyone would bring carefree attitudes along with their food. If there was a pool, everyone would be swimming at some point, and you could always count on someone being thrown in. If there wasn’t a pool, a broken fire hydrant or a sprinklers would often be substituted. Kids would run around playing games, and the adults would talk about the days when they were kids. These were the kickbacks and potlucks before kickbacks and potlucks were a thing, and they were one of the great things that unfortunately peaked in the ’90s.
But even better than the food, the fun and the company at these get-togethers was the music. Someone with an oversized boom box for the smaller parties or an expansive speaker set-up for the larger parties would play the latest and greatest mixed with some old-school jams to set the tone for the party. The music would jump around from something that would infect your body with the spirit of dance to something else that makes you think everything is right in the world in that moment. Whoever was controlling the tunes had to have a superb taste in music, because they were responsible for making memories for everyone at the party.
I couldn’t include every single song that I could think of, but this playlist offers a good taste of what you could expect back in the day. These songs really capture the feeling of being at a BBQ with your extended family or going to the neighborhood party a couple of blocks down the street, so grab a plate and hang out while it’s still hot outside.

The 411: Welcome to the 21st century, Leavey — so glad you decided to join us!
Campus Leaders
USG Gets its First Session On!: The Undergraduate Student Government convened on Tuesday for its first session of the year. The topic of the day? College affordability. USG President Rini Sampath said she is focusing on “reaching out to different cultural assemblies to see how their constituents are affected by college affordability.” Sampath also talked about tackling the issue of mental health on campus.
The 411: Sampath is on the march to find ways to make college a healthier, more affordable environment!
College Life
Campus Food Guide: Let’s take a look at your on-campus dining:
Dining Halls: Oh, you lucky freshmen and your unlimited meal swipes. You don’t know how good you have it. EVK, Cafe 84 and Parkside may not be the most glamorous options, but at least you can go there for breakfast and a late night snack!
Campus Center: The aptly named Campus Center has what everyone is looking for, whether it’s a salad or a pizza … for a price. Here you can use your dining or discretionary dollars. California Pizza Kitchen? Check. Panda Express? Check. Seeds? Check. Lemonade? Check. Any questions?
TroGro, LiteraTea, Nekter and more: Here’s where it gets interesting. There’s all kinds of lesser-known dining options for the more adventurous students. Check out the cafe in the new Annenberg building or get your drink on at Nekter near the School of Architecture.
The 411: What’s the best? That’s up to you. If you’re into stray cats, by all means go hang out with EVKitty.
Student Voices
Issue: Should the USC Campus ban smoking on campus?
Point: “Being surrounded by smoking, even just through the sight of strangers lighting up on campus, creates a mentality that the act is not just condoned, but also celebrated. If the University supports the education and awareness of cigarette use and seeks further, more decisive action, then there is potential to create meaningful progress on our campus.” – Danni Wang, Junior, Lifestyle Editor
Counterpoint: “Considering that the University often fails to enforce its current smoking policy on the University Park Campus — which prohibits smoking in enclosed buildings; within 10 feet of outdoor dining areas; in facilities, vehicles and “smoke-free” designated areas; and in locations during indoor events — it is fair to wonder whether a more comprehensive smoke-free policy will carry the weight it should.” – Sonali Seth, sophomore, Editorial Director
The 411: Does USC need to change its policies about smoking on campus? Or is it just pointless?
Sports
Soccer Stars: Last Friday, the Women of Troy beat UC Riverside 2-0, elevating their record to 2-1. The win was important because other SoCal schools like UCLA and Pepperdine are ranked in the Top 25. However, the No. 15 Trojans are looking to move up.
The 411: The USC women’s soccer team is on the path to success.
Football Focus: After Steve Sarkisian’s inappropriate behavior made national news, the Trojans are more focused as they head toward their first football game with Arkansas State. “I think this brought us closer together,” said quarterback Cody Kessler about Sark’s actions last week. Coach Sark has even started a “Finish Challenge” to get players to push their energy up at the end of drills.
The 411: Sark may have made some mistakes, but the football team is looking good heading into the season. #NoMoreLastMinuteLosses
Volleyball Vantage Point: Sophomore volleyball player Brittany Abercrombie has had one heck of a summer. She toured with the U.S. Collegiate Volleyball Team in China and is on track to become the next star player of the USC team. Fans can check out her mad skills on Sept. 10 at the Galen Center.
The 411: We have the coolest collegiate athletes in the world. Period.
Pop Culture
VMAs 2015: The MTV Video Music Awards aired Sunday, hosted by pop singer and self-proclaimed twerking expert Miley Cyrus.
The Semi-Good: Justin Bieber got a new haircut and sang his new single “What Do You Mean?” Then, the Biebs broke down into tears. Was it gratitude from fans after being in the spotlight for his bad behavior? Or was he just lamenting over his split ends? We’ll let you be the judge.
The Kinda-Bad: You can call it a poor man’s Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction, but Miley exposed one of her boobs on live television. The scantily clad host had good comedic timing throughout the night, even when her potty mouth kept those censors busier than usual. Oh, and she went all Beyonce on us and released a new album after the show. Meanwhile, Kanye accepted the Video Vanguard Award and tried but failed to explain his complex feelings.
The Downright Ugly: Nicki Minaj won the Hip-Hop Video Award, but her speech derailed soon after she took the stage. Earlier this year, Minaj discovered she wasn’t nominated for Video of the Year and went on a Twitter rampage. Taylor Swift had beef with her comments before, but they made up during Nicki’s VMA performance. However, Miley had some not-so-positive words on Nicki’s controversy in a recent interview. Long story short, there’s some other bad blood brewing.
The 411: Taylor Swift won the evening, Kanye’s pushing for the White House, Miley loves exposing her body, the Biebs couldn’t hold it together and Nicki Minaj made everyone uncomfortable.

Summer break has ended, and most people are being forced to say goodbye to sandals and crop tops. However, warm weather is here to stay in Southern California, which makes varying outfits for the hot weather a year-round dilemma for USC students. Though accessories may seem small and unimportant, it is always the small details that make a huge difference, meaning accessories have the power to either make or break your outfit.
So then, what can students do to spice up their outfits and make a statement, when the thought of even putting on shorts makes you break into a sweat? Since summer is hot and sticky, your last thought would be to throw on some accessories to weigh you down and make things even tougher. However, what you accessorize your outfit with is incredibly important. Don’t go for heavier and chunkier statement pieces, but rather go for something lighter in both weight and design. Choose lighter and simpler pieces that can shine on their own, and in a more subtle way.
This summer’s trends were all about metallic pieces, chokers and athletic wear, and you can definitely continue that into the fall. Metallics have come and gone in terms of popularity, but once again, it’s back, and it looks as if they are hotter than ever. From sunglasses to headbands, it is easy to add a little metallic touch to change your outfit. Designers, from high end to low, are creating these staples. They’re great to compliment summer outfits by adding a little flare and shine.
Chokers are another accessory trend that is making a comeback. Though just the thought of this trend brings up feelings of nostalgia from the ’90s, it is back and better than ever. Chokers are regaining popularity in different materials such a string, metal and cloth.
Another summer accessory trend that was popular over the summer was athletic wear. Earlier in the year we saw sneakers became a fashion staple. Designers are now taking it to the next level, providing athletic-inspired accessories such as bracelets and headbands. Giving fitness outfits a makeover for the fall would help keep this look fresh and on the run.
Southern California weather is great for students who always want to stand out when it comes to fashion. Warm weather calls for bright and bold clothing choices. When accessorizing, think about the entire outfit. If you are wearing simple clothes with neutral colors, then accessorizing with bolder pieces is ideal. Yet be careful not to mix too many bold pieces, which would be too much for the eye. We are lucky to have the majority of the year filled with sunny days here on the West Coast. In other states, students, particularly in the north, are forced to wear darker, more depressing colors during the colder seasons. Fortunately, we have the option of wearing our summer clothes all year long. Though California can get a little colder during the fall and winter seasons, simply throwing on a thin coat or putting on some warm, yet trendy boots, can help you to recycle your summer clothes and accessories throughout the year.

As the USC football team prepares to kick off its 2015 season, the Daily Trojan will be catching up with former USC players as the Trojans play week in and week out. In the first edition of our exclusive series, “Back to School,” the DT caught up with former USC All-American linebacker Willie McGinest.
Before Su’a Cravens, another USC linebacker used to terrorize opposing collegiate offenses game in and game out.
Three-time Super Bowl Champion and 2015 New England Patriots Hall of Fame inductee Willie McGinest anchored the Trojans’ defense in the early ‘90s, racking up All-American               and all-conference honors before going on to have a successful 15-year career in the NFL with the New England Patriots and Cleveland Browns.
Since officially retiring in 2008, McGinest has gone on to join the NFL Network as a football analyst and believes that fans of his alma mater have a lot to look forward to when watching this year’s team.
“We have a lot of young and exciting players that are either in just their first or second year like Adoree’ [Jackson] and JuJu [Smith-Schuster], and I expect USC to be a top-five team,” McGinest said.
McGinest believes that head coach Steve Sarkisian and his staff solved the team’s biggest problem from last season on defense — depth.
“They had a great recruiting class, fortified their offensive and defensive lines, their linebacking core is very talented, and I’m excited to watch them play,” McGinest said.
The Trojans have a rich history of decorated linebackers from McGinest to the late Junior Seau and to Keith Rivers — all of whom wore the No. 55.
While Cravens doesn’t share the same number as the greats that came before him, he will look to carry on this tradition as he returns for his third year as a starter and newly appointed       co-team captain while playing strong side outside linebacker.
“Su’a has done a great job as linebacker,” McGinest said. “He’s tough, he can play in the box and he’s due for a great season.”
As for the other side of the ball, McGinest believes that that offense is in good hands with redshirt senior quarterback and preseason Heisman Trophy candidate Cody Kessler under center.
“Cody’s grown up,” McGinest said. “He’s had more time and experience with Sark’s system and with more weapons on the outside and a balance between the rushing and passing game, he will definitely put up points on the board.”
In their last regular season game against UCLA in 2013, McGinest fired up the Trojans by leading them out of the tunnel — an honor that he shares with other USC legends like Matt Leinart and Keyshawn Johnson.
“I really enjoyed leading the team out of the tunnel and being an ambassador for the program, though next time we hopefully win the game,” McGinest said.
Another project McGinest is working on is a partnership with DirecTV to bring college football to more students. He recently teamed up with DirectTV’s “NFL Sunday Ticket.TV U” to give students the ability to live stream games and have full access to watch their favorite NFL teams on Sundays this fall.
“I went to ’SC, was a college student and lived in a dorm and know that you just can’t throw satellites up anywhere, so this is an affordable package that is great for students,” McGinest said.
Back on the field, as the Trojans prepare to kick off the season ranked the No. 8 team in the country, McGinest gave his advice for this year’s team.
“They just need to buy in and take things one play at a time,” McGinest said. “They’ve got a great system and players so if they can play hard for four quarters every week, everything will work itself out.”

After a 2-0 win over UC Riverside last Friday, the USC women’s soccer team continues their season in Durham, North Carolina, this weekend with games against two top 20 teams.
The Women of Troy take on No. 18 Duke on Friday and       No. 4 ranked North Carolina on Sunday.
After going 2-1 to kick off the season, USC goes into this weekend ranked No. 15 in the country.
Earlier this season, in games against Texas Tech and Florida State, the team proved that they could compete with the finest of programs, earning their position as one of the best teams in the nation.
This weekend, the Women of Troy will face some tough competition, but head coach Keidane McAlpine has the utmost faith in his team.
“Having played Texas Tech and Florida State in the opening weekend has set the team into focus from the beginning — this is just the carry over,” McAlpine said. “They seem pretty relaxed and locked in.”
Not only is the coaching staff confident in the performance for this upcoming weekend, but the team appears calm, cool and collected as well.
But Reilly Parker, a redshirt junior and transfer from North Carolina, said that though the team seems poised from the outside, there is a healthy sense of urgency behind the scenes.
“I think there has definitely been a raise in the level of competition at practice,” she said. “And I think that’s because we know we’re playing two extremely competitive teams that grind for 90 minutes and win games with their grit and their heart. We had to prepare accordingly.”
With two challenging games ahead of them, the Women of Troy are planning on taking it one game at a time.
“The way we build our program is one of development. We want to get better throughout the year, regardless of opponent,” McAlpine said. “As far as this weekend, we only talk about Duke, we haven’t talked about North Carolina. There are definitely some things we’ve worked on this week that will be useful in both games, but they will be useful in both games and beyond.”
According to Parker, the game against Duke will be exciting to watch as the Women of Troy face a formation they have not yet seen this season. Because of this, the team will alter their usual game plan in order to compete.
“We worked on how we’re going to play within Duke’s system,” Parker said. “Practice this week has put emphasis on a lot of the little details that we really have to be locked in on. If you’re not, it’s going to show when it comes to game time.”
The Women of Troy have yet to face either the Blue Devils or the Tar Heels under the leadership and direction of second-year head coach McAlpine.
“In a game like this, you don’t have time to think about it, you just have to know [what you’re doing],” Parker said. “The biggest thing has been being present in the moment.”
This not only provides a remarkable opportunity for USC to make a nationwide statement, but it also serves as a chance for elite players Parker and Amanda Rooney, who also transferred from North Carolina, to go back to where it all started while now representing the Cardinal and Gold.
“Like a lot of us who have transferred, we have a lot to prove,” Parker said. “We want to show that even though one school didn’t necessarily work out, that we can kill it for this new team and be a presence. I really thought that I would be nervous, but I’m not. But I want to beat them, we all do. Every game is a battle.”
This weekend’s matches are just the first in a season where McAlpine and the rest of his coaching staff have upped the ante for opponents.
Durham will be one of the first of these trials where the team can demonstrate its worth as a program.
“We’re feeling good,” McAlpine said. “I think any time you play top teams it’s a chance to measure yourself. As much as you want to be good early, you want to be great late. So these two games are stepping in that direction.”

The No. 2 men’s water polo team is looking to start the season with a splash following a disappointing loss to UCLA in the NCAA championship game last year.
The Trojans have high expectations entering the season, looking to build on its unbelievable streak of 10 consecutive NCAA title match appearances.  In that time, the Trojans have been able to capture seven victories.
“We had a big streak going with the six wins in a row. That’s never been done before — that’s unbelievable,” junior driver Nick Bell said. “But that day we lost that championship and I could see it in everyone’s faces that we never want to see that happen again, so that’s definitely fueling us.”
The Trojans saw remarkable success last year after having their season get written off as a rebuilding year for a team stacked with freshmen. This year, the Trojans return nine true sophomores in a core unit that has gained valuable experience from last year’s championship run.
The team has only one player with three full years of experience: redshirt senior Mac Carden. Carden has 42 career goals as a two-meter player with 16 coming last season. He scored in 12 separate games, with four multiple goal outings.
As a three-time NCAA champion, Carden understands what the team needs to do if it hopes to regain its title.
“We pushed throughout all summer, and we’ve never wanted it more. We’re hungrier than ever right now, and that’s what keeps pushing us forward,” Carden said.  “Especially with the loss we had last year in the finals, nothing really changed.”
Carden will serve as one of three Trojan captains alongside sophomore All-Americans Mihajlo Milicevic and James Walters.  Though the sophomores are captains, there are certain leadership qualities that come with experience.
“Being the older guys we definitely have to take a leadership position,” Bell said of himself and the other upperclassmen. “Especially with this team, we have a lot of guys coming out of their freshman years so they only have one year of varsity experience.”
Bell has 43 career goals to his name, scoring over half of them last season.  Bell earned All-American Honorable Mention honors as well as a place on the NCAA All-Tournament Second Team.
Another All-American to keep an eye on this season is sophomore goalie McQuin Baron. Baron earned  All-American Second Team honors last season in a year in which he set a new record for saves in one season with 288. Baron was also a member of Team USA over the summer and helped the Americans secure their place in the 2016 Olympic Games.
Even though summer is the offseason, the team did a lot of work in preparation for the upcoming season.
“To get ready for season we did a lot of training, a lot of swimming,” Bell said.  “We had a lot of scrimmage games because we have a younger, less experienced unit, so we had scrimmages against Pepperdine, Long Beach, teams like that to get guys more game time.”
Carden used the words “excited,” “anxious” and “pumped” to describe the team’s mindset as it gets ready to kick off its season.
This weekend, the team will travel to La Jolla to participate in the Triton Invitational hosted by UC San Diego.
There, they will play official games against Cal Baptist and Concordia University, while taking on MPSF foes Pepperdine and UC Irvine in exhibition matches.
Though the Trojans have traditionally dominated these teams, players insist the success is not getting to their heads.
“There’s no reason that because we’ve beaten them that we should let up,” Bell said. “We should always take every game seriously like it’s the NCAA championship.”
The Trojans will put their championship attitude to the test as they splash into the season.

Tomorrow night will mark a new beginning for a program that has emerged out of a cloud of controversy and sanctions like a phoenix that is destined to be reborn again and march onto the national spotlight of college football.
At many points in the road leading up to this season, the program  momentarily took a hit and passed at its own fault, but regardless of the severity of any of these self-inflicted actions, it has and always will quickly rise from its ashes into a long-living being.
It seems unfitting to compare the Trojans to a Greek mythological bird, but I believe that the 2015 season will revive the historical tradition of victory that USC football prides itself on.
Don’t get me wrong. This year’s team has probably been through more than any other college football team, and I think it hasn’t gotten enough credit for the focus and maturity it has exerted during tough times.
Specifically, the team’s leadership — including that of team captains Cody Kessler, Max Tuerk, Su’a Cravens, Antwaun Woods and Anthony Sarao — has been phenomenal when it has come to keeping their teammates’ attention centered on the field during bumps in the road.
Fortunately, and I know it’s cliché, all that’s transpired up to now is in the past.
All of the excitement and anticipation that has been killing players, coaches and fans for months now has led up to what many people call Christmas in September — game day.
The road to the team’s first game sure hasn’t been as glamorous as that of the actual holiday itself. Instead of having the pleasure of building gingerbread houses, gift shopping and decorating Douglas Fir trees, USC players and coaches have been forced to overcome injuries, player personnel changes, student misconduct issues and some other off-the-field drama that I refuse to talk about anymore.
After months of practice and preparation, the team surely just wants to get on the field of the Coliseum Saturday night against Arkansas State and show why they were the media’s preseason pick to win the Pac-12 Conference Championship.
Ever since the Trojans defeated Nebraska in the National University Holiday Bowl, 45-42, last December, this team has been surrounded with a lot of hype, and now it’s time for them to show they’re for real.
Four years ago, a lot of hype surrounded a USC team that marched into the 2012 season ranked the No. 1 team in the nation. They played by the motto “Unfinished Business,” though they were never able to capitalize on that promise.
Even with senior quarterback Matt Barkley under center and loads of veteran talent on both sides of the ball, this Lane Kiffin-coached team stumbled to a 7-6 overall record and suffered an embarrassing loss in the Sun Bowl at the hands of Georgia Tech.
Expectations were high then and with the team returning one of the nation’s best quarterbacks in Cody Kessler, a veteran offensive line, one of the nation’s best defensive players in Su’a Cravens and Heisman Trophy candidate and perhaps the most dynamic player in all college football in Adoree’ Jackson, expectations should be just as high now.
In 2015, USC will feature a championship-caliber team that, barring any significant injuries to its key players, should expect to find itself in its first ever Pac-12 Championship Game on Dec. 5 at Levi’s Stadium.
According to the “USC RIPSIT Blog,” on the first day of fall camp, every player was handed a coin that inscribed with one lengthy word —Palinoia.
It’s defined as “the compulsive repetition of an act until it is perfect.”
This year’s team doesn’t have any business to finish. Rather, it should seek out to chase perfection one game at a time.
If it can do that, expect USC to finish towards the top of the national rankings in 2015.

To much of the outside world, Max Tuerk — USC’s starting center — is known through the lens of his accomplishments on the football field: an All-American across the board coming out of Rancho Santa Margarita high school four years ago, a solidified starter for the third consecutive season at USC after taking over a starting job in the final five games as a true freshman in 2012.
He has also been selected as a team captain for the second year in a row after being honored with a Pac-12 first-team selection last year as a junior.
Not to mention the fact that over the course of the next calendar year, Tuerk is expected to vie for All-American honors in his final season as a Trojan, graduate with a degree in public policy, planning and development, and quite possibly be selected in the first round of the 2016 NFL Draft.
On paper, he is a prototypical “college football star,” at a university that has churned out more NFL draft picks than any other college in history. Though many wish they could, few other college athletes in the nation carry a resume as extraordinary as Tuerk’s. Of those few, even fewer are able to exercise humility and discipline amid the enticing lure of the athletic spotlight.
Those who know him on a personal level are treated to an incredibly kind, humble and grounded individual, something relatively atypical for someone in his position.
More often a man of few words than many, Tuerk goes about his business on the team as a leader by example, rather than explanation. When he does speak up, however, his teammates listen.
In fact, his peers hold him in such high regard that his fellow football mates voted him in as one of five team captains for 2015, the second year in a row in which he has been bestowed the opportunity.
Discussing the honor of being selected again, Tuerk made it clear it is something he is incredibly grateful for.
“It’s definitely a big honor for me to be a captain for the second time, mainly because the team votes in the captains,” Tuerk said. “I really respect my teammates, and it’s awesome that they chose to vote me in again.”
Tuerk is ready to embrace his role as a captain and leader even more so this year than in the past. When asked about his goals as a senior captain, his response was clear.
“I am going to try to be a little more vocal this year,” Tuerk said. “And, obviously, I want to continue to be a leader for the guys who are on the line with me.”
One reason Tuerk is so well-equipped to be a leader of the offensive line is his incredible versatility.
He has started at all five positions on the line in his career, and thus has the ability to fill in for any one of his teammates as well as mentor any one of the younger linemen he plays with.
Tuerk has also stepped up as a leader during the third offensive line coaching change in his USC career for the Trojans after last year’s offensive line coach, Tim Drevno, left USC to become the offensive coordinator for Jim Harbaugh at Michigan.
The team brought in 20-year coaching veteran Bob Connelly from Oklahoma State as his replacement.
Connelly has stepped in and made an immediate impact on the talented group of linemen, and has garnered approval from his senior captain.
“Coach Connelly is awesome,” Tuerk said. “He’s a great coach, a great teacher, and he definitely has a lot of passion and really cares about us. He helps us every single day with our technique, toughness and attitude.”
The smooth transition is not only a positive for Tuerk and his offensive line mates, but also figures to be a great thing for Tuerk’s roommate and close friend, quarterback and fellow captain Cody Kessler.
The two have a close relationship off the field, which undoubtedly factors into their chemistry on the field
“Cody’s a great guy, a great quarterback,” Tuerk said. “We communicate really well. I send the ball to him every single play, so it definitely helps that we have a close relationship.”
Tuerk snapping to Kessler will mark the start of a 2015 campaign in which Tuerk has identified a goal that stands above the rest in his mind and the minds of his teammates: to win the Pac-12 championship.
The team expects to take the first step toward that goal on Saturday at the Coliseum against Arkansas State. Max is confident that he and his teammates will be ready to go, thanks in large part to second year head coach Steve Sarkisian.
“Coach Sark definitely knows how to get guys pumped up,” Tuerk said. “He’s an awesome coach, and I really enjoy playing for him. He’s a great offensive mind, really smart, and he’s really relatable. Guys really really like him in the locker room.”
Though Saturday will mark Tuerk’s final “first game of the season” in a Trojan uniform, there is little doubt that he is ready to seize the moment.
As the starting center and senior captain for one the nation’s top programs, Tuerk will provide a calming presence as the anchor for a team looking to explode back into the upper rankings of college football. It’s time for one final go around, and Tuerk is ready.

After an offseason full of storylines, redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler and company are looking to take control of the Pac-12 and play for a national title. The road to a championship starts on Saturday, when the No. 8 Trojans open their season against Arkansas State in the Coliseum.
The Red Wolves finished 7-6 last season, though they are usually a conference title contender in the Sun Belt. It marked the first time the team had won fewer than eight games in a season since 2010.
The Trojans finished 9-4 last season, a disappointing record for a school with the football prowess of USC. Though the Trojans showed a lot of promise, they also displayed an inability to finish games, losing to unranked Boston College early in the season.
Though USC is favored to cruise to victory given the strength of the Pac-12 versus that of the Sun Belt, these two teams share a lot of things in common.
This is the first season since 2010 that Arkansas State has been able to retain a head coach for two consecutive years. Blake Anderson will return for his second season after former head coaches Hugh Freeze, Gus Malzahn and Bryan Harsin departed for Ole Miss, Auburn and Boise State, respectively.
Like Anderson, Trojans head coach Steve Sarkisian is returning for his second season at Troy after finishing 9-4 last season. Both head coaches have a lot to prove in their second seasons with less than favorable records to improve on.
Another similarity the teams share is the leadership and experience at the quarterback position. USC will be led by a quarterback in Kessler who, thanks to his impressive numbers last season, is already receiving Heisman buzz.
Kessler completed just shy of 70 percent of his passes last season for 3,826 yards. He threw for 39 touchdown passes compared to just five interceptions.
The Red Wolves will be led by second-year starter, senior Fredi Knighten. Like Kessler, Knighten had a single-digit pick count, throwing 24 touchdown passes to seven interceptions on 3,200 total yards in 2014. Knighten also had 800 rushing yards and an additional 11 rushing touchdowns last season. Though there is no Heisman buzz surrounding Knighten, he is a preseason All-Sun Belt Conference first-team selection.
Knighten is the type of versatile quarterback that the Trojans struggled to subdue last season.
Much like Arizona quarterback Anu Solomon and former UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley, Knighten can do as much damage on the run as he can with his arm.
He will lead an up-tempo Red Wolves attack that averaged 476.5 yards in total offense last season. Senior running back Michael Gordon rushed for 1,100 yards and 13 touchdowns last year as well and will be joined by a trio of dynamic wide receivers in Tres Houston, Dijon Paschal and JD McKissic.
“[They have a ] very explosive offense, [play] up tempo, and really go after you,” Sarkisian said.
The Trojan defense especially struggled in the fourth quarter last season, but that can likely be attributed to the lack of depth caused by a reduced number of scholarships. Though the Trojans will be without Leonard Williams, linebacker Su’a Cravens and cornerback Adoree’ Jackson headline a strong defense.
If Knighten and his offense play to their ability, however, the Trojans could have their hands full with such a versatile quarterback.
The Red Wolves will need to rely on their offensive production, as the defense allowed 27.8 points per game last season and will likewise have their hands full with Kessler and an experienced USC offense.
Sarkisian isn’t underestimating the Red Wolves’ defense one bit, though.
“I’ve been extremely impressed with how hard they play defensively and how hard they run to the football,” Sarkisian said. “This is a team that is a very, very scary one.”
Kessler will be joined by sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who had a breakout year as a true freshman in 2014.
“Saturday’s going to be a blast,” Kessler said. “I’m already pumped.”
Smith-Schuster will become the number one target at wide receiver since the former number one Nelson Agholor was drafted by the Eagles in the 2015 NFL Draft. Running backs Tre Madden and Justin Davis also add a lot of talent to Kessler’s arsenal.
Newly appointed play-caller and offensive coordinator Clay Helton should have no problem adjusting to his new role as the Trojans return 16 starters from last season.
“Clay Helton has such a good handle of our offense right now,” Sarkisian said.
The Trojans are heavily favored to win Saturday’s matchup but can’t sleep on a mobile quarterback like Knighten.
The Trojans are favored to finish first in the Pac-12 while the Red Wolves are picked to finish third in the Sun Belt conference.
As the team heads into its season debut, Kessler commended the team’s preparation, especially the younger players, over the course of fall camp and practice this past week.
“The maturity of this team and these freshman is unbelievable,” Kessler said. “We play at a high level and guys my age hold them to those standards, but they’ve had a great willingness to learn from the older guys.”
Kessler and the Trojans will try and start the season on the right foot come their Saturday night showdown with the Red Wolves.
First kickoff is set for 8 p.m.

Mark Jackson, senior associate director of Athletics, and Julia Plotts, associate professor of clinical finance and business economics at the Marshall School of Business, are using GPS tracking devices on football players to reduce injuries.
The two are implementing GPS analytics for the football program starting this weekend.
Plotts took students to Australia in 2009 for the Learning About International Commerce program, where they visited the Sydney Swans, an Australian Football League team that was using GPS devices.
Plotts saw the significance of using the GPS technology for football at USC after reviewing the Australian team’s data analytics. She reported her findings to Marshall Dean James G. Ellis who then connected her to Jackson.
Catapult, the company that created the GPS technology, utilizes advanced technology to track player movement and help prevent further injury.
The GPS is a performance measuring tool. It documents about 1,000 data points per second for multiple aspects of player movement. Catapult’s product can also present recovery time, collecting the data and displays it in a way coaches can use it to improve their practice regiment.
Earlier this year, a deal was reached with Catapult in order to use its GPS devices on the USC football team.
Danny van Dijk, a strength and conditioning intern, pitched the need for the use of this device.
“More than anything, GPS technology prepares us to better manage our athletes and plan our training week,” Dijk told USC News.
Six years later, in early 2015, Jackson flew to Australia to see the technology himself. The trip showed him that the technology was a viable addition to the team.
“It measures maximum velocity, player load, how much you push out your left foot … everything,” Jackson told USC News. “You have real numbers at the end of every practice.”
This device will not replace coaching, but it is predicted to enhance the team’s player analytics.
Players will be wearing this new GPS device at the first regular season game against Arkansas State this Saturday.
This story implies that USC is an early adopter.  Not really.  Florida State was.  Alabama was at least 1.5 years ahead of USC.  
USC had the most obvious need for the devices, because of the sanctions, and the need to avoid injuries, but took no action then.  
Well, here is one of the next interesting sports tech idea:  virtual reality training for QBs.  If there is concern that Max Browne may not get enough snaps to be ready to play, USC should look into this technology to assist his development.  Darnold as well.
Needless to say, Kessler could employ it to prepare for games.  
I wonder if USC has even looked into this technology?  I’m taking predictions for when USC finally starts using it.

USC hosted the John Ruskin Art Club, the oldest arts and cultural association in Los Angeles, Thursday night at Doheny Library for a lecture on the club’s founder, John Ruskin.
“This is really our home,” said club president Gabriel Meyer, before the lecture. “The Ruskin Art Club was involved with USC since 1905 so we go back a long way with USC. Many of the wives of the founders of USC were a part of the Ruskin Art Club and established a deep connection there. More recently, we donated our historic archives to the USC special collections, and we are very proud to have them here.”
The lecture, given by Cambridge professor and noteworthy Ruskin expert Clive Wilmer, dramatized the ways in which Ruskin’s sociological ideals are still applicable today. Ruskin’s articles, which praised English artist J. M. W. Turner’s paintings as “true” art, persuaded audiences that nature is wonderful and that people should pay attention to it to save it.
“He claimed that such industrial capitalism was taking over and destroying the world,”  Wilmer said. “How the skies are darkening. How there is more and more pollution in the air. How the snow is melting. Sound familiar?”
Ruskin, who is largely associated with the “Arts and Crafts” movement that grew out of his writing, is highly influential in the United States. Ruskin lived in Manchester, England, which was then regarded as the center of Britain’s newly acquired wealth and site of mass poverty and social stratification as a result of factories of the Industrial Revolution.
Wilmer said that 150 years ago, John Ruskin was trying to tell his audience that the world was falling apart and no one was paying attention. Ruskin said that like painting, where the message is inseparable from the medium, the language of poetry cannot be understood without the words and the rhythms. Rather than simply dictionary definitions, meaning is a matter of context, sound and rhythm.
Ruth Weisberg, professor of fine arts at USC, said she aims to carry out Ruskin’s vision through her classes at USC.
“The actual work is physical work done in a way that harkens back 500 years ago,” Weisberg said. “I teach drawing based on observation and based on apprehension of form and the poetry of the visual. I do not deny imagination, but I want the hand that is trained.”
“Many people believe in the term “deskilling” but it is very important to me that we are still teaching students based on observation and training one’s hand and eye,” she said. “Giving them something so real and enduring. And I am very proud that will continue here at USC.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated Professor Jim Spaces gave the lecture.  Spaces introduced the main lecturer, Clive Wilmer. It also stated that Ruskin was active 300 years ago. He was active 150 years ago. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.
Thanks for the coverage of the first Ruskin Lecture to be held at the Doheny Library.  We plan to make this an annual event, continuing the USC Libraries collaboration with the Ruskin Art Club that began with the donation of its archives to Special Collections.
I have two corrections to the article:
The distinguished lecturer last evening was actually Professor Clive Wilmer, a prominent Ruskin scholar, poet, and Master of St. George Guild, a charity founded by John Ruskin in 1871.  Professor Spaces provided an eloquent introduction to Mr. Wilmer’s talk.
John Ruskin was active in England in the mid-19th century, about 150 years ago.
