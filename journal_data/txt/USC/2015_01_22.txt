After making it through four years of harsh sanctions that included a two-year postseason ban and a loss of 30 scholarships, the USC football team thought it was ready to move on and start a new era.
That is until last Friday, when the NCAA announced that it would be restoring 112 formerly vacated wins to Joe Paterno and the Penn State Nittany Lions. This announcement came less than a year after the NCAA lifted Penn State’s four-year bowl ban after just two years and restored full scholarships for the program starting in 2015.
You’ve got to be kidding me.
Restoring the scholarships and allowing postseason play is one thing -— the current players had nothing to do with the horrible injustices that took place in Penn State facilities years ago -— but restoring wins to a man who hid these atrocities is flat-out wrong.
Initially, NCAA President Mark Emmert came down hard on the storied football program. Following the arrest of former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky for sexual misconduct with minors that took place at Penn State facilities, Emmert handed the Nittany Lions a four-year bowl ban, took away 40 scholarships over the next five years and mandated that the university pay $60 million to charities and foundations that advocate for young children who are victims of sexual abuse.
After two short years, the NCAA Infractions Committee had a change of heart, restoring scholarships and lifting the postseason ban. Now with the NCAA restoring Paterno’s wins, Emmert will need to answer a lot of questions.
Every USC fan reading this column is asking the same question: how could a program that hid sexual misconduct get off easier than us?
First off, USC was rightly punished for what happened some 10 years ago. Under Pete Carroll, USC’s administration became too easygoing and often looked the other way when it came to a winning football program. However, the NCAA tried to use the Trojans as an example to help prevent other schools from following suit.
The NCAA handed down a two-year postseason ban and a loss of 30 scholarships over three years on the Trojans, thinking they would see nothing worse. Well, they were wrong. Drastically wrong. And instead of handing out similar punishments for worse crimes, the NCAA has done the exact opposite.
By the time the sanctions finally ended this past season, USC had watched the NCAA basically slap the wrists of other universities that committed infractions much worse than the Trojans.
Ohio State only faced a one-year bowl ban after it was proven that quarterback Terrelle Pryor took benefits for memorabilia. The University of Miami was only given a reduction of nine scholarships over three years after a former booster admitted that he paid players in the early 2000s.
Athletic Director Pat Haden appealed to the NCAA Infractions Committee on multiple occasions to no avail, and he let his displeasure be known following the Penn State decision.
“Well, it’s too late,” Haden said.  “At this point, I know USC fans and I feel this way, too, when we see other programs around the country get relief or less penalty than we received, you feel abused and upset.”
The NCAA restoring 112 wins to Penn State is really just the icing on the cake.
The two situations are almost incomparable. This decision only highlights the troubles in college athletics’ governing board.
There might be some closure later this month when a judge is set to rule on a case involving former running backs coach Todd McNair, in which the NCAA is accused of concealing emails that suggest they made up evidence. I suggest every USC student pay attention to the decision set for Feb. 2.
So while news of Penn State’s wins being reinstated might bring out old feelings, it is time for USC to move on.
Nick Barbarino is a junior majoring in business administration. His column “Beyond the Arc” runs Fridays.
Blame Haden’s feckless appeasement strategy. USC’s Hollywood charm offensive had them laughing their heads off at NCAA headquarters. The school was the embodiment of “Fight On” simply rolled over. 
“First off, USC was rightly punished for what happened some 10 years ago. Under Pete Carroll, USC’s administration became too easygoing and often looked the other way when it came to a winning football program.”
I can’t believe I just read that. “Rightly punished”? Really? Do you even go here? I’m truly flabbergasted by this column.
Just like our weak kneed President and A.D.
Millennial “Trojans” don’t Fight On, they lodge a complaint and roll over.
Thank God the Football Team is immune from this malaise.
“Ohio State only faced a one-year bowl ban after it was proven that quarterback Terrelle Pryor took benefits for memorabilia.”  
That is innacurate. You need to check why Ohio St. received a bowl ban and the other punishments besides the ban.

After a tough outing in the Southern California USTA Pro Futures, the USC men’s tennis team returned to its winning ways with a dominant showing at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup. The team followed up that performance with a commanding 6-1 victory over UC Riverside on Monday, giving the team some momentum heading into the ITA Kick-Off this weekend.
In the Sherwood Collegiate Cup singles competition, the Trojans were strongly represented with nine entrants. Sophomore Nick Crystal, senior Jonny Wang, senior Roberto Quiroz and freshman Thibault Forget swept their first-round matches, while both sophomore Rob Bellamy and junior Max de Vroome won their opening matches in three sets to advance to the second round. Freshman Tanner Smith and sophomore Connor Farren failed to advance to the second round after both of them were swept in their first match. Senior Eric Johnson, despite winning the first set in his opening match, was also eliminated from competition after losing the second and third sets of the match.
Of the six Trojans that advanced to the second round, only Quiroz and Wang would make it to the quarterfinals. Quiroz’s second round matchup against Vince Schneider of Baylor started rough for Quiroz, who lost 2-6 to Schneider in the first set. Quiroz fought back, however, and easily won the next two sets by scores of 6-2 and 6-1 to win the match. Wang also needed three sets to move on to the quarterfinals when he took on Karue Sell from UCLA in the second round. Wang won the first set 6-3, but dropped the second set to Sell 2-6. Despite his troubles in the second set, Wang took control in the third and final set, winning the set 6-1 and punching his ticket to the quarterfinals. Bellamy’s singles play came to an end when he was swept 4-6, 5-7 in his second round matchup. Crystal, Forget, and de Vroome failed to advance to the quarterfinals after each of them lost their respective second round matches in three sets.
In the quarterfinals, Quiroz and Wang dominated their competition, with both of them sweeping their respective opponents. Felipe Rios from Baylor gave Quiroz a tough fight, but Quiroz was able to finish the job in the first and second sets, winning 6-4, 7-6 (4) and earning a spot in the semifinals. Wang didn’t have too much trouble in his quarterfinals matchup, beating Mate Zsiga from Baylor 6-1, 6-2.
Quiroz and Wang were pitted against each other in the semifinals. Quiroz swept his fellow teammate 6-2, 6-3 en route to the championship match, where he took on UCLA’s Dennis Mkrtchian. In the championship match, Quiroz made things look easy, sweeping Mkrtchian 6-2, 6-0 and claiming the Sherwood Collegiate Cup singles title.
Quiroz said it was a big moment for him when he won the Sherwood Collegiate Cup.
“For me, it’s a very important accomplishment,”Quiroz said. “Sherwood is such a traditional tournament. Being able to win the tournament is unbelievable and even more [because] I’m a senior. But you know what, I wasn’t feeling great last week, but I just tried to give my best… I never gave up and I just kept building every match, and I think that was key to my success. And, you know, I’m very happy, but I’m more motivated to work harder and give my best to the team.”
In doubles action, the Trojans were well represented with four teams. Smith and Wang enjoyed a first-round bye, while the other three USC pairings competed in the opening round. Quiroz and de Vroome advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-1 win over UCLA’s Michael Guzman and Ryoto Tachi, while Bellamy and Farren moved on with a 6-4 win over UCLA’s Austin Rapp and Mkrtxchian. The pairing of Crystal and Forget, who lost 1-6 to Baylor’s Julian Lenz and Rios, was the only USC pairing that did not advance to the quarterfinals.
In the quarterfinals, two of the three remaining USC pairings won their matchups and continued to the semifinals. Quiroz and de Vroome advanced to the semifinals via a walkover, while Smith and Wang took down Juan Benitez and Zsiga from Baylor by a score of 6-3 to continue on in the competition. Bellamy and Farren were eliminated from doubles play after a heartbreaking 6-7 (4) loss to Tom Fawcett and Maciek Romanowicz of Stanford.
Like the singles semifinals, the doubles semifinals pitted the two remaining USC competitors against each other. Quiroz and de Vroome shut out Smith and Wang 6-0 to advance to the finals. In the championship game, Quiroz and de Vroome fell to Fawcett and Romanowicz 4-6, finishing second in the doubles tournament.
The team returned to Marks Stadium on Monday, where they took on the UC Riverside Highlanders (UCR). In doubles play, the Trojans were unable to pull out a victory.  Michael Carella and Calvin Ngo (UCR) defeated Bellamy and Forget 6-4, while Luis Gaståo and Sean Robles (UCR) defeated redshirt freshman David Laser and Smith 6-2 to clinch the doubles point. Crystal and Farren were up 5-3 over Julian Ruffin and Sina Sharifi before play was suspended.
Bellamy shared his thoughts on why he believed his team did so poorly in doubles action. “There were two new pairings: myself and Thibault,” said Bellamy. “We had never played before, and so that was interesting. And the guys on Court 3, David and Tanner, had also never played before. With doubles, it just takes a lot of getting used to, knowing what your partner’s going to do and kind of understanding each other. It’s also the first dual match of the season, so there’s some nerves.”
Losing the doubles point would not matter, however, as the Trojans dominated singles play, winning all six of their matches. Johnson and Crystal both took down their respective UCR opponents by a score of 6-1, 6-1.  Farren defeated Sharifi 6-2, 6-2, while Forget earned a 6-1, 6-3 win over Robles. Bellamy reigned victorious in a 6-4, 6-1 win over Carella, and Smith outlasted Hans Baumstark 7-5, 6-4. With the six victories, the Trojans won the meet 6-1 and are now officially 1-0 on the season.
USC men’s tennis coach Peter Smith talked about how this match was different from the Southern California USTA Pro Futures and what he did to get his team back into winning form.  “The tournament we played was really, really tough two weeks ago,” said Smith. “It’s very hard to compare that to today’s match [against UC Riverside]. We needed to get together, and we needed to work hard and train. It’s that simple.”
Following the Southern California USTA Pro Futures, Smith said that his team needed to focus on footwork. After the match against UC Riverside, Smith talked about the improvements he has seen in that area. “We had the energy out here [against UC Riverside] and that translates to footwork,” said Smith. “You know, just an aggressive mindset, and working super hard and moving your feet.  We saw that, and it’ll just get better and better.”
This weekend, the Trojans will be hosting a two-day tournament at Marks Stadium with UNC Wilmington, Santa Clara and Louisiana-Lafayette for the ITA Kick-Off Weekend. On Friday, UNC Wilmington will take on Santa Clara in the morning, while the Trojans will take on Louisiana-Lafayette in the early afternoon. The loser from each of the two games will play a consolation match Saturday afternoon, and the winners from Friday’s games will play in the championship game Saturday evening.
UNC Wilmington is 2-0 on the season with 7-0 wins against both Appalachian State and Gardner-Webb. In fact, UNC Wilmington, which is ranked No. 50 nationally, didn’t lose a set in either match. The freshmen will be a key factor for UNC Wilmington this weekend, considering there are six of them on the team.
Santa Clara, like UNC Wilmington, is 2-0 so far this season. Santa Clara, which has taken on UC Santa Cruz and Sonoma State, won both of its matches by a score of 4-0 and never gave up a set. Santa Clara consists of only seven players, but is ranked No. 56 nationally.
Louisiana-Lafayette has a 2-2 record on the season. Three of those four games were played during the Florida State Invitational, where Louisiana Lafayette went 2-1.  Their only loss in the tournament came against No. 72 North Florida by a score of 0-4. Louisiana-Lafayette rebounded and won the next two matches against Furman and South Alabama by scores of 4-2 and 4-3, respectively. In Louisiana-Lafayette’s last match, they fell to Lamar 3-4.

After a tough loss to UCLA, the USC women’s basketball team carries on as it faces Bay Area contenders California (12-5, 4-2 Pac-12) and Stanford (13-5, 5-1 Pac-12) this weekend.
The Golden Bears, who thrashed Arizona (7-10, 0-6 Pac-12) and lost to Arizona State (17-1, 6-0 Pac-12) last weekend, will visit the Women of Troy first on Friday. Forward Reshanda Gray leads the Golden Bears with 19 points per game, and guard Brittany Boyd is averaging 13 points per game and 7.9 rebounds. Gray and Boyd make up two of the three starters who played a role in the Golden Bears’ trip to the second round in the NCAA tournament last season.
“They’re well coached, they play hard, and then they have some strong pieces, so we’re going to have to play well, we’re going to have to play hard and execute,” said head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. “I think execution, offensively and defensively, is going to be key for us this weekend.”
Both Cal and USC took turns beating each other on their home courts last season. The Women of Troy conquered the Bears in Haas Pavilion, 77-70. Cal struck back, however, and rolled on USC in the Galen Center, 76-67.  USC knows the Bears have a dominating presence in the paint and plan to tame their fast-break points.
“Communication is key with Cal because they like to run out. We need to make sure we know who we’re getting in transition, who’s stopping the ball, who’s getting back,” said junior guard Brianna Barrett.
Senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama is excited to see Barrett go against Cal’s Boyd. Vaioletama has good knowledge of Boyd’s game and considers the Golden Bears to be a fast, “run and gun” team.
“Making it difficult in the beginning for her [Boyd] would help us,” Vaioletama said. “The guards are going to have to keep her in front, and if they get beat, they’re going to have to rely on the post players to come over and help.”
The Stanford Cardinal are third in the Pac-12 conference. Like Cal, they defeated Arizona but were chopped down by Arizona State on Monday. Guards Lili Thompson and Amber Orrange lead Stanford with 15 points and 12 points per game, respectively. Though Stanford swept the Women of Troy last regular season, USC upset them in the 2014 Pac-12 tournament.
“We beat Stanford last year to get to the championship, that was the semifinals,” said Vaioletama. “For them it’s keeping their poise and running the offense. Stanford has always had a great program.”
Last Sunday against UCLA, Vaioletama earned 17 points and 12 rebounds, achieving her fourth career double-double. Freshman guard McKenzie Calvert played her part by scoring 12 points and two assists.
The Bruins and the Women of Troy switched the lead throughout the match. Deep in the second half, the Bruins made a pair of free throws that gave them the lead. This was the beginning of the end, as USC went scoreless for the rest of the game. UCLA ultimately won, 71-60.
Cooper-Dyke said the team must play together on both ends of the floor in order to be tough.
“Our strength is our balance in scoring when we share the ball, our athletic ability to get up and down the court and play one-on-one basketball,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We’re a young team and we’re still a work in progress,”
USC hosts Cal on Friday at 7 p.m. PST and will play the Cardinal on Sunday at 5 p.m. PST in the Galen Center.

When the going gets weird, the weird turns prosaic.
There was a time when Johnny Depp was considered the embodiment of offbeat cool, a chameleonic trickster god with the ability to inhabit the weary bodies and restless souls of a seemingly endless caravan of lonely outcasts and loveable eccentrics.
From the wistful whimsy of Edward Scissorhands to the drug-fueled dementia of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to the riveting realism of Donnie Brasco, the movies Depp starred in were never box office behemoths; they were intensely personal works of unencumbered outsider art. Then, sometime after the gargantuan success of Alice in Wonderland in 2010, the most versatile leading man of his generation got lost in the costume department, and things took a turn for the corny.
Many pop culture commentators will tell you the actor’s fall from grace actually started well before his trip down the rabbit hole. It has become fashionable to blame Gore Verbinski’s bloated but undeniably entertaining Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy for instigating Depp’s metamorphosis from serious actor to blockbuster gun-for-hire, but that accusation is wide of the mark.
Depp continued turning in compelling, identifiably human performances in films such as Finding Neverland, The Libertine and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street throughout the Disney franchise’s initial run, earning three Oscar nominations in the process (including one for The Curse of the Black Pearl). He might have picked up some bad habits on the Pirates set — mugging for the camera, using makeup and prosthetics as security blankets — but he still appeared fully invested in every role.
Besides, Depp’s rum-guzzling, vaguely fey Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the most iconic cinematic creations of our young century, one who has earned his place in the same action hero pantheon as Indiana Jones and James Bond, characters whose appeal transcends sequel fatigue.
It was the abortive follow-up creations — the break-dancing Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland, the kooky blueblood vampire Barnabas in Dark Shadows, the monosyllabic, birdseed-munching Tonto in The Lone Ranger — that truly smacked of boredom and even flagrant self-parody. These sad creatures, each containing some of Captain Jack’s DNA but none of his salty dog soul, are eerily reminiscent of the failed Ellen Ripley clones in Alien: Resurrection — unfinished grotesqueries, never meant to see the light of day.
Recent years have seen the actor hit a series of new professional lows. He sleepwalked his way past Angelina Jolie in The Tourist, an utterly charmless romantic comedy that found him unable to recite even the simplest dialogue without the aid of an e-cigarette as an omnipresent prop. He saw his star power fade to critical levels in last spring’s sci-fi clunker Transcendence. He singlehandedly derailed Kevin Smith’s body horror comedy Tusk the moment he showed up as an obnoxious, Clouseau-esque Canadian detective. He even appeared (uncredited, to his infinite credit) in Adam Sandler’s comedy death march Jack and Jill, no doubt to share in the misery of his Donnie Brasco co-star Al Pacino. Only Rango, The Rum Diary and a surprise cameo in the first 21 Jump Street movie provided occasional glimmers of the man who once played Z movie maven Ed Wood with such manic joie de vivre.
This brings us to Depp’s latest effort, director David Koepp’s capering crime comedy Mortdecai, which is being released in the doldrums of January (usually a bad sign) and was not screened in advance for critics (usually an even worse sign). The film, based on a series of picaresque comic thrillers written by English author Kyril Bonfiglioli, features Depp as the eponymous Mortdecai, an unscrupulous art dealer and bon vivant who prizes his own carefully maintained curlicue mustache above any rare painting or sculpture on earth.
The plot kicks in when Mortdecai’s old friend Inspector Martland (Ewan McGregor) offers the dissolute aristocrat financial compensation for his assistance in recovering a stolen painting that might contain the code to a bank vault filled with Nazi gold. Despite an intriguingly old school premise and the presence of Jeff Goldblum, Gwyneth Paltrow and Paul Bettany, the movie, which cost $60 million, is not expected to do well in theaters, with analysts estimating a weekend gross of less than $9 million.
So what can Depp do to regain his credibility, both as an actor and a reliable box office draw? The latter is simple enough: new installments of Pirates and Alice in Wonderland are already in development, and both are bound to rake in millions due to brand recognition alone. The former is a slightly trickier proposition. One way would be to ditch the wigs, the contact lenses and the funky headgear and start playing real human beings again. The good news? He’s already booked a project that fits the bill rather nicely.
Scott Cooper’s upcoming crime drama Black Mass will feature Depp as Whitey Bulger, the real-life Boston gangster who became an FBI informant in a desperate bid to wipe out his competition. The film, which boasts a powerhouse cast including Benedict Cumberbatch, Sienna Miller and Kevin Bacon, is expected to hit theaters this September. Bulger, the real-life inspiration for Jack Nicholson’s vicious crime lord in The Departed, is the exact kind of role Depp should be pursuing right now, a part that could potentially allow him to break free of the costume department and reclaim his title as one of the leading actors of his generation.

Shirin, the protagonist of Appropriate Behavior, never seems to quite figure out what it is she wants. Desiree Akhavan, who wrote and directed the film on top of starring as the eternally frustrated Shirin, plays a 20-something Iranian-American woman who is dealing with a bad breakup from her girlfriend and a traditional family that is not aware that she is bisexual.
The story in Appropriate Behavior is nothing new — the market is flooded with stories of lost millennials trying to figure out what to do with their lives. With shows like Girls and Broad City finding recent success, characters like these have become very familiar to audiences. Appropriate Behavior manages to find just enough originality to merit a watch, but much of it will feel very familiar.
Unsurprisingly, given her roles as writer and director, Akhavan’s character is the sole focus of the film. She is in every single scene, which allows for a very full picture of Shirin to emerge. The script might be very self-centered, but Akhavan does not attempt to justify or hide her character’s faults. Shirin’s irrational behavior and mistakes are out in the open, leading to an illuminating portrait of the complex character.
Shirin’s troubles mostly arise from her attempt to inhabit two very different worlds: her life as a young bisexual woman in Brooklyn and a strong connection to her traditional Persian family.
The Brooklyn portion of the film feels like very old hat. Make no mistake, it is well done. The direction is clean and direct, and the dialogue is, for the most part, very natural. Akhavan clearly has a love of one-liners, which for the most part make her characters come across as clever (though some of the lines fall flat). Shirin’s time in Brooklyn, though presented with a steady hand, is not exceptional. She meets Maxine, an intriguing woman played with a lot of nuance by Rebecca Henderson, falls in love with her, breaks up with her, then tries to get her back. It is tried and true.
One interesting device that Akhavan uses to give the tired story a spark is a non-chronological timeline. The story jumps back and forth from the beginning of Shirin’s relationship with Maxine to the end. A non-linear timeline is also nothing new, but it is a good choice in this instance. Offering the viewer a juxtaposition between two periods in Shirin’s life adds the element of time to the experience.
The other portion of the film, which focuses on Shirin’s dealings with her family, is what truly elevates the film over its retread of a main story. Though it occupies much less running time, this arc provides a lot more compelling content. Shirin’s troubles dealing with her family, whose values and priorities are very different from her own, have a sheen of truth to them, as Akhavan’s personal experiences obviously influenced the writing of those scenes. One particularly charming scene involves Shirin taking her father aside to criticize her brother while, unbeknownst to her, her brother is doing the same exact thing in the other room, criticizing her to her mother. The scene is played for laughs, but it packs a punch ,especially because it feels so real. Another poignant scene is when Shirin brings Maxine to a Persian New Year party under the pretense of being her “white friend.” The awkward interactions with her cousins and her parents have the look of moments taken directly from Akhavan’s memory. The balance in the film would have been upset if the ratio had been swung too far in the other direction, but it certainly looks like the film could have greatly benefited many more of these scenes.
Shirin’s parents and brother are all expertly cast. Her mother, played by Anh Duong, is a scene-stealer in her limited screen time. Her character is very fleshed-out and provides a powerful touch in one of the most important scenes of the film. The brother, played by Arian Moayed, does not pack the emotional punch that Duong’s character does, but Moayed plays his part well, especially in the aforementioned scene in which the siblings are complaining to their parents.
The real breakout star of the film, however, is Henderson. She portrays Maxine with a soft touch. The character has to go from hard and confrontational to emotionally vulnerable at the drop of a hat, and Henderson takes the curves like a pro. Acting next to her, Akhavan suffers. The understanding is that at least substantial parts of Shirin are drawn from Akhavan’s own life, so she definitely knows how to play this character. Akhavan’s mopey cavalcade of angst, however, gets old after a while, and she is ultimately upstaged by her more energetic castmates.
To write, direct and act in a film is a very ambitious undertaking, and though Akhvan created flashes of brilliance with Appropriate Behavior, the film stays firmly grounded in places the audience knows all too well.

Between Vice President Joe Biden’s unpredictably awesome facial expressions and Speaker of the House John Boehner’s predictably orange skin tone, watching President Barack Obama’s sixth State of the Union with no sound wouldn’t be the worst way to spend a Tuesday evening. If you watched the speech with volume, here’s my assessment of the speech’s main themes, using the college letter grade scheme.
Linyan Tian | Daily Trojan
The Message: A-
Following their defeat in the most recent midterm elections, the Democrats were in need of a serious identity boost. In the State of the Union, Obama crafted a cohesive vision for the Democratic Party based on populist notions like redistributing wealth via higher capital gains taxes. This message is perhaps too radical to attract a general election electorate, but Obama’s speech attempted to cast those populist notions in a more moderate light by connecting them to lower taxes for the middle class and investments in each child’s education.
Obama’s poise and humor reminded me that the same Obama who inspired the nation in 2008 with a charismatic message of “hope and change” is back. When Obama noted that he “had no more campaigns left to run,” he sent a clear signal that he is moving into legacy mode. Though he went on to outline an extensive congressional wish list, of which we can expect little progress, Obama balanced that message with an eagerness to “go it alone” and move the nation forward.
Minus half a letter grade for setting the record for the most veto threats (four) in any presidential address to Congress in history. The constant veto threat undermined the otherwise well-outlined vision of working with Congress in a post-partisan era, a vision that is important for the future of American politics.
Domestic Policy: A
The economy’s recovery has become the very welcome elephant in the room for the Democrats, and the sooner they start talking about it, the better. The President touted the creation of 11 million private sector jobs (to the tune of 250,000 new jobs per month in 2014), and correctly linked the gains of Wall Street with Main Street. Gas prices, for example, are at record lows, and the Energy Information Administration projects that the average family will save $750 at the pump this year.
Obama also made a number of smaller but important mentions. Climate change certainly could have used more than two minutes, but in an already time-pressed speech the president was smart to remind Americans that 2014 was the warmest year on record. He gets extra style points for his gutsy attack on the Keystone pipeline, and ridicule of climate deniers who say they aren’t scientists — the most prominent of which is Boehner, who made headlines for his famously silly “I am not a scientist”-esque quip last year.
For the first time in a State of the Union, the president explicitly recognized, and used the words, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people. He also renewed his push for guaranteeing women equal pay in the labor force. It is undeniable that the Obama era will be remembered as one of the most prolific for equality among marginalized groups in history.
Foreign Policy: C-
If you thought you were reading a column where a liberal college student sucked up to Obama and gave him nothing but As, think again.
Obama failed to conclusively indict North Korea for succeeding in de facto (albeit temporary) censorship of the Sony movie The Interview. The country is believed to be connected to the massive hack and leak of classified information from Sony, and threats of violence from the hacker group led the studio to pull the film from major theater chains. In the wake of such gross attacks on free speech, the world also bore witness to the Charlie Hebdo massacre. Obama should have offered to the global audience a robust defense of freedom of the press and made a commitment to punish those who would seek to reduce that right, be they rogue nations or terrorists.
Obama’s most terrifying request came when he called on Congress to pass a “resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.” Such an authorization would be the ultimate regression to Bush-era policies. The 2001 AUMF passed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks laid the groundwork for the very decade of war and expenditure that quickly surpassed its original purpose and continues to justify executive actions like drone strikes. Ironically, Obama touted ending that very decade of war at the beginning of his speech.
Such a recommendation is a blemish upon a speech that was otherwise a much-needed and prolific reminder that the state of the union is indeed strong.
Nathaniel Haas is a junior majoring in political science and economics. His column, “State of the Union,” runs Fridays. 
With all due respect, Obama’s speech  was typical. Full of lies, deceit, lack of substance, in a costume of power and control. You don’t know this yet because you are tin the real world of life and a jib, but his policies of 6 years have destroyed this moral fa brick of this country by continually to push racial divisionist and the aligning the White House with the race baiting industry. He hangs around with a thief, drug dealer and a tax cheat. He hides behind Eric holder on failed justice. However you are getting educated on his ineffective foreign policy. 
If h I u agree with all the “free programs” that he espouses,  well, there’s trouble in River City my friend. Trouble. You will have to pay for it through continued and escalescalating high taxes. Nothing is free.
Katman: In the real world of “jibs” you may want to use spellcheck. You may also want to provide some reason for us to believe the various rhetorically inflammatory labels you’ve attached to the leader of the free world in a way that makes “willy nilly” seem rigorous. 
As for the article, I’m not sure that the indictments of Obama’s foreign policy statements are totally warranted. North Korea’s petty vendetta against a movie studio doesn’t really matter in the larger geopolitical equation; to acknowledge it in the State of the Union would likely only make North Korea seem more important than it is. As for the call for an AUMF against ISIL, it seems likely that the president will use force against the Islamic State sooner or later; he may as well have the legal authority to do it when that day comes. Still, it seems more likely that this is a political maneuver designed to put Republicans in the unenviable position of having to either seem pro-ISIL or vote to give the president more authority. 
I am not a scientist, but it was nice to see the president call climate change the greatest threat to future generations. Maybe we’ll get to the point where a president acknowledges the overwhelming consensus among people who are scientists that it’s the biggest threat to current generations.

Lately, many female feminists have claimed to attain empowerment by taking control of their nude bodies. Australian actress Caitlin Stasey recently launched a website, Herself.com, where she posts profiles of diverse, non-celebrity women. These profiles include nude photographs and interviews on topics such as sexuality, puberty, contraceptives, relationships and the media’s portrayal of women. According to Time, Stasey’s aim is for readers to “witness the female form in all its honesty without the burden of the male gaze.” Herself.com has received wide publicity and positive reviews from mainstream media outlets for educating people on what feminism entails and how feminism can be embraced in various ways.
Though many praise Stasey’s website for its progressive, liberating and educational properties, controversies can easily arise. First, while most women featured on the website provide great insight into other women’s perspectives, some of them are extreme and might confuse young readers who are still figuring out their identities. For example, Stasey herself views marriage as “an archaic institution” and monogamy as “pointless, painful and archaic.” She also points out in an interview on her website that women are “empathic, considered, honest and tactile,” opposing men’s “bias and privilege.” While Stasey is promoted as a role model for modern women, her comments might backfire against her intentions of advocating for gender equality. Instead, young readers could potentially see feminism as man-hating, which is something many feminists are trying to redefine and educate the public about.
Also, though posting consented nudity sends out a strong and powerful message about the female body, there is always a chance that readers who are not aware of the context can misunderstand the point these women are making. This can be seen more easily through other recent instances of feminists taking pictures or videos of their nude bodies.
Last February, Columbia University student Coco Young filmed an art video with Karley Sciortino, creator of the blog Slutever, showing nude female university students going through a sorority initiation. The video, “INITIATIØN,” is set in a Columbia library and features several topless girls fondling each other, using props such as raw eggs, chocolate and a blue dead chicken. According to Purple TV, the purpose of this NSFW video is to “explore the rituals of American Ivy League secret societies, to the point of hysteria, highlighting our culture’s perception of female desire.” Young told a source that the point was to critique the institution by using nudity as a hook to first attract watchers and then repulse them. Such logic and inspiration could be pretty confusing to watchers. Without some context and explanation, the video could simply be perceived as a group of standard, attractive college females going topless and exploring their sexuality. It might have been made to criticize certain sexual fetishes and fantasies. From purely watching the video, however, not only could the message fail to be received, but the watcher could also associate attractive women objectifying themselves with modern day feminism.
This is not to say that nudity should be frowned upon, but that the message should communicate the term “feminist” in a serious manner. Danish activist Emma Holten successfully showed the public how she wanted to “rehumanize” her naked body as beautiful and unshameful. Holten was a victim of revenge porn. Naked photos she took as a teenager were leaked online, and she started receiving threats and sexual harrassments from strangers on the internet. Three years later, Holten decided to start a “CONSENT Project.” This time, she took control over her own naked body and presented herself the way she wanted people to see her. Nude photos accompanied by an empowering story like this can help spread the severity of victimization and encourage more victims to share their stories.
The definition of feminism has constantly been evolving, so it is essential to portray and communicate a clear message when associating oneself with the ideology. Sexual liberation and the importance of consent have been some of the most frequently stressed issues regarding women’s rights. Therefore, expressing control over a woman’s naked body seems to be a powerful way to promote the notion of sexual identity. Nevertheless, a nude photo without the right context in the name of feminism can confuse anyone who is curious about the movement. Activists need to be careful when using nudity as a tool to express their rights and successfully educate the public about female sexuality.

A team of graduate students from the Keck School of Medicine of USC is looking forward to competing in the 2015 Hult Prize regional finals in March with an idea that focuses on bringing tutoring services to low-income urban neighborhoods.
In November, the team won the competitions quarterfinals, which included 16 teams from a wide array of disciplines at USC. It challenged student teams to come up with a solution to the pressing issue of early childhood education in poor communities.
TEACH for Tots, the business name of the winning team, included global medicine graduate students Nour Al-Timimi, Tanwe Shende, Gunnye Pak, Farah Zerehi and Narineh Ohanian. Competition sponsors included the Hult International Business School and the Clinton Global Initiative.
“Our solution for the case is something similar to having a pre-K in these urban slums. Our curriculum will take place at home by recruiting students from local communities with an emphasis on having girls as the tutors because in these areas many of them most likely don’t go to school or even have the opportunity to work and are most likely caretakers for their younger siblings,” Al-Timimi said.
Though the team lacked hands-on exposure to business cases, TEACH for Tots used group expertise on educational and global issues they have confronted both in the workforce and their studies.
Ohanian, who has been a tutor since high school, elaborated on the group’s winning strategy.
“All of the tutoring will take place in the home. Children will be broken out into groups of 1- to 3-year olds and 3- to 5-year olds,” she said. “Our tutors will work with a curriculum that is preset and meet a couple of times a week. This type of exposure to education early on in the children’s lives will be very helpful longer term in breaking the poverty cycle.”
The tutoring service will be fee-based with hopes of financial assistance from partnerships with global NGOs or other organizations willing to sponsor the cause.
The group will focus on building a base of tutors who will be seen as mentors in the community and small business owners in their own right.
“The average age of our tutors will probably be somewhere between 14 and 17 years old,” Ohanian said.  “One main challenge for us will be building trust in the community since we will be coming in as outsiders. We plan on having coordinators in the area who can help bridge that gap. Churches, for example, are very well respected in some of these communities. Our coordinators would be able to introduce our services to them who would then be able to connect us with those in need of our services.”
The competition was spearheaded by Anzal Adam, a senior majoring in accounting at the Marshall School of Business and campus director of the Hult Prize Initiative at USC. Adam was able to garner enough support from the Marshall community to get the competition recognized by the university even though she had a small window of time.
“One of my main objectives for the competition was to get students to become more conscious about social issues,” Adam said. “A lot of people are talking about participating in the next one already and with the contacts that we were able to make for this past year, I am confident that our awareness level is high and our next competition will be an even bigger success.”
The TEACH for Tots group has chosen to participate in the San Francisco regional finals because of the geographic proximity to USC. Other locations for regional finals included Boston, Shanghai, Dubai and London.
Following the regional finals, teams are selected to move to an accelerator program with an end goal of being ready to present at the final round in New York. The event will take place at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting, with the winner taking home $1 million in prize money and full operational support to launch the team’s new social enterprise.
[Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Tanwe Shende’s name. The story has been updated with the correct spelling. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
Tanwe’s last name is mispelled, it is Shende not Tende. Please correct, thanks.

Corpus Callosum, a SparkSC student organization that encourages and facilitates cooperation between the arts and sciences, held its first informational meeting Wednesday night to kick off its second year as an official campus organization.
Two brothers, Jonathan Dugan, a senior majoring in aerospace and mechanical engineering, and Brendan Dugan, a senior majoring in art, came up with the idea for Corpus Callosum in fall 2013.
The organization is aptly named for a band of fibers that allows the human brain hemispheres to share information. The organization’s main goal is to promote collaboration between art and engineering students so they can work together in constructing creative projects and participate in competitions.
“My brother and I have always wanted to work together, and we noticed that at USC there wasn’t really a space for collaborative overlap between different majors,” Brendan said. “We wanted to create a space where engineers or science majors could really get involved with the arts in a hands-on way.”
Last semester the organization was made up of about 20 active members who worked in groups on four large projects.
“Last semester we had four projects going on: a geodesic dome and a heart monitor that made an animation that progressed at the rate of your heart,” Jonathan said. “We also had a music app that uses information about a person to compose a piece of music, and a 3D-printed head mold commenting on how your cells regenerate every seven years and you become essentially a new person.”
Members of the organization also took trips and attended workshops. A group trip to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to see the James Turell and Alexander Calder exhibits contextualized real-world examples of the kind of work that Corpus Callosum facilitates. A showcase for the completed projects marked the end of the semester for the group.
Additionally, local artists have come out to show their support. “We had a local artist named Rob Reynolds come in and talk with us about a project we were working on,” Brendan said. “At the end of the semester we had a big group show that showcased the projects we had been working on throughout the semester.”
Noel Butta, a senior majoring in cognitive science and founding member of Corpus Callosum, recognized the organization’s value early.
“We hung around in a small group for about a year; we weren’t exactly sure what the club would become,” Butta said. “Soon we realized there are other people out there that are into this kind of stuff, and began to get an overwhelmingly positive response.”
Corpus Callosum provides a venue for creativity that for many students, including Brendan, seems uniquely productive.
“I’ve gained creative confidence. We are really working to get ideas off of paper and into the real world. Instead of thinking of something to do we actually do it,” Brendan said. “We have a very supportive group of people with all different skill sets who are all about creativity and getting people past the creative hurdles.”
The organization encourages students to pursue innovation outside the classroom. In this way, the organization augments academic interests and furthers creative exploration. Setting deadlines and working on an independent schedule is both challenging and rewarding for Jonathan.
“For me it’s about having a creative outlet: doing something different besides engineering,” Jonathan said. “Our project system is a little more involved than a project you might do for a class. In a school project you are looking for the grade but here we are just experimenting; the goals are different and it’s more independent.”
Midway through Corpus Callosum’s spring semester, the organization will see the addition of a conceptual showcase, as well as increased expansion into the university and Los Angeles communities.
“We are going to brainstorm new ideas, split off into groups, and take the ideas one step at a time,” Brendan said. “We are looking to partner with certain corporations to get funding. We are going to check out the art and technology museum at LACMA as well as visit an artist there named John Craig Freeman who is doing an augmented reality display that measures brainwave activity.”
According to Butta, Corpus Callosum is also involved with KXSC Fest and hoping to start a crowdsourced art installation. The future might include collaborations with other organizations within Spark SC, including 3D4E, the 3D printing club.
Jonathan and Brendan are looking forward to continuing the momentum that their organization gained over the last semester.
“It really got off the ground last semester when we got a lot more people involved,” Brendan said. “This semester we’re looking to get more exposure within the Los Angeles community.”

The Gould School of Law received a $5 million donation from Judith Hollinger to start an alternative dispute resolution program in arbitration and mediation.
Hollinger is a retired Los Angeles Superior Court and Beverly Hills Municipal Court judge. She attended USC for both her undergraduate studies and law school. The new program will be known as the Judge Judith O. Hollinger Alternative Dispute Resolution Program.
Robert Rasmussen, dean of Gould, has worked with Hollinger to help develop the new program in alternative dispute resolution.
“We were already in the midst of expanding in that area,” Rasmussen said. “And I think that really caught her fancy — just the notion that she could make a really tremendous gift to help us build out the best program of its kind in the country.”
In 2007, USC launched its cutting-edge mediation clinic, which teaches and allows students to practice arbitration and mediation skills. Both the Mediation Clinic and Advanced Mediation Clinic will be incorporated into the ADR program.
Both the clinics and the new program focus on alternative dispute resolution, which emphasizes the use of alternative tactics within the legal system to settle conflicts and avoid having to go to trial.
“We want to be a place that trains students at the highest level and that also contributes to our academic understanding of alternative dispute resolution and its effect on our legal system,” Rasmussen said.
Professor Lisa Klerman, director of the two mediation clinics, will oversee the new program. She stressed the importance of equipping law students with knowledge of alternative dispute resolution.
“It’s an increasingly important area of the law so I think that these skills are incredibly valuable, if not essential, for today’s graduates to master, given how important arbitration and mediation are becoming in the world right now,” she said.
A significant portion of legal decisions occur outside of the courtroom, without ever having to go to trial, and primarily being settled through the alternative forms of dispute resolution that will be taught through the new program.
“Something like only 1.5 percent of cases actually make it to trial and the rest have to rely on other forms of dispute resolution to be resolved,” Klerman said.
Few law schools throughout the country currently have programs dedicated to alternative dispute resolution. The study of alternative dispute resolution must take a different form than traditional aspects of legal studies, given its complex and personalized nature.
“The challenging thing about ADR is that they don’t offer opinions, like courts do. Instead, you really have to be in there, out in the world, knowing the practice, to understand what’s going on and how to be effective,” Rasmussen said.
To address this challenge, the program will feature many new classes beginning next fall, including International Arbitration, Arbitration Advocacy and Clause Drafting. Classes will be taught by both current professors and by adjunct faculty members from throughout Los Angeles. Many adjunct faculty members will be practicing Gould School of Law alumni.
“We’re tapping into some of the very best ADR professionals in the greater Los Angeles area to teach these classes, and that part is very exciting,” Klerman said.
The Gould School of Law will be hosting an event this spring to officially announce the new ADR program.
“I’m incredibly grateful to Judge Hollinger for this visionary gift. This will have an impact on current students and on students for decades to come,” Rasmussen said.
Law school ruined my life! I have no job and I have student loan debt that will follow me to my grave. Save yourself! DO NOT GO TO LAW SCHOOL.

Undergraduate Student Government officially launched election season at midnight on Wednesday when USG candidates released their campaigns through the USG elections website and via social media, primarily through Facebook.
In comparison to last year’s USG election, the elections committee has worked on improving student voter turnout, as well as clearly outlining candidate platforms. This year, as part of launching their goal to focus on voter awareness and student concerns, USG has added various pre-election events and a diversity debate to supplement the presidential debate that takes place at the end of the campaign.
Christine Hennes, USG senior director of communications, discussed specific ways in which students can get involved throughout the election process.
“The week before elections, candidates can start campaigning on campus. That is when they can begin to distribute T-shirts, flyers and signs to make themselves more visible to students on campus,” Hennes said. “Then, starting on Feb. 9, we have a ‘Vote On’ event at Tommy Trojan where students can get to know more about the candidates and more about what the roles specifically are and what they are voting on.”
Hennes also noted the creation of a funding board to aid campaign finances for candidates.
Presidential tickets for the 2015-2016 election included Rini Sampath for president, current USG vice president and her partner, Jordan Fowler for vice president, current USG director of university affairs; Ehren Elder for vice president, former Interfraternity Council executive vice president of administrative affairs, and Providence Ilisevich for president, current USG Greek senator; and Devon Manny and Sharon Oh, sophomores majoring in animation and digital art.
Fowler discussed her partnership with Sampath for the election, commenting on how thrilled she was to join her in the election.
“Rini and I have worked together in the past, so it wasn’t too shocking that Rini was asking me to join her team in some regard,” Fowler said.
Sampath discussed how her platform differs from other candidates.
“I think what really sets us apart in terms of all the tickets is that our platform is based on a lot of the work that we have already been doing and that is why our slogan itself is ‘Real Results,’” Sampath said. “You’ll see that there are some overlapping platform points, but we are the ticket that’s already been doing the work on a lot of these.”
Elder and Ilisevich join the presidential campaign with specific experience in the branch of Greek life under USG.  Elder and Ilisevich have worked together for the past nine months, discussing issues they felt were important on campus.
“In this election I am just looking forward to going to as many student groups as possible. Our slogan is ‘Because Your Voice Matters’ and we really believe that,” Elder said. “Our biggest emphasis in our platform is that while the university may have a focus on alumni and prospective students, the most important thing is today’s students and the most important thing is that the issues that matter to current students are met and that their voices our heard throughout all levels of administration.”
Manny and Oh discussed the importance of teamwork to advance policy change.
“I guess I’ve always felt like I really wanted to make an impact on places you know from a very young age,” Manny said. “Getting to USC, there are so many amazing things going on, but at the same time there are a lot of things that can be changed. We both are really strong in our beliefs that we want to have a strong impact on this school and currently there is not enough being done to make this a place what it should be at this point.”

Senior Vice President of CNN US Andrew Morse visited Wallis Annenberg Hall Wednesday evening for an open discussion about CNN logistics and the shift in journalism to online.
Led by Annenberg Director Willow Bay and Erna Smith, professor of journalism, the talk hosted Morse and alumna Wendy Brundige, CNN supervising producer. Each contributed to the hour-long conversation and took questions from students enrolled in JOUR 201: History of News in Modern America afterward.
Morse opened up the discussion by stressing how a career in journalism differs from a conventional job.
“The irony of this business, quite frankly, is that you spend often times the bulk of your career learning different skills,” Morse said. “You learn how to shoot … edit … write … produce … [and] report. With each skill set that you get, often times … that opens up different opportunities for you throughout your career. Your career often times takes turns you never expected and that’s largely happened to me. In any given day now, it’s actually impossible for me to give you a sense … [of what my] day looks like, because truly … every day is different.”
According to Morse, the slow shift from TV to online has helped CNN stay true to its focus on news coverage.
“CNN in it’s DNA is about the news,” Morse said. “It’s why when something happens in the world people come to us on air or online. We don’t want to be in the political chat channel -— we want to be a news channel.”
No one knows the path journalism is taking online, according to Morse, but he said CNN is dedicated to combining digital and broadcast.
“Fundamentally one of the things we are doing … is, in a really meaningful way, trying to put all of our resources together so that we’re approaching every day and every story from a holistic view on every platform so that digital and television work hand in hand,” Morse said. “It’s hard. Anybody who tells you they have all the answers is lying, because they don’t, because we’re figuring it out as we go, but what we’re finding is we want the most reporting resources we can have.”
In response to a rise in citizen journalists, Morse said CNN uses social media to see criticism and get a sense of their audiences’ opinions and voices.
“It’s a great early warning listening device,” Morse said. “It’s still our responsibility journalistically to sift through what we’re seeing.”
To better use resources, Brundige said CNN’s website is being used to tap into homes and provide a new one-on-one experience for the audience by changing their reporting style.
“I think [news is] much more personal than it’s ever been,” Brundige said. “Anyone who tries to come though my group to try to do an original video that I’m going to put online [should not be] coming across like a TV reporter doing a traditional stand-up telling me what’s happening. That’s not what I want at all. If you think about the experience … you may be watching [news] on a desktop, but you are also probably watching it on a tablet or phone. If you’re watching it on your iPhone, you’re holding your phone. It’s a one-on-one experience. So people telling you what’s happening needs to be sharing it like they’re your friends and that’s a hard thing to do.”
CNN’s primary goal is to inform even when attempting a new broadcast style online, according to Brundige.
“Think about what people want,” Brundige said. “Think about what you can give them that’s different from what they can read or see on TV. Think about how to make it personal and connect, and use all of the journalism.”
James Ortiz, a junior majoring in communication, agreed that online platforms will aid the future of journalism.
“All of [the speakers], even some students, brought up the point of how there’s a huge trend moving towards more online digital platforms and how that’s probably the next big step towards evolution in the news industry,” Ortiz said. “It’s not so much typical broadcast. Now, it’s how can we use different platforms and leverage them for different audiences and age groups.”

I don’t know about everyone else, but I’m still in shock over what I witnessed during last weekend’s NFC Championship Game.
In my opinion, the Seattle Seahawks don’t deserve to head to Super Bowl XLIX in Glendale, Arizona less than a couple weeks from now. Based on what I read in the box score and watched with my own eyes on Sunday, Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers should be the ones preparing to play the New England Patriots.
Though “Deflate-gate” also questions the integrity of whether Bill Belichick’s team should be playing in the big game, it’s these conspiracy theories that actually need to be deflated. I’m not a football equipment expert or anything, but are you really going to try and tell me that a couple of psi are going make a difference in a game that running back LeGarrette Blount scored three touchdowns on the ground en route to a 45-7 win?  Thought so.
However, what I continue to have trouble resonating with is how the Seahawks remarkably scored 15 points in 44 seconds to force a game in which they turned the ball over five times into overtime.
It still feels like a magician was playing a trick on me when Seattle receiver Jermaine Kearse caught a 35-yard strike from Russell Wilson to win the game, causing Wilson to cry his eyes out.
One could say it was a product of the continuous support and cheers by the dignified “12th man,” but even some of the record-breaking crowd didn’t believe in their team anymore and pulled their best Miami Heat fans by heading for the exits early.
I believe that there is really only one person that could have possibly made what seemed to be impossible into a reality.
And that man is none other than Seahawks’ field general and former USC head coach Pete Carroll.
Yes, Carroll does also have to give a lot of credit to his special teams coordinator and former assistant at USC, Brian Schneider, who managed to pull off a couple of special teams miracles by executing a fake field goal for a touchdown and an onside kick all in the same game.
But the decision making and instilled belief that the team is never out of the game, regardless of the score, all starts at the top with a guy like “Big Balls Pete” and his “Win Forever” philosophy.
I still get goose bumps from the day Carroll came to discuss his philosophy with the student body here at USC, and he said that “Win Forever” originated back during his 1994 season opener when his New York Jets took on the Buffalo Bills.
In his first game as head coach, the Jets won 23-3, but Carroll’s post-game discovery of the Bills’ consistent success, a display that showcased the team’s division five division championships over six years, gave him the nerve to coach teams to win forever.
This must be where the term “Big Balls Pete” originated, as it’s one of those ideas that sounds so crazy that you just have to believe it.
Nonetheless, it’s this foundation that paved the way for Seattle’s Super Bowl XLVIII victory and their miraculous comeback last Sunday.
I know its a cliche and all, but the best team on the field doesn’t always win the game. And flat out, the best team on the field that day didn’t win the NFC conference championship.
However, one can argue that special teams on the field is not what won the game for the Seahawks on Sunday. It was the “special teams” on the sidelines, rather, that really sealed the deal.
I don’t think anything can outweigh the mentality of knowing you’re going to win the game, despite all of the adversity. This all starts with Carroll applying that “Win Forever” mindset and continuing it in perpetuity.
USC fans all remember the golden era that he produced in his nine years at USC, where he went 83-19 (97-19 but 14 wins were vacated) en route to producing two national championships and 60 players who were selected in the NFL Draft.
I truly believe that if there’s one thing that current USC head coach Steve Sarkisian can learn from his predecessor and former colleague, it’s to try and figure out how he can instill a similar type of “Win Forever” belief in his program because “overall foundation” is one of the areas in which I think he is currently lacking.
I can’t really think of a game during the 2014 season in which USC exhibited a sense of resiliency or persistence when they faced adversity or trailed an opponent by more than a touchdown. Rather, we just witnessed some utterly atrocious collapses, cough cough Arizona State, that are just unacceptable for such a high-caliber program.
Games and, as a result, wins, were indeed, thrown away by the Trojans last year, but none were taken away from the opponent by the means of making a valiant come back.
Just take into account the UCLA game where the Bruins got up 28-14 on USC after one half and it seemed like all hope was lost.
If the Trojans really do want to make a run for the College Football Playoff and a national title, I believe that a foundation like “Win Forever” or a similar mantra to build on is absolutely necessary, especially for the younger guys like sophomores Adoree’ Jackson and Juju Smith.
Before you know it, spring practice will be in session, and then fall camp will quickly follow, so Sarkisian beter take a page out of Carroll’s book sooner rather than later.

As National Signing Day quickly approaches, USC’s football program continues to experience offseason changes.
Freshman wide receiver Rahshead Johnson has elected to transfer from USC, a school official confirmed to the Orange County Register on Wednesday. USCFootball.com Senior Analyst and Recruiting Editor Gerard Martinez reported that Johnson will likely enroll at Santa Monica Community College.
Johnson was a class of 2014 four-star recruit, recognized for his ability to play both cornerback and wide receiver. In his one season with USC, Johnson was a redshirt and, therefore, never played in a game.
Though the Trojans have lost wide receivers Nelson Agholor and George Farmer to the NFL Draft, it is likely that Johnson would rarely see playing time in the upcoming seasons.  JuJu Smith, who had an impressive freshman season even as the No. 2 receiver behind Agholor, will take over Agholor’s role as the go-to receiver. Smith will be accompanied by sophomore Darreus Rogers, redshirt freshman Steven Mitchell and freshman Ajene Harris.
Coach Steve Sarkisian has added additional weapons to his arsenal of receivers. He currently has commitments from two four-star receivers in Tristan Payton and De’Quan Hampton.
Speculation surrounding Johnson’s departure from USC highlights the University of Nevada, Las Vegas as a potential home for Johnson. USC has not released an official statement regarding the transfer.
Though the Trojans will be without Johnson, former USC All-American defensive lineman Kenechi Udeze has rejoined the team as an assistant strength and conditioning coach.
Udeze was a 2003 All-American for the Trojans after recording 26 tackles for losses, including 16.5 sacks.
Udeze was selected 20th overall in the 2004 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings, but had to retire from the NFL in 2009 after being diagnosed with leukemia. Udeze worked at the University of Washington for three seasons as an assistant strength coach and interned with the Seattle Seahawks.
Udeze will not be the only  new addition to the team next season, as Sarkisian has verbal commitments from 16 players in the class of 2015. USC can sign 19 players in total and is still in the running to sign top-ranked prospects cornerback Iman Marshall, defensive lineman Rasheem Green and linebackers Porter Gustin, Osa Masina and John Houston.
Players are allowed to sign their letters of intent on Feb. 4.

USC men’s volleyball (3-0, 2-0 MPSF) kicked off its season with two dominant wins at home against Stanford and Pepperdine, and now they look to take their dominance on the road to face UC San Diego (1-3, 0-2 MPSF).
After upsetting then-No. 2 Pepperdine and sweeping No. 12 Stanford, the undefeated Trojans have jumped three spots from  No. 8 to No. 5.
The Trojans are led by senior setter and team captain Micah Christenson. His ability to keep the Trojans focused throughout each set has become vital for their success. “These are some of the tightest teammates that we’ve had in a long time,” Christenson said. “We’re ready to take on the challenges of this season together.”
In addition to Christenson, redshirt sophomore outside hitter Christopher Orenic, senior middle blocker Robert Feathers, junior opposite hitter Josh Kirchner and freshman outside hitter Larry Tuileta all fuel USC’s offense. Against Stanford, they each produced a team-high of nine kills. The attacking strength and versatility of the offense proved too difficult for the Cardinal to contain, leading to their defeat in three straight sets. If the Trojans can continue their offensive flexibility and dominance at the net, their opponents will have a difficult time defending their attack.
Freshman standout Tuileta had his first start against Stanford and tied the team-high of nine kills and produced one solo block. Tuileta, also a quarterback for the football team, added to the Trojans offensive variability.
USC has also dominated  in serving. Against Pepperdine, USC had 11 service aces, five coming from Christenson. During the offseason, Christenson developed a new serve. He now uses a jump and float serve out of the same toss and debuted his new serve against Pepperdine.
“I’m happy with it so far,” Christenson said. “I’m only going to get better at it.”
Head coach Bill Ferguson recognized his team’s serving dominance against Pepperdine and modified the rotation to maximize his team’s scoring.
“We put our rotation to get three of our best servers [Christenson, Orenic and Feathers] on the line,” Ferguson said. “We look at that like a batting order.”
On the defensive side of the game, junior libero and team captain Brooks Varni is leading the team in digs with 28 on the season. Christenson is second with 23 digs. Varni works to keep the team focused and ready in the back to receive the opponent’s serves and spikes. The Trojans have averaged 9.6 digs per set and a .948 serve reception percentage.
“We worked hard in the offseason,” Varni said. “It showed in our play.”
Christenson and Varni run the team like a well-oiled machine on the court. Their leadership skills are evident when watching from the stands. After every point, the two captains huddle the team up and keep their teammates motivated and focused on one point at a time.
UCSD has struggled in the opening matches of its season. In conference play, UCSD suffered losses to Long Beach State and CSUN, both in three straight sets.
UCSD only averages 10.1 kills and .6 aces per set and a .143 attacking percentage, while USC averages 13.6 kills and 1.7 aces per set and a .274 attacking percentage. If the numbers hold up, USC should remain undefeated and emerge victorious in La Jolla this evening to focus on No. 3 UC Irvine the following night.

After a three-game home stand, the USC men’s basketball team will head up to the Pacific Northwest to take on Oregon and Oregon State.
The Trojans (9-8, 1-4) are coming off three straight home games that saw them go 1-2. After winning the first against the California Bears, the Trojans have lost two straight  games to Stanford and crosstown rival UCLA.
USC will come into the game relatively fresh, as the Trojans have had the past week off, and they hope the extra practice time will pay off following a disappointing loss the UCLA Bruins last Wednesday. Despite keeping the game close in the first half, the Trojans were blown out in the second half and ultimately fell 83-66.
Second-year big man Nikola Jovanovic had a strong game, scoring 20 points and grabbing five rebounds. However, the rest of the team struggled and couldn’t get the offense going. As a team, the Trojans shot just 41 percent from the field and were out rebounded 41-20 by the Bruins.
“We just got to be tougher. Simple as that,” Clark said. “They outplayed us. They out-toughed us on the boards. We got punked.”
The Bruins were led by backcourt duo Bryce Alford and Norman Powell who combined for 43 points. The Bruins had their way in the paint and had a drastic advantage on the boards due to their size advantage.
The Trojans will look to turn things around when they take on the Oregon Ducks (12-6, 2-3). The Ducks are coming off two straight losses of their own and will look to turn their fortune around against the struggling Trojans.
Senior guard Joseph Young, the second-highest scorer in the   Pac-12, highlights an experienced Oregon squad. The Ducks will also cause problems for the Trojans in the front-court. Led by forwards Elgin Cook and Dwayne Benjamin, the Ducks average roughly 40 rebounds per game. Freshman Jordan Bell also averages the second-most blocks per game in the Pac-12 with 3.5 and rounds out a solid front court rotation for the Ducks.
After being killed on the glass against the Bruins, USC will need to put extra emphasis on boxing out and rebounding as a team. USC has struggled mightily this season with rebounding as highlighted by Jovanovic after the UCLA loss.
“As a team we didn’t do a good job boxing-out or squeezing the ball with our hands,” Jovanovic said. “I tried to do my best but everyone needs to contribute. That’s why we lost. We need to put our things together.”
Jovanovic, who started out the season slowly after being hyped up for his offseason play with the Pac-12 All Stars, has started to find his groove. The Serbian has scored in double digits in 12 straight games while shooting well above 50 percent during that stretch.
The Trojans know what they have from their second-year big man, but will need their young core of freshmen to step up if they hope to compete on the road. Freshman guard Jordan McLaughlin has struggled since returning from an elbow injury.
Fellow freshman Malik Martin has failed to contribute in the past few games, with bench player Darion Clark steadily outplaying him. With Oregon having such a strong front court and Clark averaging almost double the amount of rebounds as Martin per game, don’t be surprised if head coach Andy Enfield opts to give the second-year player a couple of extra minutes.
Oregon has been extremely susceptible to the 3-point shot this season and with Ducks having one of the best shot blockers manning the paint, the Trojans should take full advantage of the outside shot.
The Trojans have struggled mightily against Oregon in years past, their last win coming in 2009. If the Trojans can continue to grow and play as a team- they have shown flashes this season, they can give the Ducks a run for their money.
USC will face Oregon on Thursday, Jan. 22 in Eugene, Oregon. Tipoff is set for 8 p.m. PST and will be aired on the    Pac-12 Network.
