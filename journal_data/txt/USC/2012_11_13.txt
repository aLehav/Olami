One of the most memorable wins for USC in 2011 was the 50-0 demolishing of crosstown rival UCLA in its season finale. With No. 17 UCLA currently ranked higher than No. 18 USC, however, the Trojans can’t afford to take them lightly this weekend.

“The record speaks for itself,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “As you watch them, they’re just doing a really good job managing situations … They haven’t had a lot of ups and downs, so you’ve got to give their staff a lot of credit. And they’re playing a lot of freshmen too.”
UCLA has rebounded from a 6-8 record last season to an 8-2 record this season. The Trojans are looking forward to playing the newly revitalized UCLA team at the Rose Bowl.
“Hopefully this isn’t my last time playing in the Rose Bowl,” senior quarterback Matt Barkley said. “This week is always big for this program, and it goes back a long way. … This game has a lot of meaning for both of these teams this year.”
It will be the first time visiting the Rose Bowl for junior running back Silas Redd, who was a noticeable scratch in USC’s game against Arizona State. The Penn State transfer is excited about the chance to play on the legendary field.
“This will be a great opportunity to play there at such a prestigious stadium,” Redd said. Redd did not practice today, but he expects to practice later this week and play against UCLA.

Coming off a sloppy win against Arizona State, the Trojans are determined to cut down their turnovers against UCLA. USC is tied for seventh worst in the country with an astounding 26 turnovers. This could be a huge disadvantage in Saturday’s game, as UCLA is tied for ninth in the nation with 25 takeaways.
“The emphasis of the entire practice was taking care of the football,” Kiffin said. “We were [protecting the ball] well for a while, and then we’ve kind of fallen back the past couple of weeks.”

Sophomore wide receiver and Heisman Trophy candidate Marqise Lee has to be eager to play against UCLA’s 103rd ranked pass defense.
“UCLA is way better than they were,” Lee said. “Coaches are great and players are great. I think it’s going to be a shootout; both teams will be going at it.”
Lee said that he feels a lot better after suffering an allergic reaction last weekend.
Additionally, Lee said that there’s “no way” that he will get to play defense against UCLA.
The team better be very concerned with the ‘ruins. Last season is light years past with game on the road this time.
A mediocre away from the Coliseum performances so far leaves doubts in my mind to the outcome this Saturday.
One last omen hopefully that will not take place is the comparison of Mora to Carroll in their first year at the helm. USC shutting out ucla 27 – 0 at home while being a slight underdog which is the exact circumstance in this season’s game for the other side.

It’s safe to say that, at this point in the season No. 18 USC was expected to be a major player in the Bowl Championship Series national championship race.
And guess what? They are, still.
Rematch · USC lost its regular season matchup with Oregon on Nov. 3, 62-51. The Trojans would likely play the Ducks again if USC defeats UCLA on Saturday, earning a berth in the Pac-12 championship game. – Sean Roth | Daily Trojan
Not in the way people expected the Trojans to be, though. Not an undefeated team on a collision course with Alabama. Though they might not be playing for the national title game anymore, they could still leave a profound effect on it.
It is presumptuous, to say the least, seeing as it is entirely possible that USC loses to a quality No. 17 UCLA team on Saturday. But if the Trojans win, their remaining games are against No. 3 Notre Dame on Thanksgiving weekend at the Coliseum and (probably) against No. 2 Oregon in the Pac-12 championship game the following Friday.
With the Fighting Irish, Ducks and No. 1 Kansas State all undefeated, it will presumably take a perfect season for a chance to play for the BCS crystal ball. If USC knocks off Oregon or Notre Dame, both of their chances are shot. In the 14-year history of the BCS, only two undefeated teams from one of the six major conferences have ever been denied the right to play for the national championship, and that was because they were ranked behind two other undefeated BCS teams. So it is safe to say that there is no chance any one-loss team gets in this year.
Right now, Notre Dame is on the outside looking in at two undefeated teams ahead of them. The Irish seemingly need Oregon or Kansas State to stumble in one of their final games. That would diminish USC’s matchup with the Irish since, even if USC wins, Notre Dame wouldn’t have made the title game anyways, right?
Wrong. There is no conceivable that the University of Notre Dame — of Rudy, Touchdown Jesus, “Play Like a Champion Today” and Knute Rockne fame — could win every single football game they play and not get the chance to play for a national championship. I know they are ranked No. 3. I know their wins have been unimpressive to say the least, and borderline unwatchable at times to say a little more. I know they have won quite a few games they probably shouldn’t have. But if the Fighting Irish go undefeated, it will play for the national title and this is an inevitable fact.
Oregon, of course, has been nothing short of the most impressive team in the country this year, and anyone who was at the Coliseum on Nov. 3 knows exactly what its offense can do. It would be an impressive win for USC to knock off either of these teams, and it would sort out an awful lot of questions assuming Kansas State runs the table.
But if the Trojans beat UCLA on Saturday, then beat Notre Dame in their regular season finale and beat Oregon in the Pac-12 title game, things would really get interesting. First and foremost, there would be only one undefeated team remaining: in Kansas State. That would mean voters would be faced with the unfortunate task of choosing among several one-loss teams such as the Irish or the Ducks, as well as the potential SEC champion in Alabama or Georgia, for the other spot in the title game, leaving a lot of unhappy teams and fans across the country who would feel their team deserved that spot.
If USC should knock off two of the nation’s remaining undefeated teams, they would open a door for the SEC champion to move into the national championship game.
This is a much bigger deal then it may initially seem. See, the winner of the SEC championship game has made the BCS championship game every year for the last six seasons, and five of those teams have won. The one loss was LSU last year, who fell to fellow SEC foe Alabama.
An SEC team has won the national championship for six straight years. Now, it appears the conference’s only chance to make it seven is with a little — or a lot — of help from USC. This is especially ironic because of the SEC’s general hatred of the Trojans’ third-year coach Lane Kiffin, a hate stemming from his one-year stint at Tennessee where he made quite a few waves, to say the least.
For USC, which felt so wronged by the Reggie Bush sanctions, to be almost singlehandedly responsible for total college football mayhem would be a sort of poetic justice. One thing Trojan fans wanted at the start of the year was to stick it to the NCAA by winning the national championship in their first year of bowl eligibility. That chance is long gone, but the Trojans still have a lot of say left in how this season winds down.
Just, this time, as the spoiler.

Senior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee were named among the 15-member watch list for the 2012 Walter Camp Player of the Year Award on Tuesday.

Barkley, who was also a semifinalist for the 2011 Walter Camp Award, has thrown for 2,972 yards, 33 touchdowns and 13 interceptions with a completion rate of 64.8 percent through 10 games.
Lee, who had a Pac-12 record of 345 yards receiving against Arizona on Oct. 27, has 98 receptions for 1,447 yards and 13 touchdowns to go with 110 yards rushing and is the only receiver and one of three sophomores on the list.
Barkley and Lee are two of four Pac-12 representatives, the others being Oregon running back Kenjon Barner and UCLA running back Johnathan Franklin.
The list includes players from each of the top five teams in the most recent BCS standings, including Barner, Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein, Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o, Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron and Georgia linebacker Jarvis Jones.
“It’s been another exciting college football season with many teams and players still in the hunt for national recognition,” Walter Camp Football Foundation President John Marks said in a statement. “We’ve identified some outstanding players and we know the final weeks of the regular season should be even more thrilling.”
USC currently has the most Walter Camp Award recipients of all-time with six award winners.
USC running back O.J. Simpson was the first-ever Walter Camp Award recipient, winning twice in 1967 and 1968.
Running backs Charles White and Marcus Allen also won as Trojans in 1979 and 1981, respectively. The most recent Trojan winners were quarterback Matt Leinart in 2004 and running back Reggie Bush in 2005.
The Walter Camp Award, the fourth-oldest college football award in the nation, is named after Walter Camp, an American football player, coach and sportswriter known as the “Father of Football.”
Five finalists for the award will be announced on Nov. 28.
The winner will be voted on by the Football Bowl Subdivision head coaches and sports information directors and presented during the 6 p.m. edition of ESPN SportsCenter on Dec. 6.

Coming off an 87 point offensive onslaught in a season-opening victory against Coppin State, the USC men’s basketball team turned to its defense in a matchup against the Long Beach State 49ers on Tuesday, winning by a final score of 62-44.
Midseason form · Senior point guard Jio Fontan missed all of the 2011-12 season with a knee injury. He has started both games this season and scored five points in Tuesday’s game against Long Beach State. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (2-0) were without sophomore Byron Wesley for the majority of the first half after the guard was charged with two fouls within the first two minutes of the game. They quickly went to redshirt junior forward Ari Stewart to pick up the scoring load, and Stewart obliged with eight first half points. He was aided by junior guard J.T. Terrell, who also put up eight first half points.
“We had a lot of good performances from a lot of guys,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “That’s what we hope this team ends up being about. We played hard.”
The 49ers tied things up at 35 apiece with a little more than 15 minutes remaining in the game following a 10-4 run. But USC never relinquished the lead, instead going on a 7-0 run of its own.
“We made our run in the second half with five bench guys in there,” O’Neill said. “… We’re hoping to develop some depth as this thing moves forward.”
Freshman guard Chass Bryan gave USC some quality minutes in the second half after senior guard Jio Fontan picked up his third foul. Bryan scored two baskets in the span of 24 seconds to help put the Trojans up by double-digits for the first time all night.
“That was exciting for me,” Bryan said. “Byron Wesley told me to just keep pushing it, and look to make plays, not be hesitant … the clock was coming down, and I just saw I had to put it up. I came right back down and did the same thing, it felt good.”
From there, USC was able to keep Long Beach State at bay, holding the 49ers to just 21.7 percent shooting in the second half. For the game, Long Beach State shot just 12-42 (28 percent) and seven of those makes were three pointers. They were held scoreless for over five minutes after knocking down a pair of free throws with 9:33 remaining.
“We just put more pressure on the ball, [made] them take tougher shots than in the first half,” senior forward Eric Wise said.
Junior center Dewayne Dedmon helped to seal things for good after USC went up by double-digits, converting on a tip dunk and taking a charge on the next possession. He finished the game with eight points and 10 rebounds in 18 minutes.
“I’m especially impressed with Dewayne Dedmon’s minutes,” O’Neill said. “He’s doing a fantastic job, our inside guys are doing a great job.”
USC’s depth was on full display for the second straight game, as 12 players made appearances at some point during the night. Nine of those players logged at least 10 minutes of action.
“[Coach O’Neill] talks about it every day — about who he’s going to sub in. I think he’s just going to go with who is doing well that night,” Wise said. “We’re so deep we have two players at every position.”
Three Trojans scored double-figures — Wise put up 10 points and 12 rebounds, Terrell added 10 points and Stewart finished with 10 points of his own. But O’Neill was especially impressed with his team’s composure against a squad that puts the pressure on defensively.
“Only 11 turnovers against a team that’s really an up-tempo defensive team … a very good team,” O’Neill said. “We feel fortunate to have won like we did.”
The Trojans will get a week off before traveling to Hawaii as part of the 2012 Maui Invitational. Their first opponent in the tournament will be the Illinois Fighting Illini, who are also off to a 2-0 start. Other participants include the No. 11 North Carolina Tar Heels, the Butler Bulldogs and the Texas Longhorns.
“I’m used to watching it, so I’m happy to be there and playing in it,” Wise said of the Maui Invitational. “I never thought I would.”

When two Chinese graduate students, Ming Qu and Ying Wu, were fatally shot off campus in April, members of the USC community were affected in many different ways. Feeling personal connections to the victims, three students, Yuxi He, Jiazheng Chen and Tien-Huei Grace Yeh, set out to create a film about Wu and Qu’s story.
The final product, titled City of Dreams, premiered Tuesday night at AMC Atlantic Times Square 14 in Monterey Park.
“When the accident happened, I followed the news tirelessly,” He, a graduate student studying communications management, wrote in an email. “There were crazy, sensationalist comments among every major media platform in China. I was very personally struck by what I felt was [the] misrepresentation [of] two human beings and I felt the need to act.”
Many of the headlines in China portrayed Wu and Qu as rich students, since they were sitting in a 2003 BMW when the shooting occurred. He and other Chinese students have sought to defend Wu and Qu’s images and portray the victims as hardworking international students.
“We work very hard to study well and further our careers, just like every other university student, regardless of where they’re from or how much money is in their family,” He said. “We have our own struggles, hopes and dreams.”
Though neither He nor her co-producers had any cinematic arts experience, they felt film would be the most powerful medium to tell their story. She said because of the strength of their message and the media attention the shooting received, the filmmakers were able to enlist the help of professionals and other volunteers to produce the film.
“I was so surprised and moved by all the kind support from every part of the community, our friends and sponsors funded this project,” she said. “My professors provided suggestions and Wu’s landlord provided her house to us for filming. Qu’s sister served as both story advisor and production assistant.”
The biggest obstacle the crew faced in producing the movie was funding. He said the team received support from alumni and friends after He and her associates created a trailer for the project. The large number of filming locations in the script also proved to be a challenge for the producers, but whenever they asked for assistance, people were willing to help.
“The fear, the confusion and the heartbreak we went through when tragedy struck still lives vividly in my heart,” He said. “We lost two beautiful souls that had incredible love for this city, but we didn’t lose hope. Los Angeles is still the City of Dreams in our hearts.”
The victims’ parents filed a lawsuit against USC in the Los Angeles Superior Court in May. On Monday, a judge said he would allow the plaintiffs to amend their arguments rather than dismissing the case, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Two suspects, Bryan Barnes and Javier Bolden, are charged with murdering Qu and Wu during the commission of a robbery. Both are currently awaiting trial.
We do not think that the Universities in California should be educating all of these foreign students.  There are too many of them going to college in California.  We think that the Universities should be only for the students born in California.  Too many people in California would like to attend graduate school but we cannot afford the tuition.  Unlike the foreign students the California born students pay every penny of our tution out of our own pocket!  We think that it is now time to deport all of the foreign born students!
Dear Diana,
Shut. the hell. up.
Thanks,
USC

Though religious observers often follow traditions in their faith with the same seriousness as the law, a Tuesday lecture revealed that these traditions sometimes stem from unusual places.
Reformation science · Brad Bouley, postdoctoral fellow of USC’s department of history, discusses the combination of religion and science. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
On Tuesday, USC postdoctoral fellow Brad Bouley presented a lecture titled “The Holy Body: Between Science and the Supernatural” as part of the Haunted Religion seminar, sponsored by USC’s Center for Religion and Civic Culture Interdisciplinary Research Group. The lecture focused on Bradley’s soon-to-be-published essay, which shares the same name.
Bouley delved into changes in the Roman Catholic Church’s canonization process after the Reformation, and highlighted the increasingly scientific approach of looking for physical evidence of supernatural works.
“One of the things the church had been doing since the high Middle Ages is officially canonizing people, and there is a very legalistic process by which people are canonized,” Bradley said. “After the fracture between the Protestant Church and the Catholic Church, they halt that for 65 years. There’s a lot of indication that it’s because people were concerned because they see a lot of abuses.”
Bouley also discussed the nature of the medical canonization process in relation to doctors. In the Middle Ages the church often commissioned doctors to perform autopsies on the bodies of people who were candidates for sainthood to find physical signs of holiness.
Bouley said doctors would look for anomalies in different organs or marks on the bodies as signs of sainthood.
“A saintly body should have an ongoing connection with God,” he said. “Therefore anatomical irregularities of the heart can count for canonization.”
Though the process was pseudo-scientific, doctors still faced social pressures to confirm certain people as saints. Bradley noted doctors very rarely argued against an individual being a saint.
“A lot of the time, the doctors they are bringing in are huge figures. They are famous doctors [the Catholics] are trying to bring in to buoy up the candidates,” he said. “So if you are bringing them in for a case like this, that immediately gives credence to the person, unless the doctor says no, but it’s very hard to say no. We have cases where people in the area say, ‘Look, if you say no to this body, we are going to stone you.’”
Bouley discussed how doctors came to assume the role of providing medical proof as an extension of the forensic role they already occupied in the legal system. At the time, doctors were called to provide forensic evidence for murder trials.
“There was a long back story of giving forensic evidence, and in many ways, the evidence you are looking at for deciding canonization in many ways is forensic evidence,” Bouley said, “so it is not that big of a leap to go to that [canonization].”
Fascinating and revealing. The more things change…

Undergraduate Student Government approved four new associate justices to the organization’s judicial council at its Tuesday meeting. USG President Mikey Geragos selected the justices based on their wide range of diversity and interests on campus.

The bylaws of USG’s constitution require there be six associate justices and one chief justice sitting on USG’s judicial board at a given time. A justice can serve a maximum term of 48 months, so once appointed, most justices serve until they graduate.
Though a permanent branch of the organization, the judicial board is activated mostly during the election cycle to serve as an outlet for students to express any grievances with student government.
The judicial branch has historically served a more silent role. Chief Justice Jaime Castrellon, a junior majoring in political science and neuroscience, said he believes the judicial branch is supposed to have a subtle role.
“It’s a way for the students to directly challenge an issue that they may take issue with or they find unfair for whatever reason,” Castrellon said. “[Students] always have that option to come to us and file a complaint. We’re an open space for students to just come to us.”
Compared to student government’s legislative and executive branches, Castrellon said he does not believe the judicial branch and its members are as publicized on the USG website. Castrellon also believes another reason why the judicial branch is less identifiable is because its deliberations are private and it plays a more passive role in campus life.
“You hear more about the senate and executive branch during the election cycle,” Castrellon said. “Justices must remain completely impartial and cannot support any candidate in general.”
To file a complaint, students are required to go to USG’s office in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Castrellon hopes this system can be updated to give students the option of filling out online complaint forms, as it will also make the process more efficient.
“The judicial council’s duty is to respond in the most expedited manner,” Castrellon said.
Justices are required to respond to complaints within seven days, but during the election cycle they must have a quicker turnaround of 24 hours.
The legislative and executive board elections for USG will take place starting in February. Applications are available online and print applications will be available beginning Nov. 27.
As the new election cycle gets underway, Castrellon expects the justices to become more active. In the past, they have dealt with violations ranging from sign placement to illegal early campaigning.
“Our powers are limited to when we hear cases and to the issues that have been brought up to us,” he said. “But if we find that some action that was taken or legislation that was passed was in violation of the constitution then it is our duty to rectify the situation.”
Though Castrellon considers his job to be reactionary, the chief justice recognizes that the justices might not be addressing all the student body’s needs.
“It isn’t often that we hear complaints,” Castrellon said. “I don’t know if it’s because students aren’t having any problems or because there’s a disconnect.”
Despite the concerns, Geragos said the justices are an integral part of the organization and lead it in the right direction.
“They definitely strengthen USG by making us accountable to our rules and essentially just holding USG and its members accountable,” Geragos said.
According to Geragos, justices provide an additional check and balance to student government.
“They’re a great unbiased board and they’re not necessarily supposed to be the most outward body,” Geragos said. “But it does need to be available to students who have a problem or for student government members who need something to be brought to their attention.”
The newly appointed justices are Jared Ginsberg, Nerses Aposhian, Logan Lochman and Erick Nelson. The returning justices are Melinda Foletta and Anthony Wu.

You might call them The Dixie Chicks of Latin music.
Thornton popular music senior Suemy Gonzalez, along with her group Trio Ellas, has been nominated for a Latin Grammy in the Regional Mexican Field. Gonzalez’s group performs a modern interpretation of traditional mariachi music.

With a strong Los Angeles following and online presence, the group has had some mild success since its formation in 2006. Still, the Latin Grammy nomination came as a surprise.
“When I was watching the press conference where they announced the nominees, they started listing the names of all these well-known people and then they announced us at the end, Trio Ellas, and I started shaking when I heard our name,” Gonzalez said. “I couldn’t believe it.”
This is the first Latin Grammy nomination for the Thornton student, who began her career at age five.
“I started out playing classical music, and I did [it] pretty much throughout high school,” Gonzalez said. “However, around the age of 11 or 12, my parents wanted me to get in touch with my Mexican culture, and so they started introducing me to mariachi music. I started playing with a local band in Sacramento, which is where I’m from, and ever since then I fell in love with the music itself.”
After high school, Gonzalez began touring with professional mariachi show groups all over the United States, which delayed the completion of her college degree but allowed her to develop her own musical interpretations.
“After many years of performing and playing and touring it came to my senses that I wanted to go back to school to study music the right way and learn how to put my ideas on paper,” said Gonzalez. “I knew that USC has an amazing music program and I thought the pop music program would be something very accommodating for me also, because at the time I was part of the band Trio Ellas.”
The group began when Gonzalez moved to Los Angeles after getting a job at Disneyland six years ago. The budding songstress already knew the other members of the group, Nelly Cortez and Stephanie Amaro, who were making their own advances in the music field. Still, the three musicians teamed up to form Trio Ellas, and the success of their first gig proved that the choice was a good one.
“We went out to a restaurant to play the typical mariachi music and the manager of that restaurant really liked our sound,” Gonzalez said. “It was the first time we got together and were creating music together.”
Trio Ellas started playing at the restaurant on a weekly basis and started getting clientele who would hire the group for private parties and weddings.
“At that point, we were still sticking to the traditional mariachi sound but people started asking us for different songs like ‘Hotel California’ especially because we’re in America,” Gonzalez said. “We were like, wait a minute, we can do that. We can totally step out of the box and do that kind of stuff. That’s where the group began.”
Con Ustedes…Trio Ellas — Trio Ellas’ current album — features songs that combine traditional Latin mariachi music with a contemporary style.
“We really like harmonies. We like Andrews Sisters type of harmonies,” said Gonzalez. “When people hear us for the first time they think that it’s a very fresh sound.”
This sound is what attracted Thornton professor Andy Abad, who produced the album. Since Trio Ellas didn’t have a large budget  to support its music, Abad created an arrangement for the group, which met with approval from the band’s members.
“My goal was just to have them do what they do and capture it in the best way possible,” Abad said. “[Gonzalez’s] talent, as well as the rest of the group’s talent, made producing the album a lot easier to do.”
Abad met Gonzalez before she enrolled at USC.
“I really know her musically and I know the band very well musically so I know what they can do and I know their strengths,” said Gonzalez. “They’re such a strong musical group.”
The strength that Trio Ellas possesses stems mainly from the fact that they do not have a record label. The freedom to find a style and voice has largely benefited the group.
“What we’ve done so far, we’ve done it on our own,” Gonzalez said. “We’re proud that we’re very independent. We do our own arrangements and we bring in our own ideas to the table.”
Matias Mora, a Thornton student majoring in popular music, also brought in his own ideas to the group: He created the art design for the album, which features the three lovely band members dolled up in traditional Hispanic garb as they stare unabashedly into the lens.
“Matias is also a student in my program and I had seen his work and he’s a super talented guy,” said Gonzalez. “I just approached him one day asking if he would be interested in doing artwork for our album.”
Matias said he was excited to work on the album art and had a great time working with the group.
“They definitely knew what they wanted and had a strong artistic vision, which is always a good thing” Matias said. “I tried to make it representative of the tradition that the music instills while still being feminine at the same time. I tried to pay homage to the tradition of older Hispanic music.”
Another shot of the group features Gonzalez, Cortez and Amaro resting on a fountain in the open sunlight, smiling at one another as play their instruments. When viewing the three women in this way, it’s easy to forget Trio Ellas is just an upcoming group that was started only six years ago. For the talented musicians, the Latin Grammy nomination was a pleasant surprise, but hopefully only the first of many to come.
“It’s definitely something very surreal that hasn’t really hit me yet. I wasn’t expecting for all this to happen so quickly,” Gonzalez said. “It’s an amazing feeling that we’re competing against a huge base in the Latino music industry. We’re totally the underdogs here. It’d be nice if we win but with these other names, it’s a close call.”
The Latin Grammys air Thursday Nov. 15.

Following on the heels of their September release, ¡Uno!, Green Day has released the second installment in its trilogy project, appropriately titled ¡Dos!. Whereas ¡Uno! saw the band return to  its traditional pop-punk sound after dabbling in the theatrical with two rock operas, ¡Dos! finds the trio pulling out all the stops for its right to party.
If there’s one thing Green Day has down pat, it’s alter egos. Between the three members, there are four main side projects that the band is part of. Pinhead Gunpowder is Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong’s successful side project, in which he plays alongside self-proclaimed “punk anthropologist” Aaron Cometbus, Bill Schneider and longtime Green Day backup guitarist Jason White. Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt also has his side project, playing in New England-based punk band The Frustrators.
Along with these side projects, Green Day is also known for its mysterious alter egos, The Network and Foxboro Hot Tubs. The Network can best be described as a New Wave/pop-punk band and has the trio penning and recording tracks under typically colorful pseudonyms — Fink (Armstrong), Van Gough (Dirnt) and The Snoo (Green Day drummer Tré Cool). While Green Day still denies being The Network, the trio has at least owned up to Foxboro Hot Tubs as being one of its secret identities. The band name was originally used by Green Day to book secret shows, but ultimately the band took on a life of its own. Before long, an acclaimed album was recorded and released, and the grimy Foxboro Hot Tubs established itself in its own right with its raw, prototypical garage rock sound.
The grungy ‘60s sound of Foxboro Hot Tubs is what Green Day was aiming to replicate in ¡Dos!. As Dirnt explained in an interview with Guitar Center Magazine, “¡Dos! is more garage rock — a little dirtier, like you’re in the middle of the party.” And what a party it is.
The album is definitely hedonistic in nature, with lush lyrics and riotous imagery, containing echoes of the Foxboro Hot Tubs. In a June interview with Rolling Stone, Armstrong even stated, “The more we played [the songs], we thought, ‘This is pretty good. Why should we give it to our alter-ego?’”
Though aspects of the grime rock Foxboro Hot Tubs are known for is apparent in some songs, somehow the band doesn’t quite manage to get the exact feel. At times, ¡Dos! ironically comes across as a band trying to knock off the sound of bands like the Foxboro Hot Tubs. Ultimately, this could be due in part to Green Day still wanting to keep the songs entrenched in its traditional pop-punk sound. Though garage rock elements are undoubtedly present, the production of the album is much poppier and sharper than a Foxboro Hot Tubs release, so the record is still conspicuously under the Green Day trademark.
The record starts off with “See You Tonight,” a simple tune clocking in at just over one minute with Armstrong and his acoustic guitar. Once the song ends, the record kicks into “F*ck Time,” a Green Day-ized cover of the Foxboro Hot Tubs song, “It’s F*ck Time.” If there’s one aspect in which the Foxboro Hot Tubs influence stands apparent, it’s Armstrong’s lyrics. “Baby Eyes” is an upbeat, happy ditty with an unexpected twist — hilariously dark and menacing lyrics. With lines like “They say my middle name is danger / The kind you keep away from strangers,” you can’t really lose.
“Stray Heart” begins with what seems like has become a staple in royalty-free music — a beat that sounds like a mix of Iggy Pop’s “Lust For Life,” The Jam’s “A Town Called Malice” and The Supremes’ “You Can’t Hurry Love.” The fact that the beat has been lifted from so many musical predecessors doesn’t detract from the song, mainly because it works — if there ever was a beat made that asks to be ripped off, it’s this one.
“Wow! That’s Loud” definitely lives up to its name, clocking in as the longest track on the album (4:27) with an epic instrumental buildup rounding out the song at the end. Overall, though, the song is one of the album’s plainer songs, along with “Ashley” and “Lazy Bones.”
Album standouts include the deliciously fun “Makeout Party,” a track that could have easily been performed by Foxboro Hot Tubs. “Makeout Party” is pure and proper raucous garage rock, with lines like “I’m just gonna kiss you till your lips are bleeding” begging to be sung along to. Other highlights include the boisterous “Lady Cobra” and album-closer “Amy,” a warm and touching ballad written by Armstrong for the late Amy Winehouse.
The most interesting song on the album is “Nightlife,” which features Lady Cobra from the band Mystic Knights of the Cobra. The song is notable because of Lady Cobra’s rapping, making for an interesting mix of pop-punk, New Wave and rap.
The album definitely doesn’t put on any fronts — ¡Dos! is unabashedly a party album that wants its listeners to forget everything and enter the hedonistic kingdom that Foxboro Hot Tubs is so great at conjuring. Green Day’s venture into various genres thankfully isn’t taken too seriously by the band, and ¡Dos! is ultimately an enjoyable ride down into the carefree land of lush punk.

With the rise of the digital age, it’s easy to say that traditional film criticism is dead. Blogs, Twitter, Facebook and myriad up-and-coming digital outlets have become the norm, pushing established film critics — many of whom started in print — out of the way.
But it’s too much of a generalization to say that Deadline Hollywood is in and the Los Angeles Times is out, or that bloggers have replaced established critics, such as Kenneth Turan, Leonard Maltin, Ella Taylor and Roger Ebert.
The issue is more complex than that, simply because film criticism will never go out of style. Moviegoers will always demand reviews; it’s not like they can trust million-dollar advertising campaigns to inform them as to whether they should see a film or not. Film lovers require unbiased critiques on new films.
What moviegoers need to address are the changes that online criticism has imposed on the craft: Film criticism is heading online, along with much of journalism in general, but it doesn’t mean film criticism is dead or dying.
Film lovers also need to look at the implications of these changes: Online outlets are creating a new platform for criticism to reach broader audiences and for emerging critics to find their own rhetorical space.
As a practice, film criticism hasn’t changed all that much over the years. For as long as film criticism has existed, the process has really just been see films, share thoughts with readers, repeat.
“I’ve read [critics] back from the ’30s, ’40s and ’50s,” said Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan. “It doesn’t seem like what they were doing is very different from what I’m doing.”
But what is changing are the ways in which readers consume film reviews, which in turn affects the ways readers perceive film criticism.
Just take a look back at famed film critics Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael. Their reviews were part of the public discourse of the mid-to-late 20th century, and their opinions really mattered.
“People really talked about those reviews; it was part of the cultural conversation of that era, to read what Pauline said about this, to read what Sarris said about that,” said film critic/author/TV personality Leonard Maltin (Indiewire, Leonard Maltin’s Movie Guide, Entertainment Tonight).
But now, as the digital age continues to grow, the value of a film critic’s opinion seems to go unappreciated.
“The Internet has empowered everyone to become his or her own critic,” Maltin said.
And then there’s the lack of patience among many moviegoers who want answers quickly. They simply want to know whether a movie is “good” or “bad,”creating the demand for aggregator sites such as Rotten Tomatoes, which creates a general score for a film based on the perceived positivity or negativity of a review. For some, this creates a problem where the content of the review — including thoughtful analysis — fall in favor for blunt, easily digestible notions of quality.
“It’s a handy shorthand, but the problem is that many people only want to use critics as a consumer report. Is it good, is it bad? Thumbs up, thumbs down? What’s the score on the Tomatometer?” Maltin said.
Maltin brings up a good point: Though Rotten Tomatoes is a useful tool, when readers take away a film critic’s review in its entirety, they lose the knowledge and experience that has gone into making a compelling argument for or against a film.  Not to mention, they lose often-fascinating pieces of writing.
Mind you, that doesn’t mean that well-written, informed and interesting criticism ceases to exist. Nor does it mean that a blogger’s opinion is invalid. In fact, many bloggers are big-time film critics in the making who are rejuvenating the craft.
“You hear an awful lot from disgruntled film critics about the fact that there’s no good film criticism anymore, and I don’t really agree with that,” said film critic Ella Taylor, who currently works for NPR. “I think that the Internet has in some ways done wonders in bringing up new, young film critics who otherwise probably wouldn’t have gotten the opportunity to be writing — but the vast majority of them are writing for free.”
The Internet is not the enemy. In fact, it has helped film criticism spread on all levels of media.
“Social media is mostly chatter among friends,” wrote Chicago Sun-Times film critic and TV personality Roger Ebert. “There is still enormous value in expert and experienced criticism. Because of the Internet (which offers much, much more than social media) I believe there is more good film criticism available than at any earlier time in history.”
And if the Internet is actually enabling criticism, then criticism isn’t a dying art — it’s merely going through a rough patch.
“I guess you’d have to say it’s suffering,” Turan said. “I mean, compared to the high point before they fired all the people it’s definitely worse. But is it on its deathbed? I don’t think so.”
Film criticism has survived transitioning into new mediums before (remember when it moved from print to television with Siskel & Ebert?) and it will surely change again, but it will always exist. As long as there are movies, there will always be a need for film criticism.
And once we figure out how to monetize criticism online, and put our faith and attention back in professional film critics, it will likely thrive again.

On Friday, USC Annenberg’s first annual Global Media Festival will celebrate the many media genres the world has to offer. The event, held from 12:30 to 5:30 p.m. in the Annenberg Amphitheater, Room 204, will feature four panels exploring media, its challenges and triumphs across cultures, genres, societies, languages, time and industries. From the dramatic flair of the telenovela to the art of Chinese film, the festival reflects the global vibrancy that lies at the heart of USC, raising awareness of all that can be shared using the power of media.
Cultural commentary · The Annenberg School will host its first annual Global Media Festival on Friday in the Annenberg Amphitheater, where students will have a chance to attend panels with media celebrities. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
The four 50-minute panels will feature accomplished media producers and academic experts as well as short screenings of their works. The Global USC panel will spotlight producers from USC student filmmakers — Manouchka Kelly Labouba of Gabon, Jean Paulo Lasmer of Brazil and Alberto Marenco Saenz of Colombia — all of whom will share their experiences of media production in countries around the world.
First-year graduate student Meng (Cassie) Wu, majoring in communication management, will lead the festival as the executive producer of the event.
“This festival is about producers of media from different parts of the world getting together and giving the audience, especially USC students, a chance to learn about the practices in producing media all over the world,” Wu said. “Currently, media is both global and highly segmented, so this is actually a chance to … [also] promote mutual understanding, tolerance and acceptance.”
But besides building bridges, media is all about sharing narrative.
“The one thing we want people to understand is that … there’s a lot we all share in common about the need to tell stories, though the way we tell them may be different. Fundamentally, our need to tell stories is human nature,” said Annenberg Professor David Craig. “The interesting thing for audiences to discover will be that the ways media is being produced have converged into almost the same format and medium, but the content itself still remains culturally, linguistically or regionally specific. The boundaries that divide us are opportunities for what can unite us.”
But as global as the event has turned out, the festival first took flight as a course project by students in this semester’s (CMGT 599) “Hollywood Production Culture” class taught by Craig. Students of (CMGT 559) “Global Hollywood,” another one of Craig’s courses, helped specifically coordinate the Chinese media panel.
Though planning for the event began as early as summer, the students stepped up to put together the entire event this fall. Split into planning, promotion, web and production committees, the class wasted no effort over the last few months to produce and launch an event of this magnitude.
In fact, Craig said he was “stunned” by the amount of talent in the classes that contributed to the event.
“I’ve been blown away. Students have been incredibly creative and have shown tremendous initiative. The website is one of the best that I’ve ever seen,” he said. “They’ve worked very hard to secure some terrific talent to be a part of the festival itself, and I’m convinced this will come out brilliantly.”
The Chinese media panel features UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor Yiman Wang; UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television scholar  and Assistant Professor Sean Metzger; and Beijing Normal University representatives Yiwen Wang, Yan Zhang and Xing Zhou. Jordan Kerner, producer of Smurfs, and Amazon Studios’ Kevin Bannerman, a former executive at Fox Animation Studios and Disney, will speak on the Global Animation panel, alongside Candace Reckinger and Michael Patterson, faculty at the USC school of Cinematic Arts who directed a string of MTV hits including Suzanne Vega’s “Luka,” Sting’s “Be Still My Beating Heart” and Paula Abdul’s Grammy award-winning “Opposites Attract” music video.
Last but not least, the Mexican media panel “Soaps and Sensibilities” will showcase Carla Estrada and other premier creators of telenovelas, one of the most prolific television genres in Mexico. At the end of the event, the first-ever Media Maker Award will be delivered to Estrada, a renowned producer of soap operas and telenovelas in her own right.
Alex Ago, the USC School of Cinematic Arts’ Director of Programming and Special Projects, will moderate the first three panels, while Laura Flores Ibinarriaga, a current graduate student at USC, will moderate “Soaps and Sensibilities.”
Elizabeth Price and Che Chester, both first-year graduate students studying communication management, acted as the heads of the promotion and planning committees, respectively.
The festival is, for Chester, an embodiment of media’s immense value.
“Media is a conveyance of ideas, understanding where people are coming from as they are conveying their ideas,” he said. “It’s huge. That’s why we’re here, to understand why things are being produced, whatever it is, even down to [tweets or social media].”
Price dreams big for this event.
“I hope that people’s horizons will be expanded,” she said. “I hope that their perspectives will be enlightened, their curiosity is increased and also that they feel a satisfaction from the panels offered. I hope that’s something that we continue, because I feel like it’ll be really successful and that it’s important, given that media is such an important thing in our lives today.”
Craig hopes to continue holding the festival for years to come.
“It will change every year with different panels, but the students will be producing this every year,” he said.
Wu shares the same vision, and is sure that “the meaning of the festival will expand, and be enriched … year after year.”
This first global festival seems perfect for USC, a school with one of the most diverse and cultural student bodies in the country.
As Chester said, “The panels are very global, but it’s still USC. It’s still about enriching our school, and I think it helps us all become more aware of the globalization going on outside of campus, and I think that should be the biggest takeaway.”
 
Admission to the Global Media Festival is free, but attendees must RSVP online.

There was an embarassing incident last Thursday when an administration employee instructed Dept. of Public Safety officers to throw three doctorate students out of an event celebrating the groundbreaking of Wallis Annenberg Hall on suspicion of being protestors.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
The three second-year Ph.D. communication students — Alex Leavitt, Emma Bloomfield and Marcus Shepard — were falsely identified by an employee of the administration as being members of the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, which for three semesters has been protesting the use of sweatshop labor to make USC apparel.
Aside from the public relations faux pas, however, the incident further illuminates a serious problem with the administration’s recent stance on free speech at USC, particularly where SCALE is concerned.
The standing legal interpretation of the U.S. Constitution is that it only restricts the power and actions of the government. Therefore, private institutions such as USC are not compelled constitutionally to uphold an individual’s First Amendment rights.
The state constitution of California, however, includes an affirmative right to free speech, one on which private institutions cannot infringe. USC is also subject to its own regulations governing the free speech of its students. The SCampus and Student Code of Conduct, for example, repeatedly state that USC supports free speech, provided it does not incite illicit activity, interfere with the day-to-day operations of the university or constitute hate speech.
The university administration, therefore, had little basis for denying these students admission to an event — one they were, in fact, specifically invited to — for fear they might choose to express their opinions while in attendance. Leavitt, while acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes, expressed his distaste with the policy he was falsely accused of violating.
“That our exclusion originated in an insinuation that particular students do not have the freedom or privilege to speak out on and about our campus … is outright disappointing,” Leavitt said.
Recently, USC has tightened up security at student events in response to escalation of SCALE’s activism, which has intensified since a September factory fire in Pakistan that killed 289 garment workers and represented one of the biggest industrial disasters in history.
According to Women’s Wear Daily, a factory monitoring agency certified the facility for fire safety in an audit less than a year before the tragedy occurred. This same monitor, UL Responsible Sourcing, is listed in USC’s License Social Responsibility Compliance Manual as one of the university’s approved third-party auditing firms for factories in which university-licensed products are manufactured.
When labor rights become a matter of life or death, it would seem prudent for the university’s administration to engage with students on this important local, national and global issue. It seems, however, that the university has ignored these students for so long that it is unable to correctly identify them.
Members of SCALE are exercising their First Amendment rights, which the university claims to wholeheartedly support, as well as their civic duty to speak out when an American institution is not respecting human dignity, health and, in the case of the factory fire, life.
But instead of recognizing them for the responsible community members they are, the administration has labeled this group a scourge on the campus, to the point that merely looking like members was enough to get Leavitt, Bloomfield and Shepard ejected from an event.
The university should encourage open dialogue between the administration and students who want to see their school enact positive change.
If USC were to embrace rather than suppress the message its students are trying to send, it could steer clear of restricting free speech on campus and provide the university with future opportunities to take a stand on important community and global issues.

Nice to post with people that hide with only first names. Keep being cowards.
I am all for CODOH. The Jews fear them because that would make the Jews accountable to FACTS about the holocaust. Wouldn’t want to do that would we? The only holocaust happened to Germans. Dresden, Hamburg and 30 + other cities. The six million is a fraud, a lie. Time for you people to do your homework. Out web site CCFIILE exposes all the lies.
CODOH is a joke. Flaunt your insignificance with your skinhead friends, not civilized society.
Look, I get it—promoting this stuff is your job. You’re incredibly unlikely to convince anyone here to side with you, though, and your unceasing posts that are irrelevant to the articles on this site do nothing to further your (flawed) cause. I know—you can’t resist an opportunity to scream “freedom of speech!” yet you never acknowledge (1) that the Daily Trojan’s advertisements are not a public space, (2) that USC is not a public space, and (3) that no one here takes you seriously. Go back to your silly little town and your silly little life and leave us people who have actual lives alone.
That said, if you’d like to start a crusade against illegals here, go for it. That is an actual problem (albeit one that would significantly damage the American economy if it were immediately “solved”).
I’ll note that my second paragraph was facetious and intended to highlight another area of “expertise” that our friend Joe takes an active interest in.
(1) The Trojan’s advertisements are NOT a public space. Granted.
(2) USC is not a public space. Granted.
(3) No one here takes us seriously. Well, one or two people MIGHT take us seriously (I certainly do), but granted, most people haven’t even heard of us. WHY IS THAT?
     Because the Daily Trojan, as IS THEIR RIGHT, declines our advertisements. Doing so is inimical to free speech. It DOES NOT violate any RIGHTS we have – it is mere censorship, of a type they have every right to conduct. They claim to advocate free speech, yet censor us. Not a public space – just a poseur of free speech.
      Maybe they’ll censor you someday. I wouldn’t like that, as I abhor censorship.
You (deliberately?) ignore the fact the Daily Trojan has, one could argue, an obligation to direct  the advertisements that it publishes to the interests and benefit of itself and its readers. If they had to choose between advertisements that are directly relevant to USC students and yours, which are not, I would argue that good editors would choose something that would apply to their readers.
By the way, DT, from a design perspective, I do think it would be advisable to either escape HTML sequences in usernames or remove them entirely, as you do inside postings, lest you invite spam links.
True that.
Also I’m pretty sure we wouldn’t be hearing the same complaints from you in the instance of an affirmative-action bake sale being closed down. Again, please leave to exercise your blatantly partisan protestorism at a university that cares.
I disagree. If you want to protest, and be disruptive to students actually seeking to educate themselves, go somewhere else. UC Berkeley has a very vibrant protest environment in which you can occupy buildings, march into classes, and act like idiots (also called protestors). Part of the reason I want to USC is because of its reputation for being an institution of higher education, and NOT a radical, crazy, disgustingly protestor environment like UC Berkeley. You have the right to act like an idiot elsewhere. Francesa, please exercise your right to move and go somewhere else.
Couldn’t have said it better myself. Well said, Joe!
Having the CODOH morons post on here is almost as annoying as the skinheads that showed up a few years ago, creating a ruckus and disturbing the day to day operations. Perhaps these groups are one and the same?
All true.
This is the second time in only a few weeks these crazy America haters in SCALE have caused a ruckus on campus in a attempt to garner favorable media coverage.  In between their self created media circuses, SCALE was apparently completely silent to the attempted murder on campus of some kids attending a Halloween party by a thug gang member but have all the time in the world to protest progress at USC.   For all the fools like this Ryan kid in SCALE, progress is building new buildings.  Tearing down old ones to build new ones is jobs, jobs here in America.   America comes first with me and my family and if some crazy fellow America haters in Pakistan get cooked in some factory, I say good riddance!  There a few less potential terrorist or supporters of terrorists that me and family need to worry about.      
Time for the leaders of SC to ban the SCALE group from meeting on campus.
There’s so much wrong with this post that all I can deign to say is “ok, John, time to take your medicine and have a nice nap.”
To quote John ’55 from a Saturday night: “get off my lawn!”
Kid, I live on a golf course and happen to love people walking on my grass…
You want a cookie?
It amazes me kids like you get into college.  Your parents must be so proud.
And it’s amazing to me that ignoramuses like you made it to college, let alone through it.
Brad,
Coming from a America and Jew hater like yourself just proves my point.  
I hope you grow up some day but I’m not holding my breath waiting…
Ah yes, Brad. How anti-semitic of you to stand up to the guy denying the Holocaust.
Half hearted at best.  Lest we forget your heritage Ryan.
Valid point, John. I can’t think of anything tremendously horrible that’s ever come from judging people by their heritage.
John, maybe you consider yourself an adult age-wise, but you haven’t grown up yet, or at least grown with the times. I’ve been around the world more times than you have – I guarantee it. And everywhere I’ve been, people have treated me with respect because I care to take a deep interest in their language, culture, and well-being. I don’t just think “America or bust” – I form my own opinions and critiques because I can think for myself (college helped with that, but you must have missed that part, since you claim to be a heavier drinker than anyone in the current college generation) and don’t give two cents about what you think I am. I am a global citizen and proud of it – people in other countries deserve just as much respect as any American. Watching you spit fire via worthless ad hominem (sorry, I forgot English is your only language: personal attacks and name-calling) on a college newspaper is rather amusing to me. If you are truly an alum of our great institution that is USC, well, this helps confirm that our admissions standards have risen over a span of 50 or so years.
I’m not part of scale or a current student, but the way you consistently bash a group like SCALE, a group that is looking out for the well-being of other human beings (are they really asking for that much?), no matter the difference, is mind-boggling. Calling them names is immature at best – it’s something one learns isn’t proper at, let’s see, around five years old. And attacking Ryan because of his German heritage, assuming he (and I) are “Jew haters” is pathetic. I could say something similar about you and a few historical hate groups in America or otherwise, but a) I don’t stoop to that level of ignorance, b) it doesn’t make any sense anyway, and c) you’d probably think it does and be proud of whatever association is made.
I’m guessing that your eyesight has probably worsened over the years, but I didn’t realize that myopia could spread from the eyes to the brain so easily.
Brad,
When you decide to make a valid point, let us all know.
John, have you been hitting out of the bunker a lot lately? Either way, you have a lot of sand in your ears.
anyone else hear a big “whoosh” sound? sounded like it came from above john’s head
Good to see you again, John.
Now to be fair, you can’t really call this incident SCALE’s “self-created media circus.” I would lay all the responsibilities for this unfortunate instance at the administration’s feet. They were ones who excluded three students from a campus event on the false assumption that they were SCALE members. In fact, as far as I know, there were no SCALE members present at the groundbreaking, and certainly none intent on protesting. As I’ve said below, I’m not quite sure how protesting the building of WAH would fit within SCALE’s purview. Nor does the unfortunate shooting on Halloween, which — while certainly a tragedy — doesn’t fall within the specific range of issues covered by our particular group. That being said, the media circus that would arise if USC tried to ban a student-run advocacy group would be a sight to behold I’m certain. Maybe you should lobby for them to do so. I can’t think of a better way you’d could help out the cause.
Ryan,
Though I respect your intent, it’s all balderdash in your response and you know it.
I’m afraid I don’t, John.
Care to disclose the reason behind your obsession with SCALE, Francesca? You’re quite the pseudo-journalist. And really—SCALE sucks, its ideas suck, its motivations suck, and its members lack a basic understanding of the economics underlying a globalized economy. Then again, what’s the point of learning useful things in school? It’s all about “expanding your mind,” right?
Anonymous, first off, your mostly-accusatory comment not only lives up to ad nauseum, but when you bring in the “you suck” rant, I think I speak for most people when I say I’ve heard pubescent teens on Call of Duty throw more articulate fits. 
Secondly, economics is only one thing underlying a globalized economy. These sweatshops often abuse their workers (which tend to be women and children) physically and sexually and often overlook basic safety regulations (like the Pakistani factory aforementioned), among other things you take for granted. Okay, okay, pulling the fire alarm WAS funny the first time. 
Look, nobody is saying we should get rid of these garment factories, it’s the fact that they’re “sweatshops” that makes the difference. Heck, at moments like these, rivalry week ain’t nothing without my “fucla” shirt.
I will happily concede that, in a single instance, the use of a “you suck” argument would be childish. Here, I was going for more of a trope, though, and I wanted to give it a nice rhythm. Not my most articulate of moments, perhaps, but it appears that you noticed it, which was the intent.
As a strict capitalist who truly, honestly believes that the government should do nearly nothing (separate discussion), I would argue that economics is the only thing that matters in a globalized economy. However, I recognize that there are ethical concerns, and some of these have some modicum of legitimacy to them. Perhaps you would enjoy an article from Volume 13, Issue 2 of Business Ethics Quarterly: “Sweatshops and Respect for Persons.” You can find it on JSTOR. It lays out a Kantian analysis (yes, I recognize that my comment above disparages classes in such things as philosophy—I do stand by that argument) of sweatshops and their conditions. I suspect the extreme nature of SCALE’s demands when juxtaposed with this article will surprise you.
Let me put it this way: I understand that you advocate to modify certain behaviors at USC as a microcosm for larger-scale change that you support; however, I would urge you to consider rational, non-extremist positions and to engender a spirit of good neighborliness with those who disagree with you. You might actually get something done then. Speaking of which, whatever happened to that conflict-free minerals thing that dear Francesca submitted to USG? Is that being implemented? Oops.
Agreed wholeheartedly on the “FUCLA” shirt—if I see anyone I know named “Sam” wearing one this week, I’ll buy him a drink.
My question is what is “hate speech” ?
With the ADL sticking its nose where it doesn’t belong its version of hate speech is anything or any opinion they disagree with. That is the issue here. Certain topics are off limit for conversation such as the holocaust,  even though it should be discussed as a part of history and should be able to be questioned and scrutinized. As of now it is a holy temple of hands off conversation. Censoring CODOH is the ultimate example of cowardliness and a Jewish manipulation of free speech
No, targeting college students with hate speech like that of CODOH is cowardice, including trying to lead people to your page with your bs username.
“Joe Rizoli,” go back to peddling moon landing conspiracy theories.
GOOD argument, there, Ryan! Keep on punchin’.
By the way, George, I can see YOU haven’t fallen for that “Open Debate” ruse (and visited the pages you describe as “hate speech).” Keep yourself pure! Hate speech is hate speech – especially if you’ve never heard/read any of it.
I’m I hater, for sure! I hate lies – AND those who knowingly defend/perpetuate them. As for you, I suspect you’re a mere dupe (as I was, for longer than you’ve probably lived, yet). 
So I don’t hate you. I just hate what you defend.
Not too difficult to figure out that the same people denying the Holocaust are probably in line with those who deny 9/11 or other tragedies to forward some race-based agenda that led to major events like these in history.
But I’ll bite:
a) if you hate lies so much, why cast aside the mounting evidence in favor of conspiracy (a.k.a. delusion, lies)?
b) has the water near your home been tested?
Brad, I’ve long since accepted the mounting evidence that the Holocaust mythology is the product of an unholy conspiracy among the victorious Allies of World War II and the Zionists.
Surely YOU haven’t cast aside the evidence, have you?
Having as I do such a preponderance of evidence on my side, I have no temptation to engage in silly remarks about the water in your area. Such remarks are the brand of the weaker side of an argument.
Oh, they’re “unholy” Zionists now, are they? And I suppose all the death camps were just made up? And the Nuremberg trials were all for naught? Clearly, these people have achieved a disproportionate amount of power now through their manipulation *snicker*.
I could go on, but I don’t want to tempt you to keep filling the online space with garbage. The Daily Trojan, in this regard, is doing us all a favor, not just those that aren’t “aware” of the tragedy.
And, yes, it’s clear that my water remarks are much less mature than your entire argument. 
The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg was, in the words of Supreme Court Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, a “lynching party for Germans.” Although styled to resemble an actual trial (these have their own drawbacks, to be sure), the IMT was in fact theater to make it clear to all and sundry that the genocidal bombing attacks on the German population (and depredations on the home populations as well) were justified. They wouldn’t have hanged all those people just to make a point, now, would they (having just won a devastating war)?
If you put credence in the IMT, you probably believe the USS Maddox was attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964. And that Lee Harvey Oswald shot John Kennedy with a single well-placed shot from the Texas Schoolbook Depository. And on and on and on.
Believe on, Brother! It’s all dished up just for you!
Fine, here’s my question. Whether you’re correct or not, why do you care? I doubt it’s solely for the truth. Given the passion you have for this “cause” against so many innocent people, how does “their lie” (your words, not mine) affect you?
With freedom comes great responsibility. We are unraveling as a society where we hide behind free speech as a cover for bad behavior. If I thought you were skanky whore, should I be free to stand on the public sidewalk and inform all people walking to the church at your wedding that you are a skanky whore? If someone tries to stop me from doing this on your special day, isn’t that a violation of my free speech?
Similarly, it is too easily and quite frankly very cowardly to pick a special day when USC wants to celebrate its ground breaking and have it usurped by people looking to make trouble. 
What I find unclear about this article is are the 3 students upset because they have been associated with SCALE when in fact they have absolutely nothing to do with SCALE, or is the author stating even if the 3 students were part of SCALE and they wanted to protect – they should have been able to do so. I hate when college level students can not be clear about the simple points in their opinion because they quickly want to get to the part where they are shaking their fist at the MAN.
“What I find unclear about this article is are the 3 students upset because they have been associated with SCALE when in fact they have absolutely nothing to do with SCALE, or is the author stating even if the 3 students were part of SCALE and they wanted to protect – they should have been able to do so. I hate when college level students can not be clear about the simple points in their opinion because they quickly want to get to the part where they are shaking their fist at the MAN.”
I would say she’s making BOTH points. If SCALE had wanted to protest the groundbreaking (and quite frankly I don’t see what the groundbreaking has to do with labor issues, so they probably wouldn’t) they should have the freedom to. But these students weren’t even affiliated with SCALE, making it even worse, (esp. because one student was *allegedly* misidentified because of his race). Plus, I resent the idea that this author is “shaking [her] fist at the MAN.” Frankly this stuff matters. Don’t belittle it to be contrary.
Also Ras, if I was a skanky whore, I’d want you to tell me. Please don’t let me show up at my wedding in that state.
hugs and kisses,
Ryan
While this article underlines the issue of free speech in this incident, it also misses the issue of racial profiling that was part of this incident. Shepard was identified as a member of SCALE due to his race as he “looked like a leader in SCALE” and the other two doctoral students were involved due to them  taking concern about how Shepard was being treated. I think a more detailed article should be released that truly illuminates the entire story for those who aren’t familiar with what happened on our campus last week. This incident underscores several issues on this campus that we should all be aware of and hopefully USC is taking this seriously.
Great article. Dear Daily Trojan editors, please print more of these articles reflecting on important issues between students and our university. The idea of a free press is to hold power to account. And that means our university.
Under pressure from represented on-campus by the Hillel Foundation, and by the Anti-Defamation League, The Trojan (celebrating 100 years of . . . journalism) rejects paid advertising from the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust.
Amendments and written policies aside, this just IS NOT the practice of free speech. That free speech IS claimed to be practiced by California/USC/The Trojan, et al is just propaganda. If you believe that stuff, I’ve got a bridge you might be interested in buying.
Oh just shut up already and leave. No one wants to listen to you.
Anonymous, if YOU “just left,” nobody would miss YOU. After all, you are . . . nobody. Or anybody? Or?
Well, you’re discursive, anyway – anybody can see THAT.
By the way, I really don’t know who “wants to listen to me.” Or to you, either, your meaty content aside. And you don’t know, either. Just speak for yourself, would you? Like I do?
I’ll speak for myself: CODOH has about as much credence as the Westboro Baptist Church. There.
Anonymity is unrelated to nothingness; I have a well-defined identity, and I daresay many more people on this campus would miss me if I were to disappear than would miss you.
I find it hilarious that you, of all people, accuse me of being discursive. I am infinitely more credible than you and your pathetic excuse of an organization, and I truly hope that you continue to try and push your point. Eventually, perhaps, your spirit will give out and you will be left a crushed excuse for a human being. Well, more of an excuse than you already are.
The university policy is hypocritical at best.  It lauds free speech, as long as it does not interfere with its day to day operations, a standard that is so vague that it allows the university to silence anyone they want, and, in this case, to falsely detain 3 innocent students, with no consequences whatsoever for the administration, no accountability.
If we had free speech, there would not need to be a “Free speech zone” a few feet wide and deep by Tommy Trojan, there would just BE free speech.
The policy that says we have free speech unless we interfere with the day to day operations of the U. is in direct contradiction with the meaning of the first amendment.  in the words of justice Douglas, “a function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.”
Under Nikias’ version of free speech, we have free speech as long as it doesn’t disturb anyone, which is the antithesis of free speech.
Further, the lack of free speech prevents accountability and gives a sense of entitlement to administrators, who feel they can do whatever they want and not be held responsible, be it when they allow a shady promotion company to operate on campus, or when DPS treats people like absolute crap, as they usually do, and as they did with the 3 grad students at the opening ceremony: in Westwood, such illegal detention would have been actionable against the police and the university in a court of law (oh yeah, you can’t legally detain innocent people).  In contrast, at USC,  Nikias, Jackson et al. will continue to parade as if they own the place, and stifle students’ legitimate behavior.
This has to stop.  FREE SPEECH FOR USC!

On Nov. 5, students received an email from USC Housing detailing a new guest policy for on-campus residential buildings.
“Guests will still be allowed to visit [residents in their buildings],” read the email. “However, they will have to be signed in by a resident of the building and leave a valid ID in exchange for a temporary guest pass.”
Though this new policy aims to improve the security of buildings on campus, it is an inefficient and redundant system, and has raised considerable concern among students who live on campus. USC Housing should take these concerns seriously and reform the policy to not include students already entered in housing contracts with the university.
It is reasonable to require guests who are not affiliated with the university to register when staying overnight in a residence hall. This provides an incentive for off-campus, non-USC guests, who did not sign a housing contract, to adhere to USC Housing policy.
Keenan Cheung, director of USC Housing, explained in an email to the Daily Trojan, however, that a guest of a building is any person — university-affiliated or not — who is not a contracted resident of that particular building. These guests must sign in and exchange an ID for a guest pass, a change that differs from the current policy that only requires registration for overnight guests.
Extending the requirement of registration to include people affiliated with the university is unnecessary. The majority of visitors to on-campus residence buildings are USC students who have already signed a contract agreeing to abide by the rules dictated by USC Housing and the USC Student Code of Conduct.
As many students living on and off campus frequent other dormitories, the process of registering each one of these students and exchanging their IDs for guest passes will inevitably cause heavy congestion in building lobbies. Such congestion removes the ability of students to enter and leave dorms quickly to borrow a book or clothes from a friend, for example. It also makes group study ventures much more difficult. Requiring all members of a study group — who might be coming from different dorms — to spend several minutes registering as an outsider discourages students from using the study rooms in residence buildings.
In addition, requiring campus residents to register in other dorms seems unnecessary when the university is already stationing new security personnel at the entrances of on-campus residences to check IDs. If the policy aims to protect students against supposed invaders, requiring the registration of students serves no purpose.
USC Housing should amend the new guest policy requirement to address only guests who are not university-affiliated. The new 24-hour security staff can easily check IDs as a means of distinguishing between USC students and off-campus guests.
Not only would reforming the policy satisfy students, allowing for ease when having visitors, it would still meet the university’s need for greater security on campus. And it would be an admirable effort on USC Housing’s part to show that they are not only willing to work on and improve the campus’ residential housing experience, but to also listen and take into account student concerns.

North University Park and Twan should form their own club founded on irrelevance to article content and exaggeration.
U S C is building new student housing under its ” U S C Specific Plan ” in the hope and expectation that students will prefer university provided  housing with its rules and regulations over privately owned housing in the community.
Unless such housing is substantially subsidized I doubt that it will be successful
More likely, when the free market fails, freshman students will be forced to accept such housing, as has happened in other similar universities.
Given that the rents of the non-USC owned properties are pretty pricey anyway if you want to live anywhere near campus, I don’t see this new plan as a bad thing, especially if leases from these new properties are like those of other USC-managed properties: namely, not over the whole year, but rather during the semester.
Yeah, we unfortunately heard you in the other 20 threads in which you brought this up. Give it a rest.
The cat lady never shuts up!
You’re like a dog that comes running back every time someone kicks it. Just give it up already.
“Show me your papers young black males!”
The new profiling policy continues!
Man, you just don’t give up, do you? I wonder what it’s like to have a dialogue with myself, yet still post it for all to see.
Twan has to be a white guy who’s just messing with everyone. His posts are simply not real.
Twat,
It does not matter if you are trolling for attention or really believe what you write — there is a reason you and I walk on the other side of the street when hooded black men are walking hard with hoodies late at night. I  also love when young black men deliberately try and look hard at people so when whitey reacts by crossing the street – then the young blacks can have a war story to tell the world how racist a society we live in.
Listen to you people:
1) I don’t have a legitimate point about how young black men are treated?
2) I could only be a “white guy” messing with everyone?
3) You call me “Twat”?
4) You refer to the actions of black men as “hard with hoodies”
Your bigotry again shows for all to see!
Who cares if they’re treated differently? Face it—empirical evidence has irrefutably demonstrated the effectiveness of profiling.
Agreed. Also, let’s not forget that the contract all USC Housing residents signed at the beginning of the year outlines  the guest policy, and that these new measures are in violation of that policy. The contract states that the only guests that must check in with the front desk are ones staying overnight, and that no guest can stay for more than three consecutive nights. The USC Housing director is trying to pass off these new measure by saying that obeying new rules regarding checking in and receiving a guest pass fall under the portion of the contract that obligate guests to follow USC rules of conduct. Keenan specifically cited this passage:
“The Resident shall be fully responsible for the
conduct of his/her guests and for informing the guest of any University rules and regulations pertaining to conduct within the Premises or the Building.”
However, “conduct” here is referring to guest behavior and can’t be used as a blanket clause to include any new rule or stipulation housing wants to throw on us. These policies don’t legally check out.
This is what I would be talking about if I were still living in a USC Housing facility. Also, I would be making inquiries into the procedures involving the collection of biometric information. Who wrote them? Who audited them? Is there an outside group evaluating the manner in which the data is being handled? I doubt it—USC Housing lacks pretty much all credibility (and integrity) in my mind.

On Saturday, Metro, in coordination with Caltrans and other mobility partners, began a one-year demonstration to develop solutions for improving traffic flow on the I-10 and I-110 freeways.
The prominent component of this demonstration involved converting stretches of carpool lanes on both freeways to express lanes, which are accessible to single drivers for a fee, but remain free for those carpooling. The I-110 will make the conversion first, with the I-10 freeway to follow next year.
The new express lanes on I-110 are located between Adams Boulevard and 91 freeway. All individuals using the Express lanes will be required to mount an ExpressLanes FasTrak transponder on their vehicles at a cost of $40, although solo drivers with existing FastTrak transponders may continue using it to gain access to the express lanes.
Drivers who intend to carpool are advised to obtain a switchable transponder for $40, which allows drivers to indicate the number of occupants in the vehicle.
Metro will vary its toll rate, according the organization’s website, resulting in tolls ranging from 25 cents a mile to $1.40 a mile during peak traffic hours. Members of the AAA and low-income individuals will receive discounts on tolls.
For students and professors who routinely commute to USC’s University Park Campus, this project could have a significant impact as the converted stretch of I-110 lies in close proximity to university park campus. Metro had no plans to instate a student discount on for the toll roads. They were contacted for the comments on concerning future plans for student discounts, but were unavailable due to the Veteran’s Day holiday.
In a press release, Undergraduate Student Government Commuter Senator Adam Prohoroff explained the tradeoffs that would result from the conversion. He noted that the toll lanes would be inaccessible to many commuting students, as they would not be able to afford the toll.
“Many current commuter students can’t afford to live on campus,” he said, “so they would be financially unable to use the new lanes.”
Prohoroff noted the toll roads would be beneficial to those who carpool or use Metro’s Vanpool Program, however.
In a press release, LA County Supervisor and Metro Board Member Mark Ridley-Thomas said the project would be beneficial to everyone. According to Ridley-Thomas, the project would distribute traffic more evenly across the roads, which results in less traffic for everyone, including those not paying the toll.
“When solo drivers begin to travel on the 110 ExpressLanes, all commuters will benefit — whether they pay a toll or not — because the ExpressLanes will redistribute traffic across all lanes of the 110 freeway,” Ridley-Thomas said. “Shifting solo drivers who are willing to pay tolls into the empty space in the ExpressLanes will speed commuting time and travel for all drivers. Everyone wins when freeway traffic flows more smoothly.”
Students like Adam Greenway, a sophomore majoring in business administration who used the toll road this weekend, feel the lanes will have an impact on the times when they choose to travel.
“I will be more cautious about what times I will drive at. I will try to avoid rush hour more than usual.” Greenway said. “There’s no train or bus system that goes to my house, so I’m kind of limited to my car.”
Greenway still believed, however, that the toll road was a step in the right direction, although he didn’t appreciate the $40 transponder fee.
“I actually thought it was a good idea in principle. I’ve seen rush hour and it can be pretty bad,” Greenway said, “but my biggest complaint is that those with more than two or more persons have to get the transponder and pay a fee for it, even though they’re using [the road] for free.”

Though an on-campus shooting last week prompted a slew of new safety measures, many high school seniors applying to USC are not more concerned about safety on the University Park Campus.
USC Admissions did not respond to an immediate interview request, but the Frequently Asked Questions section address safety concerns by mentioning the Dept. of Public Safety patrol route, University Tram Service, Campus Cruiser, DPS’s pamphlet on safety called “Street Smarts” and crime statistics.
“On any college campus, the level of crime is affected by enrollment, geographic size, location and other factors,” the FAQ says. “USC’s University Park and Health Sciences campuses are among the safest in the country. They are located in residential neighborhoods that include major museums, historic buildings, local schools, fraternity and sorority houses, and family homes.”
Suzanne Rubenstein, a private college counselor in the Los Angeles area, said concern about safety tends to vary between families, but that students often reflect their parents’ concerns. She said campus visits tend to be a large factor in the perception of safety.
“The safety of the surrounding neighborhood is an issue for families, but not specifically to USC,” Rubenstein said. “I have had kids go to Berkeley who said they have walked down Telegraph Avenue and that it made them uncomfortable. It really just depends on the student.”
The shooting, which injured four, occurred at about 11:45 p.m. on Oct. 31 outside of a Halloween party in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Many high school seniors said the shooting did not give them pause about applying to USC.
“I know that [USC] is not in the best of areas, but I know that the campus does an overall good job of security,” said Matt Lilli, a senior at Mountain View High School in El Monte. “It’s not a huge factor because there’s always the potential to not be safe wherever you go, so it’s up to you to have common sense.”
Hailey Carter, a senior at Canyon Crest Academy in Encinitas, also said she and her parents are not concerned about safety on USC’s campus.
“It doesn’t really affect my decision because, for the most part, I know USC is safe and has a lot of security,” Carter said. “If there’s a shark attack it’s not going to stop me from surfing because that’s rare. It’s the same sort of thing.”
Andy Tan, a high school senior in Taipei, Taiwan, said he and his parents are not concerned about safety at USC, though safety is a general concern when applying to schools. Tan acknowledged that USC is not in the best area, but said this did not factor into his decision to apply.
A parent in Manhattan Beach, Kathy Kernochan, whose son, Connor, is applying to USC this year, said the safety of her son is a concern when considering which college he might attend, but that USC doesn’t seem to be particularly dangerous.
“I know that [crime] can happen anywhere,” Kernochan said. “It’s certainly in the back of my mind, but I’m not going to dwell on it because you know it could happen anywhere.”
Students near Los Angeles tend to have a better idea of safety concerns in the area around USC. Gail Curry, a counselor at Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, said she tells concerned parents to go to ope.ed.gov/security and view crime reports for individual campuses, though most of her students visit USC because it is nearby.
“[Mira Costa’s students] realize how safe it is because they can visit,” Curry said. “They see that if you’re on campus, there is security and it’s pretty safe, but realize that if you go too far off campus you might be in an area that might be unsafe.”
Pateese Terry, a senior at Walter Payton College Preparatory High School in Chicago, said she has wanted to apply to USC for several years, and intends to visit USC’s campus at some point to determine how safe it is.
“When I heard about the shooting on campus, it came as a shock because I hadn’t heard of anything happening [at USC] and I didn’t think safety would be a concern,” Terry said. “Safety is very important to me. I want to make sure I go to a school where I can feel safe walking around.”
Madeleine Wright, a senior at Sacramento Country Day School in Sacramento, said safety is a concern for her and her mother, but that she understands some crimes are going to occur in urban areas.
“I know that USC has a reputation of being in a sketchier neighborhood, so when I heard about the shootings last year, I didn’t associate them with the university,” Wright said. “When something happens, it’s unfortunate, but I don’t think it’s the university’s fault. You go to a school to get a good education … Safety is a part of the equation, but it isn’t the basis of my decision.”

The USC Trojan Marching Band agreed Tuesday that its drum major will not stab the midfield logo at the request of the UCLA Athletic Department prior to Saturday’s rivalry football game against the No. 17 Bruins at the Rose Bowl.
The Trojan Marching Band released a statement Tuesday, saying its director Arthur C. Bartner had reached the decision after meeting with UCLA game management.
The conflict over the tradition of stabbing the field before the start of each game started when the UCLA athletic department requested the act be taken out of the annual crosstown rivalry game.
The drum major, dressed as a Trojan, typically stabs the field with a sword as part of a pregame ritual for all home games at the Los Angles Memorial Coliseum, as well as some road games, such as California, Notre Dame, Stanford and UCLA.
Bartner said the recent decision stemmed from his desire to continue cordial relations with UCLA.
“It is important to protect a great rivalry and to conduct it in the most mutually respectful way possible,” Bartner said in the statement.
The band also dispelled rumors that it has been asked to not play “Tusk” on its Twitter account Tuesday afternoon.
Good grief!  Just how far is this nicey nicey political correctness going to go in the liberalized college world today?
Fight On!
