Before I arrived in Shanghai, I heard about an opportunity to teach English at a migrant school and immediately knew it was something I wanted to do. Through a non-profit organization called Stepping Stones, I, along with many other volunteers, teach English to grade school students at various migrant schools in Shanghai. Shanghai actually has one of the highest concentrations of migrants in China. These migrants generally move from farmlands and agricultural areas into cities. In recent years, the government has created many new migrant schools to provide the children with access to education they may otherwise not be receiving. In theory, the idea is a good one, but there are still many underlying issues affecting the quality of education these students are receiving.
Stepping Stones placed me at Huabo Lixing Hang School, an elementary school about an hour away from campus. When I first arrived, I immediately noticed that the area was much poorer than the area I lived in and went to school in, and its inhabitants looked different from Shanghainese people. Most migrants, which I find easily distinguishable from the Shanghainese, come from inland provinces such as Anhui, Hunan and Sichuan.
The school, chartered by the government, clearly stood out from the rest of the environment. Its modern architecture seemed out of place among the poorer buildings and shops surrounding it. The classes were packed with students. A normal class size is around 60. This made teaching English incredibly difficult because the students were often distracted by their many classmates, or had trouble understanding what was occurring at the front of the classroom.
The students, though clearly excited to learn, were very rowdy and greatly varied in their English abilities. This is common characteristic in migrant schools, as students who weren’t born in Shanghai have had a range of educational experiences in their hometowns. One of the Chinese volunteers who works with me in the classroom actually told me that her elementary school was nothing like this. She said everyone was always well-behaved because parents reinforced their children’s behavior at home. Migrant children, whose parents often work late, have very different home lives, and these differences translate into the classroom.
I’ve only volunteered twice so far, and although the experiences are exhausting, they’re also extremely rewarding and fun. I know that the difference I’m making by interacting with the students and providing them with more opportunities to practice their English, though small, will be beneficial in the long run. I’m also taking a sociology class at my university in Shanghai and one of the topics we have covered is Chinese migrants, so it’s really interesting to see the intersection of what I’m learning in class with one of the extracurricular activities I’m involved in.
When you’re abroad, it’s easy to get wrapped up in traveling and the novelty of an unfamiliar city and forget all the other activities you can get involved in. But getting involved while abroad will not only allow you to see another country’s take on extracurricular activities, it will also open your eyes to the happenings and opportunities in another region of the world.

I was always told that going to college would be the best time of my life. So far it is definitely wonderful, but I haven’t reached a final conclusion on if that statement is true.  
One of the main reasons for this stage being so exciting is that you are at a very special age. You are old enough to do adult things, but young enough to not have all of adults’ responsibilities. Your main duty is to study — which is no small feat — and that gives you a lot of freedom. But in order to make the best of this freedom, having the support of your university is vital.
University is supposed to be more than classes and exams. We are not here only to get ready to find a job. We are here to find our personality and to find our own way of thinking. Finding that is undoubtedly very hard, but as far as I am concerned, I think that USC has managed to do it pretty well, or at least better than the universities I know of in Spain.
You are not a USC student, you are a Trojan. It all starts there. Since Owen R. Bird (I recently found about him and his story is definitely worth a look) gave this name to the University back in 1912, a strong identity started forming. Besides a healthy habit, sport is a great educational tool and an amazing way to unite all students to represent and support their university. If you want to make all these people proud of the place where they study, hosting events like tailgates before a football game is a very effective way to do it — and it’s a lot of fun, too.
However, it is not only about sports. What about this very blog, Troy Meets World? Something like this would not be possible at my Spanish university, since we do not have a newspaper in which it could be published. The Daily Trojan provides stories for students, written by students, and that makes it a unique publication. It contains articles that could not be found anywhere else.
Another thing I love about USC (and many other American universities) is how student associations are fostered. The student involvement fair at the beginning of the semester was astonishing. Obviously there are also student organizations at my home university, but they do not have such an impact. Even though students will and commitment is what really makes an association big, infrastructure is needed as well. The more resources your university gives you, the more encouraged you will be to start up a new project. In fact, things that change the world are not usually created while doing math problems, but when you let your mind free, without restrictions.
I guess that one of the reasons extracurricular activities are more important here is that universities are simply bigger and, therefore, they gather more people (everything in the United States is a size XL compared to Europe, and universities are no exception). Despite the fact that bigger institutions normally have more resources, I think a little bit of perspective and strategy is important too, so I will try to bring some of that back to Spain. In the end, we can never forget that education and involvement at your university, is not an expense, but an investment.

The USC Career Center is a helpful place to start when looking for internships. Alina Tang | Daily Trojan
It may be only late October, but it never hurts to start thinking about summer plans. Many companies are already doing heavy-duty recruitment on college campuses, and USC is no exception. In the last few weeks, the Career Center has become a hub of students shuffling between information sessions and interviews. But don’t fret! Below are some tips on how to score your dream summer internship.
1. APPLY APPLY APPLY
Applying is always the first step, and it’s arguably the hardest part of the process. But once you’ve compiled a list of potential companies and submitted your first application, the rest will come easy. My advice is to always keep quality in mind. While applying to more positions increases your likelihood of landing an internship, all your efforts will be in vain if recruiters can tell you haven’t put in thought. Make sure you personalize every application by tailoring your resume and cover letter to each position.  
2. Research the company
This seems like an obvious suggestion, but it is never emphasized enough. Researching a company is not just looking up the mission statement or memorizing annual revenue figures. Recruiters are always more impressed when you know unique corporate information because it leads to more interesting questions and dialogue. During one of my most successful interviews, I mentioned that I read about the CEO’s plans to expand in China. The recruiter and I ended up discussing globalization and Asian consumer markets for half an hour, and I could tell I made a positive first impression that way.
3. Reach out to personal connections
When you applied for college, you probably sought the advice of dozens of other people. Choosing a summer internship is a lot like choosing a university — you want to find out as much as possible beyond corporate facts and figures that can be found online. I recommend talking to professors, mentors, friends, older students and anyone who has had prior internship or work experience at the company. You can ask them what a typical work day is like, how they enjoyed the work culture and who they reached out to for guidance. These are things only someone who went through the same experience can tell you.
4. Practice answering questions
Many interviewers use situational questions to assess a candidate’s potential fit with the company. To prepare for these, you should think of some strong personal anecdotes that can be applied to different scenarios. For example, think of a time when you had to juggle multiple responsibilities or a time you had to deal with a difficult team member. By anticipating the type of questions you might receive, you can tailor your responses to match what the company seeks while still revealing your own uniqueness.
5. Give yourself a background check
Most college students have a strong online presence from their Facebook profile and/or Instagram feed. Take a look at your past content and make sure none of it is inappropriate or distasteful. A precautionary measure is to change your privacy settings so not everyone can access your pictures, posts and statuses.
6. Be yourself
Finally, take the time to think about how you and the company you are applying to can mutually benefit from employing you. You are interviewing the company as much as the company is interviewing you, so make sure you really evaluate your desire to work for them because it will show. Once you establish a genuine interest, it will be much easier to be authentic and personable in your interview, so always stay true to yourself.
