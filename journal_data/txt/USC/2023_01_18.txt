The University is naming one of its sports fields in honor of USC alumna Allyson Felix, an Olympian who earned the most Olympic medals of any track and field athlete in United States history, President Carol Folt announced Wednesday.
Already a professional runner by the time she attended USC, Felix pursued an undergraduate degree in education while beginning her tenure at the World Championships, where she became the most decorated athlete with 20 medals, seven from individual events and 13 from team relays. Her 4×400 gold medal win at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo — the fifth consecutive Olympic games where she medaled — marked her 11th medal overall and broke her tie with Carl Lewis as the most decorated track and field athlete in American history.
“The Allyson Felix Field will recognize her immense achievements as a sports legend and Trojan — while also showing our admiration for her role as an entrepreneur, advocate and champion for women,” Folt said in a press release. “My hope is that students playing on the Allyson Felix Field — or just walking by — will see her name prominently displayed and be curious to learn more about her talent, grit and generosity.”
Previously known as Cromwell Field and located at the center of the Katherine B. Loker Stadium, the field serves as a central hub for the men’s and women’s track and field teams, as well as for recreational sports and groups, including the Trojan Marching Band and the ROTC. The field was originally named after Dean Cromwell, USC’s track and field coach from 1909 to 1948 who coached the team to 12 national track and field championships. 
Cromwell is associated with the removal of two Jewish athletes from the relay team during the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, a move that many athletes later said was fueled by anti-Semitism. In his book, “Championship Techniques in Track and Field,” Cromwell also described Black athletes as “primitive.”
“We’re in an evolving process as a University,” Folt said in an interview with the Daily Trojan Wednesday. “There are many, many parts of the University that haven’t been named that people have strong opinions about.”
The naming pays tribute to Felix’s ties to the University and to Los Angeles, her hometown. Quoted in the press release, Felix recalled taking walks around campus with her grandmother and older brother as a little girl. Her brother went on to graduate from USC and she followed in his footsteps.
“For me to be born and raised in Los Angeles and have such a history at USC, I am just completely humbled,” Felix said. “It’s such a huge honor to be a part of history in the campus, and it’s such a special place for me.”
In addition to her successful career as an athlete, Felix is also an advocate for women’s rights and has brought attention to the issues facing athletes of color. Felix became vocal about the unequal conditions BIPOC athletes face compared to white athletes during contract negotiations after personal experience opened her eyes to the injustice. Felix was also inspired to advocate in support of maternal health, including raising awareness of the higher burden of poor pregnancy outcomes among Black women and high child care costs, after becoming a mother in 2018.
Paula Cannon, an associate professor of microbiology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC who leads the renaming committee for the University, called Felix “the ultimate Trojan” in the press release.
“For me to be born and raised in Los Angeles and have such a history at USC, I am just completely humbled.”
“[Felix] graduated with a degree from Rossier, crushed it at multiple Olympics and international competitions and bravely stood up for what she knew was right when her employer did not,” Cannon said. “It will be so wonderful that the field she walked around as a little girl from the neighborhood will be named in her honor.”
Folt also noted the historical significance of Felix, whom she said was a “beautiful example” of Trojan values, being chosen for the field’s renaming.
“We haven’t had many women or people of color who have been in our most honored positions on buildings and names over time,” Folt said. “I love that we did this during fifty years of Title IX. There’s all sorts of wonderful connections.”
Felix said she believes the multifaceted reasoning behind the renaming, an honor usually reserved for major donors, makes it even more special to her. 
“To have discussions about the renaming [of the track] because of my character, my integrity, and for fighting for women, is something that doesn’t happen,” Felix said. “It just really shows what USC values. I feel proud of the things that I’ve stood for, and it makes me proud to be an alumna because of the direction the school is going.”
Last year, Felix received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from USC and delivered the Class of 2022 commencement speech. In her speech, she emphasized that “there are times when you’ll ask for change, and there are times when you’ll have to create it.”
The University will hold a formal dedication of the newly renamed “Allyson Felix Field” this spring.

California now requires employers with at least fifteen workers to report salary ranges in job postings, as of Jan. 1. It is not the first or only state to do so: Similar laws in Washington and Rhode Island also went into effect at the turn of the new year, joining Nevada, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland and a handful of cities and counties. USC, the second-largest private employer in Los Angeles County with 28,119 faculty, staff and student workers as of the 2021-22 academic year, is also subject to the new law.
Wages have been a subject of contention at the University for several years, recently spotlighted in April, when janitors contracted under Aramark protested alongside students and faculty members for higher wages and better healthcare benefits. Graduate student workers are also in the process of unionizing in hopes of negotiating for higher compensation, following a national reckoning over universities’ treatment of academic workers spurred by a historic strike across University of California campuses.
The Daily Trojan compiled and analyzed data for 50 recent USC job postings at the date of publication, taking into consideration the position, department and hourly wages or salaries. Postings are from Jan. 2-9. Also included in the analysis are 100 other job postings from Nov. 22 to Dec. 30, compiled and posted to Reddit by a graduate student who granted permission to use their data set and requested to remain anonymous due to privacy concerns. 
Postings from the Keck School of Medicine have been excluded from both data sets because of the large quantity of open positions, out-of-state positions that are not subject to the new law and different regulations for minimum wages and benefits. Not all USC departments are reflected in the data. 
A model created by Dr. Amy Glasmeier, professor of economic geography and regional planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calculates the living wage for a single adult with no children living in L.A. County to be $21.89 an hour. This, according to the model, is the minimum an individual must earn to support themself, assuming they work full-time — 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year.
Six of the fifty most recent postings, all of them within Auxiliary Services, offer significantly less than this calculated living wage. A “Culinary Specialist” at Burger Crush makes $19.92 an hour. A host at the University Club would earn $18.77 an hour. Two postings, including one for a hotel service worker position, pay exactly the L.A. city minimum wage, at $16.04 an hour.
Last year’s postings paint a fuller picture. Five of nine Auxiliary Services positions listed are below the Glasmeier model’s living wage, including a Trojan Grounds Starbucks cashier position at $18.84 an hour. Financial Business Services offers $19.84 for a mail and material handler and $20.49 for an accounting assistant. An associate child care teacher at University Relations would earn $16.58, just over half a dollar more than minimum wage and far below the city-wide average for a child care teacher, at $25.27.
A majority of these positions do not require a college degree; in contrast, the University often offers competitive, if not above-average, salaries for positions that do require a bachelor’s degree or above. A deputy chief information officer at Information Technology Services can earn anywhere between $300,000 and $350,000, either way almost double the city’s average for such a position. A senior project manager position at the USC Credit Union just about hits the average mark at $132,591.50.
The University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan Thursday that it is “committed to maintaining institutional compliance with all laws, including those relating to minimum wage and pay transparency.”
“When extending an offer of employment, the University considers factors such as (but not limited to) the scope and responsibilities of the position, the candidate’s work experience, education/training, key skills, internal peer equity, federal, state and local laws, contractual stipulations, grant funding, as well as external market and organizational considerations,” the statement read.
Wages offered for Auxiliary Services positions are mostly union-bargained, a University spokesperson said, and are coupled with benefits packages for employees and their families in accordance with negotiated contracts. Offers for hospitality positions also take tips into consideration, the spokesperson said. 
A spokesperson for UNITE HERE Local 11, a union representing USC hospitality workers, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Some businesses have responded to the new pay transparency law by exploiting weaknesses in its wording to their advantage. Big Tech companies, in a precedented move, posted excessively wide salary ranges: an L4 software engineer position at Netflix now offers anywhere between $90,000 and $900,000, which the company justified as the “overall market range for roles in this area.” Tesla employed a similar strategy, offering $104,000 to $348,000 for its own software engineer position. 
USC, meanwhile, is including its pay ranges only after an introduction and five or six other sections, including the job description and necessary qualifications. A typical posting for Auxiliary Services lists the range after about 700 to 900 words, which is similar to the length of this article. Information Technology Services postings have almost 1,300 words before the range appears. 
Whereas other listings — including the $90,000 to $900,000 Netflix position — separate the range as a standalone paragraph, University positions include it within a paragraph that reads exactly like the University’s Thursday statement. The result is a job posting with no immediately visible statement of a pay range. 
The University declined to comment on the matter, instead referring to a Mar. 29 memo from President Carol Folt on “long-term plans for increasing faculty and staff compensation,” including a $700 million investment “over the next five years to support performance-based salary increases, related employee benefits, and market adjustments.”
“Our strategy is to bolster the excellence and innovation of our academic programs, strengthen our workforce, retain critical talent, ensure our job descriptions describe current roles and responsibilities, address compensation inequities, and systematically raise salaries to be competitive in one of the country’s most expensive job markets,” the memo read.

The Undergraduate Student Government discussed a proposal to change the name of the Latinx Student Assembly to the Latine Student Assembly during its Senate meeting Tuesday night. Cristal Molina, LSA co-executive director, Anacristina Perry, LSA co-executive director and Melissa Ayala, LSA assistant director, said they believed the name change was necessary to better represent the Latine community and to achieve their goals of gender and language inclusivity.
“Latinx was created mostly by English speakers using a sound ending in the letter ‘x’ that doesn’t really exist within the Spanish language,” Molina said. “‘Latine’ works both in English and Spanish … A lot of feedback we’ve gotten from the Latine community is that we aren’t super inclusive of Spanish speakers currently, so we’re working on a rebrand for our board.”
The Senate unanimously approved the name change. 
Chief of Staff Diego Andrades announced that the budget allocation committee is currently reviewing USG’s spending during the fall semester to reallocate funding, which changes each semester because of enrollment changes — such as spring admits. 
The committee’s main focus is providing funding for the Joint Assembly of Military-Associated Students and Middle Eastern and North African Student Association. They have exhausted all funds from their trial semester and have no additional funding for the spring. 
“This is also quite difficult,” Andrades said. “Right now, the process does not set aside money for the spring semester for assemblies in the trial period. In the future we’d like more flexibility so we’re reevaluating the process to make it more equitable for these assemblies during future incorporation processes.”
Senator Yoav Gillath presented successful programs from the fall, including the Dining Dollar Donation Program through Trojans Give Back, a group that allows students to donate unused dining dollars at the end of the semester, which raised $14,000. This followed the launch of the pilot program in May 2022, which raised $12,000. 
“On the surface that looks like a $2,000 increase, [but] there were actually a lot less Dining Dollars in the system this semester,” Gillath said. “Percentage wise, that is a huge increase.”
With this success behind them, Gillath said, USC Hospitality is committed to making the Trojans Give Back program permanent and the drives annual. 
Another project Gillath worked on included sunscreen distribution to residents of Skid Row with the help of Cathartic, a nonprofit that connects suppliers with local community-facing organizations for equitable health and hygiene, and other organizations on campus. Gillath said the groups distributed more than 20 boxes of sunscreen to the unhoused population, who are disproportionately affected by health conditions such as skin cancer.
Gillath said he is also in discussion with the University’s administration to explore the possibility of expanding the Fryft zone to provide safer options for students to reach certain “corridors” throughout Los Angeles. Efforts to restore the previous single-rider system are also underway, he said.
Senator Sam Nadol resigned from his post and will be replaced with Blayke Bridge, a sophomore majoring in public policy. 
Andrades also reflected on this past semester in his role as chief of staff. Andrades said he wants to focus on fostering good relationships, creating more thorough plans, improving time management and communicating well if things don’t go as planned. 
The campaign period for the upcoming USG election will begin Jan. 23 at midnight, and the candidates will be announced at 10 a.m. the same day. The application for write-in-candidates is open on the USG website and will be due Feb. 10 at 11:59 p.m. The voting period will be from Feb. 21-26.
“I want to make sure that the senators who are coming in after us have the tools to be successful from day one,” Gillath said. “They’ve got to be ready to get off the ground running and get those projects going.”
Sign-ups for the restaurant crawl project will open in the next few weeks. The Black Student Assembly restaurant crawl will be held Feb. 10 and the Asian American restaurant crawl will be held Feb. 24. 
“Those two restaurant crawls will happen in the month,” Andrades said. “[Buses] will take students to restaurants that are local, so [we’re also] giving back to the local community.”

As students return to campus for the Spring 2023 semester, Student Health is slowly making a return to a normal campus, albeit with caution.
In a briefing with the Daily Trojan Tuesday, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said that the removal of Trojan Check tents and relaxation of the coronavirus isolation policy at the beginning of the Spring 2023 semester are consistent with other peer institutions.
USC removed Trojan Check tents from Trousdale Parkway at the start of the semester, yet another signal that campus is returning to its pre-coronavirus protocol. Van Orman said that though the Trojan Check program has not been in operation since March 2022, the tents remained during the remainder of the year. 
“In the course of a novel pandemic, we didn’t know what was coming,” Van Orman said. “And I think just in the interest of caution, that infrastructure stayed up in case there was a change in the public health conditions that necessitated moving that back.” 
Van Orman said it “became clear” over the course of the Fall 2022 semester that moving back to stricter coronavirus protocols would likely no longer be necessary, so Student Health opted to remove the Trojan Check tents.
“It’s starting to look more and more like pre-pandemic times, although we urge caution,” Van Orman said. “[Coronavirus] is still a leading cause of death, hospitalization and severe illness, and so I think we will never be without it. But we hope we can get back to most of our lives looking normal, including here at USC.”
Student Health also updated its coronavirus isolation policy over winter break, no longer requiring students living in on-campus apartments to quarantine if they test positive for the coronavirus. Students in residence halls with large shared bathrooms, such as New North or Pardee Tower, are still required to quarantine in University-provided isolation rooms. All students are still required to follow other isolation procedures, including quarantining at their own residence and not going to classes or dining halls while sick.
“If [students] are in a situation and they don’t feel comfortable doing that, there is still hotel isolation space available for those students on campus,” Van Orman said. “But that was a relaxation of the policy, recognizing that, for many people, they can isolate in place.”
The University is also no longer providing isolation housing for students living off campus, Van Orman said.
“This is consistent with the fact that for most people, given the level of infection, the availability of antivirals [and] the vaccination rates, isolation in place is now a more appropriate strategy than it was a year ago,” Van Orman said. 
Van Orman said she expects University coronavirus cases to mirror those of Los Angeles County. Hospitalizations in L.A. County are beginning to decline. Case counts for the last two weeks were lower than at the end of the Fall 2022 semester, with just about 100 cases for each of those weeks.
Currently, coronavirus cases mostly consist of the older variants, including BA.4 and BA.5. The new XBB.1.5 variant, termed the “Kraken” variant, is not yet predominant on campus or within L.A. County.
“Our precautions remain the same for everyone on campus: students, faculty and staff,” Van Orman said. “We did advise people coming back from travel to mask because we didn’t want a lot of [XBB.1.5] being imported from students coming back from break.”
Student Health also continues to monitor vaccination and booster rates, Van Orman said. Currently, 96% of undergraduates have the primary series vaccines and one booster shot, while 14% of undergraduate students have chosen to also get the bivalent booster. Meanwhile, 60% of faculty have gotten the bivalent booster in addition to the primary series and earlier boosters.
“[The bivalent booster] is just a recommendation, and the recommendation is stronger for people who are older or who have underlying health conditions,” Van Orman said.

The new Netflix docuseries “Break Point” is about the most advanced tennis players in the world, but this show is good for the beginner tennis fan. Whether you have watched tennis since you were a kid or only know the name Serena Williams, this series can appeal to anyone. The first five episodes of the ten episode series were released on Jan. 13. They give an in-depth look into a handful of highly ranked athletes as they travel around the world competing for major tournament victories. 
This show was made by the same creators of “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” a documentary that introduced a sport and its leading competitors to the world in an unprecedented format. “Break Point” follows the same formula as “Drive to Survive” as it focuses on the sport’s most notable players. Players such as Matteo Berrettini, Taylor Fritz, Maria Sakkari and Paula Badosa were given the spotlight in various episodes. Instead of simply stringing together a highlight reel, these shows focus on athletes’ lives off of the court. Specifically, the mental barriers and consistent training needed to even step on these courts. 
“Break Point” navigates around name dropping tennis legends like Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic. With a few exceptions, the names focused on in this series are those climbing world rankings and in the process of building a name for themselves. 
Yet the fight for notability is candidly portrayed as a lonely experience. Tennis is an utterly solitary sport as the athlete has no team to lean on, hide behind or even be the star of. The burden of loss, elation of victory and everything in between is experienced solely by the player with millions of eyes on them.
With a different athlete spotlighted in every episode, there are an array of personalities shown. In episode one, the attention fell on Australian player, Nick Kyrgios. Kyrgios, as well as any person close to him, will attest to the fact that who he is on the court is very different from who he is off of it. Many of the athletes show that they all possess a split personality depending on setting. There is an apparent juxtaposition of personas, creating a layered internal dynamic that sends media into a frenzy. Getting to see the mental aspect of sports and watching an unintentional deep dive into the psychologies of the athletes made this show an absolutely captivating watch. 
With every episode I found myself rooting for a new protagonist. Each player is there because they have not accomplished everything they set out to do, striving to obtain elusive titles and spots in rankings. 
The pressure placed on these athletes serves as a fine line between serving as a motivation and a deterrent. There is an indescribable amount of pressure on an athlete when they are in the process of making a name for themselves, but even more so when they defend the name they so proudly built. Defending a reputation and fortifying a legacy is a grueling task, but as the athletes demonstrated in “Break Point,” this process is also absolutely addicting.  
“Break Point” captured the fascinating mental struggle athletes navigate. It candidly answers the question of, “when your entire identity revolves around one thing, what happens when you are not the best?” 
If you are an avid tennis fan, then you would understand the intricacies of the sport better than I ever could watching this. However, after watching all five episodes, it is apparent that “Break Point” was constructed for the viewer who doesn’t know what’s coming. That suspense kept stringing me along throughout the show. I would imagine watching “Break Point” as an avid tennis fan would feel the same as watching a movie after already looking up the spoilers.

It’s been 254 days since my favorite K-pop group last released an album. Although their 2022 EP “minisode 2: Thursday’s Child” fulfilled my yearning for fresh bangers, five songs can only be replayed so many times before they lose their charm. I’ve been in need of some new music from them for a while. 
On Dec. 15, TXT made its official announcement for their upcoming release “The Name Chapter: TEMPTATION,” and the MOA, the name for the group’s fanbase and part of my self identity, emerged from hibernation. Their release is scheduled for Jan. 27 at 9 p.m. PST, and as you might imagine, my calendar is marked and my alarms are set.
One of the reasons why I’m such a raging fanatic of TXT, formally known as TOMORROW X TOGETHER, is because of the diversity of their concepts. As most K-pop stans know, every group tends to have a “concept” that pertains to their specific music, visuals, album design and choreography. 
For example, BLACKPINK tends to stick to more techno and dance music with simple beats and music videos. Stray Kids tends to align with more bass-driven rhythms alongside grungy yet polished music videos. NCT 127 tends to capitalize on “noise music” and hip-hop-esque music videos. 
But TXT? They could literally throw anything at you. And it’ll be great every time.
Take for instance their famous “Blue Hour” era. MOA were gifted a happy, bubbly music video with, among other unforgettable facets, cowboy hats, chaps and — wait for it — Choi Yeonjun with a pink mullet and pink cropped Balenciaga sweater. It was revolutionary. 
But if carousels, blue skies and sing-songy melodies don’t fit your style, then try venturing into their “Good Boy Gone Bad,” affectionately abbreviated by fans as “GBGB,” era. You’ll be graced by heavy rock, a deep black aesthetic and impeccable choreography. I promise it’s the same five guys from before.
They’re honestly the only group that I’m familiar with that is able to oscillate between concepts so often and so successfully. If a group finds a concept that is unique and popular with fans, that’s obviously what they usually stick to. But for some reason, TXT really likes to push their limits. 
Luckily, the group released concept photos for the approaching comeback, and to call the photos breathtaking would be a massive understatement. 
There are four versions of this album — K-Pop albums always come in different “versions” aka visual concepts; it’s a money-grab technique that fans, including myself, are extremely susceptible to) “Daydream,” “Nightmare,” “Farewell” and “Lullaby.” Each version is extremely unique in its own right, but even just flipping through the different pictures says a lot about not only TXT as a group, but their ability to welcome androgyny with exquisite artistry in something as standard as an album release. Yet another reason I love them.
TXT has never shied from bending gender-centered rules — please reference the aforementioned Yeonjun in cropped Balenciaga sweater. In the “WORLD” version of their “The Chaos Chapter: FREEZE” album, each member was depicted with heavy eyeshadow and very delicate, white royal costumes with crowns. Quite far from contemporary perceptions of stereotypical western “manliness” — which then again, is an extremely subjective term. 
In terms of their upcoming release, the “Daydream,” “Nightmare” and “Lullaby” versions especially caught my eye -— the “Farewell” version seems great, too, but it didn’t come off as strongly as the others in terms of conceptualization. Each set of photos was extremely delicate. 
In “Daydream” we see the members in a forest, and there is a curious sense of mythicality and magic that is innately tangible. Glitter dances across their cheeks and noses and ethereal sunlight glimmers from their faces. A bare-backed Yeonjun faces away from the camera in one picture, his small frame sitting perfectly among the shrubbery. A bare-chested Soobin stares directly at the camera in another, his bleach-blond hair and teal eyes — colored contacts and hair dye — adding more nuance to his already elegant baby pink shawl and over-the-top floral gemmed necklace. It’s rare for idols to show this much skin — it’s much more taboo in Eastern cultures — but TXT has never been one to shy away from “taboo” in the name of artistry. 
The “Nightmare” version is adequately named. The photos for this version are set in an extremely over-the-top bedroom with strings of wigs -— yes, wigs — and stuffed animals chaotically draping from one end of the dimly-lit chamber to the other. The members are each clothed in soft, white, pajama-like wool garments that are adorned with pastel pink lace and frills. Everyone is also adorned with their own pair of fuzzy white socks. Soft pink eyeshadows bring the aesthetic together. It’s stunning to witness to say the least.
The final version that I’ll discuss, “Lullaby,” can be well summarized by one phrase: androgynous Peter Pan. There is, within the photo set, one picture of each member where they are all in the same position, staring longingly out a large window at the night sky as they sit on the sill. Huening Kai is wearing a sheer glittery yellow long sleeve shirt topped with an almost comically large single shooting-star earring and a large silver chrome lotus ring. His skin glows, and the muted makeup doesn’t take away from his immense accessories. Both Beomgyu and Taehyun wear skin-tight pale yellow turtlenecks, each decorated with dainty pearls and crystals. Beomgyu flaunts a large yellow chrome lotus ring and single large pink chrome lotus earring. With this accented jewelry, there is no question that the boys welcome fluidity in expression. Well, either them or their stylists. 
In the end, all of this description and analysis culminates into one general realization that I push everyone to further examine. One, that TXT is the best K-pop group at the moment. And two, that their ability to not only produce incredible music but to also pair that with mind-bendingly beautiful and tasteful conceptualizations is a feat worth great recognition.

Every January, hundreds of skilled gamers gather to put on one of the most beloved events of the year. It’s a time of bus stop analogies, playground rumors coming to life and games being completed as fast as possible while raising millions of dollars for cancer research. This past Sunday marked the end of Awesome Games Done Quick 2023, the winter edition of the semiannual “Games Done Quick” speedrunning marathon. This year’s event brought a race through a once-lost Zelda game, a fast-footed showcase of the “Dance Dance Revolution”-inspired “StepMania” and the first Mario world record at a GDQ event in over a decade.
Games Done Quick was started in January of 2010 by then-Speed Demos Archive administrator Mike Uyama during the gaming convention MAGFest in Maryland. Originally intended for the show floor, internet issues forced Uyama and over 20 runners into his mother’s basement for two days of non-stop action. The event raised over $10,000 for the charity CARE, a humanitarian organization focused on combating poverty and world hunger, and from there it only expanded.
Instead of two days in a basement, GDQ events now take up entire hotels over the course of a week, with exceptions for the pandemic and AGDQ 2023 — which was scheduled for Florida but moved online due to the “Don’t Say Gay” law and restrictions on coronavirus requirements. Instead of around 20 runners, this past event saw over 150 gamers take part. 
However, the most notable expansion comes from the growth in donations. Last week, AGDQ 2023 raised $2,642,493 for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Over the past 13 years, the grand total raised for charity has accumulated to over $41 million.
“I think the coolest thing about GDQ is it’s one of the ways that speedrunning gets out there to the masses, and I’m grateful the way it gets out there is this cool charity event,” said Kosmic, a full-time speedrunner and YouTube creator with over 165,000 subscribers. “So common are these comments like, ‘Wow, you guys are just wasting your life…why aren’t you guys curing cancer instead of spending all this time on video games?’ and it’s like, dude, this could not be more ironic. We literally raise millions for [fighting] cancer.”
Throughout his time speedrunning, Kosmic has set 40 world records in games like “Super Mario Bros.” and “Donkey Kong 64.” Some of these records were earned by mere milliseconds. In “Super Mario Bros.,” it took years to optimize a single level, “4-2.” Kosmic believes the skill on display is what gives speedrunning its mass appeal.
“Video games are just popular in general, and so the same way that people who enjoy playing sports enjoy watching them at a high level,” Kosmic said. “It’s the same thing.”
One of the highlights of AGDQ 2023 was Tuesday’s “Super Mario Galaxy 2” Any% race, where runners competed to beat the game as fast as possible by any means necessary. Nothing was off the table, including glitches and two-player mode. After two hours, 54 minutes and 51 seconds, speedrunner Jhay got the category’s world record, a rare sight during GDQ. The prior record had been standing for nine months and was beaten by less than a minute. 
Jhay had spent the prior week practicing live on Twitch, with streams lasting nearly 12 hours and multiple runs hitting world record pace. Even still, at the start of the race, Jhay could not ignore the fact he was playing in front of 80,000 viewers.
“I was so nervous,” Jhay said. “You could probably see it in the first couple of levels… my cursor in the game was shaking a lot.” He got more comfortable throughout the run, and upon the magical moment of touching that final star, he entered a completely different state of being. 
“I don’t think I’ve ever celebrated as hard in my life,” he said. “Even in the video, at the end you can see me popping off like crazy…I was speechless”. 
The other runners also did incredible with times ranking within the top 15 all-time. For Jhay, this event was more than just about a world record for him, but an opportunity to showcase a game he loves with members of a community he loves. “Just being able to show off what I do in my game, and the Galaxy community itself was such a good experience”.
Another community that got attention this year was “Mega Man,” with a “Mega Man ZX” run on Thursday and two others on Saturday. Max, known online as OneOneTwo, is a casual speedrunner, Twitch streamer and administrator on the r/MegaMan subreddit and Discord server. 
“It’s just wonderful to see these games represented more … I feel like people, especially ‘Mega Man’ fans, sort of overestimate how popular the series is,” they said. ”Seeing people not only play [“Mega Man ZX”] more, but show why the game is so unique … it was really cool.”
One of Max’s favorite parts of GDQ is the accessibility livestream commentators bring to speedrunning during runs. 
“I think the thing GDQ does best is explaining how tricks work,” they said. “One thing I’ve noticed is that when people try to get into speedrunning games, they often don’t know where to start because they don’t understand how the mechanics and the tricks work.” 
Whether you choose to learn the mechanics or otherwise, Kosmic, Jhay and Max had the same advice for those looking to start speedrunning: just go for it.
“You’ve got nothing to lose,” Jhay said. “It might be rough at the beginning, but as long as you put in the time and you’ve got the motivation, you can do it. You can do anything. It doesn’t [take] a special person to be good at speedrunning, just someone with a lot of dedication.”

Senior guard Boogie Ellis led the Trojans to a 71-56 win over Utah Saturday night. Ellis led the team in scoring with 17 points alongside 3 assists and 2 steals.
The Trojans, fresh off a win over Colorado, looked to extend their homecourt winning streak to nine while the Utes attempted to end a two-game losing streak against UCLA and Oregon.
Despite the rare heavy rain in L.A., the stadium’s energy was high. The fans wearing red and gold were not shy to cheer on their fellow Trojans.
Sporting red and black, the Utes displayed impressive ball movement right off the bat. Junior forward Ben Carlson’s early offensive rebounding effort led to a shooting foul on the Trojans. Fifth-year guard Marco Anthony then hit both free throws to open up the scoring column.
Utah’s star player, senior center Branden Carlson, spent much of the game escaping double teams. Even with strong USC defensive emphasis, the Utes’ offense still found success when running through him. Carlson scored 17 points behind 77.8% accuracy in the first half.
After a slow start, rebounding for the Trojans improved as the first period progressed. Sophomore guard Malik Thomas fetched USC’s first offensive board 10 minutes into the game. Thomas’ hustle play ignited the team’s rebounding efforts as the Trojans obtained 12 out of 16 first-half rebounds in the game’s final 10 minutes.
Freshman guard Tre White stepped up as Utah’s defense focused its efforts on Ellis and fifth-year guard Drew Peterson. White led the team in scoring by the end of the first half with 11 points, shooting 5-for-6 from the field. White also pulled down two offensive rebounds.
The second half was much smoother for USC. After attempting zero shots in the first half, sophomore guard Kobe Johnson scored all of his 9 points in the second. Additionally, the team actively shut down Branden Carlson, withholding him to just 4 points, in contrast to 17 points in the first. 
“Well, he had the first 4 points in the second half, he didn’t score the rest of the game …. If he got the ball in the post on our guard we double-teamed him right away,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield on what led to the improved defense. “Our rotations were right there, we were engaged. It’s hard to guard him because he’s a pick-and-pop five, he’s so skilled, he’s an all-league player, he’s really good.”
Apart from defending the paint, the Trojans showcased incredible resilience in perimeter defense, cutting Utah’s 3-point percentage from 42.9% to a dreadful 18.2% in the second half. The Trojans in white successfully shut down junior guard Gabe Madsen, the Utes’ best 3-point shooter from deep, keeping him to just 2-for-10 from behind the arc.
Trojan momentum truly sparked after White’s steal on the defensive end, leading to a 3-on-1 fastbreak opportunity. White then caught a mesmerizing alley-oop from Peterson at the other end of the court as fans got on their feet. This play stunned the Utes’, last line of morale with nine minutes left. Compared to the calm Trojans, the Utes were rushing plays to hope for a miracle. Playing under pressure resulted in poor Utes offense as they gave up 4 turnovers out of a game total of 10 in the last nine minutes.
“It was even crazier with the atmosphere whenever we have the gym packed like this, these are the best games,” said White in a postgame interview. “I live for these games.”
USC spread the ball around, with four players scoring double digits. The Trojans also recorded 18 total assists from nine players. 
“We’ve really been playing well together,” said Ellis who contributed 9 assists in his last two games. “Getting a lot of threes up, driving and kicking, I feel like when we’re doing that, we’re at our best.”
 “We had a team effort tonight on both sides of the ball,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “That’s important for us to play smart offensive basketball, we really improved offensively especially in the last couple weeks … very proud of our effort, and how unselfish they’d become on offense.”
One key contributing factor to USC’s success was their second-half defense. The Trojans held the Utes to 25% shooting in the second half compared to 44.8% in the first. 
USC will face the University of Arizona next at McKale Center in Tucson Thursday at 6 p.m.

It’s a motion I’ve done hundreds of times before. Lunging forward onto the snow-swept platform, I wait for the familiar nudge of the chair and ascend into the mountains.
I fell in love with skiing when I was only 3 years old. No front teeth, Mount Bachelor, just good times. Every year since then, I’ve chased one thing: pow. From Beaver Creek to Whistler Blackcomb, if I was on skis, nothing else mattered.
This wasn’t always the case, though. Winter sports, such as skiing, and later snowboarding, have a history of being “as white as snow.” According to Ashley Rivas-Triana, a writer for the Emory University “History of Skiing and Snowsports” project, skiing was first introduced in the United States in the 19th century by Scandinavian immigrants. It was quickly popularized among Western mountain town residents, who used it as a form of efficient transportation. However, it also evolved to become a symbol of exclusive, elite white wealth. 
American ski culture, Annie Gilbert Coleman notes in “The Unbearable Whiteness of Skiing,” “eventually lumped all Europeans and Scandinavians together under a lily-white ‘European’ image,” synonymizing whiteness with wealth, luxury, and exclusivity. In other words, ski culture, rather than emphasizing pow and the outdoors, adopted an image that revolved around ethnicity and class.
Despite decades of shredding, diversifying skiing is still a process today. According to the National Ski Areas Association annual demographic study, 5.7% of skiers in the 2021-22 season identified as Asian or Pacific Islander while 88.7% identified as white. The percentage of white skiers is actually an increase from the previous season, when 87.6% of skiers were white, with similarly slight decreases in non-white visits. In fact, “none of the percentages have significantly changed in the past 10 seasons,” the study read. 
Growing up, I looked up to skiers like Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin. Of course they’re amazing athletes, but at the time, it didn’t seem like I had any other options. 
There wasn’t really anyone that looked like me who I could look up to.
Now, it’s a little different. Bit by bit, snow sports are becoming more diverse and inclusive. 
At age 14, Torrance native Chloe Kim won gold in SuperPipe at the 2015 X Games, becoming the youngest to do so in X Games history. She clinched gold again the following year, became the first female snowboarder to stomp back-to-back 1080s in the US Snowboarding Grand Prix and garnered a total of six SuperPipe Winter X titles. At the 2016 Lillehammer Winter Youth Olympic Games, Kim won gold in halfpipe and slopestyle.
Eileen Gu, a 19-year-old San Francisco native, won gold in freestyle halfpipe and big air at the recent 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. 
At the 2022 World Junior Alpine Ski Championships, Colorado native Ava Sunshine Jemison clinched a silver in Super-G and the 2022 Nor-Am overall title. 
In early 2022, then 16-year-old Japanese snowboarder Hiroto Ogiwara stomped the first ever backside Quint Coke 2160 (six full rotations) in history at The Nines in Switzerland. Spinning a horizontal hexagon and vertical quintuple, this was the trick that put the Red Bull athlete on the map. 
While it seems like there is an abundance of young talent, vying for a spot at the table as an Asian athlete is still an uphill battle — especially if you’re a woman. 
Sung Yeon Choimorrow, the executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, put it best. 
“I’m really wrestling with this idea that we’re all ‘American’ only when it comes to us being excellent and winning medals for the country.”
The daughter of first-generation Korean immigrants, Kim became the youngest halfpipe gold medalist at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. The following year, Kim defended her previous win as “the first woman to ever win multiple gold medals in the women’s event” since its introduction in 1998. Kim is the first athlete in history to clinch four major snowboarding titles in the Olympics, Worlds, Youth Olympics and X Games.
Yet, upon making the 2018 Olympic team, as an athlete and Asian American, Kim struggled with her identity. 
“People started asking me about my identity and my story growing up as a Korean American,” Kim said in an interview with ESPN. “By that point, racism towards Asians had become so normalized, people would say racist things to me as jokes and I would just laugh because I didn’t want to deal with the confrontation and say, ‘That really bothered me.’” 
Today, Kim is proud to be Korean American and stresses the need for having difficult conversations, especially those that involve racism.
“I hope that maybe one day, a little girl can hear my story and be inspired to keep going, to never give up, to learn that it’s OK to have a bad day, but you can move on if you come out in a better place at the end of it all,” Kim said.
The mountains may be the same, but slowly, things are changing.
It’s a bluebird day. Peering at the slope below, I slip on my goggles and push off on one ski. Gliding along the snow’s surface, as I gain speed, I lean into the mountain. I settle into a familiar, effortless pattern, leaving snake tracks in my wake.
I do this again and again, run after run, year after year.
I am carving out my own path.
You should too.

You may have heard in the headlines last week that former Trojan and two-time consensus All-American Reggie Bush was named to the 2023 College Football Hall of Fame Class, becoming the 35th Trojan to receive the honor.
While this should be a time for rejoicing and celebrating Bush’s storied career, one can not help but recall his infamous vacated Heisman. What a shame it is that in the lead of this story, Bush officially can’t be described as a Heisman Trophy winner because of the fact his win was taken away. Bush forfeited his trophy in 2010 before the NCAA and the Heisman Trophy Trust could officially take the award away from him.
Now, nearly 13 years since the award was stripped away and 18 years after he initially won the honor, it’s long overdue to give Bush back the trophy he rightfully deserved and wrongfully had revoked.
If you weren’t aware, Bush’s Heisman induction was nullified because the NCAA and the Pac-12 were investigating him and his family for possible rules Bush may have broken. According to the NCAA’s rules at the time, a player was not allowed to receive gifts of any kind from the school or anyone else and a player was not allowed to sign with an agent. There are many misconceptions that USC was involved in giving out these gifts, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.
What happened was that an agent, Lloyd Lake, was attempting to court Bush’s family to sign with him as an agent for when Bush went to the NFL. The sports agent provided Bush’s stepfather with a house and what is reported as close to $300,000 in benefits. All of this information became public when Bush decided to sign with another agent.
The rules have changed drastically since then, and now it’s commonplace in college football for athletes to receive large amounts of money, currently riding at an average of $3,400 a month. With name, image and likeness, athletes can now do what many other athletes before them were punished for doing. 
Now obviously, Bush and his family still broke the rules that were in place at the time, no matter how inept they were. Bush’s stepfather seemed to be reaping most of the benefits from the deal with the potential agent. It’s hard to imagine that Bush wasn’t reaping at least some of the benefits, but it’s clear he did not orchestrate the whole thing.
Years later, Bush is calling for his Heisman to be returned, as are many others. When you read about Bush’s recounting of the investigation and how it happened, it seemed the NCAA had already made up its mind about taking away his Heisman. Bush says the NCAA “didn’t do their homework” in the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the gifts to his stepfather.
Whether or not the NCAA did a proper investigation is subjective, depending on whose side you take, but it shouldn’t matter either way. The Heisman Trophy is given to the player who was the most outstanding player in all of college football for a given season. And that’s exactly what Bush was in 2005, and that was reflected in the votes when he received 88% of first-place votes.
The award has never been about what the player is like or does off the field. When balloters vote for the Heisman, they account for what they did on the field. Bush had one of the greatest college football seasons of all time. He shouldn’t have the greatest college football award stripped away because of his stepfather’s misdealings with a potential agent.
Bush will now forever be enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame as one of the sport’s greatest players. One organization recognized his greatness in college aside from the off-the-field stuff, and the NCAA should follow suit. The things the NCAA punished Bush for are no longer against the rules, so they should take that into account and correct past wrongs.
The Heisman Trophy Trust, which is entirely separate from the NCAA, said they’d restore Bush’s Heisman but only if the NCAA restores his vacated records. Once again, putting all the power in the NCAA’s hands. Mind you, the NCAA is the same organization that pushed for their athletes to be labeled as “student-athletes” so that if a college athlete ever got injured and applied for workers’ compensation, they wouldn’t get it. So will the NCAA make the correct decision and give Bush back his Heisman in a move that would favor an athlete? Sadly, probably not. Most recently in 2021, a spokesperson for the NCAA said even with the NIL rules in place, his Heisman and records won’t be considered for reinstatement.
Bush’s dominance should be respected with one of sport’s greatest honors always next to his name. It should be “Reggie Bush, Heisman Trophy winner,” not “Reggie Bush, the man who won the Heisman in 2005 before it was taken away.”

What’s the longest you’ve had to wait for something you felt you deserved? Did you even get it when all was said and done, or did you get a pat on the back and a few extra words of encouragement? Imagine waiting 600 days and some change. That’s how long coal miners of the United Mine Workers of America in Alabama have been on strike, waiting for pay raises and better benefits. 
In the sea of labor and union-related news that has come to a crest in these last couple of years, this coal miners’ strike walks a narrow line. It predates many recent strikes, and yet has outlasted nearly all of them — perhaps because there isn’t as much public pressure on coal companies to strike a fair deal as there is with, say, a railroad or beverage company. 
Coal is a dying industry, and I put that pretty lightly. This doesn’t negate that in certain regions, coal jobs are the only ones available and paying. It also doesn’t negate that coal miners work one of the most dangerous jobs in America. 
If you’ve read my column long enough, you’ll know the UMWA strike has become somewhat of a motif. There’s something in me that maybe foolishly thinks that this strike can be our generation’s Blair Mountain, and another part that sees this struggle and the subsequent lack of attention that it has garnered as symptomatic of what I’d call a crisis of empathy for our Southern neighbors. Now, there’s a small part of me that thinks that resolving this strike can be President Joe Biden’s chance at redemption.
Why does Biden need redemption, you may ask? Compared to the last commander-in-chief, he hasn’t done anything outright heinous — though these may be words that’ll haunt me in a couple of years. My Democrat pals might be ready to get on my case about how he inherited a mess or can only do so much. But I, for one, think there was a serious lack of judgment when it came to his decision to end a looming rail strike back in December. 
Biden, in 2021, said labor would always be welcome in his administration and that he intended to be the “most pro-union president leading the most pro-union administration in American history.” Earlier on in his administration, he generally seemed to live up to that promise, but that wasn’t the case after he signed legislation to prematurely settle a rail strike, citing potentially disastrous consequences on the economy. In doing so, he crossed the picket line before it was even drawn in the dirt. And yet, I see a chance for the so-called “most pro-union president” to avoid a post-presidential lifetime of being called a scab, if only he’d finally stand up for his UMWA allies that helped get him to the White House.
The UMWA has been an unabashed supporter of the President and his policies, including his ambitious Build Back Better Framework plan. In a statement released in 2021, the UMWA vocalized its support for multiple aspects of the now-stalled bill, including provisions in the bill that would address Black Lung and investments in transitions to clean energy in coal fields. 
What has Biden done to thank the union for their support of one of his key campaign promises? Wined ‘em, dined ‘em and fined ‘em; his National Labor Relation Board fined the union $13.3 million for damages on the picket line, later reducing the amount to roughly $435,000 following pushback. 
Unions are critical to Democrats’ success at the polls. If Biden and the Democrats keep treating unions this way, though, they’re going to lose them. No voting bloc’s support should be taken advantage of, and support is absolutely subject to change. We saw that in 2016, when working-class voters showed up for former President Donald Trump. 
Biden and the Democratic Party owe it to these coal miners to step in and step up. The President has shown that he has the gall and power to settle large labor disputes before, and he has the chance to do so now. This time, it should be in favor of the workers who are on strike. Biden probably won’t because a prolonged strike in the coal industry won’t have much of an effect on the economy as a whole in comparison to the looming rail strike. 
There’s less of an incentive there. He probably won’t gain brownie points with economic hawks for settling the UMWA strike in favor of the miners, but he’ll gain something a lot more important: the renewed trust and support of Southern union members and a paving stone to help him and Democrats make inroads in the South, starting with Southern workers.

Querida Latinas, you have seen Teresa and Rubí on the big screen as their beauty attracts men both on and off the screen. You have also seen María Elena Velasco play “La India María,” one of the most popular characters in Mexico. However, while “La India María” portrays a humorous and entertaining representation of Indigenous groups in Latin America, it is widely inaccurate. Teresa and Rubí fall into the same boat as they present the image of a “white beauty” to a diverse audience. 
As young Latinas glance at the TV, they are met with white-passing women catching the eyes of men. Their light eyes and pale skin confuse young girls, making them believe that their nose, skin and hair are not as beautiful as the actresses on screen who don’t share their features. But Afro/Indigenous features are beautiful, and Eurocentric features are not synonymous with beauty. 
In October 2022, TikTok was filled with the damaging trend of the “copy and paste Latina.” Creators took to TikTok to attempt the trend by posting makeup tutorials on how to recreate the “look.” The tutorial demonstrates how to contour your nose into a “perfect” button shape and how to achieve silky-straight hair. But a button nose and straight hair do not define beauty. 
Audiences said they felt like the trend was just another racist commentary on how “all Latinas look alike” and were stereotyping them into a “basic” category — something that is far from the case as Latin America is beyond diverse, with Black and Indigenous beauty shining from Mexico to Chile. 
Contrary to the title of the trend, copying and pasting a makeup and hair tutorial on TikTok is not beauty. The definition of beauty is not a trend and the only thing making it one does is evoke questions and feelings of insecurities for young girls. 
Latin America is filled with 33 countries with diverse populations — none of which the media and the “copy and paste Latina” trend highlight. No woman should hide their nose, straighten their hair or try and lighten their skin tone to meet an unachievable standard. Your real beauty is already there, and it took years to evolve.
As trends like these appear on the explore page, it is essential to remind Latinas that no feature is a requirement for beauty. Trends are meant to be filled with joy and excitement to inspire viewers to participate in them. However, this trend was the exact opposite, as it put down women who do not have the features and called those who do “basic.”  
Beauty standards are rooted in Eurocentric features, which makes women of color question their beauty and analyze their features in the mirror when their beauty is already present. 
You already carry beauty and people must refrain from categorizing groups and placing them as standards to follow. Young girls should not be straightening their curls and placing tape on their noses to diminish its bump just to fit into a standard set by colonization. 
Beauty does not remain in one race. Beauty consists of every feature, every skin color, every hair type and everyone. Makeup tutorials should teach young girls how to embrace what they already have and not conform to an idealistic version of themselves, so stand out and flaunt your natural features.

Drifting through the clairvoyance of melody, the only shadow of reality left stretching over me are the dollar-store AirPods knockoffs in my ears. Transported to a familiar dimension through euphony, I float through the hypnotic haze cushioned by my carefully crafted playlist. Nothing else matters in this state, nothing can hurt me; the only thing of significance to me at this moment is what song will come next on shuffle. This is the power of comfort music.
Everyone has a comfort song or artist. Maybe you uncovered a hidden gem while listening to your “Discover Weekly” playlist on Spotify and you’ve relentlessly listened ever since. Maybe your comfort song stems from your childhood when your mother would blast Alice In Chains and Modest Mouse while speeding to drop you off at grammar school (Just me? Oh, okay). Whatever music you may take solace in, every person retains a selection of tunes that calm their nerves and ease their mind like no other: an easy escape route from negative thoughts of anxiety and stress. Here are a few of my comfort artists who never fail to replace my negativity with melody.
TOLEDO
I still remember the exact crisp autumn day on which my friend showed me this band in my sophomore year of high school. Lounging in the front seat of my little, red mom car, she queued TOLEDO’s “Some Samurai,” forever changing the trajectory of my music taste. The dreamy melody and melancholy lyrics reverberated through the vehicle, swaddling me in their warm, mellow embrace. 
The duo behind TOLEDO, Daniel Álvarez de Toledo and Jordan Dunn-Pilz, are a New York City-based dream-pop powerhouse, skillfully crafting new masterpieces every year. The pair rely on each other creatively, fostering a childhood friendship while sharing their musical talent with the world.  
TOLEDO’s most recent album, “How It Ends,” features numerous nostalgic tracks to bring you back to the good old days such as “Boxcutter” and “Soda Can.” “L-Train” and “Flake” cushion the listener with soft vocals and homey guitar, sure to wash away your sorrow and worries from the first riff. TOLEDO is one of my go-to comfort artists when I’m feeling less than perfect, and they certainly deserve a listen. 
dad sports
I’ve never been able to find any other music quite like that of dad sports. Ever since one of my best friends sent me a text practically demanding that I check them out, I’ve been indisputably hooked. dad sports graces every single playlist I create and, at this point, has become a key part of my identity as a melophile. 
dad sports is headed by Miguel Plante, a brilliant mind producing and performing tunes imbued with hues of yellow and orange, bottling a mid-summer sunset with his harmonies. “out 4 a breather” is nothing short of a modern bedroom-pop masterpiece, flawlessly encapsulating the feeling of speeding home with your windows down after a long day in high school. The whole track exudes the vibe of classic gingham linens from your grandma’s house, infusing the soft indie pop guitar with retro nostalgia. “name & place” continues with the trio’s musical signature, blanketing the listener with magnificent ‘70s synth-reminiscent melodies, diving headfirst into a pool of fond memory. dad sports’ music has never failed to remind me of both better times and the positive things to come, making them one of my favorite groups to turn to for comfort. 
Pearly Drops
Sometimes it’s easiest to just close my eyes and allow myself to sink into the heavenly vocals of Pearly Drops. A recent discovery of mine, Pearly Drops’ music is a level of ethereal that’s difficult to vocalize. With my headphones at full volume and their music blasting into my ears, everything falls away and I feel as though I could wander across the inkiness of the Milky Way and waltz with the stars. 
Hailing from Helsinki, Finland, Pearly Drops features the talent of Sandra Tervonen and Juuso Malin. Together, the musical duo composes an atmospheric musical experience akin to the work of Grimes, Pastel Ghost and Crystal Castles. Their track “Final Form” amalgamates aspects of both modern hyperpop and rock, resulting in a chorus sure to knock the wind out of you. “Call For Help” dials it back, far more in touch with the pair’s celestial sound. 
However, if you’re going to listen to any Pearly Drops track, my top recommendation is “Bloom For Me.” “Bloom for Me” is angelic, an absolute triumph of the ethereal wave. The track gleams like a city skyline in the middle of the night, emanating the same haunting placidity as the witching hour.
Despite the stark differences between Pearly Drops and the other groups on this list, they too harbor an incredible amount of comfort for me: the group even states on their Spotify profile that their music is made to “keep the hope inside and the unmeaningful at bay.” If that doesn’t sound like comfort music to you, I don’t know what will.
Music is a crucial facet of my life; it’s been part of my identity from a young age. So it’s only natural that I, like many others, would also find innate solace in it. Next time you’re feeling stressed or dejected, try listening to one of these artists, or one of your own favorite artists. I promise you’ll feel comforted almost instantly.
