Though USC’s special teams players might not get much regular attention on the football field, they can often be the deciding factor in big games.
Pressure point · Senior placekicker Andre Heidari, who went 15-22 last year, will need to convert when the game is on the line this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The 2014 Trojan special teams corps will look to build upon a season that saw flashes of brilliance as well as some frustration.
Senior placekicker Andre Heidari exemplified this trend last year. The Bakersfield, California native went 15-22 on the season, good for 68.2 percent. He struggled especially from long range, only making three of eight attempts between 40 and 49 yards.
Against Washington State on Sept. 7 of last year, Heidari missed one field goal and had another blocked, leading to a 10-7 loss that began the Trojans’ tumultuous season.
Heidari also missed two field goals against Notre Dame on Oct. 19, prompting interim head coach Ed Orgeron to declare an open competition for the starting kicker job.
But Heidari played the hero later in the season when he nailed a 47-yarder with 19 seconds to go against No. 5 Stanford to upset the Cardinal, 20-17 on Nov. 16. Heidari must be more consistent in close games for the Trojans to have the success they seek this year.
Backing Heidari up are redshirt sophomore Alex Wood, freshman Wyatt Schmidt and sophomore Matt Boermeester.
Redshirt junior punter Kris Albarado averaged 37.1 yards per punt last season, with just four touchbacks in 79 punts. He earned Pac-12 honorable mention honors thanks to his tendency to pin opponents within their own 20-yard line.
Heidari is listed as Albarado’s backup at the punter position, followed by freshman Reid Budrovich, redshirt freshman Jack Basalari and redshirt junior Joey Krassenstein.
This group of punters is multitalented, as Budrovich will also play baseball at USC and Krassenstein got his start playing on the club rugby team.
On the other side of the ball, junior wideout Nelson Agholor will serve as the Trojans’ first-string punt returner for the second consecutive year. Last year, the Tampa, Florida native averaged 19.1 yards per punt return and scored two touchdowns, including a 93-yard scamper in USC’s lopsided 62-28 win over California. He also averaged 17.1 yards per kick return.
The kickoff returner position is more open for the Trojans this year.
Agholor and former standout wide receiver Marqise Lee split responsibilities at the kickoff returner position last year, and then-sophomore cornerback Kevon Seymour took some reps there as well.
This year, head coach Steve Sarkisian appears poised to use a group of younger players to return kickoffs.
Freshman wideout/cornerback Adoree’ Jackson (Serra Gardena) and freshman wide receiver/safety JuJu Smith (Long Beach Poly) and are slated to take the majority of kick returns.
Jackson played wide receiver, running back, defensive back and return specialist in high school and returned a punt and a kick for touchdowns in the 2013 CIF Western Division Final.
Smith was sidelined for part of his 2013 season with injuries but has demonstrated impressive abilities as a returner in the past as well.
Smith might bloom under the watch of first-year special teams coordinator Johnny Nansen, who happens to be his cousin. Nansen served under Sarkisian at Washington for the last five years and will also coach the running backs (some of whom are also listed as kickoff returners).
One such player is sophomore running back Justin Davis. Davis burst onto the scene last year, racking up 361 yards and six touchdowns before suffering a season-ending ankle injury that required surgery.
From Davis to Heidari, USC’s entire special teams unit must strive for consistency in order to come out on top of close matchups.

It seemed too good to be true — now we find out it might literally be too good to be true.
I didn’t think too much of the story when I first came across it on the Spirit of Troy Facebook page, where a link to the article on USC’s athletic website had been posted. It seemed fitting that the marching band’s page would be the first to alert me of the story — the ever-so-aptly-named Spirit of Troy epitomizes Trojan pride even more than the Coliseum student section or even the football team itself, so it wasn’t a big surprise that the band was the first to recognize the essence of what we hope any USC student-athlete is.
I then saw the article again at the top of ESPN’s website and thought maybe the media was making a bigger deal out of this than it should. I’m a huge ESPN fan and really respect how the network revolutionized the sports media industry, but the company certainly doesn’t mind milking the feel-good stories as much as it can, and I wasn’t sure if this qualified as national news.
It sure does now.
I certainly wasn’t skeptical about the story before speculation that it might be a cover-up. It’s obviously unusual to hear a person jump from the second story of an apartment building to rescue a child drowning in a pool, but not unheard of. It’s not like saying Shaw developed Jedi powers and lifted his young nephew out of the water using The Force.
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reported that 137 kids under 15 years of age died from drowning during the summer season of 2012, so it’s not an uncommon occurrence around this time of year. My grandpa actually sacrificed a wristwatch once to rescue an ambitious 4-year-old me back before I had a conceptual grasp on the idea of “the deep end” of pools.
But in hindsight, this water rescue story doesn’t exactly hold water. I wondered why Shaw didn’t dive straight into the pool or climb down any stairs instead of jumping onto concrete, but I don’t know enough about his apartment layout or his level of adrenaline to make a judgment. The incident occurred in Palmdale, around an hour-and-a-half drive from campus, and with the season so close I would expect players to be living on campus full-time. On the other hand, the incident did occur this past Saturday and the team doesn’t practice on weekends. The next big question was why no one called an ambulance for Shaw’s nephew, but maybe Shaw acted before any physical damage was done to the 7-year-old — I didn’t need CPR after my drowning scare, just a towel.
The story got fishier when the alleged “other side of the story” came into discussion. After initially expressing no doubt over Shaw’s claim, coach Steve Sarkisian told the media after practice Tuesday that the school was investigating the legitimacy of the story due to phone calls the school had received questioning the legitimacy of the story.
Nicole Auerbach, Josh Peter and Tess Quinlan of USA Today reported that a woman who identified herself as Shaw’s sister, Asia Shaw, defended her brother’s original version story.  Though some are reporting that she was not present at the family event during which the action allegedly took place, she confirmed that her 7-year-old son, Shaw’s nephew, can not swim and that Josh Shaw allegedly reacted to the incident because the family member who was supposed to be watching the boy had looked away. She referred to reports that Josh Shaw had actually been involved in a burglary as “speculation.”
The deputy of the sheriff station in Palmdale said that no call was made about Shaw on Saturday. The Los Angeles Police Department was asked about Shaw and is investigating the incident but didn’t produce any new information in their comment.
At this point, very little is clear, but there is plenty of speculation and we likely will have a better answer soon. For now, it certainly dents the focus of a team preparing for a new season that starts in less than a week.
Regardless of the cause, the ankle injury could have a big impact on USC’s secondary as Shaw started all 14 games last season at either safety or cornerback. Beyond his performance on the field, the true impact may be the questioning of the integrity of a senior leader. Not only has Sarkisian lauded his character in any question from the media, but he was named one of the captains of the team for the upcoming season.
Though there will likely be consequences if a crime occurred, Sarkisian is clearly giving Shaw the benefit of the doubt for the time being, and it’s something we all need to do too. This shouldn’t be entirely out of blind loyalty for a member of the Trojan family; it’s a constitutional right of any citizen in this country.
There’s a chance Shaw is a criminal, and there’s a chance he is a hero. There’s a chance he’s both, and there’s a chance he’s neither. It’s not worth guessing exactly where on that spectrum he falls because we don’t know what circumstances led to the incident.
It’s not our job to judge. It’s our job to stand and cheer when he comes out onto the field this Saturday with the rest of his teammates, even if he comes out on crutches.

The USC defense enters the 2014 season in the middle of a massive transition. Nowhere is this change more evident than in the linebacking corps, as the group adjusts to new defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox’s 3-4 defensive front. This change in basic formation marks a shift from previous coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s 5-2 hybrid scheme that flummoxed opposing offenses and had the Trojans as the best statistical defense in the Pac-12.
Strong and steady · Linebacker Hayes Pullard returned for his senior year and was elected a co-captain for the second straight year. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Early on, the Trojans will have to compensate for the loss of hybrid end/outside linebacker Devon Kennard who was a stalwart for the Trojans last year. Kennard was selected in the fifth round of the 2014 NFL Draft by the New York Giants.
Senior J.R. Tavai and redshirt sophomore Scott Felix (formerly Scott Starr) will look to fill the void left by former co-captain Kennard.
Tavai was a revelation midway through the season as he finished the year starting seven consecutive games. Overall, Tavai recorded 56 tackles on the year and was so impressive in conference play that he earned an All-Pac-12 honorable mention. While he has struggled with injuries during his time at USC, Tavai has demonstrated the ability in games and recent practices to make a major impact on the gridiron this season.
Felix fought his way into a starting spot after only appearing in six games last season and recording nine tackles. Felix has been plagued by injuries during his time at USC, missing most of the 2012 season with a neck injury, from which he didn’t fully recover until the second game of 2013.
After Tavai and Felix, however, the Trojans lack seasoned veterans to play on the outside at linebacker. Jabari Ruffin, a local product from Downey, was slated to compete for time at the outside spot, but the redshirt sophomore was lost for the season after suffering a knee injury in fall camp.
This means that the group of true freshman linebackers from coach Steve Sarkisian’s inaugural recruiting class will be thrust into action very quickly. In Sarkisian’s inaugural depth chart, Don Hill, Malik Dorton and Uchenna Nwosu might all see time this year based on how the season progresses. Nwosu is a hybrid back who has the ability to play inside and outside. He was a standout at Los Angeles powerhouse Narbonne High and the Trojans would benefit greatly if he doesn’t skip a beat in his transition to the collegiate level.
Dorton played at St. John Bosco (Bellflower, Califonia) where he was a highly regarded defensive end. Hill enrolled in the spring, but was held out of practice while recovering from an Achilles injury.
The inside linebackers appear to be a bit more settled as the Trojans have depth and experience at the position.
Linebacker Hayes Pullard is a fifth-year senior who has been one of the most dependable Trojans over the last few years. He has led the team in tackles for two of the last three seasons, while starting almost every game. The Inglewood, California native will serve as a co-captain for the second straight season.
Junior defensive end Leonard Williams sang the praises of Pullard at Pac-12 Football Media Day this summer.
“Having Hayes come back was a big part of our defense being strong this year,” Williams said. “He’s a great leader … He’s always been a great leader, since I was a freshman.”
Pullard will anchor the defense with the support of senior inside linebacker Lamar Dawson, who is coming off a knee injury, as well as redshirt junior utility linebacker Anthony Sarao, a dependable contributor to both defense and special teams during his career as a Trojan.
Sarao earned the starting nod at the weak inside linebacker position heading into 2014 after a strong 2013 season. Last year he recorded 44 total tackles after Sarao worked his way into a starting role in the last seven games of the season.
Though the Trojans might be young and relatively thin at linebacker, new coach Peter Sirmon certainly has an abundance of talent to work with. Sirmon doubles as the recruiting coordinator brings experience as both a player and a coach. He has previously coached at Tennessee and Washington and also served as a graduate assistant at Oregon.
Sirmon faced off against the Trojans when lettered at Oregon for four years under coach Mike Bellotti in the late 1990s. His direct experience as both a player and coach in the Pac-12 could potentially serve him well as he gears his linebackers up to combat the wide array of offenses the Trojans will face in the upcoming season.

As the countdown to USC’s first football game continues, the Trojans participated in a full-pad practice on Tuesday morning.
Repeat feat · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler would be hard-pressed to top his last performance against Fresno State. In last year’s Las Vegas Bowl, he passed for a career-high 345 yards and four touchdowns. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian stressed the importance of focus as they prepare for the Trojans’ Saturday home opener against the Fresno State Bulldogs. The team’s ability to maintain focus is already being tested as allegations swirl regarding the events involving Josh Shaw on Saturday night.
First time for everything
Sarkisian was animated after practice and was noticeably excited about leading the Trojans on Saturday against Fresno State in his first game as USC’s head coach.
The Southern California native reminisced about watching the 1984 Olympic Games and many Raider games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, as well as his time there as an assistant at USC.
“I joked with the players the other day during the mock game,” Sarkisian said. “Cody [Kessler], Hayes [Pullard] and I were kind of out on the field earlier, throwing it around and I said, ‘I don’t know who’s gonna be more excited, you guys or me the first time we come down.’”
Know yourself, know your enemy
As game day creeps ever closer for the Trojans, Sarkisian seemed pleased with his team’s Tuesday morning practice.
“I thought they were focused, competitive,” Sarkisian said. “I though Cody was extremely sharp throwing the ball and I think we’re in a good place.”
Sarkisian also noted that he is trying to make his team focus more on itself and its own strengths and weaknesses than on its opponent’s game.
The Bulldogs’ strengths might be tough to pinpoint anyway since losing their star quarterback Derek Carr to the NFL. Carr led the nation in passing yards (5,083) and touchdowns (50) in 2013 and was selected in the second round of the NFL Draft by the Oakland Raiders.
Fresno State head coach Tim DeRuyter has yet to name a starting quarterback for Saturday’s game. Brian Burrell and Brandon Connette have been locked in competition since Connette transferred from Duke, and both are slated to appear in Saturday’s game.
“They’re both good athletes, they’re both good runners and can throw it,” Sarkisian said. “I’m sure we’ll have a couple wrinkles for each guy.”
Freshman phenom
Ajene Harris, a true freshman wide receiver out of Crenshaw High School, displayed more moxie than might have been expected at such a young age.
His dedication and work ethic landed him a starting spot as the team’s third starting wide receiver.
“The work that I put in paid off, but I’m not really settling on that,” Harris said. “I’m ready to work every day.”

The Emmys, supposedly the show to celebrate all the best in television, were held on a random Monday night in August this year. They were moved from their usual September date by the bigger and better ratings NBC can get with Sunday Night Football, and bullied off of their cushy football-less Sunday night slot by MTV’s Video Music Awards.
The Emmys are the relative runt of the major award shows litter, lagging far behind the Oscars, Grammys and even the non-EGOT Golden Globes in terms of ratings the last few years. It is curious that this is the case given that television is in the midst of an undeniable golden age, even surpassing film in the eyes of some in terms of the quality of its top offerings. Indeed, you would be hard-pressed to find recent feature films to challenge the sustained quality of Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones.

TV’s showcase event, however, fails to even come close to the success of the Oscars. The main reason for this is simple: The draw of these shows is first and foremost about watching stars mingle with one another. The awards themselves are largely a pretense. Yes, great creative work gets recognition on national TV through these programs, but no one really thinks that these awards are always given to the ones who truly did the best in the category. For example, during Monday’s awards, after Jim Parsons was given his fourth Emmy for lead actor in a comedy series against some very stiff competition, even the acclaimed actor seemed slightly puzzled that a different nominee wasn’t recognized. (“There’s no accounting for taste.”)
No, the awards themselves are not really why people tune in. It is for seeing the stars in glamorous dresses and sharp tuxedos looking shiny together. That is why the Oscars, despite complaints every year over snubs and undeserving winners, just hit a 10-year ratings high back in March. The stars were out en masse, and with the Ellen DeGeneres selfie heard ’round the world leading the charge — at least 3.3 million retweets, over four times more than the next most retweeted tweet ever — the Oscars satisfied its audience’s wish for star power like never before. The Emmys? Not so much. The glamour of a Jolie or a Clooney on the red carpet is one thing, Aaron Paul and Julianna Margulies are another. The rare McConaughey and Julia Roberts stick out like giraffes in a flock of sheep.
Host Seth Meyers sleepwalked through the three-hour program and proved prophetic with the line in his opening monologue about jokes being like the nominees because, “they can’t all be winners.” Several of his quips elicited nothing more than light applause.
Nevertheless, the Emmys provided some morsels of celebrity appeal. Bryan Cranston and Julia Louis-Dreyfus kissing and Jimmy Fallon stealing Stephen Colbert’s acceptance speech were two memorable ones. These moments, however, were few and far between. Between that and the allure of the Every Simpsons Ever Marathon still going strong on FX, it was very hard to not touch the remote when the show dragged. It would’ve been so much easier to go online after the show and simply read one of a number of recap articles offering a collection of clips of the most memorable moments.
It brings to mind the success of the latest incarnations of late-night TV. Late-night, which used to be solid as a rock when it came to ratings, finds itself fighting a losing battle on that front, instead competing for the most buzz-causing videos to drive Internet traffic. Jimmy Fallon is probably the most notorious for this, with his myriad videos of singing pop while in character or playing hilarious games with celebrities. Perhaps it is not much of a surprise that he was central to one of the most memorable moments of the night. Just as networks are realizing that many people lack the patience to sit through a full late-night show, the same phenomenon seems to be happening with awards shows, the Emmys in particular. It’s been a running gag that these shows are interminable, and maybe it is time to relegate even more awards to off-screen presentations. The Oscars run even longer than the Emmys, but they can rely on prestige. The Grammys have their performances to lean on. The Globes have lately cultivated an irreverent tone to contrast with the haughtier Oscars. The Emmys haven’t figured out their draw. They played like a flatter, duller version of the Oscars on Monday, and that simply won’t do.
Maybe it is a lot to ask the Emmys to find a unifying trait to lean their show on when television is so divergent now, with blockbuster-type epics next to traditional sitcoms next to uploaded-all-at-once political thrillers. Maybe it was a bad Sunday for TV in general; after all, the VMAs also suffered a similar ratings hit this year. It’s most likely, though, that the Emmys themselves have been victimized by the very explosion of quality that has propelled television so prominently upwards in the minds of so many.

Cinema students will often tell you that the odds are not in your favor in the industry. But USC prepares students as much as they can — and it does help that the USC School of Dramatic Arts is one of the top ranked programs in the nation. There really is no better place to go if a student’s ultimate dream is to win an Emmy or an Oscar.

One SDA student is striving to embody the ambitious and optimistic culture of USC. David Mandell, a senior theatre major, is taking on the ambitious task of creating his very own short film. As a soon-to-be graduate, he can add producer and writer of a short film on his ever-growing resume. David Mandell’s past activities at USC have included the Trojan Marching Band, Trojan Knights, multiple plays and Alternative Winter Break trips to India. He has also gained impressive professional experience in the film industry; naturally, his next pursuit would fall behind the scenes rather than in front of the camera.
“I came to USC as a theatre major knowing I would get involved in the film community because although I want to act, my innate desire for organizing projects has catapulted me into this opportunity,” Mandell said.
Laugh Along the Way is David Mandell’s first independent short film, impressive considering he is only 21. The film draws from Mandell’s own personal ideas and observations about life. Mandell aims to make the audience laugh and reflect on high school culture.
“Laugh Along the Way is a short film that revolves around John, a high school senior dealing with his recent diagnosis of leukemia,” Mandell said. “While in chemotherapy he befriends an 11-year-old kid named Sam who ends up being the younger brother of Chris, the only openly gay kid in the high school whom John once bullied.”
Laugh Along the Way is currently using the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo to raise funds to finance the movie. The film’s Indiegogo campaign allows anyone to donate — and with the proper amount, you could be named a “producer” on the film. Mandell already has actors cast, and an 80-page screenplay and his personal passion are fueling the film. He hopes to do a festival run and amass additional funds for a feature-length film. Mandell says his determination is fueled by an undying love for the industry.
“My interest in film and cinema is rooted in my childhood,” Mandell said. “None of my family is in the industry, nor do they have any ties with the arts, but they have an incredible appreciation for the arts.”
Mandell credits his intense work ethic to his passion for his subject matter.
“When you do what you love it doesn’t feel like work,” Mandell said. “I also saw an inspirational speaker say if you want to be successful, you have to want it more than you want to breathe, you have to want it more than sleep.”
In addition to actively breaking into the competitive industry, Mandell hopes to offer advice to undergraduate students. Mandell’s personable and charismatic character makes it hard to resist his wise words based on his experiences at USC.
“Your network is your net worth. Take advantage of everyone around you,” Mandell said. “USC itself has provided an opportunity to meet a plethora of talented individuals in all areas of the industry. Bringing them along to work on the project provides not only opportunities for all of us to grow, but it offers a professional showcase for many artists.”
Mandell has high aspirations for the years after he graduates from USC. After his last semester this fall, he plans to stay in Los Angeles.
“I have many dreams and goals for recent years, but the goal is to have this project take off and get involved in independent producing and have my acting career take off simultaneously,” Mandell said.

FYF Fest took place this weekend in Exposition Park and perhaps more than ever before, this year’s festival exemplified the increasing disparities of today’s ever-expanding musical landscape.
Growing pains · FYF Festival initially began as a much smaller scale event in Echo Park. The festival’s growing popularity enabled it to move to Exposition Park, but there were difficulties controlling the crowd. — Chandler Golan | Daily Trojan
Though the change of venue from the L.A. State Historic Park was convenient for USC students, it also illuminated the crossroads at which FYF stands: between its humble, DIY punk rock beginnings in Echo Park and the massive spectacle of larger commercial festivals more akin to revelries we are so used to seeing at the Coliseum. Whether it was indie versus mainstream, old versus new, analog versus digital or serious versus goofy, the festival — and many of the performers — straddled the line between dichotomous trends.
The biggest story of the first day actually had nothing to do with the music; the subject of everyone’s discussions (read: complaints) was the absurdly long line snaking all around the premises to get in the main entrance. Though some concertgoers were able to sneak in immediately with those at the front, others claimed to have waited up to three hours in the heat just to gain entrance. This prompted the FYF team to send out a message via Twitter and their FYF app saying that scans and searches were happening as quickly as possible, but the message hardly assuaged frustrations. On top of this, entrance to the indoor Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena stage was cut off due to a lack of space (though there was great deal of available seating which had been inexplicably roped off). These problems left a bad taste in attendees’ mouths and seemed to point to the fact that FYF — despite being managed by well-known promoter Goldenvoice — is not ready to be the behemoth that festivals like Coachella and HARD have become.
But once inside, fans were treated to an eclectic array of entertainment. New Zealand native Connan Mockasin started things out at The Trees stage with his unique brand of psychedelic 70’s-inspired R&B mixed with ambient drones and tribal chants. 18-year-old DJ/producer XXYYXX then put on an impressive display of sampled chopped and screwed hip-hop layered under backwards, slowed down vocals. Though one would expect an artist like XXYYXX to be a darling of FYF listeners, the crowd response was weak, prompting him to stop the music and take to the mic to ask, “Can we please act like we’re at a f-cking concert?!”
Norwegian D.J. Todd Terje, on the other hand, had no problem getting his crowd into the music. This might have been partially due to the fact that he played the Arena, which is FYF’s equivalent to Coachella’s Sahara tent in that it is the go-to destination for EDM ravers who want to dance. Still, artists like Terje, with his kitschy, self-aware blend of disco and electronic music, seem to align better with FYF’s aesthetic than the formulaic “build and drop” music of D.J.s like Skrillex or Avicii.
Punk rockers and metalheads alike flocked to the Trees stage the first night for Against Me! and Boris, two bands who are known to pack a sonic punch. While Against Me! proved that their 15-odd years together have lent them a degree of synchronicity, Boris appeared flustered and unrehearsed. They encountered sound problems right from the outset and never seemed to recover. The Presidents of the United States of America encountered similar technical difficulties. In contrast to Boris’ inability to break their dark, brooding personas and fix the sound before the next song, the Presidents stopped to made some jokes while the technicians did their thing before the band continued without a hitch.
For those less inclined toward head banging, Slowdive’s swelling shoegaze jams and Tycho’s mellowed out take on Aphex Twin-esque drum and bass music proved both relaxing and stimulating.
Without a doubt, though, the highlight of the first night was Grimes’ mesmerizing performance at The Lawn stage. Surrounded by smoke, her blue hair and baggy T-shirt billowed in the wind, adding an alien dimension to her already supernatural sound. The first few notes of the bassline of “Oblivion” — the best song of the decade thus far according to Pitchfork — sent the crowd into its loudest frenzy of the evening. Supported by two dancers, Grimes ran spontaneously around the stage, looking more comfortable than ever as performer. Her show was a testament to the fact that it is possible to perform with all of the style and grandeur of a Lady Gaga or Katy Perry while maintaining musical authenticity.
On Sunday, FYF flung open its gates, opened up more seating and gave out free water until 6 p.m. in order to make up for the chaos of the first day. Still, the atmosphere remained noticeably different than previous years. Security guards actually combed through the packed crowds confiscating illicit substances and telling those on others’ shoulders to get down due to safety risks. This practice is relatively unheard of, even at more commercial festivals that make no claims of being underground or edgy. Perhaps it is because they are used to dealing with the 90,000 people who come to the Coliseum on gamedays, but security often seemed to be a little too good at their job.
Despite this, Sunday was a marked improvement. Mac DeMarco delighted crowds with his usual antics: mentioning that Jennifer Aniston was back stage, asking who was excited about Kid Rock’s new album and playing a classic DeMarco tongue-in-cheek cover of Bob Marley’s “Jammin’.”
In a similarly self-effacing manner, L.A.-based rapper Earl Sweatshirt interspersed his raucous lyricism with Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” before asking, “Have you ever been playing FYF and thrown up in your mouth a little? That sh-t is crazy.” Later, after asking who wanted to hear real West Coast hip-hop, he told the crowd, “Shut up. You’re from Delaware.”
Whereas Earl Sweatshirt toes the line between the self-described “ignorant” abrasiveness of Odd Future’s trap bangers and his own brooding poetics, Thundercat and Flying Lotus navigate the intersection of jazz and electronic. Both acts juggled the two roles impressively. Though Thundercat’s brother and bandmate Ronald Bruner, Jr. was not present, the more-than-capable Justin Brown filled in on drums and catalyzed a sublimely improvisational rhythm section.
Flying Lotus (and his rapping alter-ego Captain Murphy) continues to defy categorization. The booming bass and trippy visuals of his show consistently attract the young EDM crowds, but he also incorporates complex polyrhythms and drum samples from the likes of Philly Jo Jones and Max Roach, distinguishing his music from more one-dimensional D.J.s. The crowd was treated to a few previews from his upcoming project You’re Dead!, which sounded like they were taken from the score of a David Lynch movie set in space. The project will feature both Kendrick Lamar and Herbie Hancock. By pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a D.J. in such a way, Flying Lotus (who happens to be the grandnephew of John and Alice Coltrane) is making it increasingly difficult for neo-classicists, jazz heads and purists of all kinds to dismiss electronic music as meritless or superficial.
Since its inception in 2004, FYF has come a long way. Though headliners The Strokes and Phoenix are still technically rock acts, they are much more mainstream than original headliners Wires on Fire and Toys that Kill. If anyone was unsure of just how much the demographic has changed, they would have to look no further than the long line of people waiting to take their picture in front of a big sign that read, “I’m here, where are you? #FYF.” Whether FYF assimilates to today’s festival culture or rejects hashtags in favor of its punk origins in the next few years, this year will be remembered as a turning point of sorts. It is true that you can’t please everyone, but this year’s FYF was about as close as they could get.

Though it is vital to maintain professionalism while serving in any public office, people slip sometimes. Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s recent scandal is one distinct case. It involves what Perry believes to be a justified act that falls under the basic right to freedom of speech — but that doesn’t make it any more forgivable.
On Aug. 15, Perry was indicted on two felony counts for abuse of power. He allegedly tried coercing Democratic District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg into resigning by publicly threatening to dismantle a public corruption unit she headed — all because she had pleaded guilty to drunk driving in 2013. In his attempts to control the unit and force a public servant to step down, Perry crossed an ethical line.
At first glance, Perry’s move is common for any governor seeking more power for his or her party. It became ethically abominable, however, when Perry attempted to use Lehmberg’s DUI charges to accomplish this goal. According to the Associated Press, after his indictment, Perry defiantly told reporters, “Americans and Texans who have seen [Lehmberg’s DUI arrest footage] agree with me that that is not an individual who is heading up an office that we can afford to fund.” Feeling that he needed to take care of Lehmberg himself, Perry threatened to drain the public corruption unit of millions of dollars unless she stepped down from her post because he could not support “continued state funding for an office with statewide jurisdiction at a time when the person charged with ultimate responsibility of that unit has lost the public’s confidence,” according to KVUE News.
Ironically, Perry, not Lehmberg, seems to be the one who has truly “lost the public’s confidence.” Though his supposed intentions for wanting Lehmberg to step down seem moral, his actions say otherwise. By threatening to eliminate an important governmental unit just to force a public official to resign because of her personal past, Perry went too far. He not only abused his power as governor, but also lost the country’s trust — a dire misstep if he hopes to run for president in 2016.
According to David L. Botsford, Perry’s lawyer, the veto was “lawful, appropriate and well within the authority of the office of the governor.” Beyond Perry’s apparent rights to such threats as governor, Tony Buzbee, another attorney on the legal team, even argued that the governor’s actions are protected under the “right to free speech under the First Amendment.” Though Buzbee does make a valid point in that Perry has the right to free speech, he fails to understand the true magnitude of the crimes. Perry essentially blackmailed a public official into resigning by claiming that it was on moral grounds when it was, in actuality, about compliance with his demands for personal gain. According to the Los Angeles Times, if Lehmberg stepped down, Perry would have had the ability to assign a Republican to take her place, which could have further helped his political career.
The use of taxpayer money to fund Perry’s defense furthers the immoral aspects of this case. According to The New York Times, the governor’s office has paid almost $80,000 since June to Botsford, marking “one of the first times Texas taxpayers were paying the bill.”
Perry’s actions not only speak for the immorality of political agendas in many cases, but also question the basics of freedom of speech and the use of resources. Perry has disappointed with his actions, and, even worse, betrayed the people of Texas.

With escalating conflicts throughout the Middle East, it’s difficult to worry about anything other than the impending threat of increased American involvement. The news is filled with reports on how many care packages were dropped in Iraq or how many civilians have been killed in the most recent attack on Gaza. But what is frequently overlooked is who exactly those supplies are going to, whose families are being torn apart and forced to flee their homes to escape the violence.
Elizabeth Cutbirth | Daily Trojan
With travel advisories issued by the State Department for the majority of countries in the Middle East, mobility is limited, leaving much of the American population entirely dependent on news delivered by reporters. The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America, however, suggests that some of these reports might be biased or incorrect: CAMERA’s report, published in Time magazine in July, purports that figures regarding casualties in Gaza released by Hamas-affiliated organizations have falsely represented the conflict to audiences in the United States. This level of reliance on potentially false information promotes a disconnect between the average American and the average Middle Easterner, helping to perpetuate the misunderstanding and fear that much of the American population experiences when it comes to the region. All that really separates Americans from Middle Easterners is 7,000 miles, but neither population fully realizes their similarities simply because of a lack of opportunities.
Brandon Stanton — the photographer who founded popular blog Humans of New York — is attempting to change that with his two-month trip to the Middle East. He has traveled to Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Uganda, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo so far on his world tour in order to share the stories of the people affected by these conflicts with his followers back in the United States.
People familiar with HONY might have a difficult time distinguishing between the stories shared on the streets of New York City and those shared on the streets of Amman, Jordan and Shaqlawa, Iraq. Though some of the interviewees do share the struggles of living in the Middle East, many also share stories that depict the same career aspirations, financial struggles and childhood innocence that can be found in New York or any American city.
Though Americans might never agree on what course of action is best in the Middle East, “Humans of the Middle East” deserves more attention. Real stories told by people in the Middle East — such as the stories Stanton is sharing — must replace the ones depicted in the news, which primarily focus on the actions of ISIS and Hamas. The people living in the Middle East have the same desires for happiness and comfort that Americans do; children in Erbil, Iraq and Dhana, Jordan share the same dreams of becoming doctors and pilots. Middle Easterners have the same frustrations with ongoing war and violence; the same hope that one day their country will no longer be divided by opposing beliefs. One young woman explained to Stanton that she hopes to “help work toward unity in the Arab world — both between countries and within countries” to allow the Middle East to return to the cultural and intellectual hub that it once was.
What one must understand, however, is that the majority of people living in the Middle East cannot be characterized by the violence created by the minority. The majority does not support attacks carried out by militant groups. Currently, according to The New York Times, more than 97 percent of the world’s Muslim population does not identify with Salafism, the most extreme and militant Islamic denomination. Thus, the majority suffers from the actions and beliefs of a minute, yet aggressive group of extremists.
For the most part, however, news reports in the United States regarding the Middle East focus on that minority. In a recent CNN article on ISIS, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) was quoted calling the terrorist group a “cancer which has spread throughout that region.” Most of these “Humans of the Middle East” have remained faceless and nameless victims, dehumanized and overcome by the violence they want so desperately to escape, making Stanton’s work all the more necessary.
If the United States hopes to help resolve the issues in the Middle East, Americans must start understanding the people, stories and cultures of the region rather than perpetuating the stereotypes that surround it. There must be more listening, exploring and learning involved rather than hasty, reactionary actions. One of the stories shared on HONY helps highlight just how similar Iraqis, Iranians, Jordanians and Americans all are, seeking the same decency and comfort as anyone else: “If you speak gently, you’ll find good people wherever you go. If you find a bad person, just move on to the next person.” It is time for the United States to heed this lesson when it comes to the Middle East. Rather than focusing on violence, conflict and bigotry within the region, Americans should reach out to the multitude of good “Humans of the Middle East,” the ones that can bring their countries the pride and positive attention they deserve.
 
Your article is of a make-believe world in which the core tenets of Islam are trivialized.  It is these core tenets:  supremacism, submission, misogyny, repression, hatred of others which cause Muslim’s suffering.  
Here are some real facts about what happens where Islam spreads:
As long as the Muslim population remains around 1% of any given country they
will be regarded as a peace-loving minority and not as a threat to anyone. In
fact, they may be featured in articles and films, stereotyped for their
colorful uniqueness:
United States — Muslim 1.0%
Australia — Muslim 1.5%
Canada — Muslim 1.9%
China — Muslim 1%-2%
Italy — Muslim 1.5%
Norway — Muslim 1.8% 
At 2% and 3% they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and
disaffected groups with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs:
Denmark — Muslim 2%
Germany — Muslim 3.7%
United Kingdom — Muslim 2.7%
Spain — Muslim 4%
Thailand — Muslim 4.6% 
From 5% on they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their
percentage of the population. They will push for the introduction of halal
(clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for
Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature it on
their shelves — along with threats for failure to comply.
France — Muslim 8%
Philippines — Muslim 5%
Sweden — Muslim 5%
Switzerland — Muslim 4.3%
The Netherlands — Muslim 5.5%
Trinidad & Tobago — Muslim 5.8%
At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to
rule themselves under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islam is
not to convert the world but to establish Sharia law over the entire world. 
When Muslims reach 10% of the population, they will increase lawlessness as
a means of complaint about their conditions (Paris — car burnings, etc.). Any
non-Muslim action that offends Islam will result in uprisings and threats
(Amsterdam — Mohammed cartoons).
Guyana — Muslim 10%
India — Muslim 13.4%
Israel — Muslim 16%
Kenya — Muslim 10%
Russia — Muslim 10-15% 
After reaching 20% expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations,
sporadic killings and church and synagogue burning:
Ethiopia — Muslim 32.8%
At 40% you will find widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks and ongoing
militia warfare:
Bosnia — Muslim 40%
Chad — Muslim 53.1%
Lebanon — Muslim 59.7% 
From 60% you may expect unfettered persecution of non-believers and other
religions, sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon
and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels:
Albania — Muslim 70%
Malaysia — Muslim 60.4%
Qatar — Muslim 77.5%
Sudan — Muslim 70% 
After 80% expect State run ethnic cleansing and genocide:
Bangladesh — Muslim 83%
Egypt — Muslim 90%
Gaza — Muslim 98.7%
Indonesia — Muslim 86.1%
Iran — Muslim 98%
Iraq — Muslim 97%
Jordan — Muslim 92%
Morocco — Muslim 98.7%
Pakistan — Muslim 97%
Syria — Muslim 90%
Tajikistan — Muslim 90%
Turkey — Muslim 99.8%
United Arab Emirates — Muslim 96% 
100% will usher in the peace of “Dar-es-Salaam” — the Islamic House of Peace
— there’s supposed to be peace because everybody is a Muslim:
Afghanistan — Muslim 100%
Saudi Arabia — Muslim 100%
Somalia — Muslim 100%
Yemen — Muslim 99.9% 
Of course, that’s not the case. To satisfy their blood lust, Muslims then
start killing each other for a variety of reasons.

The story behind USC senior defensive back Josh Shaw’s recent ankle injury took a bizarre turn today, as the validity of his version of events came into question. Head coach Steve Sarkisian announced at practice this morning that the athletic department had received several calls questioning Shaw’s claims that he suffered two high ankle sprains in the act of saving his young nephew from drowning last Saturday night. Sarkisian voiced his support of the newly named co-captain, but was clear that USC would investigate the incident further.
“Within the last few hours or so we have gotten a few calls contradicting what Josh said occurred Saturday night,” Sarkisian said. “We’re going to continue to vet it. We’re going to look at it.”
The incident, which took place in Shaw’s home of Palmdale, California, came under further scrutiny when anonymous sources later claimed that there was a police inquiry underway. The Palmdale Sheriff’s Department quickly denied that they had any information on an investigation regarding Shaw, followed by a similar denial from the Los Angeles Police Department.
LAPD, which had planned a news conference this afternoon, was adamant that it had nothing to do with Shaw.
As a mob of reporters circled around him this morning, Sarkisian defended Shaw’s character and stood behind him.
“He’s a good person,” Sarkisian said. “He’s a good kid. He came to us with what had occurred Saturday night and I have no reason, no history to not believe Josh and his story.”

Verna and Peter Dauterive Hall, USC’s first interdisciplinary social sciences building, opened for the first day of classes on Monday.
Dauterive Hall, which was spearheaded by the Provosts’ office rather than an individual school, will have a special emphasis on collaboration and interdisciplinary studies.
Working together · The $30 million building will house several research institutes and its entire lower level will be dedicated to research. — Christine Yoo | Daily Trojan
“The donor, Verna Dauterive, had a vision for the building that it be a space activated with students, and focused on collaboration,” said Rob Cooper, vice provost for academic operations and strategy.
Dauterive, an honorary USC Trustee, pledged $30 million for the six-story, 110,000-square-foot building in 2008, in memory of her late husband Peter Dauterive. Construction began in fall 2012, and the building was completed on-time and on-budget at the end of June 2014.
Classrooms located on the ground level of the building will host undergraduate and graduate courses across a variety of subjects in the David and Dana Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the Marshall School of Business, the Gould School of Law and the Sol Price School of Public Policy, among others.
The centerpiece of the building is a five-story atrium that will house several research institutes including the Center for Economic and Social Research, Center for Mind and Society, Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy and the Sol Price Center for Social Innovation.
“We chose an architect that could help us create our vision of collaborative space and what it meant to researchers,” Cooper said. “The atrium building will allow collaboration to be based in the center of the [hall].”
Provost Professor of Psychology and Marketing Norbert Schwarz and Dean’s Professor of Psychology Daphna Oyserman brought the USC Dornsife Mind and Society Center to the university from the University of Michigan last year. They look forward to utilizing the building.
“The building has excellent research space,” Schwarz said. “The whole lower level is research space for interviews, laboratories and space for representative panels for surveys, so there’s great infrastructure.”
Though much of the space will be used for research, undergraduate students are also looking to capitalize on the collaborative nature of the building.
Dauterive Hall will also be looking to add more research institutes to the building. Only two of five atrium floors are currently occupied. Administrators and faculty look forward to using the remaining areas as a collaborative space.
“Collaboration is always important, and is one of the hallmarks in what USC believes in for students, faculty and research centers,” said Bonnie Reiss, global director of the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy.

Wall damage. Room cleaning. Miscellaneous charges. These are just a few of the assorted fees that some students face after they move out of USC Housing.
Landing in email inboxes approximately a month after the students turn in their keys, the charges often serve as an unwelcome surprise to those already a few weeks into their summer vacations.
Surprise! · Some students in Fluor Tower (above) were not expecting cleaning fees and other charges after move out. — Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
“I was completely blindsided,” Ahlia Bethea, a Fluor Tower resident during the 2013-2014 school year, said. “Everything was in great condition [when I left], everything was clean, but my suite was still all charged a fee for cleaning and damages.”
The process starts at the beginning of the year, when residents complete a room inventory form that assesses the current condition of their apartment, dorm or suite. Then, during move-out, that form is utilized by the students’ respective residential advisors to assess any visible damages that may have accumulated during the year.
Once the RA signs off that everything is empty, clean and organized, residents are free to leave. Often, students think this is their final inspection. It isn’t.
In fact, the RA’s final walk-through only plays a small part, if any, in determining whether students will face monetary charges.
“The role of the RAs at move out is to work with the residents on sorting out responsibility for any damage/cleaning charges as well as note what the room looked like when they met with each resident upon them vacating housing,” wrote USC Housing Director Kennan Cheung in an email to the Daily Trojan. “They do not make decisions on charges nor quote any pricing.”
Instead, Cheung explained, that billing lies in the hands of housing staff who perform their own separate inspections. Like the RAs, workers utilize the room inventory form from move-in, as well as information from the RA’s assessment and “any other factors that may have come up over the year to determine charges.”
Officially, the 2013-2014 USC Housing Living Agreement states that “any damage to University operated facilities caused by the Resident or his/her guest(s) beyond that arising from normal wear and tear will be charged to the Resident.”
What constitutes “normal wear and tear,” however, is largely under the discretion of the housing staff. For example, Cheung noted that things such as light stains and dirty spots are expected but burns, holes in the wall and nail holes are not.
“The housing staff spends a great deal of time with this process, and we try to be as equitable as possible,” he wrote.
Nevertheless, that hasn’t stopped some residents from arguing that these charges are being overblown. Often, the disagreement stems from confusion on what exactly constitutes finable damage.
Roohi Kumar, a Fluor Tower resident last year, mentioned that when she and her suitemates were filling out room inventory forms during move-in, housing staff said only to document “major damage.”
“We were told it just had to be major damage that we could have possibly been billed for,” she said. “We didn’t report minor chips and what not because we didn’t consider that to be major damage, and at the end of the year it turns out that’s exactly what they billed us for — tiny little chips in the desk and around the wall.”
She said many of the marks had been there from previous years, but because of what she was told, she didn’t note them at the time.
These charges can be expensive as well, with some students facing fees of up to $100 or more. Deb Bello, who lived in Webb Tower last year, said she was billed $75 for “necessary patching and painting of multiple spots on [her] side of the studio apartment,” which she claims wasn’t the case when she moved out.
Other miscellaneous charges resulting from things being left behind were also reportedly severe.
Orlando Nieves, a Webb Tower resident during the 2013-2014 school year, said he was charged $90 for leaving a mirror in his bedroom. Similarly, Emile Indik, who lived in Pardee Tower during the same time, said he was billed $100 for leaving clothes in one of his drawers.
“I’m assuming [it was] a service charge of moving the clothes to the trash,” Indik said. “However, I don’t plan to pay them. This kind of thing can easily be fought.”
For those like Indik who feel the charges are unwarranted and want to fight them, USC Housing does have an appeal process.
After students receive an email with an attached receipt of their fees, they have 30 days to make an appeal in writing. Cheung wrote that Housing usually then provides photo evidence of the damage, as well as the room inventory forms that compare the unit during move-in with it during move-out.
Student’s response to the appeal process, however, seems to be mixed.
Kumar, for instance, mentioned how she and her roommate reached out to Housing within the given time frame, but didn’t hear anything back explaining their charges.
“It was pretty obnoxious of [the Housing staff] because we’re still not sure what we were charged for,” she said. “We appealed but we never heard back.“
Bethea said she was familiar with stories like Kumar’s, and chose to pay instead of dealing with the appeal process.
“It didn’t even feel like it was worth it,” she said.
For those who do hear back about their appeals, explanations behind the charges are given with pictures attached documenting said damage.
One Fluor Tower resident who wished to remain anonymous shared the pictures housing sent them with the Daily Trojan, and stated they didn’t feel the damage depicted in the photos (smudges on the wall) warranted the fees given.
“They basically just sent me pictures of my wall that had smudges on them and said I had to pay it,” the resident said. “I paid $60 for black smudges.”
Though the majority of students who came forward were from apartment and suites at Webb and Fluor, Cheung said the frequency of charges depend more on the students living there that year rather than the specific buildings.
Nevertheless, the Fluor and Webb complex did reportedly receive a record high number of disputes this year.
“We have had one of the busiest summers in years aside from receiving over 200 emails and counting regarding disputes,” wrote Fluor Tower CSC student supervisor Patrick Falcon in response to one student’s appeal. Neither Falcon nor Cheung responded to why there was an increase.
While many are viewing these charges as punitive actions, Cheung stressed that these fees shouldn’t be seen as “fines,” but rather maintenance expenses in order to restore the proper conditions to future residents.
“It’s … not a ‘fine’ but a cost to return the building/area/room to how it was at move-in,” he wrote. “We believe the incoming residents deserve to have rooms and apartments be in the same condition as they were for the previous residents.”
It seems, however, it is not so much the terminology of the charge that confuses residents, but rather what exactly they can be billed for.
“We [as residents] weren’t really properly informed … It’s kind of this like boogeyman figure,” Bethea said. “You don’t really have an idea of what’s going to be charged.”

The Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy officially opens this semester, and its newly-built student workspace reflects the Academy’s focus on innovation.
The Recipe · The Academy brings together professors from USC Annenberg, Marshall, Viterbi and Roski in a new, innovative space. – Min Haeng Cho | Daily Trojan
Inside the Academy on the fourth floor of the Tutor Campus Center, the 31 students of the Academy’s inaugural class have made their mark with their signatures on the central column. These students will begin the program this fall to achieve a degree in Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation or, as the university has referred to it, a “degree in disruption.”
The Academy, created by a $70 million donation from Iovine and Young that was announced in May  2013, was inspired in part by the success the duo had when they fused pop culture with innovation in founding Beats Electronics, maker of the hugely successful audio device Beats by Dr. Dre. The academy’s mission is to encourage 25 to 30 students each year to replicate and even outdo that work.
“Many of the students had seen the space when it was raw, when they came in February for the interview weekend,” Jessica Vernon, senior advisor and recruiter for the Academy said. “For them to come in and see the finished product … The idea that I’ve got from the students is that it is even better than they had imagined,” she said.
The Academy’s entrance is “the Garage,” a spacious open workspace whose name pays homage to the ideas that were cultivated in garages across America by innovators such as Steve Jobs. Inside is the necessary equipment: several 3-D printers sit along a wall, next to display cases ready to showcase the prototypes and concepts that can be printed in plastic from digital or hard designs. Digital workstations complete with large TV screens, laptop plugins and speakers sit around the edges of the room.
Doors from the Garage lead to two classrooms and the Shop, a room full of wood and metal working tools and a sandblaster that Vernon affectionately refers to as “the dirty space.” Down the hall from the dirty space is the Fab Room, which contains a refrigerator-sized 3-D printer and an industrial laser cutter and engraver. In the Shop and the Fab Room, Vernon says, students will do everything from building drones to using the printers to materialize their ideas via rapid prototyping.
The Academy’s facilities will be used in conjunction with an exclusive curriculum developed by professors from the Marshall School of Business, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, the Roski School of Art and Design and the Viterbi School of Engineering. Students will pick two of five areas of “emphasis” that include venture management, audio design, communication, visual design and technology.
“I just can’t wait to see what they do,” Vernon said. “I’m excited to see how they really bond together and the type of team projects they work on together.”
One of those students is freshman Luke McGartland, who knew he’d find a home at the Academy from the moment he received his acceptance letter in the form of a personalized YouTube message from Iovine and Young.
“I watched it about 50 times,” McGartland said.
For McGartland, the best thing about the Academy is the sense of finding a group of individuals similar to him.
“We all have the same sort of strain of DNA,” he said. “No else quite got what we were thinking of back in high school. You can have a great idea, but without a great team you aren’t going to be able to do as well as you could.”
Luke, who filled a 240-page notebook in high school with ideas for everything from app designs to inventions, now has that team at the Academy.
Students are challenged to continuously innovate as seen in a picture of Jimmy Iovine that sits on the wall just next to the Academy’s conference room, which is equipped to host digital lectures with high-profile industry leaders.
“Think you’re as innovative as this guy?” the poster asks. “He’s betting on it.”
UPDATE, Aug. 26, 10:35 p.m.: This article has been updated to reflect factual changes and minor edits. The Thornton School of Music is no longer affiliated with the Iovine and Young Academy.

The Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Foundation announced a $30 million donation Wednesday to endow the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Foundation Honors Hall in the new Village, which is currently under construction. The honors hall, which is set to open with the rest of The Village in fall 2017, will have approximately 600 beds exclusively for freshman honors students.
The honors college, which will house both the Kathleen L. McCarthy Honors College and the Honors Residence Hall, will be one of five residential colleges to be built as part of the billion-dollar USC Village project. The Village is expected to add approximately 2,700 beds of additional student housing.
“It will give so many more students the opportunity to live on campus, which will be a tremendous benefit to them,” McCarthy said in a statement. “USC Village is going to be a very special addition to the university, and we feel fortunate to make a gift to help start it off.”
The honors college, which will serve as the residential component of the honors program that is currently in place, will also provide exclusive academic, cultural and social programming for freshman honors students. These  include  mentorships from university faculty, honors seminars and one-on-one advising. The Leavey Foundation gift will go exclusively towards funding residential college programming, as opposed to the actual construction of the facility.
“What we’re doing now is making the honors program more robust,” Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “This gift in particular and other gifts like this give us a chance to build the 21st century global research university residential experience. Over the next three years, you’ll see a rapid enhancement on the quality of life and living at ’SC because of gifts like this.”
Carry said the university aims to emulate the scholarship and community found in the Greek system by enhancing the residential college experience on campus.
“Residential colleges are where people live together and learn together, and we already have something similar to that — our Greek system,” Carry said. “We want people to feel the same affinity that they do with their Greek organizations with their residential colleges. We want to duplicate the level of engagement and family that is not Greek-affiliated.”
The Los Angeles-based Leavey Foundation was founded in 1952 Thomas Leavey, a co-founder of Farmers Insurance Group, and his wife, Dorothy. The foundation, which ranks as one of the largest philanthropic organizations in California, is chaired by their daughter, USC Trustee Kathleen Leavey McCarthy, who graduated from USC in 1957.
“Kathleen McCarthy has an abiding passion for our students and understands the importance of providing them with supportive and intellectually engaging residential communities,” President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement. “We’re tremendously grateful that she stepped forward to make the first major gift to the USC Village, a project that will immeasurably enhance residential life for our students.”
This isn’t the first time the Leavey Foundation has donated to the university. The foundation has had a long history of philanthropy at USC, with past contributions including gifts for both Leavey Library and McCarthy Quad, as well as various scholarship endowments. In all, the foundation has donated more than $200 million to different institutions, including Georgetown University, Loyola Marymount University and Santa Clara University.
This gift comes in the midst of the university’s “Campaign for the University of Southern California,” which aims to raise $6 billion for academic programs and building projects. Now in its third year, the campaign has raised more than $3.5 billion.
The Village is also expected to include a full-service grocery store and 100,000 square feet of retail space. The formal groundbreaking will take place on Sept. 15.
