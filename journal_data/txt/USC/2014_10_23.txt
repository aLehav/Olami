The Geek Speak lecture series continued this semester at the School of Cinematic Arts on Thursday night with an event titled “The Future of Comics,” featuring a one-on-one conversation between Scott McCloud, leading comics theorist and author of the “Comic Trilogy,” and Henry Jenkins, USC Provost’s Professor of Communication, Journalism, Cinematic Arts and Education.

The Geek Speak lecture panel celebrated the 15th anniversary of the second book in McCloud’s trilogy, Reinventing Comics: How Imagination and Technology Are Revolutionizing an Art Form. The event was co-sponsored by the Annenberg Innovation Lab, the Visual Studies Research Institute, the USC Interactive Media & Games Division, and the USC John C. Hench Division of Animation and Digital Arts.
“Henry wanted to create an event where the geekier among USC had an opportunity to come together and discuss things like comics and video games,” said Geoffrey Long, the technical director and a research fellow for the Annenberg Innovation Lab.
McCloud talked about the creative process that went along with writing his book. He said that comics on the web used to be black and white comic strips that loaded extremely slowly. With the open architecture of the web, McCloud became obsessed with the possibility of digital spaces and with reinventing the commerce and the shape of comics online.
Jenkins and McCloud discussed the idea of producing comics on an infinite canvas, as opposed to limiting the reading experience to a contained rectangle.
“With these comics, we should be trying to maintain a sustained narrative spell of pulling [the reader] in, eliminating distractions and creating a seamless comic experience,” McCloud said.
He believes that the ideal comic experience on the web should have simplicity and an interface with an intuitive quality of single-mode navigation.
Something that print comic books have that digital comics do not is scarcity, and that’s why physical comics are so valuable.
“Will digital comics lose their value over time? Yes. Digital comics are weird because digital comics, much like digital music, are not objects so much as they are licenses. In the same way that you license a piece of software, but you never truly own it, you’re kind of seeing the same thing with comics,” Long said.
McCloud also mentioned that his initial prediction was that comics would become a majority female industry.
“It seems to take a little while [for the gender change in the industry to begin], but one day you can wake up and realize that you’ve crossed the threshold into a new diversified comic community,” McCloud said.
He said that these gender roles shifted quickly -— with a few brilliant women creators, there was a new message sent out to female readers who would eventually go to art school and become comic writers themselves.
Long brought up the ease of access for comic book fans and those getting into comics for the first time.
“It used to be that you couldn’t go back and find the particular issue in which something important happened or a character first appeared,” Long said. “If you wanted to read that comic, you had to go find some long box in a dusty corner somewhere and track down the actual physical object. Then we moved into a period where more and more comics were being collected into trade paperbacks. Now, anybody can find virtually any comic from any point in history through these digital platforms.”
McCloud said he believes comics will continue to survive despite the popularity of film.
“I think comics will continue to be a minority form compared to the moving image. But I still think it has legs. It doesn’t have to go away. It’s just a simple idea, and all art forms that last are predicated on simple ideas,” McCloud said.
Following the one-on-one discussion, a panel of comic specialists covered topics present in McCloud’s book, Reinventing Comics, such as the evolution of comics with the incorporation of modern technology like motion, sound and interactivity. Long said that the reason for putting this group of panelists together was to think about where comics are going from the perspective of new creators, users and implementations.
The panel of respondents included Daniel Burwen of Cognito Comics, Hank Kanalz of Vertigo and DC Entertainment, Joe LeFavi of Quixotic Transmedia, Long, Patrick Chappatte, editorial cartoonist for The International New York Times and Diana Williams of Lucasfilm.
“It was really nice to see how the panelists were thinking about comics in terms of interactivity, especially now that content is migrating online,” said Rachel Victor, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience. “So it’s looking beyond how we have the very linear, physical comic format. And now when it goes online, how [does] that change how we deliver it, the form of the content, and how does it change the interactivity of the content.”

Prosecution attorney Daniel Akemon presented his closing arguments to the jury on the sixth day of the trial of Javier Bolden Thursday morning at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in downtown Los Angeles.
Bolden, 22, is charged with the 2012 murders of USC graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu. He is also charged with attempted murder and assault with a firearm, the details of which came to light in Thursday’s testimony.
On the night of Feb. 12, 2012, Javier Bolden entered a party at a banquet hall in the Vermont Square neighborhood in South Los Angeles armed with a semi-automatic 9-millimeter Luger pistol. Bolden appeared “turned up in the wrong way,” said Charles Darden, a witness who testified to the scene.
Following an altercation inside the banquet hall, Bolden allegedly shot and critically wounded two people and fled the scene of the crime. Authorities recovered shell casings from the Vermont Square incident that matched those linked to the April murders of Qu and Wu.
Akemon argued that Bolden assisted Bryan Barnes, who plead guilty to the murder of Qu and Wu and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
Though Bolden did not fire the gun that killed the two students, he participated in the robbery alongside Barnes. Bolden is accountable for Barnes’s actions under the felony murder rule, which states that all participants in a felony or attempted felony can be charged with and found guilty of murder.
“Mr. Bolden is not the type of guy to let things go … Mr. Bolden is going to go take care of business, and that’s what he did,” Akemon said, referring to the Vermont Square incident.
When Bolden was apprehended by police officers in May, he told his cellmate, a confidential informant, that he had been involved in the USC killings. The prosecution showed a video of Bolden’s admission during Thursday’s proceedings.
“I looked at him [Qu]. He was leaned over … She [Wu] was laying there … and I took off running,” Bolden said in the video.
At the end of his closing argument, Akemon told the jury that there was “no mystery in this case.”
“The people ask that you find Mr. Bolden guilty of the murder of Ming Wu and the murder of Ying Qu and that you find true the special circumstances that they were murdered during the course of a robbery,” Akemon said.
During the defense’s closing argument, alternate public defender Andrew Goldman said that evidence of only two shell casings found at the scene of the Vermont Square shooting did not necessarily indicate that only two bullets were fired.
He said there was a possibility of another shooter with a revolver, saying that revolvers retain shell casings after bullets are fired.
Goldman characterized Bolden as “cold, scared and young” in his interrogation with police detectives in which he said he was involved in the USC murders. Bolden was 19 at the time of the interview.
Goldman argued that police had intimidated Bolden during the interrogation by mentioning the possibility of the death penalty.
“We don’t want to play games with you,” Detective Vincent Carreon said. “We want to give you the opportunity to tell us what happened out there.”
The lawyers also argued about the significance of the vehicle that the two victims were sitting in when they were shot. Bolden identified the car as a blue BMW 7 Series. In fact, the car was a gray BMW 3 Series.
Goldman said that Bolden’s lack of knowledge about the details of the crime in his conversation with the police informant showed that he was fabricating his involvement to appear tough to his cellmate.
“These are the details, these are the things that are important,” Goldman said in his closing argument.
Akemon disagreed, saying that Bolden was going into excruciating detail about things only the killer would know and that the discrepancies were a difficult distinction to make when fleeing from the crime scene.
The murders took place around 1 a.m. on April 11, 2012. It was raining at the time of the shooting.
Akemon also said that the mention of the death penalty had no visible effect on Mr. Bolden.
“I’d be a blubbering pile of goo at that moment,” Akemon said.
In his rebuttal, he characterized Bolden as a street smart individual who could hold his own with police detectives.
Judge Stephen A. Marcus will give the jury, made up of seven females and five males, instructions today. A verdict is expected to be reached soon.

USC hosted the groundbreaking ceremony for the Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience on Thursday.
The building was made possible by a $50 million gift from philanthropist Dr. Gary K. Michelson and marks a significant milestone in support of the university’s fundraising campaign to garner $6 billion in donations by 2018. In the three years since its launch, the campaign has already raised $3.71 billion.
The center will be located in the southwest quadrant of the University Park Campus, home to the majority of USC’s science and engineering buildings, and is scheduled for completion within the next three years.
The new 190,000-square-foot facility will stand four stories high and include state-of-the-art laboratories as well as a nanofabrication facility, a suite of microscopy imaging technology, and the Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis. The center aims to be a leading hub of science and technology and a cornerstone of collaboration, forming a bridge between the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Viterbi School of Engineering.
“[Michelson] has a burning passion for how the rate of biomedicine needs to move faster so that we can deliver treatments for diseases that are not yet understood,” Dornsife Dean Steve Kay said following the groundbreaking. “We need a new attitude. We need students to be trained in multiple fields so that students don’t recognize themselves as engineers or physicists or biologists, [but rather that] students recognize themselves as problem solvers.”
Michelson, a retired orthopedic spinal surgeon, has generated more than 955 issued or pending patents worldwide. Michelson did not graduate from USC and was not affiliated with USC prior to making the donation.
“We have all been moved by how quickly Gary Michelson has become a Trojan and an invaluable member of the Trojan Family,” said President C.L. Max Nikias during his speech.
The building will not only draw the best and brightest students and faculty of USC into its laboratories and innovative work spaces, but also serve as a new home to key researchers from across the many fields of science and engineering, including two top scientists from the Scripps Research Institute: biochemist Raymond Stevens and biologist Peter Kuhn.
Stevens’ research focus is on the structure of proteins; he is most famous for his collaboration with Gilead, an American biotechnology company, on research that led to the creation of Tamiflu — a drug that prevents and slows the spread of influenza.
Stevens’ move to USC is actually a homecoming: He received his doctorate at USC under the guidance of Noble Prize-winning chemist George Olah. His former colleague at the Scripps Research Institute, cell biologist and physicist Kuhn, has also made major strides in the field of medical research, having developed an experimental method that can be used to target and analyze cells that break away from tumors. The ability to spot these cells sooner has the potential to detect and treat cancer in its early stages.
“Los Angeles should become to medical research what Silicon Valley is to information and technology,” Dr. Michelson said to the crowd gathered at the ceremony. “We owe it to the world; we owe it to Los Angeles. We need to invest in this.”

Reeling from their longest losing streak of the season, the USC women’s soccer team will look to get back on track when they head north to the state of Oregon and battle both Oregon and Oregon State this upcoming weekend.
Bang bang · Junior forward Katie Johnson leads USC in shots taken this year (35) and shots on goal (17). She’s scored on four of her attempts. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
 
The Women of Troy (8-5-2, 2-4-0 Pac-12) have lost three games in a row, but during their visit to the Beaver State, they will have a chance to turn things around against an Oregon team (6-6-2, 2-3-1) that has lost their last two games, as well as an Oregon State squad (0-12-3, 0-6) still without its first win.
Pac-12 play has not gone the way this team hoped it would so far, and given USC’s superb pre-conference play performance, it is safe to say the team did not expect to lose four games through their first six.
Yet that is the reality of the ruthless gauntlet that is women’s soccer in the Pac-12. Beating conference foes remains a tall task for any team, and the Women of Troy have been yet another testament to that.
“This is the Pac-12,” USC head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “You can’t overlook anyone.”
Having already dropped four toughly contested games without playing three of the top five teams in the conference, they have fallen prey to the high level of competition this conference brings every single match.
But all is not lost for this squad, especially given the fight they showed throughout their slate of nonconference games and their resilient mindset going into this four-game road trip.
“I like the fact that we’ve given ourselves a chance in every game,” McAlpine said. “I think the biggest thing for us is we have to remember that we are a quality team.”
Their willingness to return to their winning ways may be present, but with only three matches left after this weekend’s duo, time is quickly expiring.
These two matches will be crucial, as the Women of Troy will be paired up with some of their weaker opponents in the conference. If USC comes out of the weekend unscathed and undefeated, the team’s confidence will take a much-needed boost, as will its record in conference play.
On Friday, their offense will be tested when they face an Oregon team that has been particularly stingy on defense. The Ducks have allowed only one goal or fewer in 12 of their 14 games this season. With the Trojan offense having scored only a single goal in its past three games, the battle to put the ball in the net will be key.
“We just haven’t put enough quality chances on frame,” McAlpine pointed out. “The biggest thing is to remain aggressive, with the understanding that one of them is going to go in.”
Sunday’s match against the Beavers will also test the team’s ability to take care of winnable games. Though winless, Oregon State will be looking to get that first victory on the board, and seeing the Women of Troy with three straight losses will only boost their confidence even more.
With every match from here on out being crucial, the Women of Troy will need to jumpstart their turnaround this very weekend when they try to get back to their winning ways. Two wins to start this set of matches away from McAlister Field, and the subsequent six points could vault them back into the mix in the ever-competitive Pac-12.
“The road is going to be good for us,” McAlpine said. “[It is] a chance to refocus, to really get back together and regroup.”

I miss Lane Kiffin.
There, I said it.
Following a disastrous 2012 campaign which saw the preseason No. 1-ranked Trojans slide to a 7-6 record, losing five of their last six games, Kiffin was on thin ice with USC administration and fans, but I always had a soft spot for the Nebraska-born bruiser.
My freshman year, Kiff led the Trojans to a 10-2 record, highlighted by an upset of then-No. 4 Oregon at Autzen Stadium and a 50-0 walloping of UCLA at home to close out the season. The sanctions imposed on USC’s team that year let the Bruins walk away with the Pac-12 South crown, but there was an arrogance among students and alumni alike that made it fun to be a Trojan.
Though Kiffin produced results on the field, he was always stiff and not very media-friendly. He couldn’t follow up the pizazz of Pete Carroll, so fans didn’t appreciate him.
Outside of that 7-6 mark, Kiffin’s unbelievably uncomfortable and hilarious 30-second press conference might have been the beginning of the end for him. For those of you too young to remember (says the newly-turned 21-year-old), Kiffin decided to stop discussing player injuries with the media during the 2012 season, so when a reporter asked him about someone’s status one September day, he brusquely responded, “I don’t know,” sighed lamentingly, and cut another reporter off by saying, “I gotta go” and ditching the media scrum entirely.
Entering 2013, Kiffin’s inability to pick a starting quarterback and his loss to Washington State in the Trojans’ home opener had people calling for his head.
Then, as we all remember, Kiffin went down in flames and was fired in unceremonious fashion at LAX after USC’s 62-41 loss to ASU.
After all this, Trojan fans love to hate Lane Kiffin.
But there might be a place that hates Kiffin even more than people do here: Knoxville, Tennessee.
Before coming to USC, Kiffin was the head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers (after, of course, being fired four games into his second season as Oakland Raiders head coach). He coached the Vols for the 2009 season, before bolting on Jan. 12, 2010, in what I like to picture as a midnight getaway, clutching his wife and kids tightly as they ran through the forest, hoping to be unseen.
Fans were outraged, and apparently still hold a grudge.
This weekend, Kiffin, who took his talents to Tuscaloosa after being fired from USC, returns to Knoxville as Alabama’s offensive coordinator. No. 4 Alabama (6-1, 3-1 SEC) is taking on unranked Tennessee (3-4, 0-3 SEC) in a 4:30 PT kickoff, which will be broadcast on ESPN2.
The storyline was big enough on its own. Then comedian Daniel Tosh weighed in, taking advantage of his striking resemblance to Kiffin to parody him doing a call-in radio show called “Kiffin’s Krimson Korner,” which doesn’t quite turn out well for the character.
Kiffin’s own mother added fuel to the fire next, because Kiffin just can’t quite ever get enough bad press.
“I’m scared to death for his safety,” said Kiffin’s mother, Robin. “I want him to be in the press box.”
The idea of Lane Kiffin hiding up in the press box is one of the funniest things I’ve ever pictured, and it made me wonder how he would be received if he came back to USC for a game.
Kiffin did have one successful year at USC. Students and alumni were boastful of the 10-2 record, and even bought weird knockoff “Pac-12 South Champion” T-shirts as a shot at UCLA and the NCAA.
In his book, The Contrarian’s Guide to Leadership, former USC president Steven B. Sample asserts that leadership is often situational and that a leader who succeeds at one point in time might not be the right leader at a different time.
This is how I see Kiffin’s situation at USC. In his own odd way, his “me against the world” reputation was perfect for the Trojans in 2011. They were facing scholarship sanctions, they weren’t bowl eligible and the whole nation was rooting against them. Kiffin harnessed all of that negative energy and produced results.
The next year, the situation was different (as USC was ranked No. 1 in the preseason poll) and it appeared that Kiffin was not the right leader at that time. Though some of his ignominious play calls annoyed Trojan fans everywhere, I’m honestly thankful that I’ve had such an entertaining couple of football seasons in my time here at USC.
So I don’t know about you, but I’m rooting for Lane Kiffin and Alabama this weekend.
Roll Tide?

The high-flying USC offense will face a tough test this Saturday night when the team hits the road to face the stingy Utah Utes. The No. 20 Trojans (5-2, 4-1 Pac-12) hammered Colorado 56-28 last Saturday behind a record-setting day from redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler. Kessler and his teammates will have their work cut out for them in Salt Lake City, however, against the Pac-12’s second-best scoring defense.
Hold down the fort · Junior defensive end Leonard Williams will be tasked with slowing down Utes running back Devontae Booker, who rushed for 229 yards in Utah’s game against Oregon State last week. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The No. 19 Utes (5-1, 2-1), owners of an upset win over then-No. 8 UCLA on Oct. 4, allow just 21.7 points per game, and are a one-point loss to Washington State away from being undefeated. The team is coming off of a double-overtime victory over Oregon State last Thursday night, leaving them two extra days to prepare for head coach Steve Sarkisian’s Trojans. For his part, Sarkisian acknowledged that Utah should be a tough opponent.
“They’ve always been very good on defense,” Sarkisian said. “They’ve always been aggressive. They’re doing it their way and its been successful for them thus far.”
The Utes’ impressive defense is anchored by the two-headed monster of defensive end Nate Orchard and outside linebacker Jared Norris. Norris is the Pac-12’s second-leading tackler with 58, good for an average of 9.7 per game. Orchard, a blue-chip NFL prospect, is second in the conference in sacks (10.5) and third in tackles for loss (13). Linebacker Gionni Paul, a transfer from Miami, has also made an impact after missing the first two games of the season. Following a 14-tackle effort in a road win over Michigan — his first game in a Utes’ uniform — Paul was named Athlon’s National Defensive Player of the Week. Sarkisian has no qualms about Utah’s defensive strategy.
“They’re just committed to rushing the passer,” Sarkisian said. “Their defensive ends are going to go and sack the quarterback. That’s their intent, and they’ve got talented guys. We have to have a good gameplan in place to neutralize their scheme and try to limit their confidence.”
If the Utes are a force without the ball, they have been anything but with it. Quarterback Travis Wilson, who overcame career-threatening concussion issues to return to the team this season, is struggling to regain his old form. Backup Kendal Thompson, who replaced Wilson in the team’s win over UCLA, has performed only slightly better. The pair owns a 58 percent completion percentage, the worst in the Pac-12, and averages only 191.8 yards per game through the air, good for second-worst in the conference. Though Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham named Wilson the team’s starter for Saturday’s contest, the Trojans know that they should be ready to face Thompson at any point.
“[Thompson and Wilson] both like to run,” sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens said. “They do the same type of things with both QBs. We just gotta be ready to play. We’re going to stick to what our gameplan is and execute.”
The Utes’ saving grace on the offensive side of the ball has come in the form of running back Devontae Booker. The Sacramento, California, native is the Pac-12’s third-leading rusher — behind only USC redshirt junior Javorius “Buck” Allen — with 742 yards, good for an average of 123.7 per game. Booker torched Oregon State for 229 yards and three touchdowns last week, including the game-winning score in double overtime. Stopping Booker will be crucial for the Trojans, who have already given up 12 rushing touchdowns this season.
“I think [Booker]’s a great running back,” senior linebacker Anthony Sarao said. “You have to stop that run, a lot of teams like to run the ball when they’re at home. We can’t have just one guy trying to make one tackle.”
Sarkisian noted that the Utes have come into their own as a power running team.
“[Utah] has kind of philosophically changed from year to year,” Sarkisian said. “They’ve got some really quality minds with a great deal of experience on the offensive side of the ball. They found a niche to be a downfield running team this year.”
USC leads the all-time series 9-3, with the Trojans’ last loss to Utah coming in the 2001 Las Vegas Bowl. This year’s matchup will kick off from Rice-Eccles Stadium at 7 p.m. PST on Saturday night. Cravens played down concerns that the Utes’ notoriously loud home crowd could be a factor, especially for younger players.
“I love a big crowd, especially in an away game like this,” Cravens said. “I love when the crowd’s booing us and when it’s loud. I’m going to talk to the freshmen and tell them, ‘Don’t let the crowd get you, just play your game.’”

The Avengers won’t assemble again until this May, but Marvel is already busy thinking of ways to tear them apart.
The news that Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) will co-star alongside Chris Evans’ Cap in Anthony and Joe Russo’s upcoming Captain America 3 has prompted ardent speculation that Disney and Marvel are gearing up for a big-screen adaptation of Civil War, the massive, politically-charged crossover event that shook the foundations of the Marvel universe to its four-color core when the seven-issue limited series was released in the summer of 2006.
Team divided · An argument between Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Chris Evans) over the merits of Superhuman Registration results in a superhero schism in Marvel’s epic crossover storyline Civil War. – Photo courtesy of Marvel Comics
The story, written by Kick-Ass and Wanted creator Mark Millar, follows the disbanding of the Avengers after a bitter falling out between Cap and Iron Man over the latter’s support of the controversial Superhuman Registration Act, a piece of legislation requiring all costumed adventurers operating in the United States to reveal their true identities and serve at the whim of the U.S. government, either as salaried S.H.I.E.L.D. employees or glorified police officers. The law, a thinly veiled allegory for the Patriot Act and the ease of its passage in the fear-swamped aftermath of 9/11, is the direct result of public sentiment turning against superheroes in the wake of a tragic confrontation between an upstart, fame-mongering vigilante group known as the New Warriors — they even have their own Big Brother-style reality show — and a gang of super-villains that spilled over into the streets, leading to the deaths of over 600 civilians, 60 of them children.
The issue sharply divides the superhero community. Iron Man’s pro-registration camp boasts Reed Richards, the elastic-limbed leader of the Fantastic Four, and Hank Pym, better known as the original Ant-Man, while Cap’s anti-registration side includes his loyal sidekick-turned-partner Falcon, skillfully played by Anthony Mackie in last spring’s The Winter Soldier, and Luke Cage, a black hero who receives scorn from the pro-registration crowd after comparing the law to slavery. When diplomacy inevitably fails, the two sides come to blows, resulting in several major shake-ups in Marvel’s status quo, with continuity aftershocks that can still be felt nearly a decade later, including the political ascendance of Norman Osborn, a.k.a. the Green Goblin, who uses the in-fighting as an excuse to consolidate power in ways that would make Dick Cheney’s pacemaker skip a beat.
An ideological clash between two of Marvel’s most popular characters might sound like money in the bank, but there are more than a few obstacles standing in the way of a fully-realized Civil War movie. First and foremost, it seems way too early for this particular storyline. The Avengers have only been a team for around three years. Is it really time to break them up already? Will Captain America 3 tell the whole story, or will the bulk of the drama be reserved for a later date, maybe just in time for The Avengers 3 in 2018?
Then there’s the issue of the Superhuman Registration Act itself. With the exception of some of the characters on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., very few heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe are dependent on hidden identities. If you take away the right-to-secrecy underpinnings, the social commentary behind the law and the debate surrounding it loses a lot of its satiric bite.
I mean, think about it: Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is always the first to inform people he’s an Asgardian prince. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are already government operatives, so the law wouldn’t affect them. The name Steve Rogers is plastered all over a Captain America Smithsonian exhibit in The Winter Soldier. Any New Yorker with a smart phone could have caught Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) hulking out during the climax of The Avengers. Hell, Tony Stark couldn’t even make it through one movie without outing himself as Iron Man — at a crowded press conference, no less — and Iron Man 3 had the goateed technocrat giving out his home address to the media as part of an ill-advised attempt to draw the Mandarin out of hiding. All these observations add up to one inescapable conclusion: none of these guys seem overly concerned about privacy, so why would they suddenly be willing to fight and die over it?
There’s also Millar’s borderline-villainous characterization of Iron Man to consider. As the story unfolds, Stark becomes increasingly fanatical when it comes to enforcing the law, even going so far as to send his fellow superheroes to a specially-designed prison in the Negative Zone — a parallel universe made up entirely of antimatter — if they refuse to register. Even though Downey has expressed an interest in exploring Stark’s dark side in the past, specifically the alcoholism-centric “Demon in a Bottle” storyline, it’s difficult to imagine Marvel allowing their flagship character to be remolded into a jackbooted autocrat. Besides, Downey’s Stark doesn’t seem like he trusts the government enough to become its willing puppet. In The Avengers, he was on the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier less than 10 minutes before he started hacking their system to learn more about their weapons programs.
The biggest challenge facing a potential Civil War movie is the ever-present specter of usage rights. Many of the story’s most pivotal players, including Stark’s ally Reed Richards and the ostensibly neutral X-Men, are not owned by Marvel. The rights to both the X-Men and the Fantastic Four are currently held by Fox, and Marvel has recently taken steps to avoid giving their longtime rival any help in the creative department, forbidding their writers to create any new X-Men mutants and cancelling the beloved Fantastic Four comic, despite the fact that Marvel’s “First Family” is about to celebrate its 75th anniversary.
The character whose absence would be perhaps the most glaring and deeply felt is Spider-Man, who serves as the audience surrogate for much of Civil War. His involvement in the Superhuman Registration Act feud begins when Stark convinces the web-head to reveal himself as Peter Parker on live TV, which strikes an important early blow against the anti-registration movement. When he finds out about the Negative Zone prison, however, Spidey realizes he’s chosen the wrong side and attempts to reach out to Cap and his underground resistance fighters, setting the stage for a truly grand finale. Simply put: To remove Spider-Man from Civil War is to rob Millar’s narrative of its moral center.
All is not lost, however. There have been rumblings, vague but persistent, that Sony Pictures, the current rights holder to Spider-Man on film, is meeting with Disney and Marvel to discuss the possibility of allowing the wall-crawler to scuttle into the Marvel Cinematic Universe for a no-doubt sizable movie-by-movie fee, specifically within the forthcoming Phase Three docket of films, which is set to include, by sheer coincidence, both Captain America 3 and The Avengers 3.
If Sony is truly interested in sharing Spidey for a storyline this epic, it’s fair to say the fan response would be nothing short of rapturous. In fact, if all goes well, we could very well be looking at the first Civil War to actually bring people together.

Life in suburbia can be uneventful. White Bird in a Blizzard spends a lot of time at the heart of 1980s suburbia with very little going on, and a little time with a lot happening -— namely, at the very end. Things almost occur, you are led to expect them, and then they don’t. Director Gregg Araki takes great joy in bringing each scene to the brink of revelation — or violence — before drawing it back into an uneasy serenity. He does this often, making this rather slow film suspenseful enough to keep you interested.
Youth in revolt · Shailene Woodley’s Kat plays the archetype of a rebellious teen while dealing with the disappearance of her mother. – Photo courtesy of Magnolia Pictures
Because there’s much more here than just the story, which follows Kat (Shailene Woodley), a teenager in the late 80s recently transitioned into a swan of a young woman after years of being a chubby duckling. Woodley, accustomed to angst-ridden high school roles by now, perfectly captures Kat’s combination of insecurity and budding sexual prowess. And as she comes into the full bloom of youth, her mother Eve (Eva Green) descends into jealous madness — at one point Eve hawkishly watches Kat apply makeup and notes, “You look like I looked when I was your age.” The film opens with Kat finding her mother asleep on her bed, deliriously checked out at 5 p.m., and only a few days later, she has disappeared without a trace. The moments we meet her are in flashbacks relayed to Kat’s therapist (Angela Bassett), who has the responsibility of unraveling the teenager’s apparent indifference to her unstable mother’s disappearance.
And then, not much happens. Kat doesn’t go on a perilous journey to find her — rather, she listens to Depeche Mode and discusses her sexual exploits with her outcast friends, played by Gabourey Sidibe and Mark Indelicato. She’s much more interested in the newfound sexual disinterest of her boyfriend (Shiloh Fernandez) than her mother’s disappearance. In one scene she pretends to have new evidence as an excuse to seduce the detective (Thomas Jane) assigned to the case. The only indication we get that she’s even thinking about her mother is in strange dreams Kat has, in which she is in an all-white blizzard and finds her mom buried under the snow.
White Bird isn’t all that interested in criminal procedures or detective work — it’s much too occupied  with unraveling the complicated and dysfunctional relationships of this suburban family. The highlights of this film are the interactions among the characters, including Kat’s subtle discomfort around her awkward father Brock (a mustachioed and disarming Christopher Meloni) and her quiet seduction of the muscular male archetype that is Detective Scieziesciez. The greatest scenes revolve around the interactions of the family, such as Eve’s silent fury when told to pass the butter and the disgust with which she looks at her inept husband. The juxtaposition of Green’s campy, over-the-top performance — perfectly embellished by the streaks of mascara under her eyes — to her daughter and husband’s subdued naturalness are both hilarious and strangely poignant. This is a woman who’s lost touch, who doesn’t even seem to realize what decade she’s in, demonstrated by her perfectly coifed 1960s housewife wardrobe in 1988.
The conversations between Eve and anyone else are so absurd, so awkward, that it’s difficult not to laugh out of discomfort. Meanwhile,     sad-eyed Meloni gives the film a sensitive touch -— compared to Kat’s unfeeling, unaffected Winona Ryder-like persona, Brock is a vulnerable pushover, eager to please and befuddled at his wife’s disappearance. Meloni, known primarily for Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, gives this mystery plot a character with some unique quirks. The film rides on the strength of its performers, who all imbue their characters with hints of absurdity to match the dreamlike quality here. Araki inscribes a Twin Peaks, Lynchian mood to the film in its haunting, dreamy progression, capped off with Laura Palmer herself (Twin Peaks actress Sheryl Lee) making a quick appearance.
So even if the film doesn’t have much plot to cover, it has plenty of people to examine, and it creates a special landscape to do so in. Shag carpets, yellowish lighting and a cozy basement den with an ugly couch complete this dull suburban home that’s slowly driven Eve into alcoholism and loathing. The Cure, Depeche Mode and Joy Division posters adorn Kat’s bedroom, where she dons denim jackets stitched with badges. Araki pays minute attention to detail from start to finish, creating a setting that’s so complex, we don’t mind if very little happens within it.
By the time the film reaches its final stages, the suspense of this inertia has built up to high levels of anticipation, and Araki stretches it out as long as he can. He’s intent on surprising here- — after keeping the viewer on his toes the entire film, the final reveal is as ridiculous, yet fitting, as can be hoped for.

On the evening of Oct. 22, Trojans for Israel (TFI) — the USC student group dedicated to spreading awareness of the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship — hosted its annual dinner gala. This year’s event was dedicated to creating a dialogue about American-Israeli partnerships and research on keeping servicemen healthy and emotionally stable on and off the battlefield.
The United States and Israel routinely hold joint training exercises, so each country can learn and benefit from the advancements of the other. The conversation at TFI’s event was aimed at demonstrating the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship not only for the training, but also for researching and furthering medical and support opportunities to ensure mental health after battlefield experience. Judah Joseph, TFI’s President, noted that, “The relationship is far more than a strategic and economic relationship — this relationship will reap rewards that will touch and benefit soldiers across the world, no matter their nationality or creed.”
Keynoting the event were Col. Dr. Eyal Fruchter, an Israeli national and visiting professor to the USC School of Social Work, and Michael Johnson, President of the USC Veterans Association. The two, who both have experience on the battlefield, agreed upon the critical importance of the work being done to ensure soldiers’ mental health, especially after they return to civilian life. Fruchter, the former head of the Mental Health Division in the Israeli Medical Corps, is spending his year at USC researching post-traumatic stress disorder, mental health resiliency and leadership.
The topic of veterans’ care is one with a specific resonance for USC: in 2009, USC became the first major research institution to offer a military social work specialization. Because of the importance of this work, the USC School of Social Work has already made an international, multi-faceted approach to the issues concerning mental health in the military. The School of Social Work has teamed up with international colleagues, including those from the United Kingdom, Canada and Israel. Bringing Fruchter to USC underlines the importance of the work done for the benefit of servicemen across the world.
Though American and Israeli soldiers wear different uniforms, the problems they both face are universal. Michael Johnson highlighted this key point while speaking about the PTSD he sees in his fellow servicemen.
In this politically-charged climate, it is often easy to forget that Israel is more than just a player in Middle Eastern politics. Its technical and medical innovations have had practical, long-term results for people all over the world, including here in the United States. When energies are focused at working together rather than dividing, real work with long-term implications can be accomplished. Improving the wellness of servicemen everywhere goes beyond political strife.
When the American Studies Association — an American organization dedicated to the study of American history and culture — decided to boycott Israel’s academic institutions, the American Psychological Association responded by unequivocally stating, “Any attack on institutions of higher learning and individual scientists, academics, and researchers based on political policy halts academic freedoms and negatively affects the vital role research plays for our patients and profession.”
The crucial work being done by Dr. Fruchter is merely one example of the benefits of a strong relationship between Israel and the United States. Because this relationship is strong enough to create opportunities such as his residence here, we all can reap the rewards. As another attendee, sophomore sociology major Tiffany Yadegar, noted, “Coming to this dinner really convinced me of the importance of maintaining the U.S.-Israeli relationship.”

If you want to see a BDS supporter squirm, ask them why
Israel existing as a
Jewish state is unacceptable and racist but Palestine
existing as an Arab and
Muslim state is a noble cause worth supporting.
My proof of this is examples of the Palestinian National
Charter:
“Article 1. Palestine is the homeland of the Arab
Palestinian people;
it is an indivisible part of the greater Arab homeland, and
the Palestinian
people are an integral part of the Arab nation.”
And from the basic law of Palestine:
“Islam is the official religion in Palestine.”
So why isn’t there a movement to boycott the Palestinians,
seeing as how they
make it clear they intend to make a theocratic, ethnic-based
state?
“Israel’s unique
achievements in the area of health care were underscored in the Forbes
June 2014 list of 10 health tech companies changing the world. Five of them
were Israeli.
“It’s amazing that Israel — a country of only 8 million people — produces so
many leading health technology companies,” David E. Williams, president of the
U.S.-based Health Business Group, told the Grapevine. According to Williams,
“Israel’s highly educated technical and medical workers are reared in a society
that prizes problem-solving and innovation, placing tremendous value on curing
illness and saving lives.”

The media magicians have pulled their greatest switcheroo yet: convincing the nation to care more about the Ebola virus than violations of basic human rights happening in Detroit. The following is intended to reverse that trend.
Marissa Renteria | Daily Trojan
 
You read that right, by the way: Detroit. Not Baghdad, Kabul, Damascus or Guantanamo. Detroit, Michigan — an American city that is now in the business of denying poor people their fundamental right to drinking water. The good folks in TV land are reporting on a virus that has killed fewer Americans than Kim Kardashian has had husbands, and it has regrettably distracted citizens from events like the World Series or the midterm elections, which might be excusable. But this isn’t.
Here are the facts: In July, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department began shutting off water supply for thousands of people with unpaid or underpaid bills, despite the efforts to gradually pay off their outstanding debt. The shutoffs began happening when Detroit’s water company started discussing a possible shift from public to private hands to save the city from bankruptcy, but the profit-over-people mentality quickly began ruining lives, and as of today, nearly 10,000 households in the city don’t have running water. In July, the community reached out to the United Nations (yes, the actual United Nations), which quickly condemned the actions and sent two officials to hear testimony in Detroit this week, who were “shocked, impressed by the proportions of the disconnections and by the way that it is affecting the weakest, the poorest and the most vulnerable.”
Let’s also not forget that 80 percent of Detroit’s population is African-American, which possibly qualifies the water disaster as discrimination under international law. Even worse, when residents sued the city, bankruptcy judge Steven Rhodes threw the case out and ruled that there was no “enforceable right” to clean drinking water. Residents who don’t have water now rely on groups like We the People of Detroit, which describes itself as a grassroots organization that delivers buckets of water through its “Water Board Coalition” to the families experiencing a shutoff. Meanwhile, though residents have seen their water shut off for outstanding debts, organizations like the Detroit Red Wings hockey team and the Lions football team haven’t lost a single drop despite having racked up thousands in debt.
One school in Detroit is even opening at 5 a.m. so its students can shower. Little kids can’t complain to teachers about water shutoffs, though, because the teachers would be legally required to report it to child protective services, which could then remove the children from their parents because of “neglect.”
Let’s get this straight: Citizens of the United States of America are being forced to endure third-world conditions, and the United Nations is conducting an investigation to get to the bottom of it. People are having their water delivered to them in the same way we deliver food aid to North Korea or Pakistan. They are the poorest of the poor, they are non-white, and they need and deserve our voices. Why aren’t they getting them?
Detroit needs two things: In the short term, the federal government should declare a state of emergency and immediately appropriate funds to bring water relief to the people. In the long term, Detroit’s water distribution should stay in public hands, which a white paper published by Corporate Accountability International (CAI) says will decrease water prices. In addition, the U.S. policy of uniform unit water pricing (where everyone pays the same) should be revisited in Detroit. It’s an abomination that the Detroit Lions football team pays the same rate for water that poor folks below the poverty line do, purely because it is a commercial rather than residential user. The proposal to charge the Lions, Redwings and other entities more for water should not be confused with suggesting that rich people should pay more for water, but rather to suggest that those who consume more of a scarce resource should have to pay more for it to offset the crushing burden that is faced by people who need comparatively little water, but need water nonetheless.
Unfortunately, none of that will happen. The media and midterm-obsessed politicians in this country have decided that a U.N. investigation in America’s living room is, shockingly, not going to be their politically sexy cause célèbre. That’s where we come in.
In late July and August, the Ice Bucket Challenge made waves in this country as a social media trend where people filmed themselves dumping ice water on their heads to raise funds and awareness for those afflicted by Lou Gehrig’s disease, or ALS. If a campaign like that can raise over $100 million and a Kickstarter request for potato salad ingredients can make $55,000, the armchair activists around this country can do something for Detroit.
So wake up USC, college students and bloggers around the country: It only takes one creative Facebooker or YouTuber to get people to care about these poor folks. This, like Kony 2012, the Occupy Movement and the Ice Bucket Challenge can and should be the next cause that the citizens of this great nation take up. Not only because they can, but also because it is too important a matter to be left to the politicians and media to get right.

Statement from Mayor Mike Duggan on Unanimous Approval of Regional Water Authority
10/10/2014 – “Yesterday, 40 years of division over control of our regional water and sewer system has ended.  The fact that the legislative bodies of the City of Detroit and all three counties have approved the creation of the Great Lakes Regional Water Authority shows the new sense of cooperation and partnership that exists between our city and its suburban neighbors.  
Each partner recognized the fundamental fairness of this plan and its benefits to customers across the region, particularly the establishment of a dedicated $4.5 million water affordability fund for those struggling to pay their bills.  Once the new Authority is in place early next year, the city will begin moving forward with its plan to put Detroiters to work rebuilding our crumbling water mains.”

STATEMENT FROM MAYOR DUGGAN ON BEING GIVEN AUTHORITY OVER DWSD:
I welcome the Emergency Manager’s order this morning giving me the responsibility for dealing with the Water Department issues. We need to change a number of things in the way we have approached the delinquent payment issues and I expect us to have a new plan shortly. There are funds available to support those who cannot afford their bills – we need to do a much better job in community outreach to tell our residents how to access those funds.
I’ve heard complaints from many Detroiters who are trying to make payment arrangements, but who have faced long waits on the telephone or long lines at the DWSD offices. We’ve got to do a much better job of supporting those who are trying to do the right thing in making those payment arrangements.
Last night, I met with DWSD leadership and we’ll be developing plans together to fix these problems.
But it is important to remember that in the water system, each city is its own separate legal fund. When some Detroit residents don’t pay their bills, those bills have to be paid by other Detroiters. There is no outside funding from the suburbs, from the state, or from the feds. These unpaid water bills are Detroit’s alone.
So all bills that remain uncollected this year must be paid for by higher rates on all Detroiters next year.
We will be developing a plan that allows those who are truly needy to access financial help and allows those who want to make payment arrangements to do so with shorter wait times. 
As for those who can pay and choose not to, we won’t force other Detroiters to pay their bills.
