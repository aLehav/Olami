Though interim head coach Ed Orgeron has coached many games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the spotlight has never truly been on him. That’ll change Thursday night.
After practice on Tuesday during the last media session of the week, Daily Trojan staff writer Darian Nourian was there to see what “Coach O” is thinking ahead of his  head coaching debut at USC.
 
DT: Do you have any kind of speech planned for before Thursday night’s game?
Coach O: We’ve been preparing for this all week but come Thursday night when we get in the Coliseum, they’re going to be ready to go, but I’m sure I will have a couple of words to tell ’em.
 
DT: You’re making your debut as interim head coach, are you nervous at all or have any exciting jitters?
Coach O: I guess come Thursday I will be a little fired up. I don’t know about nervous though; I will be fired up.
 
DT: Have you planned how the game is going to go on the sidelines?
Coach O: I think we are going to have to work it out as we go, but I really think it is going to help having Clay Helton on the sideline managing the offense, and me right there helping him talking about the offense. … I’m really going to be there to encourage, show enthusiasm and keep things going on.
 
DT: What have you learned about game management and time management since the last time you had to do that as a head coach?
Coach O: Make good, sound decisions, not emotional decisions. The last time that I was a head coach [at Ole Miss], I made a couple emotional decisions and it cost me. One time, I went for it on 4th and two when I shouldn’t have, and if I wasn’t as emotional, I would’ve made a better decision and I’ve learned from that.
 
DT: One of the things that Lane [Kiffin] had talked about for the past couple of years was whether he was focusing too much on the offense instead of being a head coach. Is that something you are going to be fighting or thinking about?
Coach O: Not really … I’m going to do what I do best … coach toughness, style and energy throughout the whole game with the whole team. … I will be [with] the whole team as much as I can and we are going to give it everything we got. …  I plan on coaching the whole team and I’m going to be on the sideline. … Ross Cummins will go with [the defensive line] and him and Clancy [Pendergast] will make the proper adjustments.
 
DT: Do you remember where to stand as a head coach?
Coach O: Oh yeah, right in the middle of everybody. I will be fine. … I feel at home at the Coliseum. I’ve been there since 1998, and I know that it’s going to be a little bit different, but ever since I came to Los Angeles, I’ve felt at home. … I promise you this … I’m going to feel good being a head coach in cardinal and gold.

Daily Trojan sports editor Will Laws interviewed James Kelley and Megan Coghlan, the co-sports editors of the Daily Wildcat, earlier this week to give USC fans a better feel for the Wildcats ahead of Thursday’s showdown at the Coliseum.
 
DT: It’ll be a battle of strengths this weekend with Ka’Deem Carey and the U of A rushing game (291.5 yards per game, 10th in nation) versus USC’s rush defense (99.6 YPG, 13th in nation). Who do you think comes out on top?
James Kelley: Arizona’s run game will have the advantage over USC’s powerful rush defense. The Wildcats are one-dimensional on offense, but their running game is very diverse. Carey is the face of the running game and is fifth in the country in rushing yards per game, but quarterback B.J. Denker is eighth in the Pac-12 in rushing and running back Daniel Jenkins is 11th. Denker runs more like a running back than a quarterback and Jenkins is speedier than Carey and provides a change of pace.
 
DT: If USC’s rush defense does force Arizona to rely on B.J. Denker’s arm, does he have the ability to pick apart the Trojans’ secondary?
Kelley: B.J. Denker hasn’t shown the ability to make teams consider him a threat yet. Denker is 122nd in passing in the NCAA, with 445 yards in four games and 114th in passing efficiency. Those numbers by themselves are bad, but even more frightening when you consider UA’s opponents. The Wildcats played Northern Arizona (an FCS team), UNLV (who lost to NAU last year) and UTSA (a team in its third year of existence) to open the season. Now that he is facing Pac-12 defenses, Denker’s numbers should fall even more.
 
DT: How have the Wildcats been able to keep opponents from doing much damage on defense (14.3 points/game, 9th in nation)?
Megan Coghlan: The Wildcat defense has certainly stepped up its performance from last year, after being 118th out of 120. Big defenders like Tra’Mayne Bondurant and freshman Scooby Wright have stood out as surprise leaders. Bondurant has accounted for three of the seven total interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns. Wright leads with 28 tackles. It is worth noting, though, that Arizona has only had one tough game, which was Washington. Tonight’s game will provide a clearer answer.
 
DT: Do you think that’s been a result of Arizona’s weak opening schedule, or can the Wildcats stuff the Trojans’ passing game?
Kelley: Much of Arizona’s impressive start to the season on the defensive side of the ball was due to the schedule, but they do in fact look better than last year. Last year they had some injuries, and those players returning along with some talented newcomers like Wright have added depth. They aren’t stuck in the base defense all the time anymore and have unveiled a “SWAT defense” that is designed for third down passing situations. Even if Marqise Lee doesn’t play, Arizona’s secondary had to have nightmares about last year’s game, so they will be very motivated.
 
DT: How do you see tonight’s showdown shaking out?
Coghlan: You could determine this game by dissecting the offenses, the defenses, the quarterbacks and statistics, but I think the true nature of this game is going to come down to the current conditions of each team. USC has seen better days, which could either fuel the fire or leave the Trojans in shambles. I do know that when Arizona fired its head coach Mike Stoops two years ago, the proceeding game showed a pumped-up Wildcat team and ended in success against UCLA. USC also has home-field advantage, but the Wildcats are still undoubtedly hungry for a win, so it will be a close one.
Prediction: 35-31 Arizona

After defeating No. 9-ranked UC Irvine 18-7 last Saturday to start the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation schedule undefeated, the No. 2-ranked Trojans head south to play in the SoCal Tournament hosted by the Anteaters. The Trojans look to avenge their NorCal title game defeat at the hands of UCLA by winning their 10th SoCal crown in past 11 years.
Reload · Redshirt sophomore two-meter Russell Renteria has netted 12 goals for the Trojans this season while scoring in 10 different matches, but was held scoreless in the team’s 9-8 loss to UCLA. –
If USC (13-1) is able to win it all, they would most likely regain their No. 1 ranking that had been with them since 2011 before the Bruins stripped them of it. Ever since losing to UCLA, the team has had a three-game winning streak and won each of those games by an average of almost 17 goals.
“It has definitely put a little fire in our bellies,” said senior two-meter Connor Virjee.
The SoCal Tournament features top-notch competition from across the nation with 16 of the nation’s top teams participating, including all nine MPSF teams, so USC is looking to make a splash not only nationally, but also within their own conference.
The majority of the 16-team field is from California, with the exception being St. Francis Brooklyn, who is making the cross-country trip from New York. Non-MPSF teams participating include teams that USC has already handily beaten such as Loyola Marymount, Pomona-Pitzer and UC San Diego.
“SoCal is always filled with good games and I’m looking forward to the healthy competition,” Virjee said.
The Trojans will open up the tournament against No. 16-ranked St. Francis Brooklyn in an 8 a.m. match on Saturday at Corona del Mar High School. Should they notch a win against the Terriers, they will then face the winner of the morning’s No. 7 Long Beach State vs. No. 10 Loyola Marymount game at 2 p.m. With another win there, they will move onto the semifinals on Sunday at UC Irvine.
Last year, the Trojans started off on a high note against St. Francis Brooklyn, defeating them 15-4 before going on to take down Pacific 9-4 to move on to the semifinals. Once there, the Trojans defeated UC Irvine 10-5 before taking home the tournament title with a 14-5 win over UC Santa Barbara.
This weekend, the team will have to focus on retaining solid defense for all four quarters, regardless of the score.
“This week, we have really been working on how we are going to defend each of out opponents,” senior driver Kostas Genidounias said. “We have some games that we start really well like against UC Irvine and then we lose our focus and allow easy goals on defense so we are definitely going to work on maintaining our focus for the entire game.”
This weekend could also be a milestone for senior Nikola Vavic, who enters the tourney just six goals away from becoming USC’s all-time top scorer. He entered the 2013 season ranked No. 4 all-time in school history, but in just 14 games of work, has netted 42 goals to give him 215 career goals.
Vavic looks to surpass Juraj Zatovic’s 220 goal mark that he achieved in his four years at USC.
“Nikola knows how to put the ball in the cage, but sooner or later, he will [break the record],“ Genidounias said.
A strong performance and a tournament title will give the Trojans a good amount of momentum heading into the rest of MPSF play.
“We’re going to go into this tournament really focused on winning all of our games so that we can get that groove going,” Genidounias said.
They return home to the Uytengsu Aquatics Center the following weekend (Oct. 19) to take on non-MPSF opponents Loyola Marymount and Cal Lutheran.

Not even halfway through her senior season, Natalie Hagglund is already fast approaching USC’s all-time women’s volleyball records. As the starting libero for the Women of Troy for four seasons, she has been the constant as the team has gone through waves of success and disappointment.
Team player · Senior libero Natalie Hagglund’s teammates said she acts as a calming presence, even in tense moments on the court. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
But then, Natalie Hagglund is no stranger to riding waves.
Growing up in Encinitas, Calif., Hagglund has been paddling out and catching waves off the California coast almost all of her life. Though she surfed competitively — Hagglund won a county competition in middle school and was a member of the La Costa Canyon High School team — she never lost the peaceful sensation of being out on the board, alone with the waves. This freedom from anxiety has carried both her and her team through tight situations throughout her career.
“I think competing in surfing was big for me and my calmness,” Hagglund said of her relaxing presence on the court. “It kind of triggers your inner self. It’s a single sport so you have to be able to bring calmness to yourself.”
Her teammates have certainly noticed her presence on the court, and look to her often in high-pressure situations and during times when things appear bleak.
“I know that every time when I’m on the court and she’s on the court, I’ll look back at her first after somebody scores,” senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard said. “She’s the focal point of our team, the one who I put my trust in. She’s incredible to play with. She brings energy, she brings intensity.”
USC head coach Mick Haley appreciates Hagglund’s presence and her ability to be the glue of the team both on and off the court.
“We have a catalyst in Hagglund,” Haley said. “She’s the one that unifies everyone. We have a lot of people who have bought into that and follow her in that regard. She directs the energy in practice and our gym culture is what it is because Natalie brings it every day.”
Her ability to keep her cool yet still bring an intensity to the court seem at odds with one another, but Hagglund has found a special balance that allows them to work together for the good of the team. Of course, she’s been doing this volleyball thing for quite a while, too.
Fittingly, Hagglund started her career on the sand, becoming a state beach champion in the U-14 division in 2005. She went on to win a national championship in Junior Olympics beach volleyball in the U-16 division. Her indoor club team, the Encinitas Wave, also won a Junior Olympics championship in the U-16 division. Even before high school, success seemed to follow Hagglund wherever she went.
Once she did reach the prep ranks, she became a decorated star on the court. She earned first-team All-CIF San Diego Section honors in 2007, and by her senior year had earned first team All-American honors. Upon graduating, she was ranked as the nation’s top libero by Prep Volleyball. Despite her commitments to the school volleyball and surf teams, she was also able to continue her sand career throughout high school, and in 2009 was part of the youngest team ever to qualify for the AVP Manhattan Beach Open.
The key to her success? Hagglund is unrivaled in her desire to compete, a desire that has given her many opportunities to win titles and overcome stressful games.
“I’ve been competitive my whole life, and I’ve been playing volleyball and competing in volleyball forever,” Hagglund said. “I’ve gotten to play with the USA national team and have gotten to go to Peru where there are 15,000 people screaming at you, so I’ve learned to play through certain adversities.”
Hagglund’s college career seemed destined for greatness from the beginning, as she collected nine digs and one assist in her collegiate debut against Loyola Marymount, a match the Women of Troy swept. She would go on to start every game that season as USC’s starting libero, and was given a spot on the Pac-10 All-Freshman Team.
A sophomore slump was not in the cards for Hagglund, as she became the first USC libero ever to be named to the AVCA All-America first team. Not surprisingly, she was also named Pac-12 Conference Libero of the Year.
Coming off of a near-perfect season, Hagglund remarkably was able to improve upon her success in her junior year. Her 613 digs were good enough to put her third all-time on USC’s single season list, and she moved into second all-time at USC in career digs. Once again she received a selection to the AVCA All-America first team, and was named Pac-12 Libero of the Year.
Though it’s clear to see accolades have never eluded her, Hagglund is still searching for the one thing that eludes her on the court. When asked what the perfect ending to her USC career would be, there was no hesitation: She wants to win a national championship.
“I’ve been thinking about it since my freshman year,” she said. “I’ve been to the Final Four my freshman and sophomore year and just missed it last year, so winning with this group of girls would be the most amazing finish. For me it has nothing to do with me ending with my best career finish statistically or awards. Honestly I just want that ring; I want to be able to wear that championship hat with pride at the beach. I want that memory with these girls, to accomplish something that great with my favorite people.”
She is certainly off to a great start this season, leading USC to a 14-1 start, including a 4-0 Pac-12 record. If things continue as they have been for the Women of Troy, Hagglund might yet be able to attain that final goal, a championship ring that would look awfully good gleaming in the light as she paddles out into the sunset of her career.

Exactly six weeks ago, I wrote a column that my editors headlined “First game couldn’t arrive sooner for USC.” It was Aug. 29, the day of the Trojans’ season opener against Hawai’i. The gist, more or less, was this: “This is a team, a fan base and a program all too eager for a fresh start.” Football was back. Last season was over. And everyone was ready for it.
It might be only six weeks later, but let me just say: This is a team, a fan base and a program all too eager for a fresh start once again.
“It feels like a whole new team,” sophomore defensive lineman Leonard Williams said. “It feels like we’re just coming into a new season right now.”
And that is exactly what this seems like. In a strange way, tonight’s game feels more like a “first game” than even the actual first game did. Interim head coach Ed Orgeron even referred to tonight’s matchup as “our first game together,” despite the fact that this is exactly the same group of players and assistant coaches that toiled through the first five games.
“We’re treating everything now as if we’re 0-0,” redshirt junior cornerback Josh Shaw said on Monday. “It’s definitely a fresh start. There’s a lot of new energy around here. Everyone’s excited and we just can’t wait for Thursday.”
Apart from Shaw stealing my “fresh start” line, they key word there is “energy.” That and “fun” have become the two buzzwords to describe the Orgeron regime at USC, thanks in no small part to the coach himself.
“I think [the team is] in a really good place,” Orgeron said. “Just walking into the meeting room, I can feel the energy. They’re smiling, they’re loving practice, they’re practicing very hard. I want them to fight, and compete, and play with energy, and have fun playing the game.”
There you go, “energy” and “fun,” just two words apart. Now here’s Williams again:
“[Coach] is really just trying to have everyone come together as a team,” Williams said. “Just come out with a lot of energy, and make sure everybody’s having fun. And by him doing that, people actually want to come out here, and have fun and compete.”
Energy! Fun! Fun again! And you know what: It’s true. There is a vibe around the USC football program that is very different than in years past. To call it a Pete Carroll-era swagger would be too much, but there is a sort of enthusiastic confidence that emanates from the players and the staff.
Here are just a few quips from players on the new vibe at practices.
Williams: “Coach O brings a lot of energy to the table. Since day one [of] practice, he’s told us he just wants a lot of energy, no holding back. Just come out, compete and have fun — that’s what he wants us to do.”
Shaw: “We love it. [Orgeron] brings a lot of energy and we feed off him. The practice has been different, our meetings have been different. Everything as far as energy is up about 10 times.”
Redshirt junior defensive lineman George Uko: “He brings more nastiness to the team. You’ve seen it with the defensive line [which Orgeron coached before being promoted], we’re some of the nastier players on the team. And I think he’s brings that mentality along to the whole team.”
And finally, redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler: “I feel a lot more focused in the sense that you want to be perfect on every play. You don’t want to mess up because you don’t want Coach O yelling at you. Obviously when you get new leadership on the team, there’s gonna be a different attitude — but I like our mindset. I like where our team is at and I like where everyone’s head is at.”
All of them say more or less the same thing, and they all genuinely feel that. It’s impossible not to. This is, save for one man, the exact same team. It’s probably actually a lesser team than before, with junior wide receiver Marqise Lee and senior defensive lineman Morgan Breslin likely out tonight. But there’s no denying it: This team is different.
In practices led by former head coach Lane Kiffin toward the end of last year, players often looked like they were just going through the motions (sort of like the games — imagine that). The media did not get to see any Kiffin-led practices this season, but it’s fair to assume they weren’t much different.
Under Kiffin, the gist of his practice report was execution: how the day went from a strictly schematic perspective, which made sense coming from an Xs and Os-type coach. But under Orgeron, it’s all about the vibe and mentality of the team.
Case in point: Orgeron’s decision to eliminate the yellow non-contact jerseys that quarterbacks wore. Quarterbacks wearing non-contact jerseys in practice is not a Lane Kiffin thing. It’s a football thing, done with every NFL team and at almost every college in the nation, as well as a good bit of high schools. But that’s just Coach O for you.
“Our colors, the last time I checked, were cardinal and gold,” Orgeron said. “We wear cardinal jerseys and we wear white jerseys. Those are our colors; one team, one heartbeat.”
The Trojans are truly becoming a team under Orgeron. They were in title before, but now they appear to be in spirit, too.
“That’s what’s awesome about Coach O, that he can take something as little as the color of your jersey and make it a team thing,” Kessler said. “He said, ‘You guys weren’t the same color as the rest of the offense, and you have to be the same team and the same color because you’re all one unit.’ To get you pumped up about a jersey color is extremely cool.”
That might sound mundane and frankly stupid to care about, but truthfully those little things matter. Last night, instead of arriving at the hotel in the afternoon, heading into meetings all evening, and then slogging through more meetings all day today, Orgeron took the team to a movie.
“I don’t know what [movie],” Orgeron said on Tuesday. “I’m gonna be on the bus [there], that’s all I know.”
With a night game, Orgeron figured the team might as well take advantage of the extra time earlier in the day, instead of sitting around in the hotel with nothing to do, as was the case before the Washington State game.
“Hopefully we’re energized and ready to play for a late game,” explained Orgeron.
In my column six weeks ago, I said this about Orgeron: “You would be hard-pressed to find a member of the football program, athletic department, or even the Trojan Family, with more ‘Trojan Spirit’ than the man they call Coach O.”
That still rings true. Even before he took charge, Orgeron was the vocal leader of the USC coaching staff, and quite frankly the team as a whole. Nowhere was this more apparent than when he led the Trojans down the tunnel before every game at the Coliseum, something he has no plans to change.
“I’ve done that for years here,” Orgeron said. “It’s really an honor to go down the tunnel. The tradition — to look up on the walls, all the great players there. To hear the cleats go ‘click, clack,’ everyone’s buckled up, all the big guys. I really enjoy it.”
It’s the same players, and the same coaches, in more or less the same roles. But it’s a different team, and it feels like a whole new season starts tonight.

When the Trojans run out of the tunnel to take on the Arizona Wildcats tonight, it’ll be a much different team than the group that took the field for USC’s most recent game 12 days ago.
Embrace · Redshirt sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams (94) and redshirt senior linebacker Devon Kennard (42) celebrate a defensive stop. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Gone is former head coach Lane Kiffin. Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee (knee) and senior linebacker Morgan Breslin (hip), arguably USC’s best offensive and defensive players, respectively, aren’t expected to take the field, either.
Interim head coach Ed Orgeron will lead the Trojans from their locker room down the tunnel in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, past the images of dozens of renowned players and coaches who have established the prestigious tradition associated with USC football.
“It’s really an honor to go down the tunnel,” Orgeron said. “[To see] the tradition, to look up on the wall with all those great players there, hear the cleats go ‘click clack’ … I really enjoy it.”
Those Trojans overcame adversity to have their likenesses enshrined in that tunnel. The question every USC fan wants to know now is: Will Orgeron and his players, who have certainly seen their fair share of hardship this season, follow in those legends’ footsteps by overcoming the Wildcats to restore faith in this year’s squad?
Orgeron, who will complete the first part of his eight-game audition for the USC coaching job against Arizona, is confident they will.
“I’m prepared for this,” Orgeron said. “Obviously we have to go and perform well, but I really feel that they’re gonna perform well and give it their best shot.”
Tonight marks the first non-Thanksgiving Thursday night game in the regular season ever hosted by USC, a quaint storyline that has since taken a backseat to the more pressing issue – can the Trojans inspire belief through their play in Athletic Director Pat Haden that Orgeron can act as a permanent replacement for Kiffin? Or will they come out with another lackluster performance, convincing Haden that USC needs to wipe its hands clean of all aspects of the Kiffin regime?
The players themselves remain confident in Orgeron, who was the Trojans’ emotional leader as defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator even while Kiffin still reigned o’er Troy.
“We really like Coach O, and even the offensive guys like Coach O as the head coach,” sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams said. “It kind of pushes us to play as hard as we can for him to make sure he stays around… We all want Coach O to stay here.”
If the Trojans do want to keep Orgeron at USC, they’ll have to stop Arizona running back Ka’Deem Carey, the unquestioned focal point of the Wildcats’ offense.
Carey led the nation in rushing yards per game (148.4) last season and is ranked fifth (143.7) in the same category this year.
“He’s a very aggressive running back,” Williams said. “If he gets hit, he’s always gonna try to get that extra yard.”
But Carey isn’t the only threat in the Wildcats’ running attack, which ranks second in the Pac-12 (291.5 yards per game) behind only Oregon. Quarterback B.J. Denker has 280 rushing yards and six touchdowns on the ground, and tailback Daniel Jenkins has 252 rushing yards, including a 91-yard touchdown dash.
“Coach O’s really been emphasizing wrapping up this week and working on spin tackles, because we’ve seen on film [Carey] likes to spin out of tackles a lot,” Williams said. “And the quarterback’s a pretty good scrambler as well.”
Arizona’s aerial attack, on the other hand, has been essentially nonexistent. Denker has only completed 50 percent of his attempts while averaging just 111.3 passing yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. Not surprisingly, the Wildcats rank last in the Pac-12 in passing offense.
Arizona’s defense has been surprisingly solid, ranking second in the Pac-12 in scoring defense (14.2 points per game) and fourth in total defense (335.0 yards per game).
But that could be a result of the Wildcats’ exceedingly soft schedule — Arizona defeated Northern Arizona, UNLV and UTSA before being throttled by Washington, 31-13, in their most recent matchup.
Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee would surely like to get a second crack at the Wildcats’ defense after gashing Arizona for 345 receiving yards last year in his signature performance as a Trojan. But Orgeron has not been optimistic about Lee’s chances of suiting up tonight, stating his star receiver as “very questionable” for the showdown against Arizona.
Though one offensive star is expected to sit on the sideline, another will suit up for USC for the first time this season.
Senior running back Silas Redd is expected to make his return against the Wildcats, though junior tailback Tre Madden will continue to start after impressing in Redd’s absence. Freshman tailback Justin Davis will also continue to get touches, and Orgeron even mentioned after practice on Tuesday that he was impressed with fellow freshman back Ty Isaac.
“Ample group of tailbacks that do a good job,” Orgeron said. “We have not discussed a rotation yet but I’m sure all those guys will get some snaps.”
Orgeron has attempted to bring his squad closer by injecting much-needed doses of fun and energy into the program in Kiffin’s wake, adding desserts to the team’s buffet line and taking the team to a movie on Wednesday night ahead of his debut as USC head coach.
“There’s a lot of new energy around here, everybody’s excited and we just can’t wait for Thursday,” redshirt junior cornerback Josh Shaw said. “I think you’re gonna see a lot of guys just flying around and just out there having fun.”
That’s exactly what Orgeron wants to see, and he hopes that the pressure-free atmosphere he’s instituted will translate to better results on the field.
“Obviously there’s probably gonna be some ups and downs that were have to go through,” Orgeron said. “But I want them to fight and compete and play with energy. That I do feel like we’re gonna do well.”
 
You guys are awesome! Fight on!!!

Panelists discussed the importance of the 2012 political race between President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney at this week’s “Students Talk Back, a Public Policy and Politics Forum” hosted by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy’s Schwarzenegger Institute.
The panel was co-moderated by Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute and Annalise Mantz, editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan. Daniel Rothberg, a junior majoring in political science and special projects editor at the Daily Trojan served as a student panelist.
This week’s two guest panelists were Dan Balz, a journalist for the Washington Post and the author of Collision 2012, and Lynn Vavreck, a political science professor at UCLA and co-writer of The Gamble. Balz’s book deals with the campaign strategists’ opinions on the campaign. Vavreck’s book takes a “moneyball” approach to the 2012 election, and attempts to discover what truly affected the campaign results.
“Journalists would say everything matters in the campaign,” Balz said. “Political scientists would say that nothing matters in the campaign.”
Yet both Balz and Vavreck could agree that the economy controls a campaign.
“If I asked you to make a list of the top five moments of 2012, everyone would put the 47 percent video,” Vavreck said. “But the question is, did [the items on that list] change the outcome?”
Vavreck said she doesn’t believe the 47 percent video had an effect on the outcome of the election, but instead thinks that the improving economy gave Obama the advantage he needed to win.
Balz said Romney also agreed with this analysis. Balz  interviewed Romney one-on-one last January.
“His first answer to why he lost is that the economy got better and he could not overcome that,” Balz said.
Balz later said that perhaps the most significant realization he took from his interview with Romney, was an understanding of Romney on a personal level.
“We forget sometimes that [politicians] are human beings,” Balz said. “To see that side of Gov. Romney was an important thing to illuminate in the book.”
Both panelists discussed the use of “big data” in the 2012 campaign and agreed that the Obama campaign commanded the use of statistics.
“[The Obama campaign] developed three different scores: a support score, a turnout score and a persuasion score,” Balz said.
The score showed support for the Democratic Party, the turnout score showed probability at turning up at the polls, and the persuasion score showed how easily someone could be persuaded to support Obama. Using these scores, the campaign developed a powerful targeting system to win swing counties in swing states.
When asked if Romney could have won under a different set of circumstances, Vavreck and Balz had differing opinions.
“My answer is yes,” Vavreck said. “The easiest way for him to do that would be if the economy was different than it was.”
Balz said he did not think Romney could have won, as part of the reason why Romney ultimately lost came from his primary campaign.
“Partially, his message was inconsistent. He allowed himself to go too far to the right,” Balz said.
Many students who attended the discussion found Vavreck’s statistical approach to be interesting.
“Something that really stood out to me was when [Vavreck] talked about was how the women’s reproductive rights [debate] actually had a bigger effect on men than on the women themselves,” said Marisa Tsai, a senior majoring in international relations and global economy.

Thursday’s football game against the University of Arizona Wildcats marks the first non-bowl game to be held on a Thursday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and with it will bring new gameday procedures.
The reason behind the schedule change this year is because USC is required to host a Thursday night game twice every three years as a member of the Pac-12 Conference, USC Associate Athletic Director Jose Eskenazi said.
“It’s a mandated thing from the conference,” Eskenazi said. “It’s obviously not our preference to host a Thursday night game, but we have to do it, and were excited to do it in the sense that we’ll tackle it head-on and hopefully it’ll be a great game experience for all those that attend.”
For the Thursday night game, no on-campus parking for the game or on-campus tailgating will be allowed.
Captain David Carlisle said the university made the decision to ban campus activities to ensure that academics on campus will not be interrupted.
“This being the first Thursday night game ever for USC, it’s going to be a challenge in that there will be no tailgating allowed on campus,” Carlisle said. “That is a decision that the university has made because it is going to be considered a normal academic day.”
Since no on-campus parking will be available to those attending the game, other options will be made available.
“Parking will be available down in L.A. Live and several lots will be open that folks can park there, and there will be a shuttle service to and from the Coliseum,” Eskenazi said.
Tailgating opportunities have also been added at the Galen Center and the Coliseum.
“To make up for the lack of tailgating on campus, the Galen Center will have an open tailgate that you can walk up to and pay to attend, and also the Cardinal and Gold Picnic at the Coliseum has opened up spaces for the general public,” Eskenazi said.
Thursday classes will be held on their regular schedules.
“Some schools cancel classes if they host a weekday football game,” Eskenazi said. “At USC, it was the administration’s decision not to do that. USC is an academic institution first and foremost, so classes are regularly scheduled and all ongoing regular campus activities will go on.”
Both DPS and the Athletic Department have been preparing for months to make sure that the night goes smoothly.
“We’ve been planning this for a good eight to nine months,” Eskenazi said. “It all started with getting all groups on campus together to talk about what the plans should be and what the communications would be, and making sure we adhere to the university policy that classes would still be in session and find alternatives for people to be able to attend the game.”
Gian Johl, a graduate student studying business administration who plans to attend the game, said that his midterm was rescheduled as a result of the football game.
“The class voted to take the midterm early because of logistics,” Johl said.
Ronan Young, a freshman majoring in business administration who regularly attends USC football games, said he thinks the Thursday night date will negatively affect student attendance.
“I feel like the student attendance won’t quite be the same because a lot of people that would say, go on a Saturday because it’s the only thing to do, now have work to do or schoolwork to do, and now they’re going to choose not to go,” Young said.
Sean Lee, an undecided freshman who is choosing not to go to the game, also believes the date will hinder attendance.
“I have the student section tickets, but I’m selling mine because I can’t make it,” Lee said. “I have a 9 a.m. class and a lot of stuff going on Friday.”
Others students, however, said that the usual schedule will not stop them from going to the game.
“I will definitely be attending,” said Paul Samaha, a freshman majoring in public relations. “Most people I know are still going.”
The Athletic Department said they are aware of the effect that the new date could have on game attendance.
“Everyone is used to it being on a Saturday so it’s a change-up from the traditional college football attending experience,” Eskenazi said. “Obviously work and school schedules will affect your ability to attend.”
Nevertheless, the department is excited for this new opportunity.
“It’s the first time we’ve had this sort of ‘week night under the lights’ kind of game,” Eskenazi said. “Coach [Orgeron] is pretty excited about it and he really wants the students’ support, sort of this renewed energy of the team with his leadership. I think it could be a pretty fun deal for students.”

USC’s Undergraduate Student Government will pay its members a collective $239,000 this year, according to a recently released budget addendum accompanied by its set of bylaws.
USG Treasurer Kameron VanWoerkom stated that the levels of student pay were in line with other universities’ student governments, yet USG pay is above average for the Pac-12 and other comparable California universities.
According to USG’s budget addendum, USG will pay $239,071.84 in “student stipends” this year. USG, like many other  student governments, fiscally compensates students. Most Pac-12 schools, however, spend less on student pay than USG. The student government for undergraduates at UC Berkeley, Stanford and UCLA pay their workers $180,343, $79,350, and $44,660, respectively. In fact, of all the Pac-12 schools, USG is paying the most in salaries of any student government, with Cal coming in second at $180,343, nearly $60,000 less than USG. The average amount Pac-12 schools spend on student government is $106,765.
Breaking student government pay down by enrollment also reveals that USC pays itself the most per student. The total student enrollment of USC is 39,958. Stanford has 19,535 students, Berkeley has 35,899 students, and UCLA has 41,341 students. Per student, USG pays itself $5.98. Berkeley pays $5.02, Stanford pays $4.36, and UCLA pays just $1.08. The Pac-12 average is $3.12.
Another way to judge USG salaries is as a ratio of salaries to total budget for student governments. Having more money to manage would increase student representatives’ responsibilities, and therefore would likely require higher salaries. This year, USG has a budget of almost $1.89 million. Berkeley has a budget of $1.64 million, Stanford a budget of $3 million, and UCLA a budget of $5.54 million. The Pac-12 average is $2.03 million. As a percentage of total budget, 13 percent of USG’s budget goes to salaries. Berkeley spends 11 percent on salaries, Stanford 2.7 percent and UCLA 0.8 percent. The average for the Pac-12 is 5.3 percent. USG spends two and a half times as much as the Pac-12 average on salaries, despite having a budget that is less than the Pac-12 average.
The money that USG spends on salaries goes to both elected and appointed members. The highest salary, according to the USG bylaws, goes to USG President Christian Kurth, who will make $10,000 this year. Vice President Ryan Park and Program Board Executive Director Monica Parra will each make $8,000 this year. Thirty-nine other executives, directors, and co-directors make between $2,750 and $6,000 each year. The 12 elected senators will each make $2,000 this year.
Lily Chowana-Bandhu, the interim director of Campus Activities, said that the annual USG budget is sent to the vice provost for Student Affairs for approval. The vice provost and the director of Campus Activities can then make recommendations if they feel that changes need to be made to the budget.
Most of the paid members of USG are not elected. The president and vice president are elected in elections, and senators and assembly directors are elected by their constituencies. The other 29 paid directors are interviewed and then nominated by the chief of staff, senior director of communications, treasurer, president and vice president and then confirmed by the Senate, according to VanWoerkom.
Those non-elected members of USG are paid a total of $128,500 for the year. Elected members of USG collectively make about $74,250 for the year. In addition, student workers who run the front desk of USG and advise USG members on different organizational practices make $36,321.84 in total in hourly wages. The majority of the money spent on students at USG goes to students who are not elected, but rather chosen and confirmed by USG officials.
Each year, there are an unknown number of applicants to the positions. The applicants are interviewed and selected by the five highest-level executives. Only then do the names of the nominees appear, as they are confirmed before the Senate. Normally, the minutes of those confirmations at the Senate level are archived, but at the time of press, no Senate minutes were available for meetings after March 5, 2013. Confirmation hearings happen in late April and it is impossible to determine how much the senators learn about each nominee or question each nominee before voting on confirmation without access to those minutes.
Chowana-Bandhu said one factor that contributes to the amount USG pays its members is the vast time commitment of being in a leadership role.
“An aspect that you would want to consider is that these positions take time away from other opportunities on and off campus. As you may know USC is not cheap and by minimizing the compensation, you are essentially excluding a population of amazing student leaders who may not be in a position to afford this experience. However, too much compensation is not appropriate either,” Chowana-Bandhu said in an email. “The challenge is to find a good balance that is agreed upon and approved by students, Campus Activities and Student Affairs. At this point, there has not been a cause for concern and the leaders in positions with compensation have been working diligently to fulfill their duties.”
USG does not publish a summary of salary information by position. VanWoerkom said that the organization tries not to “easily hand out salary information without engaging in the types of conversations that I’ve had with [the Daily Trojan], working over time, becoming acquainted with the organization, what we do, why we do it, how we do it, [and] where the funds come from.”
Several other Pac-12 schools, including UC Berkeley, Stanford and UCLA, are more transparent about the amount of money they pay their student governments.
“In student government, you are elected to serve the students. Therefore, they deserve to hold you accountable to promises and actions that you take as an elected officer,” said D.J. Payton, a graduate student studying postsecondary administration and student affairs at USC, who also served as the vice president of the student government at the University of Utah last year. “Being transparent about actions and plans, as well as budgetary expenditures, is a fundamental way to maintain the legitimacy and respect between the official and the constituents. … If [transparency is] implemented correctly it can support the [Student Government].”
Kurth declined to comment on USG’s budget or the transparency of the payment process.

It seems the author of this article failed to address one key question:
Rye so serious?
Honestly, USG has done a subpar job for the pay they are getting. If part of their salary went to putting on better events…I hardly think USG leadership is deserving of salaries this high regardless of whether USC has the money or not.
Another key issue is transparency. Why keep it hush hush? Is it coincidence that the higher the salaries, the less transparent it is?
“USG spends two and a half times as much as the Pac-12 average on salaries, despite having a budget that is less than the Pac-12 average.”
This is what is worst. They are doing relatively little for us while getting paid much more than they deserve.
I cash my check at the 9-0
This is disgusting.
Is this an apples to oranges comparison? Does USC have more students involved in USG, therefore having a larger salary budget? Not saying that I agree or disagree with having more or less students, but it would have been helpful to know the number of paid positions at the other Pac-12 schools for a full comparison.
Perhaps the difference in tuition between the schools of the Pac-12 accounts for the increased expenses for USG leadership which could be seen as a form of student aid. Or perhaps the USG leadership at USC is better than all the other Pac-12 schools and therefore, they are worth it.
@Dean, calling USG salaries a “form of student aid” would imply that somehow having an interest in student governance is worth more than having any other interest in a discipline or activity. Should we pay members of USC’s RPL? What about the Robotics Team?
Furthermore financial aid is based on need – presumably members of USG are supported by the existing financial aid system. Presumably USG members want to dedicate their time to representing the student body rather than the incentive of a paycheck. Either way since USG officials don’t publicly disclose tax returns (nor should they) the way members of actual governments do, there’s no way to quantify the barrier to entry or the socioeconomic breakdown of USG officials relative to the student body. 
Also USG’s leadership being better than the other Pac-12 schools would be a hard claim to substantiate. Furthermore doesn’t USG reward themselves enough already with their annual retreat, an estimated expense of $20k?
Students should take an interest in what USG does, as it affects them a heckuva lot more than the actions of random student orgs. 
It’s not random student orgs that host the giant concerts that thousands of students go to, (Springfest, Conquest, Welcome Back) , they’re not the ones bringing speakers in, (Maher, The Great Zamperini, DeGrasse Tyson, Seth Meyers), and they’re not the ones representing the huge diversity of students on campus (Latin@ Student Assembly, Women Student Assembly, International Student Assembly, PSA, QUASA, Etc, etc, etc).  
All of that is under USG, I’d say that that’s pretty important to take an interest in.

Gen. David H. Petraeus, former director of the CIA who currently teaches at USC, weighed in on four technological developments that have emerged since the Great Recession on Wednesday evening at the USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study in Doheny Memorial Library.
Interconnected · Gen. David H. Petraeus spoke of how manufacturing, life sciences and information technologies are intertwined on Wednesday. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
During the hourlong discussion, Petraeus noted that the four revolutions of energy, manufacturing, life sciences and information technology are all interconnected.
Petraeus, who is well known for changing the tide in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said each revolution is dependent on one another. He emphasized that the energy revolution enabled the information technology revolution and great growth of storage, which led to the manufacturing revolution.
“When you take these four revolutions and you take the demographics of the United States, the state of the global economy, we may be on the threshold of the North American decades,” Petraeus said.
Petraeus described the “North American decades” as a time of success for not only the United States, but also for Canada and Mexico.
“These revolutions are historic and are going to give an incredible boost to our economy,” Petraeus said.
Following his lecture, Petraeus answered students’ questions about his opinion on cyber espionage and exporting oil to Asian countries.
He noted that in the near future, many new jobs will arise in several different fields, and encouraged students to be hopeful for what is to come. Petraeus said many of these new jobs will come through the evolving energy and manufacturing industries, noting that just this past week, the United States surpassed Russia to become the No. 1 producer of oil and gas in the world.
“This is coming soon to a theater near us, this is not fantasy,” Petraeus said. “There are already steps in the direction toward this.”
During the discussion, Petraeus cracked jokes about Edward Snowden and the U.S. legislature but became serious when asked a question about ethics within American policies during war. He referenced the infamous pictures of Abu Ghraib prison torture.
“We try to adhere to the letter and the spirit of the international law. With that said, we’re not perfect,” Petraeus said.
Petraeus also said that more attention needs to be paid to the nation’s shortcomings in education, immigration reform and infrastructure in order for the U.S. to stay ahead of other countries.
This was Petraeus’ second appearance at a USC event this week. On Monday evening, he spoke about the the importance of honoring veterans returning home from serving the country in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Many students responded positively to Petraeus’ discussion. Some believed the format of the discussion was helpful to understanding the conversation.
“It’s cool to have someone as famous as him come talk to us as equals,” said Rachel Jones, a junior majoring in political science.
Students also said that Petraeus provided more context to subjects that they already had an interest in.
“He gave me a more in-depth sense and knowledge of these issues,” said Berenice Yang Gonzalez, a junior majoring in political science and environmental studies. “It’s like knowing how to ride a bike and then learning how to ride a motorcycle.”
Students said the conversational format of the program was beneficial to their learning experience.
“It was insightful having his perspective because he looks at it from the top-down,” said Karthik Gollapudi, a junior majoring in computer science. “His experience will be helpful in integrating a lot of different departments and connecting them together.”
Editor’s note: The original article incorrectly listed Karthik Gollapudi’s major as business administration.

The Royal Swedish Academy awarded Dr. Arieh Warshel of the USC David and Dana Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences the Nobel Prize in chemistry Wednesday for spearheading extensive research on chemical processes.
USC hosted a press conference at Town and Gown on Wednesday morning in response to the announcement.
Laureate · Arieh Warshel, USC professor of chemistry and biochemistry, won a Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday. Warshel has been a professor at USC since 1976. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“[Professor Warshel] is a shining star in our academic community — a man whose groundbreaking ideas and innovative insights give guidance to the scientific community worldwide,” USC President C. L. Max Nikias said at the press conference.
Warshel’s triumph marks the fourth Nobel Prize awarded to a member of the USC faculty. Previously, Daniel McFadden, George A. Olah and Murray Gell-Mann won the award for economic sciences, chemistry and physics, respectively.
Warshel believes the honor will encourage others to pursue science.
“The field itself is very inspiring. The prize gives notoriety to chemistry,” he told the Daily Trojan.
Warshel’s work has the potential to help find a cure to devastating diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Nikias believes Wednesday’s announcement is yet another reason for the Trojans to be proud of their community.
“The academic quality of USC, overall, can only go up,” Nikias told the Daily Trojan.
At the press conference, Olah, a professor of organic chemistry, stood and addressed Warshel.
“It is very rewarding that you are being recognized for work that is done here,” Olah said at the press conference. “You are a homegrown product of this university.”
Warshel, who shares his award with Harvard University professor Martin Karplus and Stanford University professor Michael Levitt, has conducted research for his project since 1976.
All three winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in chemistry are of Israeli heritage. David Siegel, consul general of Israel in Los Angeles, was elated to hear the news.
“Israel has 12 Nobel Prizes, six of them in science. [Many] of them [are] done in collaboration with American research institutes — USC, specifically,” Siegel said. “There’s so much going on in Israel in terms of science that is important for humanity.”
Warshel said he plans to continue research in the same field in order to solve more chemical systems problems.
Warshel will share the $1.2 million prize for the award with his two colleagues. When asked what he will do with it, he was unsure.
“You can ask my wife,” he said at the press conference.
Students in the sciences were excited for what Warshel’s win could mean for USC.
“Winning a Nobel Prize is a global honor, and it’s a huge deal for USC and the chemistry department to have another Nobel laureate on the staff,” said Dylan Lee, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering. “It’s a great personal achievement for him because he’s put work into the research for many years.”
Others were excited for the influence Warshel’s work would have in fields other than chemistry.
“His research goes beyond just chemistry and has far-reaching implications for the pharmaceutical industry. It’s great for USC because it shows that staff members here conduct and are rewarded for research at the highest level,” said Moriah Mulroe, a sophomore majoring in environmental engineering. “I imagine it’s a great feeling to wake up in the morning and find out you’re a Nobel laureate.”
Warshel will accept his award on Dec. 10 in Stockholm, but he will receive more than just recognition and a monetary reward; the university is granting him free parking for the rest of his tenure.
“I have already instructed the transportation department of USC to assign you a parking spot and refund you what you have paid for this year,” Nikias told Warshel.
 
Congratulations to Professor Warshel, the USC Department of Chemistry, Dr. Max Nikias, and all those affiliated with the University! It is very inspirational to many of us. As a fellow Trojan and an alum, we could not be any prouder. Fight On!

I never deleted my dad’s cellphone number. And every so often, while I’m searching for something on my phone, I stumble upon it.
My father died on Oct. 9, 2009 — four years ago yesterday and 20 days before my 17th birthday. He’d fought a six-year battle with multiple myeloma and then one Friday …
And I never deleted his cellphone number. I’ve had at least two phones since then, maybe three. Yet, without hesitation, I’ve always allowed this contact to slip through the data syncs from old phone to new phone so that it may idly rest in my pocket never to be used but, once in a while, seen.
It’s something I think about a lot this time of year. And, at a certain point, when I’ve thought too long about it, the idea that I still have my dad’s phone number seems rather silly. For all I know, his number could belong to anyone ranging from a used car salesman to an IRS auditor.
But, in the end, despite having less utility than a slide rule in the age of graphing calculators, it’s extremely meaningful. So I keep it there.
Technology is often criticized for distancing us and polarizing us. It’s often attacked for pulling us away from the “real” world into an abyss where personality and identity can be deconstructed, reshaped and projected with the click of a Facebook or Twitter post. It renders one completely detached, they say, left with only stunted verbal skills and subpar personal skills.
There’s some truth to that. Yet, communication technology can genuinely be very comforting and that’s probably why I haven’t removed his cellphone number. Or deleted his email account, his Facebook, and LinkedIn.
Instead, as senseless as it might seem, these technological avenues, which exist with no real utility or value, have sprung into a source of invaluable connection.
In many ways, this should be nothing new. Like flipping through the letters of old, there is something inexplicably powerful about reading my father’s old emails to myself. I wasn’t even “friends” with my dad on Facebook or LinkedIn. Still, on the rare occasion when the worlds collide and I run into his name online it’s somehow consoling, even if a bit unnerving at first.
Despite its comparison to the past, one should not diminish just how remarkable it is to know that memory of my dad exists just a Google or email search away. It’s a privilege that my generation will increasingly have but one that has not always existed.
A little more than a year ago, I helped my mom go through some of her own mother’s belongings. First, there’s something you need to know about my grandmother. She was without a doubt one of the most just, kind, and generous people I’ve ever met. She also kept everything. This was something that only worsened with her dementia.
We found everything from campaign buttons to fading photos to aged trinkets to clippings of poems and news articles. As someone who is interested in the study of the past, they were nothing short of fascinating. Like my dad’s emails, they provided, for me, a way in which to connect and remember my grandmother. I even keep some of the photos we found in my room at home.
But these items are different when they exist on the Internet or on your phone. Unlike physical objects, they are always available and except for an occasional redesigned webpage or software update, the appearance of most content on the Internet is fixed.
In this sense, one could even argue that there is ironically a refined permanence to the content that we leave behind on our virtual reality known as the Internet. The corners of our tweets do not tatter from age nor do our Facebook photos, a fact that makes something inherently very unreal — something that, by its definition, exists virtually — very real. You might not be able to touch an email or a photo on the Internet, but the connection is still strong.
So, once again, pressing the delete button this year was paralyzingly difficult. And for the fourth time, I’ve decided to wait until next year.

The Downtown Art Walk enlivens the streets of Downtown Los Angeles the second Thursday of every month. Art Walk offers a unique L.A. experience that celebrates all that the city has to offer. Since its launch in 2004, Art Walk has revitalized the Los Angeles’ Historic District and earned it the Gallery Row nickname. Between Main and Spring Streets and Second and Ninth Streets, more than 40 galleries will open their doors to the public free of charge. This marks a departure from the appointment-only schedules kept by many Downtown L.A. galleries. In this sense, the galleries function more as free museums than sites selling artwork; this brings the focus to the public, not the collector. On this self-guided tour, patrons will encounter an eclectic mix of art, culture and food.
Opening up · The Downtown Los Angeles Art Walk will see many of Los Angeles’ private galleries open their doors to the public. Of the artists exhibiting include Dig Wayne, whose work “epiphany” is pictured. here – Courtesy of Dig Wayne
 
The first stop for any traveler should be the Art Walk Lounge at 634 S. Spring St. Aside from providing general information, visiting the lounge is a great way to get acquainted with the event. The October Art Walk features a map designed by ConArt and graffiti shoe art designed by Eklips, plus free Perrier water. The Lounge gives a sampling of the various galleries but visitors should really utilize the online Art Walk map generator in order to plan their routes in advance. Though galleries cater to many different tastes and address a variety of topics, many of the October exhibitions have a distinctly L.A. vibe. Artists’ treatments of urbanity and local history provide a perfect complement to an event that takes place in Downtown L.A.
Another perspective-shifting exhibition is Dig Wayne’s “Lefty’s” at CLADE Gallery.
“The idea behind my photography is to show people how much art is all around us that we never notice,” Wayne said. “I don’t make art, I just photograph things that are already there.”
Wayne uses extreme close-ups to draw out the beauty and texture from everyday objects and is “attracted to the tiny details in decaying metal or chipping paint.”
This statement encapsulates the charm of Art Walk, as it allows the community to come together and reimagine the mundane. As with Wayne’s images, Art Walk encourages viewers to reconsider the world around them and find beauty in unexpected places.
In addition, Wayne feels that art brings people together and provides a chance for artists to experience a range of works in close proximity.
“I think the role of art in a community is to bring people together; allow them to share in a common experience,” Wayne said. “Rarely do two people see that same thing in a piece of art; that can create a dialogue that may never have taken place otherwise.”
Art Walk provides a valuable experience for artists and viewers, allowing people to interact with their community and expand their definition of art.
The Spring Street Art Collective includes five galleries with a variety of shows. The Spring Art Tower also houses The Last Bookstore. This stop offers the most variety of any single stop and should be a destination on everyone’s Art Walk map.
The Gloria Delson Contemporary Art Gallery will hold an opening reception for Eddie Rhem’s “Rheming Out L.A.” exhibition the night of Art Walk. Rhem will present a special show titled “The Belligerent Transparency of Privacy,” which will feature a performance installation by the Suicide Girls from 6 to 10 p.m. This opening is multifaceted and innovative, which echoes the very nature of Art Walk.
In a similarly experimental style, The Smell focuses on D.I.Y. art and music in the community. The Smell produces Olfactory Records of local musicians and has regularly held $5 concerts since their founding in 1998. Their gallery, The Void, will be open for Art Walk.
Located next to Walt Disney Concert Hall is the REDCAT Gallery. This experimental extension of CalArts is committed to fostering community engagement with art. It follows that their current exhibit addresses the topic of water in Los Angeles. Andrés Jaque and the Office for Political Innovation will present “Different Kinds of Water Pouring into a Swimming Pool,” an architecturally focused exhibition which explores the backyard pool culture in Los Angeles.
Similarly, Diego Cardoso’s art explores the connections between cities, transportation and humanity. Cardoso’s art has a distinctly-L.A. character, and the issues he addresses about transportation and urban growth are both timely and thought-provoking. His realistic yet beautifully rendered depictions of the city make viewers see the city differently.
Even though it is nearly impossible to see everything in one night, Gallery Row is easily accessible by Metro, allowing curious minds the chance to experience an exciting and diverse array of artists and galleries in the heart of downtown.
“I guess that Art Walk is about that, as well as an inspiration for artists to view each other’s work without having to travel to different or far locations,” Wayne said.

Anchored by a gripping performance from Tom Hanks and the expert direction of Paul Greengrass, Captain Phillips is a pulsating, attention-grabbing thriller that never lets go, from the tense beginning to the startling conclusion.

Based on the memoir of Capt. Richard Phillips, who was taken hostage by Somali pirates during the Maersk Alabama hijacking in spring 2009, nearly every element of the feature — from the performances, to the rock-solid screenplay by Billy Ray, to the excellent pacing to the cinematography — helps to create a pressure cooker of a film.
Captain Phillips begins with a very short, but nonetheless important, prologue to introduce and humanize both Phillips and the group of Somali pirates.
Once the prologue ends, the story focuses almost exclusively on the hijacking and the hostage negotiation between the Somalis and the Navy SEALs. The audience never sees the Phillips family’s reaction to the situation or learns about the criticism that Phillips faced for having brought the Maersk Alabama so deep into Somali waters in the first place. For the sake of the film’s pacing, though, this more succinct approach is efficient and effective.
This condensed method syncs very well with the direction of Paul Greengrass, who directed The Bourne Ultimatum and United 93. Though only a few people associate Greengrass with the distinctive, if slightly infamous, shaky-cam cinematography of the Bourne franchise (and subsequent knockoffs), the director shows again in Captain Phillips that he knows when to use that style to benefit the story.
In this film, use of the shaky-cam style isn’t a gimmick. Instead, Greengrass uses it as a filmmaking tool to establish the claustrophobic tone of the film. In the final act, the technique creates a constant tension and helps the audience to get into the mind of Phillips as he desperately tries to keep his crew safe and stay composed under duress.
Even the shaky-cam perspective, however, can’t hide the fact that the first sequence — the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama — is a naturally more tense and compelling act than the next one involving Phillips. In the latter scenario, Phillips is trapped in the pirates’ lifeboat, but because the entire crew is in jeopardy in the former scene, it comes off as more intense.
Despite this small setback, the film’s final hour is nonetheless compelling. The film does an admirable job of showing the level of complexity and delicate maneuvering that the Navy SEALs had to work with to pull off what was considered an exceptionally well-executed operation. One really gets a sense of perspective of just how delicate the margin of error really was during the standout. If the Navy needs another marketing tool, this film certainly fits the bill.
Of course, the Somalis’ desperate efforts to make off with anything for their livelihood also leaves an impression. The portrayal of the Somali pirates is realistic and multi-dimensional; though they are certainly shown as intense and threatening, they’re never shown as sadistic. The film doesn’t get into the politics or the cultural situation that forced these four Somalis to risk their lives, but one can understand and sympathize with their circumstances.
The four actors, who are all Somali nationals, do a good job being fierce but never villainous. The best performance out of the group belongs to Barkhad Abdi and his portrayal of Muse as the desperate yet confident leader of the group. Though he’s the smallest member of the four pirates, his ego and sheer determination drive him to execute on the group’s goal.
Tom Hanks, however, makes the most lasting impression. Hanks holds this film together, as he captures Phillips’ attempt to keep his composure. Hanks hasn’t had this powerful of a performance since Cast Away. He plays Phillips as a white-collared man trying to handle the situation to the best of his ability and attempting to keep the crew of the Maersk Alabama, and even the pirates in the later half of the movie, safe. It’s not a stoic performance — one can see the man is petrified most of the time — but he captures someone who just doesn’t want to see anyone get harmed.
When the finale occurs, Hanks’ reaction is so touching and raw that one can really feel all the pain and shock that Phillips has gone through. It puts into perspective just how rough of an experience Phillips survived in real life.  This is definitely an Oscar-caliber performance, though shockingly it might not be the only one Hanks ends up with this year, as he’s also due to portray Walt Disney in the Oscar-baiting Saving Mr. Banks this winter.
A solid production throughout with well-delivered performances, quick pacing, and superb direction, Captain Phillips takes a thrilling true story and captures the raw intensity of the man at the center of it, the pirates who perpetrated it, and the folks who managed to get through a near-impossible standoff. And its inevitable conclusion promises to leave you relieved, exhilarated and maybe even a little startled.

In a recent study by Psychology Today, researchers tested how Facebook users felt moment-to-moment and how satisfied they are with their lives overall.
The study found that, “Facebook use predicts negative shifts on both of these variables over time. The more people used Facebook at one time point, the worse they felt the next time; the more they used Facebook over two weeks, the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time.”
Though Facebook has numerous advantages such as helping people stay connected, it has also been detrimental to many of its users. The site has grown from a small college project to a 500 million user forum, which you probably already know from the Oscar award-winning film, the Social Network.
Recent news published about Facebook and other types of social media have been negative, but it is not the sites that help or hurt people. Instead, it is how people use them.
For example, imagine a recent freshman starting out in college at a large research university. She is looking to feel a little more connected. She checks Facebook, and is instantly able to see photos and updates of her friends at home, making her feel more connected. The student begins to check the site more regularly, repeatedly logging on and surfing content.
Now she sees that her friends at home are happier, her friends at other schools make more friends, her friends at her new school have  more fun. Her internet connection actually makes her feels more alone. She logs out of the site, dejected.
Though this scenario is fictional, the phenomenon it relates is not uncommon.
The Human Computer Institute at Carnegie Mellon also found that “passive consumption” of the information on Facebook as well as your own “broadcasts to wider audiences” on Facebook correlate with feeling depressed and lonely.
So the rumors are true. But, before pointing a finger at Facebook and blaming one site for all of society’s problems, it is important to realize it is not the only player in the game.
According to an article written by Jessica Winter for Slate Magazine in July, Instagram, the popular photo-sharing service, actually makes users more depressed than Facebook.
Studies conducted by German universities found that it is not actually the use of all Facebook services that contributes to depression, but instead it is the process of looking through your friends’ photos and grudgingly liking vacation photos or good news in status updates.
Instagram is this service without the added benefit of sending messages or sharing popular news. Instead, it is just the stimulation of seeing the best moments of friends’ (and celebrities’) lives, captured in bite-sized pictures with artsy filters.
Scrolling through Instagram can trigger even more intense feelings of depression and self-loathing.
Hanna Krasnova of Humboldt University in Berlin, co-author of the study on Facebook and envy, explained that photos can provoke immediate social comparison, which can contribute to feelings of both envy and inferiority.
According to Krasnova’s study, “if you see beautiful photos of your friend on Instagram, one way to compensate is to self-present with even better photos, and then your friend sees your photos and posts even better photos, and so on. Self-promotion triggers more self-promotion, and the world on social media gets further and further from reality.”
So it isn’t just Facebook that has the power to promote depression. And, given that there are hundreds of social media services, it isn’t just Instagram either. Twitter can inspire jealously when sharing good news, Vine can create feelings of isolation when you see a group together without you, and even LinkedIn can make you feel important or not. Every day, more sites are being added to the collection.
Therefore, it isn’t the sites that cause the problem, it’s the way people use them. Use Facebook to send messages to your friends, communicate with groups or stay up to date on current events, and you’ll be fine. Use it as the be-all, end-all of comparison between your life and the edited, selected version of the users you’re friends with, and the world will be a very lonely place.
Remember what people post on their profiles, whether on Facebook or Instagram, isn’t a complete depiction of what their lives are like. The photos are the edited, filtered versions with the best lighting possible. Social media truly is what people make of it.
If users are ever feeling overwhelmed, they should consider deactivating or deleting their profiles, even if just for a little while. This will create some perspective, allowing them to see their lives and judge them for their own merit, rather than as a comparison to a stylized photo on an iPhone screen.
Every action in life is a choice. There are too many sites and too many options in the social media realm to prescribe a treatment for the problems they create. Rather, it is people’s use of the sites that will determine their happiness.
If people choose to use Facebook and Instagram in a way which connects rather than divides, sharing good news rather than envy, the negative effects of these tools can certainly be mitigated.

“A Plan to Save the Republican Party,” is the headline for Daniel Altman’s latest article in Foreign Policy. In it, the economics professor at the Stern School of Business describes the growing rift that began with primary challenges to Republican incumbents and most recently climaxed with the standoff over defunding the Affordable Care Act. Altman argues that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and the rest of the leaders of the GOP’s mainstream wing should essentially deploy the political nuclear option: a view that formally distances them from the Tea Party in hopes of saving the party in the long term.
Altman comes to the bleak conclusion that the GOP will “probably blow it.” If Boehner and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have any sense, they will find a way to save the party in the long term. That solution is a split. Encouraging a split in the GOP is not synonymous with the left’s long-held dream that such a split will eventually occur. A more moderate and economically focused Republican Party would not only pose a challenge to the Democrats, but would salvage the broken political system the GOP’s radical wing has created.
The Obama years, like them or not, have undeniably altered the makeup of the Republican party: Beginning with Sarah Palin’s mobilization of the Tea Party in 2008 (and the McCain-Palin ticket’s subsequent epic failure), the Republican party has become increasingly divided over opposition to the Obama administration’s agenda items, from social to economic issues.
Nowhere is this split more evident than in the culmination of the shutdown and debt ceiling debates.  Boehner, who has even privately admitted he would be willing to risk his speakership to prevent a default of the nation’s debt, seems to implicitly recognize that such a split is coming. Even Grover Norquist, the pioneer of the infamous “no new taxes pledge,” was not hesitant to ridicule Tea Party Republican Ted Cruz for “push[ing] House Republicans into traffic and wander[ing] away.”
A slew of weekend polls put Congress, and more specifically the Tea Party, at all-time lows in the polls. Midterm elections loom, as does the presidential election in 2016. A split now would prevent the nightmarish loss of mainstream Republicans’ seats to more right-wing primary candidates, as was the case for Richard Lugar in Indiana last fall. Moreover, it would insulate moderate GOP presidential hopefuls such as Gov. Chris Christie from the damage done by radical candidates such as former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum. Instead, the current GOP makeup bundles them all together, and election results such as President Obama’s resounding defeat of Mitt Romney, who was pushed too far to the right by the primary season, will be the inevitable result.
The division would also move the country forward politically. This is not to suggest it would make it easier for Democrats to push their agenda down the throat of Republicans, but rather to suggest that GOP opposition would become more rational, productive and effective. In the case of Comprehensive Immigration Reform, a slew of ad-hoc attacks on the path to citizenship provisions by the party’s more radical wing virtually obliterated the gains of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight,” which saw both parties come together to craft legislation that incorporated the goals of each. In a world where the GOP smartly endorsed a split from the Tea Party, comparatively more things would happen for the American people — and they wouldn’t necessarily be more liberal policies.
If Ted Cruz gets to read Dr. Seuss on the floor of the Senate, John Boehner should play more Taylor Swift on the floor of the House. The Republican Party is never, ever getting back together — and it will be better for all of us.

The Tea Party is just a way for desperate individuals to get some attention. How many tea Party candidates are running for President??? That should tell you something.
The party that ended government support for slavery is in a struggle for national relevance.
At what % of taxation are we back to state support for slavery?
Additionally, the Democrat. Party has to eliminate the far left Preogressives who have morphed the Politically moderate Dem Party into a raging left wing bunch of crazy people, Obama, Pelosi, Reid. Today, the Dems are so far left they wear two left shoes, and the GOP without the Tea. Party membership is right of center,as was the Dem Party 40 years ago.
JFK would’ve never been a Dem nominee today, and  Regan wouldn’t make the nomination either.
Both parties are out of control, and oddly enough, they are the same. It’s the Tea Party that makes the GO p honest and not an “other side of the aisle” version of the Dems.
It’s too late. They OWN them.
You can’t build a monster and keep it on a chain, but Republicans were too short sighted and went for the short term historical ‘knee jerk’ vote, instead of try and build a house worth standing for. 
I’d quip Zappa (poorly) if I might ‘The Republican Party is not dead, it just smells that way’.

What does the sexiest woman look like? Hint: she has blonde hair, blue eyes, plump lips and a proportionally “perfect” body.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
On Oct. 7, Scarlett Johansson was named “Sexiest Woman Alive” by Esquire magazine for the second time since 2006, making her the only woman to reclaim the title. Though it comes as no surprise that people think Johansson is beautiful, naming her the sexiest woman alive is a blow to the self-esteem of every other woman in the world. Let’s face it: No one in this world looks exactly like Johansson, so therefore it’s a ludicrous idea to impose this so-called ideal upon society.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and thus it is unfair to force one magazine’s idea of the most beautiful woman upon society. Sexy comes in all different hair colors, eye colors, skin colors, shapes and sizes.
But Esquire magazine is not the only culprit. Each year, People magazine announces who the “Sexiest Man Alive” is, with past winners including George Clooney and Channing Tatum. The title of “Sexiest Man Alive,” though awarded by a magazine with a predominantly female readership, can have the same negative effects on society as the title of “Sexiest Woman Alive” does. Men are compelled to reevaluate their look, and others feel the need to reconsider what their ideal guy might look like.
In addition to giving women an ideal image of unattainable beauty, the notion of “Sexiest Woman Alive”convinces men that their significant other must look a certain way. Because Esquire is a magazine written for men, this title is virtually telling men what to look for in a woman. This brings self-image anxiety to not only women, but to men as well, who might feel compelled to date a woman deemed “sexy” by society’s standards.
In USA Today’s article about Johansson claiming the title, all that they mention is that this is the second time she won, a quote about her current career as an actress, and information on her engagement to a former French journalist.
There is no backstory about her life or how she became famous, and the very short article makes it seem like the only thing Scarlett Johansson is good for is named the “Sexiest Woman Alive.” If young girls want to look up to Johansson, there isn’t much that the title allows them to strive for.
With a long history of the media causing self-image issues in young adolescents, the “Sexiest Woman Alive” title does not help. According to AdMedia, “69 percent of girls concurred that models found in magazines had a major influence on their concept of what a perfect body shape should look like.”
And now with Scarlett Johansson’s image on the front of Esquire with the bolded words “Sexiest Woman Alive,” young women have something else to unfairly compare themselves to. It promotes the idea that Johansson is what sexy looks like.
In the end, no one should feel obligated to care about who the “Sexiest Woman Alive” is. After all, it’s simply a title subjectively voted on by a men’s magazine.
 
Izzy Albert is a sophomore majoring in business administration.
The last sentence of this op-ed is ironic given the fact the writer cared enough about who the “Sexiest Woman Alive” is to write an entire article.
It is also hypocritical to pan a magazine’s celebration of beauty and sexy when we all make personal decisions about our relationships with this criteria weighing in as a large factor. I find it funny, women who chirp the loudest about the degrading nature of beauty titles are also the ones who would rather go out with the hunky dolt then have their yenta friends catch her going out with the super smart, super kind, short, fat, dumpy guy with zits…
If you truly want society to place less currency on looks – then perhaps you can start with yourselves.
Don’t worry sweetheart, brunettes are attractive too

Dr. Arieh Warshel of the USC David and Dana Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday.
The award recognized Warshel, Martin Karplus of the Université de Strasbourg in France and Harvard University, and Michael Levitt of Stanford University for “the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems,” according to a press release. The three men wrote computer programs that combined quantum mechanics and classical chemistry to understand the makeup of proteins and develop drugs to combat disease.
Warshel has been a professor at USC since 1976.
Warshel and his colleagues have each earned the title of Nobel Laureate and each will receive one third of the Nobel Prize total award of 8 million Swedish kronor, or approximately $1.2 million.
“For over four decades, Professor Warshel’s forward-thinking ideas and his unique ability to combine insights from many fields have continued to expand the capabilities of computational chemistry, transforming computer simulations into a predictive tool for studying biological systems,” USC President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement. “This is the kind of path-breaking work by world- renowned faculty that our academic community nurtures and celebrates.”
