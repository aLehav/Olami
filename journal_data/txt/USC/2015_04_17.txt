I am part of this incredible club on campus called “I Am That Girl.” It is a group of women who meet each week to talk openly about topics that matter. We share in our common struggles, laugh at one another and lift each other up. This week, the topic of conversation was called “Speak your Truth.” We ended up talking about one topic specifically that I find extremely interesting: vulnerability.
Being vulnerable is letting yourself feel something. It’s about showing your emotions and not being afraid of being hurt or what others will think. It sounds so simple doesn’t it? This is something that holds so much value in life, yet many are hesitant and even incapable to do so.
We live in generation defined by comparisons — social media has changed our whole perception of what individuality means, where people hold back their true opinions and shield one another of their identities. Why is this? Why are people so afraid of letting themselves go and simply being about to vulnerable? Why don’t people show their emotions enough? Maybe it’s a defense mechanism for people to withhold feelings. Maybe they are too scared to fail or get hurt. The answer is fear. We are afraid. Afraid of losing ourselves, afraid of being different, of failure, of being judged. Doesn’t the saying go, “It is better to have loved and lost than not to love at all”? One of the most important things in life is being able show your humanity. That’s why we are alive after all.
When we allow ourselves to let go, to feel vulnerable, we can do so much. We can use it for success and when we work with it, the hurt that we struggle with usually informs us and we can move on with the wisdom we’ve received. We are able to become trusting of ourselves and our ability to heal, rather than putting our trust into other people, that they will behave within a certain expectation of what we consider acceptable.
If we do this we are allowing ourselves to open up, to be who we want to be, by our own definition. Vulnerability brings us a common ground, and with that we can do wonders.

This past Sunday, I found myself wheezing as I climbed the impossible stairs of Mount Takao, located in the city of Hachioji near downtown Tokyo. It had been raining the night before, and the smell of wet loam and bark hung heavy in the air. Once in a while, there was the scuffing of a shoe and the scuttling of dirt, and looking up the trail, I’d see someone picking themselves up and gingerly patting the mud off their jeans.
Mount Takao, like most other mountains in Japan, has mystical qualities. This one in particular is said to be linked with the tengu, a minor deity in Shinto religion. They are usually depicted as humans with avian characteristics, including two great wings and a beak, which has transformed over time into a nose of Pinnochian proportion. Though potentially belligerent and dangerous, tengu are also the protective spirits of mountains and forests.
I have always loved Japanese Shinto and mythology, which has been equated to a kind of animism. It makes everything sacred, from withered trees to laughing streams. Climbing, weaving, and slipping through the trails of Mount Takao, I thought of the numerous forest spirits said to reside within the foliage and of the tengu who stand watch over the green leaves and brown soil with a stern countenance and upraised arm. It’s exhilarating to regard oneself as so close to the divine.
