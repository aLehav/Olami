For arguably the biggest game of the year, when cardinal clashes with powder blue in the classic USC-UCLA football matchup over Thanksgiving Weekend, many students will be watching from the couch instead of the stands.

Because this is the first year USC will not hold classes the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, more students said they are planning to take more time off to travel home. Conquest, generally held at the end of the school week, is being held tonight.
According to Heather Larabee, associate director for Campus Activities, the university has spent more money this year than last year to promote Conquest to make up for the fact that it is on a Monday.
“We spent more on advertising and giving away Conquest tokens and prizes, but there is not much we can do with the Pac-12 and the new schedule,” Larabee said. “We will have to make the best of it and hope students and alumni will attend.”
Elisha Jachetti, a senior majoring in theater, said she has never missed a USC home football game and used the Trojan Ticket Transfer system for the first time to help preserve the home-field advantage.
“I would absolutely love to go to the game and see us beat the Bruins,” Jachetti said. “But I’m from New Jersey and as much I hate to miss the game, family comes first.”
Many students said they plan on attending Conquest, not just to build school spirit before Saturday’s game but to watch Cobra Starship perform.
“Cobra Starship is my incentive to go,” said Hye Young Shim, a senior majoring in communication. “Cobra is a pretty mainstream band now and I’m very excited to seem them in person.”
Shim said she will travel to the East Coast for Thanksgiving break and is upset she will miss the game.
“It’s so annoying that the game is this Saturday because I really want to go,” Shim said. “But I promised my friend I’ll join her for the holiday, so I’m torn.”
USC football has struggled this season in overall attendance. Last week’s rainy game against Washington had the lowest homecoming attendance in a decade. USC is on pace this year to have the lowest average attendance per game since the 2002 season.
Despite low attendance numbers, many students believe a drop in attendance does not signify a drop in spirit.
“Our spirit right now is overflowing after that huge win against Oregon [during the] weekend,” said Andy Winningham, a senior majoring in business administration.  “It doesn’t really matter when we play UCLA or how many people show up. This is our bowl game and we’re going to blow them out.”

The university held its inaugural Comedy@SCA festival Friday through Sunday, holding screenings and discussions that featured a variety of directors, producers, writers, show runners and actors.

The festival, hosted by the School of Cinematic Arts and Visions and Voices, was held to launch the first ever comedy concentration program, which will teach the technical side of creating comedic movies and television shows. Comedy@SCA will be directed by Jack Epps Jr., the School of Cinematic Arts Jack Oakie endowed chair in comedy and associate professor of writing; Barnet Kellman, professor of film and television production, and David Isaacs, a visiting professor of screenwriting.
Epps said USC was the only institution qualified to host the festival.
“These people, over a three-day period, coming together, meeting on such a broad range of comedy: I think it’s extremely unique,” Epps said. “And, that was our hope and wish for this [weekend], to create a comedy festival in Los Angeles through USC.”
Epps said there had never been a similar festival held in Los Angeles. He introduced the weekend’s first event, a discussion between ’84 alumnus and director Peter Segal and actor Steve Carell.
“It’s really never been done in Los Angeles and it’s really overdue,” Epps said. “Tonight is the christening for Comedy@SCA, USC’s effort to become the destination institution for students who are serious about comedy.”
Segal summarized the significance of the program’s launch more simply by saying, “It’s about f–king time.”
Eric Pratt, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television, said the caliber of the cinema school’s connections displayed by the event put him at ease.
“It’s great that they have all these big names in one weekend,” Pratt said. “It really shows what kind of connections the School [of Cinematic Arts] has because you see where alumni end up and how they got there. … It’s really encouraging as an aspiring screenwriter.”
Organizers said the festival is historically significant because of the initiative it kicks off.
Comedy@SCA will provide classes for a concentration that will be open to all students starting spring 2013. Epps said the courses will be at the 400-level, so graduate and undergraduate students in all areas of study can take the classes.
“Comedy doesn’t know its limits and is open to everyone, so it’s an initiative of embracing comedy at USC,” Epps said. “The Harvard Lampoon is open to all of Harvard, so this is USC’s place for comedy.”
Sarah Zahedi, a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, said she is excited the classes will be open to those outside the School of Cinematic Arts because she has an interest in the production side of comedy.
“It’d be great,” Zahedi said. “I’d love to take those classes and be able to get a lot of good advice from people who really know what they’re talking about.”
Paul Feig, creator of Freaks and Geeks and director of Bridesmaids, said the School of Cinematic Arts discouraged comedy when he was a student between 1982 and 1984.
“I wish they had [a comedy concentration] when I was here,” Feig said. “All of the movies I made when I was here were comedies and they were met with a lot of derision and skepticism because the film school was a very serious place back in my day.”
Feig called the creation of a comedy-focused program “long overdue.”
“It’s so smart to do this because comedy is difficult,” Feig said. “Drama and other works are difficult too, but comedy has its own unique challenges and you can’t learn about them from people who don’t do it. You need the perspective of people who have been in the trenches and done it before to tell people how to get it right.”
During his discussion with ’84 alumnus and writer/producer Gabe Sachs, Feig said these mistakes were vital in learning how to create comedy.
“You only get better at comedy by making a ton of mistakes and it’s great to learn from people who have already made those mistakes,” Feig said. “It’s not like you won’t make those mistakes yourself, but you’ll know [what they are].”
Roy Parker, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television, said he was comforted by Feig and Sach’s discussion.
“For me and a lot of people it’s like wow, they’re talking about 290 and 310, which are classes we take,” Parker said. “It puts me at ease because they’re talking about making crappy little movies just like I make crappy little movies, and now they’re making big movies with Kristin Wiig. It’s encouraging to know we can move on.”
Brandon Baer, a sophomore majoring in critical studies, said the Comedy@SCA program directors’ experience will guarantee students of the comedy concentration’s quality.
“With their credentials alone, you know the people spearheading this program know what they’re doing,” Baer said. “It’s not every day that your school does this. Other schools that don’t have the same people couldn’t pull this off.”
Epps said USC’s location will be vital in its ability to grow the program, just as it was vital in booking speakers for the festival.
Epps said the Comedy@SCA initiative resonated with the spirit of the university.
“It really represents what’s special at USC,” Epps said. “People want to be part of the many initiatives our university has. It shows the breadth of initiatives we have, whether it’s in the sciences or law or medicine or fine arts. It’s part of what makes USC special.”

The first road trip of the season for the USC women’s basketball team wasn’t an enjoyable one, as the Women of Troy fell 67-60 to No. 12 Georgia on Sunday after being upset by unranked Nebraska 68-50 on Friday.
No. 23 USC (1-2) likely won’t be in the polls much longer after never leading in two games the Women of Troy had hoped to add as solid road victories to their résume.
“We definitely don’t come out as strong as we need to,” senior guard Jacki Gemelos said. “We kind of get the clue in the second half and try to close the gap, but we kick ourselves in the butt by not coming out in the first half as well as we should.”
USC’s game against Georgia was the second part of its home-and-home series that started last season with a win for the Women of Troy at the Galen Center.
This time, the Lady Bulldogs had home-court advantage and rode the crowd support to an early 21-7 lead.
A 3-pointer from Gemelos closed Georgia’s lead to 26-19 at halftime, but the Lady Dogs ripped off a 14-2 run to start the second half to essentially put the game out of reach.
Georgia still had a big 16-point lead with three minutes to go before USC strung together a 16-7 rally that was too little, too late.
Sophomore forward Cassie Harberts chipped in 15 points and 10 rebounds for a double-double in the losing effort, and Gemelos led USC with 18 points while playing all 40 minutes of the game.
USC was outrebounded 44-38 by Georgia and made only three of its 13 attempts from three-point range.
“We just weren’t hitting shots [this weekend],” Gemelos said. “To get out of this slump and into our rhythm, we just need to start hitting our shots, and we’ll be fine.”
That slump started on Friday night, when the Women of Troy made just three of 20 three-point shots, and were rolled 68-50 in a shocking upset to the unranked Cornhuskers.
Nebraska started out on a 9-0 run and led by 13 points at halftime after barraging USC with their fast-paced offense and full-court pressure defense.
That lead would be cut down to six points after a three-pointer by senior guard Ashley Corral made the score 44-38 with just less than 11 minutes to go in the game.
But the Huskers responded with a 18-4 run that ballooned their lead to 20 points and put the game out of reach.
The Huskers dominated on the boards, recording a 66-40 rebounding advantage led by three players with at least 10 rebounds.
Senior guard Briana Gilbreath led USC with 18 points.
The Women of Troy will have to try to stop their losing streak against one of the top teams in the country — they face off against No. 2 Notre Dame on Friday in the Junkanoo Jam in Bahamas. They’ll next play either No. 8 Duke or Gardner-Webb.
Despite this weekend’s tough losses, Gemelos is confident her team can pull off an upset or two in the Caribbean.
“There were times [against Georgia] when the score was really close, and that’s something in [and of] itself against the No. 12 team in the country,” Gemelos said. “We still have a lot of good teams left on our schedule and a lot of chances to redeem ourselves.”
Played somewhat better in 2nd half vs. Georgia although good run made the game seem closer than it really was.
Bench providing no help and inside play lacking in toughness. Cooper’s recruits way over rated at this point of the season. WNIT bound once again if decide to participate.

Having completed a grueling regular season schedule that pit them against top-four teams on seven different occasions, the Trojans have left no doubt as to which team the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament should field as its No. 1 seed.
Defensive · Senior goalie Joel Dennerley and the USC men’s water polo team completed an undefeated record in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play by holding UCLA to just six goals Saturday night. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
To claim this distinction, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team (20-2, 8-0) needed to win the season’s rubber match against UCLA, after the Trojans beat the Bruins in the NorCal tournament’s championship game 10-8 in September and the Bruins upended the Trojans in the SoCal tournament’s third place game 7-6 in early October.
Stationed with UCLA atop the NCAA water polo hierarchy to begin Friday, USC spoiled the Bruins’ regular season finale at the Spieker Aquatics Complex in Westwood, topping its crosstown rivals 9-6 en route to capping its third undefeated MPSF regular season in the last four years.
USC started off quickly against the Bruins, posting a three-goal lead at halftime.
Freshman driver Kostas Genidounias — USC’s fourth-leading goal scorer with 23 goals this season — continued to make up for the time he lost because of a hand injury by netting two goals, bringing his tally to four goals in the three games since he has returned.
Undoubtedly, USC will rely on the Greek freshman to provide secondary scoring throughout the postseason.
The Trojans managed to play UCLA to a stalemate in the second half, scoring four goals, but also surrendering four.
Senior goalie Joel Dennerley was charged with his first penalty of the season, which resulted in a UCLA five-meter penalty shot, for which Dennerley was prevented from manning his customary position between the pipes.
In his place, senior driver Peter Kurzeka, who is mostly known for his prolific scoring and had already deposited two goals into the Bruins’ net, gamely faced the shot, but could not stop it.
The penalty accentuated an unusual day for Dennerley, who is usually the centerpiece of any Trojan victory.
The native Australian and USC’s all-time saves leader only mustered three saves, mostly because of a swarming Trojan defensive effort, in which USC registered a bevy of field blocks and deflected a number of Bruin shots off cage before Dennerley could corral them.
His counterpart, UCLA goalie Matt Rapacz, was decidedly busier, turning aside 16 Trojan shots.
With seven different scorers accounting for nine goals against a top-tier team in UCLA, the Trojans’ offense does not lack for weapons entering the postseason.
Such a diverse scoring attack has made USC all the more difficult to defend as opposing defenses cannot key in on specific players or designed plays.
USC will enjoy a brief respite until Friday, when the Trojans return to the Spieker Aquatics Complex to play their opening round game of the MPSF tournament.
With a tournament victory, USC would earn a bid to the NCAA tournament as one of four teams and the likely No. 1 overall seed.
Even if USC falters in the MPSF tournament, a strong showing  might still earn it an at-large bid to play in the four-team field.

Capping off a tough weekend that saw seniors outside hitter Alex Jupiter, setter Kendall Bateman and middle blocker Lauren Williams playing their last regular season home game, the Women of Troy swept Arizona on Saturday after taking down Arizona State in four sets Friday night.
Senior Night was a little downplayed considering No. 1 USC (24-4, 19-2) will host the first round of the NCAA tournament, but being able to enjoy that plus winning the inaugural Pac-12 regular season championship made for a celebratory weekend for the Women of Troy.
“It was a very good week for us; the players are tired, but they really played hard and kept their focus throughout the weekend,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “The seniors appreciated the attention and it worked out perfect for us plus having the football team win, while we were celebrating made it a great weekend to be part of USC.“
Saturday’s victory against Arizona was USC’s 19th victory in its last 20 matches and marked the 20th time this season that it won by sweeping its opponent 3-0.
In her final home game, Jupiter passed Jennifer Kessy to become USC’s career leader in kills, with .607 on 18 kills to go along with five digs, three blocks and two aces.
Bateman turned in another 40-assist performance during USC’s romp against the Wildcats and she quietly sits just 40 assists shy of tying the USC career record held by Janice Mounts. Bateman also connected with Williams for 10 kills without a hitting error versus Arizona.
Madison Kingdon and Courtney Karst each finished the match with 10 kills, for the Wildcats (18-11, 10-10).
On Friday, the top-ranked Women of Troy took down an upstart Arizona State squad in four sets.
Just a night before their last home game, Jupiter, Bateman and Williams showed once again how valuable they are to the team. Led by a match-high 17 kills from Jupiter, which also included nine digs and four blocks, USC had its hands full trying to keep up with a Lady Sun Devils team that had four players with at least 10 kills.
Bateman attributed for 53 assists in the match as she outdueled Arizona State’s Shannan McCready, who also put in a strong effort with 48 assists.
In the second set, Arizona State took down the Women of Troy thanks to a 4-1 run to end the game, marking just the third time USC has recorded a victory that did not result from a 3-0 score.
Sophomore Alexis Olgard registered 20 kills over the weekend, including an error-free match against Arizona, and she continues to emerge as a viable option alongside Williams in the middle.
“Olgard is getting her legs now and starting to feel good and its really important for us that she continues to develop,” Haley said. “Once we have two middles who are 6-foot-5 hammering the ball down it becomes really hard for our opponents to handle.”
With two weeks to train for a neutral-site match against UCLA, the Women of Troy can rest up and mentally prepare for a deep NCAA tournament run.
“We want to keep getting better and stay focused as any improvements we can make give us the best possible chance in this tournament,” Haley said. “For us, it’s the focus that remains the most important thing.”

Poised · Junior forward Aaron Fuller led the Trojans on Saturday with 15 points and eight rebounds. Fuller said he was “embarrased” by USC’s 42-36 loss and called for the Trojans to “zone in” to coach Kevin O’Neill. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
For the third straight game, a USC men’s basketball game went down to the wire, and for the third straight game, the Trojans (1-3) were on the wrong end of the final score.
Coming off of a double-overtime loss to Nebraska and a narrow two-point defeat at San Diego State, the Trojans blew an eight-point lead in the second half against the Mustangs (2-1).
“Our guys should be embarrassed by their play in the second half,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “I would say maybe half of them are; the other half say it is [my] fault.”
Junior forward Aaron Fuller claimed to be one of the players affected by the defeat.
“I am definitely embarrassed by this loss,” Fuller said. “There are a lot of times where we zone out when [O’Neill] talks, but we need to zone in.”
Fuller paced the Trojans with 15 points and eight rebounds.
“Without Aaron, we would be in real trouble,” O’Neill said. “He has become the go-to guy for us.”
Despite USC’s height advantage, Cal Poly won the rebounding battle, 41-32, and grabbed more offensive rebounds, 16-6.
“Our guys are not blocking out,” O’Neill said. “We are just standing there watching the ball.”
Moore started the game for the first time at shooting guard, replacing senior guard Eric Strangis.
Sophomore point guard Maurice Jones finished with six points on 1-for-11 shooting, and sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon had only one point.
The two teams employed contrasting offensive strategies.
Cal Poly relied on outside shooting. Seventeen of the Mustangs’ 29 shots in the first half were from beyond the arc, although they only made two. They finished the game shooting .161 percent from the 3-point line.
The Trojans, on the other hand, worked the ball into the post, scoring 12 points in the paint in the first half, and half of their 36 points in the post overall.
The unusual start time at 1 p.m. seemed to bother USC initially, but it allowed fans to watch the football game against Oregon at 5 p.m. Most other men’s basketball games had tipped off at 7 p.m. or later.
The Mustangs opened the game on a 6-0 run, as the Trojans missed their first five shots of the afternoon.
With Cal Poly leading 11-9, USC went on an 11-0 run. During that stretch, junior forward Aaron Fuller had seven of his nine first-half points, and the Trojans went into the locker room leading 20-13.
The Trojans extended the lead to as many as eight points in the second half, but the Mustangs battled back to regain the lead at 33-32.
The Trojans recorded 10 of their 12 turnovers in the second half and only made six of 11 free throws after halftime.
“We melted down in the second half,” O’Neill said. “We did not get the job done on the boards, and we certainly did not get the job done offensively in the second half.”
The Trojans do not have much of a break over the Thanksgiving holiday.
On Tuesday, USC hosts Morgan State at 7 p.m. The Bears (0-2) return four starters from a team that went 17-14 last season, led by junior forward Dewayne Jackson, who averaged 14.5 points per game.
The Trojans will travel to Las Vegas for two games as part of the Las Vegas Invitational. USC will compete against UNLV on Friday at 4:30 p.m. The winner of that game will advance to face the victor between No. 1 North Carolina and South Carolina on Saturday at 7:30 p.m., and the two losing teams will play at 4:30 p.m.
“Right now we are a little out of sync, but we are going to get back in the lab, re-evaluate our goals, and get this thing back on track,” Moore said.
 
[…] Utah and Arizona State, to name just two, haven’t done much to help either. All that being said, Saturday night’s USC game was a new low. It’s not just that the Trojans lost to Cal Poly, a team that is a halfway-decent, […]

The most meaningless phrase you heard over the last week was that USC’s matchup at Oregon was its bowl game. It’s not because it’s a faulty premise — far from it. It’s because it’s been uttered before.
When USC traveled to South Bend, Ind., to face Notre Dame in mid-October, that was its bowl game. When ESPN’s College GameDay came to visit the Coliseum for Matt Barkley vs. Andrew Luck part three, that too was a bowl game for the Trojans.
So color me slightly confused when USC’s primetime matchup against the No. 4 Ducks on Saturday was again billed as a “bowl game” in a season in which it was ineligible for postseason play to begin with.
But no matter how you choose to classify the Trojans’ 38-35 upset victory over Oregon -— their first win in the state of Oregon since 2005 — it unquestionably puts USC coach Lane Kiffin and company back on the national stage, with a resounding thud.
Look no further than the Associated Press top-25 poll: USC is now ranked No. 10 — its highest ranking since Oct. 31 2009. For the first time since Pete Carroll left for the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks, the national consensus is as follows: USC has returned.
Over the last two seasons, Kiffin is 17-7 as USC’s headman, and undefeated in November this season, as the Trojans have put on some of their best showings as the season progresses. Sound familiar?
Since the second-year coach arrived in Los Angeles in January 2010, he’s been given the task of resuscitating a program that had been knocked down a peg — largely because of a myriad of limitations stemming from NCAA sanctions.
By the look of things now, it seems as if he knows what he’s doing.
Finally, in the mostly unlikely of places, Autzen Stadium, USC broke through, snapping the Ducks’ 21-game home winning streak, which dated back to 2008. It also marked Oregon’s first loss in Eugene under coach Chip Kelly, who took over for Mike Bellotti in 2009.
“’SC’s back,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “We shocked the world.”
USC had nearly broken through the glass ceiling before. Last year, it led then-No. 1 Oregon 32-29 at the Coliseum. Earlier this season, it took then-No. 4 Stanford to overtime.
This time, however, the ball finally bounced USC’s way — wide left, in fact.
Leading by three points, on the final play of regulation, Oregon kicker Alejandro Maldonado pushed a field-goal attempt left to give USC the win, even after the Ducks had driven 66 yards on 14 plays in just over two minutes following a fumble from senior tailback Marc Tyler at the 14-yard line.
“I talked to all our older guys and said ‘I don’t want to feel that way again,’” said redshirt freshman linebacker Hayes Pullard, who led USC with 14 total tackles. “And it came out on our side.”
Since the inception of the program, USC’s existence, to a large extent, has been predicated on winning and winning in marquee games.
In recent years, such victories had seemingly eluded the Trojans: the laundry list is well known.
But such wasn’t the case Saturday. USC jumped out to a 14-0 lead early in the second quarter. It eventually led 21-7 at halftime. It would later lead by 24 points. Perhaps, most impressively, it never trailed.
“This is exactly why I came to ’SC,” Robey said. “To play in environments like this; to beat guys like this.”
And at last under Kiffin, USC has beaten a top-five team.
To a large extent, it’s tough to follow “the guy.” The guy, in this case, being Carroll. There is added scrutiny, extra attention and a great deal of pressure.
Nonetheless, what Kiffin has constructed this season remains, without a doubt, one of the Trojans’ best teams in recent memories.
It won’t ring in the New Year at the Rose Bowl, unless someone was to accrue tickets, but by and large, it’s playing at a level most fans are accustomed to.
Provided things go as planned against UCLA, the Trojans will finish the season ranked in the top-10 with double-digit wins for the first time since 2008.
Sure, it could be 2006 all over — where the Bruins, 11-point underdogs, defeated USC 13-9 — but that’s a separate issue unto itself.
As of right now, under Kiffin’s watch, USC is back in the top-10, and it just might be there to stay.

In less than 12 minutes, Oregon had rattled off 21 unanswered points, cutting USC’s lead to 38-35 with seven minutes to play. A botched handoff from junior quarterback Matt Barkley to senior tailback Marc Tyler on the next possession gave Oregon (9-2, 7-1) enough time to march the length of the field to the Trojans’ 20-yard line. Oregon kicker Alejandro Maldonado, however, missed a potential game-tying field goal wide left as time expired and USC (9-2, 6-2) escaped Autzen Stadium with a 38-35 victory in front of a sellout crowd of 59,933.
Upset special · USC junior quarterback Matt Barkley celebrates a narrow, three-point victory against No. 4 Oregon, snapping the Ducks’ 21-game home winning streak and giving the Trojans their first win in the state of Oregon since the 2005 season. Barkley completed 26 of 34 passes for 323 yards and four touchdowns to lead USC to its ninth win of the season. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“To break the longest home winning streak in the country says a lot about this team and how far they’ve come,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I’m really excited for our fans, first off. They’ve been through so much. And secondly, for our players — the way these guys have come together these last five or six weeks is great to see.”
Though Oregon came into the game ranked third nationally in points per game, the USC defense held the Ducks scoreless in the first quarter for the first time all season and the Trojans’ defense limited them to just 36 yards of total offense in the period.
USC, meanwhile, struck first as Barkley connected with freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee midway through the first quarter to give the Trojans an early 7-0 lead. Lee finished with eight receptions and a career-high 187 yards and one touchdown.
“I was just focused on making plays for our offense,” Lee said. “Robert [Woods’ injury] was a big deal. We had the opportunity to step up.”
Though Woods’ availability for the game was limited because of nagging injuries, Barkley found his favorite target for a 12-yard score early in the second quarter to extend USC’s lead to 14-0.
Oregon responded quickly, with quarterback Darron Thomas finding tailback De’Anthony Thomas for a 29-yard score. USC would answer right away when Barkley connected with Woods for the second time to extend the lead to 21-7.
Woods finished with seven receptions for 53 yards and two touchdowns.
“Robert was still not 100 percent out there,” Kiffin said. “But he was making plays and he stepped up when we needed it.”
With the Ducks on the verge of cutting the lead to a single score again, the Trojans’ defense forced and recovered a fumble at their own 9-yard line seconds before halftime, keeping the lead at two scores.
“That was a huge turnaround for us,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “[Oregon was] about to score and change the momentum of the game. [Junior safety] Jawanza Starling came up with a huge recovery and it made a huge difference.”
Despite trailing at halftime, Oregon had accumulated 221 yards of total offense compared to 211 for USC. Saturday was also the first time the Ducks had been held to single digit points at halftime since Nov. 13, 2010, at California.
Coming out of the locker room, USC used that momentum, extending its lead to 24 points at 38-14 after a field goal, a 3-yard run from Tyler and a 5-yard pass from Barkley to redshirt freshman tight end Randall Telfer in the third quarter. Barkley finished 26-of-34 for 323 yards, four touchdowns and one interception. After the game, Kiffin was quick to praise his quarterback’s performance.
“If you look at what he’s done with a bunch of young people, I can’t imagine other players putting up the same numbers,” he said.
Though the Trojans’ looked comfortably in control, the Ducks’ offense kept coming. De’Anthony Thomas returned a 96-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, junior tailback Kenjon Barner notched his second score of the night and junior tailback LaMichael James cut the lead to a single score on a 1-yard plunge. Barner and James combined for 201 rushing yards and three scores while Thomas finished with 214 all-purpose yards and a touchdown.
“I never felt comfortable,” Kiffin said when asked about USC’s lead. “[Oregon is] so explosive on offense. They’ll literally score in a minute. You look up at the clock and there’s 13 minutes and that’s an eternity.”
That eternity turned out to be almost enough time for Oregon to extend the nation’s longest home winning streak to 21 games. But the defense made one last stand, forcing the Ducks to settle for a game-tying field goal that Maldonaldo ultimately missed.
“The fact that we finished and pulled the big win was huge,” Barkley said. “We needed it. Last year the big games didn’t really go our way in the end. On all parts we played lights out — special teams, offense and defense. We came in expecting to win and we are happy that we can celebrate like this.”
 
Quick hits
-Saturday’s home loss was the first in Oregon coach Chip Kelly’s tenure as head coach.
-With four touchdowns in Saturday’s contest, Barkley moved into second place on the school’s all-time list for passing touchdowns with 74. He currently trails former Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart, who threw 99 touchdowns over a three-year span as a starter.
-The USC defense held Oregon to just a 50 percent conversion rate (3-of-6) inside the red zone. Entering the game, the Ducks had converted on more than 91 percent of their opportunities inside their opponents’ 20-yard lines.
I have been a USC fan since the mid-fifties days of Jon Arnett and C. R. Roberts.  
This Saturday’s USC/Oregon game was a great game.  I do have one comment on the refs though.  I think that the no call on the interception play Oregon made on Barkley was bad but the intentional grounding call was atrocious.
That game was an invitation to all the bandwagon fans who defected the Trojans to jump back on.  Oh, joy.
Great game, great effort.  Congratulations to the team and coaching staff.  It was a proud day for the Trojans!
That was a sweet win. Duck fans are nasty people who say nasty things about us…so it was nice to hear silence for once.
A phenomenal signature win for Kiffen and the Trojans on national television. Fight On!!

Police can detain you based on your appearance and schools must verify your family’s immigration status. If you show up to work and your skin is slightly brown, you risk being deported. This is not Nazi Germany or Orwell’s 1984 dystopia, this is present-day Alabama.
Throughout history, racism has been a part of this southern state and lawmakers added to that infamous history on Sept. 28 when they passed one of the toughest immigration laws in decades. Since Arizona Senate Bill 1070 was passed on April 23, 2010, a series of copycat laws that encourage racial profiling and mock civil rights have surged across the United States.
Proponents of these laws have been able to get away with it because the federal government has failed at pushing immigration reform. A lightly politicized and leaderless Latino community has stared in awe at the sight of these injustices. In a time they need it the most, Latinos and illegal immigrants have no Martin Luther King Jr.s or Harvey Milks to turn to.
Latinos constitute 12 percent of the USC undergraduate student body, comprising a large portion of a school that prides itself on diversity and having the most international students in the nation. Why haven’t we seen student demonstrations against these new immigration laws? They might not affect the Latino community directly yet, but they are taking a toll on Latino identity and heritage in this country.  Apathy and lack of collective, organized action is something that haunts Latinos nationwide and locally.
While USC’s Latino students enjoy the sun and fun of Southern California, Latinos in Alabama protest, fearing deportation and the possibility that college will cease to be an option. There must be a group within the Latino community that believes in the possibility of change. Hope is still alive. Just take a look at what California has achieved with the DREAM Act. How can the laws of the same nation differ so greatly from state to state? While some laws grant in-state tuition, others simply terminate the possibility of higher education for illegal immigrants.
This is how the system is designed: Let illegal immigrants in when America needs them and send them home when America no longer requires them. President Barack Obama promised to fix this through comprehensive immigration reform. And yet, a record number of deportations have occurred during his presidency.
America needs to remember its roots. The United States is a nation built by immigrants. In 1942, Mexicans jumped in to fill the labor force gap when the United States entered World War II and since then, Mexicans and Central Americans have become the backbone of the agricultural and low-income industries. America owes its greatness to these people, and it can start paying back through the creation of just laws and comprehensive immigration reform.
Latinos should be aware that achieving immigration reform will come at a price. Blacks fought the Jim Crow laws through tenacity, leadership, persistence and persuasion. Latinos need to know no one is going to give equality to them; they have to rise up and take it. USC and other universities can forge a new generation of Latino leaders that are able to fight for this cause. USC Latino student organizations can start by taking their school’s motto to heart: “Let whoever earns the palm bear it.” Latinos, Hispanics and illegal immigrants need to stop being the largest silent majority among minorities. Sometimes working hard and taking jobs that pay below minimum wage is not enough — sometimes you just have to fight the power.

Your article flirts with the “by any means necessary” school of thought, which I guarantee you will NOT result in any gains for Latinos in the United States. I will have the opposite effect, it will SPEED UP legislation and outright vigilantism against Latinos, especially in border states. By the way, I’ve traveled extensively throughout Central and South America, the racism that Latinos experience here is nowhere near the extent of racism that indigenous and Central Americans face in Mexico. Or the racism that Souh Americans face in Spain. The fact that we allow so many of these folks to do here what they cannot in their own countries (make a living for themselves, support their families, and educate their children) I would say that America has been more than hospitable. However, guests cannot stay indefinitely and basically turn America into the very places they escaped from. That’s why the nation state must protect it’s borders – to protect it’s identity.
the hispanic/illegal/undocumented/latino/etcetcetc debate is an overemphasis on semantics and hurts the quest for unity that is necessary to move a people forward. but anywho, I like that you bring up the topic of the lack of mobilization behind the issue (as a senior and a person of an increased melanin count at this university, i have witnessed and been frustrated at that difficiency and apathy of people who would care about this issue more broadly). However, i do caution against a top down approach to making anything happen, MLK and others, as great as they were, were nothing without the grassroots movements they represented. It is not on some once in a generation leader to make things happen (the present state of political discourse makes it nearly impossible for the MLK and Malcolm X types to come exist, thank the 30 sec sound bite). Its on individuals and the grassroots, always has been always will be. My advice is to look into groups like IDEAS and MEChA and do your part.
Hmm….strangely enough I don’t remember the pilgrims applying for visas to come over here…
The colonies and then the country were built upon slave labor….illegally transported immigrants from Africa…
The transcontinental was built by the labor of Chinese immigrants that would be considered “illegal”…
Many businesses, especially food service and agricultural, rely on immigrant labor…just look at the disaster in Alabama…
Many of the greatest contributors to American culture and prosperity are immigrants…
Wow, this article is all over the place.  I especially like how you have somehow removed any difference in meaning between the words latinos, hispanics and illegals.  You frequently interchange the words for one another.  I wasn’t aware that everyone of hispanic descent was illegal.  How can you write an entire article about immigration but make no mention of citzen vs. noncitizen?  While there is much scapegoating and mistreatment of illegal immigrants in this country, most of whom are extremely hardworking and simply seeking a better life for them and their families – to portray the entire hispanic ethnicity in America as under attack is simply wrong.  Legal Americans of hispanic descent are the most courted voting block in the country.  That will only grow as will their political power.  We have an entire month in this country dedicated to recognizing the contributions of hispanics, called Hispanic Heritage Month, since the 1980s when President Reagan signed it into law.  Hispanics hold elected offices at the highest levels of local, state and national government, are successful businessmen/women, public safety officers, university professors, anything they set their mind to and wish to become.  If you seek to offer citizenship in this country to anyone that comes into it, thats your right to pursue it.  But don’t pursue it under the guise that America hates everyone with the last name of Garcia, Lopez or anyone of hispanic descent.  Its simply not true.
Rafael, you are delusional if you think America   “owes its greatness” to illegal aliens.

Higher education is a privilege not a right. Human security is a right not a privilege. Let’s get our priorities straight.
I hate how every time people talk about Latino interests, they talk about supporting the Dream Act. I’m all for immigration reform, but the Dream Act is not where its at. As a Mexican-American, I don’t support the Dream Act and its just ridiculous that if you are Latino you suddenly have to hop on the bandwagon. Focus on taking care of the people who really do need help, like the illegal workers who are suffering out in the fields and being exploited everyday. Those are the people you should advocate for if you’re talking about injustices towards illegal immigrants, not helping some illegal student who feels some sense of entitlement to receiving a higher education.
Where to start?
First of all, for someone who supports the rights of immigrant farmworkers you sure use “illegal” to a nauseating degree.
Secondly, there is no sense of entitlement with any of the DREAMers that I have met or any that I have read about or seen on video.  These students aren’t sitting back, waiting for a handout.  They have worked as hard, if not harder, than many of us who are documented.  They bust their humps to excel in their studies, they work at least one job in order to make up for the lack of economic security that their “illegal” parents, as you would put it, must deal with in the pursuit of a better life, and they are amongst some of the most active students (participating in student organizations, community groups, etc.).
Lastly, American politics have rarely ever addressed the most pivotal issues for all of America’s inhabitants (I mean, the U.S. Constitution didn’t even address the issue of slavery!!).  This is especially the case today where we see Republicans’ outright obstructionism at play and Democrats’ lack of leadership and courage.  By some stroke of luck or as the effect of ten years’ pressure, the needs of the undocumented student population have gotten enough attention and support, have been successfully addressed through legislation.  
Even if undocumented student rights are not your passion, you can at the very least appreciate that this political victory can lead to addressing other issues that affect the Latino/Hispanic/”illegal” populations.  
What we are experiencing here is an opportunity for the Latino vote to exercise its power and shape the political conversation.
Sí se puede!  Fight On!
Rafael, you bring up great points! Thank you for informing us and making the call to action. I definitely believe that not enough attention is being paid to the atrocities happening in Alabama. It is as if after Arizona and the important victories for immigrants’ rights, people thought that everything was finally well. The fact of the matter is that Arizona was only the beginning, and Alabama should be getting more attention because the violations of civil and human rights are in many cases worse than with SB 1070!
I would also like to comment on your use of the word “illegal” when referring to undocumented immigrants–it is a word that we are trying to get rid of because, as may well know, no human being is illegal. This is something that the immigrant rights movement constantly tries to emphasize. I encourage you to take a look at this page, and help stop the use of the word “illegal” when referring to undocumented workers: http://colorlines.com/archives/2011/04/take_action_no_human_being_is_illegal.html
There is leadership developing here on campus.  
IDEAS Movement at USC is a new student organization that is focused on the needs and interests of undocumented students (and that includes immigration and undocumented Americans in general)!
We co-sponsored two great events this November to raise awareness and are currently developing a Spring Series that will touch on all areas of immigration and the undocumented.  We aim to educate the entire USC population with the goal of creating a more welcoming and understanding campus, as well as positive results in the upcoming election cycle and in future policies and laws.

International students from across the world are flocking to America’s higher education institutions in greater numbers than ever, particularly students coming from China.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
The benefits of Chinese students’ presence are obvious: increased diversity, numerous economic benefits and increased competitiveness for U.S. universities on a global scale .
American universities are focused on heavy recruiting, however, in those areas without considering the effect on the application process for Chinese students.
As a result of increased pressure to attend a top-notch American university, some Chinese students are turning to college placement agencies to put them on a guaranteed track to American schools.
According to Bloomberg, the number of Chinese agencies has risen four times since 2006, with 400 agencies in China.
How could a foreign agency ever promise enrollment in American colleges, especially for students who might have less-than-stellar grades? It’s simple — by writing students’ application essays, providing fake transcripts and fake recommendation letters, and receiving a hefty sum in return.
It’s a lucrative business in China. Schmidt interviewed two employees who work for a placement agency, Shanghai Shenyuan, who said they wrote application essays for three out of every four students.
It might seem like a distant problem, but Shanghai Shenyuan has had partnerships with more than a dozen American universities. And that’s just one placement company.
The popularity of such companies sheds light on a pandemic of pressure and cheating that has infiltrated America’s higher education institutions.
The Los Angeles Times reported on Nov. 14 that USC is the U.S. university with highest foreign enrollment with more than 8,600 international students enrolled for the 2010-2011 academic year. The foreign country from which the most students hailed: China.
It’s time for universities to rethink their application processes in order to lessen the need for services such as these agencies.
For Chinese students who have a completely different college admissions system — high school students just take one test that determines where they will attend college — the overload of SAT, ACT, recommendations and essays necessary to present yourself as a qualified student in the United States can be understandably overwhelming and stressful.
This is where the college placement agencies come in.
Rob Schmitz, China correspondent for the American Public Radio’s program Marketplace, recently reported on these controversial agencies.
“If you walk down the street in Shanghai, it’s hard to miss the advertisements for college placement agencies. In big bold letters, they promise — some even guarantee — your child’s admission to an American university. The price: $5,000, $6,000, sometimes $7,000,” Schmitz said in a Marketplace broadcast.
One way to prevent falsified applications and the overwhelming pressure of the application process is for universities to place a heavier emphasis on interviews.
Interviews cannot be faked and they give most students a much better chance at presenting themselves to schools than they could on paper.
It’s easy to get caught up in the economic and academic appeal of foreign students, but universities need to look beyond this and fix the process that brings them here.
 
Elena Kadvany is a senior majoring in Spanish. Her column “Beyond the Classroom ran Mondays. 
This is correct. I’m not sure an interview should be such a sweeping solution. Granted, the admissions process is broken, but there should be other solutions as well such as in-person testing.
The Ivies once boasted about the number of international students. The Ivies no longer need to sell themselves; actually, they never had to. The UCs rely on their copious Nobel laureates. USC takes pride in its stellar football program (the quacks got whacked!), but they need something else to boost its academic image.
I don’t think writer can make an conclusion that international students have fake transcripts, fake recommendation letters and application esays based on the phenomenon that China has more agencies.
More agencies directly mean they help international student to write fake things. This is a logical fallacies because these are not cause and effect. As advisors in high school, agencies provide suggestions on how to choose among top universities. Because China now lack advisors in high school and the need for professional advising grows rapidly, more agencies grow quickly.
I agree that universities provide more opportunities for interviewing to choose qualified students because it is also a good opportunity for international students to show their talent and true work.
Why are we worried about getting more Chinese students into our University?  Shouldnt we be focusing on American students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds?  International students come here, learn from the best professors in the world and take back that knowledge to their countries to compete directly with our economy.  I am not advocating keeping these students out, but at some point we need to look at the long term gain from investing in homegrown students as opposed to soliciting international students who can pay full tuition.
Not really. I don’t follow the “affirmative action sentiment” like you. I agree with some of its points, but not all. Some arguments of affirmative action are that it “stops the vicious cycle of self-doubt; creates role models; makes universities’ demographics more diverse,” etc. There are so many 1/2 truths and fallacious arguments to these assertions. I’ve taken “diversity classes” such as identity-politics and what not, but the sentiment is almost always ultra-left while vilifying whites and East Asians. East Asians succeed academically because they have self-drive and discipline; we aren’t inherently smarter than any other race. We don’t always dwell on math neither. 
As one RACIST instructor of a “racial tolerance” class I once took, but never again, scoffed, “why do Asian girls always date white guys?” was the question she asked while snickering and gloating. I could’ve sunk to her level by asking her the rhetorical question of “which race has the worst stereotypes in this country?”…But I didn’t. By the way, this scum isn’t an instructor at classy USC, thank god.
Im not sure where you pulled the affirmative action from, or why you even used the quotation marks.  I never said anything about affirmative action and I am not advocating it.  What I am saying is that there are a lot of kids here in the United States that would benefit from Universities like USC changing their applications to help them instead of foreign students who, for the most part, are not even going to stay and contribute to the United States’ economy or workforce.  When I say disadvantaged I mean disadvantaged.  I am not talking about skin color or affirmative action, I am talking about those students who may not be able to either afford college or who have come from difficult socioeconomic backgrounds.  You dont have to be a minority to have grown up poor, with a bad public education and a rough family life.  Thats why I dont support questions about race/ethnicity.  If a school wants to be diverse, ask about socioeconomic backgrounds and bring in kids from all walks of life.  The fact that a lot of kids who come from these backgrounds are minority doesnt take away from the argument that more needs to be done to help these types of students gain a college education.
International students might be able to gain admission to US universities using fake academic credentials, but they still have to be able to earn a degree. Interviewing these cheaters is not the answer, I’m afraid, since they are probably good at lying to someone’s face.
True.
But if they are not granted admission at the first place, other students who really deserve the admission will get chance.

You know Thanksgiving is near when frozen turkeys go on sale by the pound and your family lugs three-pound bags of cranberries home from Costco. It’s the all-American celebration, a blend of European tradition with native game and produce.
Turkey time · Thanksgiving meals are no longer limited to traditional American customs and have instead opened themselves up to various cultural alterations. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
Just about half a century ago, the Thanksgiving menu was standard and predictable: roast turkey, an indigenous bird; cranberries, the fruit traditionally used by early colonists and Native Americans to flavor meat; and pumpkin pie, another native ingredient baked into America’s favorite dessert.
But as America’s diversity expanded beyond European and African minorities, non-traditional ethnic dishes started slipping into the customary November feast. Every ethnicity, region and family began to offer its own traditional additions.
While growing up in Singapore, I only had a vague idea of what Thanksgiving was. To me, the holiday was just another excuse to feast, a prelude to Christmas’ gluttony.
When I moved to Northern Virginia, I finally got the chance to enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner with my church. Instead of an intimate gathering around a table laced with fall decorations with a whole turkey centerpiece, our Thanksgiving dinner was another loud, boisterous Asian potluck party.
In lieu of stuffing, mashed potatoes and green bean casserole, we had stir-fried glass noodles mixed with funky wood ear mushrooms and pork, soy sauce-marinated turkey legs and whole eggs boiled and saturated in a broth of Coca Cola, soy sauce and spices. My mother always brought a huge plate of japchae, the traditional festive Korean noodle dish. There was no dessert because the older generation Chinese didn’t like American sweets.
It was only through books and TV that I realized this was not the traditional American Thanksgiving. I was disappointed; I wanted a nice, all-American dinner just like the families on TV. Determined to “Americanize” my church, I baked pecan pie and pumpkin pie from scratch for the next few Thanksgivings. But I soon became discouraged and stopped because although the chow mein disappeared from the buffet table within half an hour, my sweet American pies stayed mostly untouched.
Moving out of my suburban neighborhood in the East Coast to the more metropolitan, multi-ethnic Los Angeles, I discovered I wasn’t the only one celebrating a non-traditional Thanksgiving. The holiday, after all, was born in part from colonists homesick for England, hungry for their ancestral dishes and customs; it was only fitting that new immigrants would garnish the American tradition with their own.
That made me wonder: What other non-traditional dishes do people eat on Thanksgiving? To find out, I dished the question to friends, friends of friends, co-workers and neighbors.
Turns out, many Latino families eat tamales, a traditional celebratory food, with other more customary Thanksgiving dishes. Many Mexican families dole out mole on whole turkey; for a Oaxacan twist, the famous chain Guelagetza is offering smoky black mole with a 12- to 14-pound turkey marinated with chile paste, spices and chocolate.
Several of my Chinese and Taiwanese friends baste their turkeys with soy sauce and stuff them with common Asian ingredients like scallions and garlic. Others who are not quite so culinary hop over to Chinese supermarkets in San Gabriel, such as 99 Ranch Market, to pick up ready-made turkeys with sticky rice speckled with Taiwanese sausages, dried shrimp and shitake mushrooms as “stuffing,” or Chinese restaurants, such as Sam Woo and Plum Tree Inn, for a star anise-spiked, crisp-skinned turkey roasted à la Peking duck.
There are minor distinctions within regions as well. Corn bread stuffing is more common in the South; country ham is a familiar Thanksgiving protein in Maryland and Virginia; barbecue smoked brisket is common in Texas; stewed sauerkraut and fruit-filled strudels crop up in Midwestern states where there are high German and Scandinavian populations.
A friend with Polish heritage confided that there’s always pierogis and chruscikis on her family’s Thanksgiving table. Another with Irish heritage told me mashed potato is done Irish-style with shredded cabbage, called colcannon. Yet another mentioned dense Hungarian walnut loaf half made from crushed walnuts.
Not all alterations are made because of one’s heritage. Many times, substitutions are made for reasons as straightforward as dietary restrictions. Macaroni and cheese or spaghetti might slip in beside the mashed potatoes that might be replaced with potato salad by another family. Not surprisingly, Los Angeles is a safe haven for vegans and vegetarians on Thanksgiving, as many places offer animal-free Thanksgiving menus. Organic, vegan meals are served free on Thanksgiving afternoon on a first-come, first-serve basis at Café Gratitude on Larchmont Boulevard.
Pay attention to your Thanksgiving feast this year, and even take a peek at your neighbor’s Thanksgiving table. You might find regional and ethnic twists in each household, distinct customs that burrowed into deep-rooted traditional menu — not that it’s any less “American” in this melting pot nation.

The year 2000 Movie “What’s Cooking?” had a nice Take on Thanksgiving in L.A. I am an ABC (American Born Chinese) and the only “Ethnic-Bent” on Thanksgiving is my Watercress Soup. After Par-Boiling my rack of ribs (before they are BBQ’d), I save the Broth. Skim the FAT and add Watercress. Otherwise it is just Deep-Fried Turkey and Mushroom-Sausage-Cornbread Dressing. Happy Thanksgiving!
Great column! I the little additions/changes/omissions make the meal truly ours. I know ours is never right without kimchi and rice! :)

After the monstrosity of Eclipse, viewers should go to theaters with low expectations for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1. Though there’s something enjoyable about a so-bad-it’s-good film, not even Twi-hards can prepare themselves for the atrociousness of Breaking Dawn.
Viewers assume Breaking Dawn will disappoint, but even with these low expectations, they will be shocked by how terribly heinous the film is and will be mortified that this series plays such a prominent role in American cinema.
First and foremost, the exploitation of sex is an insult to filmmaking. Between opening the film with Jacob (Taylor Lautner) running through the rain with glistening, well-defined abs and Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward’s (Robert Pattinson) disgustingly desperate lust, the first half of Breaking Dawn comes off less as a vampire film and more as soft-core porn.
It’s no secret the film is geared toward teenage girls, but there comes a point where viewers can see Bella and Edward kiss only so many times.
The sexual exploitation continues with repeated use of the alpha male fighting for power and love. We get it: Jacob loves Bella, Edward loves Bella and Bella, being the weak and indecisive character she is, goes back and forth between the two. This love triangle was established in New Moon and should not even be a matter of discussion at this point.
In Bella’s defense, she finally agrees to marry Edward. The repetition of these confused feelings, however, is tiresome and cliché. What the audience craves and needs most is an interesting development.
Granted, director Bill Condon and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg cannot be completely accountable for this disgrace to filmmaking. Stephenie Meyer’s popularly acclaimed teen novel gives the director and screenwriter little to work with, but the repeated exploitation and poorly written narrative will leave viewers uninterested.
Narrative flaws serve as the greatest hindrance to the film. The poorly crafted characters are unlikable, leaving the audience feeling unsympathetic. As if the characters were not obnoxious, dull and one-dimensional enough, the leads’ portrayals are painfully awkward and unconvincing.
For instance, lines like “No measure of time with you would be long enough, but we’ll start with forever,” would be hackneyed in any right, but when delivered by Pattinson, the cliché factor is exaggerated to the highest degree. The squinting eyes, pouting lips and deep, testosterone-infused voice simply do not work in his favor.
To make matters worse, the trite montages interspersed throughout the film work as cop-outs for believable, convincing acting, adding flashy elements just for show. In one instance, the viewer sees through Jacob’s perspective, as he runs through the woods in his wolf form, tormenting himself over Bella. Meanwhile, red hues infiltrate the screen to show the rage and heartache that his acting clearly could not.
The film gets better — note the sarcasm. What starts out as a teenage love story quickly turns into a grotesque and poorly depicted horror film. As if Stewart’s acting was not painful enough, Bella’s discolored, bruised, shrinking skin inflicted by her hybrid human-vampire baby is simply unpleasant to watch.
The birth scene epitomizes this abhorrent attempt at horror. Superfluous blood, Bella’s nauseating appearance and another montage do not speak to the extreme pain she experiences but make viewers uneasy.
Some of these flaws could have gone unnoticed, but the melodramatic soundtrack amplifies the abominable acting and apathetic plot line. The film lacks an appropriate dispersal of the dramatic, violin-heavy score. Every moment, be it a love scene or Bella demonstrating her stubbornness, loses its value through the score’s excessiveness.
The only thing Breaking Dawn has going for it is the attractive leads and coherent plotline; even if it’s awful and you feel indifferent toward the characters, the plot is at the very least comprehensible. It sounds harsh, but it’s hard to find any legitimate redeeming qualities. You can’t even laugh at how horrible Breaking Dawn is simply because it’s just too agonizing to watch.
In all seriousness, your $15 would be better spent on other notoriously horrible movies, such as From Justin to Kelly, Glitter or Showgirls.
I agree with most everything the ‘critic’ has said about this awful film, except one point. It’s “exploitation of sex”? Really? Did I miss something? Was there full nudity in this movie?
The couple kisses (uh yes, quite a bit – they’re newly weds) and cuddle in bed. But guess what? They’re married.
Bella and Edward’s disgusting lust? I must have missed that one also.
If you want to talk about true sexual exploitation, go watch “Toddlers and Tiara’s”
To me that is far more ‘heinous,’ exploitave and disturbing than this awkward, wooden film. And Skylar, what gives you the audacity to attack another person like that? Try giving an intelligent, constructive comment (proper punctuation wouldn’t hurt either) when you don’t agree with someone – instead of making sweeping generalizations and assumptions about their character. Grow up.
DUDE WHAT THE FUCK???? WERE YOU STONED WHEN YOU WROTE THIS?..  you must have been smoking a cheap ass weed then… Twilight is the best thing that ever happened to me, if it’s not because ot Twilight, I probably dead by now in depression.. Look where I am now, in a much much better place.. Thanks to Twilight..
Apparently, your the one who’s been smoking the cheap ass weed since you love poorly made crap like ‘Breaking Dawn’.
OMG did you read the book??? I think this is the worst and most biased review ever. Soft porn seriously are you that conservative, go watch a Dutch or European movie and than go back to you film criticisms. The amount of abs showed didn’t even come close to what the book describes…BTW Bella is supposed to look horrible so what is your problem. A dying person should look horrible yes if not you probably would have had your comments anyway.
 I think it is too easy to hate on a successful franchise, this is for the fans, the fans love it and if you are so angry don’t watch these movies anymore!
Jan- I agree with you completely, the review was spot-on and as a fan of the book, i found the movie to be repulsing and cliché. (as the past three films have been as well- what a surprise.)
Adrian- obviously she is not speaking for all fans, it’s a fucking REVIEW from HER opinion (clearly it will be biased). plus who are you to assume she didn’t read/didn’t like the books? clearly you seem like a a sexually frustrated and insecure teenager who gets off by watching this “soft-core porn” by your childlike response and obsession with these books. sadly, it’s people like you in the world who are turning your generation into mindless and pathetic readers and movie-goers who don’t understand the true meaning of a “quality” book/film. 
don’t defend this movie ever again. i’m saving you from a lifetime of embarrassment.
Adrian – did you see the movie?  I’m guessing not.  I am a huge fan of the books and I also saw the movie today – this review was SPOT ON.  The movie was horrific on so many levels….I will not see the second half.
Low expectations says who???  You??  I am sure you are not speaking for all the fans for sure.  What a lame article with a bias perspective from a critic who I am sure didn’t even read the book.  Now, if you read the book, then you should know that the movie was suppose to be gory.  In the book, Bella gets married, gets pregnant, there is lots of blood, and sex.  Twilight fans were expecting the books perspective within the movie.  I know why you are just talking your butt off, it is because you just don’t like the twilight books.
