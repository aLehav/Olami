Nothing can be taken for granted when a team has everything to prove. That is the mindset the USC football team holds halfway through its spring practice schedule. 
All USC teams are talented, but this one faces the monumental task of making fans forget about the team’s frustrating 2018 campaign. The defense in particular has a lot of questions to answer: The unit lost four major contributors from 2018 in linebackers Porter Gustin and Cam Smith, cornerback Iman Marshall and safety Marvell Tell.
The team is dealing with particular challenges replacing those last two players, however. The Trojans are dealing with injuries to sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin (shoulder) and sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga (collarbone), both of whom were poised to get significant playing time in the defensive backfield. Even freshman cornerback Max Williams is currently unavailable as he recovers from a knee injury that ended his senior season of high school.
All three are expected to be ready for the regular season, however, and their absence gives inexperienced or forgotten players the chance to showcase their skills against a talented group of Trojan receivers.
“I just like working against whoever steps up,” said redshirt freshman cornerback Isaac Taylor-Stuart, a highly-ranked recruit who missed much of last season due to injuries. “I like working with [senior Michael] Pitt[man], [redshirt-junior] Tyler Vaughns, [sophomore] Amon-ra St. Brown — it doesn’t matter who steps up. As long as I work and get better, that’s all that matters.”
The injuries have forced the remaining defensive backs to fill in at every position in the secondary, which can be mentally and physically tiring but also rewarding.
“Honestly, it helps us more because we’re able to learn more positions on the field and get used to playing inside and outside instead of corner sticking to corner, safety sticking to safety,” said redshirt freshman cornerback Chase Williams. “It helps us all to learn every position on the field and, at the end of the day, it gets our conditioning up.”
Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said putting players at multiple positions helps the coaches as well as the players.
“When you’re teaching the defense, when you’re putting it in in the spring, trying to find out what guys do best, what gives them the best opportunity not only for the team but for them as well, you have to kind of mix and match,” Pendergast said.
Taylor-Stuart and Williams said their work with defensive backs coach Greg Burns helped them pick up the slack.
“He’s super detailed, he gets down to the real nitty-gritty stuff and he pushes us,” Williams said. “Each day, he gets more and more intense, but at the same time, he stays on the fundamentals. He continues to have us repeat the same drills, the same techniques because they transfer to the field.” 
Taylor-Stuart echoed Burns’ philosophy of emphasizing on proper technique, especially when it came to physicality with receivers.
“The technique as a corner is very important, especially getting your hands on them, stopping them from running their route, making it a lot tougher for the [quarterback] to make the throws,” Taylor-Stuart said.
With young players stepping up, Burns said he didn’t care who emerged as a leader, just that they communicate.
“What I want is a bunch of leadership,” Burns said. “Even the freshman [are] communicating, being boisterous about situations and encouraging each other. I think we have a crop of leaders, not just in the secondary but on the defensive side.”
The other areas of the defense have had a bit more luck healthwise. Pendergast said he has liked what he has seen from the defensive line and inside linebackers.
“The defensive line has been probably the most impressive, just with their techniques up front,” Pendergast said. “The inside linebacker position with the young guys has been fun to watch. They’ve really picked up their ability to blitz inside.”
As the team continues to grow, they haven’t forgotten last season’s emotions.
“We want to come out and dominate and compete every day,” redshirt sophomore defensive lineman Marlon Tuipulotu said of his position group. “We want to hold ourselves to a higher standard than we did last season because we felt we didn’t do what we were supposed to.”
Taylor-Stuart said he has liked the team’s energy as spring ball has progressed.
We’re a lot more competitive,” he said. “We know what losing feels like, and we don’t want to lose anymore. If we just have that winning mentality, not thinking about losing but only getting better … we just keep winning like that.

The Trojans defeated Long Beach State 8-5 in 10 innings at Blair Field Stadium in Long Beach Tuesday night. 
Both teams were looking to bounce back after disappointing weekend performances. The Trojans dropped all three of their weekend games on the road against Washington, while Cal State Fullerton swept the Dirtbags in Long Beach.  
The match was the second meeting between the two teams this season, as the Trojans relied on hot bats and a strong performance from their bullpen to beat the Dirtbags 5-2 in their first meeting at Dedeaux Field last week. 
After an uneventful first inning, USC jumped ahead to a 4-run lead at the top of the second inning. The offensive surge began early in the frame when sophomore infielder Ben Ramirez drove a leadoff double to right center field. Freshman catcher Tyler Lozona followed Ramirez’s hit with with a sacrifice bunt to advance Ramirez to third base. 
The inning only worsened from there for the Dirtbags. Redshirt sophomore pitcher Matt Fields couldn’t find the strike zone and walked three Trojans in a row to push Ramirez across home plate, making the score 1-0 USC.
Long Beach opted to sub in junior pitcher Zak Baayoun during the middle of the second, but the Dirtbags’ luck did not change. 
With the bases loaded, junior outfielder Brady Shockey singled to left center field to push Trojans senior infielder Brandon Perez and freshman outfielder Preston Hartsell across home for his fifth and sixth RBI of the season. Shockey’s hit extended the Trojans’ lead to 3 runs. 
Before the frame ended, senior infielder Chase Bushor tacked on 1 more run for the Trojans with a sacrifice fly to advance junior infielder John Thomas and gave USC a 4-0 lead entering the bottom of the second frame. 
In the third inning, Long Beach’s fortunes began to change. Baayoun retired three Trojans in order for a 1-2-3 inning. At the bottom of the frame, the Dirtbags cut their deficit to three after a double by junior outfielder Calvin Estrada flew over the heads of USC junior pitcher Gus Culpo and senior infielder Brandon Perez to push a Dirtbag home. 
Entering the fourth inning, USC looked to build on a 4-1 lead. But Long Beach’s lineup caught fire during the bottom half of the frame, and a two-out rally made the prospect of a comeback became very real for the Dirtbags. 
The rally began when senior outfielder Brooks Stotler hit an RBI triple over center field to score 2 for the Dirtbags and cut their deficit to 1. Estrada immediately followed up with an RBI single to score Stotle and tie the game 4-4. 
Both teams struggled offensively throughout the next four frames. After giving up the lead in the fourth, sophomore pitcher John Beller settled in and threw four scoreless innings for the Trojans. Beller finished the game having allowed only six hits over five innings pitched before junior pitcher Chris Clarke took over for the game’s final frames. 
At the top of the ninth with the bases loaded, Ramirez lined up a Dirtbags fastball to left field to score Chase Bushor and give the Trojans a 5-4 lead. Long Beach attempted to limit the damage after giving up the lead but entered the bottom of the frame looking for an answer.
Freshman infielder Tyler Porter provided just that, with a clutch RBI single to push Estrada home and send the game into extra innings. 
In the 10th frame, the bases were loaded once again for USC when junior pitcher CJ Stubbs lined up a bases-clearing RBI triple to score three Trojans and give USC a 3-run lead. Clarke closed out the final frame to secure the win 8-5. 
“I thought it was a great team win,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said in an interview with USC Athletics. “If you don’t love playing these types of games — where it’s tied in the ninth and you got a chance to win — then you’re playing the wrong sport.” 
After this much-needed win, the Trojans look ahead to a home series against No. 1 UCLA. At the two team’s last contest in early March, the Bruins beat the Trojans 7-5. The series’ first pitch is 7 p.m. Friday at Dedeaux Field.

After achieving a decisive victory two weeks ago in their first game under interim head coach Casey Moon, the No. 1 USC women’s water polo team seeks to extend its undefeated streak to 37 games when it takes on No. 2 Stanford Saturday.
The Cardinal are 14-1 this season, with their only loss being against USC in the Barbara Kalbus Invitational championship match earlier this season. Although the Trojans have prevailed in their last four games against the Cardinal, the team is preparing harder than ever for this weekend to counter Stanford’s strength on both ends of the pool.
Stanford’s offensive firepower poses a threat to any opponent. The Cardinal’s 17.43 goals per game leads the MPSF by a considerable margin, with USC as the second leading scorer at 14.70 goals per game. Stanford also boasts seven of the top 25 scorers in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, while only three USC players have achieved the same rank. The Trojan defense should be especially wary of junior driver Makenzie Fischer, whose 3.92 goals per game tops the MPSF.
“Trying to stop their top shooters and trying to slow down their fast break [are] the biggest [priorities] because they’re really good in the counter, and they have some good shooters,” senior captain and goalie Amanda Longan said. “Especially [Fischer]. She’s got a sniper on her, so we have to make sure we rule those [shooters] out.”
Fortunately for the Trojans, Longan is having a stellar season in goal, giving up just 3.86 goals per game while averaging 10.95 saves. In conjunction with her philosophy to lead by example, Longan also plays an important role in keeping her teammates’ intensity high.
“Obviously, I hope I can stop all the shots that come my way, but I hope I can keep our spirits high throughout the game, more importantly,” Longan said. “And regardless of how the game goes, I can help keep the team moving forward. That’s the biggest concern for me right now: keeping our spirits up and keeping us motivated to go, go, go regardless of how the score looks.”
Maintaining this sense of unity was important for the team these past couple of weeks after the unexpected termination of head coach Jovan Vavic for his alleged involvement in the college admissions bribery scheme. Vavic had led the women’s water polo program at USC since its inception. Despite staffing changes, the Trojans are back to business as usual and are preparing to face Stanford with heightened intensity under Moon’s leadership.
“The preparation is all the same because Casey was taught by Jovan and everything we’ve done around here has been with Casey as well,” Longan said. “If anything, we’re making sure we’re a lot more dialed in and more accountable for knowing our responsibilities and knowing the strengths and weaknesses of us and Stanford.”
Along with consistent leaders like Longan and senior co-captain and  driver Courtney Fahey, the new crop of Trojans has yielded several standouts this season, including freshman two-meter Alejandra Aznar. Aznar garnered her second MPSF Newcomer of the Week award following the Trojans’ last game against Hawaii, in which she scored twice and earned a penalty shot for her team. Aznar and the Trojans’ other young talent will need to contribute to the Trojans’ scoring efforts Saturday in order to counter Stanford’s potent offense.
Saturday’s MPSF duel will take place 2 p.m. at Uytengsu Aquatic Center. After that, the competition remains stiff as the Trojans travel to take on Cal next weekend.

The horrific image of Los Angeles Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman obliterating New Orleans Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis in the 2018 NFC Championship game may never leave Saints fans’ minds. However, a new rule that will be implemented in the 2019 season may prevent fans from ever having to go through that emotional distress again. 
The missed pass interference call is now known as one of the biggest botched calls in NFL history, right up there with former Lions receiver Calvin Johnson’s “dropped” touchdown reception, which was actually a catch. This play cost the Saints a Super Bowl appearance, and fans will never forget that.
Die-hard Saints fans protested the NFL and called out Commissioner Roger Goodell. Two season-ticket holders from “Who-Dat Nation” even filed a lawsuit against the NFL.
It’s unfair. The call clearly was pass interference — anyone with common sense can see that. It is just unfortunate that in that moment, the officiating crew lacked common sense. 
As a result, all 32 NFL head coaches voted unanimously to extend the replay rule to allow for pass interference calls to be challenged by coaches and reviewed in New York in the last two minutes of each half. 
This is a big step for the NFL, which hasn’t allowed coaches to challenge penalties in the past. It will surely allow the NFL to make better calls in some instances. However, the negative ramifications of the newly implemented rule far outweigh its benefits. 
 Take the catch rule, for example. Each year, the NFL tries to redefine what is considered a “catch.” The player must make a football move, secure control and clear possession. 
The thought of hearing these words come out of Mike Pereira’s mouth on Sunday makes me uneasy. There is no definite answer. It is not his fault; there is virtually no way to eliminate the massive gray zone in the catch rules. 
Because of this, replay reviews on potential receptions were some of the NFL’s most controversial plays in recent memory.
The same goes for pass interference calls. The 2018 NFL rulebook defines pass interference as “any act by a player more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage [that] significantly hinders an eligible player’s opportunity to catch the ball.”
There are bullet points that  help define this rule in Section 5 Article 2 of the NFL Rulebook, but that will never be enough to eliminate the gray area left by the imperfect rules. I expect to see some long reviews on pass interference calls. I expect to see Pereira attempt to define the ambiguous grey zone. And I expect to see tweets from furious fans about a play standing or being overturned. 
 Undoubtedly, the implementation of this rule will benefit the NFL. It releases the handcuffs that have prevented officials from reviewing penalty calls. Referees are humans, and humans make mistakes, especially in fast-paced environments where they must make snap decisions. It is sensible to think that with the technology available today, officials should have the opportunity to make the correct call through review. 
However, slowing the game down and staring at negligible details for a couple minutes often cause officials to second guess themselves in these grey zone areas. They were trained for years to make the right call on the field. Some things should not be reviewed and especially should not be challenged by coaches.
A similar argument can be made for balls and strikes in baseball. The umpire calls it on the field, and that’s the way it is. Sometimes, calls are missed. No umpire will ever say they make 100 percent of their calls correctly. Introducing reviews for balls and strikes would be detrimental to the game. Granted, the right call would most likely be made when reviewed — every aspect of a sport cannot be perfect.
I would be open to a rule that states NFL coaches can’t challenge penalties, but officials are allowed to review plays for penalties, if they think a call was botched or even New York-initiated reviews. Allowing coaches to challenge calls adds a whole different dimension to the plays that are reviewed. It introduces more plays that can essentially be decided by the flip of a coin.

“They want me to come in tomorrow for an interview. I have no idea what to wear!” 
As someone who stresses about every detail of a job or internship interview, moving to L.A., where trendy workplace outfits are common, placed stress on me and my wardrobe. While I love the internship and job opportunities available in L.A., finding the right outfit for the interview can be daunting at best and a complete disaster at worst.
I grew up in a small, traditional town in Rhode Island, which led me to assume that dressing for an interview meant putting on my business formal best. While this is far from the case when navigating the competitive job market in Los Angeles where internships allow greater fashion freedom, opting for a classic business suit did make dressing for work and interviews much easier. 
Although I’ve completed two internships, I recently encountered an unexpected situation when I interviewed for a position at a bank in downtown Los Angeles. I had never before encountered a position where wearing jeans to work was not acceptable or encouraged. Through this, I realized that the industry you work in can impact your wardrobe preferences as much as the physical location. 
While dressing for my previous positions was not much different from dressing for class, the new challenge showed me not only how business attire has certainly expanded but also how many other industries (and society at large) may or may not accept those changes. With the plethora of stores now stocking business clothing such as Aritzia, J. Crew and even athletic wear companies like Lululemon marketing work pants, purchasing clothing for a new job or internship is now more exciting and fashionable than ever. 
However, in fields like law or medicine, where traditional and stringent dress codes are necessary for professionalism and safety, expressing one’s personal style at work can be quite challenging. Fashion has not greatly expanded to accommodate certain industries, but there is room for it to do so by finding more innovative and stylish ways to support people in these fields. At the same time, many people in these industries have found creative ways to help combat the societal norms that are imposed on certain careers through small jewelry or hair accessories. 
Despite the rigid norms set by different industries, creative people still manage to let their personal style shine. Although I love the freedom that comes with more relaxed dress codes in Los Angeles workplaces, it is interesting to see the expansion of business formal past simple black and white suits. Shopping for this type of clothing on a budget will definitely pose an additional challenge that I will have to face along with many of my peers at USC when we leave the relaxed L.A. dress code bubble and either change industries or move to a new city. No matter the industry, I know that fellow fashionistas will find a great way to showcase their personal style through even the smallest details.

Classical vocalist and composer Mija brought a new experience for her fans to The Echo Wednesday night highlighting her abilities as a musician. 
Mija (Amber Giles) is known for her creative efforts as an electronic music producer and DJ. However, her first-ever live tour, aptly titled “Band Practice,” is new territory for the performer, as she exchanges her turntables for a microphone and loop pedal. 
Opening for Mija was Arthur Anderson (Sam Anderson), a cellist and producer who previously released two albums under the pseudonym Arkomo. To start his set, Anderson easily blended his cello with contemporary electronic equipment. The experimentation worked and Anderson maintained a smooth groove, as he would use his loop pedal to create understated cello notes. 
Throughout his set, Anderson would occasionally lay down vocals over looping tracks from his launch pad and loop pedal. Before closing out his set, Anderson played his own cello arrangement of a piano arrangement by Russian composer Alexander Scriabin. To do this, Anderson used his loop pedal and played a section one by one, adding three additional layers on top of the foundation first loop, finishing to rousing applause. Anderson was the perfect opener for Mija, as his set previewed an essential concept of her tour: the blend of live instrumentation and electronica.
Following his performance, Mija and her bandmates came out with a robust, ominous and twisted composition of electronic music fragmented by Mija’s spoken word poetry. In this moment, the stage design came to life. Surrounded by lamps and lightbulbs flickering to beat of her music, Mija provided a fitting stage reminiscent of a garage — the kind where multifaceted, talented musicians come together and improvise a jam session.
“This show is different every night,” Mija explained to the crowd. “It’s band practice.” 
Throughout her set, Mija would use the loop pedal to create vocal layers on top of her initial vocal melody. Mija demonstrated the clarity of her voice through the construction of beautiful vocal layers, but the set sometimes suffered because the improvisational approach limited her talent. She often repeated phrases like “I want to turn you on” or “cover me so I can nap” throughout segments of her set and, although interesting the first few times, the phrases dragged on much longer than they should have. 
Another recurring problem throughout the show was the sound; Ryan Forever, Mija’s bandmate who performed alongside her and engineer, constantly signaled for the sound to be raised without any response. Despite the technical problems that occurred throughout the show, Mija seemed unphased.

Few stories have captured the public’s imagination for as long as Roald Dahl’s “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” has. The now-universal tale first appeared on bookshelves in 1964 and has been adapted into two films and a musical that debuted on Broadway in 2014 and premiered at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre Wednesday. 
The story follows Charlie Bucket, a prepubescent fanatic of Wonka’s famous chocolate and an effervescent dreamer living in a household where rotten cabbage soup is a luxury. But right from the beginning, we learn that despite their extreme poverty, Charlie loves his family — he’s willing to buy them dinner instead of his yearly chocolate bar, and his dreamy letter to Wonka reveals that his true greatest desire is for his family to have everything they’ve ever wanted. In his most endearing wish, he writes to Wonka that he should create “an ice cream that would never melt, so she [Charlie’s mother] could feel all day the way I wish she always felt.”
Opening night saw a delightful Rueby Wood as Charlie, but the ensemble was led by Noah Weisberg in the titular Wonka role. Actors must be able to keep their audience entertained at every second; such pressure is only doubled when taking on Willy Wonka, a role meant to ignite maximum audience curiosity. Weisberg’s eccentric execution of the iconic candyman was rarely domineering and exemplified a humble chemistry toward his fellow producers; the result was a show that truly felt like a team effort. Every cast member was indispensable — each zany and heartfelt performance in tune with the rest of the production.
The story begins by introducing the Bucket family, Wonka (disguised as a local candy shop owner) and the four diabolical children who beat Charlie to the first Golden Tickets. The greatest laughs come in a sequence where the incognito Wonka watches the news with Charlie as the winners roll in; it’s an unrelenting series of quick tunes that range from a German yodel to a hip-hop dance break. This constant shift in tones banishes all boredom while playfully (although at times rather simplistically) introducing the audience to each child’s mortal sin. Dropped in between these tunes are snippets of Charlie’s everyday life, juxtaposing him with the gluttony of Augustus Gloop, the greed of Veruca Salt, the pride of Violet Beauregarde and the sloth of Mike Teavee. 
In some sense, Roald Dahl’s story is meant to be a straightforward tale of the meek inheriting the earth (and, consequently, the wicked not). It doesn’t beg for depth in its supporting cast — not even in Mr. Wonka — since it’s centerpiece is Charlie and his family. The musical’s quick pace, although quite the fun and a heartwarming experience, spurs the audience to sympathize with Charlie. But while his angelic qualities are explored more in the first act, they are buried in the sheer absurdism of the second. 
The climax of the entire show comes in the entire second act, as the children are speedily welcomed and dismissed from the chocolate factory. Writer David Grieg’s musical iteration of the Dahl classic is not ashamed of embracing his absurd premise and imagery; the second act runs straight through the various setpieces in Wonka’s factory at a lightning speed that leaves the audience just enough time to mirror Mr. Salt’s dumbfounded reaction to his daughter being taken away by sentient squirrels. 
Elevated by Tony Award-winner Marc Shaiman’s fantastic score, “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” is ultimately a fascinating experience for all ages; bright colors and big personalities command the audience, leaving no dull moments and countless melodies stuck in their heads.

Of the 11 state holidays that California recognizes, USC acknowledges and incorporates all but one into its academic calendar: César Chávez Day, which falls on March 31. The University has a plaque in Founder’s Park commemorating his achievements, but other than this meager monument, little has been done to honor his legacy. 
With César Chávez Day approaching this Sunday, the University should reflect on Chávez’s legacy — one that emphasizes a commitment to hard work and perseverance. He carried out the first successful attempt at unionizing farm workers, creating the United Farm Workers of America with activist Dolores Huerta in 1962. Under their guidance, the union successfully unionized the grape industry with strikes, pickets and boycotts, including the Delano Grape Strike and a march from Delano to Sacramento. 
Prior to Chávez’s leadership, farm workers had little to no rights and no means to fight for basic needs like clean drinking water. His work is expansive and impactful, and his legacy should be celebrated as such by USC.
In his later years, Chávez visited the University Park Campus on three separate occasions in 1982, 1985 and 1989. Although he only had a middle school education and worked as a migrant worker, he saw education as a tool for progress, his eldest son Fernando said in a speech at USC in 2016, the Daily Trojan reported. Chávez also sought to educate the American public about where their food came from, explaining that the farm workers that grew food for the American populace were not able to afford the food, largely because of a denial of basic working conditions and rights that are commonly taken for granted.
Perhaps USC has not recognized César Chávez Day in its academic calendar because of scheduling concerns, since the holiday  falls relatively close to the University’s spring recess. But UCLA observes César Chávez Day, which falls even closer to its spring recess than USC’s. All schools in the University of California system are mandated by state law to observe the holiday, and Claremont McKenna College, a private institution like USC, even commemorates the holiday. Although many other California private schools cite spring recess as an issue, César Chávez Day should be observed across all institutions, public and private, spring recess or not.
Some may belittle setting aside an entire day to commemorate César Chávez as an attempt to obtain an extra day off from  school or work. Ideas like these are cursory oversights of the immense legacy that Chávez has left behind, which ranges from advocating for minority rights to changing the way that fruits and vegetables reach the dinner table in millions of households nationwide. Former President Barack Obama addressed this succinctly when commemorating César Chávez Day in 2012.
“I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate service, community and education programs to honor Cesar Chavez’s enduring legacy,” Obama said according to White House archives.
Furthermore, it is not only a matter of acknowledging Chávez’s impact but also a matter of honoring those that work in the fields for hours upon end, bringing food to millions of Americans nationwide with little thanks or recognition. There’s an estimated three million migrant and seasonal farm workers in the U.S. — although they support a multi-billion dollar agricultural industry, these men and women are often still subject to unfair wages, sexual harassment, dangerous work and living conditions. 
Located in a state where migrant farms workers have had a significant influence on culture and economy, USC is in a position to lead by example. Nearly 15 percent of USC students are Latinx, and as such, it is important for the University to step up by engaging with the nearly 30 Latinx related undergraduate organizations under the supervision of El Centro Chicano, according to its website. By directing this engagement through either the Latinx Student Assembly or the Diversity Affairs branch of Undergraduate Student Government, change and advocacy initiatives can be put in the hands of students — whether it is through hosting prominent Latinx speakers or community events.
USC should follow the example set by other universities nationally in acknowledging the legacy of a leader as impactful as Chávez by doing more than just having a relatively unnoticeable plaque honoring him. By acknowledging César Chávez Day, the faculty, staff, administration and students of USC can appropriately remember and celebrate Chávez’s life and work, emulating him by building communal relationships while learning about the importance of the Hispanic civil rights movement.

“These are issues of life and death.”
Ainsley Carry recalls hearing this phrase back in early 2016 when he first started listening to students share their experiences at USC. As Vice President for Student Affairs, Carry helped lead the Provost’s then-newly established Diversity Task Force, which held roundtable discussions open to the University community every two weeks. And the responses they got revealed that students did not feel like they belonged at USC. 
“Initially I thought to myself, [that phrase] may be overdramatizing it,” said Carry, who came to USC from Auburn University in 2013. “But as I continued to listen to the students, they were sharing pain. They were talking about, ‘I don’t feel like I belong here. I’m scared to go out at night. I can’t concentrate in class because I was called a certain name, or a faculty member used my race as an example in a session.’”
Based on these discussions, Carry and the rest of the task force realized that the gaps in inclusion on campus posed health issues that required immediate action.
“When a person doesn’t feel like they belong or don’t feel connected or feel marginalized, that impacts their health, and then their study habits, eating habits to sleeping habits,” Carry said.
According to the Provost’s website, the Vice President for Student Affairs is responsible for supporting students through his campus-wide initiatives. While his goals were centered on cultivating student support and advocacy, promoting student involvement and creating educational experiences outside of the classroom, Carry’s biggest priority was to make USC the healthiest campus in America.
On Dec. 4, Carry announced he would leave USC to become the Vice President for Students at the University of British Columbia in an email to the community. His appointment will begin April 1. 
“Students are the heart of USC, and walking across campus with Ainsley shows how much of a personal connection he’s forged with them — they stop him every few steps,” Provost Michael Quick wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Thanks to his work with Residential Education programs and his drive to heighten the student experience all across USC, Ainsley will leave a lasting legacy of deep engagement with and care for our students.”
For public health
In his six years at USC, Carry placed equity, diversity and inequity at the forefront of his agenda. After holding the diversity forums and round table discussions, Carry aimed to improve the campus culture for students. 
“When we start to think about diversity and inclusion as a public health matter, it changes the types of solutions that we start to perceive and think about,” Carry said. “That’s been an important area of progress.”
That year, in response to student protests at colleges across the nation including USC, Carry established the Diversity Task Force. He worked with the task force to expand cultural spaces and hire people to staff them. And to increase transparency, Quick required all USC schools to make the their faculty demographics available online. Each school also established a diversity liaison who would be responsible for improving the diversity within their school through a five-year plan. 
According to Carry, students also wanted to enforce mandatory diversity education. As a result, members of the task force, along with student leaders and the Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, began developing a one-unit course titled “THRIVE: Foundations of Well-Being” to advise students on wellness skills ranging from stress management to sustainability.
“There are 50 topics that are important when you get to USC,” Carry said. “There’s so many things that people care about. Equity, diversity and inclusion weren’t the only ones, so the class has a number of components in that space.”
Carry said members of the task force took on the “daunting” request for mandatory diversity education to enforce diversity training and initiatives through Residential Education. Resident assistants now undergo required training on social justice and diversity before they are able to conduct programs.
“What we wanted to do was say, as part of the residential community, let’s trip in our position around equity, diversity and inclusion so that as part of the living experience, they can be engaged with that,” Carry said. 
Additionally, Carry worked with the Undergraduate Student Government to set requirements for executive board members of registered student organizations to go through training on matters of diversity. 
Aside from diversity initiatives, Carry also led the implementation of USC Student Health’s Collective Impact Plan, a new cross-sector strategy that promotes shared governance and stakeholder input as a means of improving overall campus well-being. 
In light of lawsuits against USC and former campus gynecologist George Tyndall for his decades of alleged sexual abuse of patients, the Office of Healthy Promotion Strategy has served as the “backbone” of the plan, which aims to cultivate four pillars: equity and inclusion, individual and communal well-being, substance abuse prevention and healthy relationships.
Despite backlash that the plan fails to support minority groups, USC is one of the first universities in the nation to adopt the plan campus-wide. As such, much is still unknown about Collective Impact. 
“I wouldn’t say mission accomplished on that topic yet,” Carry said. “It’s ongoing, constant work. But we did a lot to start the momentum of moving that ball forward.”
Restructuring Greek life
When Carry and members of the task force were building the first-year wellness seminar course, they conducted analyses across schools and departments to evaluate the first-year experience at USC. 
“As we went around and met with different types of students and different groups of students, the things we were promoting as the Trojan experience were not acceptable to all,” Carry said. “So depending on what you join and who you are related to, you had access to different things.”
Students brought up the rigor of pledging Greek life organizations, an issue Carry’s predecessors also attempted to address. 
Faculty members notified Carry that groups of male students fall asleep in early morning classes every semester — and most of the time, they are pledging fraternities. According to Carry, parents also expressed concerns that freshmen feel pressured to join fraternities and sororities immediately and asked if the University could amend Greek life, so students could properly adjust to college.
“We were just hearing from parents, current students, former students about the rigor of going through this process in their very first year,” Carry said. “So with our student leaders in Greek letter organizations, we brought the topic forward.”
In September 2017, Carry released a letter to the USC community officially instating new Greek recruitment requirements of a minimum USC GPA of 2.5 and 12 completed units for the Interfraternity and Panhellenic councils. These standards, which were made effective in Fall 2018, barred first-semester freshmen and new transfer students from joining Greek life in the fall. 
“I don’t want to create the impression that everybody jumped up and said, ‘Yes, let’s do this! Let’s require first-year students to shut out a semester,’” Carry said. “That wasn’t the spirit of it … [but] we have to think about the mental health and well-being of students in their first year of enrollment.”
In response to Carry’s letter, the Panhellenic Council expressed that it was ready to work closely and openly with the University to implement the changes. Meanwhile, IFC leadership released a letter opposing the decision, including a proposal for a public meeting with administration and non-binding mediation.
Carry said that in listening sessions he held with IFC and Panhellenic, members brought up concerns about how the decision would affect various facets of Greek life such as philanthropy due to financial losses from lack of recruitment. As a result, the administration met with IFC and Panhellenic to discuss their finances.
Another concern Carry attempted to address was hazing, especially in Greek organizations. When the administration receives a report of hazing, it conducts an investigation while it places the organization on an interim suspension. If the Office of Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards finds credible evidence, the organization will be sanctioned accordingly.
In the past year, five Greek organizations were investigated: Pi Kappa Phi, Theta Xi, Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Sigma Kappa and Sigma Alpha Mu. 
“[And] unfortunately, in the past two years, we’ve had to suspend quite a few organizations, and I’m not a fan of that,” Carry said. “I want healthy Greek communities on our campus or a better community where students have organizations to join and participate in … We cannot sacrifice a healthy Greek community for student health and wellness.”
Now, Carry said that he has received more reports, regarding hazing in campus organizations than before, including one dating back to 2015.
“The toughest challenge with any student groups is that they graduate, they move on, so the knowledge leaves, and you’ve got to re-educate the next year to say, ‘Hey, we want you to know that [hazing] is inappropriate,” Carry said. “So every year we have to be vigilant about keeping the education.”
Moving forward
On April 1, Carry will be appointed vice president for students at UBC. Carry said he is thrilled about USC President-elect Carol Folt’s ability to steer universities in the right direction.
“I can’t think of anybody more capable to lead us right now,” Carry said. “She has been through many of these things at University of North Carolina … She faced real pressure around monument removal on campus, so she understands how to run in a large organization and help us get better.”
Carry said he hopes to have left a legacy that gives the University the momentum to address critical issues across campus, but what he will miss most about USC — and is excited about at UBC — is engaging with the student body.
“Whether it’s at USC, Auburn, Arkansas or UBC, my commitment to the work is the engagement [with students], which is what energizes me,” Carry said. “That’s what keeps me going and is what keeps me coming back.”

The atmosphere in Tommy’s Place Thursday night was somber. One after another, students performed on stage by reciting personal writing and poetry in dedication to Victor McElhaney, a senior who died earlier this month from a gunshot wound after a failed robbery attempt.
The event is part of a monthly series and is co-sponsored by the Center for Education, Identity and Social Justice, Graduate Student Government, Undergraduate Student Government, Rossier Master’s Program Office and Residential Education.  
McElhaney was a musician and was an active member of the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and Brothers Breaking BREAD, a student organization founded to showcase black male leadership and excellence. He transferred to USC in Fall 2017 to pursue drumset studies at the Thornton School of Music. 
A memorial was held for McElhaney on March 19, where an estimated 700 people gathered at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom. 
Sarah Toutant, a CBCSA graduate assistant, led the open mic night. Before performers began, Toutant conducted a moment of silence for McElhaney. She later read a piece dedicated to McElhaney titled “The Definition of Drums,” which she also performed at his memorial.
“You were struck, and I should not be writing this poem right now. We should all not be here. Why are we here?” Toutant said in her poem. “But this poem will not answer our why, it will not bring us peace nor will it heal the open wounds filled with grief that your family feels, that your friends feel, that the world feels.”
Aside from performances dedicated to McElhaney, the event covered an assortment of topics, including gender dysmorphia, sexual assault, romantic encounters, grief and recent USC scandals. The night was open to the surrounding USC community, allowing local high school students and residents to participate. 
Graduate student Diana June Greer read a piece about McElhaney with her daughter Ariel. 
“If I had one wish, I would wish that humans could be bulletproof,” Greer recited. “You see everyone breaking down? Yeah, we’re going through it. So much anger in my soul, so much sadness fills up my heart … He was a leader. A young black man with big dreams.”
Students who attended the event stressed the importance of artistic expression on campus, especially through events like open mic nights. 
“I think it provides a safe space for students to come and express themselves in a non-formal classroom setting,” said Zehna Gilliam, a graduate student studying social work. 
Performer Edward Swan read Anthony Garcia’s poem, “I am the Time of Day and Life of All,”  which he dedicated to McElhaney. 
“We have a connection to people, and this space … allows people who haven’t even performed ever before an opportunity to speak on it,” Swan said. “Speak truth to power and this is one of those examples of that, where we can manifest wonderful energy by speaking on the microphone to others and having a message that is unique to ourselves.”
Toutant concluded the evening with a statement expressing gratitude to attendees and performers. 
“I really appreciate you all coming out tonight to commemorate Vic,” Toutant said. “I know that the energy was a little bit lower than it usually is, and I expected that, especially because a lot of us are feeling a lot right now and that’s very, very real. But thank you so much.”

Students, faculty members and The Office fans flooded the three floors of Bovard Auditorium Thursday night to see actor and businessman Rainn Wilson speak about the interplay of creativity, activism, education and spirituality through his acting and his digital media company SoulPancake, which was founded in 2008 to “chew on life’s big questions.” 
The event was coordinated by the USC Speakers Committee, the Academic Culture Assembly, Service Student Assembly, the Office of Religious Life and the School of Cinematic Arts. 
Wilson, who is best known for playing the eccentric salesman Dwight Schrute, said that while he loved acting, at the start of his career, he felt disconnected and unsatisfied because he felt “something big was missing.”
Wilson turned to his own spiritual journey, rediscovering his Bahá’í Faith — which is centered on the unity of God, religion and humanity — after rejecting it when he moved to New York City to pursue acting. 
“My parents had a house filled with ripe ideas,” Wilson said. “We had books on Buddhism, Hinduism … We had Jehovah’s Witnesses knocking on the door. My parents would invite them in and discuss the Bible with them and feed them pancakes. Rich ideas, really a great place to live.”
Once the workplace sitcom The Office grew in popularity in its second season in 2006, Wilson met with his friends, all members of the Bahá’í Faith, to found a grassroots movement that, according to Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni, “stimulates the brain and sparks the soul.” And thus, SoulPancake was born.
At the event, Wilson shared one story that was distributed through SoulPancake. Late teen singer Zach Sobiech, who garnered viral attention for his song “Clouds” in 2013, shared his experiences living his remaining days to the fullest after he found that his osteosarcoma was too advanced for treatment. 
“One of life’s largest questions is around the universal fear we all share that we will die,” Wilson said. “And as Zach Sobiech said, ‘You don’t have to find out that you’re dying to start living.’ So it’s just one of life’s big questions that we got to explore at SoulPancake.”
Wilson then sat down with Soni, who moderated the second half of the event. Soni asked about Wilson’s experiences on The Office and beyond. 
When he played Dwight, Wilson said he originally did not expect for the sitcom to take off in popularity as it did. However, he said that the show has embraced the “timeless quality” of family. 
“People have come up to me and said, ‘You’ve inspired me so much. I want to work in an office just like you,’ and it’s just like, oh God, you are kidding me!” Wilson said. “But I think every great TV show is about one thing — it’s about family. The Office created one of the quirkiest and most original but one of the most loving families out there.”
But when Wilson found himself gaining popularity in his 40s, he said he experienced a clash between achieving his celebrity status and prioritizing his spirituality. According to Wilson, becoming an actor can come from a deep-seeded insecurity of wanting to be noticed and liked. And since Wilson said his spiritual path is rooted in humility, service and gratitude, he has had to turn to prayer, meditation and therapy to find his place as a spiritual being.
“[Coming here,] I feel like the Beatles and the Pope all rolled into one,” Wilson said. “It fulfills the worst parts of me. The worst parts of me are my ego, my entitlement and my narcissism … It’s been an incredible spiritual challenge.”
Delving into the universal struggle of self-consciousness, Soni addressed the rise of the social media landscape. According to Soni, social media acts as a double-edged sword, creating a sense of loneliness and disconnection among users, a belief that Wilson supported. However, noting the “dark side” of social media, Wilson said he has used his platform as an actor to instill important movements that can reach wide audiences. 
“I’m whoring myself as Dwight to talk about some deep issues … and life’s biggest questions and what it means to be a human being and the spiritual energy that connects all of us,” Wilson said.
Montana Denton, a freshman majoring in public relations, said that while she did not expect Wilson to delve into his spiritual journey, she was able to learn more about Wilson as a person, not as the characters he played on the screen. 
“I think it was really cool how he used Dwight as a platform to talk about greater issues and all of the things he has accomplished since then that people do not normally recognize him for,” Denton said.

The Los Angeles Superior Court upheld the expulsion of former Gould School of Law student Claudine Tinsman Monday after a trial court granted her a writ of administrative mandamus challenging the University’s 2014 decision. According to the court opinion, Tinsman allegedly hacked another student’s computer to plagiarize documents for a law competition. 
In August 2014, Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards alleged Tinsman violated 11 different Student Conduct Code sections. The allegations said Tinsman submitted material authored by another student as her own and said she attempted to benefit from the work of another student by falsifying documents. 
The allegations came after Tinsman entered a law review competition in May 2014 and was accused of plagiarizing Gould student Irina Kirnosova’s “Bluebooking” exercise, which was meant to demonstrate the competition participant’s legal literacy, the opinion read. 
Tinsman appealed her expulsion to USC’s Student Behavior Appeals Panel in February 2015, claiming that her January diagnosis of bipolar disorder and psychosis warranted a re-examination of the decision. Tinsman submitted multiple documents to the panel, including letters from physicians and an MRI scan that showed a cyst pressing on her brain. 
“I realized that I had committed a grave error,” Tinsman wrote in a letter submitted to the panel, according to the opinion. “But the voices told me it was too late, that I was worthless, and the only way to avoid imprisonment was to continue the cover-up.” 
The three-person panel disposed of Tinsman’s appeal. According to the opinion, while the panel did not dispute the evidence submitted, none of it indicated that Tinsman was suffering from a mental illness at the time the violations occurred. 
In February 2016, Tinsman filed a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus, which would require the panel to review the new evidence for a second time. The petition was approved, and a court approved the writ in January 2017. The writ named USC, Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards official Donna Turner as defendants. USC did not appeal the writ. 
A new three-member panel reviewed the evidence again in February 2017 and upheld Tinsman’s expulsion. 
Tinsman appealed for a third time, this time to the California State Appeals Court, which affirmed the panel’s decision to uphold her expulsion in its opinion filed Monday. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC wrote that they were “pleased” with the Court of Appeal’s decision.
“USC takes academic integrity issues very seriously,” the statement read. 
Tinsman is currently a doctoral researcher in cybersecurity at the University of Oxford, according to Oxford’s website.

Concerned Faculty of USC, a group of nearly 350 staff and faculty members, released a statement regarding the recent alleged admissions bribery scheme. The group, led by Gould School of Law professor Ariela Gross, called on USC administrators to appoint a faculty-led oversight committee to investigate its admission and athletics departments following the University’s involvement in the FBI probe.
“Many of us were distressed to learn the news last week that USC is again at the center of a scandal involving corruption, greed and a failure of administrative oversight and accountability,” the statement read. “Of course, USC was not the only university involved in this criminal enterprise … but USC’s handling of past wrongdoing has engendered so much distrust in our community that we bear an extra burden to act on this case with the highest level of transparency, accountability and faculty governance.” 
Concerned Faculty started as an informal group in May 2018 after the Los Angeles Times reported on former campus gynecologist George Tyndall’s alleged abuse of current and former students. Concerned Faculty published a letter calling for former President C. L. Max Nikias to step down, which garnered support from over 200 faculty members. During the summer, the group created subcommittees to devise plans for faculty to help mend and advise the University following increased calls for transparency.
“We set up subcommittees on topics like long term governance, the presidential search and student health,” Gross said. “Those subcommittees were working all summer, both researching best practices and figuring out our own proposals for what should be done better at USC.” 
Almost one year later, Concerned Faculty took its first steps toward becoming a formal organization. Over 74 percent of the 350 active members recently participated in the election of a steering committee, which will lead and advise members.
“We’ve been operating this year as an informal group. We have had lots of people actively involved, but we didn’t have any formal structure,” Gross said. “But this month, we made the decision that it is really time to have a steering committee that is elected by membership.” 
The steering committee comprises eight faculty members including Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Larry Gross, Chair of Cinema and Media Studies Tara Mcpherson, Keck School of Medicine associate professor Sharon Orrange and Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences professors Manuel Pastor, Hilary Schor, Greg Thalmann and Jody Vallejo. 
In addition to calling for a faculty-led committee to investigate the recent alleged admissions scheme, the letter demands that the Board of Trustees release its findings from the internal investigations into former Keck dean Carmen Puliafito, who was accused of taking methamphetamines while seeing patients, and Tyndall, who is currently being accused by over 650 plaintiffs. 
Gross said she hopes Concerned Faculty can bring change to the University and inspire faculty to confront school-wide challenges. Gross said the University’s Academic Senate, the faculty’s representative body comprising elected Faculty Council members, is not as representative as some faculty would like.
“My overwhelming sense is just that this has … activated faculty who felt that there was just no point in getting involved in faculty governance because the traditional body, like the Academic Senate, had so little power,” Gross said. “The place where [the Senate] hasn’t changed … is to become more representative. They have the most arcane election procedures, so they have an executive board that does not represent their constituents.” 
Gross said that members of the steering committee engaged in productive conversation with President-elect Carol Folt in a meeting Wednesday. According to Gross, Folt expressed support for faculty involvement in the University’s internal investigation. 
Gross said Concerned Faculty hopes USC will continue to increase transparency.
“We call on all members of our community, including the administration and the Board of Trustees, to recommit ourselves to the academic and ethical values at the center of the University’s mission,” the statement read. “And to stop allowing important decisions to be driven by financial concerns as our paramount value.” 
USC did not respond to requests for comment at the time of publication.
