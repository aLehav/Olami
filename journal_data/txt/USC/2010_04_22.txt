Norman Corwin has been working longer than many people will live.
Corwin, currently the Annenberg Writer in Residence, began his career in journalism at age 17. On May 3, Corwin will celebrate his 100th birthday.
100 candles · Norman Corwin, Annenberg Writer in Residence, greets friends and admirers at Annenberg’s reception in honor of Corwin’s 100th birthday. About 65 people attended. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
About 65 people, including faculty members, former students and fans, gathered at Annenberg on Thursday to mark the occasion. It was only fitting, as Corwin said Annenberg is where he has had some of his best experiences.
“I’ve been at USC for 37 years; the entire experience has been my favorite memory,” Corwin said. “Teaching is my favorite achievement.”
Corwin began his career as a print journalist. After 10 years in the newspaper industry, Corwin emerged as a celebrated writer, director and producer for radio on CBS, hosting shows including “We Hold These Truths” and “On a Note of Triumph.”
“Corwin has been one of the great writers over the last 100 years,” said Geoff Cowan, an Annenberg professor and former dean of the school. “He elevated the level of discourse within this school and throughout the country.”
Friends, colleagues and former students shared memories of Corwin at the birthday party Thursday, swapping stories and discussing how Corwin affected their lives.
Hershl Hartman, the education director for the Sholem Community, a secular Jewish community in Los Angeles, said Corwin had a profound impact on him.
“I am now 80. He has inspired me since I was 14,” Hartman said. “For those few who know him personally, he brought radio from its sea of soap into a pantheon of American poetry.”
Hartman recounted a memory he had of Corwin as a teenager.
“In 1946, when I was 16, we turned on the radio to hear a broadcast hosted by the New York Herald Tribune,” said Hartman. “By the third word, my parents said, ‘that’s Paul Robeson speaking.’ By the second sentence, I said, ‘Those are Corwin’s words.’”
Joe Saltzman, an Annenberg professor, had a lot to share about his friendship with Corwin.
“I can see him directing one radio script after another,” Saltzman said. “But Corwin’s words are so unique that you know it’s him speaking after one sentence.”
Saltzman said he was responsible for asking Corwin to teach at USC. After Corwin attended the school, he said, he never looked back.
In his time at USC, Corwin had a profound impact on a number of students.
Lucy Lee, an Annenberg graduate in 1988 and one of Corwin’s students, was among the many students affected by Corwin.
“I represent the thousands of students that Norman has touched,” she said. “I’ve been his student all my life. He was one of the 10 people at my parents’ wedding.”
Lee remarked that his teaching style was unique.
“The power of praising students for what they do well is so potent. Norman is a master of celebrating what you do well,” she said.
Lee said people like Corwin will always be in demand.
“What’s missing from today’s journalism is the world context,” Lee said. “Norman is a student of the world. I think we lost some of that — to be observant of the world. That’s great journalism, and that’s Norman.”
Now, Lee works with Corwin as a member of the USC faculty.
“It has been my greatest privilege to be his colleague,” Lee said. “It’s been a great thrill for me.”
At the conclusion of the reception, Cowan read a letter from President Steven B. Sample congratulating Corwin on his lifelong accomplishments and contribution to the school.
“I was impressed,” Corwin said to the guests at the end of the reception, remarking on the comments from the speakers. “I couldn’t have written any of that better myself.”
Annenberg Dean Ernest Wilson delivered his own remarks to Corwin, summing up the impact of his legacy.
“Corwin’s work has always been associated with something we take seriously here at this school — great writing,” Wilson said. “Your insightful body of work has been ensured into the American consciousness. You are truly a literary treasure.”

USC’s Alumni Association student outreach program, Society 53, is hosting an event today featuring a USC graduate whose accomplishments have made history.
After graduating USC in 1986, Capt.  Melissa Ward became the first black woman to serve as a flight instructor in the U.S. Air Force and as a captain for a commercial airline. She attributes much of her success to USC.
“The big thing about USC is that the name recognition is incredible,” she said. “No matter where you live, when you go places in your life people are like, ‘Wow, that must have been a great place to go to school.’ For me it was really about what I learned on how to handle myself.”
As an undergraduate, the experiences Ward had at USC not only made for fond college memories but also served to teach her crucial lessons about hard work and perseverance that have helped her to realize her accomplishments.
“Everything I have done in life I think back and say I wouldn’t have been the same if I had not gone to USC. The friends I made are the ones I still have today,” Ward said.
Defining moments at USC came often for Ward, but the ones that stuck out most for her came on the court as a member of the USC women’s basketball team.
“It teaches you whole new things when you come from high school where you were the star, and then you are surrounded by people who are far better than you are,” she said. “It was very character developing to sit there and work so hard in practice, and the only reward was to know you made your best players better. I realized going into the Air Force that you have to do your part and things will come your way and you will eventually become the star.”
For current Trojans, becoming involved on campus and taking advantage of the non-academic opportunities is a must, according to Ward.
“Get involved in something,” she said. “If you can’t play on sports teams, play intramurals. Get involved in organizations. There is a lot to USC besides academics. Social skills are just as important as academic ones.”
Ward’s accomplishments are inspiring for not only Trojans but for other black women. Ward hopes her accomplishments give back to the community and help others accomplish their dreams.
“Black people are really tied up on firsts,” she said. “I think it’s super great in a culture where there were so many struggles, but I also think it’s important not to only mark the first. I just hope that when I look back that I am not the last one.”
Ward’s time at USC was full of accomplishments, both academic and personal. She graduated in the top 100 of her class, held the highest grade point average of any female athlete that year and won the Michael Garrett Award, according to Jessica Ching, a sophomore majoring in political science and a member of Society 53.
“She is also the recipient of the 77th annual USC alumni award. She is an amazing alumna and has achieved a lot and was nice enough to speak to the students,” Ching said.  
Society 53 President Lisa Robinson, a senior majoring in communication, said the group is excited to host Ward, and the event carries a special meaning as graduation approaches.
“She has an incredibly inspiring story, and she appeals to a wide group of people,” Robinson said. “I graduate in three weeks, so hearing an inspiring story from a fellow Trojan is very exciting for me.”

The new Undergraduate Student Government executive cabinet, introduced earlier this week, already has ambitious plans for a number of new projects, ranging from increasing outreach to making campus more sustainable.
Chief of Staff Maya Babla said USG is excited for the innovative ideas the new directors will bring.
“We’re going to build on past successes and evaluate issues that were started this year, as well as infusing new ideas and bringing fresh concepts to the table,” Babla said. “We’re going to get those new concepts by going back to students and asking their opinions.”
Director of Alumni Affairs Cindy Vuong has already begun compiling a list of alumni contacts from various student organizations around campus. She hopes to ultimately consolidate the information and create an alumni database. Though this will be done on a rolling basis, she hopes most of it will be completed by next fall.
“Alumni are a really good resource to have,” Vuong said. “They’re very valuable for things such as recommendations and different kinds of professional opportunities … A lot of students want more interaction with the alumni, but not all of them are aware of the events, discussions and panels that are held.”
Like Vuong, Director of Community Affairs Marissa Srour also hopes to increase awareness of what USC has to offer. Srour intends to continue to expand the Greater L.A. initiative, which sets up events that encourage and enable students to step off campus. Events this past year included day trips to gardens and museums as well as community service events. Srour said USG is expanding the program to include social issues that students might be interested in.
“We hope for more student input,” Srour said. “We want to continually collaborate with students.”
Director of Diversity Affairs Andrenna Hidalgo also encourages students to get more involved and said she will encourage the student body to come to office hours to learn more about what USG is doing.
Hidalgo’s goal for the upcoming year is to expand the definition of diversity so that it extends to the disabled students as well as transfer and commuter students.
“We want to help people who do not have a big enough voice on campus, whose needs are not being met,” Hidalgo said. “We want to work on their behalf.”
Director of University Affairs Tim Sae Koo said his main goal for the upcoming year is to create a bridge between last year’s goals and this year’s.
“A lot of projects can’t be finished in one year,” Sae Koo said. “So we’re going to have to check up on them and improve them.”
One project Sae Koo will be working on is improving sustainability. Beginning next year, the university will offer a reusable mug program. Mugs will be sold at a low price and allowed in the libraries. Each time a student makes a drink purchase on campus, he will receive a 10 percent discount.
Sae Koo is also looking into adding a “Lyon Cam” in the Lyon Center to monitor traffic. Students will be able to sit at home and watch Lyon Center activity online to see how busy the Lyon Center is. Although this project is still in its preliminary stages, Sae Koo said most of the feedback he has received is positive.
Similar to Sae Koo, Director of Campus Affairs Monish Tyagi also hopes to build upon projects from the previous administration as well as work on new ones.
Two things that he hopes to improve are increasing the hours of the L.A. Live tram and Campus Cruiser.
“We’re trying to figure out how to improve transportation options for students,” Tyagi said.
Tyagi also plans to address bike safety on campus and hopes to figure out how to streamline traffic around the new campus center. He also plans to test the blue light phones on campus and evaluate the distribution of CSC guards.
“We are continually working with [the Department of Public Safety] and figuring out how we can make things more safe for students,” Tyagi said.
Ravi Agarwal, the director of Academic Affairs, will be working on giving students a longer Thanksgiving break and making it an official school holiday. He will also be working with individual schools and departments to increase the number of two-unit classes offered and set up “language tables” where students can practice a foreign language without necessarily taking the class.
USG President Chris Cheng said he hopes the new executive cabinet will be actively involved around campus.
“Something that is going to be different is that [the directors] are going to be out there,” Cheng said. “Not just in their office hours but to actually work hands-on with the students to hear what they want and to do their best to accomplish those goals.”

It’s a good thing Alice got lost in Wonderland.
In 1865, British author Lewis Carroll debuted a world beneath a rabbit hole in which caterpillars smoke, flamingos serve as sporting equipment and nonsense is the norm. More than a century later, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland remains a literary staple with a far-reaching influence that has touched the worlds of art, fashion and, of course, filmmaking.
Looking glass · Students showcased Lewis Carroll-inspired creative works, including multimedia assemblages like the one above. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
To celebrate the uniqueness of Carroll’s whimsical stories and their continued impact on readers and writers from all walks of life, USC Libraries hosted an annual contest to generate original work inspired by the Carrollian canon. The sixth-annual Wonderland Award reception was held Wednesday in Doheny Memorial Library.
Contestants, eager to win one of the cash prizes offered, immersed themselves in Carroll’s whimsical writings and used the inspiration they gained to create works that included visual art, videos, board games and poetry.
Entries were due April 1, but it wasn’t until Wednesday that contestants, interested students and staff gathered to learn the outcome of the competition at the official awards ceremony. The event showcased the different talents of USC students from the undergraduate freshman level to the graduate student tier. Contestants’ majors ran the gamut from biological anthropology to electrical engineering.
Light classical music floated through the air, and tables with beige tablecloths were used to display the student submissions. Artist statements accompanying each submission described the creator’s inspiration.
“This is a special treat for the library and all of USC,” said Dean of USC Libraries Catherine Quinlan in her opening remarks at the awards ceremony.
The original idea behind the competition was to spur student interest in the assortment of rare Carroll-related items donated by USC alumnus George Cassady to Doheny library’s special collections.
The G. Edward Cassady, M.D. and Margaret Elizabeth Cassady, R.N. Lewis Carroll Collection contains more than 1,500 items including books and letters. In its six years, the competition has been remarkably successful in encouraging students to use the rare resources to come up with their own unique, artistic works.
Judges for this year’s contest included Linda Cassady, the award’s sponsor; Jim Kincaid, the Aerol Arnold Professor of English; last year’s winner Ghia Godfree; Carolyn Kellogg, a Los Angeles Times “jacket copy” blog editor; and Linda Woolverton and Suzanne Todd, screenwriter and producer, respectively, for Tim Burton’s 2010 adaptation of Alice in Wonderland.
To make the experience all the more fantastical, the prizes weren’t too shabby.
The first place submission received a cool $2,000 while the second place contestant left with $1,500.
The criteria for judgment included the use of the collection, the originality and overall quality of the work and the extent to which the submission captured the Carrollian spirit. For contestant Meagan Chin, a freshman majoring in fine arts, the competition involved no small amount of time and effort.
“It was my entire spring break,” Chin said with a laugh. She recalled that while her friends were knee-deep in partying, she was listening to National Public Radio while she painted.
At one point, she even gave up on her first painting and started a new one.
“You know halfway through when something doesn’t feel right,” Chin said.
The judges said it was the entrants’ close relationships with their craft that made their end products so interesting, unique and pleasing to behold.
“Hats off to all you for all your hard work,” Todd said in her address to the contestants. “Linda’s not kidding when she said we wanted to award everyone.”
Myra Yepez, a senior majoring in fine arts, took the White Knight Award for her large painting of Carroll while Genevieve Kaplan, a graduate student studying literature and creative writing, took second place for her small book entitled “Alice’s Alphabet: An Explanation,” which contained two long poems. It was her first time submitting work to the contest.
“I’ve thought of entering before,” Kaplan said. “I started on something for last year but didn’t enter.”
With her high qualifications — Kaplan holds a bachelor’s degree in creative writing as well as an MFA in poetry — it’s no wonder she took home a prize
Brandon Reynolds, a graduate student in the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, received the coveted first prize for his piece of short fiction, “Wonderland at Sunset: A Case of Vanishing.”
“The inspiration was definitely living in Los Angeles since August,” he said. Reynolds said he remembers seeing wildfires raging while people continued to go about their routine lives, something he called a “setting for absurdity.”
As for winning top honors, Reynolds was just as surprised as anyone.
“I’m totally shocked. People did things I never thought to do,” he said, pointing out a creative cutout standing only a few feet behind him.
The competition not only shed light on the breadth of talent at USC but also gave a new perspective on the power of literature to inspire and transport readers to completely different realms. Meandering about the room, visitors got a glimpse of students’ talents and the full range of Carroll’s influence on readers. In fact, not all the contestants were particularly familiar with his work. The unencountered ideas that stemmed from Carroll’s work can still be appreciated today.
“People think libraries are stuffed mausoleums of books,” Quinlan said.
But the dean believes there’s more to the university’s reserves than one might expect.
“Working with a library collection can be a lot of fun.”

“Hello, suckers!” cries Terra C. MacLeod’s sultry Velma Kelly at the beginning of Chicago’s second act. She’s speaking, of course, to us, the audience, and we chuckle because we know she’s right. Chicago — in ways far slinkier and shadier than we might originally think or expect — makes suckers of us all, and it’s next to impossible to resist.
Jazz hands · Terra C. MacLeod (center) plays Velma Kelly, a Vaudeville performer who murders her husband and sister after finding them in bed together. The musical follows other celebrity criminals. - Photo courtesy of Broadway/L.A. 
Chicago, a musical vaudeville set in the morally polluted streets of Prohibition-era Chicago, works its many charms imperceptibly. It starts off with a bang — two literal explosions to be exact — but then pulls back and slows down. It’s possible to be bored for a time — the plot is so paper-thin it’s a wonder the show pulls off two-plus hours — but that’s the point.
By the time Velma greets us with that most exquisite of insults, we smile in spite of ourselves because we know then that, while we thought we were bored, we were in fact being seduced and manipulated into this subversive, sordid, spectacular world.
Now in a three-week run at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood as part of its 11th national tour, the present revival of Chicago, which premiered on Broadway in 1996, is a permutation of the 1975 original, itself based on a 1926 play.
Audiences today might be more familiar with Rob Marshall’s 2002 movie adaptation — a fine film, well-acted and visually interesting but clunky and ostentatious in comparison to the stage show.
Because it’s been adapted and re-adapted so many times, one would be far better off banishing all preconceptions of Chicago before taking his seat at the Pantages.
That reality is heightened when Chicago deliberately and repeatedly breaks the fourth wall in its interaction with the crowd, a more modern trend that probably didn’t sit well with more traditional audiences.
When Velma speaks to us, we feel suddenly self-conscious, which is of course the point — to make us uncomfortable with ourselves. The story about Roxie Hart (Michelle Williams, of Destiny’s Child fame), a chorine-turned-murderess who, aided by an opportunistic defense attorney (Brent Barrett’s Billy Flynn) and a sympathetic public, exploits her crime for fame.
Chicago’s creators John Kander and Fred Ebb, with Bob Fosse contributing his iconic choreography, chose to keep the stage sparse, making it easier for the audience to make connections.
The set is mostly a few chairs and ladders, the props a few hats and feather plumes, but we still see everything — the jail (where the six merry murderesses sing a show-stopping “Cell Block Tango”), the courtroom (where the orchestra’s box, completely on stage, looms like a massive judge’s seat) and Billy Flynn’s office (where he sings about love). It’s the brilliance of the production that it can feel totally overproduced but in reality be starkly minimalist.
Of course, there wouldn’t be a show without its central performances, and most are up to the task. Williams’ Roxie, who kills her ex-lover in a fit of rage at the start of the show, might seem strange at first. By the end of the first act, however, we understand her character. Williams brings a rich voice, a playful sensuality and a light comedic touch to the role, and it’s a winner.
But MacLeod’s Velma, a washed-up vaudevillian in jail for a double homicide, steals many of Williams’ scenes. She’s a simple character — all passion and desperation — played with wonderful complexity. Desperate to reclaim the limelight Roxie steals from her, Velma will even stoop so low as to ask Roxie to be her performance partner once they get out of jail.
That number, “I Can’t Do It Alone,” showcases MacLeod’s formidable dancing and singing abilities. Her legs slice through the air with sharp precision, though she should be wary of overplaying her body in non-musical scenes.
Carol Woods as Matron “Mama” Morton, a meaty role, is a standout. Of the show’s five numbers of pure magnificence — “Cell Block Tango,” “When You’re Good to Mama,” “A Little Bit of Good,” “Class” and Roxie and Velma’s final performance — Woods has two of them. Her vocal power is through the roof.
Other notables include Barrett’s Flynn and Amos (Riis Farrell), Roxie’s wallflower of a husband whose aw-shucks niceness in “Mister Cellophane” is particularly memorable.
R. Lowe’s Mary Sunshine is superb, and the surprise reveal in the second act alone is worth the price of admission (about $70 for center orchestra).
It’s the male ensemble performers who pull the show down. They’re showy, distracting and occasionally effeminate in their dancing. In a show about standing in the spotlight — literally and figuratively — the urge to shout and be the center of attention is understandable but should be down played.
Chicago is as much dance as it is song, and Fosse’s choreography is unstoppable. It’s loud and soft, big and little but never over the top. Ken Billington’s lighting is striking, and the Pantages has never sounded better (Scott Lehrer did the sound design). William Ivey Long’s simple, black, lacey costumes are cleverly androgynous, in keeping with the show’s subtle homoeroticism and general promotion of ambiguity.
In the end, we expect some big finale, but of course we don’t exactly get it. We get a final “All That Jazz,” the show’s lasting signature done here with poise and restraint, amid a paradoxical backdrop of glitz and glamor.
Chicago messes with the crowd from the start, duping us into cheering for everything that’s wrong with society — the glamorization of crime, the amorality of the justice system and the glorification of violence. It’s mesmerizing, and we can’t get enough.
Suckers, indeed.

When I first took this column two and a half years ago, I envisioned saying goodbye in a three-part series.
The first would be a detailed look at the birth of the column. Part two would be a retelling of its life.
Part three would be an in-depth look at its title, “Thrilla on Manilla Paper.” After all, you deserve to know what in the world could possibly have led to such a name. And before this is all over, you might still get that explanation.
But instead of a three column series, it is just this one.
I thought, two and a half years ago, by the time it was all said and done, I’d need thousands of words to sum everything up. Instead, it’s just a few hundred on this piece of paper.
In fact, one sentence might do the trick. So here it goes.
What a long, strange trip it’s been.
It’s a journey that has truly traversed this campus and country.
It has gone from the steps of Heritage Hall to the gates of Dedeaux Field, from press row at Galen Center to the tallest heights of the Coliseum.
It’s a trip that’s taken me from Los Angeles to the top of a hill in Berkeley; from the cozy confines of South Bend, Ind., to the open air of Seattle, Wash.
It’s taken me from a stadium that seats 100,000 people in Columbus, Ohio, to a stadium that sounds like it seats 100,000 people in Eugene, Ore.
Simply being there has been remarkable and being able to share it with you through my lens has been just as great.
But simply being there is not the story. No, this column would be far more boring if it were just a retelling of the places I’ve been.
Postcards are for brief hellos and goodbyes. Columns are not. Columns are a place for opinion and analysis — a look at what has occurred along that journey.
But again, this would just be a space filled with words if there were no characters. So I owe it to all the men and women who have graced these pages along the way, who have made the stories what they were — and given me the ability to write what I’ve written.
There was Pete Carroll, who over the last four years was one of the most quotable people on the planet.
He reveled in every win, and was quick to point out who deserved praise, wallowed in each loss and never hesitated to point the finger at himself.
Without Carroll, this would just been stories about a football team. Instead, wins and losses took on a life of their own, with Carroll’s commentary as an integral part of their interpretations one way or another.
There was Joe McKnight, whose tenure at USC was a tumultuous one, filled with great promise and flashes of brilliance as well as great disappointment.
Without McKnight, this would have been a football team with a lot of running backs. Instead, it was a football team with a bevy of backs, one of which could have been legendary.
There was Tim Floyd, Taj Gibson, Dwight Lewis, Daniel Hackett, O.J. Mayo and DeMar Derozan. All six were central figures in the meteoric rise of USC basketball and key players in its sudden fall.
There is Jovan Vavic, the candid and quotable head coach of USC’s top-ranked water polo teams. He reached the pinnacle of the sport but found obstacles in his attempt to repeat — that was, until he got over the hump.
But again, it would just be a story if not for Vavic’s passion and intensity. He spoke his mind and wore his emotions on his sleeve, making for more than just some article about a few games in a pool.
There have been dozens of other names that have crossed these pages, each with a story to tell and each with the unique ability to make a story more than just words.
Really, all I’ve done over the last two and a half years is mix their words and actions with my opinions. What you have as the end result is a column.
Whether you’ve agreed with me or not is not important. It’s whether you’ve taken the time to agree with me or not that’s more important.
If you have, thank you. I hope you’ve been able to take something away from this.
The inches left in this paper are running low, so before I say goodbye for good, let me explain one last thing: my column’s name.
I wanted to name it “From the Parking Lot,” in reference to a shot by former Vermont basketball player T.J. Sorrentine. He hit a deep three late in a first round game against Syracuse in 2005, securing an upset for the No. 13 Catamounts. The shot was from way behind the arc, prompting Gus Johnson to say: “Sorrentine hit that one from the parking lot.”
But the Daily Trojan’s sports editor at the time, Peter Simones, said the reference was too obscure. Instead, after brainstorming, a title playing off one of the greatest boxing matches of all time was chosen.
Clever, I know.
Anyway, now that the name situation has been settled, that time is drawing near. It’s the time where this column comes to an end.
But before it’s knocked out for good, I want to leave you with a quote from General MacArthur. He said, “Old columnists never die, they just fade away.”
Actually, I don’t think that’s what he said. But it’s too late now. There’s no space left to talk about it, no columns left to write.
“Thrilla on Manilla Paper” ran every other Friday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Grant at tunkel@usc.edu.

USC looks to ride the momentum from Tuesday night’s come-from-behind victory against UC Santa Barbara into its Pac-10 series with Oregon this weekend in Eugene, Ore.
Struggling · Sophomore starter Ben Mount (3-3, 3.77 ERA) has not recorded a victory since his April 2 start against Oregon State. - Avi Kushlan | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans will be trying to notch their first conference series win of the season against the No. 18 Ducks (25-12, 6-6).
Trailing 8-0 late in Tuesday’s matchup at Dedeaux Field, USC (16-20, 2-10) scored two times in the seventh, twice in the eighth and four more times in the bottom of the ninth to steal a victory against UCSB. Senior outfielder Mike O’Neill scored the game-winning run on a wild pitch to seal the deal for USC, which had lost six contests in a row.
Oregon is also riding high after taking two of three last weekend against then-No. 1 UCLA. The Ducks won the first two games of the series before dropping last Sunday’s finale, 5-1. Oregon also defeated Gonzaga twice this week in non-conference action and has won seven of its last 10 games.
USC coach Chad Kreuter will send out sophomore starter Andrew Triggs tonight at 7 p.m. in the series opener. The right-hander (1-6, 4.14 ERA) has not earned a win since his first start of the season. In his last outing against Arizona State, Triggs went five innings, allowing five runs (two earned) on four hits. He struck out five.
Triggs’ counterpart will be Oregon sophomore Tyler Anderson. The Ducks’ left-hander is 5-3 with a 2.63 ERA this season. He’s racked up 55 strikeouts in 54 and two-third innings pitched. In his last start against UCLA, Anderson allowed four runs on five hits in four and two-third innings in the Ducks’ 5-4 victory against UCLA.
Trojans’ sophomore Ben Mount will take the ball in Saturday’s 5 p.m. matchup. In 10 games this season (eight starts), Mount is 3-3 with a 3.77 ERA and 40 strikeouts. Opposing Mount will be Oregon’s Justin LaTempa. The right-hander is 3-2 with a 3.35 ERA and 34 strikeouts.
Sunday’s 12 p.m. series finale will square Oregon’s Alex Kuedell (4-4, 3-20) against USC. Kreuter has yet to decide a starter for the game, but his decision will mostly likely come down to senior Kevin Couture (2-1, 6.75) or sophomore Chad Smith (4-5, 4.46).
The Ducks are batting .276 on the season with a staff ERA of 2.92, while the Trojans’ hitters have tallied a .285 batting average and their pitching has compiled a 4.79 ERA.
Catcher Eddie Rodriguez has been the Ducks’ leader on offense so far this season. He tops the team with a .331 batting average, .424 slugging percentage and .398 on-base percentage. He has hit two home runs to go along with 24 RBI.
USC leads the all-time series against Oregon, 19-2, and it swept the Ducks last season at Dedeaux Field. Tonight’s game will mark the first time USC baseball has played in Eugene since 1969.

Well it’s been a few days since Kick-Ass’s release and a recent article in the L.A. Times made me want to reevaluate it for some of its more engaging elements.
Kick-Ass did provide a fun and different kind of superhero movie with a realistic spin on things (minus the jet-pack Gatling gun) in a way much different from Batman Begins-style realism.
The violence did feel extreme at some points, but it fit with the movie’s sense of showing the audience how bloody trying to be a super-hero would actually be. The title character’s attempt to stop two thugs ends with him being stabbed in the gut, which is pretty much how things would end up if a guy in a costume attempted to stop some real street thugs.
Unique and well-defined characters like Hit-Girl and Red Mist were helpful in showing how one person can be a very different superheroe. Hit-Girl is too young to really make any moral choices and goes by what her father taught her, which involves killing anyone who is a threat and showing no mercy.
Of all the superhero movies I’ve seen, very few depict a hero as brainwashed and Kick Ass brought that possibility to light. Spiderman, Batman, Superman and Ironman all accept the burden of their life and none fights for revenge. In fact, by most other superhero stories, Hit-Girl and Big Daddy — who is a clear parody of Batman —would be considered the villains because of their blatantly violent methods. Instead they are the unlikely heroes Kick-Ass uses to tear apart the genre.

The Colorado Court of Appeals recently came to a ruling that allows students at the University of Colorado Boulder with concealed gun permits to carry weapons on campus. The decision was reached when the court ruled in favor of a group of students at the university. Students for Concealed Carry on Campus claimed the university’s ban on concealed carry violated state gun laws — in particular the Concealed Carry Act of 2003.
This is a dangerous decision.
After the tragedies at Virginia Tech and Columbine, it is ridiculous that a court would allow students to carry guns on a school campus. This ruling establishes a foundation upon which future judgments can be made, potentially expanding the right to carry a concealed weapon from the University of Colorado Boulder to any other institution of higher learning.
The baggage this decision carries weighs heavily on the future of gun control at universities. What if a similar group of students at USC followed in suit, fighting for the right to carry a gun on our campus?
How would you feel in lecture knowing the student you are sitting next to could very well have a gun in his backpack? Would you buy a gun to protect yourself from him? Would your neighbor buy a gun, too? Would the whole lecture carry guns to class?
If four hundred students in one room have a gun, there is no way anyone can feel safe.
Let’s say a fictional student, Tommy, is having a really bad day: He failed his math test, his girlfriend broke up with him and he might not have the money to attend school next semester. Now we have Mikey, who has no clue what is going on with Tommy, and accidently bumps into the poor sap.
This makes Tommy mad. Tommy has a gun. Tommy decides to shoot Mikey during lecture. Because everyone can legally have a gun on campus, someone shoots Tommy. Someone shoots that someone. Someone shoots that someone. It goes on until the room looks like a scene from a Tarantino film.
Good thing guns were allowed on campus, right?
How would you feel if your roommate had a gun? Could you sleep in your own room?
The slogan of the National Rifle Association is “Gun’s Don’t Kill People, People Kill People” — an idea it has adapted to refute gun control.
This seems only to be an excuse to remove the blame and guilt of the many deaths guns have caused from the people who for some reason believe having a gun on their person is the right thing to do.
The NRA further reference the right to bear arms listed in the Constitution to make their case..
But everyone is aware the Second Amendment was ratified in 1791 as a bastion to form a militia. Madison’s idea behind the amendment was to ensure the formation of a militia to rise up against a government, not the gratuitous possession of firearms.
The idea of gun control, along with many other topics of heated debate in America, is hard to argue over because there is no definite line as to where a gun ban should exist, or even if it should exist in the first place.
However, in the case of the university campus, there should be a ban on firearms. Not only are guns unsafe, but they also create an atmosphere of unease for many.
John Gudenzi is a junior majoring in English.
John,
While I can understand your apprehension let’s not ignore a few missed points in your personal opinion.  You mention that Tommy may have a bad day and use his gun to shoot Mickey.  Perhaps someone may then shoot Tommy (obviously we are not talking about Tommy Trojan here), and so be it.  Your concern it may turn into some sort of scene from a Tarantino film is a bit farfetched and a symptom of Hollywood’s affect on people’s perception of reality.
The challenge in the Colorado courts is borne out of concern for public safety whether you agree or not.  The facts in Virginia Tech cannot be ignored.  Had there been someone in a position to stop the killing, many more would have survived.  Only one student present in the classroom where the attack began tried to stop the attacker and was killed.  That man is a hero and understood it was necessary for someone to act.  The other students reacted by hiding behind one another and died that way, giving up their survival in hopes the attacker may suddenly turn benevolent.
My opinion I that guns are not unsafe in themselves, but are tools to protect oneself and others.  I agree with you that concern exists over their place in an educational institution.  But don’t ignore the fact that guns have been used by people on campuses where guns were not permitted with tragic outcomes.  I believe that students in Colorado take the position that they can defend themselves and their fellow students in a more timely manner, and stop killing before police can arrive.  
If given a choice, I would choose to be the sheep dog over sheep.
Oh my gosh, what a bunch of fallacious arguments these sh*t-kicker wearing; pig-wrasslin’, Skoal in their lips dipping; driving their rusty Chevy truck with the shotgun rack; confederate flag hanging bumpkins come up with. What works in your little “redneckville USA” doesn’t work here in Los Angeles. I understand that in the places you come from, there are miles and miles of open, natural land in which you can shoot a gun and nobody will be hurt. It ain’t like that in Los Angeles. The status quo or societal norm in your little “population 115; great grandma and grandpa lived here for generations; everybody knows each other, etc. etc.” doesn’t apply here. So take your militia-minded; “NRA” and “Bush/Cheney” faded bumper sticker adorning, from underneath that rock you lived under. Step into the 21st century.
Sorry, I am not a sh*t-kicker etc.  I am a USC graduate and lived in the USC/LA area for 16 years (I was also born in Orange County). I have done my duty for the USA in the US Navy as both enlisted and as an officer.  I am a licensed and instrument rated Pilot. I am also a certified Dive Master.  I have been a Police Officer in La Habra, CA and attended the police academy at Rio Hondo, CC.  I currently am working as a Software Architect in Memphis TN. Population 1,700,000 with approximately the same population density as LA.  So please take your opinionated, small-minded, racist remarks to your Klu-Klux Klan meetings or have your parents lock up your computer and go to bed at 9:00 pm like all the other kids.
So what was your major at USC? “Condescending and arrogant remarks”? And seriously, the fact that most of your professional experience has involved guns, weapons, and the violence monopoly doesnt make you seem like a rational, not-emotionall-guided and thoughtfull commentator on the subject of guns and gun control. In fact, it makes you seem like a gun-fetishist.Second, who cares if you are a pilot and dive instructor?! Good for you.
This is a discussion, not a recruitment board. No point in posting your resume here.
What on earth do you need a gun for these days? I am so sick of this American fantasy that we still live in the era of cowboys and a sidearm is essential for protection. Protection from what?!? The Trojan Dining golf carts? Crazy homeless people? Paddle wielding frat bros? It’s so easy to sit back from a distance and fantasize about gun ownership, but I can tell you right now, if USC ever allowed students to carry firearms on campus or in student housing, I would transfer in a heartbeat and never look back. If my roommate had a gun, I would promptly find a new place to live, even if the guy was Mohandas Gandhi. I do not want to live or go to school in an area where gun use is trusted to the greater population. Sorry, but my faith in people handling firearms responsibility is not as strong as others’.
I think everyone should be allowed to carry rocket launchers, big machine guns and flamethrowers on campus. And drive to school in an Abrams tank, and perhaps not even get out of the tank for lecture. I mean, I do have the right to defend myself according to the second ammendment. Besides, how else am I going to feel safe when everyone else is carrying guns unless I have some sort of armored transport to take me around. I mean, sersiouly, I need to be able to carry heave military grade weapons to school in order to feel safe and protect myself against everyone else with guns.
The board of trustees would not decide on such a rule over state schools, it would be the Board of Regents who are in a sense all state officers. Generally bans on guns on public school property are decided by the state legislature though so for something like this to change a legal challenge would be made against the state, constitution, or past legislative rulings on gun bans on public school property.
In response to your question to what would stop an 18 year old from bringing a concealed shotgun on campus if a ban was lifted, what is to stop them from doing that now? Absolutely nothing. It is rather foolish to make to try to make this argument as there isn’t any evidence to use to show that gun violence went up on college campuses after bans were lifted. Also, is there any statistical data showing gun violence went *down* after a ban was placed on guns on college campuses? I can’t think of a state that allows gun on public college campuses where data like this might be available.
Yeah, absolutely nothing will stop them from doing that…except this thing called…uhhhnmmm.. “The law”. But if you believe the law is not enough to stop anyone from doing anything, why not abolish completely as well as any ineffective bans on guns?
What I was trying to get at is that any individual who is emotionally deranged enough to maliciously bring a weapon onto campus certainly isn’t going to consider the legal ramifications of their actions. The law does not stop those individuals because they could care less about the law as history has unfortunately proven.
The point I was attempting to make is that gun bans or lack thereof do not stop those sort of incidents from occurring. Metal detectors or preventative social/suicidal counseling? perhaps…
The same can be said for just about anything that is illegal. Murder is illegal, yet it still happens. Does that automatically mean that murder should be legalized? What should be considered is that school shootings and such are as a rule extended suicides. The person who commits these things are very depressed and suffering from a long line of problem. They plan on killing themselves and taking as many as possible with them. In almost every case these people have bought their guns legally. Because deranged lunatics like Cho wouldnt have the street smarts or people skills to establish a connection with an illegal weapons dealer. These are crazies who just happen to have guns available to them.
Also, what I meant was not that they will stop because of their consideration for the law (they are planning to commit suicide anyways). But the law will allow authorities to take action against them for carrying guns on campus. As a law student I think I view the law a bit differently. Also suggesting that everyone should have a gun to defend agains these crazies invites to a armaments race, where the crazies will probably start getting bullet-proof vets and bigger guns to take out anyone who might shoot back. Hardly the ideal situation. And what if the guy who shoots back is not the best shot and shoots someone else? Just because u are awesome at the gun range doesnt mean that you will perform as well when u are under pressure in a life-or-death situation.
Some of you comment that this article is a “straw man,” “slippery slope” argument and the likes. I personally, think it’s scary to know that someone in his/her early 20’s or younger, has a firearm on them. I don’t think most people will snap and pull a Columbine or Virginia Tech because he/she is having a bad day, or their personal lives are in disarray; but Columbine, Virginia Tech and the likes should have taught us a lesson. These tragedies aren’t too far back in the past. 
What do you need a gun for? Why do you feel compelled to carry it on your person? Just like your counter arguments, that…you wouldn’t be afraid to fall asleep if your room mate or fellow student in a lecture hall has a gun on his/her person. 
Then me ask you this. Are there gun ranges on campus? Do you strongly believe that someone on campus or off campus will cause you bodily harm? 
Carrying a gun around is pretty “wild wild West” if you ask me. We’re not a bunch of crude neanderthals who need to carry “big clubs so to fight off threatening tribes.”
This is an op-ed piece, one I feel rather strongly about, so I would like to respond to the comments thus far.
Casey – I could not sleep in my room with a stranger owning a gun.
Joe – I hope that I have not given you the idea to start a suit, that would be the opposite effect of what I wanted.
David – State schools and private universities is something I looked into. Of course private universities have the right to ban firearms, I believe state schools do as well as there are a board of trustees appointed to run the schools (to change their ruling would negate their presence). Also if state schools did allow guns on college campuses, what is to stop 18 year old high school students from carrying shotguns in their bags (a lacrosse bag can fit a shotgun)?
Not Sure – The article is more to make a point than anything. Many people can pass tests, but it only takes one accident or one fleeting thought to end up in a bad situation with a gun.
Mr. Wills – You bring up many interesting points I would like to address. First, you claim the number of homicides decreased as firearm carrying was legalized more freely in your town in Tennessee. I’m going to take your word for it, regardless though, do you not think the amount of deaths in relation to gun control can be relative to the context? Living in Los Angeles can be frightening at times, especially where USC is located, and as I said above, it only takes one accident from the permanent death of a being.
Also, you are worried about students like me sitting in the class room for what reason? Giving my opinion, in an opinion piece? This is illogical. If I believe that guns are unsafe and pointless, I’m going to factor that opinion into my article. Its not an insecurity to wish that everyone could put down weapons, I feel as though it is the opposite, and it is the insecure who cling to their guns. Why do you need them? Also I am aware of the trials of owning a gun, but are you aware many people can walk into a gun show without all of these things you listed and purchase a firearm? I would like to point out, in addition, that for some reason you found the need to point out that women pass a familiarization test more often than men and call this fact odd. What is the oddity about this?
How would you feel if your roommate had a gun? 
I have no problem with him/her owning a gun provided the gun was obtained legally.
Could you sleep in your own room?
Sure, why not?  Like I am going to lose sleep because someone legally owns a gun?  Are you serious?
An armed society is a polite society.  Manners are good when one may have to back up his acts with his life.
— Robert A. Heinlein, “Beyond This Horizon”, 1942
You’re taking Heinlein’s comment out of context, and you need to consider it was written about 70 years ago when the status quo was vastly different then. 
The Virginia Tech perpetrator also obtained a gun LEGALLY…but I’m not saying that all people who obtain guns legally will blow your brains out when you’re asleep. 
Stop using weak fallacious arguments.
“What if a similar group of students at USC followed in suit, fighting for the right to carry a gun on our campus?”
That is a VERY INTERESTING idea.
I can understand how this could be legally challenged regarding conceal carry on public property such as CU Boulder’s campus however would the same right to carry apply when trying to conceal carry on private university property such as with a school like USC? Isn’t USC located on private property and as such can deny the right to carry a gun on-site like most other private property owners? Forgive my ignorance on this matter, I am not for or against conceal carry on school property but just curious how it would apply to a private university versus state schools.
Personally, I think we will be surprised how this turns out. It seems bad, but after researching it my guess is that we won’t see any new shootings as a result of this. The article implies that anyone can now carry a gun at CU, but that isn’t the case. The people who will be allowed to carry must have CCW permits, which means (according to CRS 18-12-203) that they have proven competency with a gun (via military, police, or other training), are at least 21 years old, have not been convicted of a felony, are not alcoholics, are not drug users, have passed a background check, and have no restraining orders against them. In addition, the county sheriff must approve the permit, and can deny someone a permit for pretty much any reason, including past behavior, mental instability, age, etc. It is actually quite difficult to get a CCW permit. I am not saying I am ready to bring this to USC, I’m saying I am not convinced it will turn out badly for CU. Maybe this will precipitate a shooting at CU, or maybe it will prevent or stop one? What would have happened if someone at Virginia Tech had been carrying a concealed weapon?
What a pile of adolescent naiveness. There was an article on this very website, not to long ago, where someone was claiming that allowing weapons in to a restaurant where alcohol is being served would cause untold loss of life.  Well, where is this large number of deaths promised?  I live in Tennessee. Last year this state removed the prohibition of weapons where alcohol was served (They did this simply to maintain the their reciprocity agreements with other states ).  Everybody went running and shouting to the State Legislature claiming the same argument.  They even went so far as to provide statistics of the number homicides performed outside of alcohol serving establishments.  Guess what THE NUMBER OF HOMICIDES WENT DOWN outside of alcohol serving establishments after the law went into effect.  What really worries me is having 400 kids like the author sitting in class.  It really speaks to the demise of education and journalism when the people doing the publishing fail to do any research and rather share their own insecurities with the rest of world and try to pass them off fact.  Please seek psychological help for your insecurities or just simply grow up and look at the facts. 
The facts are: To possess a weapon in any state that allows it your are required by federal law 1) Be of appropriate age. 2) Take an appropriate class to learn the laws and liabilities of carrying a weapon. 3) Pass a weapon familiarization class (more women pass this the first time than men oddly enough). 4) Submit a completed certificate along with a fee (in my state it is $300.00) to cover the costs of a background check at the state and federal levels (in my case it took 135 days – 4 1/2 months).
I can assure you that after approximately 5 1/2 months of waiting, I don’t think anyone would be of the same mindset to do a columbine or a VT massacre.  I also might point out that the criminals in these cases would never have been allowed to own/carry a weapon in either state if they would have gone through this process.  The columbine kids were too young, and the VT person wouldn’t have been able to pass the state background check because of his previous record.
So make decisions on facts and not on adolescent angst.
I suggest then that you take your own advice and check up the facts. First of all, what is the source for these statistics concering number of homicides in tennesse? Pulling random obscure number out of your ass can hardly be called sticking to the facts. Second the VT shooter, Cho, did in fact purchase his guns legally. Third, as you assured, I am sure that YOU think that anyone would not be of the mindset ot commit a massacre after waiting for X months. But you know what? It happened. Not surprisingly, your unproffessional opinion of a school shooters psychology does not carry far. Ironically, you seem to be more motivated to *proving* that guns are “good”, then to looking at the facts. 
If I was as unserious a debator as you, I would simply point out that Europe has much less gun possesion than the united states and much fewer homicides. 
Guns dont kill people, people with guns kill people.

There was once a time when action films ruled cinema. But these were not the action films of today, which safely harbor a PG-13 rating. These films glorified their R rating and ushered in as much on-screen violence, sexuality and as many cheesy one-liners as possible.
The 1980s showcased these over-the-top action films best. And even though they have become almost archaic, Sylvester Stallone is bringing back those glory days of action cinema.
Stallone’s upcoming film, The Expendables, which he directed and co-wrote, hopes to revitalize the action films of the 1980s, and its trailer, and especially its cast, signifies that he could do just that.
The plot is nothing original, but as the classic action films of the 1980s proved, that is never a problem. The film revolves around a group of mercenaries who find themselves involved in a mission that suddenly becomes compromised. This ultimately sets the stage for an unprecedented amount of death and mayhem.
While the plot of the film certainly does not matter, what does is the film’s exceptional cast that just so happens to feature almost all of the action heroes that defined the genre more than 20 years ago. Not only does The Expendables include Stallone but it also features Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Eric Roberts, Dolph Lundgren and the immortal Hollywood action star Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Along with showcasing the tried and true of the old action genre, the film also highlights some of today’s action stars, including Jason Statham, Steve Austin and Jet Li.
While the presence of these three in no way compares to the inclusion of the iconic personas of the genre alumni, their presence does in fact signify that The Expendables will not simply be the ’80s revisited, and instead be something that is still fresh.
Stallone was very smart in casting action heroes from both eras, as it will not only draw in a wider appeal for the film but it will also allow it to stand as a timeless example of action films as a whole.
It is this notion that will truly define The Expendables as something more than just an homage to the forgotten films of yesteryear and actually bring back the brutal, yet profoundly comical action standards that have made action films what they are today.
It is refreshing to see someone like Stallone bring all of this back into contemporary cinema. Like all of the stars present in this film, the action genre is where Stallone made his name. While many would consider Rocky to be Stallone’s first noteworthy film, there is still a lot to say about First Blood, a true action film. While Hollywood rehashes films like Rocky every year, it’s intimidated by the thought of ever making a film like the very first Rambo.
The same can be said about Willis. His incredible performance in 1988’s Die Hard helped define the action R-rated film. Again, this is something Hollywood is terrified to reincarnate.
The last installment in the Die Hard franchise was rated PG-13, and the filmmakers had the audacity to muffle the last part of Willis’ trademark line — “Yippie-ki-yay, motherf–ker” — with a gunshot to silence the vulgarity. As far as Schwarzenegger is concerned, the list of classics he has appeared in is endless. His breakout role in 1984’s The Terminator was followed by Commando, Predator, Red Heat and he ended the 1980s with Total Recall. None of these films can ever be outdone.
Although, like Willis, Schwarzenegger also appeared in a lackluster sequel, and as much as everyone will remember the original Terminator, audiences will also unfortunately remember the dreaded Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and last summer’s Terminator Salvation, which thankfully only featured Schwarzenegger in a cameo.
And while The Expendables also only features Schwarzenegger in a cameo, the fact that he will appear in a film that is not afraid to show carnage and not afraid to use vulgar language is certainly a step in the right direction. This can also be said about all three of the film’s most prominent stars.
It is time for Hollywood to once again embrace the notion of exaggerated violence. There have been too many films that depend more on box office revenue than actually personifying all an action film can be. While there are some notable exceptions including The Rock, Face/Off and Enemy of the State, most contemporary films that claim to be action cannot even come close to Schwarzenegger throwing a large knife into someone’s chest, pinning him against a post and then saying with a grin: “Stick around.”
Hopefully Stallone will bring back this lost era of exaggerated violence, language and sexuality, just so audiences can simply have fun with it once again, because fun is exactly what these great actions films are really all about.

With only a week to go before the USC-UCLA dual meet, a select group of the Trojan track and field team will split up this weekend at two Southern California meets.
USC will send the majority of its competing athletes to both the Tiny Lister Invitational at Cal State Los Angeles and the Triton Invitational at UC San Diego in preparation for the championship stretch of their season.
While some of USC’s best competitors will rest this weekend, there is still a strong contingent of Trojans lacing up the spikes.
Juniors Oscar Spurlock and Brendan Ames will run the 110-meter hurdles at Tiny Lister, and freshman Reggie Wyatt and sophomore Duane Walker will run the 400-meter hurdle race.
Ames is coming off a career-best run at the Mt. Sac Relays last weekend, where he ran a 13.80 in the 110-meter hurdles.
Wyatt is also fresh from a career best at Mt. Sac, where he ran a 50.45 in the 400-meter dash.
For the USC women, senior Elizabeth Olear will run the 200-meter dash, the race in which she had a season-best time at last week’s Mt. Sac Relays.
The women will also send their regular 4×100-meter relay team to Cal State Los Angeles.
USC will only send four throwers to the Triton Invitational. Seniors Aaron Dan and Col Campbell will compete in the discus, junior Trey Henderson will compete in the hammer throw and sophomore Alex Adams will participate in both the shot put and the discus for the Trojans.

The USC men’s volleyball team finished the regular season winning five of its last six games.
Even though the Trojans travel to No. 3 Cal State Northridge tomorrow for the first round of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament, a team they lost to twice this season, the Trojans are ready to make a deep run.
“We’re pretty confident. It doesn’t matter who we play at this point,” junior outside hitter Tri Bourne said. “We’re a playoff team, and we know we love playing in these big games. We wanted [No. 1] Stanford, but it really doesn’t matter.”
No. 6 USC (16-10, 13-9) lost to the Matadors (21-8, 15-7) 3-2 and 3-1 in February earlier this season. CSUN plays a very simple and unconventional game, and Bourne said the Matadors thrived on opponents’ negative energy.
“They are a confident team. When they see us getting down on ourselves, they play better,” Bourne said.
Bourne points to a mental block that caused USC to go into the matches against Northridge with an already pessimistic attitude.
“We get on ourselves against Northridge. We don’t match up well against them so we always go into the match like, ‘Man we gotta play Northridge,’” Bourne said. “We just have to be confident. I think we are going to go off on these guys.”
The Trojans are using last year’s playoff run as motivation for this year. Last season, USC went into the MPSF tournament as losers of four out of its last six games, yet made it all the way to the national championship while playing on the road.
Unlike last year, the Trojans are on a winning streak entering the playoffs and have confidence based on the fact that they know they can get to the national championship match because they were there last season.
“Northridge is a hostile environment and we’ve been there before. We know what it’s like to be on the road,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “We’ve pretty much experienced everything. We had a five set come from behind win in the conference quarterfinals last year — we won 3-0 in the semis. In the finals we were down 0-2 and won 21-19 in the fifth set. Then in the national semis we won in four and we went to five in the national championship.”
USC is hoping to get a boost from the return of Bourne, who has sat out the last four games with a broken left thumb. He has been practicing all week and says he’s ready to go. Ferguson called him a game-time decision and isn’t concerned with putting senior Tyler Stevens who has started in place of Bourne on the floor.
“Tyler’s playing great. If we had to play today with Tyler we’d be fine,” Ferguson said. “He’s been our best passer since he’s been in the lineup.”

A clash between two powerhouse rivals that have only lost to each other all season might top the list of statement games.
The No. 1 USC women’s water polo team will treat their fans to such a matchup as they visit the No. 2 Stanford Cardinal (21-1, 6-0)  on Saturday at 4 p.m. You are excused if, amid all the excitement surrounding this contest, you overlook the USC women’s water polo team’s Friday away game against the No. 6 San Jose State (16-11, 2-4) Spartans — just trust that the Women of Troy (19-1, 5-0) are not.
Foes · Stanford handed two-meter Kristen Dronberger and the Women of Troy their only loss of the season at the Stanford Invitational in February. Dronberger was held scoreless against the Cardinal that day. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
A grounded group all season long, this team knows that if it flounders against the Spartans, Saturday’s game will not matter nearly as much. After a 15-5 win against San Jose State at the UC Irvine Invitational, the Women of Troy improved to 20-0 all time against their MPSF foe. But, according to senior utility Forel Davies, history is irrelevant.
“Like any team we go up against, we need to establish a good press and keep tight lanes,” Davies said.
When discussing the Spartans, players might as well have been reading from a teleprompter, intent on communicating that their focus extends to all opponents. However, the players’ fiery spirit and quirky personalities shone through when asked about the Stanford game. The Women of Troy responded excitedly when asked if they want to send Stanford a message for the postseason with a strong showing on Saturday.
Having met twice already, these teams know each other well.
Stanford is led by two-meter Melissa Seidemann, who tops the Cardinal with 40 goals on the season. Cardinal goalies Amber Oland and Kate Baldoni split time between the pipes, and both have impressive goals-against averages.
Understandably, the players were reluctant to offer any specific insight into their game plan but reiterated that their success is largely dependent on their defensive effort and execution. Often, their offense is successful when they generate turnovers and have quick odd-man advantages the other way.
Having already matched up against the Cardinal once before, the Women of Troy are reading for an attack they know will be strong.
“We expect them to play great two-meter defense and to come out hard,” junior two-meter Kristen Dronberger said. “They will probably look to stop [senior driver] Kally [Lucas] and [junior driver] Joelle [Bekhazi] and focus on our shooters.”
This game will determine the top seed for the MPSF, which could prove important in the conference tournament. Although many pundits expect these two teams to meet in the finals regardless of the Saturday’s outcome, this weekend’s game will play a large role in establishing momentum.
The Women of Troy are eager to prove that their early-season loss was a fluke and that their team, which now leads the MPSF in both goals per game and goals allowed per game, can be considered among the best in USC women’s water polo history.

USC’s spring practices might be winding down, but USC coach Lane Kiffin isn’t letting the Trojans take any breaks down the stretch.
Time off · Senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson did not participate in Thursday’s spring practice, and USC coach Lane Kiffin said the Trojans are considering wrist surgery for the receiver, which would likely end his spring. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
Thursday’s practice roster was again hurt by injuries, including those to senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson and redshirt sophomore tailback Curtis McNeal. However, Kiffin was not worried about the injuries at this point in the practice schedule.
“We’re not concerned if they’re completely exhausted by the end of spring,” Kiffin said. “Maybe if it was the end of fall camp. But they got a long time to recover. We can’t slow down.”
Johnson’s injury to his wrist was severe enough for Kiffin to admit wrist surgery was an option for the wide receiver. Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley had a similar operation earlier this year.
“A wrist surgery, compared to Barkley’s, wouldn’t mean he’d be out too long,” Kiffin said. “He was really the star of camp offensively. I feel really good [about] where’s he’s at.”
Redshirt sophomore wide receiver Brice Butler was featured in practice in Johnson’s absence, and took to the assignment with confidence.
“My mind-set out there every day is that I am No. 1 regardless of what it looks like or what it actually is,” Butler said. “I have to feel like I’m the No. 1 guy.”

USC’s running game continued to thrive behind the Trojan offensive line, which was also hit hard by injuries during Thursday’s practice.
“At one point, we were down to six offensive linemen, so those guys continued to push in there,” Kiffin said.
Despite the injuries, senior fullback Stanley Havili continued to be impressed by the effort put forth by his front line.
“The offensive line has been doing a good job,” Havili said. “[The running backs] do what we do, and the line does what they do.”
Kiffin sees some positive coming from the decimated offensive line — much-needed experience that they need for fall camp and the upcoming season.
“It’s definitely going to pay off for them down the road as we go into fall camp,” Kiffin said. “I can’t imagine anybody in the country who is working harder when you consider the reps they’re taking. They’re basically taking every snap.”

Last week’s volcanic eruption in Iceland has brought a large part of the world to a standstill, instigating a storm of disgruntled travelers, accusations against E.U. leaders and millions of dollars in lost revenue for airlines. With eight days of closed airspace and over 95,000 canceled flights as of Tuesday, there is good reason for the airline industry and its consumers to be worried and frustrated.
The media seems to imply that the most pressing issue is figuring out how to get European travelers to their destinations. And though that is a legitimate concern, there is a significant issue being neglected here.
All this ruckus about air travel has distracted the public to the environmental impact of the eruption. What are the consequences of the eruption on our health, our climate and our planet’s well-being? There is, strangely, a lack of coverage on the environmental and health impacts of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, during Earth Week no less.
Perhaps it’s because this was a somewhat minor eruption that hasn’t caught the concern of many volcanologists, who believe that the long-term effects are largely negligible. But looking at the stunning photographs of the seven mile-high ash plume and the dark, heavy clouds looming across Iceland, it would be hard to disregard the eruption as an occurrence with no serious consequences.
The ash contains flakes of molten rock with sharp edges that, when inhaled, are harmful and difficult to remove. And if Eyjafjallajokull were to intensify, it could trigger the adjacent Katla volcano, whose eruption could be infinitely more devastating and detrimental to the nearby population.
According to Information is Beautiful, a creative infography blog, the European aviation industry emits more than 344,000 tons of carbon dioxide a day, while the volcano has emitted over 150,000 tons per day. Thus, on the bright side, canceling 60 percent of flights this week has saved our skies over 206,000 tons of carbon dioxide.
But from what last week’s eruption has proven, even a minor, distant eruption can disrupt the entire global economy.

This year marks the 40th anniversary of Earth Week and USC’s second annual celebration. Despite the high hopes of organizers, this year’s festivities have been much less prominent than they had originally hoped; it’s a marginal event that only catches the attention of a minority of students.
In a way, this lackluster response on campus is reflective of the apathetic attitude toward the Icelandic volcanic eruption. All our attention is being focused on the distresses of travelers because of the sense of urgency to get them home. But just because there is not a similar sense of urgency to discuss how bad the eruption really was for our environment doesn’t mean it’s not equally, if not more, important than the travelers’ well-being.
According to The New York Times, organizations around the world are finding that on this 40th anniversary of Earth Week, they have had to succumb to eco-consumerism, turning to retail in order to successfully execute their Earth Day programs. Some believe eco-consumerism detracts from the original purpose of the awareness day, while others snatch the opportunity to make profits.
Robert Stone, an independent documentary filmmaker who created a film about the history of the American environmental movement, offered an interesting perspective: “Every Earth Day is a reflection of where we are as a culture. If it has become commoditized, about green consumerism instead of systemic change, then it is a reflection of our society.”
Likewise, if, after a natural disaster strikes, all we care about is whether people get to board planes again, that is a reflection of our society and the largely neglectful attitude we hold toward our environment.
Is it right to discount the importance of the environment in situations such as this?
We should be sure to consider the environmental consequences in all situations.

The Daily Trojan will be live blogging the NFL Draft. Check back for updates on Trojans selected in the upcoming days.
2:17 p.m.: With the final pick of the 2010 NFL draft, the Detroit Lions selected wide reciever Timothy Toone, bringing the three-day, 255-pick event to a close.
In total, seven USC players were chosen by NFL teams to fill a variety of needs in the professional ranks. Safety Taylor Mays was the first to go, at No. 49 overall, and tight end Anthony McCoy proved to be the last at No. 185.
Among those left undrafted were center Jeff Byers, cornerback Josh Pinkard and running back Stafon Johnson. All of the undrafted former Trojans will get a chance at free agency in the coming weeks — another chance to prove they belong in the NFL.
Thanks for sticking around with the Daily Trojan’s live coverage of the 2010 NFL draft.
11:45 a.m.: With the 16th pick of the sixth round (No. 185 overall), the Seattle Seahawks selected USC tight end Anthony McCoy.
Analysis: When news broke that McCoy may have failed a drug test at the NFL combine, draft prognosticators predicted a precipitous fall down the draft board for the highly-touted tight end. With his draft stock falling fast, McCoy ended up landing into familiar arms — those of former USC coach Pete Carroll.
McCoy spent three years with the Trojans, racking up 46 career receptions, 731 receiving yards and three touchdowns. Many draft analysts predicted that McCoy would end up being a far better blocking tight end than receiving tight end, but deciding his role in Seattle’s offense is up to Carroll.
Carroll’s Seattle Seahawks selected the senior just hours after trading for another former Trojan, running back LenDale White.
10:52 a.m.: With the 14th pick of the fourth round (No. 112 overall), the New York Jets selected USC running back Joe McKnight.
Analysis: With Thomas Jones gone to the Kansas City Chiefs and Leon Washington traded to the Seahawks, the Jets were in need of another running back to compliment Shonn Greene. In free agency, the Jets picked up LaDainian Tomlinson, but the aging superstar won’t be able to carry a full load. McKnight can help spell Tomlinson, especially as the season draws to a close, and keep him fresh.
McKnight’s time with the Trojans was characterized by comparisons to a running back who proceeded him, Reggie Bush. Although he might not have reached the level of the Heisman Trophy-winning back, McKnight did spend three strong seasons with the team. McKnight leaves USC with 2,213 career rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. His final year in Cardinal and Gold was his most productive, rushing for more than 1,000 yards for the first time in his career and finding the endzone eight times.
Saturday, 10:10 a.m.: With the second pick of the fourth round (No. 100 overall), the Minnesota Vikings selected USC defensive end Everson Griffen.
Analysis: Griffen was expected to be off the draft board much earlier than the beginning of the fourth round, so the Vikings likely wanted to take a player who had been rated as a first round prospect leading up to the draft. The defensive end position is filled nicely in Minnesota with Jared Allen and Ray Edwards — who combined for 23 sacks last season — but it never hurts to get younger.
Griffen had three solid years with the Trojans, recording 82 career tackles and 16 sacks.
—
7:15 p.m.: With their compensatory selection (No. 98 overall) the Atlanta Falcons selected Alabama offensive guard Mike Johnson, bringing the day’s draft action to a close.
Four USC players were selected on the second day of the three-day NFL draft: Kevin Thomas, Charles Brown, Taylor Mays and Damian Williams. Among those still left on the board are defensive end Everson Griffen, running backs Joe McKnight and Stafon Johnson and tight end Anthony McCoy.
Tune back in tomorrow for more draft coverage and analysis from the Daily Trojan!
6:57 p.m.: With the 30th pick of the third round (No. 94 overall) the Indianapolis Colts have selected USC cornerback Kevin Thomas.
Analysis: The Colts let cornerback Marlin Jackson go to the Philadelphia Eagles in March, so restocking their defensive backfield became a viable option for their 2010 draft. Thomas can provide depth and skill to a secondary that has been weakened by cornerback Bob Sanders’ injury problems.
Thomas played for four years with the Trojans, but made his biggest impact after redshirting his junior season. During his final two years with USC, Thomas racked up a combined 61 tackles and three interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown.
6:35 p.m.: The Cleveland Browns have selected Texas quarterback Colt McCoy with the 21st pick of the third round (No. 85 overall). McCoy is the winningest college quarterback of all time, recording 45 victories during his time with the Longhorns.
6:10 p.m.: With the 13th pick of the third round (No. 77 overall) the Tennessee Titans selected USC wide receiver Damian Williams.
Analysis: Former USC linebacker and current Titans coach Jeff Fisher welcomes the Trojan wide receiver to an offense that lacks a true No. 1 receiving option to compliment the Titans’ strong running game. Tennessee’s receiving core — headlined by Kenny Britt, Justin Gage and Nate Washington — was unable to distract defenses from running back Chris Johnson, who still eclipsed 2,000 yards rushing on the season.
If Williams can help improve the Titans’ passing options, Johnson may be able to run more freely than against the eight-man boxes he saw in during the ’09 season.
5:31 p.m.: With the final pick of the second round (No. 64 overall) the Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints selected USC offensive tackle Charles Brown.
Analysis: New Orleans was not in desperate need of another tackle, but Brown gives the defending Super Bowl champs some flexibility and depth at the position. Brown was projected by many as a first round pick, so many will consider this selection a steal to close out the second round of the draft. Brown will compete for a starting role in an already strong unit.
4:24 p.m.: With the 17th pick of the second round (No. 49 overall) the San Francisco 49ers selected USC safety Taylor Mays. Mays is the first former Trojan off the board, and the lowest first Trojan selected since 2002.
Analysis: The 49ers were in need of a boost to an aging secondary that is led by 30-year old cornerback Nate Clements. Mays will have a chance to compete for a starting job immediately with San Francisco, who finished 8-8 last season.
Mays spent four solid seasons in the Trojan secondary and finished with 268 career tackles and five interceptions. Mays was also a three-time first team All-American selection at safety and was invited to this year’s Senior Bowl.
4:22 p.m.: With the 16th pick of the second round (No. 48 overall) the Carolina Panthers selected Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy Clausen. Many draft prognosticators believed Clausen would be selected in the first round, some even predicting he would be among the first ten players drafted.
4:15 p.m.: USC will not have a player selected in the top 45 of the NFL draft for the first time since 2002.
3:26 p.m.: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have selected UCLA defensive tackle Brian Price with the fourth pick of the second round (No. 35 overall), meaning a Bruin has been selected before a USC player for the first time since 2002.
That year UCLA linebacker Robert Thomas (No. 31) and UCLA running back DeShaun Foster (No. 34) were selected before USC cornerback Kris Richard (No. 85).
Friday, 2:59 p.m.: Day two of the NFL draft is about to begin, starting with the St. Louis Rams making the first pick of the second round (No. 33 overall). No USC players were selected in yesterday’s first round, but four or more former Trojans could be selected today. Follow along live with the Daily Trojan for complete coverage.
—
10:18 p.m.: Daily Trojan columnist Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz’s take on day one of the NFL draft:
“Pretty surprising that USC didn’t sneak a single guy in, but there were a lot of unexpected picks on the first day. Look for four USC players to be drafted in the second round.”
8:05 p.m.: The New Orleans Saints have selected Florida State cornerback Patrick Robinson with the 32nd overall pick of the NFL draft. That means that no USC players were selected in the first round — the first time that has happened since the 2007 NFL draft.
Thursday, 6:08 p.m.: Former USC coach Pete Carroll new team, the Seattle Seahawks, select safety Earl Thomas from Texas with the 14th overall pick. The Seahawks also selected offensive tackle Russell Okung of Oklahoma State with the sixth overall pick. The Seahawks have no more scheduled picks today, but trades are still possible. Stay tuned!

In arguably the biggest off-season week the NFL has witnessed in recent memory, it’s understandable how a free agent acquisition of a down-and-out receiver would go unnoticed.
But amidst suspension rulings, schedule announcements and draft day buzz, arguably the biggest story, or at least the one that hits closest to the USC campus this week, was the Seattle Seahawks’ signing of former-Trojan wide receiver Mike Williams.
After an award-laden collegiate career, the Tampa-native pulled a pretty convincing disappearing act during his three-year stint in the NFL.
Yet, for a man and a player with so much still left to prove, Monday’s announcement by the Seattle Times is a staggering feat in and of itself for the athlete who was once hailed as CBSSportsline.com’s 2003 Player of the Year.
While his time at USC was full of national championships, post-season accomplishments and nationwide recognition, in 2004 Williams was dealt a blow that to this day still seems to have had lingering effects. After spending two seasons as the Trojans’ main offensive weapon, Williams decided to take his skills to the next level and declared for the NFL draft. In addition to his decision, the 6-foot-5 standout signed a deal with an agency firm, which permanently voided his scholarship with USC.
Although the decision initially looked to be a wise choice on the part of Williams, who most pundits and draft analysts agreed would be a sure-fire first round draft pick, the 2003 Biletnikoff Award finalist was blindsided by a hit few saw coming. Despite a federal judge ruling in favor of running back Maurice Clarett’s decision to enter the draft after only two years at Ohio State (the league mandates that all draft prospects must be three years removed from high school), the United States Court of Appeals stepped in weeks before the draft and concluded that both Clarett and Williams would be deemed ineligible for the upcoming draft for violating the league’s collegiate policy.
Williams was instantly without a job and a school as the NCAA required him to sit out the entire 2004 season. A year later he would be drafted 10th overall by the Detroit Lions, but the man who was once lauded for his one-handed touchdown grabs and instant playmaking abilities was a shell of the No. 1 Trojan fans had grown accustomed to during his time at USC.
He spent three years in the NFL with three different teams (Lions, Raiders and Titans) before being released by the Tennessee Titans in July of 2007 with only 44 career catches and two touchdowns to his name.
While his weight ballooned to over 270 pounds in his playing career, a svelte Williams showed up at the Seattle Seahawks’ minicamp tryout last week looking to impress the one man who nurtured his growth at USC, former USC coach Pete Carroll.
Of the 17 players competing in the tryout, some were former collegiate stars or NFL burnouts, but few had the rise-and-fall Mike Williams had experienced in such a short time.  In a three day period, Williams, with a body forty pounds lighter and a swagger not seen since his successful days at USC, convinced his former coach and the organization that he was a risk with a high probability of future reward.
Williams and former USC fullback Ryan Powdrell were the only two to receive a contract from the team. And while the former may not have the pedigree that the Seahawks’ big free agent acquisition of last year’s off-season (T.J. Houshmandzadeh) had, there is no question Williams has a lot to play for.
