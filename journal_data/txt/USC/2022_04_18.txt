USC women’s basketball commit Aaliyah Gayles was hospitalized Saturday night after being shot at a house party in North Las Vegas, USC Athletics confirmed Monday. 
Gayles, who was shot 10 times, had two emergency surgeries Sunday morning and an additional surgery Monday morning, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. 
Gayles sustained non-life-threatening injuries along with three other victims after shooting broke out at about 11:15 p.m., the North Las Vegas Police Department said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
Officers determined an argument at the party caused the shooting. The suspect is not in custody, according to the release. 
Gayles’ father, Dwight, took to Twitter Sunday afternoon to provide an update on his daughter’s status.
“I know there is some that will say it’s my fault and I take full responsibility for it but please please keep my baby girl in your prayers Las Vegas,” he wrote.
Dwight gave another update Monday night, tweeting that Gayle’s first surgery “went very well and we expect a full recovery.”
Gayles currently attends Spring Valley High School in Las Vegas, where she earned a five-star rating from ESPN. She is ranked as the No. 8 overall player in the 2022 class. 
After decommitting from USC following the retirement of former women’s basketball Head Coach Mark Trahk, Gayles recommitted to the Trojans following a visit with then-new Head Coach Gottlieb. 
Women’s basketball Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb gave a statement on the situation Monday morning. 
“Aaliyah is one of the strongest, most resilient young people I have ever known,” Gottlieb said. “I have no doubt she will continue to face this unfathomable situation with courage and resolve. We will continue to support her and her parents in every way that we possibly can.”
This story was updated at 11:11 p.m. on April 18 to provide additional information about Aaliyah Gayles’ health as well as updated comments from Dwight Gayles.

Whether he was reporting from Gaza, Sarajevo or the south of India, journalist and USC professor Sandy Tolan could not get his mind off Lulu Pierre. 
Tolan met Pierre in 1991 when visiting the Dominican Republic on assignment for NPR, where he worked at the time. Pierre, then 14 years old, was a victim of a child labor and human-trafficking operation that brought Haitians to the Dominican Republic where they were forced to cut sugar cane on plantations for survival. 
After struggling with the laborious task, Tolan said Pierre “gave up, and he said ‘I give myself up to God.’” Tolan decided to intervene and helped get Pierre back to safety in Haiti.
More than 30 years later, Tolan went back to Haiti in an attempt to make a story about finding Pierre and learn if he had made it back to safety. While this effort was unsuccessful, another story became the focus of Tolan’s return — the modern-day conditions in Dominican sugar cane fields. 
Tolan, along with his reporting partner Euclides Cordero Nuel, created “The Bitter Work Behind Sugar” for Reveal of The Center for Investigative Reporting, copublished with Mother Jones magazine. The story won an Overseas Press Club award and spurred potential change for Haitian cane cutters in the Dominican Republic.
“Because of our reporting, and some additional work in the Washington Post, The United States Congress, through the House Ways and Means committee’s Subcommittee on Trade [has] written two very strong letters, including something called an oversight letter, demanding that three federal agencies investigate what they call ‘slave-like conditions,’” Tolan said. 
Cordero Nuel recounts that Tolan broke the news about the award to the team in a group chat which included the duo’s editor, Michael Montgomery. The Overseas Press Club’s Morton Frank Award is granted to the “best international business news reporting in TV, video, radio, audio or podcast.” The award will be given out at a ceremony in New York on April 21.
Tolan said the situation in the fields and small worker towns, bateyes, did not improve much since his last visit in the ’90s. In 2019, they found houses in disrepair, poor medical care and no electricity or running water.
“Most of the houses didn’t have the basic things we take for granted [in the United States],” said Rafael Perez, a sophomore majoring in business administration, about one of his service trips to the country. “Some had running water, some did not — just not great conditions to live in.”
Workers are paid as little as $4 a day, but it depends on the amount of sugar cane brought in. Healthcare and other services are severely lacking, and the Haitian workers are forced into loan schemes that can incur over 520% interest annually, locking them into a life of debt, Tolan said.
“That’s why Central Romana doesn’t want to change the life of the people,” Cordero Nuel said. “If their lives change because of the better wages, they don’t have workers.’
Central Romana is the massive corporation responsible for approximately 70% of the Dominican Republic’s sugar exports and has incredible power in the country. Cordero Nuel said they are “a state within a state.”
“Central Romana says it’s poured millions of dollars into the bateyes to improve living and working conditions,” Tolan wrote in “The Bitter Work Behind Sugar.” 
Yet, the corporation still exploits its workers with miserable working and living conditions. While those stuck at the bottom of Central Romana suffer, brothers Alfonso and Pepe Fanjul, who bought Central Romana in 1984 with a group of investors, live lives of luxury, traveling on million-dollar yachts and staying at luxury resorts.
This human rights catastrophe doesn’t exist in a vacuum: Much of the Central Romana sugar cane produced by the Haitians goes directly to U.S. processing mills and ends up in the hands of ordinary Americans, Tolan said. 
“It gets turned into cakes and cookies and Hershey bars, literally Hershey bars,” Tolan said. “There literally is a connection between the lives of those people in the Dominican Republic, those Haitian Cane cutters, with the consumer decisions that we make.” 
Cordero Nuel grew up in a batey and attests to the hardships these workers face. The Haitian Dominican journalist has dedicated the majority of his career to telling the stories of Haitian Dominicans, especially those that work in the sugarcane fields.
“When I’m not working on the sugarcane plantation, interviewing [and] talking to the people and investigating the violence there, [the] violations, I’m on the Dominican frontier between the Dominican Republic and Haiti,” Cordero Nuel said.
Cordero Nuel helped culturally and linguistically bridge the gap between the sugarcane workers and Tolan. The pair met when Tolan was looking for someone that was familiar with the area and the Dominican bateyes.
“It’s rare to find someone who has those kinds of linguistic gifts, and courage, and good humor, and kindness and great journalistic instincts,” Tolan said, speaking of Cordero Nuel. 
The team faced danger because of their reporting, at times threatened by armed guards. 
“There were times I put my phone in airplane mode because we thought we were being traced,” Tolan said. 
Both reporters are excited to receive the award, but Tolan is especially excited for Cordero Nuel, given how early he is in his career and the danger he faced reporting. 
“I am so excited for [Cordero Nuel] because it has been more difficult for him. He’s had more difficulties as a result of the story than I have,” Tolan said. “He’s a young journalist who’s relatively early in his career, and I am so thrilled for him above all else.”
Tolan and Cordero Nuel hope these investigations lead the U.S. to take action to hold Central Romana accountable. There is a fear that in doing so, Tolan said, the sugarcane corporation will merely mechanize, leaving its many workers jobless. However, Tolan said Central Romana improving living conditions for its workers is more likely. 
“Action from Congress and possibly from other agencies will have far more sweeping impact than any award could,” Tolan said.

It’s been 11 long years since theatergoers formed lines around the block to watch “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II,” the final chapter of seven books and eight movies that enchanted the hearts of preteens everywhere and influenced pop culture in a way no book series ever had before.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” is the latest effort by author J.K. Rowling to keep the spirit of Harry Potter alive — the first of what is set to be five “Fantastic Beasts” movies released in 2016. While the first movie achieved considerable success, the 2018 sequel suffered overwhelmingly negative reviews. “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Secrets of Dumbledore” is the third film in the series and does not make a strong case as to why it should remain a part of the wizarding world. 
The film continues the story of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a renowned magizoologist as he attempts to help a young Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) defeat the growing threat coming from dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelson). Newt possesses a briefcase full of rare magical creatures that plays a big part in the grand scheme to take down Grindelwald.
Contrary to the cute furry creatures we’ve grown accustomed to from the first two movies, “The Secrets of Dumbledore” features terrifying new additions, such as an enormous spider-like creature in charge of killing its prisoners one by one and hordes of scorpions that Newt needs to entertain by moving just like them; darker creatures to fit the film’s darker themes. 
These themes correspond with an effort to make the franchise more relevant, as Rowling and Harry Potter producer Steve Kloves center the film around an election. The Wizarding World is seeking a new minister and has to choose between three candidates, including Gellert Grindelwald, who managed to embezzle his way into candidacy. The references to rigged elections and conspiracies are quite clear, as are the references to nefarious leaders of the past, with a large portion of the movie set in 1930s Berlin.
Grindelwald’s primary goal is to wage war against muggles, those who do not possess magical qualities. It draws parallels to recent conflicts involving white supremacy, with Grindelwald calling for domination over muggles and even, at points, calling them “animals.”
While the pandemic delayed the film for nearly two years, much of the anticipation surrounding its release was subdued due to a myriad of controversies. 
Warner Bros. requested that Johnny Depp, originally cast as Grindelwald, exit the franchise after he became embroiled in claims of being involved in incidents of domestic violence. Ezra Miller, who plays a big part in the series, was also arrested mere days before the premiere due to disorderly conduct. These incidents, plus the seemingly diminishing interest in the “Fantastic Beasts” series, caused concern for Warner Bros. as they staked a $200 million budget on the franchise. 
However, it’s not all doom and gloom for Potterheads who may be disappointed by this less than magical reception. “Secrets of Dumbledore” goes heavy on the nostalgia factor, as Newt and friends make an appearance at the beloved wizarding school Hogwarts for the first time in the series. 
The familiar Hogwarts’ towers and character references are enough to please avid Harry Potter fans who watched the film simply for sentimentality’s sake. How could you not smile when Dumbledore awards Newt three points to Hufflepuff after correctly answering a question? 
However, a rare sighting of young witches and wizards as Newt and his group make their way through Hogwarts reinforces the notion that this series has shifted its focus toward an older age group. It’s hard to imagine all the preteen Potter enthusiasts excited for a two hour and 23-minute political thriller. Though perhaps it’s an effort to interest its core fans who waited outside bookstores for a copy of the newest book when it first came out 25 years ago. 
Mikkelson as Grindelwald proves to be a good decision, as his charisma helps his role as a seductive politician whereas Depp’s interpretation of the character came off as simply unhinged. One character that continues to charm in the non-magical sense of the word is Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), a muggle who does his best to help the team and whose romance with witch Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) plays a central part of the film.
It’s during the film’s lighter moments that the nostalgia and charisma of the cast help it become genuinely entertaining while overlapping plot lines and characters make the movie  tiring at times. When the film isn’t trying to show off its massive budget, we catch a hint of the original series’ magic.
While “Secrets of Dumbledore” shows improvement over its predecessor, it doesn’t do enough to dispel questions of its relevance to the “Fantastic Beasts” series. Rowling, who also finds herself in the hot seat after repeated transphobic comments, would do best to separate herself from the series if the transphobic comments persist, and let other creatives rework the series so that it can achieve its full potential.
However, there is still enough magic to bring Harry Potter fans back to the big screen for more, as they continue to immerse themselves in the magical world that, for much of their childhood, was called home.

Prompted by the healthcare emergency in Ukraine — where there is an urgent need for supplies and support for citizens and refugees — students from the USC chapter of Blueprints for Pangaea donated USC Keck School of Medicine supplies to aid those impacted by the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict. Collecting 45 pallets of personal protective equipment and specialty materials, the chapter plans to ship 15 of these pallets Monday. 
The organization partnered with Not Just Tourists, a non-USC affiliated organization, to organize and ship materials to Ukraine. Using Not Just Tourists’ network, the club worked to provide supplies and find ways to get it to Ukraine. 
With help from Not Just Tourists, the club was able to identify and connect with representatives from organizations Hope2Ukraine, Nova Ukraine, Samaritan’s Purse and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, who would help ship supplies. 
Founded in 2020, the chapter of the organization aims to “redirect excess and unused medical supplies to areas of need,” according to Irene Li, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering and member of the operations team. The operations team of the fully student-run club is in charge of this coordination of shipments between donors and beneficiaries.
“When real time disasters happen and humanitarian crises occur, it’s really important that we respond very quickly,” said Asna Tabassum, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering and vice president of operations.
After taking inventory of the available supplies at Keck, the organization counted the 45 pallets consisting of personal protective equipment, including face masks, gloves and face shields. The pallets also comprised specialty materials such as syringes, HEPA filters, oral swabs, gauze and burn and wound care. Pallets are four-by-four square wooden frames used to store stacked boxes of supplies. Each pallet can get to be six to eight feet tall. 
Available supplies were either overpurchased by Keck during the pandemic or donated from local organizations such as churches and nonprofits. Some came from medical TV shows, such as “Grey’s Anatomy,” that dropped off supplies at the Keck warehouse when production stopped due to the pandemic. The hospital was not able to use these supplies for administrative reasons, so they were left unused and available. 
“A lot of companies just make an excess [of supplies] or hospitals may have excess that may expire soon or there’s a lot of regulations in regards to if it simply even enters patient rooms,” said operations team member Aivy Levan, a freshman majoring in biological sciences. “[Supplies] have to be thrown out, so we essentially take all of these excess supplies and redistribute them to other organizations.”
According to strict guidelines from the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, which includes an outline and guidance on supplies the country needs, a lot of personal protective equipment from international resources is not included. Expenses of shipping supplies from abroad are much higher than buying from neighboring European countries and then shipping the supplies directly through the borders. 
Therefore, not all of the Keck supplies will end up in Ukraine, said Krishni Satchi, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention. Instead, Blueprints for Pangaea is also working with Hope Beyond Borders to ship leftover supplies to Venezuela, where there is a high demand for personal protective equipment due to low medical access and low buying power. 
Since 2020, the chapter has donated 17,700 N95 masks and 800 sterile isolation gowns with a combined worth of more than $120,000 to eight nonprofit organizations. Most of the donated supplies went to help the unhoused community in Los Angeles, nonprofit organization volunteers and even some clinics in Mexico. 
“Blueprints [for Pangaea] has a really awesome mission, and our team has been working together super well and working on the fly,” Li said. “I don’t think initiatives like this would be able to happen without the hard work ethic of the rest of the operations team.”

“The true work of art is but a shadow of the divine perfection.”
These were the words of Michelangelo Buonarroti. For the man who depicted divinity on the walls and ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, such a standard for divine perfection seems appropriate. But he was not the only artist to hold this belief. 
Michelangelo has been referenced countless times throughout art and literature; however, one piece that clearly aligns with the artist’s perception of art being in the shadows is Oscar Wilde’s novel, “The Picture of Dorian Gray.”
This novel, a meditation on physical beauty, directly references Michelangelo within its first few chapters. The story centers around Dorian Gray, a young man renowned for his beauty, and Lord Henry, an older man in the same social circle as Dorian, analyzes how beauty is Dorian’s greatest asset and will allow him to accomplish whatever he wants in life. While contemplating the beauty of Dorian Gray, Lord Henry realizes that the patterns and shapes in life “were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real.”  
If this is not a clear enough evocation of Michelangelo’s outlook on art, then it is blankly stated when Lord Henry remembers “something like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence?”
Wilde also connects the shadow of the divine to Plato, whose philosophy stresses that art is a false knowledge of reality. Art is a mere reciprocation of what is real, not a further development of what is known to be true. 
This echoes Michelangelo once again, stressing that art, despite its beauty, will always be missing something. A fundamental level of truth is absent when man recreates something born of nature, which is why true art is a mere shadow of divine perfection. 
What connects Oscar Wilde, Michelangelo and Plato is their unanimous belief that, while art is limited, it offers a window into a universe of perfection unattainable to man. There is something about the divine perfection beyond conception that is generically appealing.  
The heart of man craves beauty just as he craves the divine. 
There is no denying the aesthetic appeal of beauty. When looking upon Michelangelo’s “David,” or standing under the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel, it is a momentarily transformative experience. The feeling of losing oneself in the narrative and life story of a piece of art is the closest experience one can have to something divine. It is the feeling, the emotion, the intangibility of the human experience that makes art worthwhile.
Going back to Plato’s philosophy and Michelangelo’s approach to art, this raises one fundamental paradox: Why is it that the most tangible things — a sculpture, a painting, a book — are the objects that can evoke the most intangible feelings of understanding, peace and pleasure in the human mind? 
“The Picture of Dorian Gray” addresses this through Dorian’s own obsession with physical beauty. The desire-turned-madness of his character to preserve youth and untouched beauty is forever symbolized through the role reversal of Dorian Gray — the person and the painting. 
Perhaps that is why art can be nothing more than a shadow of the divine. If man cannot bear the weight of such beauty, how are we meant to bear the weight of perfection? 
The inaccuracies and the inauthenticity of art are what tether it to earthliness and mankind. For every piece of art, there will be something to be improved and, as Plato said, every piece of art will replicate something already existing. 
It is the inability of man to create something so perfect and so new, yet have just enough beauty to be a reflection of the divine, that leaves art as a shadow of perfection. 
Still, artists strive to encapsulate and project the divine. But knowing that it is impossible to fully attain, art will forever remain in the shadows whilst making the world of perfection more real and desirable.

Bohemia is not dead; in fact, it lives on 25 years later. The “Farewell Tour” of the Broadway musical “RENT” made its way to Hollywood Boulevard this past weekend at the Dolby Theatre, reminding long standing and new fans why this Jonathan Larson classic is so beloved. 
Many of the cast members reprised their roles for this tour, including the one and only Angel played by Javon King who quite literally stole the show. King had played Angel on the 20th anniversary tour, and it’s no secret why he was asked to come back five years later. From her introduction in “Today For You,” Angel, a New York drag queen living with AIDS, lights up the stage with her song and dance in a Santa Claus costume singing “Today for you, tomorrow for me.”
Her solo emulated the original dance, jumping off tables, spinning in chairs and, of course, showcasing the six-inch heels. 
Angel’s musical partner and lover Tom Collins (Shafiq Hicks) also stole the show with his solo in the second act, “I’ll Cover You (Reprise).” Collins’ emotional performance after Angel’s death left a piercing pain throughout the theatre, the final note emulating the cry of grief. 
It’s no secret that the Collins and Angel love affair took center stage with beautiful ballads and their emotional connection of a “Queen” and “Moat.” It highlights why this musical in particular was so revolutionary. Not only does the diverse cast show different walks of life, it also shows various LGBTQIA+ relationships and humanizes the AIDS pandemic that disproportionately affected marginalized communities. 
Aiyana Smash debuted as Mimi  — a nickname I have adopted from the musical — five years ago. During the tour, she’s continued to keep the character’s spirit more than alive with solos “Out Tonight” and crowd favorite “Without You.” Both of these songs showcased Smash’s dynamism and versatility through playing an energetic 19-year-old who longs to go out and live life while  coping with addiction and an AIDS diagnosis.
“Without You,” featuring Angel in the hospital and Mimi falling into addiction once again after her falling out with Roger, specifically showcases the reality of the AIDS epidemic as this scene unfolds. 
Roger, played by Coleman Cummings, is the angsty, depressed rock artist who is overtaken by his past lover’s suicide and his own illness. Cummings does a good job of reprising the role of this beloved artist. One of the most notable artistic moments of the first act was the decision to have Roger play guitar in the background on stage as his friends went on with their lives to emulate how life went on around him. Often antisocial to a fault, Roger showcased the duality of life and death while maintaining a lighthearted drama-queen persona, the only bigger drama queen being Maureen. 
Maureen’s shoes are big ones to fill, ones Lyndie Moe has been in for two years. Originally played by Broadway queen Idina Menzel, the riffs and notes of this artist are difficult to hit and are often compromised. That was the case for Moe, who fell a bit flat playing this iconic character.
The tonality of “Take Me or Leave Me” was sung at an octave lower than the original, and the classic “Over the Moon” did not feel as funny as Menzel’s original as experienced from the movie adaptation. Despite the performance shortcomings while playing Maureen, it was still enjoyable to hear the auditorium “moo” at Moe at the end of the scene. 
Her snobby and, according to Maureen, “over attentive” duet partner, Joanne (Rayla Garske) was beautifully reprised and showcased the common struggles of women loving women relationships: tackling love with balance and patience. Emulating the stereotype of the “U-Haul” lesbians, the duo is both comedic and bring to the limelight a relationship that is often fetishized or misrepresented in an accurate manner. 
Although the musical deals with tough issues of death, “RENT” is ultimately about life. Mark, played by J.T. Wood, is a reminder that people live on in memories (and in film) and moments that they spend together will forever be a testament of their love. Playing Mark for the first time, Wood captured the awkward, yet distressed, artist who will be the only one who lives on from the cast as the rest will likely die from AIDS. Despite this sad reality and Angel’s death, the musical ends on a happy note with the revival of Mimi.
“To no absolutes, to choice,” Mark sang. “To being an us for once … instead of a them.” 
“RENT” paints a picture of the diverse manifestations of love and shows that one can have a fulfilled, happy life despite challenges of circumstance and loss. For this reason, Bohemia will forever live on even after the curtains close and the show’s retirement from Broadway.

“I had another protein bar for dinner.” I often send my mother this text, accompanied by a litany of complaints about dining hall food. By no means am I espousing this less than nutritious eating style, but it serves to highlight my resounding dislike for USC food. Admittedly, I have a very limited palette because of dietary restrictions, so I understand that I’m pickier than the average college student.
The basic level meal plan, the Cardinal Plan, costs $3,315 and includes 19 meal swipes per week. I’m often left with upward of 12 meal swipes by the end of the week. Based on conversations with my peers, they too often find themselves in the same boat. Unfortunately, all these unused meal swipes are deemed negligible by the end of the semester. While I try my best to use them for my friends without a meal plan who are struggling with food insecurity, I still end up with leftover swipes and feel like I’ve wasted my money. 
It’s important to note that a tenet of USC’s mission aims to promote “selected forms of public service.” Under the current meal plan, USC simply collects students’ money and does nothing with the remaining swipes, thereby situating the school as a money-hungry institution. To uphold its mission statement, USC should instead seriously consider adopting a new meal plan system.
After freshman year, it’s common for upperclassmen to opt for off-campus housing. With this comes the newfound responsibility of grocery shopping and cooking. It is understandably difficult for many college-aged students to contend with rent, tuition, groceries and all the supplementary costs of living in Los Angeles. USC can help mitigate this financial burden by revamping their meal plan so swipes roll over until one’s senior year. 
USC should also alter its meal plan because dining options on and around campus are often too expensive for students to afford. For example, I sometimes splurge on a simple SunLife oatmeal and small Dulce coffee in USC Village, but this breakfast usually turns into a $20 endeavor — hardly sustainable for the average college student. The meal options on campus are similarly overpriced. For example, for the better part of the year, I bought a small overpriced Annenberg coffee each morning. At $6.07 for a small iced coffee that takes me a few sips to finish, Annenberg’s prices exceed that of Alfreds or Kreation, quintessentially posh L.A. coffee shops. 
As of late, I recently discovered that Literatea accepts meal plan swipes for coffee orders. And while I’m overjoyed that I no longer have to dedicate all my money to overpriced Annenberg coffees, it’s ridiculous that I’m ostensibly paying the meal plan equivalent of $10 for a small drink. While C&G Juice Co. also has a meal swipe option for coffee and acai bowls, all dining options on campus should have more flexible options for students to choose how they want to spend their meal swipes or dining dollars. Whether it is with meal bundles or special combos, the University must ensuring that students are able to get enough food per meal swipe.
USC’s current meal program is riddled with flaws. Students already pay a whopping $85,648 in tuition costs. They shouldn’t be expected to shell out even more money to simply get a daily, nutritious meal. Therefore, to better cater to the students’ financial needs, USC must completely amend its meal plan and price options.

If nostalgia serves one function, it’s to distort the reality of the past. In the somewhat aftermath of one of the most emotionally, socially and financially taxing years around the world, many have taken to social media to reminisce on the “carefree” times of the initial lockdown. 
TikTok user @mafeanzures posted a video of her dancing, accompanied with text on the screen reading, “The way we took quarantine for granted makes me want to cry. There’s literally nothing I miss more than beginning of 2020. Quarantine felt like a well deserved break, time was not real, whipped coffee, this song, so many memories but none at the same time, our only responsibility was to stay home … and yet we still complained.”
Videos with similar — if not the same — sentiment began populating my For You page on TikTok, leaving me disturbed. How could we have all experienced such collective loss but, at the same time, begin romanticizing the pandemic?
Much to my surprise, @mafeanzures’ video alone garnered nearly one million likes. It was painful to witness so many people in the comments agreeing and showing their privilege on social media so shamelessly.
I was not the only one troubled by the increasing frequency of these videos as TikTok user @kattigemowijf commented, “idk why people feel like this. My mental health care stopped, I was terrified, felt trapped, etc” while @sunflwrcake responded, “You ain’t about to romanticize this. The fact nobody took it seriously is why we still here 2 years later.”
The people that have taken to social media to happily reminisce on the dumpster fire we called 2020 are seemingly blissfully unaware of the pain and sacrifices that many working-class individuals endured. 
The reality is that the pandemic devastated so many in the United States alone. The uncertainty at the beginning of the pandemic had my family, along with undoubtedly many other working-class families, wishing to stay at home to avoid catching the virus — however, as we all know, bills stop for no one — not even a global pandemic. So with this, three-fifths of my family, including myself, kept showing up to work. 
My part-time job at a local business I had previously loved working at quickly became exhausting, anxiety-inducing and eventually the reason for some of my worst memories during the pandemic. Frequently, I was met with rude customers who gave me some of their favorite choice of profanity when I’d ask them to simply adhere to our new lowered capacity or masking policy. My coworkers were stressed knowing that their second and third jobs were closing due to the pandemic — there was hardly any room to be carefree.
While working during the pandemic was a nightmare for many, home life wasn’t any better. School felt pointless, college applications felt like they would never end and isolation became overwhelming. Each day felt monotonous, and the only subject of conversation was the coronavirus or one of its subsidiary branches such as who had died that day.
Though at times I felt like I would die of boredom, I was grateful each day I was with my family. So many fail to realize the privilege it was to stay home during the pandemic. With 985,523 deaths and counting as of April 14 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, many essential workers could not afford that luxury and had to fight the coronavirus on the front lines. 
Even if the enormous loss of life was not a big enough indicator of the hardships during the pandemic, consider the political climate at the time. In the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement and presidential campaigns, Americans — especially people of color —  were fraught with the condition of the nation. If a public health crisis on top of a social justice crisis on top of a financial crisis is your idea of a “carefree” time that you wish to go back to, kindly, be my guest — but you must do it in the shoes of the hard-working individuals who carried us through the pandemic.
Videos such as the one described earlier are tone deaf at best, and they should not go uncriticized. Too many people exhausted themselves just to survive the pandemic for upper-middle class TikTokers to discredit their work, completely ignore the condition of the world and blatantly flaunt their privilege. It might have been more than two years since the start of the pandemic, but we cannot ignore the impact it had on all of our lives.

Friday night, I was in a limbo. 
I originally planned on using this space to call for Lakers owner Jeanie Buss to sell the team, but that topic was no longer important to me.
Granted, this was fresh off the Lakers firing Head Coach Frank Vogel in an embarrassing fashion. I had also grown tired of the reports of Buss’ friends such as Linda and Kurt Rambis having power within the organization. 
I was mad. But, this is a discussion for another day. My Twitter DMs are dangerously open if you’d like to discuss this though. 
I could have touched on the Clippers failing to make the NBA playoffs after losing two play-in games. For all the hate directed to the Lakers for having a disastrous season, the Clippers are in the same position as them — not in the playoffs. 
Why no uproar on Twitter? Well, I’m sorry friends. No one really cares about the Clippers like that to make a scene across social media. In 2020, we did, but not anymore.
Right when I was going to think, “Damn, I don’t have another idea I feel passionate about,” it came to me. How could I not have realized? 
This is the last column I’ll be writing as sports editor of the Daily Trojan, a position I have been so honored to be in and one I’ll cherish forever. 10 times out of 10 I’d do this again. It inclined me to reflect and take a look back at some fun, maybe repetitive, takes on Los Angeles sports. 
I’ve written 12 columns total as sports editor. As a die-hard Lakers fan, I’m proud to say only two columns were about the Purple and Gold. For this, I am a proud man because, well, I could write a column about the Lakers every day. 
The same number (two) have been about the Clippers, which is, hah, two more than I would have wanted to do. OK, but listen, listen, the Clippers are a fun team to follow, just not in L.A., alright? It’s a Dodgers/Lakers town, and maybe the Rams can sneak in there soon. Unfortunately for the Clippers, it’d be a smarter business decision to move somewhere else. 
Anyways, now that I’ve got that slander out of the way, the rest of my columns were strictly USC Athletics, something I felt was necessary to cover. See, at the Daily Trojan, there are columns on all sorts of topics — esports (my personal favorite), K-pop (second favorite), satire and advice. 
For me to stand out, I felt keeping it USC-specific would be fun. That’s what I strived to do. Plus, if you watched USC football in 2021, you would not struggle to find something to write a column about. 
There were some I loved more than others — my take on USC basketball winning the Pac-12 stands out — and some I wish I never wrote — writing that former quarterback Kedon Slovis would be the team MVP last year and not projected top-10 wide receiver Drake London. 
There were some that never saw the light of day too. 
Before it was announced that quarterback Jaxson Dart tore his meniscus and would be out indefinitely, I wrote an “Anthony on LA” calling for Dart to start over Slovis. While in the middle of production, though, we got the news. I sadly wrote a brief about the injury and scrapped that column. 
There was also the column about calling for USC to fire Clay Helton before they actually did. It would’ve been fun, I know it. There was also another asking USC to reevaluate basketball Head Coach Andy Enfield’s tenure with the Trojans. But, I came around to my senses and realized that’d be stupid. 
Being a sports editor is a lot of work; however, it’s extremely rewarding. 
There’s something about working on a product that is being cut rapidly across the country due to technology that makes it all worthwhile. There’s something about watching the growth of certain writers over the course of the semester that is amazing. And of course, there’s something about the fancy title of “sports editor” at a newspaper that is so respected among my peers.  
But — I’m nothing special, nor is my column. Any of you can be here with the right drive and dedication. And for that, I’m excited to see the future of this section.
Don’t you worry though this isn’t the end. Like the 38th Governor of California said: I’ll be back. 
Anthony Gharib is a junior writing about all things Los Angeles sports. His column, “Anthony on LA,” runs every other Monday. He is also the sports editor.

No. 1 beach volleyball emerged victorious in San Luis Obispo this weekend, sweeping the Center of Effort Challenge Tournament to extend their win streak to 26-straight duals.
The first win of the tournament came Friday afternoon, as USC narrowly defeated No. 6 Loyola Marymount 3-2, with points on court one from senior Tina Graudina and graduate Hailey Harward, court two from graduate Sammy Slater and sophomore Megan Kraft and court three from graduate Julia Scoles and sophomore Delaynie Maple. Both courts one and two went to three sets to collect their points.
“LMU is a really strong team, and it’s cool to see their program keep rising year after year,” said Harward, who, along with partner Graudina, makes up the reigning Pac-12 Pair of the Week. “They have really strong serves, and a lot of really skilled players and great coaches.”
LMU was the only team to earn 2 points off of USC during the tournament and the only team to score more than 1 point against the Trojans besides UCLA during their win back in March.
“We went into [the match against LMU] knowing that it would be a tough battle,” Slater said. “Having it come down to one last match, I think it showed us that we have what it takes in really tough times and when things get tight … I’m sure we’ll see them again at the National Championships.”
USC went on to sweep both No. 13 Cal Poly San Luis Obispo — the tournament’s host — and No. 4 Florida State, who the Trojans had already defeated once this season back in March.  
“It was really great to see the girls put things together and work on things, get better and then really show it on the court today,” said Head Coach Dain Blanton. “Every time this team steps onto the court, our big challenge is to make sure that we play the type of volleyball that we are capable of, and we know that everyone is going to kind of give us their best shot.”
The last game of the tournament set the Trojans up for a rematch with UCLA, who previously handed USC its only loss this season.
“We were disappointed in our performance the first time around because we didn’t play to our potential, so we knew that was half the battle,” Blanton said. “Taking care of our side of the net, coming in with the right mindset and really attacking — that’s really what the girls did, which was amazing. They attacked from the first whistle.”
The Trojans scored the first 3 points to clinch the match on court one, court three and court four. UCLA picked up its only point on court five before USC closed out the match with a 3-set win on court two.
“We’ve been waiting all season to be able to play them again,” Slater said. “We went out and didn’t feel like we had our best match against them last time, so we’ve really been working and training super hard to be able to come out and get a win like we did today.”
With only one regular season game left, the Trojans are gearing up for both the Pac-12 and National Championships coming up.
“Each pair just continues to make improvements on our own game,” Harward said. “All the teams are scouting us, and we’re scouting them, so [we’re] just trying to stay one step ahead on our side of the net.”
The Trojan will host their final regular season game at Merle Norman Stadium against UCLA at 1 p.m. Friday.
