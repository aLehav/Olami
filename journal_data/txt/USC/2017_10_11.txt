Nearly 20 percent of students at four-year universities experience some form of food insecurity, a lack of reliable access to enough affordable and nutritious food, according to statistics by the Challah for Hunger organization. 
Food insecurity is a nationwide phenomenon, and although USC is at the center of an urban cultural hub, students and South L.A. residents still struggle with locating affordable and nutritious food daily. 
Rachel Kartin, a junior majoring in religious studies, is working to change how USC  students view food insecurity through a campus chapter of Challah for Hunger, a nonprofit organization that advocates against hunger. In addition to its advocacy work, Challah for Hunger raises funds for anti-hunger organizations and MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger, its national partner. 
Although USC has resources dedicated to helping students facing food insecurity, such as the virtual food pantry offered by the Dornsife Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives and the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, an estimated 1.4 million people in Los Angeles County live with food insecurity, according to the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. 
“USC has an interesting dynamic,” Kartin said. “The school is very wealthy, but the surrounding area is not. This is something we need to be aware of. It would be really nice if through our advocacy, USC could begin to understand the issues that people who struggle with food insecurity have.”
Kartin also referenced the University’s virtual food pantry as a resource, but said the amount of food the pantry supplies on an emergency basis is not enough.  The pantry provides  a maximum of four $25 Trader Joe’s gift cards per semester and four over the summer.
“Food will still be something you’re focused on trying to obtain,” Kartin said.
The organization’s volunteers bake challah, a traditional Jewish sweet bread, every other Wednesday and sell them to students outside of the USC Hillel fundraiser for $5 the next day.
Of the money raised, half is donated to the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank and the other half to MAZON, which has already raised $1 million as a national organization.
“It’s a great organization incredibly close to USC and it serves the surrounding community,” Kartin said. “We work to raise awareness of food insecurity nationally, internationally and on campus and also to create a sense of community amongst our volunteers.”
Prior to transferring to USC as a junior, Kartin was involved in Challah for Hunger at Occidental College for two years. Challah for Hunger has 80 chapters on college campuses around the world and aims to engage students in philanthropy and activism.
“I’ve always been involved in advocacy and social justice programs,” Kartin said. “I knew that advocacy was something I was passionate about in general and [by being involved in Challah for Hunger] I was able to get involved in something I had the ability to advocate for.”
Also a member campaigning for the Campus Hunger Project, a national research project created by Challah for Hunger, Kartin works to investigate campus-wide issues involving food insecurity and ultimately provide  awareness to the struggles that many Trojans may face obtaining food on a daily basis.
“For me, at least, ‘Fight On’ doesn’t just apply to sports,” Kartin said. “It’s about striving to do more. We are a large, strong community that comes together to help others, our neighbors and those around us.”

USC hosted a groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the new Iovine and Young Hall on Wednesday at the intersection of Watt Way and Exposition Boulevard. The building is scheduled to open in 2019, and will host students from the Iovine and Young Academy — previously an interdisciplinary major, and now a full school at USC. 
Music producers Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young — also known as Dr. Dre — donated $70 million in 2013 to create the academy, according to USC News. Students who complete the highly selective program receive degrees in Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation, and came out of USC with at least one startup or idea in progress.
“I hope at this school, we can help our students to dream big, execute and build the courage to stay in the saddle,” Iovine said at Wednesday’s event. “I’m hoping that it will bring to them independence of thought to be able to work in the world between technology and liberal arts.”
President C. L. Max Nikias said USC started the Academy four years ago to create a revolutionary and disruptive program for students. 
He added that USC wanted to cultivate an academic environment where students could increase their capabilities and strengths in varying fields: the arts, humanities, business and technology. 
“Today, the Iovine Academy begins a new chapter — breaking ground on the kind of home that its spectacular students deserve,” Nikias said in his opening statement.
“I think [the new hall] will be a way of making the academy more ‘official’ at USC,” said Valentina Suarez, a sophomore majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation. “Once the building is up, I’ll be excited to just be able to go in and work in the workshops or do homework in the study rooms.” 
Academy students currently have a temporary workspace called “The Garage” in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. 
Every year, The Garage has a blank mural wall for students to draw out designs in order to foster their creativity and artistic abilities. The Garage features computer workstations, 3D scanners and printers, studios and labs. 
Iovine and Young Hall’s new, estimated 10,000-square-foot space will include labs and studios to record music and to create films, six classrooms and study spaces. 
“The new hall is going to open a ton of new opportunities for creative makerspace,” said Anthony Yin, a sophomore majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation. “The IYA Hall is going to have a great studio for sound recording, which is very important for me because I do a lot of music-related extracurriculars.”
After Nikias’ opening speech, Iovine spoke about how he and Young wanted to create the school in order to start a new paradigm for academic achievement. Iovine said he supported the endeavors and innovation ideas for all the current and future Academy students. Then, Nikias gifted a colored drawing of the new hall to Iovine and Young. 
While this year’s Academy graduates will not be able to experience the new building, a USC Alumni Lab will be created for them to use. 
The ceremony ended with Iovine and Young Academy Dean Erica Muhl, Iovine, Young and Nikias “breaking the ground,” and a performance by the Trojan Marching Band.

Chairman and Trustee Edward Roski Jr. was awarded the Circle of Honor Award from the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation this weekend. 
The Roski School of Fine Arts was renamed after him and his wife after they donated $23 million in 2006. Roski is also the co-owner of the Los Angeles Kings, Los Angeles Lakers and the STAPLES Center.
 The Circle of Honor Award is the Medal of Honor Foundation’s most distinguished award. It acknowledges Americans who have made a contribution to the United States, and who demonstrate the principles of courage, sacrifice, service and patriotism, according to a Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation’s press release.
Roski is a Marine Corps veteran and received two Purple Hearts in Vietnam after serving from 1962 to 1966.
Roski initiated the Majestic Realty Foundation whose charitable giving and community outreach in Los Angeles focus on youth, family, education, health and violence prevention.
The Congressional Medal of Honor Society was chartered in 1958 by Congress to form a brotherhood among living Medal of Honor recipients to maintain the distinction of the Medal and promote citizenship in the youth. 
“I’m deeply humbled by this recognition from the Medal of Honor Foundation,” Roski said at the awards ceremony. “It’s a real tribute to the patriotism, leadership and opportunity in our city.”

The USC football team rebounded solidly from its first loss of the season, beating Oregon State at home 38-10 on Saturday. Now, the Trojans turn their focus to Utah, which was undefeated and ranked No. 18 in the country until a 23-20 loss to Stanford last week.
Injury News
Head coach Clay Helton said that redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe is getting closer to returning to play, and that the goal was to have him back against Notre Dame next week. Imatorbhebhe, who hasn’t played since the Week 1 victory over Western Michigan, caught four of his 17 receptions for touchdowns last year. His return could help the team’s red zone woes, which Helton said would be a focus in Thursday’s practice.
“He’s a little bit ahead of schedule, he’s feeling good right now,” Helton said. “We’ll listen to him and see where his body is. He’s got a lot of game experience, is a tremendous run blocker and you saw him as a threat in the passing game last year.”
After practicing Tuesday, junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett was kept out of practice Wednesday with a sore shoulder and toe. Burnett has caught 41 passes for 527 yards and six touchdowns this season, which are all team highs.
Junior offensive lineman Chuma Edoga returned to practice Wednesday for the first time since sustaining an ankle injury two weeks ago versus Washington State. Sophomore linebacker Jordan Iosefa and redshirt junior wide receiver Jalen Greene are still in concussion protocol after colliding during pregame warmups against Washington State. 
Preparing For Utah
Wednesday’s practice saw a few areas of focus in response to the match-up with the Utes. Helton said that Utah’s punt return game is “tremendous,” so the team spent extra time on special teams coverage. Utah ranks  No. 11 in the country in punt return yards per game at 15.8.
In addition,  Helton said that the team ran one-on-one drills in preparation for Utah’s blitz packages, as well as to continue the Trojans’ defensive success up front. The starters went up against each other at the end of practice as a way of preparing for Utah’s pass rush.
“We needed the best look,” Helton said. “Iron sharpens iron. It’s a very good Utah defense that applies a lot of pressure on third down and in the red zone, so I wanted the tackles to see great edge rush from [senior linebacker] Uchenna [Nwosu] and others on our defense,” 
Utah ranks No. 21 in the nation in total defense through six weeks, giving up just 314 yards per game.
The Trojans head into the game not knowing who Utah’s starting quarterback will be between injured starter Tyler Huntley and backups Troy Williams and Cooper Bateman. Williams, Utah’s starter last season, was intercepted twice in last week’s loss to Stanford while filling in for Huntley, which makes the Utes’ quarterback competition uncertain for this week.

After a three-week break, women’s cross country will compete on Saturday at the UC Riverside Highlander Invitational. With a goal of gradual and consistent improvement, head coach Patrick Henner says the team will continue to refine racing tactics at the meet.
“One of the biggest or most important skills we’ve been working on is learning how to build intensity throughout the race,” Henner said. “So to start mentally and physically relaxed, and then as you move through the 5K race this Saturday, try to build intensity every 1,000 [meters] so that you’re running your hardest in the last 1,000.”
Henner said the strategy builds on the same race plan from the UNLV Invitational, where the Trojans placed fourth overall. He noted the team’s top three finishers — junior Amber Gore, junior Lauren Maurer and freshman Jennifer Daly — executed this plan well at UNLV. On Saturday, Henner expects the trio to build on this success, while he also looks for improvement from the back half of the team.
“My philosophy is that to have a really good cross country team, everybody has to go out and execute the race plan and give a really good effort,” Henner said. “And that’s something that’s always 100 percent under your control. So, if you can do that, and you have all your top five or seven do that, then the scoreboard’s going to take care of itself.”
After the Highlander Invitational, the Trojans will compete at the Cal State Fullerton Titan Invitational before moving on to their Pac-12 conference meet and NCAA West Regionals. Instead of viewing these meets as an end, Henner said he wants the team to focus on the overall process of the season.
“Distance running is a long-term investment,” Henner said. “It’s not a short-term game. So we just want to look to get better physically and mentally, every single training block, every single race, and really not look at the end of the season as the end of anything. It’s just like, ‘Hey, that’s a building block, now we can move into indoors and keep working on those same skills.’”

After spending the first five weeks of the football season watching from home, former Trojan Darreus Rogers will officially join the NFL this week. The wide receiver signed with the Chicago Bears on Wednesday as an undrafted free agent. 
Rogers will join the team’s practice squad after an announcement from the team confirmed that they had released wide receiver Deonte Thompson and promoted wide receiver Tanner Gentry to the official roster. He wasn’t picked up in the 2017 NFL Draft but earned a spot on the training camp roster with the Seattle Seahawks. However, the team waived Rogers in early September before final roster cuts, leaving him without a home for this season. 
He will now join the Bears, who sit at fourth in the NFC North with a 1-4 season record, as a potential target for first round quarterback pick Mitch Trubisky. 
Despite struggling with injuries, Rogers played an important role in the Trojans’ offense throughout his four years at USC. After grayshirting in 2012, he played 11 games as a freshman but missed three weeks due to an injury to his right ankle. As a sophomore, Rogers played 13 games and started in three, then moved into a more permanent starting role in his junior year. In his third season, Rogers started in 11 games and roped in 28 catches for 289 yards and three touchdowns despite battling recurring hamstring injuries.
Last season, Rogers was a standout for the wide receiving corps as redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold came into his own. Rogers snagged 56 catches for 696 yards and four touchdowns, coming second on the team only behind JuJu Smith-Schuster, who now plays a vital role in the Pittsburgh Steelers offense.
Rogers is now one of over 40 former Trojans playing on practice squads and official rosters throughout the NFL. He joins former teammates such as Adoree’ Jackson, Chad Wheeler and Stevie Tu’ikolovatu.

I don’t really understand how national rankings work.
Of course, I understand the premise of voters and polls based on point differentials and strength-of-schedule statistics. I’ve read plenty of explainer columns that break down the variety of factors that are put into deciding the national rankings for teams every week. 
But when it comes down to it, national rankings are consistently subjective. How do you judge the quality of dozens of football teams playing wildly different matchups? How do you factor in the effects of injuries and away games, or the impact of a short week for a Friday night matchup? Is a win over a No. 3 team really that much more important than a win over a No. 6 team?
The list of questions goes on and on, but at the end of the day, the same general conclusion can be drawn. The AP and Coaches’ Polls are many things, but most often, they’re inaccurate in some way or another. And the place where these rankings cut the least slack is the Pac-12.
Last week, Washington fans exploded on social media after a barrage of comments from ESPN about the team’s opening schedule. The fans’ reactions ramped up to full-on outrage when ESPN commentator Quint Kessenich compared the first three teams of the Huskies’ season to a trio of vanilla cupcakes on air during the channel’s broadcast of the game.
The comments came after Washington head coach Chris Petersen bemoaned the East Coast broadcasting bias that causes big-ticket Pac-12 games to kick off as early as 11 a.m. on some weekends. Commentator Kirk Herbstreit fired back on ESPN College Gameday, saying coaches should be “thanking ESPN” for covering the games at all. Another commentator described Petersen as “irascible and cantankerous.”
Fans lashed out on Twitter, but the flames died down quickly after several days, especially after Washington beat down Cal in a 38-7 victory. It’s easy to not be angry, of course, when your team is ranked at the top of the Pac-12 and the top 5 of both national polls. But whether it’s noticeable or not, the Pac-12 suffers from the same bias that Petersen cited from top to bottom. And this season, the Trojans have taken some of the harder hits.
In making this argument, of course, I have to acknowledge the struggles of this year’s USC football team. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold has underperformed mightily, tumbling from the inarguable Heisman frontrunner to simply become a competent quarterback (this is something, however, that still shouldn’t be taken for granted). 
Injuries have plagued the front five of the offensive line, and special teams have been mediocre at best. The defense has been the sole highlight of this year’s season, and that’s rather reflective of the lack of success of a team that was most touted for its offense before the season.
So no, I’m not here to claim that USC deserves better than its current ranking. But last week, a specific game reminded me of how quickly and mightily the Trojans will be punished for taking losses that are rather typical in a competitive conference.
After bobbing up and down in the top 10, the Trojans tumbled nine places from No. 5 to No. 14 after losing to Washington State. It was an understandable drop to take — after all, the team had been cruising for a bruising for weeks after kicking off the season by struggling to put away Western Michigan at home. 
But the Cougars weren’t exactly cupcakes. At the time, the team was ranked No. 16, and since then has climbed to No. 8. Quarterback Luke Falk is a certified superstar, rising from walk-on status to pass Marcus Mariota in the Pac-12 all-time passing records as he quickly becomes a sleeper candidate for the Heisman. Combine that with the fact that the Trojans had to travel to Pullman, Wash. on a short schedule while dealing with a litany of injuries — and a staph infection — and the loss is rather understandable.
You know what’s not understandable? A No. 3 team with a Heisman frontrunner falling to an unranked opponent’s second-string quarterback at home. That’s what happened last Saturday when Iowa State upset Oklahoma in Norman, Okla. Of course, this is part of the beauty of college sports — pretty much any team can beat any other team on any given Saturday, regardless of rank or Heisman candidacy. 
But what’s even harder to understand is how the same Sooner team somehow only fell to No. 12. That’s right — a loss to an unranked, battered team at home dropped Oklahoma the exact same number of spots as a loss on the road to an up-and-coming team did to USC.
After Saturday’s game, senior captain Chris Hawkins shook his head in frustration as he considered the next week’s rankings, which had yet to be released.
“They don’t take us seriously,” he said with a shrug.
Hawkins was right. The polls don’t take this team seriously, and they might not for the rest of the season. But national voters would be foolish to turn their TVs off before catching this weekend’s Pac-12 games — especially when it comes to the Trojans.
With the offense slowly warming up, and key players returning from injury, this team is on the cusp of reclaiming its preseason glory. Darnold has settled into solid production; the young corps of receivers grows every week, and the defense remains one of the most formidable in the country.
The time for underestimating USC has officially come to its end. Let’s hope that next week’s polls will take due note.

Jake Tribus has received a lot of buzz around the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance lately — for good reason. 
Tribus, a sophomore majoring in dance, already has an extensive career; he has trained with the CC & Company Dance Complex since sixth grade and danced in Taylor Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” music video in August. In addition, Tribus was named the New York City Dance Alliance’s Teen Male Outstanding Dancer and the National Teen Male Non-Stop Dancer for 24/Seven Dance Convention, and he apprenticed with the Next Generation Ballet program at the Patel Conservatory. He also co-founded Artists Giving Hope, a nonprofit organization dedicated to “encouraging artists to come together to inspire people to act with compassion and kindness, regardless of race, gender, sexuality or beliefs,” according to its website.
The Daily Trojan interviewed Tribus to uncover the origins of his relationship with dance and understand how he has reached this exciting, upward-trending point in his career.
Daily Trojan: What first got you into dance, and why did you choose to stick with it?
Jake Tribus: Ever since I was little, I was dancing whenever there was music playing. I have home videos of me doing the robot to NSYNC and Britney Spears in the living room. It wasn’t until around fifth grade that I actually started dancing. My best friend decided to use “Bring A Friend to Class” day as an excuse to bring me, and I instantly fell in love with it.
DT: Who were some of your biggest influences growing up, and how did they contribute to bringing you to where you are now?
JT: Both of my parents danced when they were in high school. My dad was heavily involved in musicals, so he was the classic triple threat — he sang, acted and danced. My mom was a gymnast and dancer growing up, and convinced me to participate in gymnastics for a while before I started dancing. I continue to use some of my tumbling and acrobatics in my dancing to this day. My studio owner, Christy Curtis, was definitely an inspiration and motivator for me as I developed through high school into wanting to pursue dance as a career. She presented an endless amount of opportunities for all her dancers, and without her training, guidance and love, I wouldn’t be the dancer I am today.
DT: How do you think you have evolved as a dancer since attending Kaufman?
JT: Since being at Kaufman, I have developed not only physically as a dancer, but intellectually. We pride ourselves on being both dancers and scholars in the Kaufman program and I take both of those roles very seriously. I found that I am not only growing in my ability to perform complicated movements and harder repertoires from contemporary companies, but in my ability to understand the history of dance and how to use my body. Having the requirement of taking other general education courses allows us to combine other fields of study with dance as well. This leads to countless discoveries and uses for the art form that aren’t typically considered conventional.

DT: What has been the highlight of your dance career so far?
JT: When looking back through my dance career thus far, I think of three performances that I will never forget. The first was being able to perform “Rhythm Nation” alongside Janet Jackson on her tour when she visited Raleigh, N.C. She selected a group of dancers from my studio to learn the choreography and perform it with her and her dancers on stage for the show. The second performance was a show put together by the Emmy Award-winning choreographer Travis Wall called Hollow Suit for Dancerpalooza in Long Beach last summer. I was honored to play Travis as an 18-year-old in the show, highlighting his childhood and performing alongside some of my best friends and mentors. The third highlight was being a part of Taylor Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” music video that premiered at the beginning of September of this year. Being on set with her and the other dancers was a dream.
DT: How did you come across the opportunity to dance in Taylor Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” music video? What was the experience like?
JT: For the “Look What You Made Me Do” music video, I was chosen by Taylor’s choreographer, Tyce Diorio. I [took] his class growing up on the dance convention scene, and he had seen some of my dance videos on my Instagram page. He messaged me asking if I would like to be a part of the project, and we were able to make it work around my school schedule. It was an unbelievable experience! This was my first music video job, and getting to work with a professional artist like Taylor was a dream come true. I love doing commercial work, and the other dancers in the video are some that I have looked up to for a long time. It was so exciting. I don’t think it actually hit me that it was real until I saw myself in the video.
DT: What’s your favorite style of dance and genre of music to dance to? Do you have any favorite jams?
JT: I would consider myself a very versatile dancer, trying to train in many styles ranging from ballet to contemporary to hip hop. If I had to choose one, I would say that contemporary work is my favorite to perform and explore. I love the freedom contemporary movement gives you, and I love being able to transform into something or someone else when I’m performing. In terms of music, I listen to about anything besides country and heavy metal. Some of my favorite artists include BANKS, Sia, Galantis and Lady Gaga. If you haven’t heard it, listen to “Underdog” by BANKS. I have had it on repeat.
DT: When you’re not dancing, what are you doing?
JT: Because of the crazy busy Kaufman schedule, when I’m not dancing, I’m typically doing homework or sleeping. But if I ever get time on a weekend to relax, I love to find new music, lay out at the beach, go see a movie with my best friend or explore Los Angeles!

DT: Do you have a “dream production” you would love to be a part of? What is it and why?
JT: I have two dream jobs that I would love to make happen at some point in my career. One is more concert dance-based, and the other is more commercial. First, I would love to be a company member with the Nederlands Dans Theatre. It is my favorite contemporary company based in Amsterdam. I have participated in its summer intensive before, and I fell in love with the work. The second job would be to book a world tour with either Beyoncé or Lady Gaga. I love both of their music so much, and getting to travel the world with them and a group of talented dancers would be the best experience ever.
DT: What’s something most people do not know about you?
JT: I love to bake. I lived in Hawaii. My brother is a fashion designer. I have never owned a dog, but have desperately wanted one my whole life. I am a self-taught makeup artist and did the makeup for my high school’s production of Beauty and the Beast for my senior year. Some of my weaknesses include chocolate and ice cream. I really do not like the texture of Jell-O. I love taking naps, and can fall asleep almost anywhere. I was almost named Christopher.
DT: Lastly, what does dance mean to you?
JT: I have said this for a while, and I think it really aligns with both how I view dance and why I dance: Dance is a way for me to become whoever or whatever I want, while simultaneously being 100 percent authentically myself. 
Oh the places you will go Jake! Loved this article and may have to taste some of that baking when you are in town!!  Christopher huh! We love to watch you on stage, you take us to another place! We love you so much Jakey Poo!!

To be perfectly frank, I was very prepared to be completely snarky about indie singer-songwriter Alex Cameron’s album Forced Witness. While I thoroughly enjoyed the Australian Cameron’s first record — namely, the songs “Real Bad Lookin’” and “Take Care of Business” — I was prepared for this record to be an ostentatious, over-the-top concept project that was more style and caricature than substance.
To offer some background, Cameron adopts a satirical persona in his music — that of a sleazy, washed-up musician. This is evident in the cover art of both Forced Witness and his 2016 album Jumping the Shark. On Jumping the Shark, he sports a long, greased-back hairdo with large black aviators and absurdly pronounced acne scars. However, the Forced Witness artwork suggests an evolution, as Cameron is dressed in a similar fashion (a leather jacket with a turtleneck and sunglasses) but his environment has changed. Now, Cameron stands with his back to a window where adoring fans shove their hands through the shades to snap a picture with their phones. This reflects the progression of his work as a whole, as in his first album the character he plays is more insecure and despondent.  In one of his first singles from Jumping the Shark, he sings, “I used to be the number one entertainer, now I’m bumpkin with a knife / I’ll never get my show back.” However, he has turned a leaf and is displaying his confident, even more unsavory side in his new release. 
His persona is perfectly manageable in small doses, but in a full-length album it becomes tired and obnoxious after a few tracks. Admittedly, he avoids being totally corny while maintaining some of the acerbic humor of this character at times and in certain instances, the wit of his role is his record’s saving grace. But many of the tracks are imperfect and Cameron’s humor can’t really save the excessive piggishness of it all. Indeed, this project is flawed, as at times the lyrics go too far in being smarmy. 
Take “Studmuffin96” for instance. The first verse goes, “But I keep my money in the bank / p-ssy in the bed / liquor out of reach.” And in the chorus he sings, “I’m waiting for my lover / She’s almost 17 / Surrounded by the vision / Of a thousand fantasies.” I understand that this is all essentially parodying the gnarly way in which most classic rock music sexualizes young girls and groupie culture. But in attempting to subvert these problems and stereotypes, Cameron is just reinforcing them. Not to be a wet blanket, but it is often difficult to find humor in satire that is so close to home that it might as well not be satire at all. A white guy objectifying women in order to make fun of other white guys objectifying women isn’t subversive, and it’s still gross, no matter the greater satirical intention. 
The bright spots of the record include “Runnin’ Outta Luck” which pays homage to upbeat power ballads of the ’80s, but is infused with a singer-songwriter sensibility and features a ripping sax solo at the end. The synth paired with the four-on-the-floor bass beats make it irresistibly danceable, and its repetitive chorus makes it annoyingly catchy as well. The lyrics in this track are not as vomit-inducing as some of the more greasy, almost malicious songs. This track embodies what the vision of the album as a whole seems to be: Poking fun at the ridiculous faux masculinity of a failing rock has-been. This chorus expresses this well: “I’m a man on a mission, you’re a stripper out of luck / And we’re good in the backseat but we’re better upfront / And there’s blood on my knuckles ’cause there’s money in the trunk.” It’s silly and formulaic and cinematic in a wonderfully fun way at no one’s expense. The music video, too, is hilariously awkward, as we watch a lanky, wife beater-clad Cameron shimmy and vogue on the beach and on the sidewalk.
All in all, while there are certainly some gems on this record, Cameron would do well to focus less on making a comment on the absurdity of masculinity in pop culture, as it can overshadow the legitimate quality of his sound.

Wanting He | Daily Trojan
Presented by the School of Cinematic Arts’ Council on Diversity & Inclusion, writer and director Gina Prince-Bythewood spoke at the Albert & Dana Broccoli Theatre on Tuesday evening. She provided insights on the career she’s built in spite of dismissive production companies, dicey encounters with male industry moguls and even an initial rejection from UCLA’s School of Theater, Film and Television, her alma mater. 
As the creator of many influential films casting African American leads, such as Love and Basketball, The Secret Life of Bees and Beyond the Lights, and a recipient of an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay and a Humanitas Prize, Prince-Bythewood has amassed an impressive filmography and recently became the first woman of color to direct a superhero movie, with a Spiderman spin-off in the works. 
Growing up, Prince-Bythewood immersed herself in soap operas as a form of escapism from a less-than-ideal childhood experience, which led her to develop an affinity for storytelling in the form of screenwriting.
As a filmmaker who is passionate about addresing social justice issues and social consciousness, she is passionate about creating works that don’t just serve as entertainment.
“Our country is in dire straits and we can use art to change the world,” Prince-Bythewood said.
She also focuses on extensive character development, emphasizing the importance of having her audience imagine the life of a character that continues beyond the screen.  
 “I want characters to be real, with a background,” Prince-Bythewood said. “I think about their religion, hobbies, favorite food [and] favorite color.”
She said that at a time when people of color lack meaningful representation on the screen, Prince-Bythewood strives to transcend racial and gender stereotypes without making it the central trope of the show or movie, crafting nuanced characters to change how race and gender are represented on screen.
“I want to put us [black women] in films and see ourselves reflected on screen, because we don’t get enough movies made about us,” Prince-Bythewood said. 
She criticized production companies for placing more faith and capital in films with white protagonists because they’re  “more universally relatable” as a “self-fulfilling prophecy” that unfairly denotes gems of black cinema.  As a black woman, Prince-Bythewood is not only a formidable presence in the film and television industry, but also an artist who allows the masses to sympathize on a deeply human level through minority leads, letting viewers become aware of their own political realities. Her TV series Shots Fired addresses police brutality and represents the advocacy of the Black Lives Matter movement.
A recurring theme during the Q&A with the filmmaker was an unwavering perseverance in the face of adversity and a fierce integrity toward her work. The exhausting hustle of pitching scripts to production companies who didn’t believe in her vision, especially in an industry known for its devaluation of the contributions from women and people of color, did not sway her into compromising her ideas or artistic approach. Rather, Prince-Bythewood stood by her work and took matters into her own hands. When Sony Pictures dropped her pitch for Beyond the Lights, she decided to shoot a short film based on the movie with money out of her own pocket and granted it to BET, which then got on board and gave her a $2 million budget to produce the movie. 
Speaking from her own experiences, she urges filmmakers to trust their instincts, especially during the initial stages of a project. 
“Come at it with what you want to see — you’re the first audience,” Prince-Bythewood said. 
She said her first concern is not whether or not production companies will have confidence in her ideas or whether the movie will even gain fame or commercial success, but rather if it resonates with her on a personal level. Even being on bed rest post-surgery did not keep her from attending production meetings, something she says she tells people when they say women aren’t tough enough to be directors. 
At the event, Prince-Bythewood was asked how she’d like to affect the industry after having led such an impressive career, she offered an earnest, genuine piece of advice
 “Have integrity and give back to people,” Prince-Bythewood said. “Stay true to yourself and remember where you came from.”

Last month, The New York Times published an article highlighting a racial punishment gap in public secondary education. In 2012, black students in Arkansas were suspended from school more than five times as often as white students and received corporal punishment almost twice as often as white students. Additionally, black students were more likely to be punished for minor infractions. In the 2008-2009 academic year, black students in North Carolina public schools faced suspension rates eight times higher for cell phone use, six times higher for dress code violations, twice as high for disruptive behavior and 10 times higher for displays of affection than their white counterparts. Minor academic punishment often leads to more major punishment, which can dramatically affect students’ future academic prospects, college admissions and the trajectory of their professional lives.
Landmark cases like Brown v. Board of Education and Lau v. Nichols clearly indicate that the U.S. education system has a troubled and racist history. What began as white backlash for integrated schools now seems to have transformed into implicit and explicit biases with serious consequences for minority students. When policies are unfairly enforced, faculty and administrative expectations significantly affect student performance. 
These practices and biases have a lasting effect on minority students, and the consequences linger with them into their college careers. Though policies in primary schooling may not seem significant, they have a lasting impact on young people’s self-esteem and attitudes toward education.
To combat this harmful cycle of inequality, teachers must become aware of inherent biases and proactively tackle them. Until administrators, parents and students acknowledge that there is a systemic problem with how minority students are more likely to be perceived as dangerous or rebellious, the injustice they face will continue to go ignored. Teachers and educators must have mandated anti-racism training to understand how and why unfair punishments affect student performance and future academic and professional pursuits. Only situational training and putting this training into practice will address the racial divide in education.

Several schools have instituted policies such as restorative practices and a method known as Positive Behavior Intervention and Support. A report by the Arkansas Advocates for Kids and Families described restorative practices as a method using peer juries and training-based punishments rather than suspension and expulsion. Restorative practices focus on social cooperation, responsibility and unifying solutions to the issues underlying the school-to-prison pipeline. PBIS focuses on modeling positive behavior rather than relying on punishment. Such policies could have an equalizing effect in schools. 
Integration of minorities in schools — particularly in states like California — has not improved and in some cases, has worsened. A 2014 report by the UCLA Civil Rights Project claimed the average Latinx student attends a school with a population that is only 15.6 percent white. Additionally, black and Latinx students attend schools where, on average, more than two-thirds of students come from impoverished families, while only one-sixteenth of black students attend schools that are majority white. Separate but equal is seen as an issue of the past, not a lingering reality for students across the country, and even in California, a state that prides itself on diversity and social progress. Until minority students are no longer segregated into low-income, poorly funded schools, the culture of punishment and racial disparity in schools will continue to stall.
Until actual policies are implemented to narrow the achievement gap, by fixing the school-to-prison pipeline and changing the way minority students are viewed, universal success for children will never be achieved. Until teachers are given ample resources to provide the best educational experience for their students, they will continue to get frustrated with the system and eventually leave. There is no way to fix the broken educational system and eliminate institutionally biased practices until there is proactive leadership from the top to better fund and restructure the education system. 
 
In New Jersey, the state police was accused of being “racist” or “prejudice” because according to the charge Blacks were disproportionately ticketed for speeding. Well they did a study, it turns out that Black people were more increasingly likely to speed than whites. I find a similar solution to this. Are they punished more, perhaps if the data you said is true. But I think if we look at the details we’ll find that Black students generally misbehave more than whites because of the lefts battle to label the establishment as “racist” and “anti-black”. Not to mention the general piece of black behavior brought on by cultural norms to disrespect authority.
Your article is absurd.Your entire point about bias in punishment hedges all bets on a logical fallacy. Discrepancies in the rates of certain punishments DOES NOT INDICATE that there is a bias in how the administration of these schools allocates punishments.
The SJWism is laughable.
there’s a really scary disconnect from reality here, maybe you can look at some of the science on racial differences? Let me help you on one thing: the purpose of segregated schools was to protect white children from black violence.
Let’s start here:  Find a way to compel black men to stay home with the families they spawn. Next up:  providing school vouchers enabling parents to divert their kids from failed schools. Unionized public education was doomed from the start.  I have 3 members of my family working in public education (2 teachers and a middle-school principal).  All chose public education as their vocation not because they care about educating kids, but rather, because they wanted to be taken care of.  Join a union if you please, but that makes you a vocational coward. Total job security uber alles…..right!

America’s favorite “large adult son” and “very good boy” Donald Trump Jr. took a page from his father’s book this weekend, taking to Twitter to blast left-leaning politicians and celebrities alike for failing to immediately comment on sexual assault allegations against Hollywood producer and Democratic donor Harvey Weinstein. 
“Thoughts on Harvey Weinstein?” he tweeted at public figures ranging from comedian Jimmy Kimmel to former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, a beneficiary of Weinstein’s political fundraising.
Put simply,  the younger Trump reacted to news of the suffering and oppression experienced by dozens of women in the entertainment industry the way children react to Christmas morning. And sure, there’s a lot to unpack here, but for starters, if you’re going to pretend to care about societal misogyny and the sexual subjugation of women, it would be a lot more convincing if you actually showed some remorse. The president’s oldest son certainly wasn’t this happy — nor this loud — at this time last year when leaked Access Hollywood tapes revealed his father had boasted about how his celebrity status allowed him to nonconsensually grope women, and over a dozen women came forward to accuse the then-Republican presidential nominee of sexual misconduct.
But the president’s son is hardly alone in taking this episode reflective of a larger epidemic in patriarchal society and leveraging it for political gain. Following reports from The New York Times and The New Yorker detailing Weinstein’s actions, the National Republican Congressional Committee called on Congressional Democrats to return all funding from Weinstein. Indeed, perhaps Democrats should, but the demand is ironic coming from the party that rewarded a man with the same record as Weinstein with its nomination, and then with the presidency.
It’s important to remember allegations against Weinstein have nothing to do with party politics, where allegations against President Donald Trump dominated and continue to dominate the national political dialogue because the way our president and elected representatives view women affects us all. But where Weinstein is concerned, revelations against the influential Hollywood producer speak to an issue that transcends politics — that is, whether or not we as a society trust and respect women. And as dismal as this may sound, the dark reality is that we continually fail to. There’s no shortage of people and historical traditions to blame for this, but the decades-long Republican war on women is one starting point. 
There are a lot of reasons that women who experience sexual harassment and assault don’t come forward. A crucial one is that despite the exhaustiveness of the reporting process, many cases often go dismissed or are swept under the rug. This is exponentially more likely when the assailant is male, wealthy and powerful. Weinstein and Trump may not be united by party, but they are united by the extent to which male privilege — in a society built on the social and political disenfranchisement of women — has allowed them to act without consequences.
For years, that social and political disenfranchisement has been propagated by the party that unapologetically handed Trump the presidency, where, at the very least, Democratic stars and politicians have come out in droves to unequivocally disavow Weinstein. For years, policies and rhetoric by Republican lawmakers related to American women have been united by a common theme — that women cannot be trusted. 
Following core conservative ideology, women cannot be trusted to make basic bodily decisions; instead, the government must make these decisions for them and hamper their access to the resources requisite to their autonomy.
In both the House and state legislatures across the country, bills to invest in rape kits and provide survivors with additional resources have repeatedly been shut down by Republican lawmakers. Republican lawmakers in the state of Texas recently passed legislation that would require women to buy separate insurance plans in order to receive abortion coverage, with no exceptions for cases of rape. The bill was widely criticized for ignoring the fact that women have no power over whether or not they are subjected to rape and sexual assault. And that is the core of the right wing assault on women’s rights — a ruthless approach that involves not only victim-blaming, but also the punishment and neglect of women with unwanted pregnancies and of women who are abused by men. 
Trump said in 2016 that if his daughter Ivanka faced sexual harassment, he hoped “she would find another career or find another company.” His son Eric said “strong and powerful women” like his sister don’t “allow” workplace sexual harassment to happen to them. In her 2009 book, The Trump Card, Ivanka Trump said that women complaining of sexual harassment just need to learn how to take a joke. The unifying theme of the first family’s approach to sexual harassment is that women must either quietly shoulder the burden of harassment, or come forward and accept the blame for it.
Exploiting the Weinstein reports in an attempt to mock the Democratic Party is disgraceful in its opportunism, but the problem at hand is deeper, even, than that: Those in positions of power often either abuse women or distrust and silence women who come forward. And whether these influential figures are billionaire presidents or billionaire Hollywood producers is irrelevant because, for women, the outcome is the same. 
And as for Donald Trump Jr. and all those who have joined him in his equal-parts smug and ironic anti-Weinstein Twitter parade, perhaps Death and Taxes managing editor Maggie Serota put it best when she tweeted on Saturday, “If you only care about sexual harassment and women’s safety when it’s the opposing side doing it, maybe you don’t actually care about women.”
Kylie Cheung is a sophomore majoring in journalism and political science. She is also the editorial director of the Daily Trojan. Her column,“You Do Uterus,” runs Thursdays.
What BS. Weinstein was cut from the same mold of Bill Clinton. He was a Democrat through and through. Feminists cut Democrat sexual abusers slack because they align with their agenda. This grants Democratic abusers a latitude not shared by others.
This article, its author, and this newspaper that would give her a column to spread this illogical, hypocritical garbage are nothing short of an embarrassment. This author is going to call Trump Jr. smug, while pounding out this trash? Someone else on here said it best — get this young lady a job at DailyKos and the F away from the university I once thought was above this level of poorly-thought out excrement.
“Following core conservative ideology, women cannot be trusted to make basic bodily decisions; instead, the government must make these decisions for them.”
Funny how, in the progressive worldview, government is the bad guy when it comes to regulating abortions, but the good guy in almost every other regulatory role it plays.
as a fellow trojan… i’m honestly a bit embarrassed.  this is some seriously low grade trolling.  step your game up kylie.
On second thought, this little drooler is doing the world a favor by keeping the concept of “dumb c unt” alive in the 21st century.
A repulsive little slut writing repulsive screeds and drivel.
Typical socialist. Deny responsibility and blame your political opponents.
It’s all part of the Left’s War on Women.
This author and publication are a shining example of how the US university system (and education system) has devolved. No doubt the child who wrote this screed fails to grasp the mysogyny of a weekly column which simply objectifies female reproductive organs.
Huge Democrat donor Harvey Weinstein is the Republicans’ fault. So much stupid.
Democrats are the woman-haters who are blaming everyone but Weinstein.
I’m pretty sure this article was an attempt at satire.  Baaahahahaha…
But the satire was on Kylie and she doesn’t even know it.
Congrats, Kylie, you’ve won the coveted C u nt of the Internet Award for today.
Ok, that’s pretty funny!
She must have thought she was submitting to the other Daily Trojan. You know. That company that makes condoms labeled “Monday,” “Tuesday,” “Wednesday,” …”
A career in the MSM awaits.  If the author doesn’t see the hypocrisy of Hollywood braying about women’s rights for decades and all the while elevating predators like Weinstein to positions of power, journalism is the right profession for her.  She will fit in perfectly.
USC must stand for Unusually Stupid Commies.
Bill Clinton, Ted Kennedy, Harvey Weinstein. All Democrat RAPISTS. Do they teach accurate History at USC?
Let’s not forget Ted was also a murderer.  He swam away from a drowning woman – a woman he drowned.  The evidence suggests that she lived for many hours in the car as it slowly sank and as the oxygen dissipated.  Meanwhile he told nobody.  And at his funeral the Clintons and Obamas called him one of the greatest democrats ever.
I would like to offer up that it is actually possible to discuss Harvey Weinstein without mentioning Donald Trump. No really. Try it.
Do you even read these comments? You’re consistently met with strong counterpoints, and I’m surprised your general narrative doesn’t budge.
If Ms. Cheung wishes to have a career in journalism (other than at Salon), I would recommend that she take down this article and issue an immediate retraction and apology.  This is an absolute career killer.  No one will hire you if they Google your name and this article surfaces.
The way it works in modern American journalism is that the deep-seeded hatred 90% of the press have for those on The Right is supposed to be suppressed and concealed.  This is tantamount to taking your mask off and revealing yourself as a bigot.
“Exploiting the Weinstein reports in an attempt to mock the Democratic Party is disgraceful in its opportunism . . .”
But exploiting “the Weinstein reports” (whatever that Orwellian turn of phrase is meant to imply) in attempt to mock people on the political Right is totally fair game?
This person is the editorial director of The DT??????
So the Daily Trojan is now printing the psychotic ramblings of someone who clearly should be in therapy?  Wonderful.  Maybe next week they can print an article from Ted Kaczynski arguing that Apple has finally now gone too far with the iPhone X.
LOLS mz kylie if you are wondering how you got so much traffic, it’s because no one can believe the level of stupid you have hit.
Just drop out now.  This disugisting man is a huge Democrat donor.  You’re kidding yourself if you think his enablers (and his victims) are Republicans.  We now know where the real war on women is – Liberal Hollywood.
I can’t add anything to the astute observations of other posters here except to say that the breathtaking stupidity displayed by this “Journalism Student” must be obvious to even the most imbecilic reader. Over time I believe perhaps that even some partisan democrat-progressives will see the ridiculousness of the writer’s opinions if they think about it long enough and someone explains it to them.
Thanks to MSM Mania:  Trump only talked about his observation that “when you are rich and powerful, women let you grab their . . .”, Harvey Weinstein practiced the GRABBING FOR HIS WHOLE LIFE, and the women who are FEMINISTS AND themselves famous rich and powerful already KEPT SILENCE when they are savagely treated by this Weinstein creep, and they let the PIG grabbing them and raping them at his will. And they screamed at Trump?  And they kept silent about their rapes, molestations and humiliations.  This picture is very wrong in every way?﻿  And now you have guys like Ben Affleck doing the same thing.  How many other male Hollywood types have gotten away with this behavior?
As a Trojan, I am deeply embarrassed by this mindless twaddle. Delete your account, miss. Then, maybe think about transferring to Berkeley, where this garbage passes as discourse. #ByeFelicia
And take today’s [piece, Kylie, that you wrote trying to backup the need for a Fall break before Thanksgiving.  THat is your Fall break.  And now you poor mistreated children insist on having a 2-3 day day break at the 8-10 week mark in the Fall semester?  Just because some other school sdo it doesn’t make the policy right or needed.  If you and your peers are having such a hard time with school (emotional and mental disorders as you mentioned), then perhaps university level education is not for you.  The university bubble is so much easier on day to day basis than real life, working a job, managing your career, being the best you can be every day……  And most companies don’t have a company holiday after New Years until Memorial Weekend.  Just because there’s a Federal holiday doesn’t require companies to take off on that day.  Geez……  If you are an example of your generation, then you guys are in for a whole world of hurt upon graduation, and American society will be composed of a bunch of emotionally sensitive cry babies.
It’s important to remember allegations against Weinstein have nothing to do with party politics — It’s important to know that Democrat party politics AND BIG DONATIONS have protected this animal from the police for decades.
LOLOLOLOL This is a pretty good parody of the brain-dead sheep populating the left today.  Oh wait–it’s not a parody? SERIOUSLY?
Young lady, if you ever grow up and develop any sort of self-awareness, I hope you can look back on this and laugh with us at your mindless naivete and utter willingness to ignore reality in order to repeat the tired, pathetic liberal tropes that are rapidly destroying your party.  
If you don’t in fact ever grow up, good luck with your regular “diary entries” at dailykos. They won’t laugh at you, but the rest of the world will.
Sadly, there really IS a war on women happening, it’s just that you have wildly misidentified who is propogating it.
So much needs to change across the board is the kindest way to affirm this article.  The absurd attempt to politicize bad behavior when there is no evidence whatsoever that political party (gee, lets just go to JFK, LBJ, and BC as opposed lets say to RR, GHWB, and GWB) has the moral high ground here.   Best I can say for this effort is OMG.   We all want better.  This makes it worse..it divides when it is completely unnecessary and baseless to do so.
The author of this article proves that having a brain is optional to work at the Daily Trojan.
“Exploiting the Weinstein reports in an attempt to mock the Democratic Party is disgraceful in its opportunism…”
Cue Alanis Morissette. 
The sheer demagoguery in this piece is epic. I would echo other comments here about the naivete and/or delusion it takes to follow this line of thinking, but I actually think it has nothing to do with that. 
It’s pure hate from someone whose only interest is throwing rocks, and it does NOTHING to foster real discussion.
If the author aspires to be in media, she will fit right in.
Thanks for helping Trump win a second term.
This takes the cake for sheer stupidity.
You’d do well to turn your focus to the USC sporting teams, Osa Masina is no poster child to promote USC’s safety for young women seeking a degree…and he’s not alone in his overwhelming disrespect towards women.  He’s part of a very entrenched mindset right there at the university, maybe he just misunderstood his victim in your eyes?
Step back little girl, you haven’t been out in the workplace fighting it for decades like so many of us have – it’s just a concept to you and you’re in a bubble.  It has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with a mindset that has to be addressed regardless of who possesses it, not only the powerful and political believe they can act inappropriately and get away with it or blame it on alcohol, drugs, “stress” or any other non-excuse for aggression on another person.
Weinstein was a huge Democrat donor and supporter. 
Always enjoy hearing about Republican’s so-called “War on Women.” You want to experience a type of war? Look at what conservative females are called. Dare you to, but you won’t because like a good little Liberal, you believe they deserve whatever they get.
The article is one-sided and lacks historical framing, but your own partisanship and refusal to accept republican misogyny is just as obvious.
You Democrats are the misogynists who pay women less, defend honor killings and female genital mutilation, and blame everyone but Harvey Weinstein’s action.
I’m not a democrat and you’re repeating false information. I have large problems with the middle east’s misogyny. I also have problems with the vast majority of Americans who refuse to blame U.S. involvement for middle eastern attitudes towards America. It’s ignorant and imperialist. Screw weinstein
Nowhere did he refuse to accept any Republican misogyny, whatever that is. As if it’s a campaign platform. The fact of the matter is that when it comes to tangible acts, Democrats have a more virulent history of sexism and misogyny once you get past their platitudes.
The problem here is that folks like yourself love repeating phrases like “republican misogyny” and asserting that it’s “obvious”, but never quite manage to point to any evidence.
The problem with kids these days and their older peers up to the mid to high 40 year olds is that they have been educated by leftist owned and operated US Dept of Education, run by liberals.  Liberals own the narrative right now via Hollywood, the alt-left media and the secondary and post-secondary education markets, so you can’t blame these kids for their thought processes. They know not what they are doing, as quoted by a young philosopher 2000 years ago.  :-)  Someday they will grow up to be conservatives, as most of us have.
I for one am glad Hollywood lectures middle-America about morals.
It’s little wonder the democratic party lost 1,000 seats during Obama’s tenure.
Now that’s what I call “Hope & Change!”
And it’s people like Kylie that will ensure this republican tsunami grows in strength.  People are tired of the Leftist education system where feelings Trump facts.  Time to change the education system from a snowflake manufacturer into an education system.  Now that would be something new.
Trump just put a woman in charge of Homeland Security. A talented woman. A woman with VAST expertise in not only the job, but also with the agency itself. She did not have to whine about “glass ceilings” or “toxic masculinity”. All she had to do was what all professionals do: Their best.
Try it sometime, child.
Don’t forget about the Female Campaign Manager KellyAnne Conway.
First woman campaign manager to win the US Presidency – HISTORIC!
Kirstjen Nielsen (nominee for DHS) was the 6th female cabinet-level appointment. Democrat progressives seem to like awarding critical positions based upon some irrelevant and artificial formula based on race, gender, sexual identification or whatever the targeted demographic-du-jour is. I prefer selections based on merit regardless of the irrelevant characteristics of the candidate.
Affirmative Action is a leftist Democrat policy that awards employment, education opportunities and other social advancements to a person based on skin color. It is one of the most racist pieces of legislation to come out of Washington DC.  What happened to promotions and academic scholarship awards based on merit?
I nominate Kylie for HRC’s Victim of the Year Award.  Brava!
Dr. Dre makes Weinstein look like a choir boy, with a well-documented history of beating and assaulting women. He and the “artists” on his label have rapped about women in the most-vile terms, yet USC congratulates itself for refusing a gift from Weinstein! Where is the outrage? The irony would be funny were it not so sick!
Intellectually lazy tripe.  Equating what someone says (Trump) with someone’s serial actions against women (Weinstein) over decades is a non-starter.  You are a hater of Trump and Republicans, and will try to pin blame for any and all events on them.  No matter how tortured, you’ll find a way. You crammed your grievance list into this article which made it narrow and shallow: abortion, white male privilege, rape, oppression, workplace harassment, war on women, free birth control, yadda, yadda.  Everything you wrote was predictable, banal and devoid of statistical backing.
So now the DT censors commentary?  What do you think you are?  Twitter?  You have removed my supporting comment to OcamsBlunt’s comment.  Why have you censored an opposing viewpoint?
What a disgusting article and diversion from the facts. My guess is this student has never had to work in workplace environments. The idea this started with Trump or with any political party is a despicable diversion. Are we forgetting about Bill Clinton?  He did not have one two assault or harassment accusers but several, in addition to his assault issues he went after a 19 year old subordinate and lied about it under oath.
I’m 40 now but went through 20 years of it. I worked Silicon Valley where 90% of the corporate leadership is Democrat and where deep sexism, and toleration of harassment was utterly typical.
What is the author trying to say, one political side, Republicans leadership and big wigs, have a problem (and they do); but abject hypocrisy on the Democrat side is irrelevant?
This issue with Weinstein is about the industry sector that has by far the largest problem with it, both in perpetration and widespread tolerance. If you have been a working professional woman with long term friends you now it. I have friends who work in every sector and it is the entertainment industry that is absolutely the worst cesspool of occurrence,  tolerance and hypocrisy on this.

USC Vice President of Advancement and Health Sciences Development David Carrera is no longer employed by the University as of last week, USC officials confirmed Wednesday.
Gretchen Means, executive director of the Office of Equity and Diversity, said in a statement to the Daily Trojan that her office opened an investigation into Carrera after receiving complaints, during which he was put on administrative leave.
The Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday that Carrera was being investigated for sexual harassment allegations. USC officials did not confirm the report.
“We do not tolerate behavior that violates our strict policy and take appropriate disciplinary action when it does,” Means said in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
The Times reported that USC received five complaints about Carrera’s behavior, and that the investigation into Carrera was launched in August, following the Times’ July report on the illicit lifestyle of former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito. 
USC appointed Carrera to the senior position in August 2014. He oversaw the development of Keck Medicine of USC affiliate hospitals and the advancement of academic programs and research centers for the Keck School of Medicine. 
USC did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether Carrera resigned from his position or if he was fired.
Means said that the investigation regarding Carrera is still ongoing.
Rohit Varma, Puliafito’s successor, also resigned from his deanship last week. Varma’s resignation occurred on the same day The Times revealed he was disciplined after a sexual harassment allegation surfaced in 2003.
“Discrimination and harassment have no place at USC,” Means said in the statement. “The investigation is still ongoing and will continue until we fully complete our findings.”
EDITOR’S NOTE: This post has been updated for clarity.
The seminal question all USC alumni are now asking:  why is Max Nikias still employed by USC?
Amen !!!!

It was an ordinary Monday afternoon for Cindy Shiu: Her finance class was canceled, and she was ready to start on homework on the fourth floor of Fertitta Hall. Leaving the restroom, she opened the door to a group of policemen in bulletproof vests, holding guns pointed in all directions.
“A shot of adrenaline I’ve never felt before rushed through my body,” Shiu said. “I bolted down those four flights of stairs.”
Less than one day after the Las Vegas massacre, an adjunct professor in the Marshall School of Business started her 12 p.m. class. Students in the class say she was visibly distraught and was talking about friends who were the city when the shooting took place, leaving 58 dead and 489 injured. Five minutes into class, she falsely claimed there was an active shooter on campus and left the classroom.
Minutes later, public safety officers and police arrived on the scene, ordering students to evacuate. Hundreds of students fled Fertitta Hall, seeking shelter in nearby buildings. Shiu, a junior majoring in business administration, was one of them.
In the aftermath of any episode of mass violence, terrorist attack or natural disaster, individuals touched directly or indirectly are at a higher risk of displaying traumatic stress reactions, according to the National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. According to the center, traumatic stress reactions manifest in four main categories: emotional, cognitive, physical and interpersonal effects.
“Most of these issues occur across a developmental spectrum, they just present themselves differently,” said David Schonfeld, a professor of practice, social work and pediatrics at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work.
Some symptoms include shock, terror, irritability, blame, anger, guilt, grief, emotional numbing, sleep disorders and helplessness, he said. Individuals may display one, many or none of these symptoms.
“Sometimes you don’t see the signs,” Schonfeld said. “Sometimes it’s just based [on] experience and exposure, especially if you’re talking about internal states. The person feels it though.”
From a student perspective, Shiu believes the University could have responded to the false reports more quickly with available USC mental health resources and given students extra time to process the stressful situation last Monday.
“I felt like they should have clearly emphasized mental health services for students and have every professor mention [the false report] briefly,” Shiu said. “I know students who carried on with their midterms at 2 p.m., and that’s not OK.”
Provost Michael Quick issued a statement around 4 p.m. the Monday of the incident, three hours after the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed there was no active shooter. Immediately after the lockdown was lifted, classes resumed as scheduled, unless a professor decided otherwise.
A specialist in pediatric bereavement and crisis and the director for the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement, Schonfeld and his team work with schools across the country to educate and support those experiencing trauma. In educational institutions, a common symptom following a traumatic event is lack of focus and unproductiveness among students, faculty and staff.
“Kids have trouble learning in school, teachers have trouble concentrating and teaching,” Schonfeld said. “This leads to deterioration in academic and work performance.”
Damon Clark, a trauma surgeon at Keck Hospital of USC, noted that the healing process for trauma patients is long. It also requires a multidisciplinary team of professionals working together to mentally and physically heal those affected.
“There’s pain associated to whatever extent their injuries are plus surgical procedures required to treat that injury,” Clark said. “When we have a typical trauma patient from a violent act, we get social work, counselors fairly involved because a lot of them deal with the pain, anxiety, depression.”
Clark believes that the mental aspect is often overlooked in the public.
“In terms of some of the research we do in interpersonal violence, it takes time and a lot of effort to heal from wounds,” Clark said. “But I think one of the major aspects that people forget is the emotional state that people go through. People don’t forget going through that kind of event.”
After evaluations, Clark and his team work with social workers and police to identify next of kin and support those close to the victims. He also continues to brief relatives and close friends of the patient’s status.
“The key thing when you’re dealing with this is to have conversations about the patient’s physical and emotional health as often as possible,” Clark said. “You need to be honest about how they’re doing and describe as much of the process as you can.”
To support fellow Trojans experiencing distress after a major event, Schonfeld recommends friends and classmates to reach out and cheer them up. Though people may feel worried of upsetting someone further, he believes it helps the individual be more open.
“They can withdraw and feel alienated,” Schonfeld said. “The problem is a lot of the time people don’t know what to say and they figure, ‘If I ask about it, it’s going to upset them.’ You’re not upsetting them, you’re just inviting them to share their feelings, so that hopefully you can support them.”
Doctors, social workers and other medical professionals in the USC community are also available.
“We don’t think you can live your life worrying about an incident that may or may not happen, but if there is, we’re here for the community,” Clark said. “We’ll support you physically, emotionally and psychologically — whatever is needed.”

Students may get a two-day break on the eighth week of the fall semester as soon as the 2020-21 academic year.
According to Undergraduate Student Government President Austin Dunn, the break is intended to ease the burden placed on students during the fall semester. The proposal, Dunn said, has cleared all relevant legislative bodies and is awaiting implementation.
“[The proposal] has now passed through USG Senate, Graduate Student Government Senate, Academic Senate and Faculty Senate,” Dunn said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Following the approval by these bodies, the question now is not if the break will be implemented, but when, Dunn said. He added that President C. L. Max Nikias’ supports this effort to lessen the mental burden which USC’s academic calendar may contribute to.
“The next step is to have the break added to the USC calendar, which is governed by a committee that establishes the academic calendar three years in advance,” Dunn said.
Similar proposals have circulated for the past five years, but prior versions were not considered by the Academic Senate. But starting in the 2016-17 school year, the USG administration collaborated with the Engemann Student Health Center to compile data measuring stress levels of students throughout fall semester. The data demonstrated a substantial spike in demand for counseling from weeks 8 through 10, Dunn said.
As the Daily Trojan previously reported, the Faculty Senate previously hesitated to pass the proposal because it believed that students would take advantage of the break rather than focus on their mental health.
“The problem we face as USC students is that during the stretch from Labor Day to Thanksgiving break, USC students have 56 instructional days without any break,” Dunn said.
USC has the longest academic semester, with the most instructional days, of all top-25 schools in the United States. Other top-25 schools, such as UC Berkeley, Georgetown University and Rice University, each have at least three fewer days of instruction during their fall semesters.
“Without a consolidated midterm schedule and the absence of a break, students soon begin to feel overwhelmed,” Dunn said.

USC will not accept Harvey Weinstein’s $5 million pledge to the School of Cinematic Arts, according to a statement issued by the University on Tuesday.
“In light of the admitted behavior by Mr. Weinstein and the subsequent reports there is no way the school would move forward,” SCA spokeswoman Kristin Borella told NBC4 on Tuesday. “This was a pledge and no funding had begun.”
Last Thursday, The New York Times published a report revealing decades of sexual harassment allegations against the film executive, detailing various monetary negotiations with his alleged  victims.
Weinstein was consequently fired from The Weinstein Company on Sunday, after board members cited his violations of the company’s code of conduct, The Times reported.
Following the report, Weinstein published a public statement expressing regret for his actions and announced a $5 million pledge for a foundation to support female filmmakers at SCA. USC later confirmed that the University had been in talks with Weinstein about his foundation for a year.
The University did not immediately decline Weinstein’s pledge following the statements.
Weinstein also previously had ties with USC. In February 2015, Weinstein visited the School of Cinematic Arts as a speaker to discuss his career in the film industry.
“Following the report, Weinstein published a public statement expressing regret for his actions and announced a $5 million pledge for a foundation to support female filmmakers at SCA.”
Please take the money.  Just don’t name a building after him.
Just take the dough, but with no strings attached.  USC, like so many upper tier schools, is all about money, stature and influence.

The football team returned to practice on Tuesday following its win over Oregon State. The Trojans began preparations for a Pac-12 South showdown with Utah while settling some controversy from this weekend.
Darnold apologizes to coaches 
Following Saturday’s win over Oregon State, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold appeared to criticize the team’s offensive play-calling.
“I can sense that defenses are focusing on tendencies of ours,” Darnold said. “So we just have to run different plays out of different formations, motion some more guys [and] get away from our tendencies a little bit, and I think we’ll be fine.”
After Tuesday’s practice, he walked back on those words.
“I looked at the film — honestly, I was just wrong,” Darnold said. “I kind of let my emotions get the best of me in that moment.”
The team’s only offensive captain apparently spoke to the coaching staff about his statements.
“I apologized just because as a player, I know how hard they work, and I know how hard we work as a unit, as an offense to get ready for every single game,” Darnold said. “And for me to make that comment, it’s something I shouldn’t do.”
Quarterbacks coach and pass game coordinator Tyson Helton offered his support for Darnold after hearing about the comments.
“We all know Sam is the most upstanding guy, the most team-oriented guy,” Helton said. “I just know that the great thing about this football team is that we’re all pulling in the same direction.”
Preparing for stout defense
This weekend, the Trojans will clash with Utah, which possesses the second-best defense in the Pac-12 in terms of point allowed per game (18.4). With the possible exception of Notre Dame, this could be the most challenging defensive front USC encounters over the final half of the season.
“Every man [on the defensive line] is over 300 pounds — some of them are 320, 330,” head coach Clay Helton said. “By far the biggest front that we’ll face and, as a tandem, the best two linebackers [Sunia Tauteoli and Kavika Laufatasaga].”
Utah’s defense is also tied for forcing the most interceptions in the conference with nine (USC and Stanford also each have nine). Meanwhile, Darnold has thrown the most interceptions in the Pac-12 (nine).
Injury Report 
On Tuesday, freshman nose tackle Marlon Tuipulotu underwent back surgery, effectively ending his debut season. However, Helton noted that because Tuipulotu played four or fewer games, he can be granted a medical redshirt.
In more positive news, redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe returned to practice this week.
“He looked good,” Helton said. “We’ll see his soreness coming back tomorrow. We’re really working to get him back in football shape.”

The No. 6 women’s soccer team (10-1-1) returns to Los Angeles fresh off a pair of victories against Arizona State and Arizona last week, and the Women of Troy look to continue their excellent start to Pac-12 play Friday night against Colorado.
Colorado (7-4-3) last played Sunday afternoon at home against No. 2 Stanford, losing 3-0.  The Cardinal steamrolled the Buffaloes, outshooting the hosts 26-4 and putting eight shots on target to the Buffaloes’ one.  Stanford controlled the game from the start, with the Buffaloes’ first shot coming in the 26th minute and the second just before halftime, in the 42nd minute.  Colorado could not find an answer for Stanford, which currently sits atop the Pac-12 standings with five wins in five games (USC is currently tied for second with UCLA on 13 points).
The Buffaloes are in a slump right now, riding a two-game losing streak and owning a 0-3 record against ranked Pac-12 opposition this season.  In this spell of bad form, Colorado has conceded 6 goals without cracking the scoresheet once.  Though the Buffaloes have scored 21 goals in 14 games this season, 12 of those scores came in the preseason against Denver and UC Riverside, respectively — both teams are currently unranked and under .500.
Freshman forward Marty Puketapu and sophomore midfielder Taylor Kornieck lead Colorado in scoring with 5 goals each.  Senior midfielder Becca Rasmussen has been a creative threat, contributing five assists this season.  The Trojan defense will look to have all three marked and accounted for at all times during the match in order to cut off the Buffaloes’ main offensive weapons.
The Colorado defense will present more of an issue for USC: The Buffaloes’ backline has conceded just 10 goals in 14 games this season with senior Joss Orejel, who has started all 13 games this season, leading the way. Fortunately for the Women of Troy, they are not struggling for goals at the moment, with four players all on 4 goals this season, including freshman midfielder Savannah DeMelo. The Trojan defense has also proved just as stout as Colorado’s so far this fall, allowing 8 goals in 12 matches. With its front and back lines in sync and sporting an undefeated record at home, USC will look to extend its win streak to five against Colorado.  But the team’s number of come-from-behind wins has been a troubling theme this season: Five of the Women of Troy’s last seven wins have come after they conceded the first goal. Against teams with a solid defense, like Colorado, falling behind could prove costly, and chasing the game opens up the field and allows more room for an opponent counterattack.
A win on Friday evening would not only boost USC’s home record to a perfect 5-0, but it would also, more importantly, give the team a chance of cracking the top five in the United Soccer Coaches Poll and possibly leapfrog Stanford into first place in the Pac-12. The Women of Troy kick off against the Buffaloes at 4 p.m. at McAlister Field.

First off, please allow me to make my opinions clear.
I think it is perfectly OK for athletes to protest in the form of taking a knee during the national anthem. They are influential figures in society who are taking peaceful actions against what they perceive as injustice — not the flag, the military or the anthem itself. The whole argument that politics and sports should be separate is faulty. Sports, just like any other entertainment aspect of society (like film or music), are tied with the ongoings of the world surrounding them.
For examples, look no further than when Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists cloaked with black gloves during their medal ceremony at the 1968 Olympics. Or when then-President Richard Nixon arbitrarily granted Texas the National Championship in 1969 in an effort to gain votes among southern states, even though Penn State finished an identical 11-0.
Sports simply do not exist in a concealed vacuum designed solely to entertain us, and athletes themselves are not different: Football players are real people (not fictional TV characters) with diverse backgrounds, and they have real opinions that they are allowed to express by using the far-reaching platforms they possess. As sports broadcaster Bob Costas recently pointed out on CNN, the national anthem does not play before performances of theatrical plays or movie screenings. It does, however, play before football players perform their craft. Because of this circumstance, numerous athletes (and now coaches and owners) have chosen to use the moment as an opportunity to spark conversations and maybe, just maybe, incite improvements to our country through the act of kneeling.
Ordinary people like you and I are allowed to protest under the First Amendment. So are athletes. And they are doing so. The time and place may make people feel uneasy or uncomfortable; the act itself may seem disruptive or even unpatriotic (I personally do not see it that way). But that’s how most meaningful movements initially feel. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and the NFL’s recent attempts to put an end to the protests are simply wrong and contrary to the intent of the First Amendment.
Now, I arrive at the central question of this column: Why aren’t college athletes also protesting the national anthem like their professional counterparts?
Traditionally, colleges have been hotbeds for discourse, debate and protests. One of the first major draft-card burning rallies in opposition to the Vietnam War occurred at Cal in 1965. Earlier this year, USA TODAY reported 20,000–50,000 college students from more than 250 colleges showed up as part of the Women’s March in Washington, D.C. alone.
Perhaps it is our youthful ignorance, sense of invincibility or idealism that makes us college students think we can single-handedly change the world. Regardless of whether we are always successful in this goal, we try, and we try often. So are college athletes next in protesting police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem?
The answer is complicated. If NFL players are discouraged from showing individuality on or off the field, college players are downright prevented from doing so. In response to players like Reggie Bush, Tim Tebow and Terrelle Pryor writing messages on their
eye-blacks, the NCAA banned the practice in 2010. Other college athletes like Todd Gurley or Johnny Manziel have been suspended by the NCAA for profiting off of their signatures in the form of autograph deals.
College football has always placed emphasis on institutions rather than singular athletes that are actually keeping programs’ wheels turning. The NCAA and its major football conferences would likely have simultaneous panic attacks if individual players started kneeling during the anthem.
That does not mean it won’t happen. At this time last season, a number of players from both Michigan and Michigan State raised their fists during the national anthem before each team’s game, with respective head coaches Mark Dantonio and Jim Harbaugh commending the acts. Now, with multitudes of NFL players kneeling in response to President Donald Trump’s disparaging comments about the practice, it will be interesting to see if college players follow suit in larger numbers.
Granted, most college football teams — including USC — remain in the locker room during the anthem. Regardless, viewers should expect some forms of protest by college players. One Yahoo Sports writer even urged all coaches to start letting their players onto the field so that they could be fully enabled to express their opinions about the issue. Perhaps even student sections will participate in some way.
Whether or not student-athletes will start protesting is up in the air. Regardless of if it happens, it’s strange to see college students on the back end of a movement rather than the forefront.
