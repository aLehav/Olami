The Trojans took down No. 8 North Carolina in a dominant 3-0 victory on Sunday, setting an aggressive tone on offense from the first whistle.
The team’s first shot came from redshirt junior Alex Anthony within the first minute of the game, and the pace didn’t slow from there. The team’s first goal came in the fifth minute, with senior Kayla Mills sending in a perfect arc on a corner kick for senior Morgan Andrews to bury in the back of the net.
“We wanted to show them that we can fly on offense,” Anthony said. “Coming in, we wanted to prove that we can compete; we can set the pace of the game and really control it, and that’s what we did from the beginning.”
That pace paid off again in the 29th minute, when junior Katie Johnson took a cross off her chest and smashed a shot into the left side of the netting. The Trojans had been controlling possession for most of the game, but the 2-0 lead made it clear that they were in control.
Opportunities for the Tar Heels to counter only came in spurts in the first half, which was mostly spent in the Trojans’ attacking half of the field. The team kept North Carolina on its heels, flattening and spreading the defense to make any type of counterattack difficult to execute.
“We’re an attacking team, and we wanted to come out here and prove that today,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “No matter what team we’re playing, this is the confidence and the energy we want to bring to the field.”
But despite the success of the first half, the real challenge was maintaining that pressure for a full 90 minutes. The second half was much more balanced for both teams, with the Tar Heels spending more time in the USC goal box, and reshirt senior goalie Sammy Jo Prudhomme wrapping up a few more saves.
But the Trojans didn’t back down throughout the half, continuing to pressure and force opportunities in the box. Anthony punctuated that pace by slamming home a shot from several feet outside the goal box in the 65th minute, marking the first time in five years that North Carolina allowed three goals in a game. The frontline continued to attack until the final whistle blew, giving the team one of their biggest victories of the year.
There are few teams in women’s soccer with as dominant and storied of a history as North Carolina. With 22 national championships since the tournament began in 1982, the Tar Heels have produced dozens of Olympic champions over the last four decades, including Mia Hamm and Heather O’Reilly. Year in and year out, the team is expected to provide some of the heaviest competition in the NCAA.
The enormity of the victory and the dominance with which the team played was not lost on Anthony or her players.
“This is a high-caliber team, and anyone who plays them knows that,” Anthony said. “I think what we did today, not only with getting the win, but in how we played, how we attacked. I think that’s really going to do a lot for our confidence and the way we play together as a team moving forward.”
The victory is also the fifth straight shutout for the backline. The defense only defended 10 shots and three corner kicks throughout the game, with Prudhomme only needing to wrap up four saves.
Though it was a dominant win for the team, the match wasn’t without its frustrations. The Trojans missed two penalty kicks, with one blocked and the other waved off when sophomore Leah Pruitt tried to knock in her own rebounded shot. But McAlpine believed that the cohesive style of play that his team maintained for the full game was one of the best performances he has seen this season.
“Today was fantastic,” McAlpine said. “I think the team decided as a whole they weren’t the biggest fans of losing those first two games. We came out here today and played our game. That’s right where we want to be, for this game and for every game this season.”

During his tenure as a spinal surgeon at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Jeffrey Wang performed numerous surgeries, but two stand out — those of Jerome Lew and Ralph Weiss. Today, Wang is the co-director of the USC Spine Center, and in late July, the University of California regents agreed to pay $8.45 million to settle two malpractice lawsuits filed by Lew and Weiss against him.
Jessica Zhou | Daily TrojanDoctor’s orders · Wang began working at the Keck School of Medicine after leaving UCLA in 2013, while litigation was still pending against him.
In the lawsuits, the two patients alleged that Wang failed to disclose his financial ties with Medtronic, a medical device company, before using Medtronic’s products in their surgeries. Lew and Weiss, who received $4.2 and $4.25 million in the settlement, respectively, further alleged that Wang never informed them the surgery involved using Medtronic’s products in “off-label” ways never tested for safety.
Wang’s financial relationship with Medtronic involved consulting work and royalties for Medtronic products, according to the lawsuits. The plaintiffs alleged that not only did Wang receive royalties from the Infuse Bone Graft used on Lew and Weiss, but a sales representative from Medtronic was in the operating room during Lew’s surgery. From 2004 to 2013, Wang received over $275,000 in royalties, consulting fees and speaking fees from Medtronic alone.
In Lew’s case, Wang inserted Infuse, designed for use in the lumbar region of the spine, into Lew’s cervical spine, a use that had never been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. A year prior to Lew’s surgery, the FDA had warned health care practitioners that use of Infuse in the cervical spine could be fatal. The bone overgrowth caused by improper use of Infuse caused Lew permanent nerve damage and chronic pain that has persisted despite several corrective surgeries, according to the lawsuit.
Though doctors are permitted to use products in unauthorized ways at their discretion, it is illegal for medical companies to advertise those “off-label” uses. Documents in Lew’s case showing evidence of Medtronic employees promoting Infuse’s use in the cervical spine led to a separate confidential settlement between Lew and Medtronic.
Weiss had only consented to the operation because Wang promised to perform the surgery personally. However, Wang was not present for the first few hours of the surgery, in violation of UCLA and UC policy, instead entrusting critical portions of the surgery to an assistant who then operated on the wrong area of the spine.
“When he first came to the operating room, it was after receiving a phone call saying, ‘We blew it,’” Weiss said. “I didn’t find out until a year after the surgery that he wasn’t even there, that he had just let them run amok. For one of the two residents, I was the first surgery on the first day of his residency, so I was the lucky — or unlucky — person to have him cut his teeth, so to speak, and he just blew it.”
UCLA Health spokesperson Tami Dennis said in a statement that the UC regents settled the lawsuits in order to continue their commitments to patient care, research, education and community service.
“Developing and maintaining public trust are essential to the outstanding medical care and research that are UCLA Health’s hallmark, and we strive for our physicians and staff to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the highest ethical standards,” Dennis wrote.
Wang had previously been caught up in a 2009 U.S. Senate investigation into corporate payments to doctors, which found that Wang had failed to report nearly $460,000 received from pharmaceutical companies.
In 2013, while the lawsuits were pending, Wang was hired by USC as the co-director of the USC Spine Center. On his online profile for the Keck School of Medicine, he is described as having a “… reputation for consistently providing excellent patient care, outstanding qualifications and experience [that] has earned him immense respect from patients and physicians alike.” Wang and the Keck Department of Orthopaedic Surgery declined to comment on the lawsuit.
“It’s all motivated by greed,” Weiss said. “He’d already had problems with these conflicts that had been undisclosed, and the only thing that makes sense to me is that they kept him at UCLA because he’s big business. I don’t know for sure what entered into SC’s hiring decision, but my guess is they looked the other way because they make money off of him.”
Though the settlement was a positive outcome for the plaintiffs, Weiss expressed frustration that Wang did not accept culpability.
“It’s not uncommon for the hospital to pay as opposed to the physicians,” Weiss said. “I would have thought it would have been more appropriate for him to pay, because some of what we were suing him for were pretty egregious acts.”
During settlement negotiations, Wang’s attorneys had pushed for a confidentiality clause to limit the plaintiffs from speaking about the case, but they refused in hopes that the lawsuit would bring attention to the influence that industry money has on the trust between doctors and patients.
“If you’re a physician, you’re allowed to have a relationship with a drug manufacturer, but you can’t keep it secret from your patients. You have to let them know,” Weiss said. “I think it sends a terrible message [for USC] to look the other way, no matter how much business the guy brings in. You’re supposed to protect the patients. You’re supposed to follow the rules.”

Jennifer Massey was supposed to be at the World Trade Center subway stop at 8:45 a.m. on September 11, 2001. She overslept. The first tower was hit that day at 8:46 a.m., and according to Massey, who graduated from USC with a Bachelor’s in History in 2015, it was a moment she would always remember.
Photo courtesy of the Sol Price School of Public PolicyMaintaining the memory · The USC Reserve Officers’ Training Corps open Friday’s 9/11 memorial ceremony, which also included speeches by Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas, Sol Price School of Public Policy Dean Jack Knott and Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni.
“Life as we knew it was transformed forever,” Massey said.
She recounted the span of events that fateful morning, from watching the towers crumble in front of her to the panic she felt while calling her loved ones to tell them she was safe.
In order to ensure that those who lost their lives in the attacks are not forgotten, Massey wanted to bring a monument to USC. With the help of Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni, Massey was able to obtain a piece of steel from the Twin Towers to place on the USC campus, and last Friday morning, members of the USC community gathered to lay a wreath at USC’s 9/11 Memorial to commemorate the 15-year anniversary of the tragic event.
Located outside the USC Department of Public Safety offices, the piece of steel now stands as one of the few monuments in Los Angeles that memorializes 9/11. At Friday’s event, DPS Chief John Thomas talked about the number of first responders who lost their lives while trying to save others.
“We should let this act as a reminder of the sacrifices that were made that day and of our duty to this community to live up to those very same ideals,” he said.
2,966 lives were lost on September 1, 2001, including over 400 first responders. Soni, meanwhile, addressed the emotions that come with the memory of 9/11.
“I believe I speak for all of us here when I say that we will all carry those powerful images and overwhelming emotions with us throughout our lives,” Soni said. “Indeed, we will never forget.”
Soni also acknowledged the fact that acts of terrorism still occur often in many parts of the world, and because the USC community is made up of people from all different backgrounds, “we mourn together as a global Trojan family.”
Dean of the Sol Price School of Public Policy Jack Knott said that in 2016 alone, there have been an estimated 1,213 terrorist attacks, and over 10,000 people have been killed. Knott discussed the changes that have arisen in this country as a result of 9/11, as well as the work that USC is doing to increase terrorism prevention. The Safe Communities Institute at Price is conducting research that evaluates the effectiveness of the current counterterrorism measures.
“We must ensure that in the midst of trying to prevent terrorism, we preserve our values and way of life,” Knott said. “We must hold on to the sense of being one community. We must not let terrorism defeat us nor alter our commitment to the values we hold dear.”
Thomas echoed Knott’s message and emphasized the importance of staying united even as terrorist attacks are on the rise.
“In this time in our nation’s history, virtues of patriotism and unity that were displayed in the aftermath of 9/11 remind us that we have so much more in common as Americans that binds us together than the things that divide us,” Thomas said.
Massey said she wants those who lost their lives to be remembered, and she wants to make sure 9/11 is not just simply a forgotten part of history.
“Remembering that day is not a choice but our solemn obligation,” Massey said. “Generations of USC students will have the privilege of having this [monument] on campus for hundreds of years.”

After winning its first two games of the season, the No. 2 men’s water polo team defeated UC Santa Barbara on Saturday 14-3 in its first home game of the 2016 season and then beat both Whittier and LaVerne in the Inland Empire Classic on Sunday in LaVerne.
Coming into the match against the No. 6 Gauchos, the Trojans averaged just 3 goals allowed per game with goalkeepers junior McQuin Baron and redshirt freshman Simon Wu sporting 16 total saves.
Against the Gauchos, the Men of Troy were efficient on both sides of the ball. On offense, USC had two players with hat tricks as junior two-meter Lachlan Edwards and leading scorer junior drive Matteo Morelli scored three goals apiece.
The Trojans then traveled to the Inland Empire Classic at the University of La Verne to take on Whittier College Poets and the host La Verne Leopards.
USC made quick work of both opponents, beating Whittier 27-3 and LaVerne 26-1.
Next up for the Trojans is a match against Stanford on the road Saturday.

The Trojan football team picked up a much-needed victory Saturday, with a workmanlike win over the Utah State Aggies. Although expected, it was encouraging to see the Trojans bounce back from the dejecting experience that took place in Arlington, Texas last week. It is infinitely better to enter next week’s matchup against Stanford with some momentum at 1-1, instead of a dismal 0-2.
With that being said, the 2016 version of the Trojan football team still has many unanswered questions. There are undoubtedly some positives as both the defense and special teams are markedly improved from a year ago.
Save for a single blown coverage in the first half against Alabama last week, defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s squad has been excellent for three out of four halves — not to mention the fact that scheme was not the culprit for the second half breakdown last week.
On the special teams’ front, John Baxter again is demonstrating why he is one of the better coordinators in the country. The unit accounted for a touchdown and set up another easy score to start off the game. In closer games later this year, a two touchdown swing from special teams could be the difference between a win and a loss. While the missed field goal this week and the botched punt last week were unforced errors, some growing pains are expected with a new punter and kicker.
Additionally, redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold demonstrated why the competition was so close this summer. The velocity and placement he put on his touchdown pass to junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster is reminiscent of Mark Sanchez darts to Patrick Turner and Damian Williams.
Since Sanchez, USC quarterbacks haven’t had the zip and arm strength to make those NFL caliber throws across the middle of the field. The fact that Darnold is doing that in his first meaningful minutes bodes well for his future as well as that of the USC program. When he takes the helm as the starter down the road, the future is bright.
For now though, USC has some significant concerns on offense. The offensive line that was supposed to be a cornerstone of the offense looked like a sieve for parts of the game against Utah State. The first drive looked like a continuation of last week, with the offensive line practically inviting the Aggies linemen in to greet redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne.
Granted, starting center junior Toa Loehbendahn is out for the year and redshirt senior Chad Wheeler isn’t 100 percent, but if Utah State was able to sustain a push up front, what will Stanford and Utah do the next two weeks? It doesn’t matter how great the skill position players are if Browne can’t consistently have time in the pocket.
Granted, the line did improve as the game went on, but it still didn’t feel that the Trojans’ offense was as fluid or dynamic as it can be. There were no big plays down the field, no breakout runs from running backs senior Justin Davis, sophomore Ronald Jones or sophomore Aca’Cedric Ware and very little creativity across the middle of the field. While Davis had an exciting grab on a middle screen, the rest of the plays were pedestrian at best.
It’s quite possible the offensive play calling staff was saving its best work for Stanford next week, but the Trojans will really have to improve if they want to beat the Cardinal. The Trojans aren’t utilizing a fullback or power line looks. Without either, it is inordinately difficult to put together consistent 10-plus play drives for 70-plus yards and five-plus minutes. It requires too much discipline and perfection from a young squad, as one penalty or missed block ends a drive prematurely.
Part of the offensive look the Trojans are going with requires speed and the execution of big plays. Without that spark, the team just isn’t anywhere near its potential with the outstanding athletes it has on offense.
Hopefully, the Trojans were holding back against the Aggies and unleash a torrent of offensive fire power next week against David Shaw and the Cardinal. Or they beat Stanford at its own game and surprise them with a power look up front.
Either way, next week is a major opportunity for head coach Clay Helton’s first statement victory. The Trojans will need to carry the defensive and special teams’ execution into next week, with Pendergast figuring out an answer to Christian McCaffrey in a way Justin Wilcox never could. Even more than that though, the team needs the offense that it envisioned in the Spring, with Browne connecting on deep balls and Jones and Davis slicing up opposing defenses for 20-plus yard carries. That combination would yield a much needed victory against Stanford.

The Trojans took down No. 8 North Carolina in a dominant 3-0 victory on Sunday, setting an aggressive tone on offense from the first whistle.
Emily Smith | Daily TrojanBreaking through · Senior midfielder Morgan Andrews scored a goal to help USC defeat powerhouse North Carolina for the first time in history.
The team’s first shot came from redshirt junior Alex Anthony within the first minute of the game, and the pace didn’t slow from there. The team’s first goal came in the fifth minute, with senior Kayla Mills sending in a perfect arc on a corner kick for senior Morgan Andrews to bury in the back of the net.
“We wanted to show them that we can fly on offense,” Anthony said. “Coming in, we wanted to prove that we can compete; we can set the pace of the game and really control it, and that’s what we did from the beginning.”
That pace paid off again in the 29th minute, when junior Katie Johnson took a cross off her chest and smashed a shot into the left side of the netting. The Trojans had been controlling possession for most of the game, but the 2-0 lead made it clear that they were in control.
Opportunities for the Tar Heels to counter only came in spurts in the first half, which was mostly spent in the Trojans’ attacking half of the field. The team kept North Carolina on its heels, flattening and spreading the defense to make any type of counterattack difficult to execute.
“We’re an attacking team, and we wanted to come out here and prove that today,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “No matter what team we’re playing, this is the confidence and the energy we want to bring to the field.”
But despite the success of the first half, the real challenge was maintaining that pressure for a full 90 minutes. The second half was much more balanced for both teams, with the Tar Heels spending more time in the USC goal box, and reshirt senior goalie Sammy Jo Prudhomme wrapping up a few more saves.
But the Trojans didn’t back down throughout the half, continuing to pressure and force opportunities in the box. Anthony punctuated that pace by slamming home a shot from several feet outside the goal box in the 65th minute, marking the first time in five years that North Carolina allowed three goals in a game. The frontline continued to attack until the final whistle blew, giving the team one of their biggest victories of the year.
There are few teams in women’s soccer with as dominant and storied of a history as North Carolina. With 22 national championships since the tournament began in 1982, the Tar Heels have produced dozens of Olympic champions over the last four decades, including Mia Hamm and Heather O’Reilly. Year in and year out, the team is expected to provide some of the heaviest competition in the NCAA.
The enormity of the victory and the dominance with which the team played was not lost on Anthony or her players.
“This is a high-caliber team, and anyone who plays them knows that,” Anthony said. “I think what we did today, not only with getting the win, but in how we played, how we attacked. I think that’s really going to do a lot for our confidence and the way we play together as a team moving forward.”
The victory is also the fifth straight shutout for the backline. The defense only defended 10 shots and three corner kicks throughout the game, with Prudhomme only needing to wrap up four saves.
Though it was a dominant win for the team, the match wasn’t without its frustrations. The Trojans missed two penalty kicks, with one blocked and the other waved off when sophomore Leah Pruitt tried to knock in her own rebounded shot. But McAlpine believed that the cohesive style of play that his team maintained for the full game was one of the best performances he has seen this season.
“Today was fantastic,” McAlpine said. “I think the team decided as a whole they weren’t the biggest fans of losing those first two games. We came out here today and played our game. That’s right where we want to be, for this game and for every game this season.”

I remember, very clearly, the first time I heard about the term “whitewashing,” the act of giving white actors preference in casting, especially in roles where the character is not white.  I almost didn’t want to believe it was real. From seventh grade to high school, Breakfast at Tiffany’s was one of my favorite films. I, like many young teenagers, romanticized the Audrey Hepburn movie’s elegance, fashion and overall splendor. However, when I watched the movie with my friend who is passionate about social justice, she pointed out to me that Mr. Yunioshi, played by Mickey Rooney, was a very offensive portrayal of yellowface. As we continued to watch the movie, I didn’t know how to feel. I wanted to say, “But, other than THAT part, the rest of the movie is great!” However, I knew that there wasn’t any way that I could possibly justify something that is so offensive to the Asian-American community.
After that enlightening instance, I started to pay more attention to casting in movies. I started following the tag on Tumblr, where many angry bloggers vented their frustrations. I began to understand them. Recently, Matt Damon was given the lead of the movie The Great Wall.  The movie is a historical fiction story about the protection of Europe and its “growing system of walls, where the characters fight monsters to protect it. Those who think that the movie is actually about the Great Wall of China will be mistaken. The film also takes place during the Song dynasty, a very dynamic time in Chinese history. However, I didn’t know there were white males in China during the Song Dynasty. There are billions of Asians in this world, yet they choose a white person to play an Asian character. To make things worse, Damon also publicly announced that diversity is more important in front of the camera than behind the camera on an episode of HBO’s Project Greenlight. He also said the show should focus on diversity primarily “in the casting of the film, not in the casting of the show.” Despite the fact that Damon apologized for the statement, it still doesn’t discount the fact that he’s a white man starring in film with a major Chinese landmark as the center of the narrative.
In addition, Scarlett Johansson was recently rumored to have been casted as the lead in the new live-action Mulan movie after she was already under fire for playing a Japanese character in the film Ghost in the Shell. While I am a fan of Johansson, I was definitely not a fan of this decision. In other instances of whitewashing, such as when Angelina Jolie was cast as Cleopatra, there wasn’t much backlash. However, when actress Zendaya Coleman was cast as comic book character Mary Jane in the Spider-Man Homecoming, the casting decision received a lot of flack. While it’s not a secret that minorities are underrepresented in the media, the public is still choosing to be frustrated by the wrong things.
Growing up, the only Asian characters I saw on my TV screen were Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Otherwise, the Asian characters I saw in movies and TV were never the leading roles, only nerds and supporting character. So how is it fair that when there are movies about Asian culture, Hollywood still doesn’t cast Asians? While there has been some progress, with actresses like Mindy Kaling and Constance Wu starring in their own shows, it’s still not enough. Asian Americans should be able to comfortably feel that they are represented in the media and not have their stories, histories and characters whitewashed by Hollywood.
The solution is actually very simple — if the film is about black people, use black actors. If the film is about Native Americans, use Native American actors. If the movie is about Chinese or Taiwanese people, use Chinese or Taiwanese actors. If the show is about Egyptians, please use Egyptian actors. It’s really not hard. If the film has a storyline about characters who are different races, there’s no point if we don’t use the correct race. Our world is diverse, with cultures that are diverse, and our movies should absolutely reflect that.

A musical journey reflecting the ideas expressed in the concert’s title “Fate and Freedom” was the focus of the Sept. 9 evening’s concert in Bovard Auditorium. Hosted by the USC Thornton School of Music and Visions and Voices, the evening showcased Giuseppe Verdi’s overture, La forza destina, Gustav Mahler’s Ich bin der welt abhanden gekommen culminated in Pyotr Liych Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 4.
Photo courtesy of USC Thornton School of MusicTake a bow · The USC Thornton Symphony Orchestra performed a powerful rendition of composer Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 4.
Led by music director Carl St. Clair, the symphony seemed to not simply perform the pieces of the evening, but embody them. It has been St. Clair’s lifetime work and emphasis to not only perform works, but to understand the context and the life history of the composers who wrote them.
With Verdi’s La forza del destino, the orchestra reacts seamlessly with St. Clair’s conducting style perfecting the excitement and changing moods throughout passages of the piece. Synergistic performances in the string section balanced with equal depth of understanding from the wind instruments allow the orchestra to mix between musical turmoil and the simplest of solo passages with emotional ease. The orchestra performed on another level, not often expected from student musicians, yet perfected by St. Clair. St Clair commented on Verdi’s relationship with fate.
“If you look at the last acts of Otello, Don Carlos, Rigoletto, especially Aida, you feel that Verde himself is already beginning to work through music, the acceptance of fate,” St. Clair said.
The performance of Gustav Mahler’s Ich bin der welt abhanden gekommen provided a perfect example of student musicianship. Performed in collaboration with guest Mezzo-soprano Kristen Rothfuss Erbst echoing the lyrical sentiment of isolation and fate, further emphasizing the evening’s theme described by St. Clair as “a certain ambivalence, a certain afraid-ness and certainty, but at the end resignation, expectance.” A gradual drawn-out symphonic passage builds up sprinkled with vocal solos by Erbst. The difficult passages in the piece were perfectly executed, a pure display of musicianship by the performers.
The turbulent period in Tchaikovsky’s life led to the composition of Symphony No. 4. The final piece of the evening was precluded by a hybridized performance of sections of Symphony No. 4 accompanied by dramatic performance featuring passages from Tchaikovsky’s letters to his friend Madame Von Meck with actor David Prather as Tchaikovsky and actress Lily Knight as Meich. The monologues contributed a unique multimedia performance that brought life, context and meaning to Tchaikovsky’s piece. The performance not only emphasized the composition itself but also the equally important story behind the composition, making a beneficial impact and creating aneducational opportunity.
“The piece represents a musical acceptance of fate and the ultimate freedom his music allows us.” St. Clair said.
A precise mosaic of passages and ideas exuded drama and fate. All of the sections were balanced and played well off each other. An oboe solo in the second movement met with the strings, displaying the personal conflict of Tchaikovsky. The musicians brought their performance to dramatic extremes providing a triumphant cap to an already well-executed performance. With a standing ovation, St. Clair held up the physical score in front of the audience as if directing the attention to the real star of the evening.
The next Thornton Symphony concert titled “Dance as Music” will take place on Sept. 23 at 7:30 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium. The symphony, conducted by Sharon Lavery, will perform Stravinsky’s Petrushka and Ravel’s Bolero.

Indie pop acts like the British band Bastille lay at a crossroads between disparate genres — indie, like brazenly alternative acts such asModest Mouse who attract cult followings, and pop, as exemplified by more commercially-oriented bands like Maroon 5. With its 2013 debut album Bad Blood, Bastille appeared to be having trouble finding their footing in a schizophrenic genre; their struggle to have both an alternative sound and widespread appeal resulted in an overly conventional, semi-alternative album that did not showcase the band’s full potential. Thankfully, in their latest offering, Wild World, Bastille more fully realizes its artistic vision and has a much more confident and distinct sound.
Photo courtesy of Virgin RecordsBastille Day · Indie pop band Bastille released its second studio album Wild World on Friday. The band has been praised for producing hits such as “Pompeii” and “Flaws” in its 2013 debut album Bad Blood.
Continuing on the groundwork set in Bad Blood, Wild World is resplendent with upbeat electropop and soaring, arena- and radio-friendly choruses. Producer, songwriter and lead vocalist Dan Smith has a knack for writing powerful hooks, and his considerable talent is on display in offerings such as “Good Grief” and “Send Them Off!” These tracks are almost certain radio smashes and conform to the buoyant beats Bastille fans have come to expect, but they are also imbued with just enough experimentation and inspiration to remain fresh and interesting.
However, to prevent falling into a homogenous sound, Wild World also takes a much-needed dive into darker material, such as in the moodier, violin-heavy tracks of “Glory” and “Oil On Water.” Not only do these songs provide the record with a more diverse palette of moods and sounds, but also its slower, slightly more minimalistic production is a breath of fresh air on an otherwise maximalist album. Songs such as “Shame,” “An Act of Kindness” and “Fake It” rely on heavy backbeats and a darker electronic sound, reflecting Smith’s range as a producer. Occasionally, however, it still feels as if Bastille is restrained in its experimentation by its desire to be commercially appealing; “Campus,” for instance, contains an interesting, eerie EDM break but then abruptly transitions back to the expected upbeat Bastille sound, as if Smith wanted to experiment but felt pressured to conform to fan and radio expectations.
Furthermore, a serious weakness that carries over from Bad Blood is the band’s propensity to be overly maximalist; Smith frequently layers so many sounds together that the melody is lost and the track dissolves into confused noise. He most often succumbs to this flaw during his choruses in his effort to make them as powerful as possible, as exemplified in “Blame,” “The Anchor” and “The Currents.” Wild World’s overproduction also makes it hard for the instruments to breathe, and the listener loses the well-conceived guitar riffs of “Power” and “Winter of Our Youth” due to the excess of background instrumentation.
The overproduction of Wild World makes Smith’s singing talents absolutely crucial to making Bastille’s songs work. Instead of adding personality, his vocals are mostly utilized to meet the difficult task of carrying the melody in the fast-paced hubbub of instrumentals. And though his considerable range and polished delivery help him do just that in tracks like “Lethargy,” there is also the sense that his talents are not being used to their full potential. The one exception is in the standout track “Two Evils,” which showcases Smith’s considerable skills by pairing him with the ghostly, eerie strumming of a single acoustic guitar. With the more minimalistic, intimate production, Smith’s voice comes to the forefront and he is able to show off his range and even an intriguing rasp absent from the rest of the album.
The area in which Smith is truly able to shine throughout the album, however, is in his unique and thoughtful songwriting. One of Bastille’s strengths is its lyrical distinctiveness, and Wild World reflects Smith’s nerdy and introspective personality well. Songs like the aforementioned “Send Them Off!” reference Shakespeare and Italian science-fiction movies, revealing little tidbits of Smith’s character as a lover of film and English literature. Smith even gets political in “Four Walls (The Ballad of Perry Smith),” which recounts the 1959 execution of a murderer to discuss Smith’s attitudes on capital punishment (“now we’re faced with two wrongs”). The timeliest track, “Warmth,” also contains the album’s name to describe the current state of global political upheaval that drives Smith to escape through music.
Wild World is a successful album because it allows Bastille’s sound to mature; it is also more open to experimentation, displaying Bastille’s greater confidence in its own musical identity. Though the band still seems somewhat tentative in its exploration of new styles and is prone to overproduction, Bastille is energized, musically gifted and has something interesting and fairly original to say. In Wild World, they managed to craft an album that will cement their place in the public conscience while promising innovative things to come.

While discussing his and his brother Jack’s new novel When Millennials Rule: The Reshaping of America, David Cahn told U.S. News and World Report, “I think the story of this election will be the story of voter turnout among millennials. I think if they turn out and vote for Clinton, she wins. If they don’t, she loses.”

Considering that only 19 percent of millennials turned up to vote in  2012, this presidential election still seems to be up in the air. But it’s about more than just politics; it’s about a generation labeled as “narcissistic and self-centered” but ironically fails to believe in itself and its power.
In her book Generation Me, psychology professor Jean Twenge explains that this generation is “tolerant, confident, open-minded and ambitious but also disengaged, narcissistic, distrustful and anxious.”  But forget the tolerance and open-mindedness, because when people think of Generation Me, selfie sticks, Instagram and Twitter usually come to mind. After all this, you’d think that millennials think rather highly of themselves. But if this were true, then more than 19 percent of millennials would have headed to the ballot box in 2012. If this were true, then over 80 percent of 18- to 29-year olds would have cast ballots back in the 2014 midterm election. If this were true, then more of them would believe that their votes and opinions make a difference.
Only so many of these statistics can be attributed to apathy or just plain politics as usual. It’s more about a fundamental issue of a supposedly self-centered generation that can’t seem to believe in the self. In their (somewhat) short lifespans, millennials have seen war, corruption, income inequality, climate change and racial injustice. And instead of rushing to the ballot boxes to pencil in leaders who they believe can make a difference, millennials feel powerless to stop the tide that seems outside of their control. In the midst of so much suffering, it becomes difficult to think that one vote can stop crime, create jobs or prevent terrorism.
Yet Brexit proves that every vote counts.  Even though about 64 percent of registered 18- to 24- year-old voters headed to the polls, 90 percent of over-65s cast their ballot.  The result, to the dismay of a young generation that overwhelmingly voted to remain in the European Union, was a narrow victory for the “Leave” campaign.
This contradiction has become a growing phenomenon that could have devastating consequences in the future outside of just politics. Take for example the environment —  despite some labeling millennials as the “environmentally friendly” generation, this unfortunately doesn’t always translate into action. According to the Washington Post, Twenge and her colleagues found “when surveyed decades ago, about a third of young baby boomers said it was important to become personally involved in programs to clean up the environment. In comparison, only about a quarter of young Generation X members — and 21 percent of millennials — said the same.” Even worse, “15 percent of millennials said they had made no effort to help the environment, compared with 8 percent of young Generation X members and 5 percent of young baby boomers.” And to top it off: “In the case of heating fuel, 78 percent of young baby boomers and 71 percent of young Generation X members said they cut back, compared with 56 percent of millennials.” For millennials, when they see 7.4 billion other humans consuming resources, it becomes easy to lose sight of the impact of their individual choices.
But everyone knows that change begins with the individual. From Dorothy Day to Nelson Mandela, history provides humanity with a laundry list of individuals who embodied change and progress. Yet millennials don’t all need to awaken consciences or end apartheid to do their part. But they must recognize that as individuals, as they already know, they do matter. And they all have their part to play in bettering their world.
If millennials believe that the world revolves around them, then they should be able to change how the world revolves. With a polarizing election that could set our country on two completely separate paths, climate change rearing its ugly head more and more frequently and an abundance of other problems clamoring for our attention, the world needs millennials more than ever. And luckily, they don’t even need a change of heart to use their self-centeredness to be the change they wish to see. Watch out world; here comes the real Generation Me.

My female friends and I have had an ongoing conversation about the experience of being a woman in the classroom. We tell our stories, compare and inevitably realize how much we share in our respective experiences. Our initial inclination before engaging in these discussions is to question whether our experiences are singular — anomalies reflective of personal idiosyncrasies, rather than a pernicious phenomenon outside our own control. These conversations have helped us all to understand that our shared frustrations are ultimately the product of a classroom culture where gender bias persists.
Look around the classroom, listen to those speaking and you will typically find that the students being called on have something in common — they’re male. A large body of research, including Catherine Krupnick’s Harvard study, indicates that gender bias within the classroom manifests in a myriad of forms. For example, male instructors call on male students more frequently than female students. A Columbia University study found that most professors are more likely to use male students’ names when calling on students, and when attributing ideas carried on in classroom discussions, they ask males more abstract questions deemed more difficult than the factual ones more often posed to females. Male students, of their own volition, speak more often and for longer periods of time during discussions and are more likely to blurt out a response without raising their hands or waiting for the instructor to call on them.
Meanwhile, female students are more likely to be interrupted while speaking (sometimes by other female students), speak less loudly and for a shorter duration of time and often employ a mode of speaking known as “linguistic hedging,” whereby the respondent will use phrases such as “I feel like” or “I guess.” The convergence of these gender inequalities results in an environment in which women feel both alienated and inextricably bound to a system of power that favors men.
If a correlation between power and speaking exists, perhaps you are thinking that this festering issue would eventually go away if women simply raised their hands and spoke more often in the classroom. Beyond the aforementioned barriers to this simple antidote, women subconsciously learn over time that a host of negative consequences exist in response to any initiative to assert themselves. Women who actively assert their voices not only experience interruption more often than men but also become targets of criticism, judged for being “too aggressive” or “too talkative.” This bias continues even past university — according to one Yale University study of male and female U.S. senators, while men are readily rewarded with an affirming nod for speaking, women anticipate backlash for high volubility. Linguistic hedging, the subject of recent debate, is undoubtedly, in part, the result of such backlash. It is an endless feedback loop.
Last May, Molly Worthen, an author and assistant professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, argued in The New York Times that linguistic hedging represents the degradation of rational thought and the ascendance of a kind of relativism that muddles reason and emotion and restricts debate on college campuses. In the article, Antonio Damasio, a professor at USC, affirmed Worthen’s claims, as he referred to the phrase “I feel like” as “a sign of laziness in thinking.” Certainly, there are times when people use “I feel like” when they are not prepared or unwilling to commit to an argument. However, for women, the use of this phrase and other forms of linguistic hedging are acts of professional survival, rather than indicators of “laziness.”
Women are more likely to couch their statements with “I feel like” or turn their statements into a question, because their experiences in the classroom and the workplace have taught them that their success largely depends upon these unconscious survival tactics. These strategies give one a sense of security in an environment where, as research shows, women are punished with greater criticism for asserting themselves, especially if their ideas are perceived to be incorrect.
Linguistic hedging is the direct result of a society where women feel compelled to make their speech more palatable to the gatekeepers of influence: Men. Rationality, defined in this context as cognizance of social consequences, is precisely what compels women to employ supposedly “irrational” modes of speech.
In response, professors should be conscious of gender bias in the classroom and actively take steps to mitigate the barriers that keep women from enjoying the same education as their male peers.

Grouplove’s much awaited third studio album dropped  Friday. The indie pop group has been on a one year  hiatus and hasn’t released an album since September 2013. The album, Big Mess, is said to be a tribute to lead singers Hannah Hooper and Christian Zucconi’s baby girl. 
The album kicks off with the single “Welcome to Your Life,” a song that embodies the classic Grouplove vibe. The lyrics, “We’re back in business” let fans know that Grouplove is back and better than ever. Zucconi and Hooper’s voices blend flawlessly in a harmonic masterpiece that join the ever-present folk guitar and synth, creating that Grouplove sound. 
From the first few songs, it seems this is going to be another familiar indie pop album with little risk. However, by the fourth track, “Enlighten Me,” the listener is clued in to the fact that this band has grown artistically. They begin stripping down their sound and toying around with simplicity. “Enlighten Me” gives the feeling that the track is being made as the audience listens to it, with a new layer being added every couple of bars to give it a wonderful build up. The track “Spinning” mixes poppy synthes with a folk vibe and features a back-and-forth between Zucconi and Hooper, creating a relaxing sensation that procures visions of beach days and soaking up the sun. 
The band has  cited Nirvana as a main source of inspiration, which is very apparent on this album. Heavy 90s guitar reminiscent of Kurt Cobain’s distinct sound drives the song “Traumatized,” which, surprisingly, focuses on parenthood and the epiphanies associated with that chapter in life. Other 90s influences seem to have seeped in as well, as tracks “Good Morning” and “Don’t Stop Making It Happen” have a late 90s early-2000’s pop sound similar to Deee-lite’s “Groove Is In the Heart.” “Cannonball” begins with a drumbeat similar to that of Beyonce and Jack White’s “Don’t Hurt Yourself.” It continues on with an alternative-rock sound which contrasts the band’s normal indie pop vibe. 
These new takes on music demonstrate the growth this group has experienced as a band. A majority of bands that are successful in the long-term change their sound around their third studio album. The band has matured artistically and has morphed into another being. This had allowed the band to break from their pigeonholed “sound” that made them well-known. As with any art-form, music is a reflection of a culture or group of people and it takes the form of issues that are prevalent in the musician’s life.
 Grouplove is no exception to this trend. Zucconi and Hooper’s lives have changed drastically. Bassist Sean Gadd left the band three years ago, and Daniel Gleason has taken his place. The new perspective provided by Gleason no doubt had an impact on the final product that is Big Mess. These changes shape the way their art is created. And while fans still get their feel-good dance track with “Do You Love Someone,” Grouplove has undoubtedly grown into a more mature group better equipped to handle the ever-changing landscape of issues in today’s world.

Hey! It’s me, Allegra! Back with another edition of Tune View for Trojan Tunes. It’s a little bit of a slow month for new releases as people are recovering from summer and prepping for fall, but as always there are still great new records to talk about and a ton of awesome upcoming shows. Let’s get into it!
Oshwa – I We You Me
I can already feel it in the air— Chicago band Oshwa’s sophomore album I We You Me is going to be one of the best and most criminally underlooked records of 2016. Stirring strings, evocative piano lines, and vocalist Alicia Walter’s throaty, rich voice are the secret ingredients to the recipe for delicious and filling contemporary indie rock.
LIYL: Fiona Apple, Kishi Bashi, apple pie fresh out of the oven
Angel Olsen – MY WOMAN
One of the most powerful and intense songwriters of the contemporary era, Angel Olsen has returned with a new album. MY WOMAN fuses her past folk sensibilities with a new and emotional rock sound, bringing her hardships to life in a melodically stunning fashion.
LIYL: Sharon Van Etten, Waxahatchee, staring out the window on a moving train while crying softly
Bastille – Wild World
After 2013’s soaring debut Bad Blood, there was a long wait to see if Bastille’s next album would live up to the unique alt-pop impression created by their cinematic soundscapes. The jury’s still out, but Wild World has finally been released and this 19-song opus takes Dan Smith’s throaty compositions to the next level with added layers of synths and guitars. 
LIYL: The 1975, Passion Pit, David Lynch movies
Anna Ash – Floodlights
Songwriter Anna Ash divides her time between Los Angeles and Michigan, and her airy, indie alt-country sound reflects equally the sunsets over the Silverlake hills and the sunrises over the lakes of the northern MI backcountry. Accompanied by a gorgeously tight rhythm section, Ash’s dreamlike voice is the missing ingredient to your fall playlists.
LIYL: Esme Patterson, Emmylou Harris, perfect September nights on the back porch
The Tuts – Update Your Brain
London trio The Tuts describe themselves as “3-tone punk pop,” referring to their diverse skin tones as a point of pride— other points of pride for them being their hugely DIY aesthetic, going the no-manager route and self-funding their records and tours through PledgeMusic. It’s working out fabulously for them— their debut full-length Update Your Brain is a joyous explosion of catchy feminist guitar-pop jams. 
LIYL: Kate Nash, Tacocat, girls to the front!!!
