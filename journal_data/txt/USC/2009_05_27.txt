 
Quick exit · Vasquez lasted only two innings Sunday vs. Cal. - Amaresh Sundaram Kuppuswamy |Daily Trojan
USC baseball concluded its season with a series win over Cal, taking the first two games but falling short in the third and narrowly escaping a no-hit bid.
Sunday, the Trojans took on Cal lefthander Chris Petrini, who brought into the contest a 3-3 record in 34 innings pitched. The junior pitched the game of his life against USC, holding the Trojans hitless through six and two-third innings before allowing a single to Hector Rabago and, later, a Joe De Pinto double. 
Senior lefthander Anthony Vasquez started the game for the Trojans but ran into trouble in the second inning, eventually giving up a two-RBI triple to score two runners who had reached base via walk.
The Bears piled on four more runs against Vasquez, chasing him mid fifth inning. Redshirt freshman righthander Andrew Triggs shut them down with three and two-thirds innings of one-hit ball, but the damage had been done in a 6-0 final.
Saturday’s game was the exact opposite, as the Trojans hit the Bears with a barrage of runs.
Cal starter Kevin Miller retired USC’s Mike O’Neill to start the game, but then allowed five consecutive singles and a walk and was removed from the game in favor of Brian Diemer. Miller was charged with six runs by the end of the inning in only one-third of an inning pitched.
That was all the offense USC would need, as Trojan junior ace Brad Boxberger was on the mound. Boxberger, in his last start before he will face major league teams as a draftable prospect in the June 9 MLB draft, went six innings and gave up four runs.
USC kept the offense going throughout, putting up another run in the third inning and two-spots in the sixth and eighth innings.
In the seventh, the Trojans carried out an interesting phenomenon. They had one hit — an Alex Sherrod single — yet scored three runs with the help of two wild pitches from Cal reliever Michael Bugary. 
Three USC relievers pitched scoreless innings, and sophomore righthander Ryan Cabral finished it off in the ninth to lock down the 14-4 Trojans victory.
On top of being televised on Fox Sports West, Friday’s game had a lot to offer. Junior righthander Robert Stock tossed seven scoreless innings in what was also his final audition for MLB Draft scouts, and all of the Trojans’ runs came via the long ball.
O’Neill opened the game with a leadoff homer, and USC tacked on a Ricky Oropesa two-run shot in the sixth — his 13th of the season — and a Hector Rabago solo home run in the seventh.
Senior righthander Danny Cooper relieved Stock but ran into some trouble in the ninth inning, allowing two runs and putting the tying runners on second and third base. USC coach Chad Kreuter brought in freshman reliever Chad Smith, who recorded one out, then junior reliever Kevin Couture, who induced a fielder’s choice to end the game.
USC had been flirting with .500 over the season’s final few contests, and finished with an exactly .500 record at 28-28 overall. Interestingly enough, the 2008 Trojans’ record was the same, and the 2007 team went 27-29. That gives third-year head coach Chad Kreuter a 83-85 career record amid questions of whether he will be retained for next season. This season, the Trojans’ Pac-10 record was 13-14.

Bright spot · Jennifer Song, a freshman, finished runner-up overall to lead USC. - Jonathan Wong | Daily Trojan
The No. 3 women’s golf team fell just short of repeating the dream at the 2009 NCAA Championships last Friday at the Caves Valley Golf Club in Owings Mill, Md.
The Women of Troy, looking for their first-ever repeat national title, fell from first to third on the final day to finish at 39-over-par 1191 (301-295-294-301), nine strokes back of No. 1 Arizona State at 30-over 1182 (302-298-291-291) and one stroke back of No. 2 UCLA at 38-over 1190 (296-293-304-297). 
“When we made the turn the final day, ASU started making the birdies and we didn’t,” said Coach Andrea Gaston. tags
Freshman Jennifer Song led as an individual going into the final round and finished tied for second. Song finished at two-over 290 (72-73-71-74), one stroke back of Purdue’s Maria Hernandez. Song was hurt by her play on the 18th hole all week, finishing five-over in four tries. 
Song’s finish is her fourth consecutive in the top two, and her sixth top-three finish for the season. Song’s outing topped off a very successful freshman year for the Korean native. She finished with a season average of 71.55 strokes per round, a USC record and the lowest average in the nation.  
Song was named a First Team All-American and Freshman of the Year by the National Golf Coaches Association.
Sophomore Lizette Salas finished tied for 16th at 10-over 298 (74-74-75-75). A consistent top 10 finisher throughout the season, she acknowledged that she didn’t play her best. 
“I was hitting the ball well, but I wasn’t getting the breaks I wanted to on the greens,” she said. “But that’s golf.”  
Salas’ finish concludes a season in which she finished every tournament inside the top 18, and finished fourth in the nation for scoring. Her scoring average for the season was 71.82 strokes, the second lowest in school history behind Song. Salas also earned First Team All-American honors.
“I’m going to keep working hard, and try to get first team all American again, and maybe player of the year,” Salas said.
Junior Belen Mozo, last season’s fourth place finisher at the national championship, finished tied for 21st at 11-over 299 (78-72-73-76). Mozo became USC’s fourth three-time All-American when she was named to the Second Team this season. 
Junior Caroline Kim finished tied for 57th at 20-over 308 (77-76-79-76), highlighted by an even par back nine on the final day. Freshman In-Ah Park finished in a tie for 75th at 24-over 312 (79-79-75-79).
Though disappointed in its finish, the team is already looking ahead to next year. 
“I think they’re stronger for it, and I think they learned how to practice more effectively and manage the course better,” Gaston said.
“The way things happened this year, we’re not too happy with our results, and that’ll motivate us a lot for next season,” Salas said. 
The Women of Troy will return all their talent next season.
 “We’re returning our entire traveling roster, plus Stephanie Endstrasser (2008 All-American),” Gaston said. “We expect nothing less than to go after another national championship.”

On the courts, the Trojans had the heart. 
Sweet 17 · The USC men’s tennis team, seen here celebrating after its seminfinal win, had even more to celebrate a few days later when the Trojans defied the odds to win the school’s 17th national championship. -  Courtesy of USC Sports InformationOn paper, the Ohio State Buckeyes had the personnel to win the national championship.
It was that heart that propelled the No. 8 men’s tennis team (25-5) on its run through nationals to its 17th team title.  
Was it impossible? No. Improbable? Perhaps. In order to reach the championship round in College Station, Texas, the Trojans had to defeat No. 9 Stanford, No. 1 Virginia and No. 12 Texas. Then there were the No. 3 Buckeyes (36-2) who boasted five ranked singles players, three of whom were in the top 25. The Buckeyes had the advantage in the rankings on four of six courts. 
The Trojans, however, believed — after stunning undefeated Virginia in the quarterfinals — that anything was possible. 
“After we beat Virginia it was obvious that we could win,” sophomore Jaak Põldma said.
It started in doubles.
From the start, No. 4 junior Robert Farah and freshman Steve Johnson took control on court one. It wasn’t long before they served up a commanding 8-3 victory to Matt Allare and Justin Kronauge. 
One court over, Ohio State answered back and defeated No. 59 senior Abdullah Magdas and freshman Daniel Nguyen 8-4.
With the score tied, it was up to number three doubles to determine which team would take the doubles point.  
To start, the Buckeyes took a 2-0 lead, catching a break in the first game. Freshman Matt Kecki and Põldma, however, rallied to take a 6-4 lead. The Buckeyes came back to tie it at 6-6 and again at 7-7. The Trojans captured the next game to lead 8-7 and with the advantage in the final game, Põldma hit a winner to put away the match.
“Kecki played really well and we worked our way back into the match,” said Põldma of the initial deficit. 
“After we won doubles I told Robert, ‘we are winning this,’” Magdas added. 
Come time for singles, the Trojans capitalized on their advantage, winning three first sets. No. 106 Magdas was the first to take care of business when he defeated No. 113 Allare in straight sets 6-2, 6-3. 
“I didn’t pay much attention to his injury,” said Magdas of Allare, who had rolled his ankle the day prior. “I know he’s a good player, and it was dangerous because he is very competitive and got in my face every time he got the point.”
On court six, Nguyen made things look easy as he handily defeated Chase Buchanan 6-0, 6-3 to put the Trojans ahead 3-0. 
“I’ve played this guy [Buchanan] in juniors and he was a really good player who was supposed to go pro and I thought it would be closer,” said Nguyen. 
The Trojans only needed one more point to close out the Buckeyes.

“Magdas and Nguyen won their matches and as soon as they won, I thought: ‘This is happening, this is our day and I’m going to have to raise the level and start playing way tougher.’ And that’s what I did,” Farah said.
On court one, No. 8 Farah had lost his first set 5-7, but came back to win the second set 6-1. No. 53 Johnson took the first set from No. 9 Moneke in a tiebreaker and led in the second. On courts three and five, No. 81 Põldma and Kecki were fighting to stay alive. 
Ohio State got a point when No. 25 Kronauge defeated Põldma 7-6 (1), 6-4 despite several comeback efforts from the Trojan sophomore. At that moment the Buckeyes gathered some momentum and began to take control. 
“They are a singles team,” Magdas said. “Their one, two and three [singles] is as good as it gets and when the guy won at three I knew anything could happen.”
On court two, Steven Moneke came back in the second set to win four straight and defeat Johnson 6-4, sending them into a third set where the players were trading games. On court five, Kecki saw No. 74 Balazs Novak come roaring back to take the set 7-5.  They were 3-3 in the second. Farah was in a situation similar to Johnson, trading games in the third. 
Farah was the first of the Trojans with an opportunity to clinch. He went up 5-3, but Bryan Koniecko won the next game to stay alive 5-4.  At 5-4, Farah took control of his serve and Koniecko struggled to return the ball. Farah led 40-15 when he aced Koniecko to secure the national championship.
“I just threw my racket up in the air, laid on the ground and closed my eyes,” Farah said. “I just couldn’t believe it.” 
It was a long road to the title indeed. On several occasions the crowd and statistics were not in their favor, but the Trojans fought on regardless. 
“We had the crowd against us every single match,” Kecki said. “You just have to get used to it.” 
Kecki received All-Tournament doubles honors at the three position along with partner Põldma. 
“That was definitely a highlight,” Põldma said.
Nguyen received All-Tournament singles honors at the number six position. 
Farah received All-Tournament honors at number one singles and number one doubles with partner Johnson. He was also the tournament MVP. 
“It might be the best feeling ever,” Farah said of the victory.
Prior to the season, Kecki and Johnson wrote in their player biographies that their dream was to win an NCAA championship. On Tuesday, they saw that dream become a reality.

Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
During USC’s graduation ceremony, a certain governor of California made a speech that entertained and awed, proving the somewhat-obvious fact that the Governator already knows how to work a crowd. Sadly, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has yet to figure out how to lower a constantly mounting state deficit, and there is no pretending that a bazooka can blow that away.
Yet, during the commencement ceremony, Schwarzenegger was given an honorary degree from USC. Whether or not a successful career portraying a cyborg assassin and apparent political aspirations turned stark reality garner an “honorary degree” is debatable. But, no harm, no foul. Let Arny have his degree — after all, charisma takes people places. Well, most of the time.
In contrast is President Barack Obama, a graduate of Harvard Law, a former senator of Illinois and the first Black president in U.S. history. According to Arizona State University, however, his “body of work” is still forthcoming and therefore didn’t merit an honorary degree during the ASU commencement proceedings. Obama gave the speech and went about his day without a degree to show for it.
ASU is often known for its raucous parties, if not its stellar academics — in an interview with Jason Jones of “The Daily Show,” a student called ASU the “Harvard of scholastics,” to which Jones  responded with the obvious retort: “Wouldn’t that be Harvard?” Meanwhile, a man who has topped multiple milestones decided to speak at this center for knowledge and, in return, found no love. Is it possible that Obama’s non-existent degree is representative of  Arizona’s bitterness? After all, a certain senator from the Grand Canyon state was defeated last November.
Making ASU look even more foolish in comparison, the University of Notre Dame gave the president an honorary doctorate later in the week. The school did so against the wishes of many of its alumni and current students, who oppose Obama’s stance on abortion. Yet, even amid this controversy, the school didn’t refuse Obama a degree — realizing, perhaps, that a degree that carries the school’s seal doesn’t necessarily carry the clout of the institution, especially when all the degree holder did at the school was speak at a commencement ceremony. 
Meanwhile, many students in attendance at the Tempe commencement ceremony battled through raging hangovers to hear the president speak. Hopefully, ASU and any other biased universities will learn that honorary degrees are more pomp and circumstance than watermarks of achievement.
It’s difficult to say whether or not Obama will ever come to USC to receive the same treatment Schwarzenegger did — I’m sure there were a few parents and graduates who would have much rather heard him speak. In the meantime, there’s always hoping that good old W. will stop by. He’s earned it.

If Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has his way, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will soon be for sale, and USC could be a candidate to buy the property, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The L.A. Coliseum (File)
The Coliseum was one of a handful of properties that Schwarzenegger proposed selling in his newest budget, a plan that aims to raise between $600 million and $1 billion to provide relief for the state’s financial crisis.
The proposal is preliminary, as it is uncertain whether legislature to sell the various properties would pass. In light of the failure of all but one of the governor’s May 19 budget proposals, selling the Coliseum may become a more viable option.
USC would be a natural fit to buy the Coliseum if it were to go to sale. Before the school was able to resolve a standoff with the Coliseum Commission last year, it had offered $100 million in exchange for the power to run the Coliseum as it saw fit. 
“If that were the only way to ensure the Coliseum would be improved and maintained for its current uses, for the right price the university would have to consider it,” said Kristina Raspe, USC’s associate senior vice president for real estate and asset management, according to The Times. 
The proposal has also drawn criticism, however, from politicians who believe that estimates for the national historic landmark are being inflated.
“If anybody thinks that you’re going to get $250 million or $400 million for this property, guess again,” Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, president of the Coliseum Commission, told the Times. “I’ve got some beachfront property in Nebraska I’d like to interest you in.”

Straight shooter · Christian Bale (above) stars as John Connor in “Terminator Salvation,” the fourth installment in the franchise, which takes place in the year 2018. - Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros. 
When Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was a struggling actor trying to find a legitimate niche in the early 1980s, a script written by James Cameron came across his path. It was about a man sent back in time to protect the mother of a future leader from a machine programmed to kill her. The only choice for Schwarzenegger was to play the machine. Twenty plus years later, a leader has been born in a chaotic atmosphere, both on and offscreen. 
Now Schwarzenegger plays a governor of a bankrupt economy, and John Connor (Christian Bale) is finally fighting in a future his mother always warned him about. The franchise has entered the future and left Arny and his one-liners; this is a more vile and bleak situation with very little to laugh about.
In “Terminator Salvation,” director McG takes over the post- Judgment Day reigns and creates a desolate world circa 2018, where terminators run rampant and Skynet is in control. Only the Resistance, human survivors, can stop it — with John there to lead the way.  Unfortunately, John has detractors that don’t feel he is the chosen one. Head quarters wishes to attack Skynet when it finds a weakness in its frequencies. To do so would also lead to the termination of John, as Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), John’s father, would be killed while being held prisoner at the base
Confused yet? 
To make matters even more convulted, John has to deal with Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a man who gave his body up for Cyberdine Technologies after his execution for murder. The question that plagues John and Marcus is what is he? A machine, a man, or perhaps both? Marcus could be a key to the evolution of the machines and the campaign against them. 
Worthington, an unknown from Australia, has arrived. His character — a machine with a human heart, brain, blood and skin — is the most complex and the most alluring considering Marcus is new to the franchise.  Marcus is the central character and in essence portrays the protector amongst all the confusion. Marcus is a diamond in the rough and is quite impressive as he steals the show. 
Despite the film’s departure from the mundane third installment and its return to a more exciting, if not louder and more explosive, saga, it is not without its flaws. One flaw comes in the form of Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood), who serves very little purpose other than advancing the plot and further showcasing Marcus’ ability for compassion and human characteristics. 
It is also notable that this film shares similarities with Michael Bay’s “Transformers.” Tons of explosions plus large two-legged transforming machines are abundant in McG’s vision, giving Bay’s complaints of plagiarism some validity.
The film’s brilliant cinematography, from director of photography Shane Hurlbut, is showcased in the adrenaline-filled action scenes. - Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros.
The film’s ultimate flaw, however, lies in the audience already knowing that Marcus is a cyborg. They see it in the ad campaign and are given a back-story out the gate. Sadly, it allows for a less than shocking reveal instead of a powerful turning point. As a result, the audience is forced to sit through the majority of the film wondering when the story will hit its curve. 
Some questionable acting and dialogue also detracts from the film, specifically from Bloodgood and Bryce  Dallas Howard (Kate Connor), who star as the only major female characters in the film. Both needed to be fleshed out to make the film whole and less of a launch pad for two future sequels. It also doesn’t help that Howard was obviously pregnant during principal photography, yet her physical state is never mentioned. Howard was an emergency back-up for the role of Kate, so it remains to be seen whether or not the character will give birth between this film and the next.
On the positive front, the film’s CGI is stellar, especially when highlighted by the cinematography. Director of Photography Shane Hurlbut’s work is profound, and one easily wonders if the film would have been as effective without it. Though the action sequences benefit the most from the camera work, the scene that truly sticks out is the helicopter sequence near the beginning of the film. As John attempts to escape in the helicopter, he is shot down; everything that ensues in the long take toes the line between prolific and extraordinary. 
It’s also interesting to note Bale’s fallout with Hurlbut. The now infamous incident is what many filmgoers are hoping to get a glimpse of; however, editing is smooth enough to ensure a difficult flagging point as to where the blow up took place. 
Also, Hurlbut’s light work makes “Terminator Salvation” legitimate, and it even takes the attention away from Bale, though the script or McG could be at fault for that.  
“Terminator Salvation” is a solid action flick that should make summer moviegoers happy. The film is not “T2,” but it is a far cry from the sub-par “T3.” This installment feels a lot more like the original “Terminator” — though bleak and brooding, there is hope for the future of the human race and this franchise after all.

When “It’s a Wonderful Life” is brought up in conversation, people immediately picture Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore in Frank Capra’s 1946 motion picture; however, the one-man show that is currently playing at Two Roads Theatre in Studio City, Calif. with the same title is not exactly an adaptation. What takes place in the petite theater in between coffee and knick-knack shops is an intimate story of a life of hardship, strife and turmoil, and how it was turned around to make a difference.   
The tiny theater, which is entirely painted black, has no set decoration or props in the room, except for three square wooden boxes in the center of the stage and a couple of red lights to accent the floor in addition to the standard stage lighting. The room is completely silent — that is, until a tall, dark (okay, and handsome) figure comes out from behind the curtain to the left, a man dressed in  very simple attire: a white T-shirt, blue jeans and a pair of dressed-up work boots, with his hair pulled up in a neat chaos of dreadlocks and braids. The minute the curtain opens, a smile forms on his face and he greets the audience.   
His name is Charles Michael Edmonds, although the audience soon discovers that he goes by “Mike.” He begins to explain that his “It’s a Wonderful Life” is a story about his struggle with a major cocaine addiction and how Capra’s movie has helped him maintain his sobriety in a tale that is the perfect mix of melancholy and empowerment.   
Edmonds paints the scene by explaining the first time he came in contact with cocaine, his eventual drug of choice. His four friends and he had decided to take an impromptu trip from New York to Washington, D.C. to meet up with their senior class that was there on a trip. Somewhere along the way, his friends came in contact with cocaine and were planning to sell it. While his friends ended up trying the drug, Edmonds decided against it. 
That is, however, until about two weeks after that trip was over. Almost immediately, Edmonds becomes a victim of an addiction, though he refused to believe he was in trouble. That refusal continued long into his recovery time at a drug rehabilitation center in Minnesota, which wasn’t quite the picture-perfect vision of a facility by the beach that he was looking forward to.  
Each day of Edmonds’ detox brought new challenges that he would face, along with new eye-opening epiphanies. 
His regimen started his path toward the realization that everyone around him had a problem, though he, of course, was fine. It did not take long, however, until Edmonds began to see that if all of these people had the same problems he did, he might just be a little worse off than he had ever imagined. 
The rest of Edmonds’ story depicts the struggle he had with his family, his  so-called friends and himself as he tried to get through life while on cocaine. 
Each moment of his tribulations through rehab showed a different side of Edmonds, and while he tells the story, you can literally see the man called “Mike” change before your eyes. 
The man who began the rehab process by stating, “This is why we get high — we don’t like feelings,” begins to take that feeling into account and learns how to change his life so that feelings not only become more bearable, but also something necessary to living his life.Edmonds relates this effortlessly to the main protagonist (played by Jimmy Stewart) in the film version of “It’s a Wonderful Life,” as he feels like he is getting a second chance in a similar way to Stewart’s character.   
While the writing of Edmonds’ story is stunning and enticing, it could not have been performed by anyone else. 
The way Edmonds acts out each scene is so intricately detailed, it makes the audience feel like it is in the rehab facility with him, despite the fact that Edmonds is sitting alone on an empty, dark stage. His stage presence is enough to force the audience into laughter, tears and astonishment with every word that hangs off of his lips.  
“It’s a Wonderful Life” is running every Friday and Saturday night at 8 p.m. from now until June 27.

Orange you glad? · La Grande Orange recently opened its third establishment on the ever-popular Main Street in Santa Monica, Calif. 
Heading south on Main Street in Santa Monica, Calif., where the yuppie city bleeds into Venice Beach — Santa Monica’s free-spirited younger sibling — the area takes on a different shape. The stores are smaller and less commercial, while the atmosphere suddenly switches to relaxed and care-free.
Back in the late 1960’s, this stretch of shops and cafes belonged to Los Angeles’s flower children. The corner of Main and Bicknell streets was the epicenter, where a red-brick fire station housed the cafe Le Boulangerie, the ultimate meeting place for the paisley-clad hipsters. 
Forty years later, there’s a new kid on the block, housed in that very same firehouse, albeit a cool gray instead of brick-red. Though the people have changed since then, that casual yet slightly quirky attitude is still the same. 
La Grande Orange, which opened in Santa Monica only several weeks ago, is the third restaurant installment by owner and creator Bob Lynn, who opened the inaugural La Grande Orange in Phoenix, Ariz. with a second location in Pasadena, Calif. following shortly thereafter. 
Like the exterior, La Grande Orange’s interior bears only a few remnants left over from the firehouse of the past — high ceilings, arched walls and dark brick paneling. These old-school touches are infused with modern updates, including slate-hued couches lined against the brick wall, tea lights dotting the wood tables and a semi-circular bar enclosing the corner of the room. A plasma-screen television hangs just to the left of the bar, tuned in to various sports games (although our waitress claimed they were showing black and white films the other day). 
An expansive white canvas hanging on the brick wall reads one simple word in — what else? — orange lettering, “yes.” After a heated discussion over the meaning of this simple decor, our waitress gave us her interpretation of the art work: “Why say no? Just say yes.” 
Thus begins your meal, which is hardly limited to an entree and a replenishing glass of water, at La Grande Orange. Everything on the menu is so intriguingly eclectic — your standard American, Asian and Mexican dishes with an unexpected twist — that you find yourself saying “yes” to just about everything your dining guest or server suggests. 
For the first round of drinks, we’re told the house favorite is the Shakin’ Lemonade, which includes a splash of Grey Goose vodka and an $8 price-tag. True to its name, the drink is prepared fresh at the table, shaken by the server in a stout glass jar.  After the first sip, it is clear why this sweet-yet-refreshing drink is popular among customers. The draft beer, which is just a dash bitter, is equally satisfying at $5 a glass. 
Fitting tastefully with the draft beer and alcoholic lemonade are the heavy-duty appetizers, or “Things We Put on Chips.” Though a slim selection, the plentiful plates are hard to pass up. Seafood lovers will find themselves drawn to the shrimp cerviche or tuna tartare, while non- seafood lovers are left with a single option: the chicken nachitos. Thin, crisp, perfectly shaped triangles topped with melted cheese, guacamole and shredded chicken, piled slightly lopsided in a gigantic ceramic bowl — more than enough to make you forget that it’s costing you a pretty $13.95. 
In a getting-to-know-the-neighborhood way, La Grande Orange is showcasing local farmers from the Santa Monica Farmer’s Market by offering several vegetable dishes as bonus appetizers. The tray of endives sprinkled with dates and cheese proves to be the best choice for your buck, the flavors complementing each other so unexpectedly. 
Beef lovers get their fix with the exotic hamburger dishes that stray from the standard, all-American cheeseburger (though for wary eaters, La Grande Orange has that, too) with the green chili burger, topped with roasted poblano chilies and grated cheddar cheese, and the ahi tuna burger, served with avocado, lettuce, tomato and fresh-grated ginger. All burgers are served on a fluffy bun that is anything but stale. Just be sure to take it down a notch when ordering; my medium- well burger was brought to the table painfully charred. 
Even the Mexican dishes flirt with the sea, the swordfish soft tacos platter easily reigning supreme over the chicken and steak platters. At $16.95, the price is somewhat steep; yet as you wonder if the waitress even got your order correct (in a “I can’t believe swordfish tastes this good” way) it’s worth it. 
When you’re about to relapse into a food coma, the dessert menu arrives. Chocolate fanatics will have a hey-day with the creamy chocolate pudding or the fluffy “magic brownie,” served with a swirl of whipped cream and a sizable scoop of vanilla ice cream. 
Also notable, and non-chocolate, is the raspberry crisp, which mixes just the perfect amount of gooey and crispy textures to form a sweet deliciousness on your palate. And as always, the raspberries are straight from the farmer’s market only a few miles away. Top off dessert with one of La Grande Orange’s red or white sangrias — the waitress ensures us there is no better pairing. 
If you don’t have time for a sit-down meal, La Grande Orange also has a take-out section at the front of the establishment, offering an extensive breakfast, lunch and dinner menu. 
Keeping to the flavor of the neighborhood with its vibrant dishes, one can only hope that La Grande Orange doesn’t become a franchise but stays a best-kept secret in Phoenix, Pasadena and its newfound home in Santa Monica.

Night shift · Ben Stiller stars as Larry Daley in “Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonia,” the sequel to blockbuster hit, “Night of the Museum.” Hank Azaria and Amy Adams also star in the sequel. - Photo Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox.
Stiller’s character, Larry Daley, no longer works for the museum, but has his own inventions company, Daley Devices. Bogged down by the corporate structure, he visits the Natural History museum — only to discover that the board has decided to donate most of the exhibits to the Smithsonian to make room for stale digital holograms.  
Of course, this means that Larry has to venture to Washington, D.C. to save the friends he has abandoned for his businessman life. Along the way, he meets a charmingly dimwitted Gen. George Armstrong Custer, played by a mustached Bill Hader, and an adorably spunky Amelia Earheart, played by doe-eyed Amy Adams.
Together, they must fight against the evil Kahmunrah (a tunic-wearing Hank Azaria), the tyrannical older brother of New York’s Ahkmenrah, whose magical tablet has the awesome ability to animate museum exhibits by moonlight.Animated sculptures, paintings and even national monuments come alive as historical figures battle for control of Kahmunrah’s tablet, which also has the power to unleash frightening undead warriors that help the owner of the tablet achieve world domination. 
Much of “Smithsonian” focuses  on Larry and Amelia’s efforts to thwart Kahmunrah. Disappointingly, there is virtually none of the delightful antics of Robin Williams’ rough riding President Teddy Roosevelt and his awkward, but heartwarming romance with the majestic Sacajawea — they merely appear at the beginning and end of the movie. 
Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan also reprise their roles as the tiny models Jedediah and Octavius, respectively, and please viewers with their silly, farcical interactions with the “gigantors” in Washington.    
“Smithsonian” spends a little too much time trying to wow the audience with lights and noise. The sequel’s special effects are dragged out and copious, even to the point of redundancy. Although this decision may favor itself to its IMAX platform, the film could have easily shaved off at least 15 minutes of gratuitous 3D fart jokes and melodrama.  
Stiller’s performance does not help either. His shtick as a frustrated jerk leaves a bad taste in the mouth because of its ill placement in a children’s movie that tries too hard to separate itself from other films. No amount of talking statues, flying rocket ships or period costumes can compensate for the truly imaginative quality that makes a great family movie.  
It is also obvious that Azaria has been watching a lot of “Family Guy.” Not only does his voice of Kahmunrah sound exactly like Stewie, but Azaria also lends his voice to other minor characters in the Smithsonian — including a very large Abraham Lincoln.  His performance is amusing, but too small for the big screen. In effect, his silly gesturing and preposterous accents may break the occasional chuckle, but don’t have the same effect as “Family Guy” characters have on passive viewers on the couch.
It is Adams’ enchanting Amelia Earheart that really carries the film. She’s moxie-filled, strong, and brings out a sympathy in Stiller that has not been seen since “Zoolander.” Only Adams could deliver marvel and humanity to a film that drags out stale, predictable jokes and tries to depend on recognizable guest cameos to spice up the film. 
Among these cameos are  “Waiting for Guffman” director Christopher Guest, who plays Ivan the Terrible, and Jonah Hill, who makes an appearance as Brandon,

It’s déjà vu, all over again. 
This morning, amid the bustle of Obama’s Supreme Court justice nomination, as rumors flew fast and hard surrounding  North Korea’s so-called missile testing, and gossip mills were abuzz in the aftermath of Monday night’s explosive “Jon & Kate Plus 8” episode (only in America are we so fascinated with offspring in multiples of eight), Proposition 8 was upheld. 
When Prop 8 originally passed, having garnered the support of 52 percent of California’s voters, protestors (the other 48 percent) reacted apoplectically across the country. There was something similar in the tableau outside the California Supreme Court in San Francisco Tuesday morning, as peals of boos and cries of condemnation swept the crowd. 
Attempts to hold the court responsible are misguided, however, as it was the court of public opinion that faltered in November, jilting many Californians out of a once-constitutional right. 
While the spirit of the times seems to be concentrating its retaliatory oomph on the court that ratified the voters’ decision, or the governor who upheld this ratification, ultimately, the responsibility comes to rest with those who did (or didn’t vote) Nov. 4. 
Enthusiasm and fervor can only carry a movement so far — if Californians don’t consummate their ardency with a checked box, they have no one to blame but themselves. In the end, the supporters of Prop 8 were more dedicated than the opponents, and the vote swayed to “Yes.”
Pundits say the issue of gay marriage might make another appearance on California ballots as soon as 2010, at which point we can only hope the California voters’ blasé attitude toward constitutional rights has changed. 
The time to protest the court’s decision is through; opponents of Prop 8 should instead focus on regrouping for an inevitable rematch, at which time we can only hope they will be better prepared to gather votes — not just gusto.

While many students are able to choose their final projects for the semester, one class took the opportunity to create a project that would benefit more than just grades.
Every semester in Professor Haven Lin-Kirk’s Fine Arts 302 Design III class, students take on a final project they select as a class. This semester, Tom Buchte, who graduated May 15 with a degree in business administration, came up with the idea of creating shoes.
“At first I suggested that we buy and redo a car, but there were just too many logistical problems. Then, I suggested that we design shoes,” Buchte said. “Shoes would allow all the students to have individual projects within a larger collaborative effort.”
The class of 20 was divided into five groups to brainstorm ideas for the final project. After Buchte and his group’s proposition for shoes was approved by the class, the project was put into action. 
Jonathan Igner, a senior majoring in business administration and a member of Buchte’s group, contacted Vans, who then donated 22 pairs of white slip-on canvas shoes to the project.
“I asked if we could get the shoes at a decreased price,” Igner said. “Over the weekend, Jonathan Chow, another student in our group, came up with the idea of giving the shoes to charity after they were finished. So, I shot the Vans contact an e-mail and we ended up getting them for free.”
The finished Vans designed by the class were donated to Soles4Souls, an organization that accepts donations of shoes or money and distributes shoes to those in need in various countries. The charity — which began as a relief effort after the 2004 Asian tsunami — has distributed nearly two million pairs of shoes worldwide.
After the class decided to work with Soles4Souls, students had to complete the project using a budget of $1,000 from Roski. While each student designed a shoe, the class was broken down into different groups that organized various aspects of the project — including advertising, marketing and communication.
Chandler Chow, a senior majoring in fine arts, led the group that created a 56-page booklet of the shoes designed.
“We wanted to represent each student and designer,” Chow said. “Each person had a page where we displayed their shoe and asked them some questions, like what their motivation was. With the book we really wanted to focus on the design aspect of the project.”
The shoes were displayed in the USC Fisher Museum of Art and auctioned on eBay, where 13 pairs of shoes were sold beginning at $50 per pair. The class plans to sell the remaining nine pairs of shoes it designed on eBay at reduced prices.
Overall, students said they learned from the experience.
“It was the biggest job I have worked on,” Chow said. “And the biggest design project many in our class have ever worked on.”

The California Supreme Court upheld Proposition 8 Tuesday, affirming the ban on same-sex marriage that voters approved last year.
While the justices were split 6-1 regarding the constitutionality of the proposition — which was passed with a 52 percent vote in November’s election — they unanimously agreed that the marriages of as many as 18,000 same-sex couples will be recognized under state law.
In the majority decision, Chief Justice Ronald M. George wrote that because same-sex couples still have the right to civil unions, Prop 8 did “not entirely repeal or abrogate” their right to “choose one’s life partner and enter with that person into a committed, officially recognized and protected family relationship that enjoys all of the constitutionally based incidents of marriage.”
Rather, George wrote, voters chose to reserve the “official designation of the term ‘marriage’ for the union of opposite-sex couples as a matter of state constitutional law.”
In addition to rejecting arguments that Prop 8 was an illegal constitutional revision, the court also denied contentions that the proposition unconstitutionally affected an inalienable right.
While justices said it was “inappropriate” to decide whether or not same-sex marriages performed outside California would be recognized by the state, they voted to uphold existing California marriages that took place before Prop 8 was passed. 
“The marriages of same-sex couples performed prior to the effective date of Proposition 8 remain valid and must continue to be recognized in this state,” George wrote.
Despite this decision, protests broke out in cities across the state — including San Francisco and Los Angeles — as opponents of Prop 8 expressed their dismay that the decision was upheld.
At USC, however, many students said they were not surprised by the decision.
“It’s never a good thing to hear that you’ve had your rights taken away from you, but it honestly was less of a surprise after the whole Prop 8 thing,” said Chris Dunford, one of the founders of the Equal Marriage Rights Initiative at USC, a new organization founded on campus after Prop 8 was approved.
Genevieve Flores, executive director of USC’s Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Assembly, said while she was not surprised by the ruling, she had hoped the court would intervene.
“Honestly, the Supreme Court should have stepped in,” Flores said. “It’s usually up to the Supreme Court to uphold the rights of minorities.”
In a statement from USC College Republicans, Director of Public Relations Lauren Korbatov said while group members had different political opinions regarding Prop 8, the organization agreed with the legal decision made by the court.
“The California Supreme Court ruled today that Proposition 8 was a legal constitutional amendment passed by California voters, and we agree with the legal merits of this assessment,” the statement said. “Our membership has diverse views on the political debate surrounding Proposition 8, and we therefore do not endorse a position on the political aspects of the controversy.”
Political experts said the future of Prop 8 is still unclear, as many opponents have vowed to again present the proposition to voters again — including in the upcoming 2010 election.
Flores agreed, saying it was up to voters to repeal Prop 8.
“The ball’s back in our court,” Flores said.

A new bill signed into law by President Barack Obama Friday attempts to regulate the credit card industry and protect consumers, but places restrictions on college students that some say are overprotective and could be harmful in the long run.
The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act, which passed in both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate with large majorities, attempts to prevent credit card companies from taking advantage of consumers and is expected to have a large impact on the way college students open and use credit cards. 
Specifically, the Credit CARD Act prevents credit card companies from offering gifts on or near college campuses in exchange for applications, and requires any colleges to make public any agreements they may have with credit card companies. 
“Colleges should not be encouraging their students to sign up for products with high interest rates and fees that can get them bogged down in debt,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who voted in favor of the bill, said in a press release. “Young consumers often do not have the knowledge and experience to manage their credit wisely and as a result can get into deep financial trouble that can stay with them for decades.”
The bill also stipulates that anyone between the ages of 18 to 21 looking to open a credit card either prove they can pay their own expenses or have a parent or guardian co-sign for the card and assume joint liability. If a parent or guardian co-signs for the card, that parent must also approve all changes to the credit limit.
With credit card use increasing among young people, many believe the Credit CARD Act will help students avoid incurring unnecessary debt. Others, however, worry that the decrease in the availability of credit at a time when students are relying on it most will lead young people to find other ways to finance their education and their lifestyles. Some are also concerned that the bill decreases the sense of financial responsibility in young people. 
Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies for the Cato Institute, a non-profit public policy research foundation, said he was concerned about the effects the bill will have and said he believes some middle ground could have been reached. 
One problem with the bill, Calabria said, is that it will make college students less financially sophisticated.
“You really aren’t getting at the ability for people to learn how to manage credit,” Calabria said. “Regardless of your age, there will always be a day that will be your first day or your first year having a credit card. And it’s like anything else … if you’ve never had one you don’t know how to use one in a broad sense. So the question is, just because this person’s 25 rather than 21, are they really that much more sophisticated about it, or that much more knowledgeable about it if they haven’t experienced it?” 
A recent study published by student lender Sallie Mae showed that students are having more trouble handling their credit card debt than ever before. The study, which surveyed students who had applied for a private loan through Sallie Mae, found that only 17 percent of students who reported using a credit card paid of all their cards each month. Of the graduating seniors surveyed, the average debt was $4,100.
The study also found that one-third of credit card users did not discuss their credit card use with their parents. Proponents of the bill hope that requiring this section of the student population to communicate with their parents will decrease the average amount of debt and encourage responsible use of credit cards. 
Gail Cunningham, vice president for public relations at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, supported the bill, saying that requiring parent involvement will help ease students in to using a credit card. 
“[Students after college] are just older and they’ve had access to credit so hopefully they’ve responsibly used it,” Cunningham said. “What I like about the bill is that the parents can go online any time of the day or night and review the student’s spending and if they’re not playing by the rules they can remove him as an authorized user. So, to me it’s the best of both worlds — they have access to credit, the opportunity to manage it responsibly and get a few years under their belt of maturity before they get their own card.”
While students said they understood the reason for the new requirements, and agreed there was a problem with college students overspending, some did not agree with the bill.
Isaac Muscanto, a sophomore majoring in cinema-television critical studies, said he was glad he already had a credit card and would not need to give his parents joint ownership. He said he found the new regulations to be too protective of students.
“It’s natural students are going to put themselves at risk, but at 18 that is their responsibility,” Muscanto said.
Ron Hill, a freshman majoring in cinema-television production, said he is considering getting a credit card to use for emergencies that may arise when he gets to college. Though Hill said he did not think he would be affected much by the bill, he did not entirely agree with it.
“My generation does have a problem with controlling their spending and credit cards can dangerous for someone my age,” Hill said. “Clearly a credit card is not something that should be entered into lightly, and parents should be involved with their children’s spending on some level — I’m just not sure this bill is the right way to go about it.”
Lauren Dawson, a sophomore majoring in international relations, already has her own credit card, but said she doesn’t think the regulations will change much in the long run.
“College students are graduating with higher and higher levels of credit card debt because they are using them improperly. I don’t think having parents’ oversee the card would change anything, though,” Dawson said.
Like many students, Calabria said he thought that a compromise could have been met with the bill, and that a cap on credit extended to students might have been a better solution.
Will Price, a sophomore majoring in engineering, agreed that the bill was not the right solution.
“It sounds like they are well-intentioned, but I think it’s a restriction of freedom,” Price said.
