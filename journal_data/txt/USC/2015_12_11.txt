A fatal collision involving a Department of Public Safety officer and a USC student is the subject of an ongoing Los Angeles Police Department investigation, according to DPS and the Los Angeles Times. 
The crash occurred at 6:30 a.m. on Dec. 3 along Jefferson Boulevard, near USC Gate 4,  DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said. The victim was Kelsey Dresser, a first-year graduate student in the Rossier School of Education. According to the LA Times, Dresser was driving westbound on Jefferson when she made a left turn and was hit by a DPS vehicle driving eastbound. 
The name of the DPS officer, who remains off-duty while recovering from the collision, has remained confidential, and DPS has declined to say whether he sustained any injuries. 
Dresser, who suffered brain damage as a result of the crash, was taken to a local hospital, where she died the following day. 
The 23-year-old student graduated from the University of California Santa Barbara in 2014 with a degree in psychology, according to the LA Times. She had worked to support students with mental health issues and conducted research at an autism center. 
According to Carlisle, DPS is awaiting the report from the LAPD. 
“Once we receive the final report from the LAPD, these types of serious traffic collisions have several levels of review,” Carlisle said. “We will review the content of the report and see if there is anything that we can do keep that from happening again in the future.”
On Dec. 7, DPS Chief John Thomas released a statement offering “our deepest condolences to Kelsey’s family, friends, classmates and faculty.”
“Our officers dedicate themselves to protecting our students, staff, faculty and everyone who visits the university,” Thomas said. “This is an unprecedented and heartbreaking event for our department.”

Each year, Christmas brings a few of the best artists of all time together to sing carols and traditional Christmas songs. You will hear these songs all over the radio stations starting days before Thanksgiving all the way through the New Year. Some of the top artists on the charts have capitalized on this time of year to release full albums of Christmas favorites. Whether jazz or pop, these albums have become radio hits overnight for the Christmas season. Check out these timeless albums to bring up that holiday spirit during finals. 
1. Michael Bublé – Christmas (2011)
We all absolutely adore Bublé for his subtle charm and dashing good looks, but his voice adds even more to his overall appeal. Putting his own spin on classics like “ Oh Tannenbaum” and “God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman,” Bublé impresses with his glorious jazz vocals. This perfect combination of a vintage sound with Bublé’s old-world vocal style and a modern twist, this album is perfect for getting in the Christmas spirit.
The King of Rock took Christmas by storm with his unique vocals in this old-school album. Everyone loves Elvis, and paying homage to this American icon is easy while listening to his Rock ‘n’ Roll take on classics like “White Christmas” and “Silent Night.”
3. John Denver – A Rocky Mountain Christmas (1975)
Most people may not know who John Denver is, but anyone who does can attest to his talent. His folk-country sound is haunting and melancholic in a way that makes you wish you could take a trip down a country road. Acoustic guitar and gentle vocals define traditional Christmas tunes like “Silver Bells,” but with country inclusions like “Christmas for Cowboys” and “Aspenglow” that make this album unique.
4. Glee Cast – The Christmas Album (2010)
We all love Glee albums, and this one doesn’t disappoint, featuring vocals from the original cast. Artist k.d. Lang even makes an appearance on this cheery album in the song, “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch” with Matthew Morrison. This album is perfect for a Christmas party or a car jam session. 
With the dawn of a new age of Justin Bieber (something we are all very grateful for), it’s important to remember his somewhat humble beginnings. This Christmas album is definitely one to listen to this holiday season featuring pre-sex symbol Biebs crooning away on favorites like “Santa Claus is Coming to Town” and his original song “Mistletoe.” 
A timeless classic album for all Mariah Carey fans — enough said. After all, we’ve all held hairbrushes and sung along to “All I Want for Christmas is You.” This pop diva nails each song she sings, Christmas album and all.
Before Michael Jackson was the King of Pop, he was a young artist in a family of musical geniuses. This motown-pop inspired Christmas album features the young Jackson’s singing hits, from “I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus” to “Frosty the Snowman.” A true classic in honor of the late Mr. Jackson, this album is a real trip down memory lane.
