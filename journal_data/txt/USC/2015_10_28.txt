Five-year-old Jonny Maldonado was born with a tiny hand and just two fingers. People with his condition have only one option — an expensive 15-pound claw-like prosthesis — and young patients outgrow their prosthetics too quickly to make it a viable treatment.
However, thanks to groundbreaking 3-D printing technology and the hard work of the USC Freehand Project, Jonny was fitted with a custom-made “super-hand” that lets him play baseball and ride a bike just like other kids.
The Freehand Project, which was founded last September by senior mechanical engineering major Alison Glazer and alumna Kara Tanaka, utilizes 3-D printers to create prosthetic hands for kids like Jonny. Tanaka was inspired to start the club after hearing about the work done by e-NABLE, a network of volunteers who deliver 3-D printed hands all around the globe. She approached Glazer, the president of the 3-D printing club 3D For Everyone, to unite Tanaka’s medical background with 3D4E’s engineering expertise.
“This project invited other people — we had artists, architects — people who were looking for a different entry into 3-D printing,” Tanaka said. “Everybody’s coming in and bringing in a little bit of what they know, and together they’re building a bigger project.”
Using schematics provided by e-NABLE, the club has already supplied dozens of hands to Syria and Haiti. They have also joined forces with local children’s hospitals to custom build prosthetics for children in Los Angeles. Encouraged by their success, 3D4E incorporated Project Freehand as a permanent branch of their club this semester.
Maddie McCarthy, director of operations at 3D4E, said the Freehand Project has received support from AIO Robotics, a startup founded by three USC Ph.D. students.
“We were fortunate enough to partner with [AIO]. We were lucky enough to get two of their printers,” McCarthy said. “The more printers we get, the more people we can help and reach.”
At the end of each semester, after printing the hands, the Freehand Project delivers them to e-NABLE director of programs, Maria Esquela, who coordinates troops of Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts in Baltimore, Maryland, to assemble the hands.
However, things don’t always go as planned. From snowstorms causing chaos last winter to a wave of protests this spring that erupted after 25-year-old Freddie Gray died in police custody and led the government to declare a state of emergency in Baltimore, the Scouts have worked hard to deliver the hands to Syrian children intact and on-time.
“It was difficult to get across Baltimore because Baltimore was in a state of civil disturbance,” Esquela said. “My daughter and I drove past tanks and people with machine guns and heavy body armor.”
In spite of the difficulties, Esquela praised the Freehand Project and the Scouts for volunteering their time to help out children in need.
“This project transformed us, and it made us connect with a team that was bigger,” Esquela said. “It became a very powerful thing for us to feel like we were able to connect with a team that was trying to help people.”
The club has grown tremendously since it began. Last year, 3D4E only had around 30 members, and now there are over 70 students involved in the Freehand Project alone. Moving forward, the team hopes to expand and connect with more partners in Southern California. They are now printing hands for children in Sierra Leone.
McCarthy recalled one of her most memorable experiences working with the Freehand Project, which occurred when the group custom-printed hands for children in Los Angeles.
“Each 3D4E team member was actually able to put the hand on the child that they printed it for. This was my first time seeing the hands in use,” McCarthy said. “Watching a kid pick up something with his new hand was probably one of the most amazing moments I’ve ever experienced.”

Students gathered on Wednesday afternoon in Doheny Memorial Library to watch the third Republican presidential debate.
The event was hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the Political Student Assembly, which have hosted the previous Republican and Democratic debates.
Prior to the debate, Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, moderated a panel featuring Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics and professor of the practice of political science Bob Shrum and Fox News political analyst Doug Schoen.
The debate which was hosted by CNBC, focused on the economy and fiscal matters and featured candidates U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, businessman Donald Trump and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.
The panelists discussed their predictions for the third debate.
“The fury in the Republican Party comes from the sense that government isn’t working,” Schoen said. “If you look at the CBS-New York Times poll that was released yesterday, you will see that the Republican electorate feels this anger that is so palpable towards Washington and Congressional leadership.”
Shrum noted how the party has not united behind a candidate.
“Here’s a provocative thought — this might be the first time in a long time we’ll see something of a stalemate in the Republican Party,” Shrum said.
Prior to the debate, Shrum said the focus of the night might be on Carson and Trump.
“What happens with Carson and Trump tonight, that’s the whole ball game,” he said.
Schoen agreed but warned that though these candidates are currently in the spotlight, they are far from safe.
“There is a supposition that maybe Trump, Carson and Fiorina, who make up around 50 percent of the primaries vote might fade away, and maybe they will,” he said.
During the breaks, Schnur moderated a student panel featuring Daily Trojan news editor Anshu Siripurapu and USC College Republicans Vice President Leesa Danzek.
Candidate attacks were flying across the auditorium at the University of Colorado Boulder, where the debate was hosted, but more so between the candidates and moderators than between the candidates themselves, Siripurapu said.
“If I were to publish a story about this debate, the headline would be, ‘Candidates spar with moderators at Republican debate,’” he said.  “In this debate, there has been less fighting between candidates and more direct [engagement with] the moderators.”
Danzek said Rubio had a strong performance in the debate.
“If I had to pick a headline, it would be ‘Rubio Rises,’” Danzek said. “Among [Republican] millennials, Marco Rubio is an outstanding candidate. I think that he handled himself well tonight, and he [will jump] in the polls.”

The University Web Registration system will not be available to students until Monday, Nov. 2, according to an email sent by University Registrar Frank Chang early Wednesday morning. Both the new and old systems of enrollment will be offline, but Chang reported that the problem is not related to the new registration system, which was released on Oct. 21.
The problem mainly affects upperclassmen, who were previously scheduled for academic advisement appointments starting Sept. 28 and ending Nov. 3. Freshmen will be unaffected by the problem, continuing with their appointments on the previously scheduled dates of Nov. 6 through Nov. 17.
“I didn’t really care because it doesn’t affect me since,” said Shreya Anand, a freshman majoring in non-governmental organizations and social change. “I could see how [upperclassmen] would be mad or upset over it. Overall though, it’s not a big deal for [freshmen].”
Students will not be able to register or to alter their schedules for the spring 2016 semester. Appointments with advisors will be adjusted accordingly, and a schedule for appointment rescheduling was included in the email sent out by Chang early Wednesday morning. The time that the appointment was previously scheduled at will remain the same; the only thing that will change in the rescheduling will be the date.
“I’m surprised that something like this would happen at a University that is this large and this well-funded,” said Hannah Rule, a junior majoring in film and television production. “It seems unusual, but I’m not worried about it in the long run.”

The Undergraduate Student Government’s External Relations committee and Wellness Affairs committee hosted the “Voices of USC — The Mental Health Climate” event on campus Wednesday evening in the Trojan Conference room at the Engemann Student Health Center. Voices of USC is an open forum and safe space for students to discuss issues pertinent to them.
The evening’s event was in honor of Mental Health Awareness month at USC. The evening consisted of a thorough discussion of many topics pertaining to mental health and its stigma on our campus. The panel that led the discussion consisted of Diane Medsker, a health promotion specialist at the health center; Hannah Nguyen, director of the Academic Cultural Assembly; and Austin Churchill, assistant director of Wellness Affairs.
The panel opened the event by citing some mental health statistics. Nguyen informed the attendees of reports that 25 percent of all U.S. adults have a mental illness. Medsker then added that according to the American College Health Association, international students at USC identify stress and anxiety as the top two factors that most negatively and most frequently affect academic performance.
The panel then moved into the discussion portion of the event. To begin, they asked the audience to define mental health.
“When I think about mental health, I think it is really interesting that we separate it from physical health. It is always physical health and mental health,” one student said. “Often physical health can affect mental health, and mental health can affect physical health so easily.”
Following the initial question, the panel began to talk about the stigma of mental health both in general and on university campuses like USC. They also identified potential reasons for why the stigma exists. One attendee described her take on the environment at USC in terms of mental health.
“USC is a very competitive place inside and outside the classroom,” she said. “I think that people here connect having mental health issues with weakness and that a lot of people try to hide that so that they can appear to be doing well. I think that people force that happiness upon themselves on the outside even though it may not translate to what is on the inside.”
She went on to describe that even if people do choose to reach out for help, it is sometimes met with insincere promises of people who will “always be there if you need to reach out,” perhaps on social media or otherwise. To respond to such concerns, the panel described various resources available on campus to help treat mental health issues.
Kelly Greco, a staff psychologist on campus addressed this, citing her personal experiences with students.
“If you are feeling that you are not getting your needs met, what I always say to a student is to please call me back if you need any additional assistance,” Greco said. “I don’t think that students know that they can call me back directly. I am the point person now; you don’t need to go through this anymore in terms of calling the front desk and setting something up.”
Next, the counseling center staff opened up the floor to suggestions from students as to how to improve their practice. Together, attendees brainstormed ideas ranging from adding mental health education to freshmen orientation programming, adding a more diversified counseling staff to better understand marginalized groups, adding mental health surveys to other University data collection efforts in order to gain statistics on the student body and present it back to them, and utilizing Facebook events to remind students about upcoming mental health events on campus.
In her closing, Nguyen addressed the entire audience.
“Thank you to the students who shared their stories and perspectives on this issue. Thank you for being brave,” she said.  “Staff…I hope what you’ve learned from these students will help you go back and enact change. And to everyone, this isn’t the end or the last conversation. The conversation around this issue needs to continue. I urge you to keep voicing your opinions, to fight on and make mental health issues a priority for all students.”

When Peter Jung transferred to USC from the University of Illinois and met Jake Cho, they had no idea that the friendship would turn into a business partnership.
Jung, a senior majoring in international relations and global business, and Cho, a senior majoring in economics, are the co-founders of Quuve, a crowdsourced calendar system where people can easily update their calendar and share it with others.
Cho had the initial idea for the startup, which he formed while serving two years in the Korean military. When Cho met Jung, who works on operation and design for the startup, through their involvement in the Korean International Student Association, the idea quickly came to life for Quuve, a homonym for cube. Jung said he has always had a passion for entrepreneurship and realized that the best place for him to be was in Los Angeles, where the startup culture is quickly growing due to the influence of Silicon Valley.
“The KISA organization helps international students become acclimated to the school, and this leadership skillset pushed me to do something more, not just for KISA but for the whole USC community,” Jung said.
Collaborative websites like Reddit and Wikipedia all have a community of individuals with similar interests who share common objectives. The goal for Quuve is to create a comparable community within USC. Though friends or classmates have like objectives and dates, each person updates his or her calendar individually. Jung provides an example where a professor assigns a homework assignment to a class of 200 students. These 200 people then all proceed to do the exact same thing of writing it in their calendar. The point of Quuve is to allow simply one individual to mark this assignment and update it for the entire class.
“What we are trying to do is change the way groups communicate,” Jung said. “If you look at Google calendar, there is a way to share calendars with other people but that goes through an email notification. What we want to do is create a separate app just for crowdsourcing. I think that is what makes us different and unique because that is our minimum value and what we are going to focus on.”
Jung and Cho are working to create a mobile app and a web application for Quuve and anticipate having a Beta prototype by the spring semester. The greatest challenge so far has been building the app itself since neither Jung nor Cho are skilled in coding and computer science. During the summer, the team worked with a group of USC graduate students to create the app; however, they are now outsourcing the work to a different company. This comes with other risks since the Quuve members are not physically seeing the work being done and only communicate with the app creators online.
The biggest takeaway for Jung is to learn from failure, a concept that has helped him not only in this startup endeavor but in other applications of life as well.
“I am actually an introvert, so that sets me back from doing what I actually want to do. But through this, we initialized many things, executed many strategies and failed as well, and we learned from that,” Jung said. “Through this experience, I learned that if I want to do something, I should initialize it and learn through my failures.”
The long-term goals for Quuve differ slightly for the two founders. Cho hopes to have 20 percent of the USC undergraduate population using the app by the end of next semester. Jung will be happy with 10 percent engagement at that stage. Over the next two years, the team is focusing on gathering users, the most important aspect of any successful startup.
“We need to promote and show our value and then people need to realize this value, which will help gather other users,” Jung said.
Jung and Cho will launch the app at USC and then strive to expand to other college campuses on the West Coast and ultimately have a presence at colleges nationwide.

You and I collide · The Women of Troy’s upcoming pair of matches against Stanford and Cal will both carry Pac-12 title implications. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The women’s soccer team will hit the road to take on Stanford on Thursday before playing Cal on Sunday.
Stanford is currently ranked No. 4, boasting a 14-2 record and sitting atop the Pac-12. Like any quality side, the Cardinal will present USC with challenges. However, head coach Keidane McAlpine has led the Women of Troy to a 7-1 record in Pac-12 play and has his team playing free-flowing soccer.
Thursday’s clash could very well be the game of the season in the Pac-12.
Stanford has a plus-21 goal difference on the year, while USC is not far behind with an impressive plus-17 in that category. Stanford averages over 19 shots per game. USC tallies nearly 18 per game.
In other words, Thursday’s fixture should see plenty of offense.
College soccer fans probably think of U.S. Women’s national team stars such as Julie Foudy, Kelley O’Hara and Christen Press when they think of this Stanford program.
Like USC, Stanford has a proud tradition and history. In fact, Stanford and USC have each won a national championship in the past decade — Stanford in 2011 and USC in 2007.
When these two giants collide on Thursday, there will be serious ramifications on the national landscape. The Women of Troy have climbed to No. 16 in the NSCAA rankings and are gelling at the perfect time. If USC can steal a road win against this top-five team, a spot in the top-10 would not be out of the question.
However, the quality of the performance against Stanford will be just as important as the result of the game. Even after two wins this past weekend, McAlpine stressed that the team must continue to grow game by game.
“We’ve got to keep building from where we are,” McAlpine said.
USC did not look like its dynamic self against Utah last Friday but then on Sunday dismantled a strong Colorado team. McAlpine will be looking for a well-rounded showing against Stanford because the postseason is rapidly approaching.
Playing well in these games down the stretch is a necessity in many ways, as teams who enter the NCAA Tournament in good form stand a better chance of taking home the hardware.
The Women of Troy will then face Cal on Sunday. Cal is another top-20 team enjoying a fine season.
The Golden Bears are led by junior forward sensation Arielle Ship. Ship has found the back of the net 11 times this season while also recording five assists.
Ship is scoring nearly two goals every three games for the Golden Bears. She is one of the most potent attacking threats in the country and figures to test USC’s back line.
Cal had a few hiccups early in Pac-12 play, but the team really hit its stride in October. The Golden Bears have won six out of eight this month and are fresh off of a 1-0 road win over Washington State.
“We’ve given ourselves a chance,” McAlpine said, referring to how well his team has performed so far.
USC hosted the Cardinal and the Golden Bears last season, losing 1-0 and 2-1, respectively.

As the final seconds ticked off the clock in USC’s surprise victory over No. 3 Utah, the aura of the Coliseum felt different than in week’s past.
The stadium was still full, besides the small section of Utah fans that abandoned their seats early and still rocking as Cameron Smith led the band, somewhat nervously, after his breakout performance.
The Coliseum torch burned strongly into the night, maybe signaling a sign of hope for this Trojan season. As it stands, the Trojans are just one loss back of a Pac-12 South title, holding the tie-breaker over Utah and Arizona State.
After a month highlighted by more downs than ups, the Trojans got back to their winning ways with a 42-24 whooping of No. 3 Utah.  For the first time in the post-Sarkisian era, the Trojans came off the field as victors, a hopeful signal that this talented squad has left the drama of the past month in the past.
These athletes, especially the seniors, have endured more change than any program over the past four years. In fact, this year’s seniors have played for four different head coaches — Kiffin, Ogeron, Sarkisian and Helton.
Despite all the drama that has surrounded the Trojan program over the past few years, the team has responded exceptionally well. In 2013, the Trojans responded to Kiffin’s firing by ending the season 7-2, including a standout win over No. 4 Stanford at the Coliseum.
The Trojans battled hard and lost at Notre Dame last week and then returned home to defeat the Utes — an identical situation to the 2013 squad. That win over Utah in late October sparked a five-game win streak that thrust the Trojans back into the Top 25.
While this season may be lost in terms of making the College Football Playoff, the team still has a lot to play for. The Trojans, after all, control their own destiny should the Utes lose one more game to the likes of either Washington, Arizona or UCLA.
This Trojan team has all the talent to compete with the best of the best.
After all, the Trojans were 6.5 point favorites over the No. 3 Utes despite being at 3-3 on the year. Even more, when the Trojans were up big on the Utes, I know I wasn’t the only person who wasn’t surprised.
In fact, I felt that the Trojans should win that game with ease. Utah is great and all, but they  field nowhere near the same talent level as the Trojans. Their big wins came over Michigan in their first game and at Oregon —  a vastly overrated team as we’ve seen with its subsequent loss to Washington State.
USC doesn’t lose to schools like Utah. Now it’s time for the Trojans to reassert themselves with the Pac-12 elite and finish the season strong.
The way the Trojans’ schedule lines up won’t be easy, but with the likes of JuJu Smith-Schuster, Adoree’ Jackson, and Ronald Jones II on our side, I’ll take us as favorites in every game.
This week’s game features a harder than usual matchup against in-state rivals, the Cal Golden Bears. The Trojans haven’t lost to the Bears since 2003, and if they can contain the Golden Bears’ Jared Goff at least somewhat, they should come out victorious with ease.
Following the Weekender, the Trojans will return home for a homecoming matchup against the Arizona Wildcats.
The Wildcats have little resemblance to their 2014 counterpart, which surprised everyone and represented the Pac-12 South in the championship game.
Should the Trojans win both of those games they will sit at 6-3 on the year with a good shot at making the conference championship. The back end of the schedule will prove to be the most daunting part of the Trojans’ season.
The Trojans will have to play back-to-back road games against Colorado and Oregon. While both of these games might not look intimidating at first sight, especially with Oregon’s early season trouble, playing on the road is always tricky, especially in cold weather stadiums. The Trojans will need to show a lot of resilience in order to come out as victors.
If the Trojans can escape from Boulder and Eugene victorious, that would put them at 8-3 on the year and would set up a crucial matchup against cross-town rivals UCLA.
The Trojans have lost three straight to the Bruins, getting outscored 111-62. It’s time to put that to an end.
A strong finish to the season will set up the next coach nicely in terms of recruiting. Now it’s time for Kessler and co. to go out play like we know they can.
The Trojans can still salvage their season. After all, we don’t give up. We fight on — we’re Trojans.

Head down, man down · Freshman running back Ronald Jones II currently leads all Trojan rushers with 466 yards this season. His four touchdowns on the ground share the team lead, along with redshirt senior Tre Madden. – Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
It was another strong, physical and competitive practice for the Trojans. Interim head coach Clay Helton kept the team’s emphasis on the basics.
“I think these techniques and fundamentals are really paying off,” Helton said. “It’ll be critical in this game.”
Defensive line coach Chris Wilson also emphasized technique with his players. Looking to Cal, the Trojans will need to be able to shut down quarterback Jared Goff. Wilson noted that Goff is “the best” in college football.
“[Goff is] accurate. He’s smooth in the pocket,” Wilson said. “He can make every throw … He’s what you look for.”
With the strong performance from the defense against Utah, Wilson said he was impressed with the continually strong play from the freshmen.
“They’re fun, they’re talented, they like to play,” Wilson said. “They really want to be really good football players.”
Specifically, freshman inside linebacker Cameron Smith boasted three interceptions and a team-high nine tackles. Though Smith was dominant, he hasn’t let his strong performance have an effect on his practice. His main focus is on the team’s play as a whole.
“I want to be there for my teammates,” Smith said. “And help my team as much as possible.”
Smith is also looking to continue to improve his game.
“I’m trying to learn as much as possible,” Smith said. “And to make the plays when they’re there.”
Not only do the Trojans have freshmen starters, but they also have much-needed depth. This depth has been especially beneficial with the injuries over the last couple of games. Helton mentioned that red shirt wide receivers Steven Mitchell Jr. and Darreus Rogers have both started playing a bit more. Left tackle Chad Wheeler was practicing and will be good to go for Saturday.
With the freshman starters, the Trojans have added versatility on the field.
“I think our youth and talent is what shines so brightly here at ‘SC,” Helton said. “I think there’s a tremendous future for this University.”
Freshman cornerback Iman Marshall had two pass interference calls against Utah, but Helton isn’t worried because Marshall is an aggressive player. Helton even pointed out that Marshall is turning into a “premier corner.”
“He’s so big and strong, he’s an absolute weapon,” Helton said. “I don’t want to take that part of the game away from him.”
On the offense, Helton will look for tailback Ronald Jones II to get more snaps on the ball because of his continued performances. Not only has Jones been successful on the field, but he also has been putting in hard work and time during practice to become a more complete player.
“As you produce, your role increases,” Helton said. “That’s just the nature of football.”
Against Cal, defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox wants to see the team remain consistent. Against Notre Dame, the defense missed some coverage assignments, but they made adjustments and limited those mistakes against Utah. Wilcox credits the improvements to mental intensity, focus and consistent performances.
“We just need to be more consistent overall,” Wilcox said.
To beat Cal, the Trojans will have to shut down Goff and Cal’s running game.
“As an offense, they’re extremely explosive,” Wilcox said. “It’ll be a great challenge for us.”
Helton spent time working with the offensive line during practice. As the son of an offensive line coach, Helton knows the importance of having a strong line.
“I just want them to feel the intensity and passion that I have for that group,” Helton said. “For us to win the championship, it’s going to be won in the trenches.”
Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster has continued to be a strong point for the Trojans’ offense.
“[Smith-Schuster] reminds me so much of the great ones that have been here,” Helton said.
Helton pointed out that Smith-Schuster is always competing like it’s a game. Helton talked about how he’s always playing at his top gear.
“It’s his nature,” Helton said. “He only knows one speed, God bless him.”
For the Trojans to beat Cal, they will need to stay focused on their fundamentals and carry their dominant momentum from the Utah game.

Much has been said about the relationship between quarterbacks and their wide receivers. Uniquely, the friendship redshirt freshman Jalen Greene  has with USC quarterbacks Cody Kessler  and Max Browne stems from the one thing they all have in common —playing quarterback. And that has made all the difference.
“Cody’s really been great to me since I got here,” Greene said after practice Tuesday. “Our lockers are right next to each other, and I talk to him a lot. I can talk to him about anything and ask him about anything. He’s been a great older brother.”
Greene converted to playing receiver at USC in response to all of the injuries at the position. But before then, Greene had always played quarterback.
Additionally, Greene said he hadn’t played receiver since Pop Warner but admitted that all his time as quarterback has caused him to develop a distinctive feel for what his QBs wants him to do.
“Playing quarterback helps me a lot, but it kind of bites me in the foot in practice sometimes because I understand what Cody is looking at, and I can see the zone,” Greene said. “So, sometimes I might overrun a route because I know he isn’t looking where he should be looking. At the same time, it really helps us out being on the same page because I am seeing the defense the same way he is.”
The left-handed Greene graduated early and enrolled at USC in the spring of 2014. As a senior quarterback at Serra High School, Greene completed 134-of-229 passes for 1,544 yards with 33 TDs and six interceptions in 2013.  Though Greene has played receiver all season, he threw his first touchdown on a 75-yard TD pass to JuJu Smith-Schuster on a trick play where he was lined up as a receiver.
Greene added a few key catches that game and responded with two receptions in his first start of the season at wide receiver in USC’s huge win over No. 3 Utah.
“It’s really fun seeing him. I mean he came in here as a quarterback, and I was working with him every day,” Browne said. “Now, watching him be a receiver and doing good things and making huge catches out there has been awesome. I think a guy like him, who works so hard, has developed every week. And it has been really huge for us.”
Yesterday, interim head coach Clay Helton said the main reason why Cal’s Jared Goff is so successful is because of his “extraordinary” relationship with his longtime receiving corps that allow him to anticipate exactly where they are going to be, and what they are going to be doing. Similarly,   Greene said the connection he’s made with his QBs has resulted in his own success.
“I think that I’m definitely improving a lot because I’m adjusting every game,” Greene said. “Just knowing how to see the game as a receiver. Just understanding how to fit in certain zones or get to certain blocks easier, or just running my routes quicker, and learning the things to get separations from my guy. That’s been huge.”
Wide receivers coach Tee Martin, who coached Randall Cobb, a wideout who also converted from quarterback to receiver at the University of Kentucky in 2011, compared Greene’s ability to the now Packer’s Pro Bowl receiver.  He said that as quarterbacks, both players have a better understanding of the formations and schemes of the defense.
“Jalen is supremely intelligent. He is a lot like Randall Cobb,” Martin said.  “So, we try to use all of those talents. He’s thrown the ball a couple of times this year, and he has shined as a receiver.”
Martin said that the thing that has surprised him the most about Greene’s transition is just how physical he’s played this season —even as a quarterback. Martin additionally praised Greene’s improvement in his blocking and creation of separation from cornerbacks with his body.
“The good thing about Jalen that shocked me is how physical he plays,” Martin said. “You would think that a guy playing quarterback, not saying that quarterbacks aren’t tough, might be soft. But he is playing really physical now. And as a wide receiver, that’s good to see.”
While Greene largely played quarterback at Serra, he also ran for 1,209 yards on 155 carries with 14 TDs. Serra was 13-1 in 2013 and advanced to the CIF Western Division title game. Greene’s dynamic play making resulted in him making the 2013 Prep Star All-West, Cal-Hi Sports All-State second team, Max Preps All-State Division II first team and All-CIF Western Division.
Greene’s ability to utilize his speed to avoid defenders has certainly been applied by USC coaches.
“I think why they put him at receiver in the first place was because he is just so athletic,” said senior wide receiver George Katrib, who has been a mentor for Greene since he switched to the position. “You’ve seen how athletic he is in the pass catching game with the plays he’s made these past couple games.”
Katrib says that Greene is fitting in seemingly with the other receivers at this point in the season. And, that Greene’s commitment to hard work and the success of the team would cause him to excel at any position USC coaches decide to put him at next season — whether it’s at  receiver or quarterback.
Helton, who was coincidentally Greene’s quarterback coach when he arrived at USC, said that he will not make a decision on the redshirt freshman’s future position until the season is over.
Greene said has helped him grow both as a man and a football player, but added that  he will keep passing and working extremely hard until next spring so that he can eventually play quarterback again.
“I love Coach Helton. He helped me out a lot and really taught me things about the defense that got me smarter and raised my football IQ,” Greene said. “He’s a tremendous coach. The whole team has rallied around him, and I hope we are able to keep him.”
Greene added that he hasn’t talked about playing quarterback with any coaches yet because he is solely dedicated to his role as a receiver.
Greene’s play-making ability at the wide receiver position similarly impressed USC legend Keyshawn Johnson, who watched USC’s practice from the sideline Wednesday.
“From what I’ve seen here, and in the games, he really looks good and its been impressive to see him make the transition to playing receiver,” Johnson said. “I think that over time he’s going to continue to get better. I think that being a quarterback will help him understand how to run routes precisely, how he needs to come back on certain routes and intricacies like that.”

Tight jeans, side-swept bangs and bad middle school memories might be what first comes to mind when pop-punk band Fall Out Boy is mentioned, but the four-piece band has never seen itself as stereotypically emo. From collaborations with Big Sean, a tour with Wiz Khalifa  and music video appearances by 2 Chainz, the members of Fall Out Boy have proved themselves to be out of the box. Their relationship with the hip-hop genre continues Oct. 30 with the release of Make America Psycho Again, a remix album of their most recent album American Beauty/American Psycho.
The original album was released in January of this year and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 200. Now, the band has announced a remix album that features today’s most popular rappers. The album has the same exact track list as American Beauty/American Psycho, but each song features one rapper. The artists featured on the new album are Migos, A$AP Ferg, Juicy J, Azealia Banks, Wiz Khalifa, Big K.R.I.T., UZI, OG Maco, I LOVE MAKONNEN, Black Thought and Joey Bada$$. So far, four of the re-releases have been made available, “Irresistible
(feat. Migos),” “The Kids Aren’t Alright (feat. Azealia Banks),” “Uma Thurman (feat. Wiz Khalifa)” and “American Beauty/American Psycho (feat. A$AP Ferg).”
“Irresistible (feat. Migos)” replaces the typically early 2000s alternative rock sound of the band with a modern trap beat. Azealia Banks gives “The Kids Aren’t Alright” a slowed down, consistent beat that adds a childhood nostalgia with a sense of restlessness. Banks raps about her lover, which flows perfectly into lead singer Patrick Stump’s original lyrics. “Uma Thurman” is perhaps the best song of the tracks, possibly because Khalifa and the band have worked together so often. Khalifa stays true to the rock influence on the song while adding his own flair to create a party-perfect hit for fans of both genres. A$AP Ferg makes “American Beauty/American Psycho” his own in the remix. He fluidly transforms the song into a track that could have appeared on his own album with no question. Laced in the song is Stump singing the hook of the smooth rap track. He name-drops Nicki Minaj, rhymes with pelican and somehow makes the Beach Boys-like harmony of the original song seem cohesive.
The album is not a case of one artist becoming the other. Fall Out Boy doesn’t cross over to hip-hop, and none of the rappers trade over their skills for rock; rather, a new and interesting hybrid is created. The unique sound that Make America Psycho Again establishes promises to have mainstream success. Stump’s vocals are taken out of their natural environment and made more powerful by the more simplistic beats. The rap verses are made even more evocative when backed by a rock-like rhythm. Together, the artists lead a movement against genre division that will hopefully begin a revolution.

Eat well, be well · Sharon Palmer advocates plant-based diets for health, personal and environmental reasons. Palmer attended a faculty master dinner on Tuesday and the Trojan Farmer’s Market on Wednesday. – Photo courtesy of Sharon Palmer
In the midst of USC’s Health and Wellness Week, a week promoting sustainable, healthy living and bringing awareness to mental health issues, some might realize that it’s time to make a lifestyle change. However, changing a habit or lifestyle can be an overwhelming and daunting process. Though becoming vegetarian is a choice that is becoming more common and well-received, those who wish to pursue this path — whether it’s for health or personal reasons — often don’t know where to start.
In nutritionist, writer and blogger Sharon Palmer’s newest book, Plant-Powered for Life, Palmer creates a guide for healthy eating that is fun and accessible for everyone. Her book is a combination of cookbook and handbook, providing an interactive yet informative approach to a plant-based diet. Palmer believes that the journey to becoming a vegan or a vegetarian can be achieved through step-by-step practice and the right amount of assistance. Palmer is a registered dietitian and an award-winning journalist with 16 years of health care experience under her belt. Passionate about food, the environment and sustainability, Palmer hopes to pursue a plant-based diet by giving talks around the globe. She recently spoke at Café 84 for a faculty master dinner about
Plant-Powered for Life. During the dinner, Palmer spoke to the Daily Trojan about the importance of plant-based living.
Daily Trojan: What inspired you do the plant-based diet and write this book?
Sharon Palmer: For most of my life, my family and I were either vegetarian or semi-vegetarian. Even when I was semi-vegetarian, I was never really a huge fan of meat. In college, I attended and studied nutrition at Loma Linda University, which was a non-meat campus. I wanted to write this book because it was something I wanted to do and the environment and animal welfare is something that I am passionate about.
DT: In recent years, there seems to be an ongoing trend of becoming vegan or vegetarian. Especially in Los Angeles, many celebrities are glamorizing it with their juicing sets, obsession with kale and all things organic. What do you think of this trend? Do you think that this trend is helping or hurting the movement?
SP: I think that the trend definitely helps in bringing awareness to the plant-based movement. It’s good that celebrities are getting into this lifestyle because it influences people to learn more about it and try it too. Though there might be misinformation, they might be telling people different aspects of the diet that may not be correct, the whole Hollywood thing is helping to support the plant-based movement. The fact that it is a  trend created a perfect timing and an extra push for me to advocate for the
plant-based diet, since people are more open and accepting to the idea of it. If it was not a trend, I would still do it anyway. I would still be writing and giving talks about it because this is something that I’m passionate about.
DT: In your talk, you said the number one reason people switch to the plant-based diet is for health. The number two and three reasons are animals and the environment. Which of the three was the biggest factor for you?
SP: First reason was health and then it was close to animals. [The documentary] Food Inc. really influenced me. It really made me think about animals. I think that I was oblivious to how animals were being treated. It made the animal part very important. The difference between vegetarian and vegan is the animal part.
DT: Have you thought about going into another field?
SP: I thought about going back to school to further my knowledge on nutrition or going into Environmental Science, but I am too busy. I currently run my
blog, speak all across the United States, do consulting and am on the Nutrition Advisory Committee. Going back to school is something that I always thought about doing but don’t think I have time for.
DT: Do you think the plant-based diet is more female dominated? Do you think that there’s a stigma for men being vegetarian or vegan with being too feminine that would drive them to not pursue it?
SP: Yes, I do think that there is this whole meat thing where guys think they need to eat meat to be tough.  Surprisingly, there isn’t a huge difference when you look at the numbers. I always try to get people, even my own friends, to embrace the idea regardless of gender.
DT: What are your thoughts on people who want to start the plant-based lifestyle but can’t seem to give up meat?
SP: I think it’s a personal choice. I would not want to make people feel guilty if they don’t do it.  If you want to do it, then do it. I do want everybody to pursue a
plant-based diet, but I am not militant about it. For me, you don’t have to give it up — just cut back. Cutting back even a little bit can make a huge difference.
DT: What are some ideas to motivate people to start a plant-based diet?
SP: Start with small steps like Meatless Monday. Some people are more gradual and are not ready to say never ever. It’s like smoking. If it is somebody’s behavior and health, it’s even bigger. A consistent
plant-based eater is proven to live longer than those who aren’t. A
plant-powered lifestyle is not about being boring. There are 40,000 species of plants and thousands of varieties. There’s such a diverse array of plants and many ways to incorporate them into your diet and your life.

A week after the last week of classes, I have reached a point where I have lived in Melbourne for so long that life back in sunny Los Angeles seems foreign. I have grown accustomed to looking the wrong way for cars coming down the road, counting my coins to pay four Australian dollars for laundry and going from stall to stall in the mornings to pick up groceries at Queen Victoria Market. While on the phone with my mom walking back to my apartment from school, she asked where I was going. My instant response was, “I’m going home.” Acclimation took some time, but now I think I have reached a point where the experience has felt less like an extended trip to a new country and more like a move to a new home.
Through its eccentricities and novelties, Melbourne has delivered as the most livable city, a title it was given by The Economist. Though the weather here has been far from perfect, and I remain indisposed at the thought of my tram ticket, I still believe the months I have spent here thus far have exposed me to a lifestyle that at first seemed alien.
I have had almost too much time to learn the ins and outs of the city. I can recite the streets in tandem throughout the central business district and point out where great sandwich joints, coffee shops and stores sit. I have a gym routine, surprisingly, and probably one with the least amount of money I will ever spend going to the gym. L.A., on the other hand, is full of expensive workout crazes to which I have effectively sold my soul. When I travel on the weekends around Australia, I get excited to return to my bed in Melbourne. Though the people I have met are hard to part with, the amount of comfort offered in the city will make me miss Melbourne almost as much. The laid-back and carefree nature of Australian culture stands in opposition to my usual on-edge personality; my excitement to constantly be doing something and inability to sit still is an anomaly in Aussie life.
This at-ease nature presents itself in a variety of situations. The other day, a block away from my building, the police apprehended a man bearing a meat cleaver in the street. The area was immediately quarantined, but the police response departed from what the response would have been should the same episode have occurred in America. Instead of using force to subdue the man, the officers waited for the situation to calm down. While this instance marked the success of a non-violent police force, I shudder to think if other examples would have had a similar result. I’m comforted by the fact that crime rates here are relatively low.
I’ve also noticed that Australians are notorious for their abbreviations. In fact, if the word is longer than four letters, the Australians have probably come up with an abbreviation for it. At this point I am waiting for my name to be abbreviated. Friends have joked about just how extensive the list gets; little did I know that the humor reflects reality. Several store clerks or baristas address customers with, “How you doing s’arvo?” The translation is, “How are you doing this afternoon?” believe it or not. Abbreviations also apply to food including “spag bol” for spaghetti bolognese, “breky” for breakfast and more. I have picked up a couple here and there, but hopefully when I leave this habit stays behind.
I noticed several of my other habits have changed to match Aussie lifestyle. At home, I am accustomed to getting the majority of my work done at night time, and my favorite place to study is coffee shops around town. Eateries, especially cafes, here are notorious for closing early, with the latest closing at 5 p.m. Though the coffee is incredible, it is unfortunately only available at 7-Eleven after that time. I have flipped my schedule, frequenting places earlier in the day to get work done, and have found places to visit regularly.
In these next weeks of studying for exams, I’ve come to realize just how difficult it will be to part from my lifestyle here. It is difficult to balance missing my actual home with fearing just how much I’ll miss my Australian home. I struggle to even talk about the idea of returning to Los Angeles, but it comes closer each week. In anticipation, I plan to spend my final weeks abroad enjoying as much as I can of Melbourne.

Cultural sensitivity is not exactly America’s strong suit. It’s ironic, maybe, that the developed nation with arguably the most cultural and ethnic diversity is so consistently deferential only to the whims of one racial group. On occasions like Halloween, the social construction of white dominance is often happily exhibited. Ethnically based costumes like “Native American girl,” “Oriental Woman” and “Arab Man” sell at almost any age group — and are found to be disturbingly popular among children under 12. While maintaining almost no veritable aspect of the culture from which these costumes profess to draw, culturally based ensembles do more than remind us of the ethnic hierarchy which so many Americans have spent their lives trying to combat. They reinforce the trivialization of exceedingly marginalized groups. A child might wear the “Native American girl” costume for a night, but her Cherokee, Navajo or Choctaw neighbors and their children must bear the social consequences for the rest of their lives — the dehumanizing and demoralizing message that their culture is not worth the respect or reverence of their peers. Their entire familial heritage becomes a joke. No amount of “fun” can counterbalance that effect. This is not the manner in which any parent should allow their children to celebrate.
So it is only with the greatest amount of sensitivity and courage that Berkeley’s Rosa Parks Elementary School issued a notice to parents last week that ethnically or racially motivated costumes would not be tolerated on school grounds. The school informed its community that these costumes may make members of these cultures and ethnicities feel “unsafe and/or disrespected.” The school, as well as its community, should be proud of this measure. It not only represents its commitment to maintaining the physical and emotional well-being of all students, but also indicates a step in the right direction — a much-needed advancement toward an American observation of the country’s wonderfully diverse heritage.
It is important to note that Rosa Parks Elementary School explicitly stated that costumes fashioned after specific members of ethnicities are still entirely acceptable. Dressing up as a specific character, position or historical figure is not a form of racist mimicry. When children trick-or-treat as Aladdin and Princess Tiana, they are understanding that person as a person — not as the blank face of some misunderstood “exotic” ethnicity. There is a very large, very important difference between the Chinese warrior Mulan and “Oriental Woman Costume” — and the elementary school does a commendable job of taking this into account.
Despite personal feelings on the nature of microaggression or subconscious racism, Halloween participants everywhere — including here at USC — should deeply consider how they approach an understanding of different cultures and subgroups. Eradicating these costumes is also a measure to protect the self-perception and self-esteem of students of color. A black student with dreadlocks should not have to watch his hairstyle become part of a joke when his white classmate adds “Rastafarian wig” to his Halloween repertoire. A Sikh student does not deserve to see his or her culture devalued by a mislabeled and ignorant “Arab Man” getup. By wearing ethnically motivated costumes, students unintentionally perpetuate the invisibility and otherness that people of color are consistently made to feel. The Chicano/a poncho is not a costume. The dashiki is not a costume. The hijab is not a costume. These are pieces of long-lasting, vibrant cultures that deserve respect.
Students of color already have to operate biculturally, constantly walking the line between the culture of white social dominance and whitewashing while also attempting to remain observant of their cultural roots. Students at USC and beyond should keep in mind the way they choose to approach issues of race and their own privilege — our collective goal should be to further the inclusion of non-white cultures in the American canon of respected and revered traditions. Rosa Parks Elementary School was absolutely right to exercise administrative discretion in the protection of students of color. Schools across the nation should follow suit — and with the holiday fast approaching, we should all take heed.
this is kind of a misleading title. Berkeley implies UC Berkeley, not some elementary school.  Also banning speech is never the best way to deal with offensive speech.   While there are many offensive costumes out there, it is a better policy to educate someone on why it’s offensive to wear a native american headdress, rather than ban it.

When I was in high school, my guilty pleasure was attending concerts. I had two best friends who were always on board and ready with tickets to come with me to the menagerie of venues. I had probably been to every venue in my hometown of Phoenix more than twice and was always willing to go see any artist that came, even if I didn’t know much of their music.  I have to say, a little ashamedly that the best concert I ever went to was when Macklemore and Ryan Lewis performed at Club Red in Tempe my junior year in October 2012.
I know that today, Macklemore is considered a slight cliché, a kind of rap-pop sellout who, unfortunately, has become more of a joke among young people than an artist. I still stand by my previous statement though. For starters, I had never been to this venue, an unusual thing for me. It was this tiny little hole-in-the-wall venue, pitch-black with some aggressive red neon lights backlighting the bar. I attended this concert with a large group of guy friends, the same people who just days earlier had made me listen to his new song, “Same Love.” Granted, this concert happened before he became famous for radio and media coverage around his supportive LGBT anthem.
You could tell he wasn’t quite a pop star yet because this venue honestly couldn’t have held more than 100 people, all of which were crammed against my back at the front of the stage. Despite the fact that I was being stepped on by my overzealous friends in the crowd, it was the most fun and musical experience I have ever had.
There’s just something about a group of people experiencing something together in an intimate setting, discovering something that they hold secret that creates a unique musical bond between concertgoers. The fact that we were a small privileged group who knew about this young, diverse and controversial artist before anyone else did tied us together in a way that I definitely haven’t experienced since.
Macklemore and Lewis themselves were an overall joy to see. Their lyrics had dark and light stories behind them that painted an oddly true picture of humanity all the while Macklemore crowd surfed over us. Before they were cliché, before “Thrift Shop” was more known for its parodies than the original, these artists represented a small group of talented individuals who were incredibly passionate and excited about their future. They performed for the love of the music, for the excitement of having a crowd respond to their lyrics. They were interactive. Simply watching them made us all excited.
Though Macklemore and Lewis aren’t viewed as the most valuable artists on the scene today, it always puts a smile on my face when I remember that ecstatic, intimate experience with them when they had been but fresh new artists, full of hope for the future of their careers.

Sweet concoction: Cotton Candy Frappucino is on the list!
With only about six weeks left (seriously, how fast has time flown though?!) before classes officially end on Dec. 4, things have been getting extra busy; coursework has been piling up, midterms are in full force and thousand-word documents have been typed up on our laptops. Many of us have probably been pulling all-nighters to finish up our essays and studying for our midterms.
With all this work piling up, coffee has probably become a staple for you – I know it’s been for me. If you’re bored with the same old caramel macchiato and skinny vanilla latte that you’ve been ordering every day, read on! I’ve compiled a list of the best Starbucks “secret” recipes from their secret menu to give you a sugar boost and keep you energized!
This frappucino doesn’t contain caffeine, but it will surely fulfill your sweet craving and keep you energized as you prepare for your midterms or write your essay. Simply order a tall Vanilla Bean Frappucino and add one pump of raspberry syrup (one-and-a-half pumps for a grande and two pumps for Venti). Not only is this simple drink a pretty pale pink color, each sip tastes like a mouthful of cotton candy.
Ever wondered what Butterbeer from Harry Potter’s Leaky Cauldron taste like? Lucky for you, Starbucks can make a latte that tastes just like it! With the weather cooling down and winter quickly approaching, this steaming hot latte will be the perfect option for a cold night in the library. To try this recipe, order a whole milk steamer, add caramel syrup, toffee nut syrup and cinnamon dolce syrup (add two pumps of each type of syrup for a tall, three for grande and four for venti). Finish the latte with whipped cream to get a nice creamy texture and taste. To help keep you awake in the library, you can also add a shot of espresso (two for grande or venti), but this will add more of a coffee flavor to your Butterbeer.
Another hot option is the warm sugar cookie hot chocolate. Start with a White Mocha Hot Chocolate and add hazelnut syrup and vanilla syrup (one pump of each syrup for tall, two for grande and three for venti). When you receive your order, head over to the condiment bar and sprinkle some raw sugar on top to give it that extra oomph! If you prefer your beverage less sweet, you can alter the recipe by reducing each pump of syrup by half.
Fall season means the return of the famous Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte. Though the Pumpkin Spice Latte is already amazing as is, this simple recipe adds a nutty flavor to the latte and is perfect for October. Don’t just carve your pumpkins, drink them! To try this recipe, order a Pumpkin Spice Latte to start and then add toffee nut syrup (one pump for tall, one-and-a-half for grande and two for venti) and vanilla syrup (one pump for tall and grande, one-and-a-half pumps for venti).
For all Matcha lovers, this Green Tea Kit Kat Frappucino is for you! Designed to resemble the taste of those delicious little Green Tea Kit Kats, this Frappucino will definitely fulfill your Matcha craving. Start with a Matcha green tea Frappucino and then add white mocha syrup (one pump for tall, one-and-a-half for grande and two for venti). You can also substitute soymilk for an extra kick of sweetness and add some java chips for a chocolate-y crunch.
If you loved snacking on Teddy Grahams as a kid, you will love this Teddy Grahams Frappucino. This Frappucino is reminiscent of the honey and graham cracker taste of Teddy Grahams and will transport you to your childhood. It also has caffeine and will help keep you awake and alert. Start with a coffee frappucino, add cinnamon dolce syrup (one pump for tall, two for grande, three for venti), vanilla syrup (half a pump for tall, one for grande, one-and-a-half for venti) and honey.
Who doesn’t love Nutella? This espresso drink will not only keep your tummy warm and happy, it will be your fuel as you write that 4,000 word essay. Start with a Café Misto, add mocha and hazelnut syrup (add half a pump of each syrup for tall, one for grande and one-and-a-half for venti) and ask for a caramel drizzle on top!
Celebrate your birthday (or any day, really) with Starbucks delicious Cake Batter Frappucino! This simple Frappucino is frothy, sweet and icy—perfect for keeping you refreshed! Start with a Vanilla Bean Frappucino and then simply add hazelnut syrup (one pump for tall, one-and-a-half for grande and two for venti). To transform your Cake Batter Frappucino into a Birthday Cake Frappucino, ask your barista to blend a Starbucks cake pop into your drink. Note that not all Starbucks locations will agree to do this, but some will.
So, go ahead and make your way down this list! Or find some of your own favorite secret Starbucks recipes from this website. The two convenient Starbucks locations — on campus at Trojan Grounds next to Leavey Library and off campus on Figueroa and Exposition  — will help you on your quest.

On Tuesday, the Undergraduate Student Government Senate decided to postpone the vote on the Campus Climate Resolution for two weeks. This is a major disappointment.
Words can only go so far: This campus needs action. It is therefore disheartening to see the USG Senate delay the vote and extend the discussion. Trojans have been having this discussion for years, if not longer.
The resolution the Senate debated for hours last night is a non-binding call for the USC administration to make substantive policy changes, including hiring new administrators and giving scholarships to minority candidates. USG is not empowered to control University funding or policy in these areas and force through changes; instead, the best USG can do is pass a non-binding resolution recommending these policy changes.
The Senate was arguing last night about simply asking for a new policy. That discussion is many steps removed from actually changing this campus.
No wonder USC students are frustrated.
Delaying this vote for two weeks softens the voice with which USG is speaking to the administration. As a previous Daily Trojan Opinion piece pointed out, there are three ways to change behavior: carrots, sticks and sermons, and sermons are the least effective way to create change. A resolution from the USG Senate calling for change is a sermon, and a resolution delayed by another two weeks after a full month of discussion is a weak sermon.
This sermon from USG only becomes weaker as the weeks pass. As USG President Rini Sampath, who co-authored the resolution and was vocally upset with the delay, wrote in a letter to the Daily Trojan on Sept. 28, “News cycles will pass, but prejudice does not.” Indeed, no major news outlet has written about diversity on our campus for weeks. As USC international relations professors frequently say in their classes, that kind of publicity galvanizes action.
Evidence does not suggest that the administration was going to make any policy changes before this latest discriminatory incident. Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry stated in an interview with ATVN that he had been talking to black men, international students and student-athletes on campus, and that they all told him they were having trouble fitting in. Yet, the administration did not announce any plans to change anything until after the incident. Indeed, in an interview with the Washington Post, Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni said that USC “want[s] to create a dialogue,” rather than adopting the kinds of sticks-and-carrots approaches that will incite change on campus.
USC is certainly getting the dialogue the administration promised. Between the diversity forum on Sept. 30 with hundreds of students in attendance, the debate on the Senate floor Tuesday night, the administration’s rollout of the #TogetherUSC campaign Tuesday morning, Provost Michael Quick’s call on Wednesday for student input, the stories in campus news media and the posts on social media, USC is talking. But enough with the dialogue.
Shockingly, some USG senators still question the need for USG to act on this core issue. Residential Senator Giuseppe Robalino stated on the floor that students should stand up for themselves in class against professors who do not teach diverse theories in class. Robalino is missing the point of these discussions that Trojans are having once again: The system itself is inherently biased. A biased system as large as the University of Southern California has significantly more power than any individual student. The only way for student voices to be heard is to rally together and encourage duly elected representatives, like Sen. Robalino, to act on their behalf.
If Robalino believes that students should stand up for themselves instead of appealing to their representatives, then he should resign as USG Senator, because there is no reason to even have a Senate. If Robalino believes the Senate should not act on issues as fundamental as diversity and human rights on campus, then he is not qualified to do his job. Robalino should resign and save USC students the money we otherwise pay him in stipends.
Last night the Senate could not pass a non-binding resolution encouraging the administration to stop discrimination on campus. Our message grows weaker by the day.

Yasmine Kahsai | Daily Trojan
After a Cal State Fullerton associate math professor was recently chastised by university officials for assigning a cheaper textbook than the one mandated by the department chair — which was also conveniently written by the department chair — the debate regarding textbook prices and other associated costs of college and what actions universities can take to alleviate them has been reignited. While the debate may seem to encapsulate a very small portion of what makes college expensive, the sources of the problem reflect a greater structural flaw in America’s higher education.
While the cost of tuition itself is an issue, the real problem with the cost of higher education stems from a lack of market competition. The government may try and step up to cover the growing costs of and associated with college, but if those costs are exacerbated by the choices of universities, professors and even legislators themselves, then we would be better served by targeting the problem at its sources. In multiple aspects of higher education, companies and universities conspire to drive out market capitalism in favor of crafting powerful and magnificently inefficient oligopolies which inevitably become monopolies.
However, no aspect of higher education shows the absolute failure of the education industry’s ability or willingness to embrace market competition more than the textbook industry.
The textbook industry is considered a broken market because the product is chosen by either a university or a professor, while the consumer is the student. Knowing that the demand for textbooks is essentially inelastic or unresponsive to price changes because textbooks are mandatory for most classes, textbook publishers can mark up prices far past the point of a reasonable profit margin. In a normal market, this could be combatted by competition with other producers; however, the number of textbook publishers has dwindled down into single digits, allowing them to collude to keep prices high. Professor Mark J. Perry of the University of Michigan argues that the rampant collusion has created a textbook “bubble,” similar to the housing bubble and dot-com bubble.
The interplay of school boards, universities and textbook publishers continually fails to take into account consumer preference and ability to pay. This lack of competition is the very antithesis of capitalism as it fails to respond to the laws of supply and demand. Textbooks are not an isolated incident of a corrupted market in the education industry; they are simply a microcosm reflecting a greater problem.
For example, the act of simply getting into college has been structurally designed to quash competition and, thus, supplier responsiveness to consumer preference. The largest — and one of the only — suppliers of college entrance exams, College Board, was not a firm that entered a market and had to prove its products’ efficacies to various universities. Instead, it was created as a product of 12 universities trying to make a standardized test. And though this seemed practical at the time, today Advanced Placement exams cost nearly $100 each and the SAT exam costs over $50. The SAT’s only other competitor, the ACT, acts with College Board to collude in a duopoly, which keeps prices high and responsiveness to consumer satisfaction low.
Since either the SAT or the ACT is a requirement for applying to most nationally ranked universities, our generation has directly felt the price of universities choosing shortcuts over effectiveness and efficiency.
However, as the world becomes increasingly paperless and market barriers to entrance gradually dwindle, empirical evidence dictates that there may be hope after all, but only if universities start taking  note of consumer — in this case, student — preference. Students across the country begrudgingly use Blackboard Learn to access course materials, assignments and grades. Complaining about Blackboard is so common that it has become cliché. Yet in 2006, Blackboard had 90 percent of the market share. Luckily, the tech market has far fewer barriers to entry, especially considering that there are no government standards to pander to when creating a website for hosting course content. After a recent insurgence of competitors, many universities listened to the complaints of students and professors alike and adopted new learning management systems. EdSurge reports Blackboard’s market share as of March of this year as 44 percent. Hopefully this success story indicates that change can be made in even the most antiquated and broken markets.
The cost of college is not just about tuition. It includes entrance exams, textbooks and materials needed to succeed in the classroom as well as the software included as part of tuition. If we really want to talk about doing what is best for students, we must recognize that there is currently an absence of consumer choice and voice, so professors and universities must make choices to reflect the preferences and maximize the well-being of students.

When I think of dangling modifiers. I think of a mountain climber on a cliff. His gloved hands grasp loosely on the crude rocks above him. His feet keep him hoisted and stable. But only for now. At any moment, any slip of the hand or cracking rock could send him plummeting down into the foggy oblivion below. 
That’s what dangling modifiers do to a sentence. They put into question the rigidity and soundness of the rest of the sentence. Sentences like “Hungry, the leftover pizza was devoured,” or “Rummaging in her giant handbag, the sunglasses escaped detection” give the average joe quick laughs and a grammatician nightmares.  
The phrases “hungry” or “rummaging in her giant handbag” do not describe clearly defined subjects. Who was hungry? Who was rummaging in her giant handbag? Answering these questions is the first step toward fixing dangling modifiers and the first step toward not falling off the mountain cliff.
But it’s obvious, some say. No one is actually going to think that the pizza was hungry or that the sunglasses rummaged. So why fix it? Why not leave it and call it “style”? 
Those who believe that grammar restricts stylistic creativity are missing the point. Many view grammar as structures that people must navigate around, things that narrow the possible courses of action. But a more accurate depiction is grammar as the foundation to a building. The foundation is necessary for strength, but whatever is above the building can be as creative as desired. 
Fixing dangling modifiers is important because it puts the subject back at the helm of a sentence. Imagine a ship without a captain, the White House without the president and The Beatles without John Lennon. Without them, the whole becomes less of what it once was, having lost an integral part of itself. 
Indeed, grammar wasn’t created to limit style. It was created so that style itself could be more clear and understandable.

With the increase in unemployment, there has been a growing lack of job opportunities in the city of Los Angeles, specifically for low-income, undocumented residents. With fewer opportunities to earn an honest living, low-income undocumented residents significantly depend on street vending to provide for their families. Street vending is an integral part of the city’s culture and economy; however, government agencies continue to enforce anti-street vending laws throughout Los Angeles.
Though street vendors can currently purchase a health and business permit, undocumented vendors still run the risk of getting cited, arrested and possibly deported. I strongly believe that a comprehensive and collaborative policy legalizing street vending would benefit the city because vendors significantly contribute taxes to the economy, while street vendors will in turn benefit from being allowed to financially provide for their families. Thus, an implementation of a city-wide comprehensive policy is important not only to legalize street vending and to help end the criminalization of this form of business, but also to allow the city to continue benefiting from this economic development strategy.
The tax revenue being generated from street vending can help create financial security for the city and can help alleviate the unemployment rate. Yvonne Yen Liu, Patrick Burns and Daniel Flaming (2015), in the study of Sidewalk Stimulus from the Economic Roundtable, state that the Los Angeles Bureau of Street Services estimates “50,000 street microbusinesses operate in the city annually.” Additionally, “street vending is a $504 million industry in Los Angeles.” As street vendors sell their products, they add demand for services or supplies they purchase from local suppliers, which consequently generates tax revenues for local, state and the federal government. Hence, a policy legalizing street vending in Los Angeles would not only benefit the estimated 50,000 vendors, but also the entire city through an increase in tax revenue.
Small business owners argue that street vending is an unfair business since vendors are not required to pay property taxes. Through a comprehensive policy, the needs of small business owners, vendors and the city can be met. As long as vendors respect small businesses and vice versa, both parties can highly benefit from the legalization of vending on sidewalks.
Undocumented vendors depend on this source of income from selling food and other products on the streets to financially provide for their families. If there continues to be a lack of policy legalizing street vending, innocent individuals will continuously be criminalized and possibly be deported. Families of vendors facing deportation will be separated and children will suffer the consequences mainly.
Throughout my experience in the social work field, I have learned and witnessed that children who grow up without proper nurture from their loved ones will face future negative consequences. These consequences come from a disrupted relationship with their loved ones that will cause children to grow up without proper care and guidance. This lack of care can lead many children to engage in negative habits, such as drug abuse and criminal behavior.
In order to prevent our children from engaging in these negative habits, the necessary action needs to be made. Hence, government officials should officially allow vendors to financially provide for their families rather than separate them. As individuals, we all search for community now as it helps shape who we are as human beings. Therefore, arresting and deporting street vendors will threaten the community we could potentially build if government officials enact a legalization policy of street vending. Furthermore, the city of Los Angeles cannot afford to let the economic development strategy pass us by. Finally, government officials need to act now and allow the city of Los Angeles to benefit from the $504 million industry of street vending and the tax revenue it generates.

Witty. Introspective. Moving. Laugh-out-loud funny. The Daily Trojan Blogs are all these things and more, a hybrid of web and log, a form that takes the diary and all its personal, retrospective aspects and meshes it with public immediacy to make an outlet of expression that’s not quite like anything else.
Here, we don’t need to do last-minute cuts for space. In this virtual space of everything but the kitchen sink, it’s more free-form. More spontaneous. More organic. More alive. Now, one semester and two-thirds later, I’ve come to value this evolving literary form more than ever before.
When we first launched Blogs in Spring 2015, it immediately became a natural extension of the paper, something that you look back on and ask yourself why you hadn’t thought of it before. It became a place that captured the experiences of students traversing the world, tracked the everyday college student’s trains of thought, shared recipes concocted on the fly.
Very quickly, I realized this was markedly different from the stories that run in print, particularly in terms of enabling writers to express themselves in ways that more traditional long-form couldn’t. We used to have an opinion blog, Viewpoints, that I envisioned would be a breath of fresh air from the more formal style of editorial. It would be more conversational, less timely in the news it highlighted, and yet, in a sense, more timeless. One writer dedicated an ode to the beauty of Yik Yak, while another sent in a powerful piece responding to critics of First Lady Michelle Obama’s appearance at BET’s “Black Girls Rock” special event. The sky’s the limit.
It’s stretched the bounds of creativity, and created a springboard for engaging blog ideas. This semester, things have blossomed. As my co-editor, Emily, and I mentioned at the beginning of the semester in this post, we’ve unraveled four new blogs — Behind the Desk, SC Style, Commas Saves Lives and Trojan Tunes — in addition to continuing with the DeeTs, Troy Meets World, DT Photo Blog, Trojan Timeout and SCrumptious.
But, on top of all that, more has launched into motion. We’ve debuted a weekly advice column, Ask Tiffany, where Tiffany Kuan follows up students’ queries with words of wisdom. For Trojan Tunes, we’ve been looking to start up a Q & A series that’ll give artists on campus the spotlight they deserve. Just this Monday, our new blog series, Love U, went live. Inspired by Modern Love of The New York Times and L.A. Affairs from the Los Angeles Times, Love U runs reader-submitted love stories. The entire newsroom has been head over heels with excitement. It’s the teamwork, from our forty writers to the managing editors, that makes these crazy-great ideas possible. It’s the community built around this blog section, the enthusiasm from our writers and the dedication of our editors that make each post blog-worthy.
The initiative that our bloggers show constitutes nothing short of inspiring. My former editorial columnist, Athanasius Georgy, stepped up to the plate and embodied the meaning of initiative, setting up interviews on his own with notable entrepreneurs and brilliant visionaries such as USC alum, Rick Caruso, and Urth Caffé cofounder, Shallom Berkman. Last semester, Food for Thought columnist Natalie Laczewski churned out recipes and reviews that were such a pleasure to read. When I told her all her posts have been a joy, she said she loved writing for Blogs and joked that if she could, she’d become a full-time blogger.
Bloggers this semester have continued that tradition. #JackieLikesJava columnist Jackie Mayuga approached me with her own idea of setting off on an L.A. coffee shop tour. Following suit, Paulina Ordaz initiated her own series of visits to donut shops around the city, her adventures documented in her biweekly column, Donut Worry, Be Happy. David Wang, a photographer last semester, pushed for a music blog, now brought into reality as Trojan Tunes.
Blogs has now stepped over and become more than just a publication. It’s a broadcast that lives and feeds on the enthusiasm of the bloggers that make up the heart of it. It’s a messy but beautiful compilation that captures campus life as it is in the here and now. It’s writing out loud. 
Valerie Yu is a senior majoring in English and biological sciences. She is also blogs editor of the Daily Trojan.

“We want the vote! We want the vote!” chanted a large number of students and visitors present at last night’s Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting some minutes after Sen. Darian Nourian, who is also sports editor of the Daily Trojan, presented a motion to postpone the vote for the campus climate resolution, which eventually passed with a majority vote.
The move came after a long and heated discussion in front of a packed room in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, one that lasted an hour and half past the usual Senate meeting end time. Walls in the back of the room had to be moved to make more space for the dozens of students who crowded the floor. A student carried a sign that said: “This is silly & you should feel silly.” Others had signs with the hashtag: “#diSCriminationliveshere.”
During the meeting, the senate and members of the audience debated postponing of the resolution, the resolution itself and the amendments to the resolution.
One of the amendments that generated the most discussion dealt with university courses’ curricula, which, according to the resolution’s authors, should incorporate diversity, inclusion and equity components.

Supporters of the amendment argued that the subject matter of their courses is written, in its majority, by “old, white males” and not the minorities often explored and taught in these subjects. Opponents of the amendment argued that course material should be determined by professors and that students are free to voice objections during class.
Giuseppe Robalino, residential senator, was one of the first to oppose the amendment.
“Take charge of your own learning, raise your hand, speak up,” Robalino said. “To what degree are we asking the hand of legislation to take the place of the empowerment coming from within the students?”
Sampath, one of the amendment’s and the resolution’s key authors, responded.
“Giuseppe, how does a room full of almost a hundred students not speak to you to the point that students are here speaking up? I don’t understand,” Sampath said. “It is 7:56 p.m., and students are still here because their voices aren’t being heard in classrooms … And the reason why you and these other senators have a job is because these students are showing up and putting a resolution on the table.”

Another amendment that proved polemic dealt with the establishment and use of the proposed $100 million fund to support underrepresented students and tenured faculty positions for underrepresented minorities.
Sen. Jacob Ellenhorn was one of the first to criticize the amendment, arguing that it would make tuition increase.
“I rise in strong opposition [to] this resolution,” Ellenhorn said. “USG, at the beginning of this year, set a standard for what they hoped to accomplish at the end of the school year. And that was focusing on tuition hikes and tuition increases that we all experience … This bill is not clear as to where the funding for all these extra administrators will come from.”

Sampath responded, arguing that USC has no shortage of funds and the issue is allocation of spending.
“We feel that there is a lack of prioritization in where the money is going right now,” Sampath said. “We all know that there is a $650 million University Village being built right now … there’s going to be a Trader Joe’s, a Sprinkles Cupcakes and a Target… Frankly, we don’t need another Sprinkles Cupcakes when we’re pretty salty.”
The final section of the extended meeting involved a discussion on the prolonging of the resolution vote.
Sampath mentioned that this decision, if passed, would be in keeping with the administration’s indifference to previous USC initiatives.
“This is not about conversations anymore — it is about action. Pushing this two weeks out makes zero sense when we’re talking about the advocacy work and voices of thousands of students on our campus,” Sampath said. “I don’t see how this is going to solve anything when it further perpetuates cyclical advocacy work with absolutely no answers.”

Robalino argued that he could not vote on the newly amended resolution, as he had not had enough time to examine on it.
“I have had class today, I am sure all the other senators have had class today. So what we owe to the student body is to make sure that this is written well, so we can push forward with the goal,” Robalino said. “I understand that a lot of people have labored a lot of time, and effort, and blood and tears, and we are doing [this] out of respect for them.”
The resolution, presented a week ago, became a unifying issue for many student assemblies, which mobilized students to attend last night’s meeting. The Senate will vote on the resolution in two weeks with no further chance of extension. The resolution has already been passed by the Graduate Student Government and the Faculty Senate.

When Sampath is denied admittance to the USC Law school………………….who will she blame?
Sooooo, how are these dumb liberals planning on incorporating “diversity” in chemistry, engineering, mathematics, and physics classrooms? What a load of garbage.
As a student of Viterbi School of Engineering, it is ridiculous to have such a low representation of diversity amongst our students and faculty. These “dumb liberals” are proposing a resolution to change the academic atmosphere for our brilliant and ambitious students who would like to learn and grow from other perspectives besides a male’s perspective or a caucasian perspective. That’s how diversity bleeds into chemistry, engineering, mathematics, and physics classrooms. It is not merely talking about diversity but have diversity seen across all fronts and all majors. For once, step into the shoes of someone who is not you and move with the future. The Graduate Student Government has and so has our Faculty Senate. Now its USG’s turn.
Seems like you’re a pretty active commenter on DT. Why don’t you put a name and picture to stand by your words?
ConcernedTrojan:
This point was raised in the meeting. As the writers and supporters of the agreement stated, this course requirement will not affect courses such as chemistry, physics, mathematics (i.e purely scientific courses). The section of the resolution you are referring to is for Arts & Humanities type courses, where much of the course is focused on cultural issues. My understanding is that the issue that these students take with the current state of affairs in these classes is that they feel issues that affect all or many different communities are being dealt with and discussed from a very narrow point of view (that being the point of view of a white male). Again, this would not affect purely scientific courses.
I do think that there are many points in this resolution that could stand to be clarified and rewritten, however calling these people “dumb liberals” because you weren’t at the meeting and therefore don’t have all the information, is not in any way helpful.

Rally on · Janitors, faculty and students demonstrate in Hahn Plaza Tuesday to urge USC to support janitors during their contract negotiations. – Beverly Pham | Daily Trojan
“Si, se puede!” was the rallying cry once again at Tuesday’s Justice for Janitors demonstration, which brought USC service workers, students and faculty together to demand higher wages and better health benefits for janitors on campus. More than 100 protesters gathered on Trousdale Parkway before circling campus and assembling in front of Bovard Auditorium to address President C. L. Max Nikias and present their demands to administrators.
The rally was led by the Service Employees International Union United Service Workers West and supported by the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation. The protests took place ahead of the final round of negotiations between USC service workers and their employer, Aramark, an independent contractor that the University hires to provide janitors and other service staff.
Since their labor contract expired on June 30, labor union representatives from SEIU have been locked in negotiations with Aramark, a process that Edmundo Garcia, the lead contract enforcement specialist for the USC janitors’ USWW chapter, believes is essential for creating fair wages and working conditions. In addition to today’s rally, demonstrations were held on Sept. 4 and Sept. 9. According to Garcia, the protests are taking place at USC because of the unique influence that USC has over the negotiating process.
“We’ve invited USC to participate [in the negotiations] because we know that at the end of the day, they are Aramark’s client,” Garcia said. “They have the ability to push Aramark to make sure that the folks that are working at USC, and that very much feel part of the community, are going to be getting a fair contract.”
The current negotiations, according to Garcia, have settled on an agreement regarding working conditions — ensuring, among other requirements, that the workers’ labor contract complies with California’s 2014 Healthy Workplace Healthy Family Act — and will now be moving on to purely economic issues, such as workers’ wages and health benefits. Ultimately, Garcia and others want to ensure that newer workers are receiving a wage that they can live off of, while preventing the higher wages of older, more experienced workers from stagnating.
“We are looking to make sure that [workers] are getting wages that are fair compensation for the work that they’re doing at a prestigious university like USC, and that they’re going to be wages that folks can live on and use to provide opportunities for their families,” Garcia said. “We are not minimum wage workers — we bring a value to the University.”
Tuesday’s rally brought together not only service workers and SEIU employees, but also involved students and faculty members in the fight for better wages and benefits. Brianna Davidson, a first-year graduate student in the School of Social Work, attended the rally to show support for the workers that she believes deserve a fair contract.
“It’s a part of our nature as social workers,” Davidson said. “We’re here to support the community and something that’s important.”
Noura Wedell, a lecturer of critical studies at the Roski School of Art and Design, spoke at the demonstration as well, letting workers know that the USC faculty understood and supported their efforts at negotiation. According to Wedell, some faculty are underpaid as well and hope that by making a difference in the wages of the service workers, they too can see results from the University.
“I’m in solidarity with [service workers] because that’s the way that our strength in numbers works,” Wedell said. “We have power together in order to sway the administration, but I also think that there’s just a lesson of solidarity that is the same lesson that I try to teach my students in education.”
Depending on the outcome of the ongoing negotiations, which will be concluded on Wednesday, workers will be taking a vote on Friday to decide whether or not to go on strike. While event organizers, such as SEIU Internal Organizer Luis Fuentes, stressed that “no one wants a strike,” they also acknowledged that workers will take whatever steps they believe are necessary for USC to put pressure on Aramark to meet their demands.
“We want to make sure that the workers here at Aramark and at USC don’t have to raise a family on poverty wages,” Fuentes said. “It’s not fair. We think that the largest private employer in the city of Los Angeles can do better for its workers.”

In an effort to increase the number of minority storytellers in the entertainment industry, USC announced yesterday that the George Lucas Family Foundation will apportion $10 million from a previous donation to fund the education and recruitment of black and Hispanic students.
“This gift will nurture the next generation of artists, supporting scholarships that enhance access in the cinematic arts, while bringing new and diverse voices and stories into our lives,” President C. L. Max Nikias told USC News.
This money is a portion of the George Lucas Family Foundation’s original 2006 pledge of $175 million to the School of Cinematic Arts. Of this amount, $75 million was used for the school’s reconstruction and renaming. This student support fund will be drawn from the remaining $100 million.
With this donation, the Star Wars creator and class of 1966 alumnus will establish the George Lucas Family Foundation Endowed Student Support Fund for Diversity. Specifically, the fund aims to give undergraduate and graduate black or Hispanic students priority consideration for the financial support it will provide.
His partner on the initiative is his wife, Mellody Hobson, Ariel Investments President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Dreamworks Animation. The fund’s support will be equally distributed among male and female students, who will be known as either George Lucas Scholars or Mellody Hobson Scholars.
In March 2014, Hobson gave a TED Talk on diversity in business and its positive societal and professional externalities. Nikias called Hobson and her husband “inspiring leaders in their fields.” Their gift contributes to USC’s campaign to raise $6 billion or more in private philanthropy.
