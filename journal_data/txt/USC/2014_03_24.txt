After a title-winning trip to Hawaii during the USC sand volleyball team’s spring break, the Women of Troy will look to continue their six game winning streak as they take on Pepperdine this today at 5 p.m. in Merle Norman Stadium.  
Last week in Honolulu, senior Kirby Burnham and freshman Sara Hughes won four matches at the Jack in the Box Rainbow Wahine Spring Challenge to take home the tournament title on a 21-18, 21-16 victory over host Hawai’i’s Karissa Cook and Brittany Tiegs at the Queen’s Beach Sandbox on Saturday, March 22.  
In Hawaii, the second-ranked USC women’s sand volleyball team (6-1) started off its trip in the right manner with a pair of victories at the Queen’s Beach Sandbox last Wednesday. The Women of Troy earned a 4-1 win over first-year program Arizona in their morning dual and then fought off third-ranked host Hawai’i for a 3-2 victory in the early afternoon.
After this victory, USC posted a 5-0 victory over No. 8 Nebraska to win its sixth straight dual match at the Queen’s Beach Sandbox. The Women of Troy won all five matches in straight sets and improved to 3-0 on its road trip to the islands.
Before this successful showdown, the Women of Troy defeated fourth-ranked Florida State in a dramatic 3-2 win. Freshman Kelly Claes and sophomore Alexa Strange came up big for the Women of Troy against FSU by taking out Julie Brown and Melanie Pavels.  This win tallied the USC’s first win over Florida State, which is a huge motivation heading in to the peak of the season.  
In today’s match, the Women of Troy will battle against No. 1 Pepperdine after taking a 5-0 loss to the Waves early in the season.  The Waves are undefeated this season and will be attempting to continue their impressive 41-1 all-time record when they make the trip to USC. 
Some of Pepperdine’s star players include Sophie Asprey and Victoria Adelhelm.  They are going to have to put up a tough match against Burnham and Hughes and the rest of the Women of Troy if they want to continue their winning traditions.  
Today’s matchup between the top two teams in the nation kicks off at 5 p.m. at USC’s Merle Norman Stadium.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Department of Public Safety crime/incident summary between Friday, March 21 and Saturday, March 22.
Crimes against a person
At 8:27 A.M. on March 21, a staff member reported a suspect grabbed her waist while she was exiting a Metro bus at Exposition Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. She pushed the suspect away and subsequently fled on foot. Because the staff member did not report the incident at the time, DPS could not search for the suspect.
At 8:39 A.M. on March 21, a staff member reported an unprovoked suspect punched him twice outside the Jefferson Street Metro station. The suspect fled the scene after a second staff member intervened. The incident was not reported at the time of occurrence, so DPS could not search for the suspect.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 9:01 a.m. on March 21,a staff member doing landscaping work outside the Hoffman Contracts Research Building discovered 22 butane canisters and a bag of marijuana. The property was given to DPS and took it to the Metropolitan Detention Center as evidence.

On Monday, the USC Shoah Foundation hosted a special presentation in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center by Douglas Greenberg about the “forgotten” Holocaust story of the providence of Wolyn, Poland.
History buff · Douglas Greenberg focused on Holocaust survivors in Poland. He credits his interest in this time period to his grandfather. – Kirstin Louie | Daily Trojan
The event focused on the story of the Jewish population of Wolyn during the Holocaust and how its story has been widely forgotten.
Greenberg is a current Rutgers University professor who served as executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation from 2000 to 2008. He returned to USC this year as an Institute Fellow to carry out research in USC’s Visual History Archive regarding the richly historic, yet often overlooked region of Wolyn.
“I feel that I gained a completely different perspective from the lecture,” said Jason Cheong, a sophomore majoring in history. “In class we’ve only been taking one approach to the history of the Holocaust, so it was interesting to learn this side too.”
In his presentation, Greenberg discussed how his personal interest in this field began with his own grandfather, who lived in the region of Wolyn. This personal connection, combined with Greenberg’s background in history, are both factors which sparked his curiosity in the Holocaust history of Wolyn.
His research seeks to reconstruct and shine a light on the experience of the Wolyn survivors. This task, however, is incredibly difficult due to the complex history of Wolyn, as well as the fact that only 1.5 percent of Jews in Wolyn communities survived the Holocaust.
“I think that I have uncovered an aspect of the Holocaust that is mostly unknown,” Greenberg said. “I hope that [attendees of the lecture] come away with an awareness that the Holocaust was not a simple event in history, and its complexity is important.”
Many of the students who attended were able to relate the lecture directly to their various classes, such as those in Jewish history courses and religious or conflict study classes.
“In my class, we’re examining different case studies and deciding whether or not religion is directly tied to violence,” said Natalie Tecimer, a junior majoring in international relations. “The Holocaust is clearly a prime example of this, and I feel like I gained a better understanding of my class and of the Holocaust itself by listening to this lecture.”
Greenberg discussed the specific nature of his work in the archives, as well. Over the years, he has devoted himself to research which relies on approximately 500 video interviews in the Shoah Foundation archive.
During the presentation, Greenberg played an archive segment of one of the Wolyn survivors detailing her experience in escaping Wolyn. The survivor touched on the fact that the horrific and unspeakable experiences that her loved ones faced are forgotten in history.
“Personally, it was my first time hearing about Wolyn,” said Rebecca Ahdoot, a sophomore majoring in public relations. “Seeing that video made me realize how much of a tragedy it is that those people’s lives and experiences are just forgotten.”
As Greenberg shared, 98.5 percent of Wolyn Jews were exterminated, leaving a very limited number of survivors to tell their story. Through his research in the archives, however, Greenberg hopes to raise not only awareness of the issue, but also tolerance and education of the complexity of this event.
“The speaker really brought to life the fact that those in Wolyn did not receive as much attention those murdered in the concentration camps,” said Emily Shemian, an undecided freshman. “Public memory needs to be amended and bring forth these truths that have been really held back.”
When asked about the most difficult part of his research, Greenberg noted that the subject is incredibly emotionally taxing.
“It is challenging to maintain composure and emotional distance [when watching the archives] for scholarly work, while simultaneously feeling such powerful emotion towards the subject,” Greenberg said. “However, I do feel that my research has made me a better human being.”

On Tuesday, USC became the first university in the United States to have a Burritobox available to its students on campus.

Advertised as “the World’s First Burrito Kiosk,” Burritobox is essentially a vending machine offering hot and fresh burritos. The kiosk will be located near the Parkside Apartments at 3730 S. McClintock Ave.
Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, said that Burritobox specifically reached out to the university to offer its services.
“Burritobox wanted us to be the first campus to offer their service to our students, [and] we also thought it was something cool, convenient and affordable that those on campus would enjoy,” Klinger said.
Klinger and his team visited the first Burritobox location at a gas station in West Hollywood to check out the kiosk and see what others thought of the product.
Patrons can order from Burritobox through an interactive touchscreen menu.  Customers can choose up to five different burrito options.
All burritos are refrigerated prior to the heating process and Burritobox employees service the machine daily to ensure  freshness. Additionally, they are made with                                                      hormone- and antibiotic-free ingredients. Excluding tax, the burritos cost $3 each. Guacamole can also be purchased for an additional 75 cents.
After making a selection, the screen displays the nutrition information to the customer and allows for payment processing. Once the payment has been processed, customers wait for the burrito to be heated up while a music video or video advertisement plays on screen for approximately 60 seconds.
Students on campus were excited to officially welcome Burritobox to campus.
“I think that [it] is always beneficial to add more food options on campus,” said Michael Wratschko II, a first-year graduate student studying business administration. “As soon as I saw the Burritobox concept I became excited. It’s like the Redbox for burritos.”
Kieryn Ziegler, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television, said that burritos were her favorite food, and she will be making an effort to try out the new kiosk.
“All food should be served in burrito form, but because burritos are the only food that’s ahead of the game, Burritobox’s addition to campus will be a positive step forward in burrito access for USC students,” Ziegler said.
Ray Hardjadinata, a graduate student studying business administration, noted that the addition will be beneficial when everything else on campus is closed.
“It will definitely be a positive addition on campus, especially early in the morning or late at night when other restaurants are closed or may require delivery minimums that are high,” Hardjadinata said. “I have a feeling this is more than just a fad, and we will start to see many more Burritobox locations pop up both on and off campus. I just hope the line doesn’t get too long.”
Kevin Brewer, head of Business Development at Burritobox, elaborated as to why USC was chosen to become the pilot school for Burritobox’s entrance onto university campuses.
“We started with our gas station pilot programs which have done great, and we are now rolling out to universities,” Brewer said. “We chose USC to be our first pilot college location for many reasons: The student body at USC is perfect for our target market, it’s a great community that USC has — the school is known for being a cutting-edge,  state-of-the-art campus that is always looking forward in terms of new ideas and services — it’s just a perfect fit for Burritobox.”
This will be the third Burritobox kiosk in the Southern California area, with future growth planned for both inside and outside of the United States, Brewer said.
He also mentioned that Burritobox will offer free burritos for 24 hours to students on the first day of its launch. Burritobox is anticipating hungry students who are eager to try its offerings of the “food of the future,” as Brewer described it.
If Burritobox sales are strong and demand is high from students, more kiosks may be planned for other locations on campus, Klinger said.

On March 14, USC announced that the Shinnyo-en Buddhist order donated $6.6 million to further the study of Japan and its culture at the university.
The Japanese Religions and Culture Center on campus will now be renamed the Shinso Ito Center. The name is meant to honor Her Holiness Shinso Ito, who is the current leader of the Shinnyo-en Buddhist order.
Duncan Williams, chair of the School of Religion at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and co-director of the Shinso Ito Center, elaborated on the generous gift.
“The donation will be used primarily as an endowment that will allow the Center to support its programs in perpetuity,” Williams said. “The center is the host of a variety of research projects that range from the study of pre-modern Japanese religion to contemporary immigration policies in Japan, from the connection between Japanese religions and science to the history of Japanese America.”
Based in Japan, the Shinnyo-en Buddhist order is an organization with nearly one million members worldwide. They have been involved in philanthropic efforts at American universities to help support Buddhist and Japanese studies.
Shinnyo-en has also made gifts to Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley. Williams previously served as the director of UC Berkeley’s Center for Japanese Studies before coming to USC in 2011.
“Shinnyo-en deeply appreciates the commitment of the USC Center for Japanese Religions and Culture for its deep and sensitive explorations of many aspects of Japanese culture through the study of international relations, society, the arts, media and religion,” said Rev. Minoru Shitara, director of the Shinnyo-en International Affairs Department. “Shinnyo-en views this support of the center as an expression of our common purpose with USC to educate people from diverse backgrounds to become effective agents for understanding, peace and harmony in the world.”
The Buddhist term shinnyo “denotes both Buddhahood (spiritual awakening) and the nature of reality; en refers to a boundless garden or open space,” according to the Shinnyo-en website.
The donation elicited a congratulatory statement from Caroline Kennedy, the current           U.S. Ambassador to Japan.
“Today’s historic gift of $6.6 million from the Shinnyo-en organization to the University of Southern California represents an important moment in the relationship between the United States and Japan. Promoting cross-cultural ties and mutual understanding between the U.S. and Japan is more important now than ever before,” Kennedy said in a statement.
The Shinso Ito Center for Japanese Religions and Culture currently has a wide array of initiatives that focus on promoting the study of Japan both on and off campus.
“Beyond research projects and the associated conferences and workshops, the center hosts nearly one event a week dealing with some aspect or another of Japanese studies,” Williams said. “Further, the center supports faculty and student research on Japan, whether it be to travel to Japan or present research at national and international conferences.”
The donation advances USC’s $6 billion fundraising initiative, of which more than $3 billion has been raised so far.

Recent USC graduate Qiao Xing was among the 227 passengers and 12 crew members on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. The flight is presumed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean.

Xing, also known as Joy, graduated from USC in December 2012 with a master’s degree in petroleum engineering.
Friends close to her said she had a unique perspective on life that lit up everyone around her.
“She was pretty optimistic and always looked on the bright side of life,” said Kaylee Yang, a friend of Xing’s and a senior majoring in environmental studies and business administration.
During Xing’s time at USC, she was an active member of campus religious life. At the beginning of her last semester in August 2012, Xing was baptized.
Yulin Billy Shen, another close friend and a USC graduate, said that Xing’s experience with God was “most important” to her during her time in the United States.
“The most important thing she [encountered] in the United States is that she knew God, which changed her life and her being a lot,” Shen said.
Xing would invite two friends to her apartment every Thursday to do Bible readings for an hour, said Yang, who attended the readings regularly.
Yang recalled that Xing enjoyed singing short hymns, such as Matthew 4:4 and 6:33.
“I remember her saying that she really got to know God during her time here at USC,” Yang said. “After the meeting with the Christian community here in Los Angeles, one of the Christians here introduced her to the church in China.”
After graduating from USC, Xing accepted a job as a reservoir engineer for Shell in Beijing and found time to meet with the same church in the city.
Keri Hui, another friend of Xing’s and a junior majoring in piano performance, said that Xing grew up during her time at USC and appreciated the help and support of the USC Christian community.
Xing also worked as a customer service representative for USC Housing and was a cashier at the USC Bookstore.
Shen noted that as a whole, Xing’s experience in the States was incredibly memorable.
“She was in the United States for only two years, but her experience was rich,” Shen said.
When Xing boarded Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370, she was on a business trip for Shell, Hui said.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Monday morning that new data and analysis by Inmarsat, a British satellite provider, and the British Air Accidents Investigation branch confirmed that flight MH370 is lost within a remote part of the Indian Ocean, according to The New York Times.
Prime Minister Najib said that based on pings received by the satellite, flight MH370 “ended up in the Southern Indian Ocean.”
Malaysia Airlines sent its condolences with a text message to the family members of the lost passengers and crew members Monday morning.
Friends of Xing said that despite their tragic loss, they are comforted knowing that Xing is with God.
“Regardless of the outcome, God really takes care of all his believers and I do believe she’s being taken care of,” Yang said.
When Hui thinks back to Xing at USC, all the memories she has of her lead to one common factor.
“She was very sweet to everyone,” said Hui. “I only remember that she always had a smile on her face.”
I am so sorry to hear of this loss to the world.  Sounds as if she was an inspiration not only in the business world but in being a soldier for the Lord.
If in fact all passengers have been taken in death, we are assured that Oaio Xing will be in Glory with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
Wonderful story.  Very inspiring.
Yulin Billy Shen is one of the elder brothers in my church

The first weekend of the NCAA Tournament is in the books, and for the third season in a row, USC was not a part of the action. The most exciting weekend on the sports calendar has been Trojan-less for my entire USC career, but that doesn’t mean that I’m always tuned out of college basketball during March. I’ve watched the tournament since I was a kid and still love getting caught up in all the buzzer-beating madness, even if it means watching in my living room with dozens of crumpled up brackets covering the floor.
Over my many years of watching the tournament, I’ve realized that the event is much more entertaining and engaging when 1) there are upsets, and 2) you know at least a little bit about the teams who are playing in the later rounds. Wichita State’s Final Four run last season was exciting, but if the Shockers and, say, Florida Gulf Coast made it all the way to the championship game, it wouldn’t necessarily have been must-watch television.
With those two principles in mind, I’ve found myself consistently rooting for Pac-12 schools (except for UCLA, of course) when USC doesn’t make the field. Pac-12 fans should root for other Pac-12 schools, while still acknowledging rivalry borders, because it makes the tournament more fun when you’re watching familiar players. It also boosts the conference’s national perception, which will pay off the next time your school is on the perilous “bubble” come Selection Sunday.
This season, the Pac-12 had six teams earn a bid in the tournament, and three of them — Arizona, UCLA and Stanford — are still alive heading into the Sweet 16. This level of success in March is something that the conference hasn’t experienced in more than a half-decade, during a time when the then-Pac-10 was considered by many to be among the best basketball conferences in the nation.
The Pac-10 had six teams in the tournament each season from 2007-2009, a stretch that was highlighted by two straight trips to the Final Four by UCLA in 2007 and 2008. Of the 12 Pac-10 teams that made the tournament in those two seasons, nine of them earned a No. 8 seed or better, and six of them made it to the Sweet 16. USC made the tournament each season from 2007-2009 and advanced to the Sweet 16 in 2007, where it lost to North Carolina.
The conference also boasted an impressive list of future NBA talent during these glory years. Seventeen Pac-10 players were taken in the first round of the NBA Draft from 2007-2009, including four former Trojans — Nick Young (drafted No. 16 in 2007), O.J. Mayo (No. 3 in 2008), DeMar DeRozan (No. 9 in 2009) and Taj Gibson (No. 26 in 2009). The 2008 draft was particularly heavy on Pac-10 players, with seven taken in the first round, three of whom were picked in the top five and six in the top 15.
Following the 2009 season, the Pac-10 entered a bit of a slump. With the previous two drafts robbing the conference of 12 underclassmen drafted in the first round, such a drop-off should have been expected but perhaps not to this degree. Only two Pac-10 schools made the tournament in 2010, with just one, Washington, advancing to the Sweet 16. Only one Pac-10 player, Washington’s Quincy Pondexter, was taken in the first round of the 2010 NBA Draft, and he wasn’t even selected until pick No. 26.
The 2011 tournament saw a rebound for the conference, and after a one-year postseason ban, a return trip for USC. The Pac-10 earned four bids that year, highlighted by a surprise run from Arizona. The Wildcats advanced to the Elite Eight, where they lost to eventual national champion Connecticut. USC lost in the first round to Virginia Commonwealth, who made it all the way to the Final Four.
Despite adding two teams to the conference in Utah and Colorado, the newly formed Pac-12 saw its number of bids cut in half from the previous season. Colorado lost in the Round of 32, and Cal, despite winning the regular season conference championship, earned a No. 12 seed and lost to South Florida in a First Four play-in game.
Last season was somewhat respectable for the Pac-12, with two teams, Arizona and Oregon, advancing to the Sweet 16. No team was seeded better than No. 6, and no team had a particularly impressive win.
This is not the case this season. Arizona enters the Sweet 16 as one of the favorites, with legitimate national championship goals and a relatively easy path to the Final Four. UCLA is as talented as any team left in the field and is on a roll after winning the Pac-12 Tournament. And Stanford surprised nearly everyone this past weekend, first by beating Mountain West champion New Mexico, then by knocking off a top-10 team in Kansas, which was led by this year’s potential No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft, Andrew Wiggins.
Stanford’s success should be encouraging for USC fans itching to return to the tournament. Both schools are prestigious academically, and neither have had a top-25 recruiting class in the past three years. Historically, the programs have been fairly similar as well. This is Stanford’s 17th NCAA tournament appearance, one more than USC’s 16. Each school has made two appearances in the Final Four, though USC’s most recent came in 1954 while Stanford’s was in 1998. The last time either team advanced to the Elite Eight was in 2001, and neither team has won a national championship since World War II (Stanford won in 1942, while USC has never won).
Yet here Stanford sits, in the Sweet 16 representing the now-reputable Pac-12, while USC has finished in last place twice in the last three years. With the Trojans still breaking in a new coaching staff, and with a top-25 recruiting class on the way, maybe the tide will turn in their favor quicker than most expect. Things can’t really get worse, right?
One thing is for certain: Should the Trojans be left out of the field next season, it won’t be a result of playing in a weak conference, because this season the Pac-12 has shown that it’s among the nation’s elite.

After a successful spring break spent in the South, USC’s fourth-ranked men’s tennis team returns home to host San Diego State today in its last nonconference match before beginning Pac-12 play.
Streaking · Junior Roberto Quiroz has won seven consecutive singles matches and has put together an 11-1 record in dual matches this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Last week, the Trojans took down Alabama, 5-0, and Ole Miss, 5-2, to improve to 17-2 on the season.
USC head coach Peter Smith was especially impressed with his team’s play against the Crimson Tide.
“I think when we played Alabama — in terms of effort and energy -— it was perfect,” Smith said.
Against Alabama and Ole Miss, Smith switched up the singles lineup, playing junior Yannick Hanfmann on court one, while senior captain Ray Sarmiento played on court two.
Sarmiento racked up two wins at the two-spot, but Hanfmann did not fare as well. The German suffered an upset at the hands of Ole Miss’ Nik Scholtz and his match against Alabama’s Daniil Proskura was suspended after Hanfmann dropped the first set, 7-5.
Smith acknowledged that the lineup change was unsuccessful at the top spot, but said he did it in order to maintain his team’s balance.
“I feel like for whatever reason, Ray has played more at one and I just want to give Yannick his reps there,” Smith said. “I want to have the balance to be able to play anybody anywhere, and Yannick needs to play more matches there.”
Smith said that he plans to put Sarmiento back in the top singles slot against the 8-8 Aztecs today, where he will likely face SDSU’s Thorsten Bertsch.
The Aztecs are unranked and has no players ranked in singles or doubles, but Sarmiento insists the Trojans won’t overlook their opponents.
“Our coaching staff does a great job of pushing us to keep getting better,” Sarmiento said. “No matter who we play there’s always a challenge to better ourselves as individuals and as a team.”
Sarmiento is currently riding a seven-match win streak in singles and sits at a career-high No. 3 in the national rankings released March 11. He and Hanfmann have  won 10 of 11 doubles matches together this season.
Junior Roberto Quiroz has matched Sarmiento’s recent success in singles, having also won seven straight. The Ecuador native was recently named Pac-12 Player of the Week for the second time this season.
“[Quiroz is] just bringing it and it’s really great to see him having more balance in his game, having more maturity in himself,” Smith said. “He’s really just handling himself. He’s grown up a year in two months.”
Today’s match will be the Trojans’ last nonconference matchup of the regular season, as they head to Oregon and Washington this weekend to begin Pac-12 play.
Smith says today’s match provides the perfect opportunity  to get back into the swing of things after having a few days off after the road trip and to prepare for the upcoming stretch of conference games.
“I did want to give the guys a spring break, but I also wanted them to have a little bit of cold water on the face — second day back from spring break, let’s play San Diego State,” Smith said. “We’ve got to get ready for the Pac-12 season and that’s what San Diego State’s here for.”
San Diego State comes into today’s match following a 4-2 win over Denver in the San Diego Invite. It was one of just two wins over nationally ranked opponents for the Aztecs all season.
The Trojans will take on the Aztecs today at Marks Stadium at 2 p.m.

While the rest of the USC student body relaxed and rejuvenated over spring break, the Trojan baseball team traveled to Oregon and Stanford to start off the Pac-12 conference slate. USC took last weekend’s series against the Cardinal, winning twice in three games to close out its road trip.
Catch a break · Freshman catcher/designated hitter Jeremy Martinez drove in the game-winning run against Stanford this weekend in a 10-inning effort. The newcomer is batting .284 for the Trojans this season. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
USC head coach Dan Hubbs was impressed with his team’s ability to beat the Cardinal.
“I thought we came up with some timely hits that led us to win on Friday and Sunday,” Hubbs said. “On Friday, Wyatt Strahan pitched extremely well and our relievers Kyle Davis and Kyle Twomey delivered big time on Sunday. Throughout the series, we really improved in running up the pitching count so the Cardinals’ bullpen had to come in, who we were then able to score runs against.”
Sunday proved to be the series’ most exciting game as the Trojans worked back from a three-run deficit within the first two innings of the game and managed to clinch the win with three runs during the top of the 10th inning after tying the game in the eighth.
Despite the successful comeback against the Cardinal, Hubbs believes that the Trojans must play more consistently and strategically during the beginning of games tonight and in the future.
“We need to do a better job moving forward of not giving up too many runs early so we don’t have to play from behind all the time,” Hubbs said. “That being said, I thought the guys really fought hard even though they struggled a little offensively and defensively. For us to play poorly like that and still come away with a series win on the road is a big step in the right direction for our program.”
The Trojans will face the Loyola Marymount Lions for the second time this season tonight at George C. Page Stadium.
During the last matchup, the Trojans ended the Lions’ seven-game winning streak in a 6-1 victory at home thanks to pitching efforts by sophomore Brent Wheatley and the four relief pitchers, as well as clutch hitting by junior infielder Dante Flores and junior catcher Garrett Stubbs.
In the two weeks since that game, LMU has created another winning streak, going 6-1 in series against Portland, Long Beach State and San Diego.
Despite the Lions’ recent successes, Hubbs feels that the Trojans can once again end their hot streak, provided that they play to their potential.
“To beat LMU again we basically just need to play well, which means getting a good start in terms of pitching, playing good defense and getting the bat rolling,” Hubbs said. “If we play decently like we did against Stanford last weekend, we probably won’t win, so the guys really need to step it up tomorrow.”
The numbers suggest that the Trojans and Lions will be evenly matched tonight, given that USC’s ERA is 3.16 compared to LMU’s 3.96 while LMU holds the advantage in team batting average with a .285 over USC’s .266.
In terms of securing a victory, Hubbs feels that the Trojans must improve their hitting consistency, which has struggled over the past two weeks.
“We haven’t been swinging the bat that great lately, so now we have to concentrate on making hits when it counts and advancing runners,” Hubbs said. “I think the guys have lost a bit of their confidence in terms of hitting recently, but they just need to not panic at the plate and realize they don’t need to hit a big double but rather string together a bunch of little hits to make runs.”
Sophomore Brent Wheatley will make the start on the mound for the Trojans tonight against the Lions at Page Stadium in Los Angeles at 6 p.m.

In college, drinking is rarely thought of as a productive way to spend time, as charity or as a positive contribution to society. But with the upcoming Tap, Cheer & Give Festival that will hit Santa Monica this Saturday, it is all of the above. At the festival, which is also open to those under 21, the best of locally-produced craft beer and music will be celebrated as innovative, cause-supporting brands that are making positive impacts on their community are simultaneously featured.
Beer we are now, entertain us · USC alumna Nicole Gordillo Schimpf has organized multiple brewery-centered events that blend the arts and giving back to the community, including BAM (pictured above). – Photos courtesy of Bernie Wire
Not only are the brands involved supporting various social causes, but when attendees purchase a ticket they also select a cause to which 10 percent of the proceeds from that ticket will go.
Though nearly all of the participants in the festival are local, founder and principal Nicole Gordillo Schimpf a USC alumna, said that she considered different factors when it came to selecting the breweries versus the brands involved.
“I really focused on trying to incorporate some well-known, Los Angeles-based craft breweries, along with some newer startup craft breweries,” Gordillo Schimpf said. “These are breweries that might not necessarily have a full-blown brewery, but they’re working at another location and they’re producing craft beer, but on a much smaller scale. I wanted it to be a blend of some of the big guys and some of the newer guys.”
When it came to the brands, Gordillo Schimpf said she sought a wide array of charitable causes that were being supported.
“I wanted to have the causes that those brands are supporting be diverse,” Gordillo Schimpf said. “Would-Works deals with homelessness, This Bar Saves Lives deals with malnutrition and hunger issues, Surfrider Foundation is more environmental and SOLO Eyewear provides eye care for people in need, so that’s more humanitarian.”
Gordillo Schimpf said she also wanted to ensure that the brands selected were able to create a product or market themselves in a way that was related to the general arts and culture environment of the festival.
“I wanted what they were selling to be something that would appeal to attendees as well,” Gordillo Schimpf said. “Solo Eye has some really funky, really cool bamboo glasses they sell, which I thought would be perfect. Omniscience Apparel sells really hip T-shirts with photos of different environments on them. Would-Works is creating a special bottle opener for the event. It’s an opportunity for those brands to gain exposure and to sell their products and grow their company and hopefully make more money for the causes that they support.”
For those less informed about the scientific process behind brewing craft beer, Tap, Cheer & Give will also offer short courses to provide some background for newcomers.
“Another really interesting feature that’s being highlighted at this event that makes it a little bit different is that we also are doing what is called crash courses,” Gordillo Schimpf said. “Those are short, 20-minute educational courses on everything from how to sample a beer, to how to properly order a craft beer, to how to brew a really great cup of coffee.”
In addition to having produced culture and artisan food and drink events for eight years, including events such as Pasadena’s Art Night, Gordillo Schimpf also curates the Beer, Arts, and Musical Festival, which is approaching its fifth year of operation.
“I produce many other festivals, one of them being BAM fest in October, which is an annual festival that has over 40 breweries … [BAM] is similar to Tap, Cheer & Give because it differs in that it incorporates craft breweries, but it also incorporates open artist studios and an open art gallery that people get to explore, as well as four live bands and DJs … The focus is really highlighting art.” Gordillo Schimpf said that because the festival has so much to offer in addition to serving alcohol, such as music, a photo booth and gourmet food trucks, these types of events attract attendees both young and old, creating both an open and diverse demographic.
“There are a lot of people who attend the event who are brewers or craft beer writers, so they’re experts in the field. But the atmosphere is really casual and fun, and people end up meeting and talking with each other, so it’s definitely for all ages, all walks of life and all levels of knowledge about beer.”
 
Tap, Cheer & Give will take place this Saturday, March 29 between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Tickets can be purchased through tapandcheer.com/spring-give.

It’s hard to talk seasons when discussing Southern California. After all, the running joke is that we only have one. But there’s something about spring here. The city feels like it was made for these months. There’s a certain buzz in the air. Spring is when everything comes alive here — especially the flowers.
Los Angeles County has some of the world’s most fertile soil. In the early 1900s, we held the distinction of being the No. 1 agricultural county in the entire nation. The flower district in Downtown Los Angeles today remains a strong echo of that agricultural past.
But much has changed since the Southern California Flower Market and the Original Los Angeles Flower Market opened their doors on Wall Street in the early 1900s to create the flower district in Los Angeles.
When the flower market first opened, it was teaming with local growers. Today, however, that’s not the case. Businesses businesses such as Muranaka Mums, Inc., run by third-generation growers and wholesalers Carolyn Toya and her brother Ron Muranaka, are now an endangered species.
Toya and Muranaka cut their flowers fresh each day and drive them downtown directly from their farm to the market, just as their grandfather did when he first immigrated to California from Japan in the early 1900s.
“He came as a houseboy and somewhere along the line he started to grow flowers,” Toya said. “He did it very simply. Then he used to come in and bring the product, like we still do, for whoever would buy it.”
The increasing price for resources, such as land, labor, water and energy, coupled with competition from cheaper importers, who can grow in countries with fewer regulations and more favorable growing conditions, caused many California growers to discontinue their businesses. Today, Muranaka Mums, Inc. supports 25 employees, many of whom live on its 12-acre farm, together with 22 greenhouses, which they have to heat in the winter and cool in the summer.
“We keep hanging in there, but it’s been tough,” Toya said. “It’s been tough for all the growers. The energy costs in California are tremendous. Some people actually don’t heat, but if you don’t heat, it takes a lot longer for the product to grow to harvest, so we do that.”
Paul Goldman of Allen’s Flower Market in Reseda, Calif., has a generational perspective on the flower district. He has been coming to the markets since he was a little boy. Flowers are in his family: Both of his brothers work in the business and his father was one of the first wholesalers to ship in bulk to supermarkets.
“As a kid, walking around with my dad, everyone knew each other,” Goldman said. “They’d curse and yell at each other and do their deals. It was really more of a fraternity. By six, seven in the morning, all the guys who worked there were getting ready to go to the racetrack. They were playing poker and gin rummy, and they were drunk. They were all drinking and carousing and playing dollar poker. The culture was a real good ol’ boy network.”
Today, much of that fraternity has faded away. The small local growers who traditionally sold their own product have been replaced by wholesale dealers who buy their flowers internationally. The opening of the market to the public in the 1990s has also caused many of the wholesale buyers to choose to buy their flowers directly from growers or importers.
Scott Yamabe, the general manager of the Southern California Flower Market, came to the market in the mid-1990s, when the district was already in transition.
“This place had it made back in the ’80s,” Yamabe said. “I mean the story had it that they put up ropes on all the entrances. At four o’clock, the bell would ring and the ropes would go down. This place would be jammed with [florists] and they would literally run in and try to buy flowers. By six o’clock, all the flowers on the floor would be gone.”
By the time Yamabe had entered the business, however, the district was making room for international business, from countries such as Mexico and Thailand.
“Up until the 1980s, the flowers in the U.S. that you saw were from California. It was that big of a business,” Yamabe said. “California still has a small grower population — you have some guys up in Santa Barbara, Ventura, the Oxnard area, some in San Diego, some up in Salinas, the Bay Area. But that’s pretty much it. The rest of them are importers. It’s really changed the business.”
Still, some traditions of the district have held on.
“Every Wednesday, my dad still comes down to the flower market, and I have breakfast with him and my brother,” Goldman said. “There’s still a few old-timers down there. One of them, this old Japanese guy, you always see him walking around the market and it looks like he’s drinking coffee, but it’s really whiskey.”
No longer will businesses like Muranaka Mums, Inc., however dominate the district. The floral business has changed and the clock can’t be turned back. Today, the future of the district’s traditions, set by its founding members almost a century ago, is uncertain. For the time being however, Toya continues to follow the tradition that her father and grandfather established: bringing fresh flowers directly from farm to market.
“We pride ourselves on the freshness and the quality of the product. That’s all we can really do. From my grandfather’s days, to my dad’s, to us. It’s always been that way,” Toya said.

The combination of giving and being savvy is the concept from which The Givve Collection derives its name as well as its function,  serving as an online marketplace that exclusively features charitable fashion products. Givve is a two-sided marketplace where not only do part of the proceeds from the customers’ purchases go to charity, but also the producers of the products make contributions themselves.
“Our customers are savvy because they want to buy chic things, but they also want to buy something that does more than put a shirt on their back — it puts a shirt on someone else’s back as well,” said founder and USC alumna Ashley Howell. “Our designers either give back per person, or they give back in an aggregate sense where they’ll give back 10 percent annually to a cause. We don’t limit our causes that vendors want to support, because they have a variety of causes they want to support. I know I do, personally.”
Though there are numerous foundations that support social causes, Howell said that the idea to integrate fashion with charity blossomed when she saw no outlet to shop for all of these items supporting a variety of causes provided through the same third-party vendor. Furthermore, Givve allows for personalization of the shopping experience, emphasized through features such as “Givve Lists” that customers can create by opening an account.
“We wanted to create more of a culture than a shopping site … around this idea of giving instead of shopping,” Howell said. “The benefit of the Givve Lists is that you can go on and group products by cause, product, brand, color, look — let’s say you want to put together an outfit for New Year’s Eve. You can put it together in a list and copy that link and send it to your friends.”
In addition to practicality, the list fosters a sentimental feeling toward the products.
“You create lists of products that you love, from people really passionate about whatever cause they support,” Howell said. “You can also write on the Givve List why you’re giving. For example, say you wanted to give to ovarian cancer because you lost a mom or an aunt or someone to the disease. You can write that on there, so people can further connect with why you’re doing this.”
Though the site officially launched on March 10, Howell said she started her business about 10 months ago while studying social entrepreneurship in her MBA program at Santa Clara University, after obtaining a degree in public policy at USC.
“I love fashion, and I love charity, so it was kind of like my two worlds in one,” she said. “It’s been 10 months of doing a lot of market research, and talking with vendors, and talking with customers, and seeing what’s already out there, and currently, there’s nothing like Givve. A lot has actually popped up over the last holiday season, so the market for this is really growing rapidly.”
Though she didn’t have a background in business, Howell said her experience at USC has proved invaluable in the context of her venture today, which reached 5,000 unique visitors per day on its site in the first week.
“My USC class ring — I actually haven’t take it off since I graduated,” Howell said. “It’s my little motivation — on a bad day, I go, ‘Remember you worked your ass off, you gotta keep going!’ Academically, I was really challenged. I can write a 30-page paper in a night but quantitative classes were always more of a challenge for me. With business school, it’s pretty much 50 percent of the classes are quantitative, so that was a little academic stretch for me going to business school, but I knew I could do it because I had my USC undergrad background.”
During her time at USC, Howell said she was a member of student government and the Panhellenic sorority Gamma Phi Beta. She also took part in charity work and participated in various mentoring projects. But more than the specific student organizations she was involved in, Howell said it was the life skills such as networking and being a leader that allowed her to turn her passion into a marketable product.
“I felt at USC, if you had a dream to go do something, you could just start it,” Howell said. “Just the confidence of the ‘follow your dreams’ kind of thing … I really feel like me being a Trojan influences everything.”
As for advice for students doubling as aspiring entrepreneurs, Howell said it’s imperative to consider both the professional and personal aspects of starting a business.
“The first is if you don’t have customers, it isn’t a market,” Howell said. “It can be a great idea, but if no one is actually going to buy something or go on a website or whatever the venture is, that’s a problem. So you really have to do your homework before you get into it.”
As for the personal side, Howell said that potential startup owners need to be prepared for the level of commitment that is demanded.
“There are nights and days where you’re just like, ‘This is not going to happen,’” Howell said. “But you have to believe in what you’re doing more than anybody. If you’re really passionate about it, you’re going to make it happen. You have to be willing to sacrifice and spend your free nights and days working on this. If I could work 48 hours in a day, I would. You can’t be lukewarm about a startup, that’s for sure.”

Only a few days into March Madness, the NCAA College Basketball Championship is still up for grabs. As is done every year, millions of fans turn their attention toward bracketology, in which fans vie to accurately predict the results of all 63 games of the tournament in order to win several thousand dollars in gift cards and bragging rights. The odds of accurately predicting the winners of the 63 games of the championship are, of course, astronomical. But with billions of dollars on the line, one best believe that fans would turn out in record numbers — or so hoped business magnate Warren Buffett.
On Jan. 21, Warren Buffett and president of promotions company SCA Promotions Bob Hamman, in cooperation with Quicken Loans, announced that they would present a cash prize totaling one billion dollars to anyone with a perfect bracket, according to the Wall Street Journal. By Friday, however, it was announced that none of the entrants remain in the running to win the $1 billion NCAA basketball challenge, according to ABC News. This wasn’t a matter of bad luck. With multiple low-ranking teams pulling out upsets in the first games of the championship, Buffett’s billion dollars were always safe and sound.
SCA Promotions assists companies in organizing promotional events from sponsorships to prizes on TV shows and has a business model centered on giving away products and money to consumers — of which the predicted incentives are enticing to companies. Brand recognition and long-term increases in sales are just two of the possible outcomes of a well-executed promotion.
It is fairly clear how operations such as My Coke Rewards can rack up free gifts from companies as diverse as Spotify and Delta Airlines when the cost of 30 days of Spotify Premium and a flight to Maui is generally low. One billion dollars, however, is a different story. Comprising more than 10 percent of Buffett’s net wealth, it is easily one of the largest sums SCA Promotions has promoted.
Even more interesting is what Buffett stood to gain from giving away that billion. Though Buffett himself is not a company, he serves as the face of his Fortune 500 company, Berkshire Hathaway, which nearly suffered during his decision with Hamman, according to the Wall Street Journal. On Jan. 30, BRK.B finally struck a low it had not seen since the first quarter of 2013.
Buffett’s billion-dollar bracket challenge wasn’t about charity or the competition. In all likelihood, the billion-dollar bracket challenge served as nothing more than a publicity stunt. Buffett seemed to be trying to save face and ensure stockholders that he was and continues to be unphased by the plunge of his stock.
And it worked. A little more than a week after Buffett announced his March Madness prize, Berkshire Hathaway stock began a steady climb that hasn’t ceased. Buffett stands as the third-richest person in the world with $63.7 billion dollars, according to Forbes. Eleven million brackets were entered into ESPN’s tournament — many more than the 8 million entered last year.
Buffett could afford to put a billion dollars on the line, especially since the odds were in his favor. What were the chances of winning this incredible prize? Little to none.
What has to be one of the more comforting things to Buffett and Hamman is that no one has ever won before. Out of millions of brackets from every year of ESPN’s bracket challenge, not one has ever been able to predict all 63 games. In fact, the chances of filling out that perfect bracket are approximately 1 in 9.2 quintillion, according to Business Insider. Written out that’s 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808.
So, it’s no surprise that only a few days into this year’s March Madness, not a single bracket is left sound in Buffett’s challenge. Once again, Buffett instigated a brilliant business move as carefully calculated as any of the companies that Berkshire Hathaway has bought and sold. This time, however, he disguised it as a fun and “free” game. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just a bit more sneaky than we’re used to seeing from our second-wealthiest American — heads up ,Bill Gates.

It is all about marketing. How much it would cost for this publicity.
 His average return for the last 3 years does not beat S&P500 or SPY that does not require his beautiful mind. The news his fund has a record year, so is EVERY BODY in a rising market again it does not beat SPY.
The small cap of last year beats his fund’s performance by a HUGE margin. It will give back as it is very seldom the small cap (or similar fund such as bio) beats the market by such a huge margin two years in a row. Hence, I would say it is a better chance for the large cap to beat the small cap this year.
I do have a chapter to debunk the myths of Buffett in my book Debunk the Myths in Investing (amazon).

I hate working out. It keeps me away from my happiest place: stuffing my face with mint chocolate chip ice cream. I do, however, subject myself to exercising at least three times per week, or at least that’s what I tell my physician to keep her happy. And usually while running on the treadmill, I turn on something I would usually consider trivial in a French salon, such as reality shows that transport me to a place where the biggest problems are if so-and-so throws a better party than her best frenemy or if a person’s picture has enough likes on Instagram. Lately, I’ve been watching a lot of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, a phenomenon so glaring that it has led Kim, who I deem the most prominent sister, and her other half, Kanye West, to land the cover of the newest edition of Vogue.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
Before I had immersed myself in a world where everyone’s name started with a “K,” I rolled my eyes at the Kardashian clan. I didn’t understand the sudden fascination with a family who capitalized upon an invasion of their privacy. Kim has a net worth of more than $40 million, according to Huffington Post. This is a sum that is garnered from various sponsorships, a role in a Tyler Perry movie and a broadcasted wedding for a marriage that lasted 72 days. To illustrate the pull the show has on people, the Kardashian sisters have a combined total of more than 41 million followers on Twitter.
But now I understand the Kardashian pandemonium. I am a naturally curious person, so I am inclined to be interested in their extravagant lives. Watching the show, as scripted and feigned-suspenseful as it may be, provides me an escape from my mundane life. These explanations are what I expect to be reasons behind why masses of people find Keeping Up with the Kardashians so interesting. This is why I didn’t even bat an eye when the newest edition of Vogue was unleashed.
Social media users criticized the new cover of Vogue, with Twitter users threatening to cancel their subscriptions and Seth Rogen and James Franco photoshopping their faces in place of Kim and Kanye’s. Even Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy joined in on the comic relief, posing for their spoof of Vogue, Vague. I can see why there has been backlash toward the cover. USA Today explains that until the late 1990s, only models graced the cover of Vogue. Since then, mostly actresses, singers and athletes have found their way onto the cover.
Vogue is the pinnacle embrace of high fashion, but there are obvious attempts within the magazine to reach out to the greater population. A lot of people appreciate high fashion, but not a lot of people can feel a connection to a size-0 model or an actress. Kim Kardashian’s presence is ubiquitous, and her cover allows us — or maybe just me — to feel like we’re a part of a bigger movement. For a universal concept such as appearance, to isolate certain people’s participation is ludicrous. Everyone can participate in the evolution of media this way because the reason we find certain people on the cover of certain magazines is due to the credit we give them.
Vogue’s new cover signifies an adaptation to the current social climate, something that is needed to foster a bridge between a secluded realm in fashion and the common person. I toast my bowl of mint chocolate chip ice cream to Anna Wintour, the fashion bible’s editor-in-chief, because this just might be high fashion’s answer to inclusiveness.
