Last week, Amazon opened its long-awaited convenience store, Amazon Go, to the public. Located in downtown Seattle, the store employs Amazon’s groundbreaking “Just Walk Out” technology that enables an unexpectedly efficient customer shopping experience, with none of the hassles of the traditional supermarket — that is, no cashiers, no shopping carts and, most notably, no checkout lines. 
Shoppers with the store’s mobile app simply walk into Amazon Go and scan their smartphones on a subway station-like turnstile. Once inside, hundreds of boxy black ceiling cameras track shoppers’ movements. Many items have camera-friendly codes to help the cameras understand which items have been picked up or put back down, and the computers augment that information with data from weight sensors installed in the shelves in a powerful combination of computer vision and machine-learning algorithms. When shoppers are done, they simply walk back out through the same gates they entered, without pausing to wait in line or pull out a credit card. Customers’ Amazon accounts automatically update with a receipt for what they took out the door, along with a “trip timer” telling them how many seconds they spent on the shopping trip. 
This futuristic grab-and-go technology, which spent over a year in beta testing, signals the advent of an entirely new customer shopping experience. Quite simply, Amazon Go is the future of consumer shopping, and USC needs to stay on the cutting edge by adopting a similar concept on campus that would greatly benefit its students. While implementing Amazon’s exact “Just Walk Out” technology may be fraught with a variety of issues surrounding pricing, the opening of Amazon Go should serve as a wake-up call for how the University can streamline its own inefficient and time-consuming checkout processes across campus. 
With the “Just Walk Out” technology, there would be no more waiting in long lines at the bookstore, Target or Trader Joe’s. Even the lines at Seeds, Starbucks and other popular on-campus spots that combine grab-and-go models with customized on-the-spot purchases could be alleviated. Furthermore, with the installation of more advanced camera systems, shoplifting would also be heavily reduced. 
Of course, some may argue that while this all sounds high-tech and trendy, what will it cost? After all, the technology relies on sophisticated data-gathering to transform the shopping experience, and many are worried about violations of privacy. However, many are already giving up a sizable amount of data every day, whether they realize it or not. We live in an age where millennials and members of Generation Z are using facial recognition to sign into their iPhones, where websites tailor their marketing based on our personal search histories and where many of the apps on our phones have geo-trackers. In fact, the data collected by Amazon Go is no more than what most people give away at their traditional supermarkets by using their credit cards. 
The second main outcry against this avant-garde technology is that it would displace cashier jobs due to automation. At USC, the main concern would be for students holding on-campus jobs at places potentially affected by the model, such as the bookstore. While this model may eliminate some manual, repetitive work, it would not entirely eliminate the need for human jobs, and would simply change the role of employees. Amazon itself says that at Amazon Go, employees will work on different tasks that require human skill, including helping guide shoppers to the right items, checking drivers’ licenses for alcohol sales or stocking shelves and preparing meal kits.
Perhaps the University doesn’t need to install technology exactly like “Just Walk Out” in order to streamline its checkout processes. For example, there are many ways USC could optimize the check-in process at campus dining halls. Instead of forming long lines at the peak lunch hour and individually handing our USCards to one attendee, perhaps we could move to an Amazon-esque model where we simply walk in and scan our IDs, and the visit is automatically recorded to our USC accounts. 
If we could perfect this concept, then other powerful applications at USC could follow, including tracking class attendance and distributing game-day gear during the busiest weekends of football season, where thousands of people flock to the USC Bookstore at the same time. 
Ultimately, while the full Amazon Go experience isn’t expected to expand elsewhere any time soon due to its financial and computing-intensive nature, the store’s opening does prompt the important question: How can our current systems be better? While Amazon Go may be seen as trendy but impractical for now, it is the future, and should get us all thinking about how we can revolutionize practices we take for granted in our daily lives — things as simple as the way we shop at the grocery store. 
Hold your horses. I know you millennials don’t know the concept of patience, but it will eventually come. This Amazon Go has only been around for about a week, sheesh. Instant gratification mentality!

Although our federal government ground to a halt last weekend, it’s election season for USC’s Undergraduate Student Government. That means canvassing on Trousdale Parkway, even more crowded Facebook feeds and yes, possibly an In-N-Out truck in McCarthy Quad. But it also means low-voter turnout and a two-week exhibition of student apathy on display. Yet 2018 must represent an outlier for student turnout and engagement if USC students hope to harness the political energy of 2017.
As the Co-Director of the Service Student Assembly, I’m fairly well-acquainted with USG’s election routine. Candidates announce their bids on Jan. 25, and what follows in the next two weeks is a flurry of campaigning, as undergraduates solicit votes through social media, yard signs, stickers and quasi-desperate attempts at conversation in the quad. Up for election lies our presidential and vice presidential candidates running on a ticket, and the offices of 12 senators, who serve as a check and balance while also promoting advocacy initiatives.
Few dispute that USC as a whole remains politically apathetic. After all, on the college prep website Niche, in response to the question “What political party do you associate yourself with?” the second highest response for USC students was “I don’t care about politics.” Therefore, it’s not surprising that these crumbs of activism and engagement hardly trickle down to student government elections, with only 5,411 students voting last year out of an undergraduate student body population of 19,000 students. And that turnout constituted a 46.2 percent increase from the previous year.
While limited engagement and activism on campus reflects a misguided belief that students can remain insulated from local, state and federal policies, there’s little reason for students to sit on the sidelines on election day. With Sustainability 2020 goals imminent, marginalized populations such as DACA students at risk, an escalating mental health crisis, rising housing costs, a lack of affordable food, ongoing diversity discourse, concerns of inclusion and questions of community engagement, the stakes appear higher than a mere popularity contest.
False narratives often dictate the discourse surrounding campus policies. Some perceive USG as powerless, but its budget of $2.3 million dollars, staff of over 100 students and various projects, events and initiatives tell a different story. Others write USG off as ineffective, but a cost-free Uber program (now Lyft), Smoke-Free Campus Resolution and Campus Climate resolution show this could not be further from the truth.
The next few weeks remain pivotal for campus change and policy not only for the next year, but also for the future, with a new set of students ready to assume the mantle of leadership. But as with any election, an uneducated vote is a wasted vote. Students must not fall into complacency and disengagement because voting for the first names on the ballot or for  one’s friends represents passive and incomplete engagement. Platforms and experience represent values, and students must wisely research whom they select to lead their university.
As with politics outside the bounds of campus, engagement hardly ends with election day. All students hold a stake in campus policies, whether through Greek life restructuring, diversity initiatives or food and housing insecurity. Therefore, it remains our responsibility to press for advocacy and change, to push ourselves to become more educated and aware, join and create clubs and initiatives and engage in our campus community and well-being. Anyone and everyone can and should propose advocacy resolutions, attend open USG Senate meetings, apply to different boards and assemblies, schedule meetings with administrators and faculty, research the work of other universities and their policies and keep up with campus news.
With accessible polling stations and no gerrymandering or restrictive voter ID laws, only apathy stands in the way of students and entry level political engagement. Low voter turnout need not be a foregone conclusion; as a campus, we must resolve to make 2018 a new year of involvement and activism. All it takes is a minute of your time, and perhaps an In-N-Out burger in exchange.

Jack Swanson, who plays the titular character Candide, dazzles in his debut performance at the LA Opera, balancing the play’s emotional moments with those that are more light-hearted. Photo courtesy of Ken Howard
The closing curtsies of the cast of Candide, an English-language operetta with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Richard Wilbur, were met with thunderous applause on opening night. With a revised libretto by John Caird based on the 1759 satirical novel by the French philosopher Voltaire, Candide stars Jack Swanson in the title role, five-time Emmy Award winning actor Kelsey Grammer in the dual role of Voltaire and Dr. Pangloss and Erin Morley as leading lady Cunegonde. All three leads made their LA Opera debuts in the two-hour and thirty-minute production, directed by Francesca Zambello and conducted by James Conlon. 
Voltaire, the narrator, pokes fun at the Leibniz philosophy that this is “the best of all possible worlds” and harbors an optimistic worldview due to Dr. Pangloss’ teachings. Believing everything to be simply the best possible scenario, Candide grows to be a kind-hearted man and falls in love with Cunegonde, a baron’s daughter. Simple-minded and materialistic, Cunegonde imagines a much more luxurious marriage with Candide. As the couple endures tragedy after tragedy, they must face the reality that this might actually be “the worst of all possible worlds” in the song “Words, Words, Words.”
The show-stopping number occurs in Act One, when Cunegonde mourns the loss of her innocence while revelling in her newfound riches in the coloratura aria “Glitter and Be Gay.” Although it is one of the most difficult soprano pieces to perform, Morley hit every note perfectly while dancing wildly and even lying down at one point. 
This song encompasses the bittersweet, satirical nature of the operetta as Cunegonde switches quickly from laughing to crying, from gloating about her sapphire jewelry to lamenting her ruined life. Candide, too, grows weary of the meaning of all the troubles he’s endured to reunite with his love in “Nothing More Than This.” Later, Candide and Cunegonde’s worldview is tinged with a spark of hope as they admit “We’re neither pure, nor wise, nor good [but] we’ll do the best we know” in “Make Our Garden Grow (Finale).”
The operetta combines the utopian philosophy of optimism with the imaginative, ironic and intense story-within-a-story plot of Man of La Mancha. After all, the musical production includes the original novelist as a main character, drawing attention to the dichotomy between Pangloss’s proposed philosophy and the harsher, realistic ending Voltaire imagined.
Overall, Candide brings a whirlwind of emotion in the crazy, disastrous yet delightful lives of Candide and Cunegonde. Characters appear to die and later come back to life, and there are a great many serendipitous reunions while Pangloss’ students ultimately reject his philosophy. Sweet-faced Swanson had the audience rooting for him to keep his faith in the goodness of others and the perfection of the world, while Grammer, on the other hand, had the audience members laughing, cheering and whistling until the very end, when the entire cast and ensemble received a well-earned standing ovation.
This production of Candide, co-produced by The Glimmerglass Festival, Opéra National de Bordeaux and Théatre du Capitole de Toulouse, will be performed at LA Opera’s Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in downtown Los Angeles with projected lyrics on five select dates until Feb. 18. Tickets range from $44 to $349.

Dake’s 22-track More Life  compilation wasn’t the first overly bloated project to hit the market when it dropped last year, nor has it been the last — but his decision to term it as a “playlist” rather than an album raised many eyebrows. Playlists have become the dominant method of consuming music in recent years, and while many artists have dabbled in curating their own collections for public consumption on Spotify and Apple Music, none before had come with the heavily anticipated release date and the widespread promotion typically reserved for albums.
More Life’s categorization could certainly be seen as Drake’s method of capturing sounds from around the globe and solidifying his status as a tastemaker, but moreover it was a way to cash in on the rise of music streaming, allowing himself more opportunities to earn the fractions of pennies available with each stream. Now, Migos’ Culture II is the latest album to follow this trend, containing a hefty 24 songs for listeners to sift through. Clocking in at a whopping one hour and 45 minutes, Culture II runs longer than many movies do, and is even three minutes longer than Quality Control’s entire Control the Streets compilation album in which the group contributed heavily to.

The music industry — and hip-hop especially — evolves faster than your friendly neighborhood Caterpie in a Pokmon game, and with more songs equating to more money, it’s unlikely that artists like Migos care too much about album purists crying for shorter tracklists and a more cohesive listen-through. However, “cohesive” and “extensive” are not mutually exclusive terms when it comes to a project; the two are fully able to coexist, it just requires a little extra creativity from the responsible creatives.
Rapper Big K.R.I.T. struggled against his label Def Jam to put out his music for years, eventually choosing to leave the company and work independently instead. 4Eva Is A Mighty Long Time, his first release after departing, contained 22 songs and is by no means a short listen, yet still manages to retain the listener’s attention thanks to its double-disc format. The Mississippi rapper fills the first half of the album with a mix of hard-hitting bangers and relaxed, mellow grooves, while spending the latter portion giving an introspective look into the world of Justin Scott, the real-life individual behind the Big K.R.I.T. persona. Wasting none of the album’s 82 minutes with overly repetitive beats and lyrics, it was one of the strongest hip-hop projects of 2017, while still granting him plenty of chances to pick up those ever-so-valuable song streams to rake in the revenue.
The double-album isn’t the only way to get the most out of a lengthy tracklist, however — R&B star Jhené Aiko also needed 22 songs to tell her story on Trip. Weaving lyrics about love, loss and redemption around the concept of a rather intense experience on LSD, Jhené parallels her roller coaster emotional state with the music behind her, creating a layered album with a mood that rises and falls throughout. Songs like “Moments” open the album on a positive note before the situation becomes more grave in the middle of the album on “Nobody,” until Jhené victoriously emerges on the other side of the tunnel on “Frequency.” The result is a project that allows for a worthwhile experience when played front-to-back, but is still just as enjoyable when split off into various playlists. 
With no clear storyline linking Culture II together and no apparent intentions from the group to do so, it’s somewhat useless to judge the project by the same standards as other albums. In fact, as it falls more in line with the “playlist” philosophy, it’s somewhat useless to judge the project at all until it’s had appropriate time to make its intended impact, diced and shuffled into booming, trap-heavy collections. Still, other artists have proven that it’s possible to optimize streaming potential without wasting the original album format; hopefully more are able to discover the right balance going forward.
Anyway, here’s what’s on my mind in the world of music this week.
Why I’m smiling: Chris Dave and the Drumhedz’ self-titled debut album
A drummer by trade, Chris Dave made himself into an industry household name thanks to his work with acclaimed artists such as Adele, D’Angelo and even Justin Bieber on his 2015 album Purpose. On Chris Dave and the Drumhedz, however, he shows that he’s more than capable of standing on his own. While his work on the drums unsurprisingly carries the project, soulful melodies on songs like “Spread Her Wings” give the album sonic depth and impressive instrumentation. Not to mention two Anderson .Paak features? You had me at the first hi-hat.
Why I’m shaking my head: Joey Bada$$ says rap is in “a very trash state”
How many times do we have to have this conversation? Radio rap (and Spotify’s influential RapCaviar playlist, to be frank) could certainly stand to become less monotonous, but in the digital age, there’s plenty of other platforms where hip-hop is as diverse as ever. Artists like Smino, Goldlink and BROCKHAMPTON are proving it’s possible to break into the mainstream with an original sound. With a little more effort on the part of consumers, perhaps more talented artists will be able to have their shine as well.
Why I’m hopeful for the future: TDE Championship Tour
After the label released arguably the two best albums of 2017 in Kendrick Lamar’s DAMN. and SZA’s Ctrl, there is no better title for their upcoming victory lap across the country. Top Dawg is bringing the entire roster — with the exception of rapper Isaiah Rashad, for reasons still unclear — on what is sure to be one of the marquee tours of the summer, with 29 dates lined up between May and June. Tickets won’t be cheap, but with a laundry list of names that could easily rival a single-day festival lineup, it will certainly be worth it.

A sluggish offensive effort in the first half for USC was overcome by a blazing shooting spree in the final period of play, as the Trojans came away with a 77-59 victory against visiting Cal at the Galen Center on Sunday. 
Sophomore guard Jonah Matthews continued his recent hot streak, scoring 16 points on four 3-pointers against Cal. Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
USC was led in scoring by senior guard Elijah Stewart and sophomore guard Jonah Mathews, who both chipped in 16 points apiece for the Trojans. 
The victory is USC’s sixth-consecutive in conference play. The Trojans (17-6 overall, 8-2 in Pac-12) currently find themselves a half-game behind conference-leading Arizona in the Pac-12 standings. 
“It’s always difficult winning in the Pac-12,” said USC senior guard Jordan McLaughlin, who finished with 9 points (3-of-7 FG) and 10 assists against Cal. “The fact that we’ve been able to pull off six straight wins, we just want to keep it going. We’re entering one of the tougher parts of our schedule now, so we’ve just got to keep taking it day-by-day.” 
In the closing seconds of the first half, Mathews connected on a 3-point field goal that gave USC a narrow 31-29 lead at the break. The Trojans would not relinquish this lead for the remainder of the contest. 
“[Mathews] brings a spark on defense and offense for us,” McLaughlin said. “Coach gives us all a lot of freedom to shoot the ball, but especially to [Mathews]. When he’s in rhythm, he can knock down 8-of-10 shots from anywhere on the floor.” 
The first half saw USC shoot 11-for-34 (32.4 percent) from the field. The Trojans shot 2-of-8 (25 percent) from beyond the arc in the opening half. 
“We took some really tough, contested shots in the lane (in the first half),” USC head coach Andy Enfield said. “[First half struggles] came down to shot selection … We only had four assists in the first half, we had 13 in the second half. That’s why we were able to score more points later.” 
USC came out firing offensively to open up the second half. Over the first seven minutes of the second period, USC went on a 15-5 run to open their lead on Cal to 46-34. The run was powered by three 3-point field goals from Stewart to open the half. 
“[Stewart’s] been doing that for us for four years now,” Enfield said, regarding Stewart’s hot-shooting. “He’s a great shooter when his feet are set, and we need him to do that for our team. He’s a big part of our team … When he’s knocking down shots, it probably means our team is about to go on a run.” 
Stewart, who was held scoreless in the first half (0-for-3 FG), was a major catalyst for USC offensively when it widened the gap on Cal (7-15, 1-8) in the second half. Stewart hit 4-of-5 3-point field goal attempts in the second half, enroute to a 16-point performance.
For the second consecutive game, the Trojans were without junior forward Bennie Boatwright (averaging 15.2 PPG this season), who is dealing with a foot injury. 
In a second half, which saw USC outscore Cal 46-30, the Trojans shot 8-for-13 from 3-point range. Overall, USC was 17-for-29 (58.6 percent) from the field in the second half.
Cal senior forward Marcus Lee finished with the game-high in both points scored, 23, and rebounds, 12. Golden Bears freshman guard Darius McNeill contributed 13 points in a losing-effort for Cal. 
USC’s largest lead of the night came on a dunk from freshman forward Victor Uyaelunmo with just over two minutes remaining in regulation. The dunk gave the Trojans a 75-53 lead on Cal.
“Despite the score, that was probably the hardest 20-point game I’ve played in a long time,” Stewart said. “[Cal] just kept coming back and staying in it. So it was a good win.” 
USC held the Golden Bears to 11-of-34 (32.4 percent) shooting from the field in the second half. Overall, Cal finished Sunday shooting 22-for-57 (38.6 percent) from the field. USC improved to 8-0 this season, when holding opponents to under 40 percent shooting. 
The Golden Bears have now lost eight-consecutive games, the longest losing streak for Cal since the 1992 season. 
USC will next take the floor on Feb. 3, when it hits the road to face crosstown rival UCLA (15-7, 6-4) at Pauley Pavilion in Westwood.

Over the weekend, sophomore guard Minyon Moore scored 14 points against Washington State and 9 points against Washington. Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan
After two tough losses at home, the women’s basketball team turned things around in Washington this weekend by finishing with two victories. Friday’s game against Washington State came down to the wire after the Trojans made a huge comeback from behind.
On Sunday afternoon, USC continued its momentum with a convincing 72-61 win over Washington.
It was the Trojans’ defense that made the difference in both games. Against WSU, the Trojans were down in the fourth quarter until a combined effort from the team finally gave them a 4-point lead. When WSU drained a 3-pointer, got a stop and the defensive rebound, they had a chance to take it all. However, USC would not back down, and played strong, clean defense to secure the win.
“I mean we knew from the beginning that our defense was what was going to win us basketball games and that’s what we do,” Adams said. “When our offense isn’t working or we’re feeling like we aren’t doing what we are supposed to do, take care of things offensively, we just know that if we lock in and play defense and get these stops, we can win games.”
They carried over that defensive fire from the final minutes on Friday into Sunday’s game against Washington. From the beginning of the game, USC was aggressive without picking up too many fouls. At the end of the first quarter, the Trojans had held Washington to only 6 points. By halftime, Washington had only managed to score 13 more points, while the Trojans finished with 40 to go into the locker room with a 21-point lead.
“Our defense was really good,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “We came back in the last six minutes [on Friday] and today we played great defense in the first half and we did a real good job. We got a lot of steals, converted it to a lot of layups, so it was good.”
One of the most impressive factors of the games this weekend is that the starting five players are averaging more minutes than their opponents’ starters. However, the Trojans are maintaining their fighting spirit until the end, giving everything they have without falling into sloppy or lazy defense due to fatigue. Instead, they are digging deep, still taking long range shots, and still battling for every rebound.
“With our starting five, it’s just pure will and power,” Adams said. “It is just really mental for us. A lot of people, they think we were not mentally strong, but I know this team and we’re tough, tough as nails, and we’re really showing that this year and people can tell that.
Next, the Trojans will face UCLA at Pauley Pavilion on Friday.
“It’s good to come home with two wins” Trakh said. “We have the big rivalry game against UCLA, so we will see what happens.”
Coach Trakh doing a fine job with only five players who can score, and have to play almost the entire game.
Cynthia Cooper left the cupboard bare with players leaving and not being recruited for this season. The lady’s
deserve a medal of some kind for all the minutes they play which cost them tough losses vs. better teams in the
end.

Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
Baseball is the most exciting sport. I have played baseball for as long as I can remember, so it might be a bit biased for me to make this claim. But I have a justification for it. 
I am getting really tired of watching the same teams compete for championships. The New England Patriots win the Super Bowl seemingly every year, Alabama wins the College Football Playoffs and the NBA Championship is a toss up between the Warriors and the Cavs. It’s just boring now. 
Unlike its counterparts, the MLB hasn’t had a repeat winner since the 2000 season when the New York Yankees won their third World Series Ring in a row. In the College World Series, there hasn’t been a three-year championship streak since, oddly enough, the USC Trojans won five rings from 1970-1974. 
The average person can usually predict the winner of any basketball or football game by just picking the higher ranked team. On the other hand, in baseball, there is always the possibility that the absolute worst team in the league will upset the No. 1 seed. 
Think back to 2012. The Houston Astros had one of its worst seasons in franchise history. They finished with a laughable 55-107 record and ended 42 games behind the division-winning Cincinnati Reds and 33 games behind a wild card berth. To put it lightly, they were horrible, but they still beat the World Series Champion San Francisco Giants once that season. Not to mention the fact that just five years later the Astros went on to win the 2017 World Series.
I have been following baseball for a long time, but before 2016 I had never heard of Coastal Carolina University. That year the Chanticleers seemingly came out of nowhere to knock off a dominant Texas Christian team to advance to the championship series, which they would win over Arizona. If that’s not exciting, then I don’t know what is. 
One of my gripes about other sports, particularly football, is that the seasons are too short. With 162 games, the MLB season is able to see past fluke wins and bad calls to determine the best 10 teams to play in the postseason.
I understand that the frequency and amount of football games in a season cannot be increased because of health concerns. I merely appreciate the ability a baseball season has to predict the best teams to compete for the championship.
Perhaps the most exciting part of this sport is that the game is not over until the last out is made. Every other major sport relies on a clock to signify the end of the game. In baseball, the pitcher is obligated to give the opposing team their chance to score runs. 
In the 2017 ALCS, the Detroit Tigers squared off against the Boston Red Sox. In the second game of the series, the Tigers led the Red Sox by a score of 5-2 entering the bottom of the eighth inning. As a Michigan native and Detroit Tigers fanatic, I felt very confident that the cats would pull out of that game with a win, but I knew the game wasn’t over. Unfortunately, I was right. 
In the bottom of the eighth, future Hall of Famer David Ortiz pounded a grand slam to put the Sox at equal score with the Tigers. That score held until the bottom of the ninth when Jarrod Saltalamacchia batted in Jonny Gomes to walk off the game.
Thinking back to that game, I realized the implications of having to give the trailing team their chances. What if Tigers’ pitcher Max Scherzer was able to kneel the ball? Would the Tigers have advanced to the World Series and made a championship run? We will never know.
With all of that being said, I look to USC Trojans baseball. The Men of Troy haven’t had a winning record since 2015 and finished the 2016 season with a measly .382 winning percentage. But I know in the sport of baseball there is always hope.

In 2000, USC received an anonymous donation of $20 million. The donor wished for the money to go toward an increase in the representation of women in engineering and science at the University.

The gift sparked conversations across campus on how to increase gender diversity within USC’s STEM programs. After several meetings and discussions among faculty from the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the organization Women in Science and Engineering was born.
The program is intended to create a more female-friendly workplace and learning environment for researchers, students and faculty.
“I think the best thing about WiSE is that it creates a community of women who can meet together and find camaraderie,” WiSE program manager Mallory Redel said. “A lot of women, especially in the least-represented departments, may be the only women or the only woman in their laboratory. So it’s really good for them to meet other people from other labs and other departments where they can share experiences and talk about ‘I’m not alone in this.’”
Kylie Burdsall, a junior majoring in biochemistry, was involved with WiSE last summer . As an undergraduate fellow, she received stipends for conducting research over the summer and into the academic year. 
She said having a graduate student mentor enhanced her excitement for working in the lab. Because of the level of support the WiSE program offers, Burdsall has had the opportunity  to work closely with her mentor not only in labs, but also with graduate school applications, professional support and advice.
“It’s great for older grad students to get involved because I think such a huge part of me having such a positive experience was having a graduate student mentor,” Burdsall said. “I think the program wouldn’t be the same without it.”
WiSE gives female students grants, awards and scholarships to encourage research and create opportunities that they may otherwise be unable to pursue due to tuition, travel or housing costs. These monetary awards are distributed to faculty, graduate and undergraduate students.
In addition to providing financial and academic support for students, WiSE specializes in professional development workshops, hosting speakers and networking events among female faculty. Since 2000, WiSE has more than tripled the number of women faculty in USC science and engineering departments, according to Redel.
WiSE Gabilan assistant professor Heather Culbertson started working at USC this semester and said she is already impressed with the inclusivity of the program.
“What I’ve noticed about the WiSE community is how welcoming everyone is to all women in engineering,” Culbertson said. “WiSE is ‘Women in Science and Engineering’ but it’s also open to men who are advocates for women in science and engineering. [It definitely encourages]  men to become involved as well.”
Redel said the program is currently focusing on creating interdisciplinary support for graduate and Ph.D. students.
“This year we established a WiSE Ph.D. Advisory Board, which is made up of members from varying departments within the engineering school and then sciences and mathematics, so they can really work together and focus on coming up with a more centralized community of Ph.D. students,” Redel said.

The USC School of Dramatic Arts hosted a retirement celebration in the Bing Theater honoring SDA professor Jack Rowe. At the celebration, a new scholarship called the Jack Rowe Student Endowed Scholarship Fund was introduced to honor Rowe’s legacy as a retired actor and director of the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Acting program at USC.

“Jack Rowe’s sharp wit and deep knowledge of the written text has made a lasting impact in the classroom and beyond,” the event’s invitation on the SDA website stated. “We hope you will be able to join us as we celebrate his career and his decades of service to SDA.”
Rowe graduated from USC in 1966 with a degree in economics, but returned to the University in the late 1970s to teach evening drama classes. Since  he began teaching, Rowe became a respected faculty member in the SDA community until his retirement last year, USC News said.
Over the course of his teaching career at USC, Rowe taught about Shakespeare and BA acting classes. 
Additionally, he directed numerous plays including Boris Vian’s The Empire Builder, Arthur Schnitzler’s La Ronde and Shakespeare’s Measure for Measure.
“As a teacher, administrator, leader, stage and artistic director, mentor and departmental muse, Jack’s no-nonsense passion for the theater and his deep well of knowledge have been the source of inspiration for legions of students,” said David Bridel, dean of the USC School of Dramatic Arts and the Braverman Family Dean’s Chair, according to USC News release. 
During his career as a play director, Rowe also served on the play selection committee and was promoted to the school’s artistic director. He read through countless scripts and guided the committee through the approximately two dozen musicals and plays the school put on each year, USC News said. 
In his remarks during the celebration on Jan. 21, Bridel emphasized that Rowe’s contribution to SDA went beyond academics and into helping the school flourish. 
“You inspire us, as the most unpretentiously passionate educator ever to grace these classrooms and stages,” Bridel said according to the SDA website. “You’re going to live on in these corridors and on these stages forever, not just because of the scholarship we are building in your name — and a heartfelt thanks to all contributors to the Jack Rowe scholarship fund — but also because the blood, sweat and tears you left on these planks can never, will never, be scrubbed away.”
