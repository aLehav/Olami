On Wednesday, USC Concerts Committee announced the highly anticipated performers for Springfest 2018, which will include rappers Playboi Carti and Sheck Wes as its openers and indie rock band Glass Animals as its headliner. Although the committee has a reputation for booking some of the most popular up-and-coming artists, it’s worth noting that in the past eight years Springfest has been held, there have been few female performers and no female headliners.

At a time when the national conversation has shifted to demand gender parity in the entertainment and music industries, it’s necessary for USC and its student organizations to reflect a mindset of inclusivity on campus as well.
The Concerts Committee has traditionally based its lineup selection on various factors, including talent, name recognition and musical diversity. This year, the decision to headline Glass Animals — a four-member, all-male group — came after the committee received student feedback calling for a band rather than solo performers. 
Glass Animals has made a name for itself in the indie rock scene, playing on prominent stages like Coachella, Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo. The group also appeals to audiences who gravitate to the rock scene, creating a diverse set alongside rappers Playboi Carti and Sheck Wes. But the Springfest stage could be better utilized in future years to amplify female artists who offer similar musical qualities and genres that appeal to students. 
Failure to represent female musicians is not just a USC issue. Underrepresentation of women is systemic and allows for the underpayment and devaluation of women and their talents in entertainment. A 2018 report by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative reveals that women are still underrepresented in music rankings, Grammy nominees and the songwriting and production processes. 
The report found that female performers, songwriters and producers are all “egregiously outnumbered,” with 2017 marking a six-year low for female representation in popular music; women comprised just 16.8 percent of chart-topping artists. It concluded that the “ecosystem of entertainment” largely excludes women or relegates women to the periphery. 
This seems surprising, since female voices appear ubiquitous on the radio, in popular collaborations and the backdrops of electronic remixes. However, this underrepresentation occurs on large stages. Last year, Lady Gaga made history as the first female headliner in a decade at Coachella, and Lollapalooza’s 2018 lineup received backlash for not headlining any female musicians or even listing them until the fourth line in its poster. 
The absence of female performers from major stages is just a symptom of the aforementioned entertainment “ecosystem” in which men dominate content production and women’s voices are minimized as a result. Of the 651 music producers in the Annenberg study, 98 percent were men. A major reason many  women are unable to find a platform in this industry is that men — who hold the keys to entry — cannot fully understand the obstacles women must overcome to ascend the professional ladder. Put simply, representation matters on every level.
The exclusion of a female artist from the Springfest lineup may not have been intentional or egregious. Representation might not have been at the forefront of the committee’s mindset, and after all, a college concert is not a large enough stage to set an example for the greater industry. But looking back at Springfest’s history of performers and the importance of diversity, it’s time for USC to make a conscious effort to consider and recognize female artists.
In the past year, our collective national consciousness has shifted to the topic of gender representation, buttressed by the advent of the #MeToo movement. The music arena is no exception as an industry in which popular discourse is predominantly driven by men and male voices. 
Through expanding the occupational opportunities and agency of women in music, women are granted an equal voice in the industry and public sphere at large. As a hugely influential institution in the entertainment world and as the host of an annual musical event as large as Springfest, USC and its student organizations have a stake in this fight, and a responsibility to open our stages to female artists.

President Donald Trump was about to deliver a speech on tax policy Thursday when he abruptly stopped, setting the paper down. Why? “It’s boring,” as the president so candidly put it. “We have to tell it like it is,” he added.
Trump employs one of two strategies whenever addressing anything he doesn’t like, or facing situations he’d rather not consider — first: hyperbole; second: distraction. Unfortunately for the country, the result of combining these strategies is that we get no clear definition of policy intention, no real understanding of what the president believes or what he stands for. Just a few weeks ago, taxes were the highest priority on the president’s mind (ostensibly); today, he pauses amid a chance to address his intentions for the American fiscal future to go off on a tirade about immigration and Democrats.
The important bit about this particular wave of vitriol is that, in the middle of his first term, after passing an omnibus funding bill and with more legislation on the agenda, Trump turns, when “bored,” to what Trump knows best — the racism that characterized his campaign continues to enliven the nastier parts of his base and will probably also fuel a 2020 reelection bid if he chooses to make one. Citing an attack last October in lower Manhattan, Trump stated, “This is what Democrats are doing to you.” And he follows the script with more of the same, sensationalized and racially inflammatory rhetoric:  scary immigrants, irresponsible Democrats, border wall, brandishing threats, garnering fear. True to the pattern, we have to ask, what is he trying to distract us from?
Perhaps it could be the fact that, in lieu of the border wall that failed to receive funding due to the omnibus funding bill passed last week, Trump has elected (or pretended to support — it’s unclear what is really a priority or concern, and what’s a cheap cast to rile up the base) to deploy National Guard forces to the U.S.-Mexico border. This decision comes despite increased funding for the reparation of existing infrastructure and the hiring of more border enforcement officials. 
And, as usual, key members of the administration — Mattis, in particular, in this case — are once more left out of the loop by the president’s declarations and scrambling to put together a critical, comprehensive plan to match what appears to be a consistent string of dictatorial declarations. Details for the mission, including scope, cost and duration, have yet to be determined by White House officials. There is no ballpark figure of how many of our troops will be deployed to an empty desert, despite, of course, Trump’s assertion that they would be deployed “immediately.” Whatever “immediately” might mean, or what Trump considers his cabinet to be doing about that proposed timeline is also unclear.
More important is the audacity with which the president of a multiracial and multilingual nation, priding itself on being a nation that receives the “sick,” the “huddled masses,” has so fervently taken to the justification of the discrimination, obfuscation and exile of a group of people to whom he has ascribed false national security concerns. To this group Trump attributes a host of his base’s worst fears about globalization, cultural shifts and national progression that are neither their fault nor under the span of its control. In short, Trump has redirected white anger toward another scapegoated group — just as he has done in the past with black and Muslim communities.
Trump’s venom for people of color is no secret; but what’s concerning is the manner in which he is diverting real, concrete resources from other national concerns toward approaching and assailing what is essentially the strawman of Trump’s “national security” platform. After all, if he were prepared to treat immigration with real consideration, and as a real national security issue, why would he continually resist attempts from both parties to come to the table regarding comprehensive immigration reform? Why would he not be championing the existing bills that attempted to address this issue even before the omnibus funding bill was passed?
I’ll repeat the same thing I’ve been writing for the past few weeks: It is within the legislature that our hope rests for a better future moving forward, one that doesn’t include a ham-handed attempt at taxation legislation or a total abdication of the responsibility of immigration reform. The only way to support the communities that continue to be targeted by this sort of behavior, and to fight the coming executive decisions and legislative agendas that are sure to be drummed up to match, is to vote. Perhaps the Blue Wave may not be as strong as some of California’s most ardent progressives believe, but certainly, Trump continues to do it many favors. Remember moments like these when you head to the polls.

When news surfaced about the Museum of Selfies, some millennials were intrigued by the prospect of a museum built around a social media-induced trend. The interactive museum opened in downtown Glendale on April 1, allowing the greater Los Angeles area to explore the history and art of the selfie phenomenon for $25.

In theory, the museum could have been interesting if executed properly. Unfortunately, however, the gallery is cheaply furnished and contains shockingly few installations beyond simple portrait art that is so generic it may as well have come from a Google search.
After paying for the overpriced admission ticket, patrons are given a selfie stick and told a brief history of selfies and the definition of a museum before being sent on their way to peruse the one-floor exhibit at their leisure. The pastel-colored blocks of wood that hold images depicting the history of the selfie are placed in the middle of the exhibit and surrounded by fun facts about selfies — including a factoid proving the Kardashian family did not start the selfie trend. 
In a side room, the exhibit displayed paintings by Vincent Van Gogh, including a replica of the room in which he created his famous self-portrait, other assorted portraits of individuals and statistics on selfies projected onto a television screen next to more pictures of selfies. In the same room is an explanation of the Greek myth of Narcissus, as well as a series of three Greco-Roman inspired statues posing as if they were snapping selfies.
Within the museum, there is an interactive section where visitors are encouraged to take selfies with popular selfie backgrounds. Backdrops included a makeshift bathroom (ironically situated adjacent to the actual bathrooms) with a model of the bathroom sink area. There is also  a replica of a gym where patrons can take selfies of themselves “working out,” as well as a bedazzled car parked in the corner of the gallery for selfies. 
Right past a blown-up picture of a skyline where visitors can take “selfies on a rooftop,” is a long selfie stick that runs from the back of the museum to the front. At the end of the tour is a gift shop, that offers Museum of Selfie merchandise at a price almost as absurdly high as the entry fee. 
The Museum of Selfies is, frankly, a waste of 30 minutes and a great way to throw away money. Not only were the museum’s pieces poorly created and presented, but they also lacked creativity and originality. The entire experience was disappointing and frustrating, to say the least, and the museum is not worth a visit.
The Museum of Selfies will be open in Glendale until May 31.

Growing up, Indian food was a mainstay in my household — I considered it “normal,” because Indian food was all I knew. My family and I ate channa masala (curried garbanzo beans) and daal chawal (lentils with rice) regularly, and we sampled other cuisines only when we went to restaurants. 
But as I grew older, I began to distance myself from Indian food. My mom continued to cook it for dinner every night, but I would refuse to take it to school, instead opting for bland and cold sandwiches.
I told myself I disliked Indian food not because it wasn’t good, but because I no longer considered it “normal.” It wasn’t that anyone had ever mocked me for bringing Indian food to school — in fact, many of my friends were curious about the food and enjoyed tasting it. But for me, it marked another way that I was different from everyone else, along with my unusual name and uncommon skin color. 
But of those three insecurities,  what I ate was something I could control, and I wanted that part of my life to be normal. And normal meant peanut butter and jelly or cucumbers and cream cheese, even though I found the cold bread abysmal and the other ingredients mediocre at best. 
Unfortunately, my attitude toward Indian food persisted well into high school. Whenever there was an international food fair or potluck at school, I would force my mom to cook Swiss food (although she is 100 percent Indian, she was born and grew up in Zurich), instead of the Indian dishes that were more her specialty. Once, another Indian student made and gave everyone Indian sweets for the Hindu holiday Diwali, but I refused to take it because I had internalized its inherent abnormality. 
That changed when I listened to an episode of the podcast The Sporkful. Each week, host Dan Pashman takes a critical, deeply analytical look at how the nature of food and cuisine operates in interaction with society and culture. Pashman advertises the show as “not for foodies, it’s for eaters,” and the show features a fun yet educational and analytical look at food that everyone can relate to.
Pashman has done interviews with comedians like Hasan Minhaj and Marc Maron about their favorite foods and weird food habits, and conducts experiments, like a “coffee election” in a workplace to determine the best brand of office coffee.
But the most insightful episodes are the serious ones — where Pashman delves deep into the role food plays in issues of race and society. Pashman has produced episodes about the fine line between appreciating food from other cultures and appropriating it, episodes about dietary restrictions and religion and episodes about the surprisingly important role food played in the civil rights movement.

But the episodes that affected me most were part of a four-episode series called “Your Mom’s Food,” which looked into how families pass on their cultural eating habits from generation to generation. 
In one of the episodes, “Midwest Meets Masala,” the story revolves around a white American woman, Anne, who grew up eating chicken and burgers, and her husband, Sajan, an Indian vegetarian who grew up eating traditional Indian fare. 
Anne embraced Indian cuisine after marrying Sajan; she learned her mother-in-law’s recipes and became vegetarian. But Anne began to realize that as she became more engrossed in a meatless cuisine, she was neglecting the foods she grew up with, forgetting her own mother’s cooking. 
At one point during the episode, Anne’s mother asks, “You don’t miss the flavors you grew up with?” 
It struck a chord with me because I realized that by refusing to eat Indian food, I was hurting my mom in the same way — I was telling her that I didn’t want anything to do with her home cooking, that the countless hours she spent cooking daal and making roti (Indian flatbread) for me didn’t matter, even though deep down, I loved everything about Indian food, from the complex spices and unique flavors to the contrasting crispy textures of roti and softer textures of sabzi (curried vegetables). 
That feeling was solidified when I came to college, when my mom was no longer there to cook Indian food for me every night. The foods I refused to take to school and grudgingly ate at home became foods I missed eating. 
I found myself going out of my way to eat at Parkside on the days they featured Indian cuisine, and bought frozen channa masala and daal from Trader Joe’s to cook in my dorm room. It is not nearly as good as my mom’s food, but it’s a decent substitute. 
Now, when I go home, I look forward to eating the Indian dishes my mom makes, and helping her cook them. I wish I was able to bring them here and eat them for lunch every day, but I’m also glad that I’ve rediscovered my love for the food I was lucky enough to grow up with.

Selling out a Wednesday night show in advance doesn’t happen often. However, up-and-coming pop artist Marc E. Bassy did just that on a stop along his Gossip Columns Tour at El Rey Theatre in Hollywood. The concert featured a diverse lineup including openers Gianni Taylor and Rexx Life Raj, and a number of other surprise guests throughout the show. It was an exciting night with a variety of sounds and styles and a whole lot of love for the Bay Area showcased on the mainstage, with all three artists having ties to the region.
Photo of Marc E. Bassy by Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
The evening began with a few tracks from artist Gianni Taylor. Entering the stage in a matching two-piece ’90s-esque windbreaker jumpsuit, Taylor commanded the stage with his 6-foot 7-inch (he announced) stature. His sound lies somewhere in between R&B and hip-hop, slightly reminiscent of Sammy Adams. In an interesting twist, after his first song, Taylor welcomed to the stage his good friend Justin Escalona, a student at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. It seemed that Escalona and a couple of his friends were filming Taylor’s set, collecting B-roll for a potential music video.
Between sets, DJ Shellheart, a female DJ, kept the crowd entertained, which was a pleasant surprise in a musical genre typically dominated by men. Shellheart did an excellent job of warming up the crowd for her friend and colleague Rexx Life Raj, the second opener of the night. Rexx, as he is often known, and his crew brought more rap to the stage than Taylor’s set did, and gave several shoutouts to the Bay as their home and inspiration. For Rexx’s final song, he asked all of the fans who were there to see him to come to the front and center of the venue; he then hurdled over the barrier and serenaded his fans with “Moxie Java,” a track from his newest album Father Figure.
The evening’s headliner, Marc E. Bassy, made his debut behind the piano for a rendition of “Morning.” Bassy, like several of his comrades on this tour, has split a lot of his life between the Bay Area and Los Angeles, and dedicated songs to each city during his performance. It was obvious that the bulk of the crowd was there for Bassy and each song brought a new wave of excitement. The size and liveliness of the audience at El Rey reflected that of a sold-out show.
Members of the audience recognized songs he performed that they had heard from streaming services without realizing he was the artist. This is a common occurrence in an age when music apps like Spotify and Pandora create personalized playlists based on listeners’ preferences. 
After a few songs, Bassy took some time to talk about a recent trip to Utah that inspired a new song he wanted to write this summer. The trip led to the creation of a new single, “Main Chick,” which he noted will likely be released later in April. 
During the chat, Bassy also got a little political, echoing a sentiment common among the Bay Area rap crowd: “F-ck Donald Trump.” Bassy made no attempt to cover the YG song by the same name but did mention, “If anyone tells you that you shouldn’t be in America, come stay at my house,” drawing cheers from the diverse crowd. After playing “Heroine,” guest rapper KYLE crashed the stage for a performance of the duo’s “Plot Twist,” then a mashup of a few of KYLE’s recent songs including last summer’s hit “iSpy.”
Bassy closed the set with “Til I get Found,” but as per usual, that was not the true end of the show. After a few minutes of chanting following his departure, he returned to the stage for an encore. The women in the crowd went wild as Bassy removed his shirt and began to sing “Black Jeep.” The evening culminated in a sensual (read: still shirtless) performance of Bassy’s hit “Subway Car” from his 2016 album Groovy People. With the conclusion of the final song, the venue began to clear and the show felt truly complete.

With fewer than two weeks left of spring football, the USC Trojans held its 11th practice Thursday, with the team’s defense rattling the Trojans’ young quarterbacks. 
Senior cornerback Iman “Biggie” Marshall decided to come back to USC for one more season. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
Quarterback Competition
It was an on and off day for both redshirt freshman Jack Sears and redshirt sophomore Matt Fink. The two continued to make strides in competing to become former QB Sam Darnold’s successor. 
Both Sears and Fink missed key throws but were able to bounce back. Sears missed a deep target but responded with an excellent quarterback carry on the next play.
Fink had trouble early on, but later connected deep with redshirt sophomore wide receiver Josh Imatorbhebhe. 
Outside of positional drills, head coach Clay Helton worked the quarterback tandem through a number of accuracy and ball security drills. The quarterbacks were tasked with making plays on balls that were snapped too low or too high. 
Helton was stepping in for quarterbacks coach Bryan Ellis, who is absent on paternity leave. 
Both accuracy and ball security were issues during the 2017 season. Darnold tied for the Football Bowl Subdivision high with 22 turnovers last season. Across his 27 starts at USC, he was responsible for 22 interceptions and 21 fumbles. 
Defense dominates
As junior Michael Pittman, Jr. and redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns continue to battle to replace Deontay Burnett as USC’s top wide receiver target, redshirt sophomore Velus Jones, Jr. continued to insert himself into the conversation. 
Jones’ speed has made him a valuable target on quick release throws and it showed during practice.
Senior Tyler Petite was a popular target for quarterbacks during practice. Standing at 6’4” and weighing 250 pounds, Petite used his body to his advantage to break away from defenders during live drills. 
At the end of the day, it was the defense that truly shone throughout practice. The quarterbacks were under constant pressure and were picked off a few times. 
In one instance, senior outside linebacker Porter Gustin tipped a pass from Fink into the hands of redshirt freshman defensive lineman Jay Tufele. Tufele ran it all the way back with the entire defense joining him in celebration. 
The defense loudly called out plays and jawed at the offense for the remainder of practice.
Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast had plenty of praise for freshman outside linebacker Kana’i Mauga, whom Pendergast said has impressed the coaching staff all spring. 
“Kana’i is very consistent, he’s a conscientious player,” Pendergast said. “He does things the right way most of the time, and if he makes a mistake he recognizes it.”
Pendergast emphasized that Mauga is skilled enough to play as an inside linebacker or on the line of scrimmage, giving the team much- needed flexibility. 
Secondary shines
The cornerbacks, led by redshirt senior Ajene Harris and senior Iman Marshall, continued to make things difficult for the team’s quarterbacks. 
Jonathan Lockett, another redshirt senior, picked off Fink early in practice. The rest of the corps prevented deep balls and pushed receivers out of bounds.
“We’re a very competitive group,” Harris said. “We come out here with tremendous effort. We feel very confident about ourselves this year.”
As his collegiate career winds down, Harris has taken it upon himself to coach the next crop of cornerbacks. 
“When I was a younger guy, the older guys … took me and showed me the ropes,” Harris said. “It’s just my role to show the younger guys the ropes and continue to help them through this process.” 
Injury Notes
Redshirt freshman lineman Marlon Tuipulotu continued to work alone as he rehabs from a back injury. Pittman Jr. warmed up away from the team before rejoining the group for drills. 
Junior linebacker Jordan Iosefa will require surgery to repair cartilage. Iosefa suffered a knee injury during Tuesday’s practice and needed to be pulled. He is expected to be back by the start of summer workouts on June 1.

It’s been a frustrating season for USC baseball, despite the team boasting a 14-11 winning record. 
Sophomore infielder John Thomas has struggled with hitting, like the rest of the lineup. Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan
After capturing 11 of their first 17 games, the Trojans cooled off as they opened Pac-12 play. This has been especially prevalent in the lineup’s performance, which has simply not provided the pitching staff with the run support necessary to consistently win games against high-level competition. 
However, head coach Dan Hubbs and his staff hope that Tuesday’s 9-run road win against UC Santa Barbara wakes the bats up for the Trojans, as the team enters the last two months of the season starting with this weekend’s series at Arizona State. 
Arizona State, at 13-16, is another middling team, similar to USC. The Sun Devils don’t get too high or too low; their longest win and loss streaks stand at three. Both teams have little reputation for playing well against top teams; the only top-25 competition they’ve faced was UCLA, both losing two out of a three-game series. The Sun Devils are coming off two straight losses to Cal State Fullerton earlier this week. This should be a well-matched series between two squads struggling to find consistency. 
Arizona State’s greatest strength is hitting. The Sun Devils rank fourth in the Pac-12 with a .292 batting average and are second in the conference with 22 home runs. They also have a .436 slugging percentage, ranking behind only California and Oregon State.
Arizona State receives contributions from the entire lineup, but there are two hitters who stand out. First is freshman infielder Spencer Torkelson, who is hitting .284 and has 14 home runs on the year, tied for most in the conference. Torkelson is liable to go yard on any pitch. Unsurprisingly, Torkelson’s .743 slugging percentage is second in the Pac-12.
The other star is outfielder Gage Canning, whose .431 batting average ranks second in the conference. He sits right behind Torkelson with a .740 slugging percentage, since he leads the Pac-12 in doubles (11) and triples (9). Aside from the two stars, the Sun Devils have five other hitters with double-digit RBIs in 2018, so the Trojan pitching staff will be in for a tall order in Tempe.
The Sun Devils are dangerous at the plate, but their lackluster record is due in part to their irregular pitching performances. Arizona State has a solid starter in Eli Lingos, who is 5-1 with a 2.02 ERA and 44 strikeouts. Other than Lingo, they have no consistent starters with ERAs below 2.93. The team has given up the second most earned runs in the conference (120), due to a lack of bullpen depth.
One key to look for in the ASU-USC series is walks. Arizona State has walked 123 batters in 2018, most in the Pac-12. USC, while not ranking very high in walks, is known to be patient at the plate. If the Trojans keep a good eye, they could score runs without needing to smack the ball around.
Arizona State’s biggest weakness is fielding. They rank last in the Pac-12 in fielding percentage and first in errors and stolen bases against. They have two fielders with five errors and three with six. Similar to Arizona State’s propensity to walk batters, USC might not have to do much to win the series.

Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
When I wrote my column previewing the Los Angeles Dodgers’ 2018 season last week, I didn’t even consider discussing the “other” L.A. team based less than an hour southeast in Anaheim. In my mind, there wasn’t much to discuss: The Angels haven’t made the playoffs in four years, and a combination of injuries and ill-advised contracts have mired them in mediocrity since Josh Hamilton’s third and final ill-fated campaign with the Halos what feels like an eternity ago.
In retrospect, it was a blatant oversight on my part. One week into baseball’s new year, Anaheim and rookie sensation Shohei Ohtani have stolen the show, already rendering the defending National League champion Dodgers an afterthought.
Of course, we are seven games into the Major League Baseball season (for what it’s worth, the Angels are 5-2, one game out of the lead in the AL West). Proportionally speaking, that’s like being midway through the third quarter in Week 1 of the NFL. A team that “steals the show” this week could easily finish 2018 with the worst record in the league. A player who looks bound for a career year could be in Triple-A by next month.
Nevertheless, it’s difficult to overstate the impressiveness of Ohtani’s introduction in Anaheim. This isn’t to say that the 23-year-old will prove to be an elite, big-league player, but considering the expectations that accompanied the two-way hitting pitcher from Japan over the offseason, it’s remarkable that Ohtani has emerged from his first week in the majors with a 1-0 record and six hits in 14 at-bats.
Ohtani was always going to face unrealistic expectations after arriving stateside bearing the label “Japan’s Babe Ruth.” But there was a reason for the hype: He debuted in NPB as a teenager, the Japanese big leagues (widely considered the strongest league in the world outside MLB), and quickly established himself as one of the best pitchers in the country — who also hit for a career .286 mark. Ohtani was named MVP when he was 21, mashing at a .322 clip with 22 home runs while also compiling a 10-4 record on the mound alongside a 1.86 ERA.
The two-way potential had pretty much everyone in the U.S. — scouts, coaches, executives and fans alike — salivating. There hasn’t been a dominant pitcher-hitter since the Bambino himself, and even Ruth gave up pitching to focus on his bat when he was 25 (he toed the rubber in a total of five times after 1919).
That’s why it was surreal to watch Ohtani club a game-tying 2-run home run off of reigning Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber on Wednesday. It was the rookie’s second dinger in as many days, off one of the game’s filthiest aces, no less. Ohtani’s two-for-five day at the plate actually lowered his average to .429 across four games.
By the way, this performance came three days after Ohtani debuted as a pitcher, picking up the win with six innings of 3-run ball against the Oakland A’s. He flashed a dazzling repertoire, including a fastball that hit triple digits as well as a wicked splitter. All the damage against Ohtani came on a 3-run homer in the second inning, after which he didn’t allow another hit.
There is a question of durability, however. Swinging the bat between starts will likely be a significant challenge for Ohtani: The majors’ five-man starting staff has already historically caused fatigue issues for Japanese imports, who are used to playing on a six-pitcher, once-per-week rotation. Ohtani will have to adjust to making around 30 starts a year instead of 20 and grinding through a 162-game schedule instead of Japan’s 144-game campaign.
But if Ohtani can stay healthy to be an all-around asset throughout the season, his versatility could truly give the Angels an edge. At the very least, his days slotting in as designated hitter will give his team additional depth pinch-hitting and for defensive replacements. Maybe Ohtani’s bat even allows Anaheim to forgo an extra bench player in favor of carrying another bullpen arm — a magnified advantage come the postseason. After wallowing in irrelevance for years, Angels fans must surely be dreaming of playoff baseball now that their team’s gamble appears to have paid off.
The whole experiment almost went off the rails before the start of the season, too, when Ohtani endured an absolutely atrocious Spring Training. His 27.00 ERA and .107 mark at the dish sparked discussion that the Angels’ 20 million dollar man could begin the year in the minors. It was likely Ohtani’s price tag that kept him on the big-league roster. Ironically, Anaheim’s reluctance to bury its multimillion-dollar investment in the farm system opened the door for the past week’s unprecedented breakout.
Will Ohtani develop into a uniquely elite weapon not seen in baseball for a century? Or will he ditch one trade to focus on his strength, just as Babe Ruth did? Perhaps he will merely prove to be a novelty item, quickly forgotten after he fails to adapt to the big leagues. But none of those questions matter in 2018. For now, we can simply enjoy “Sho-Time” while it lasts — an audacious stunt once reserved for video games and a bygone era now playing out in front of our eyes.

In the midst of the Final Four last week, NCAA President Mark Emmert shared some strong takes about why college athletes should not be paid. Specifically, he argued that if they had to pay male athletes, they would also have to pay female athletes. And then he said that if they were to pay athletes in revenue sports — football and men’s basketball — that would require them to eliminate other sports to compensate.
First of all, regardless of which gender of athletes is being paid, the fundamental issue remains whether athletes should be paid at all. Let’s settle that argument before using Title IX as a shield.
And to Emmert’s second point, there are certainly ways to work around cutting sports to compensate athletes. The most popular solution is the Olympic model, where athletes are not paid to compete in the Olympics, but can be given prize money by their National Olympic Committees for medaling and — most importantly — receive money through sponsorships and advertisements.
That is a model the NCAA can easily adopt without sacrificing whatever “sanctity” it believes it holds. Emmert has argued that paying athletes would mean entering them into an employer-employee relationship with their schools. But letting athletes profit off themselves does not enter them into any kind of contract with the NCAA. It is a viable, middle-ground approach that allows athletes to make whatever the market dictates but does not wade into the issue of how much of a stipend each individual athlete or sport should receive.
This way, the star football player can sign a deal with Nike or Adidas for a significant sum of money, while the lesser-known rower or the wrestler can also find a sponsor for perhaps less money — but it’s still money, and it’s fair, according to the market. Everybody wins.
It makes so much sense — way too much sense for this institution to adopt.
Instead, Emmert and his cohort stick to their hard-lined, backwards facade of amateurism, while they do things like bringing in Kendrick Lamar to sing at halftime of the National Championship Game. If the NCAA wants to put on a show, it should reward rather than restrict the very athletes who make that show possible.
Case in point: Katie Ledecky, the five-time gold medal swimmer who won America’s heart in Rio. She’s been swimming at Stanford for the past two years, but, last week, decided to give up her college career after her sophomore season to turn professional and chase endorsements. Ledecky will remain enrolled in school and train at Stanford, but can no longer compete in the NCAA. She could not give up any more of her prime athletic years while not making a dime.
But that decision, in and of itself, is a shame. Ledecky should not have to choose between making money and competing in college. It’s a lose-lose situation: She has to leave her team and the NCAA is deprived of the best female swimmer on the planet.
Meanwhile, Ledecky is gearing up for the Tokyo Games in 2020 by signing with Wasserman, a powerhouse sports agency. That is allowed under the Olympic model, and it will undoubtedly get her paid her worth as a world-renowned athlete.
By plugging its ears to this practical solution, the NCAA is only hurting itself. Players are sitting out bowl games because they don’t want to get hurt in a meaningless game and not even get paid for it. More and more star players are encouraged to leave school early, because staying an extra year or two could mean sustaining a career-ending injury — and zero compensation. Last year’s NBA Draft saw the most “one-and-dones” ever picked in the first round. At USC, former quarterback and potential top pick Sam Darnold declared for the NFL Draft with two years of eligibility left in college, and one has to believe the potential for injury played a role in that decision.
As we enjoy March Madness and college football and everything else that comes with athletics at this level, it’s important to remember that players drive sports. Without Loyola-Chicago’s players, Sister Jean would not be famous. Players play the sports, they create the moments, and they make the memories; they should be paid as such.

The USC men’s volleyball team plays No. 14 Grand Canyon University Friday evening.
Redshirt junior outside hitter Jack Wyett jumps to go for the kill. Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
The team is coming off its biggest win of the season, with a down-to-the-wire 3-2 victory over crosstown rival UCLA on Senior Night. 
Coming into the game, UCLA was the No. 3 team in the nation riding a five-game win streak. Meanwhile, USC had just lost two games straight to UC Irvine and Pepperdine, respectively, two schools the Bruins had defeated. However, the Trojans took head coach Jeff Nygaard’s comments to heart about trusting the process and honoring their four seniors: setter Gert Lisha, outside hitter Jack Wyett, opposite hitter Jon Rivera and middle blocker Conor Inlow. As a former Olympian himself, Nygaard made sure to give every senior the reverence he knows they deserve, inserting Rivera into the starting lineup alongside the three other seniors. The rest of the players did their part in respecting their graduating teammates. 
Junior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso had 20 kills, two aces and two blocks while hitting .441 to lead the Trojans, while freshman middle blocker Sam Lewis added ten kills and five blocks. Usual starting opposite hitter Ryan Moss came off the bench to record nine kills, one ace and two blocks. It was Nygaard’s first victory over his alma mater, where he was a two-time National College Player of the Year in the mid-1990s, in six games.
Meanwhile, Grand Canyon is coming off an easy 3-0 win against Benedictine University at Mesa on their own Senior Night for GCU’s nine graduating players. Their senior class is arguably the most important in the program’s brief history to date (GCU became the first for-profit university to participate in NCAA D-I athletics in 2004). Some of their accomplishments include reaching the 2017 MIVA finals, remaining in the top 15 for every week of this season, and compiling the best four-year win total in program history. Senior outside hitter Shalev Saada led the Lopes with 14 kills and seven digs on a .524 hitting percentage. Senior setters Puna Kaniho and Zachary Melcher split time, with Melcher leading GCU with two aces and 23 assists, while Kaniho drew the start and recorded 11 assists. All in all, Grand Canyon head coach Matt Werle made sure to play every single one of his seniors as a testament to all they have contributed to the program’s remarkable success over the past four years.
For GCU, this will be their final game of the season, while USC has one more at Concordia University in Irvine after playing GCU. Now with a 7-17 record on the year, including a 3-7 record in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play, the Trojans look to build upon the momentum of the Senior Night festivities with two strong wins over two ranked schools. Both games have playoff implications in terms of USC’s seed.
According to the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation website, USC would clinch the MPSF Tournament’s No. 4 seed and quarterfinal home court with two wins this week.
If USC splits the games, they will need to beat Concordia and lose to GCU. This is the only way that USC could earn the four seed in a possible four-way tie when factoring in Stanford — if the Cardinal wins once this week.
If the Trojans, Eagles, Antelopes and Cardinal all finish with four MPSF wins, they would all have a 3-3 record in matches against each other. If USC wins 3-0 against CUI and loses 3-2 vs. GCU, USC’s set record vs. the tied teams would be 14-12 for the highest percentage within that tied group.
Essentially, the Trojans can control their own destiny by securing victories in their two remaining matches; a single win or two losses makes things a bit more complicated. Regardless of what happens, it will be very interesting to see on Friday night if USC has finally flipped the switch on during this rollercoaster of a season.

The Trojan track and field team comes into the week off a pair of impressive performances at the Power 5 Trailblazer Challenge and the California Collegiate Invitational the past two weekends. The outdoor season is now well underway as the Pac-12 championships, starting on May 5, are fast approaching. The team will be gearing up for the Sun Angel Challenge in Tempe, Ariz. this coming weekend.
Sophomore distance runner Joshua Zavala and the USC Track and Field team have had a solid 2018 season. Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
USC took home 12 victories at the Trailblazer Challenge, all on the second day of competition. The men’s and women’s squads split the wins evenly, securing six apiece. 
Sophomore Michael Norman continued his dominant streak, following up his record breaking performance in the 400m dash last month with a win in the 200m sprints with a time of 20.37. He and his teammates, freshman Zach Shinnick sophomore Alexander Barnum and senior Ricky Morgan Jr., once again dominated the 4x100m, blazing a 38.88, the fourth fastest time by a Trojan quartet. Morgan Jr. picked up another win in the men’s 400m race, where he ran a time of 46.34. Barnum also got an individual victory, winning the men’s 100m dash on a time of 10.36. Senior Robert Ford also secured a relatively easy victory in the men’s 800m race on a time of 1:48.97.
The women’s 4×100 team impressed as well, winning on a time of 43.18 run by redshirt juniors Dior Hall and Ky Westbrook, senior Deanna Hill and freshman Twanisha Terry. Terry also won the women’s 100m dash, posting a remarkable time of 10.97, followed narrowly by Hill’s second place time of 10.98. USC secured a victory in the women’s 200m dash as well, with senior Kendall Ellis running a time of 23.07. Sophomore Anna Cockrell took first in the women’s 100m hurdles on a time of 13.02, wrapping up a big day that she opened by performing the national anthem.
Redshirt senior Breana Jemison won the women’s shot put with a best distance of 55-5.50, securing a narrow victory by just two inches. Redshirt junior Alexa Harmon took first in the women’s high jump, clearing 5-8.00 for her best jump of the season. 
Despite the absence of senior Randall Cunningham, the Trojans earned a victory in the men’s high jump as well with freshman Earnest Sears III clearing 7-0.25 to win the event. 
Terry and Norman were each awarded Pac-12 Track Athlete of the Week for their impressive performances at the meet.
The Trojans sent a much smaller delegation to the California Collegiate Invitational the following weekend, with only the throwers and a few jumpers attending. Nonetheless, they managed to pick up three victories over the course of the meet. 
Jemison set a USC record in the women’s shot put, also taking with a throw of 51-8.25. Redshirt senior Nick Ponzio also won in the shot put for the men’s team, throwing for 59-9.50 to win the event. Freshman Cassidy Palka took first in the women’s high jump with a clearance of 5-6.0. 
The Trojans are now preparing for next weekend’s Sun Angel Challenge in Tempe, where they will face other Pac-12 schools. Temperatures at the meet are expected to be in the 90s, the highest temperature the Trojan’s will have had to compete in so far this season. They will look to fight both the heat and the competition as championship season rolls closer.

The USC women’s beach volleyball team lost 2-3 to their crosstown rivals UCLA Wednesday night. The Women of Troy were coming off a tough loss against Pepperdine.

The matches opened up on the 5th court, where the USC senior duo Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer took on UCLA junior Izzy Carey and freshman Megan Muret. Early on, the veteran duo Belton and Kremer showed why they were labeled by the USC’s coaches as “the group you can leave alone,” by going up 17-13 early on in the first set.
However, the lead would be short-lived as Muret and Carey would use an 8-3 run to steal the first set from USC. UCLA would carry on the momentum from the first set, going up 11-6 early on in the second set, and dominantly finished the game 21-10 to earn UCLA its first point of the match.
On court four, junior Katrina Kernochan and graduate student Alexandra Poletto took on UCLA freshman Mac May, a former Gatorade player of the year, and senior Elisa Zappia. After falling behind early in the first set 4-8, the Kernochan and Poletto duo fought back to bring it to 11-11. 
Kernochan and Poletto used their size as an advantage — using high shots to keep the defense off balance. Despite taking a timeout with the score at 17-18, May and Zappia would use a 3-1 run to close out the first set. 
In a highly competitive second set, UCLA continued to attack the 5-foot-9 Kernochan, stuffing her at the net multiple times. Despite that, USC seized a 17-14 lead behind Poletto’s proficiency near the net. Though UCLA had a 4-0 run to tie the second set at 19 a piece, Kernochan closed it out to win 21-19 and force a third set. In the decisive third set, May and Zappia used powerful shots and a 6-1 run to open up 9-5. With all of the momentum on the Bruins’ side, Kernochan dominated the next few points to tie it at 12-12. Poletto and Kernochan were unable to close the deal and fell 14-16 off of May’s kill.
On the second court, senior Terese Cannon and freshman Sammy Slater were also unable to get any momentum going for USC, losing the first set 15-21. They fought back hard in the second set to go up 12-11. Despite their efforts,  sophomore Lily Justine and junior Sarah Sponcil came back to win 21-17, and seal the overall win for UCLA.
With USC behind 0-3 and the match decided, the Women of Troy would turn to their No. 1 pair of freshman Tina Graudina and junior Abril Bustamante to win a game as they faced off against UCLA’s twins Nicole and Megan McNamara. The McNamara twins, who were riding a 16-game winning streak, showed their dominance by going up on USC 9-16 early in the first set and closing it out 16-21. The McNamaras were noticeably sloppier in the second set, and USC capitalized winning the second set 21-17. In the competitive third set, Graudina and Bustamante won 16-14 to get USC its first victory. Graudina, has stepped in as an immediate contributor for USC and she has reaped high praise from the coaches. Assistant coach Dain Blanton told the Pac-12 Network that he “wouldn’t be surprised” if Graudina was to be selected to represent Latvia in the 2020 Olympic Games.
The dual would be finished with sophomore Joy Dennis and freshman Haley Hallgren taking on the reigning Pac-12 pair of the week, Savvy Simo and Zana Muno. They came out strong against the streaking pair, winning 21-19 in the first set. Dennis and Hallgren came out swinging again in the second set jumping on the Bruins 6-1, but Simo and Muno fought back to take the second set 17-21. USC at least took the third set 15-8, but ended the match with a loss.
With Wednesday’s 3-2 victory, UCLA has now won two out of three duals against USC in 2018. 
Up next, the Women of Troy will welcome Pepperdine on April 10 at 5 p.m. The game will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.

There are only a few weeks left in the spring semester, which means it’s time to focus on finals, make summer plans and find an internship. That means constantly refreshing Indeed.com, waiting on emails from Human Resources departments for multiple eternities and wearing business-professional more than ever. But it will be worth it when you get the internship, right? After all, research consistently shows that students who graduate with internship experience perform better in the post-grad job market, and many entry-level jobs highly prefer internship experience. It seems that at least one internship is a requirement for the post-recession college graduate, and the more internships, the better for job prospects.
Madeline Landry | Daily Trojan
The issue is that many of these internships are unpaid, which is immoral on two levels: Unpaid internships devalue student labor and also discourage class mobility. It is time to retire the model of unpaid internships and give interns a living wage.
The unpaid internship has gained popularity in the 10 years since the economic crash and resulting recession of 2008, and the practice is especially prevalent in fields like media, politics and fashion. The U.S. Department of Labor defines an internship as an educational program that provides practical experience to beginners for a limited, agreed-upon amount of time, and states that a for-profit company can offer unpaid internships if they provide the intern with “beneficial learning” and do not give the intern responsibilities that would otherwise be done by a paid employee. These regulations are loosely defined and even more loosely regulated, and speaking from anecdotal evidence, many unpaid internships masquerade as learning opportunities while really being free labor from eager college students.
Here we get into the economic issue of valuing what one pays for; if an intern is essentially a volunteer who can, at best, add to a company’s value, or at worst, take up an extra chair in the office, why would their employer be interested in their work or professional development? They offer no economic risk, so the company feels no need to ensure that their work is good. Meanwhile, interns are taking an immense economic risk by giving up the time they could have spent at a paying job in hopes of exposure or connections with an employer that most likely does not care about them and their needs.
Of course, every internship varies in its requirements, schedule and level of intensity. And the main goal of any internship is, ostensibly, to learn. But this model is outdated and all too easily exploited by employers. Most importantly, the proliferation and growing expectation around unpaid internships is systematically pricing out low and middle-income students from the prestigious careers they desire.
A brief example: A student wants to work in the film industry. He or she was accepted to USC, worked hard in class for two years and is now looking at summer internships. But to pay for rent and food in Los Angeles, where many of these internships are located, they need a few thousand dollars. Here they have a choice: get an internship, take out a loan and hope that it benefits their career down the road, or get a paying job. The job would most likely be unrelated to their career goals and pay minimum wage, but if they cannot afford to spend a summer leaking money, they may not have much of a choice.
Millions of students from low-income (meaning “do not have four thousand dollars laying around”) families are faced with this predicament every spring, and it makes sense that many of them choose to take a job at a coffee shop or summer camp instead of pursuing the internship, because it is simply not economically feasible. Surely, some students can make it work, finding a balance between paying work and an unpaid internship or finding an internship that offers a stipend, but these examples are rare and do not invalidate the brokenness of the unpaid internship system.
The individual choices — to offer internships without pay, to require internship experience for entry-level jobs and to not consider the economic needs of poor and middle-class students — all add up to give yet another advantage to wealthier students. Because they do not have to worry about making living costs for themselves over the summer, they can easily take unpaid internships, and when the time comes for job applications, they will have the most impressive resumes. Of course an employer would choose a candidate with three completed internships over one with three summers’ worth of minimum wage food service or retail work. But securing internships is not necessarily a sign of competency or talent; it is, more than anything, a signal of economic privilege.
If the trend of unpaid internships continues, young professionals from low and middle-income families may be effectively priced out of the fields that they worked hard in school to join. This will only add to the existing homogeneity of creative and political fields, which can damage our media and policy for an entire generation. Neglecting to pay interns may seem like an inconsequential economic choice, but it is incredibly impactful, and it is time for companies to recognize that impact and make a change.

Kylie Cheung | Daily Trojan
Last week, Walmart’s decision to pull Cosmopolitan magazines from its checkout lines marked the latest development in an ongoing trend of confusing women’s sexual empowerment with objectification. But the quasi-censorship of a magazine that acknowledges what far too many sources of media fail to — that women are more than objects in the act of sex, and actually enjoy it — reflects a key piece of the age-old objectification versus empowerment debate that is too often missed. Specifically, when women make fully autonomous decisions about their bodies and sexuality, that is always a mark of empowerment.
To deny women access to displays or dialogues regarding female sexuality is to suggest that female sexuality is always oppressive and objectifying. Walmart’s latest decision, which cites #MeToo’s struggle against the objectification of women, is just paternalism and sexual policing at its most insidious.
We’ve encountered many examples of the phenomenon of women’s pleasure being regarded as either tangential or perverted. Think of movies like Blue Valentine, Two Girls and a Guy and other films doomed to commercial disappointment by NC-17 ratings handed down by the Motion Picture Association of America for featuring women receiving, rather than giving, oral sex. Think of the United Nations being forced by the perenially angry anti-porn mob to rescind an honorary ambassadorship it extended to Wonder Woman in 2016. (The object of the mob’s outrage was, predictably enough, the intergalactic heroine’s revealing state of dress). And yet, the phenomenon of scantily clad heroines, especially in media catered to male audiences, generally speaks to the issue of women’s underrepresentation and a need for women to be accorded greater decision-making power, rather than anything inherently wrong with sexual women, or women who choose to wear revealing clothing.
Female sexuality is invariably about power dynamics, and in the age of #MeToo, our understandings of consent and women’s role in sex must adapt with the times. Notably, a 2016 survey conducted by a Middlesex University professor found a distinct majority of women respondents preferred gay male to heterosexual porn. Professor Lucy Neville explained in an interview with PsyPost that “the invisibility of female pleasure” and exploitation of women in porn guided many female respondents’ preferences. Heterosexual pornography’s inherent prioritzation of male pleasure and the male gaze is something a lot of women clearly take issue with. And it’s not just porn. Misrepresentation of female sexuality is systemic and has real-world consequences.
A controversial report earlier this year detailed a young woman’s sexual encounter with actor and feminist writer Aziz Ansari, in which she claims Ansari persisted in soliciting sexual acts from her despite her mix of verbal and nonverbal rejections. Responses to the report showed how #MeToo has sparked critical, thoughtful dialogue not only about sexual abuse, but also about our general understandings of consent. Our exposure to real, authentic female pleasure and female perspectives about consensual sex is severely limited because female sexuality is so widely censored — either by puritanical erasure of female pleasure in media, or by male-led narratives and productions that prioritize representations of male pleasure. And as a result, women’s experiences and consent — or lack thereof — are being dangerously ignored in the real world. 
From disgraced Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, to Ansari and other famous men accused of similarly controversial acts, in each case, there’s something to be said about how these men regarded women’s desires as entirely irrelevant to their own. This mindset has always more or less been the norm, although not always to the extent of assault, and it’s magazines like Cosmo that have been slashing through this persistent inequality in recent years. 
Cosmo’s content is constantly informing the public that women’s experiences in sex do, in fact, matter. The magazine consistently gives women candid guides on how to enjoy sex, which they aren’t getting from more traditional media, and certainly aren’t getting from heterosexual porn. In the age of #MeToo, it’s become increasingly clear that our lack of respect for and honest portrayals of female sexuality have real consequences.
Contrary to Walmart’s reasoning for removing Cosmo from checkout lines, the magazine is an important part of how we must address #MeToo. That is, through understanding that sex isn’t just about men. And if we aren’t teaching women that it’s their right to enjoy sex as much as it is men’s, then we’re encouraging a culture in which women’s experiences in sexual acts are sidelined, and holding the door open for women’s exploitation.

This Thursday, the electrifying duo known as Brasstracks will bring its sound to Hollywood’s Roxy Theater, filling the air with blaring trumpets and relentless percussion. It’s the latest stop on the group’s  cross-country For Those Who Know tour, which has already sold out venues in San Francisco, New York and other markets before coming to a close in Denver next week.
Brasstracks is made up of Ivan Jackson on the trumpet and Conor Rayne on the drums. The two studied together at the Manhattan School of Music and eventually decided to create together as a group, a dream that became much more tangible once their Lido-assisted cover of Rihanna’s “Four Five Seconds” made them a name to watch on SoundCloud. Since then, they’ve kept themselves busy through collaborations with artists like Chance the Rapper, Anderson .Paak and Khalid, elevating their own profile in the process.
In the live setting, though, the two work in tandem, and have settled into complementary roles that make the performances as smooth as possible.
Photo from Facebook
“[Conor] will be holding everything down, he’s the anchor that pushes everything forward,” Jackson said. “While he’s doing that, I’m looking into the crowd, and I’m like, ‘Where is the crowd going with this?’ We’ll notice different things in Vancouver than Seattle, and in Seattle we notice different things from Boston; Conor’s internalizing things in a certain way, and I’m looking at things from an external point of view.”
As the two ensure they touch base on their respective experiences after every show, they say their communication has improved as a result of all the time they’ve spent together on the road. Jackson said he and Rayne differ in many ways with regard to personalities and music tastes. Over time, though, they’ve learned how to better voice their feelings and frustrations when it comes to creating music, resulting in a stronger, more authentic final product.
“Communicating about where we’re at, that’s the biggest thing; creatively, where we’re unhappy, and where we want to go,” Rayne said. “But also, at every show, we’ve gotten almost a sold-out crowd, which is really cool to see. We’re thinking about how to keep that sound and keep our audiences happy and interested, but also keep thinking about the next step and pushing forward.”
Currently, Brasstracks is in the process of releasing its two-part EP, the first of which, “For Those Who Know Pt. 1,” dropped in October. Containing features from Robert Glasper, The Underachievers and S’Natra (who will also be performing at their Thursday show in Los Angeles), the duo sought to make a project they felt was more reflective of their personalities, borrowing much from their hometown of New York City and incorporating it into the sound.
“We wanted to create a project that was much more true to us, in a lot of ways,” Jackson said. “It was way more New York City, and it took a lot more from our roots, like the music that we really do appreciate, and hadn’t been capitalizing on.”
Bringing the music of “For Those Who Know Pt. 1” to the stage is always a joy for the duo, tying into their process of recording songs in the studio. Jackson and Rayne say that each environment is essential to the success of the other, allowing them to find new discoveries and further develop their overall artistry.
“If you’re in a good place, and you’re able to a flow on stage and try out new things, you can learn a lot and bring that information to the studio,” Rayne said. “Vice versa, making beats in the studio is all about restrictions, and trying to not insert yourself while leaving space for the music. Then when you’re playing live, you’re like, ‘oh, all this space worked in the studio, let me try and leave some space on stage as well. It’s a really symbiotic relationship.”

Springfest 2018 is fast approaching, and it’s impossible to talk about the highly anticipated event without mentioning last year’s debacle with rap group Migos. A result of too many attendees, the unexpected shutdown shook the campus — headliner Rae Sremmurd never even took stage. I vividly remember watching the night unfold through my Snapchat feed which was flooded with stories of students scrambling to find alternative plans for the night. At the time, I wasn’t even a USC student and did not attend the event for myself.
Instead, I was taking a break from LA Hacks at a nearby Roscoe’s with a friend at USC when he exclaimed, “Oh sh-t! Migos just got shut down!” We returned to campus to work on our project, and I overheard people talking with my friends about it. Energized by their enthusiasm, I deliberately began to overinflate  my personal connection to it. Over the next few weeks, I created a Spotify playlist titled “Springfest” that was filled with Migos and Rae Sremmurd songs (and I haven’t updated it since). When I visited USC a month later, I noted that a Sigma Phi Delta party coincidentally shut down when the DJ played a Migos song, and I took pride in making the connection. I even indirectly mentioned Springfest in a Daily Nexus article, needlessly bragging to my then school UCSB about my familiarity with the event.
This wasn’t the first or only time I’ve displayed this kind of “school spirit,” though. When I buy groceries at USC Village, I flaunt my “Festival of Books” bag instead of bringing the new USC-branded reusable Trader Joe’s bag to show that I attended the event at USC last year. I remember visiting the campus when the “Finger Fountain” was still here and having a Big Alaska ice cream bar from EVK. I consider one of my T-shirts to be emblematic of my school pride  because it was doused in blue paint at a party on Menlo Ave.
I’ve had this “I’m so cool because I knew USC when I didn’t go there” mentality for two and a half years now, and I understand why it would annoy others. It’s a hollow expression of posturing — essentially when people think they know more about a topic than they actually do and shove it in other’s faces. Despite the irritating mentality I’ve held the past few years, there is a reason behind this persona.

Throughout the college application season, I was unsure where I wanted to spend the next four years of my life. During a trip to Los Angeles, however, I spontaneously contacted two former high school peers who were about to start their freshman years at USC. This unexpectedly sparked hangouts at home and visits to campus, during which they exposed me to the ins and outs of student life and facts about the school. With each meetup, my interest in attending USC and passion for the school grew stronger. Realistically, USC seemed almost as unlikely to accept me as UC Berkeley or Harvard, but the developing friendships I’d made sparked an interest so immense that the odds didn’t matter to me.
After my freshman year application and appeal were both rejected, all seemed lost. However, hope reignited after I heard that two other friends were transferring to USC for their sophomore year. While I was in this state of limbo, awaiting my chance to follow their footsteps, I took every possible opportunity to visit the University so I had as many chances to soak in the campus atmosphere as possible. Whenever I was in Los Angeles, the experiences I valued most were the unplanned visits to USC that came with it (as well as a night spent at The Lorenzo). Truly, I loved every single minute spent on campus, even when I was doing nothing, because all that mattered was that I was spending time there.
My passion for USC and all the knowledge I acquired were to prove that I was a worthy student. None of my family members were alumni, so I wanted to prove to others (and more importantly, myself) that I truly cared about this school. To make up for what I perceived to be disadvantages elsewhere, I wanted to show that I was full of energy and love for the school. Looking back, I forced myself to love this University more, but for good reason. The community I developed because of my growing interest made me feel included when I wasn’t an actual student.
But now, I am officially a student. And for me to think that I could be a Trojan simply based on the few trivialities I knew about the University, such as what happened at Springfest last year, is pitiful in retrospect. When I walk past Dean’s List or El Huero, I can reminisce about the good times I had on campus as a non-student, but those times weren’t what made me a Trojan. I’m grateful that many new experiences as a student at this school intensified my desire to attend it in the first place. However, as proud as I should be for these personal reasons, it does not give me the right to excessively brag about knowing said attributes before I was officially a Trojan. I should look forward to the memories I will make during my time here instead of obsessively looking back on those I created before becoming a student. I’ve made it in, now, and that’s all that matters.

“If you don’t like break-up songs, this show is not for you,” declared the 26-year-old, Los Angeles-based songstress and USC alumna Rozzi Crane to her adoring audience Tuesday at the Peppermint Club. Singing to a crowd of well-dressed 20-somethings and a grandpa decked in his best Rozzi merch, she played an intimate 45 minute set, filled with acoustic versions of her hits and newer songs. 
Rozzi’s performance at the Peppermint Club Tuesday night was raw, intimate and stripped down. Olivia de Witt | Daily Trojan
Rozzi told the audience the story behind each song she performed, giving insight into her life and musical career while creating a bond between her and her listeners through these personal anecdotes. Along with her three-piece band and two back-up singers, she opened the show with one of her new songs “66 Days,” telling the audience she had written the song “exactly 66 days after a break-up.” Rozzi sang the first  verse on her own without musical accompaniment, before the full band entered all at once for the chorus in true rock n’ roll fashion, hyping the audience with its beat and catchy tune. 
Rozzi switched up the dynamic of the band as the evening progressed, going from full band, to just her voice and guitar, to her voice with piano and drums, as well as other arrangements. While introducing the band, she explained her guitarist and back-up vocalist were also USC alums, having been with Rozzi since her days at Thornton. 
Whether it’s writing about her break-ups, her friends’ break-ups or even writing to uplift others, Rozzi’s songwriting and lyrical ability were obvious in her sold-out show. Many of Rozzi’s songs had a theme of heartbreak in both relationships and the music industry, but, toward the end of her set, she presented a song called “Two Minutes,” a female empowerment track she wrote after the 2016 election. Later in her set, she performed a stripped back cover of Charlie Puth’s “Attention” and performed an unreleased, somber song (which she sang and played on the piano) called “Bad Together,” which she says she started writing while smoking a joint after a bad breakup. 
 Not only is Rozzi a talented songwriter, but she is also a natural born performer. If she was nervous, no one in the crowd could tell. She looked like she was at complete ease and moved about the stage with poise and confidence. Even when she experienced the expected mess-ups that come with playing live, Rozzi played the incidents off easily. She even acknowledged a mistake on her recent hit “Uphill Battle,” caused by the surreality of watching the audience sing along to her lyrics, which resulted in her joyously restarting the song. 
When you watch Rozzi perform, her passion for what she does is clear. Her show was entertaining, and her songs stuck in audiences’ heads long after they left the venue and into the next day. She is talented, impressive and can easily win over a crowd, especially in her ability to relate to her audience. Rozzi’s performance at the Peppermint Club was seamless, showcasing the singer as an exceptional vocalist with promise to reach pop stardom. Her album will be coming out later this year, and you can hear her most recent single, “Never Over You,” and other released tracks on Spotify, iTunes or SoundCloud.

 Bonnie Reiss, the global director of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute, died Tuesday at her home in Malibu. She was 62.

Reiss served as Arnold Schwarzenegger’s senior advisor during his term as Governor of California. She also served as California secretary of education and held a seat on the California State Board of Education. 
Schwarzenegger released a statement on Tuesday calling Reiss a treasure to California, the country and everyone she met.
“For the past year, she bravely fought cancer, just as she fought for equality and justice, students and the environment, and every other important issue you can imagine throughout her life of public service,” Schwarzenegger said in the statement. “Bonnie inspired me on a daily basis, and her legacy will inspire me forever.”
According to the statement, a scholarship has been established in Reiss’ name at the USC Price School of Public Policy. 
Jack Knott, the dean of the Price School, remembers Reiss as a spirited individual.
“She’s just been a dynamic leader of the Schwarzenegger institute,” Knott said. “She got the institute off the ground and built it from scratch with Arnold and the faculty and staff here. She made it well-known, not only here at USC but across the country and internationally.”
People loved working with Reiss because of her energy, compassion and infectious enthusiasm, Knott said. Conyers Davis, director of programming and special projects at the Schwarzenegger Institute, said Reiss’ energy made working for her pleasant. 
“Working for Bonnie was first and foremost fun,” Davis said. “She really spent a lot of time and energy making sure that as much as we were getting important things done at the Schwarzenegger Institute, we were having a good time while we did it.”
Davis said Reiss’ compassion is what set her apart from others he’s worked for in the past. Reiss was a mentor to almost everyone she met, Davis recalled. He said she was most comfortable doing work that she knew she would not be recognized for.
“Her name isn’t on a lot of the great legislation that was passed in the last 10 to 15 years here in California but her fingerprints were on so much of it,” Davis said. “She was very comfortable not being the person who got the credit for all the work.”
Reiss also founded the nonprofits Earth Communications Office and After-School All-Stars. She also created the Spotlight Award, which recognizes USC undergraduate students for their civic engagement and volunteerism.
“She really believes in this power of one where a single individual could make a big difference,” Knott said. “Her setting up the Spotlight Award for undergraduate students to honor students who have also been inspirational through their volunteerism reflects that.”
Reiss is survived by her sister Sandi Rabrich, her niece Lori Siegerman, her nephew Jeff Rabrich and her dog Bu Reiss. Rabrich said she will miss her sister’s loving spirit.
“She was giving, loving and she only had the best interest in heart for the environment, for the world [and] for her friends,” Rabrich said. “She was a wonderful sister; her accomplishments were terrific but on a personal level, that’s what meant most to me.”

After winning the 2018 Academy Award for Best Actress, Frances McDormand’s speech aimed to shed light on the film industry’s lack of diversity. She urged all other female nominees to stand up and reminded the audience that every woman standing had stories to tell and projects that needed funding. 
The Women of Cinematic Arts organization hosts the Feminist Media Festival.  Daily Trojan file photo.
Her words resonated with those whose work reminds them every day of the need for fair representation in Hollywood, including USC Women of Cinematic Arts President Tara Shivkumar.
“It’s really nice to finally see that there has been a moment in time where women are actually being taken seriously,” Shivkumar said. “We are using that time to make as much change as we can.”
Founded in 2005 by students, faculty and alumni, the Women of Cinematic Arts aims to combat the gender gap in the film industry by tackling it first at the academic level.
By hosting events on campus such as networking workshops and panels featuring industry experts to provide a platform for female voices, WCA hopes to build a diverse, creative community within the classroom and beyond. WCA invites guests and panelist to provide their diverse perspectives, including but not exclusive to women-specific issues in the film industry. 
“This is a community of women, and all we want to do is lift each other up, and give each other power and respect each other as artists,” WCA Vice President Lauren Foley said. “When you create that space, people will empower one another.”
The organization is open to students of all backgrounds, not just women or cinematic arts majors. For example, Foley is a narrative studies major and a cinematic arts minor. Students of all majors have a chance to build rapports and take advantage of professional opportunities as a part of WCA.
To increase female representation at the student level, WCA hosts an annual Feminist Media Festival, an opportunity for students to submit films to be screened by industry professionals. Last year’s inaugural FMF featured panelists from companies including International Creative Management Partners, Miramax, Legendary and Sundance. 
According to the event’s website, FMF is open to all USC students, regardless of gender or program. All submissions must have at least a 50 percent female production crew, and pass tests that concern the portrayal of women characters. The closing ceremony is scheduled for this Sunday in the Ray Stark Theater from 1 to 3 p.m.
In previous semesters, WCA has invited high profile guests including Haifaa al-Mansour, the first female Saudi filmmaker; Sarah Aubrey, executive vice president of original programming at TNT; and Maria Jacquemetton, executive producer of AMC’s Mad Men.
Shivkumar said the most rewarding part of FMF is the platform it provides participants for future employment. Last year, one student creator was offered an entry-level position in the industry for ICM Partners after a judge viewed her film at the screening. 
 “If I put certain people in a room together at the right moment in time, that kind of magic can happen,” Shivkumar said.
According to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, only one percent of films in 2017 employed 10 or more women in production jobs, in contrast to 70 percent of films employing 10 or more men.
 “I think the issue is really systemic,” Foley said. “People might be tired of the conversation, but there is a reason it’s still happening.”
Both the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements have been monumental in bringing attention to the systemic issues of sexual harassment and workplace inequality. Foley believes this year’s film award shows were somewhat of a catalyst in sparking a defining movement in women’s representation in Hollywood.
“The Golden Globes were a huge moment for me because it feels like there’s change,” Foley said. “Anytime it feels like there’s someone standing up for something that you feel so inherently, that you’ve been taught to deescalate and ignore, is amazing.” 
Names like Harvey Weinstein,  Kevin Spacey and countless others in media, entertainment and the government are now part of a growing list of men in power accused of sexual harassment.
“Raising the awareness and consciousness of men needs to be the priority because that’s the only way we’re going to figure out and fix all of this,” Shivkumar said.
Even as media attention around the #MeToo movement dwindles, the Women of Cinematic Arts will continue to march on and advocate for equality in their industry, hoping to inspire those in other fields of work to rise up and do the same.
“It’s not about putting men down or separating us into categories and identities,” Shivkumar said. “It’s about basic human empathy and understanding that we have to adjust the world to meet everybody’s needs.”

Political correctness, Congressional stalemates and fake news are concepts that have permeated political discourse in the last two years, seemingly changing the landscape of American politics.

On Wednesday, more than 50 students, faculty and community members gathered to discuss these changes in American politics in “The Un-Civil War,” an all-day conference hosted by the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. 
Billed as an opportunity to “advance a bipartisan conversation about civil discourse in modern American politics,” the event consisted of four 90-minute panel discussions featuring three to four experts at a time in fields of politics, sociology, technology and journalism. By bringing together points of view from multiple fields and perspectives on the political spectrum, the event aimed to start a conversation about American civil discourse and offer examples of how to move forward while agreeing to disagree. 
“I hope that today we can shed some light on the un-civil war that too often stains our politics today,” Unruh Institute Director Robert Shrum said in his opening remarks.
He noted that the conference fell on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination, and lauded King’s actions as a remarkable example of the power of civility in the political sphere. 
The four panels tackled the history of political civility, the modern rise of “alternative facts” and the impact of technology and the impact of media on the American political landscape. Though panelists approached these issues from different angles, many agreed that the era of President Donald Trump is unlike any other. 
“We shouldn’t get too overly hysterical about what’s happening today, however, in our lifetime … I don’t think we’ve ever seen anything like we’re seeing today,” said Mickey Kantor, former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and campaign chair of the 1992 Clinton-Gore presidential ticket. “I think it follows eight years of grace and dignity in the White House … and now it’s almost like they threw cold water in your face at about three in the morning, when you’re faced with what we’re seeing in today’s rhetoric.” 
Many panelists touched on the impact of technology and the internet on political discourse. 
“The thing that has struck me the most … in what’s taking place in politics today, has been how detached we have become from fact,” USC professor Margaret Gatz said. She then presented data on the cognitive distortions and filter bubbles that can lead people to believe falsehoods. 
USC professor Peter Mancall said that the modern political discord could be a step toward progress. According to Mancall, there has been a “vast expansion of people in the political discussion” in the past centuries.
“That has led to all sorts of uncomfortable moments, but in some ways … I sort of celebrate the fact that there are more people involved in the discussion than there ever were before,” Mancall said.
At the end of the panel, audience members eagerly questioned the panelists, preparing themselves to take the lessons learned at the conference into the larger world. 
“It’s great that Unruh Institute puts together these events where you can talk about real time issues outside of the classroom with professionals of the field,” said Melanie Franceschini, a senior majoring in political science.
