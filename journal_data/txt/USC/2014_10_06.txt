Due to funding and feedback from over 4,000 users, GreekLink, a social-event app created by USC students for the Greek community, has reached two more college campuses since its debut last semester and added more features.
Updates available · Noah Johnson, above, one of the founders of the GreekLink app, evaluated user responses to improve the app’s design. – Photo coutresy of Noah Johnson
 
Over the summer, the founders of the app, Noah Johnson, a junior majoring in business administration, and his friend Ari Gootnick, an advertising major from the University of Texas, Austin, looked at users’ responses to the app and created an updated design. Then, their developers brought the updates to life.
“The main parts of the update are the messaging feature, where individual fraternity or sorority members can communicate directly or where, say, a president can send out a message to the entire chapter, and the search feature, where you can click on a certain chapter and scroll through the list of members,” Johnson said.
While downloads have doubled since last semester, users still check the app mainly for its initial purpose: to stay informed about Greek social events.
“I use GreekLink to help stay up to date with what’s happening on The Row, not just in my house but in other houses as well,” said Nicole Yarnold, a freshman majoring in global studies. “I think a good amount of students use it. It’s nice to know what’s going on with other chapters as well as your own.”
Besides updating the app’s communication features, Johnson also spent his summer attending a Marshall program called Accelerate, Incubate, Mentor, where his app got access to capital from outside sources. His experience there, in addition to efforts to reach out to family and friends, secured funding for GreekLink.
“Now we can hire a lot of people,” Johnson said. “We have people working for us to expand and market [the app], and we have developers to make changes.”
Johnson said 10 new hires have been made, including two developers who will be starting shortly.
The funding has also opened doors for GreekLink to reach other campuses. Indiana University and Vanderbilt University have introduced the app to their Greek communities, and the app is expected to launch at UCLA and California Polytechnic University San Luis Obispo next month.
To expand across the nation, Johnson and Gootnick contacted friends at other universities, where they hired campus reps. Campus reps publicize GreekLink at their own schools and to reach out to chapters’ social chairs, who have the option to share their house’s social calendar on the app.
Getting GreekLink off the ground was an eight-month process, but maintaining it is also a significant time commitment, Johnson said.
“If I had more time, we could respond to feedback right away and expand faster,” he said. “I’m balancing being a student and growing this company as well, so I’m kind of limited on time.”
Johnson and Gootnick don’t have to do all of the work on their own, though. Johnson has received help from three professors, including Viterbi professor Ashish Soni, who has mentored Johnson on strategy and marketing every week this semester.
“I think we’ve had some great progress,” Soni said. “We’ve had some crucial conversations on the vision behind the business, the size of the opportunity and how to make it a great business.”
Soni was also impressed by the drive Johnson showed to develop his app.
“He made more progress toward the idea than other students — he raised money, he built a product, he’d already set up users,” Soni said. “I thought he was very committed and that it was an interesting idea. The dedication he showed was great.”
Last semester, Johnson said it would be his and Gootnick’s dream to reach every Greek system in the United States. Seven months later, the co-founders are closer to their goal.
“Probably every week we get a school approaching us to introduce the app to their campus, and we’re going to continue to expand,” Johnson said. “It’s exciting. It’s good to know that people are using something I helped create.”

President C.L. Max Nikias announced a national search for USC’s next senior vice president for academic affairs and provost in a letter to USC faculty, staff and students Monday. Current Provost Elizabeth Garrett was named the next president of Cornell University on Sept. 30. In his letter, Nikias emphasized the importance of the appointment for USC’s future.

“I believe this appointment is particularly critical at this juncture in USC’s history, as we are in the midst of taking the university into the ranks of undisputed academically elite universities,” he said in the letter.
In the USC administrative hierarchy, the vice president of academic affairs is the second-ranking administrator to the president. As chief academic officer, his or her responsibilities include gathering reports from each of the university’s deans and provosts. The vice president for academic affairs also oversees several university divisions such as Student Affairs, Libraries and Information Technology Services.
Given the  significant responsibilites of the position, Nikias stressed the importance of finding the right candidate for the position in the letter.
“This person will play a pivotal role in USC’s continued ascent,” he said in the letter.
Nikias’ letter announced the appointment a 13-member faculty advisory committee to carry out the search. The committee members, who were selected by Nikias, include chairs of various USC departments. Among those chosen for the committee were distinguished poet and English Department Chair David St. John and Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry.
USC is also looking outside the university itself for help in the search process. The letter stated that the school is employing Isaacson, Miller, a Boston-based search firm with offices in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, to assist with the hiring process.
Hortensia Amaro, dean’s professor in social work and preventative medicine and one of the members of the committee, echoed Nikias in emphasizing the importance of the search.
“We need another top-class provost,” Amaro said.
Amaro was unable to provide specific details due to the confidentiality of the hiring process.
Ellis Meng, professor of biomedical and electrical engineering, was also selected to serve on the committee. Meng, featured as one of MIT Technology Review’s “Innovators Under 35” in 2009, said she was honored by the appointment.
“It’s such a great honor. The provost is a really important position. It’ll be difficult to find someone who can fill Elizabeth Garrett’s shoes,” Meng said.
Elizabeth Garrett was formally installed as vice president for academic affairs and provost in 2011. Prior to her appointment at USC, she was selected by former President George W. Bush to serve on a bipartisan Tax Reform Panel.
Nikias’ email also asked students for recommendations for candidates to fill the position.
Despite Nikias’ overture, some students said that the search is best left to those most qualified for it.
“I think the ultimate decision should lie with the selection committee, since they know more of what was required, in terms of the skills of a high-level administrator,” said Elaine Krebs, a senior majoring in health and humanity and marine and environmental biology.
The letter invited those with suggestions and potential nominations for the appointment to submit them to uscprovost@imsearch.com.

The Shoah Foundation Center for Advanced Genocide Studies has named Jared McBride, Ph.D, the recipient of the Margee and Douglas Greenberg Research Fellowship.

Douglas Greenberg, the grant’s donor, served as the executive director of the Shoah Foundation for eight years until 2008. He was director during the institute’s move onto the USC campus. His wife Margee, a coordinator at the Office of Disability Services at Rutgers University, was a volunteer at the institute during her husband’s tenure.
Greenberg said that the archives at the Shoah Foundation are so comprehensive and hold such value that emerging scholars in the field of genocide research should use them. Greenberg said that he and his wife had hoped that one day they could make a contribution to the institute.
“We were happy to be in a position where we could do something and contribute to the institute,” Greenberg said. “We knew we wanted it to go towards scholarship and research, a place where we could make a difference.”
A committee of researchers and professors at USC examined and interviewed several candidates for the Greenberg fellowship and selected McBride.
McBride is a recent graduate of the history department at the University of California, Los Angeles. McBride focused his doctoral dissertation on the mass genocide of Nazi-occupied Volhynia, Ukraine. Next January, the fellowship will allow McBride to spend one week at the Shoah Foundation and use their extensive genocide video collection. He will also give a lecture on Jan. 15 on the USC campus about his research.
“Any sort of funding or research to work with the Shoah collection is extremely important — it is a massive collection that should be more utilized,” McBride said.
During his doctoral program, McBride served as an expert consultant on war crimes investigations for the United States Department of Justice. McBride will be a visiting assistant professor for the history department at Columbia University in 2015.
McBride emphasized that the Shoah foundation’s archives are so extensive that young scholars who are working on genocide research can use them in conjunction with the resources that are being utilized in Europe.
“It’s a huge honor to get to be the first person to be awarded this fellowship,” McBride said. “The fellowship gives me extra ability to take some time and integrate the testimony into my work.”
The Greenberg fellowship is the first addition to the Center for Advanced Genocide Research. The Center, which was founded by filmmaker Steven Spielberg in April 2014, focuses on interdisciplinary studies organized to analyze genocide and systematic mass violence on an international scale.
Shoah Foundation Coordinator of External Relations Rob Kuznia explained that the Visual History Archive of the institute, along with the extensive collection of primary sources at Doheny Memorial Library, will provide the research fellow with important sources to further his research.
“The Center uniquely positions USC as being the only world-renowned private research institution with substantial original material from the Holocaust and other genocides,” Kuznia wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan.

This fall has been a big season for Intelligent Dance Music. In the same few weeks that Thom Yorke of Radiohead fame dropped his second solo album Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes and Aphex Twin released Syro, his first album in 13 years — both to critical acclaim — Los Angeles-based electronic musician Steven Ellison, better known under his alias Flying Lotus, dares to venture into the musical limelight with his latest record, You’re Dead!
The dead will walk · After Flying Lotus spread a great deal of material thin over a long setlist a lot of the songs in You’re Dead are too weak to stand alone. This weakness of the album also strengthens it as a concept album by making it worth listening to as a unified experience. – Photo courtesy of Flying Lotus
His venture has indeed been a bold one, with FlyLo taking a multi-pronged approach to promoting his album. In August, Ellison gave fans a preview by releasing the tracklist, song by song, via his Tumblr page. Each song announcement was accompanied by special artwork made by Japanese illustrator Shintaro Kago, who draws in the guro manga style — not for the faint of heart, since the genre combines eroticized elements of gore, guts and the grotesque, which all seem rather fitting given the album’s morbid emphasis on death and the afterlife. To further push the “concept album” vibe of his latest record, Ellison put together “Day of You’re Dead” on Oct. 3, where he teamed up with underground music project Boiler Room to play his album on a 24-hour Internet stream along with a visual piece titled “Psychedelic Death Trip” by filmmaker Xavier Magot. To FlyLo, it’s imperative that listeners digest all components of a work, be they visual or musical, in order to fully appreciate it — hence his emphasis on art and film.
Ellison’s recurring habit of creating long tracklists full of short, choppy songs is highly manifested in You’re Dead! — clocking in at under 40 minutes, this 19-song record seems like it was made for those with short attention spans, or anyone looking to hear a frantic, yet masterful auditory tableau. In it, he brings his usual jazz-influenced electronic style to the table — no surprise, since he’s the nephew of famed jazz musicians Alice and John Coltrane — but this time around, he ramps up the instrumentalism and live-sounding quality to his music, all of which sets him far apart from his electronic contemporaries of the “drop-centric” EDM persuasion.
The opening track, “Theme,” hits listeners with a striking, rapid-fire medley of progressive jazz, co-opted by FlyLo and sprinkled with his signature smatterings of electronic bass. The following few songs continue this instrumental jazz theme, including drum-heavy “Tesla” and “Fkn Dead,” a 40-second slow jam that showcases funky electric guitar licks.
The main single off the album, “Never Catch Me,” features vocals by rapper Kendrick Lamar, who waxes poetic on life and death with lyrics like “This that life beyond your own life / This ain’t physical for mankind / This that out-of-body experience / no coincidence you been died.” Lamar’s lyricism quite literally sets the thanatophilic tone for the entire album, just in case the listener doesn’t catch FlyLo’s drift this far into the album.
Flying Lotus is known for recruiting well-known guests on his albums,   being no exception. Frequent collaborators that reappear on this LP include Thundercat and Laura Darlington; renowned multi-instrumentalist Herbie Hancock even plays keyboard on a few songs. Most notably, in the track “Dead Man’s Tetris,” Ellison takes on his rapping alter ego, Captain Murphy, to spit verses alongside Snoop Dogg. The two suddenly find themselves dead in a liminal afterlife where they run into other deceased characters, rapping, “Hold up, me and Dilla ‘bout to blow some trees / Hold up, pass the Austin and the Freddie Mercury,” all over an arcade game-inspired chiptune soundscape. In “The Boys Who Died In Their Sleep,” Ellison once again assumes the role of Captain Murphy and concocts an ode to prescription drugs, slurring, “anything to take the edge away / I look inside my mind and dream about the world within my eyelids,” before jetting off into a frenetic mental pill-fueled journey.
Despite the bizarre name, “Turkey Dog Coma” is one of the standout tracks on this album; it’s a fast-paced, drum- and bass-driven song with constantly changing time signatures, almost echoing one of FlyLo’s single releases titled “About that time//A glitch is a glitch,” specially made for the soundtrack to the popular cartoon program Adventure Time. Just in giving it a quick listen, one can instantly notice how far Ellison has come in the span of just over a year while still retaining that same driving energy. He crafts an air of suave, clear-headed coolness through his layering of live instruments, synths, hums and vocalizations and it characterizes his entire repertoire.
“Siren Song” featuring Angel Deradoorian, formerly of the Dirty Projectors, is just that — a seductive and enchanting melody where Deradoorian’s celestial vocalizations weave back and forth through a slow-burning, ambient gliding and distorted guitar melody. This ethereal tone is paralleled in other tracks like “Obligatory Cadence,” which introduces lofty strings, and “Coronus, The Terminator,” a neo-soul ballad with gospel-style crooning. It’s curious how Ellison creates heavenly, angelic imagery within these songs to tie in with the overarching theme of death.
Since the duration of the actual music is spread so thin across a vast tracklist, a lot of the songs are too weak to serve as standalone tracks, which is the biggest gripe fans might have with this album at first listen. This need not be a negative thing, however; actually, it makes the reason behind the effort to present You’re Dead! as a concept album all the more apparent. FlyLo even tweeted his fans, requesting, “The first time you listen to You’re Dead! try to clear [30-plus minutes] of your super busy and important schedule and listen to the whole ride.”
If Flying Lotus fans were awaiting another Cosmogramma — one of his earlier, landmark records — You’re Dead! might prove disheartening in that it indicates an exponential departure from his early sound, which may have been hinted at in his two-year-old LP Until the Quiet Comes. For those wanting an instantly danceable, ready-for-the-club track, this album might be hard to stomach, but the rewards of FlyLo’s ambition can be reaped with patience and an open mind.
Closing on the chant, “We will live on forever and ever,” You’re Dead! may have just ironically immortalized itself within the electronic music world. Though the long tracklist might seem long and intimidating, it’s a quick listen and ends earlier than it seems it should, much like life. FlyLo is just here to guide us through, and to reassure us that there’s nothing to fear in death and the unknown.

Despite its sophisticated French name, a tartine is simply a thick slice of rustic bread lightly toasted and adorned with whatever sweet and savory ingredients suit your fancy. Served with a lightly dressed green salad, a tartine feels more special than the predictable PB&J but just as quick and easy to prepare.
Fresh and easy · These delicious sandwiches are a treat that require only a little amount of preparation time for a lot of flavor and satisfaction. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
Since the open-faced toasts should be enjoyed with a fork and knife, they accommodate toppings that would otherwise slide out of a sandwich, such as toasted nuts and seeds. Because of the dish’s simplicity, it is important to use a quality loaf of rustic bread. While artisanal varieties will cost you a few dollars more than their mass-produced counterparts, they make up for the expense in superior flavor and texture.
I have shared a few suggestions to get you inspired, but the best way to develop creative recipes is to use seasonal ingredients. Dedicate a few minutes out of your Wednesday to peruse the Trojan Farmers Market, admiring the vibrant displays of fresh produce and sampling liberally. Pick up whichever vegetables look best and roast them using my step-by-step guide.
Roasting Vegetables Right
Roasted vegetables are incredibly versatile and convenient to have on-hand. All you need is a splash of olive oil, a generous sprinkle of sea salt and pepper, and a few sprigs of fresh herbs to achieve wonderful flavor and texture. While the method is quite simple, even experienced cooks fall privy to common mistakes. Follow the instructions below to achieve perfectly crisp yet tender vegetables every time.
1) Cut vegetables into equal sizes. Vegetables that are uniform in size will cook evenly. With petite vegetables such as baby carrots and button mushrooms, feel free to roast them whole.
2) Don’t overcrowd the pan. Giving your vegetables room to breath allows them to crisp up evenly.
3) Go easy on the oil. You want just enough olive oil to create a glossy, even coating. Too much and you will end up with a greasy final product.
4) Season well. For optimum flavor, be generous with salt and pepper.
5) Turn up the heat. One of the most common mistakes people make is to roast vegetables on low heat for a long time. Cranking up your oven is the difference between caramelized, golden brown edges and a mushy mess.
Cinnamon-Roasted Butternut Squash
Test your newfound roasting skills using this delicately spiced butternut squash recipe. The caramelized, slightly sweet morsels are heavenly on their own, but even better when incorporated into a tartine with creamy ricotta cheese and toasted pepitas.
• 1 1/2 pounds butternut squash, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• 3 sage leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried herb of choice
• 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
• 1/4 teaspoon salt
• 1/4 teaspoon pepper
 
Active: 5 min; Total: 30 min. Serves four.
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Toss squash with olive oil, sage, cinnamon, salt and pepper in a wide rimmed baking sheet, making sure that all the cubes are evenly coated. Roast for 25-30 minutes, stirring once halfway through the cooking time, until the squash are browned and tender.
Roasted vegetables can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three to four days.
Tartine with White Bean Smash and Tomatoes
• One 15-ounce can white beans, drained
• 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
• 2 basil leaves, sliced in ribbons
• 1 tablespoon lemon juice
• 1 tablespoon olive oil
• Pinch of red pepper flakes
• 1/4 teaspoon salt
• 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
• 4 large 1/2-inch-thick slices rustic bread, toasted
• 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, sliced lengthwise
• Sea salt, for sprinkling
 
Total: 10 min. Serves two.
1. Place white beans, feta and basil in a medium bowl and smash them with a fork until a chunky paste forms. Mix in lemon juice, oil, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Taste and season with more salt if necessary.
2. To assemble tartine, spread about two tablespoons of white bean smash on each slice of bread. Top with a few cherry tomato halves and sprinkle with sea salt. Serve.
Tartine with Goat Cheese and Sautéed Mushrooms and Kale 

• 1 tablespoon olive oil
• 1 tablespoon minced shallots (from half of a medium shallot)
• 2 cups (8 ounces) stemmed and thinly sliced button mushrooms
• 1 1/2 cups thinly sliced kale
• 1/2 teaspoon thyme leaves
• 2 tablespoons milk
• Salt and pepper, to taste
• 4 large 1/2-inch-thick slices rustic bread, toasted
• 4 tablespoons goat cheese, divided
 
Total: 15 min. Serves two.
1. Warm olive oil in a medium sauté pan set over medium heat. Add shallots and sauté until fragrant and translucent, about one minute. Add mushrooms and thyme, season with generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook, stirring just once or twice, until dark brown and tender, about four to five minutes. Mix in kale and cook until soft and wilted, about two minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, add milk and simmer until the mushrooms and kale have absorbed most of the milk.
2. To assemble tartine, spread one tablespoon of goat cheese on each  slice of bread. Top with about 1/4 cup mushrooms and kale. Serve.

Bacaro LA, USC’s favorite Hoover Street restaurant, recently opened a new counterpart near Santa Monica. Bacari Playa Del Rey, the third restaurant opened by the Kronfli brothers and chef Lior Hillel, is a quaint restaurant situated on a hill a block away from the ocean in Playa Del Rey. The small but satisfying menu features a variety of cicchetti — small, tapas-like Venetian plates — and is accompanied by a large selection of cocktails, beer and wine.
Home cooked taste · The quality of the food makes up for the small and uncomfortable layout by emphasizing variety with paninis and salads. – Uracha Chaiyapinunt | Daily Trojan
The entrance to the restaurant is a small, enclosed patio-type room with soft lighting and open windows that let in the ocean breeze. Customers can then proceed to the larger, precariously organized dining and bar area. Here, patrons waiting — often up to an hour — to be seated can get a drink and stand around the bar. The room is awkwardly sectioned and loud, however, causing a chaotic atmosphere. The dining portion is split into two parts, one directly in front of the bar and the other around the corner. The second part finally provides a tiny bit of reprieve from the noise of the rest of the restaurant.
Despite Bacari’s too-small and somewhat uncomfortable setup, its décor provides a homey aspect that softens the overall ambiance. Empty wine bottles and fairy lights alongside soft wood and giant chalkboards give off an earthy, surprisingly comfortable vibe. Boards display the wine and cocktail menus, written in chalk and color-coded by category. Bacari’s mellow wooden walls, high ceilings and floors give the small restaurant a rustic feel.
The staff is constantly bustling but friendly and helpful. They make it clear from the moment they seat customers that they work as a team, and they seem to have that relationship down pat. The staff runs like a well-oiled machine, helping customers at various tables and delivering food constantly.
The food makes up for any lack of space or long wait time. Every dish comes out of the kitchen looking and smelling divine and the taste does not disappoint.
The caprese — a perfect combination of savory yellow and green tomatoes alongside fresh mozzarella and a delectable pesto — is arguably the best in Los Angeles. The tomatoes are fresh and flavorful, not the least bit sour and perfectly complement the equally fresh mozzarella. The tasty pesto, however, is the highlight of the dish. A perfect blend of nut and herb flavors, it is mouthwateringly delicious.
The bruschette is offered in surprisingly bold flavors, such as fire-roasted pepper and Tuscan white bean, and is bursting with well-balanced flavors. The bread is perfectly toasted and provides a delicious bed for the various savory toppings.
The chicken panini highlights yet another rich condiment that Bacari has done just right — this time, the garlic aioli. Bacari’s delicious bread houses warm slices of chicken breast, juicy tomatoes and plenty more fresh mozzarella. This sandwich, also perfectly toasted, is complemented superbly by a full-bodied garlic aioli.
The salads, though far from typical, also feature fresh and delicious ingredients in combinations that, though off the beaten path, are surprisingly good. The grilled romaine salad, for example, topped with beets, pecans and a creamy balsamic and parmesan vinaigrette, provides an intriguing and appetizing amalgam.
The pizzas make use of unconventional combinations — the bacon and brie, for example, boasts a spicy side. Their inimitably cooked crust and perfect sauce-to-topping ratio make them very appetizing.
Bacari’s chefs are clearly top-notch, and one would expect food of this quality, especially in Playa Del Rey, to be very pricey. The prices, though, are more than reasonable — nearly every plate offered is $8; and customers can choose to order in sets of three for $21. A full meal of nine plates for three people was just $63 and worth every penny.
The delicious and well-priced food is an obvious draw to the tiny restaurant on the hill in Playa Del Rey — its imminent success already apparent from the long wait. Any downsides to the restaurant are quickly overshadowed by the first bite of its exquisite and reasonably priced dishes — Bacari is well worth the wait.
 
Bacari is located at 6805 Vista Del Mar Lane in Playa Del Rey. Open Sunday through Wednesday from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. and Thursday through Saturday from 5 p.m. to midnight.

Even the Fastest Man Alive can’t outrun a trio of lazy screenwriters.
Breezy, superficially charming and disconcertingly derivative, the first episode of the new CW series, The Flash, takes the Scarlet Speedster’s classic Silver Age origin and dilutes it into something safe and familiar, a squeaky-clean YA drama engineered to serve as a sunnier supplement to the network’s darker, wildly popular Arrow while continuing the small-screen expansion of the DC universe. Despite its slick production values and an earnest, fresh-faced cast, the result is an entity whose very existence feels driven by brand extension rather than creative necessity. The same can be said for plenty of shows, especially those involving superheroes, but they’re not supposed to make it this obvious.
The pilot opens with the obligatory tragic backstory. 11-year-old Barry Allen (Logan Williams) is a budding science whiz who’s constantly on the run from a pack of schoolyard bullies. He complains about his slowness to his loving mother Norma (Michelle Harrison), who survives just long enough to dispense some Uncle Ben-approved wisdom — “It’s better to have a good heart than fast legs.” — before being ripped apart by a monstrous red and yellow vortex that materializes one night in the Allen family’s living room.
Despite Barry’s eyewitness account, Henry Allen (John Wesley Shipp, who played the Flash in the original 1990 series) is accused of his wife’s murder and sentenced to life in prison, prompting Barry to devote himself to forensic science in order to clear his father’s name. Sensing the boy’s potential, Detective Joe West (Jesse L. Martin) adopts Barry and raises him alongside his lovely daughter Iris (Candice Patton), which leads to the show’s only attempt at offbeat weirdness: a deeply awkward romance between adopted brother and sister.
Flash forward -— sorry, couldn’t resist — a few years and Barry, now played by the genially bland Grant Gustin, is a brilliant, socially graceless crime scene investigator in the Central City police force. After a lightning-assisted explosion at S.T.A.R. Labs leaves Barry in a five-week coma, he awakens to find he has developed super-speed and a host of other “metahuman” powers.
Inspired by the example of Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell), who protects the neighboring Starling City as a costumed vigilante known as the Green Arrow, the young man squeezes into a maroon speed-suit — because apparently bright red is too gauche for modern superheroes — and becomes the Flash, pledging to use his newfound abilities to help the innocent and thwart the dark and stormy ambitions of Clyde Mardon (Chad Root), a.k.a. the Weather Wizard, a sociopathic bank robber who can manipulate the weather thanks to the same explosion that transformed Barry.
The episode, directed by David Nutter, who previously helmed episodes of Game of Thrones and Homeland, and written by Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg and DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns, is a bloodless cycle of genre tropes whose cardinal sin lies in attempting to recast its hero as an off-brand blend of Clark Kent (the goofy do-gooder) and Peter Parker (the empowered nerd). The Barry Allen character, created by Robert Kanigher, John Broome and the legendary Carmine Infantino, has been a fan-favorite in the DC universe ever since his first appearance in the pages of Showcase #4 in 1956. He wasn’t the first hero to use the Flash moniker — that was Jay Garrick, a Golden Age character who drifts in and out of DC’s official continuity more often than Bat-Mite -— but he is consistently remembered as the most beloved incarnation of the character.
Allen was originally envisioned as a wisecracking charmer whose adventures doubled as an educational springboard to get kids interested in physics and chemistry — each issue typically revolved around the practical application of some scientific principle — while defying the popular stereotype of the scientist as an ineffectual weakling. Grant Morrison admired the character so much he moved metaphysical mountains to bring him back from the dead in the pages of the Scottish writer’s crossover opus Final Crisis.
Gustin’s portrayal of Barry, by contrast, has much more in common with Tobey Maguire’s performance as Peter Parker in Sam Raimi’s original Spider-Man trilogy than with any previous version of the Flash. Like Maguire’s Peter, Barry is a discomfited, guilt-ridden outsider who only feels truly free when he’s wearing his costume. There’s even a scene where he discovers his newly enhanced physique — “Lightning gave me abs?” — that’s lifted directly from the first Raimi movie. All this indiscriminate sampling makes The Flash feel like a ham-fisted remix of every origin story we’ve seen in the last 14 years — and heaven knows we’ve seen enough of those.
The supporting cast does what they can to nourish the alarmingly thin material. Martin radiates noble exhaustion as Detective West, and the father-son scenes between Shipp and Gustin are steeped in believable regret. Root barely registers as the Weather Wizard, however, and Tom Cavanaugh feels utterly miscast as Harrison Wells, the enigmatic, wheelchair-bound head of S.T.A.R. Labs, an organization that plays a vital role in the DC universe. This was a part that called for the grit and gravitas of Brian Cox or Albert Finney, not the actor best known for playing Zach Braff’s brother on Scrubs. Important future players such as Rick Cosnett’s Eddie Thawne and Danielle Panabaker’s Dr. Caitlin Snow pop up and disappear so quickly they scarcely have time to make an impression, while Carlos Valdes’ engineering wunderkind Cisco Ramon is reduced to cheap comic relief.
So is the Crimson Comet already running on empty? Not necessarily. This is just a pilot episode and doesn’t necessarily reflect the direction the show itself will take. If they juice up the writing and avoid leaning on too many “Freak of the Week” supervillain introductions, the series could potentially bounce back. Remember, it took Arrow nearly a full season to figure out it wasn’t a small-screen version of Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy. Based on what we’ve seen so far, though, The Flash is off to a sluggish start.
 
Solid review. Hopefully it doesn’t take long for the writing to improve or for Barry to gain confidence out of costume.

After defeating Arizona 3-0 on the road in their Pac-12 Conference opener on Sept. 26, the USC women’s soccer team returned home this weekend looking to keep the ball rolling against Colorado and Utah.
Setting the table · Junior midfielder Reilly Parker set up one of the Women of Troy’s two goals against Utah with a beautiful corner kick. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
 
On paper, the Women of Troy (8-2-2, 2-1-0 Pac-12) dominated the first game, outshooting Colorado (8-4-0, 2-1-0) by wide a wide margin, including a 14-0 advantage in corner kicks. Yet when the final horn sounded Friday, the final score stood in stark contrast to the statistics: Colorado 1, USC 0.
Two days later, however, the Women of Troy outlasted the Utes (7-2-3, 0-2-1) by a score 2-0.
The lone goal of the Friday’s game came off a surprising counterattack in the fifth minute initiated by a goal kick from Colorado’s Kate Scheele directly to forward Madison Krauser, who beat the defense and angled a shot perfectly past leaping USC senior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley. The early goal proved to be the difference, as the Women of Troy were unable to equalize during the next 85 minutes, despite four shots on goal and multiple attempts that just barely missed the crossbar.
As the first conference loss of the season for the Women of Troy, the defeat was disappointing, especially considering that the chances to win were certainly there.
“Friday was a bummer, not only because we lost and conceded a goal, but also because we gave up the goal early,” Stanley said. “After that game, we wanted to wash out the game and refocus our mentality.”
Though the loss stung, USC head coach Keidane McAlpine wasn’t overly concerned with the outcome.
“All in all I actually thought we played pretty well,” McAlpine said. “We were just a half step off and didn’t quite find that extra gear when we needed it. Give credit to Colorado, they learned their lesson from their first conference loss and gritted their way through this game.”
With another matchup looming, there wasn’t much time to dwell on the loss. Clad in pink headbands and wristbands to raise breast cancer awareness, the Women of Troy put together 90 minutes of solid soccer and got past Utah on Sunday.
“We came out today and had an awesome game, especially defensively,” Stanley said. “We switched some things up and we played really solid. Today was a good win and a good shutout for the defense. Our forwards finished their chances as well. Overall, we took care of business … you can’t ask for much more than that.”
McAlpine was also pleased with his team’s performance.
“There was a definite difference between Friday’s game and [Sunday]’s game,” the first-year coach said. “In both games we were aggressive early, which I like to see, but today we were able to stick them in neck. We played with a ton of energy today and that is something this team is built to do. Utah wanted to play slow today but we wanted to speed the game up, and ultimately, we were able to do that.”
The defense was stout the entire game, as evidenced by the shutout, but even more comforting for USC fans were the team’s two goals. Senior midfielder Alex Quincey, who now has a team-leading nine on the season, scored both. She was close to putting a third away in the second half on a one-on-one with Utah goalkeeper Lindsey Luke, but her shot sailed just wide to the right.
“Obviously you need someone on the team to score in order to win, and today it just happened to be me,” Quincey said. “We were kinda bummed from losing against Colorado on Friday so it was great to come out today and get a win.”
Junior midfielder Reilly Parker, who soundly struck a first-half corner kick into the box that found Quincey’s head for the score, set one of Quincey’s goals up beautifully.
“Reilly [Parker] was great, she kicked the corner kick right to me, almost like she was serving it to me on a silver platter,” Quincey said. “All I had to do was just get a head on it, and luckily I did and finished the goal.”
McAlpine was also pleased to see the offense find its way once again, especially after the team made a point to spend time working on some offensive situations in between the two games.
“We didn’t capitalize Friday, so we spent a little time Saturday making sure we were in the right places and being a little more hungry in terms of our scoring attitude,” he said. “And even though there was a lot of offensive pressure, there are still a few places in which we need to improve.”
Even with improvements yet to be made, the team is confident that they are headed in the right direction. The win Sunday helps to numb the sting of defeat inflicted after the Colorado game and has the Women of Troy back on the right foot heading into a critical week of their season.
This Friday, they will square off against No. 12 Cal, followed by a matchup against No. 3-ranked Stanford on Sunday. Both games will be played at McAlister Field, and each will provide the Women of Troy with a huge opportunity to prove themselves against top-end competition. The team will look to build off of their bounce-back performance Sunday in order to prepare.
“Everybody is doing great right now, and the defense is making my life easy,” Stanley said. “The offense needed to focus on putting away some chances after Friday, and they did that. Both collectively and individually we focused on starting fast and applying pressure, because we knew that would be a key to winning the game. All 11 players did that today, and as you can see, we got it done.”

I don’t remember what happened to the Trojans this weekend, and no, it’s not for the reason most folks would expect of a college student on game day. It’s because in the rush of having to step on the field to interview players, tweeting out the final result of USC’s game against ASU (which I presumed would end 34-32), I was shocked to hear big cheers from the ASU supporting contingent of the crowd. Everything was a blur. Members of the press rushing to the visiting players. USC players walking off the field looking equal parts shocked and enraged. The student section sitting in stunned silence, while f-bombs were hurled in the hallway to the home locker room.
Let’s be honest — nobody needs to relive the moment ASU wide receiver Jaelen Strong snatched a wobbly Hail Mary pass from Mike Bercovici out of the sky — with the exception of the defensive coaching staff, who should have the GIF of that play on loop permanently set as their desktop background.
On the field, it looked as if Strong and the Good Lord Himself were the only ones who knew where that ball was going. USC sophomore defensive back Leon McQuay III was three yards deep into the end zone (where there were no receivers) — and he was the one of the closest USC players to the ball.
Senior linebacker Hayes Pullard, who was closest to the play, has been called upon to be many things for the Trojans over the years. Unfortunately, none of those things entailed morphing into Richard Sherman in Hail Mary situations. The three defenders backpedaling in intermediate coverage certainly didn’t know that Bercovici was going to go long. All of this adds up to the fact that I can’t blame the USC defensive players for that play, because it was probably the single worst play call I’ve seen all year.
That failed Hail Mary defense was actually more endemic of USC’s defense this season. The Trojans’ defense tries to do a lot of things. Sometimes it succeeds, but in the Trojans’ two losses, it failed. Badly.
Defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox favors a 3-4 defense with a “bend, but don’t break” approach. It relies on the collapsing size of the field of play and the out-of-bounds markers to assist in the coverage game — it’s actually quite brilliant when it works. By the time an opposing offense marches into the red zone, Wilcox can drop linebackers into coverage and swarm the shortened field, giving the pass rush time to secure a sack or force a poor decision from opposing quarterbacks.
There’s a problem with this approach, though, and it’s the fact that when the system “breaks,” it’s incredibly costly — the Trojan defense that had given up zero passing touchdowns the entire season prior to Saturday gave Mike Bercovici five touchdowns and a story for his grandkids — not to mention an average of 18.9 yards per completed pass. Here’s a list of the length of ASU’s touchdown “drives”: 2:33, 2:24, 12 seconds, 14 seconds and 23 seconds.
It’s too early to call for USC head coach Steve Sarkisian’s job at this point, but the game was lost on some poor defensive play calling. The Trojan defense saw some major changes over the offseason — few of them were good changes. Let’s not forget that Dion Bailey and Demetrius Wright left for the NFL Draft, that this season’s newly christened Lord Voldemort is still indefinitely suspended with two high ankle sprains, and most importantly, Clancy Pendergast is looking for work.
This is not a test — the defensive coordinator of the Trojans’ hellacious, physical defense from last season is currently unemployed by a college football team. Meanwhile, Wilcox is given the nod when it was Pendergast’s breakneck coverage schemes under last season’s 5-2 defense that made the best use of junior defensive end Leonard Williams’ blocker-swallowing abilities.
Instead, the Trojans continue to bend, not break, under the befuddling schemes of Wilcox. Sophomore Su’a Cravens plays linebacker against a non-existent rushing attack and is nowhere to be found in what should have been a prevent scheme in the last seconds.
My colleague Jake Davidson wrote that the Trojans have yet to fashion an identity for themselves this season. He’s right. The notion of a Trojan defense being flimsy enough to even bend is so foreign to us that it does not merit comprehension. We’ve seen broken defenses (The People of USC v. Monte Kiffin, 2012), and we’ve seen the famous defenses of the Cushing, Matthews, Maualuga years. But we’ve never seen a defense as puzzling as this, incurring penalty after penalty and getting blown past on coverage despite two five-star recruit defensive backs in Cravens and McQuay.
The Trojans have a long way to go, both coaching and discipline-wise, before they can hope to beat the likes of head coach Rich Rodriguez and the Wildcats. This is not a matter of team morale, but a matter of one coaching staff simply outclassing the other — and I’m afraid Sarkisian and Wilcox may be in over their heads against Rich Rod in Tucson.

The Trojans (3-2, 2-1 Pac-12) have made a habit of falling to the Sun Devils (4-1, 2-1); last season, a devastating 62-41 defeat led to the firing of former head coach Lane Kiffin.
For the second time this season, USC will have to regroup after a tough-to-swallow loss, and they will have to do so quickly as they head back to the feared state of Arizona to take on No. 10 Arizona (5-0, 2-0).
The Wildcats made a historic leap in the polls this week after upsetting then No. 2 Oregon last Thursday, becoming the first team to make the jump from being unranked to the Top 10 since 1989.
Even though the Wildcats have a better record and ranking than the Trojans on paper, USC is still a three-point favorite to win on the road.
Though the Trojans will get back to work on Howard Jones Field on Tuesday, head coach Steve Sarkisian addressed some of the things that went wrong against the Sun Devils and after watching the game film, he continued to express his dismay.
“Quite honestly, it doesn’t get any better,” Sarkisian said. “We missed a lot of opportunities. It’s easy to see the drops. Cody [Kessler] would like to have [some passes] back.”
Hail Mary Answered
In the days following the game, many questions surrounded the last play formation and play call by the coaching staff with seven seconds remaining, which eventually resulted in the 46-yard, game-winning Hail Mary.
Sarkisian revealed that the coaching staff had called one defense initially, but switched the play call during a delay. Despite the confusion when changing formations, the coaching staff confirmed that USC players still adjusted into their correct positions.
Sarkisian also said that sophomore safety Leon McQuay III was tasked as the “jumper” to bat down the ball on the Hail Mary, but ended up running into senior linebacker Hayes Pullard and no play on the ball was made.
As much as the Trojan faithful wants to blame the loss on the last play of the game, the 73-yard catch and run touchdown by ASU’s Cameron Smith that made it 34-32 USC with 2:43 remaining cannot be forgotten.
This big play immediately followed a 53-yard rushing touchdown by redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen that sent a majority of USC fans, who believed the game was no longer in doubt, to the exits.
“The biggest thing we need to learn from this is that the game is never over until there are zeros on the clock,” Sarkisian said.
Punting Kessler 
A lot of criticism was also geared towards Sarkisian in regard to his special teams strategy.
Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, who is not designated on the team’s punting depth chart, “pooch punted” the majority (four of six times) of the team’s fourth-down calls.
It remains unknown whether or not Kessler had practiced punting in practice, but he did punt in high school.
“He did a good job,” Sarkisian said.
The reason for Kessler’s increased role at punter was at least partially due to the absence of starting sophomore long snapper Zach Smith, who suffered a concussion against Oregon State and was not cleared to play in time for the game.
Sarkisian and the Trojans will try to learn from their mistakes as they gear up to take on an Arizona team with a lot of momentum in a crucial Pac-12 tilt.
USC’s showdown against the Wildcats will kick off at 7:30 p.m. and be nationally televised on ESPN 2.
More bad decision-making by Sark and WIlcox to mess up another potential win.  Until Sark hands over the OC duties to Helton, SC will continue to lose important games, and especially those where we are supposed to win. USC was favorited to beat ASU and screwed the pooch. USC is favorited to beat Zona, and Sark will once again, screw the pooch.
The only game SC has a reasonable chance to win is the Colorado game, this year. I hope I’m wrong, but I don’t think so.

Last Friday night on his HBO program, Real Time, Bill Maher bickered with Ben Affleck in a heated argument about the nature of Islam. Once the two — along with Sam Harris, the author of Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion — succeeded in turning the debate into a yelling match, the whole discussion shifted from liberalism and its reticence on issues in the Muslim world to a cyclical argument over whether or not Islam is inherently “the only religion that acts like the mafia,” as Maher said.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
Affleck’s defense of Islam against Maher’s seemingly bigoted characterizations of the religion was certainly well-intentioned, but he made it a matter of the West versus Islam rather than a fight against fundamentalism that both people of Muslim heritage and Westerners face. The interview opened with this statement from Maher:
“Liberals need to stand up for liberal principles … freedom of speech, freedom to practice any religion you want without fear of violence, freedom to leave a religion, equality for women, equality for minorities,” Maher said. “But then when you say in the Muslim world, ‘This is what’s lacking,’ then they get upset.” Following that, Harris added, “The crucial point of confusion is that we have been sold this meme of Islamophobia where every criticism of the doctrine of Islam gets conflated with bigotry toward Muslims as people. That is intellectually ridiculous.”
“Islamophobia” seems to be the term that triggered Affleck’s outburst, suggesting that his main agenda had been to counter Maher’s critique on liberalism more than his attack on jihadism. It’s true that Maher shouldn’t have overgeneralized and said that Islam is a “mafia” that kills, but looking past the generalizations made, there’s some truth to Maher’s points.
To play the defender of the religion is one thing, but in doing so, Affleck seems to have trivialized the gravity of the state of fundamentalism. Liberals face a battle against the ideology of fundamentalism — it’s not about stereotypical generalizations or, as Affleck’s response suggested, minimizing responses to that ideology.
Within modern liberalism, there’s a strong reluctance to criticize other cultures. Liberals, a group whose mission is to stand up for free speech and gender equality, aren’t as vocal when it comes to the issues of the Muslim world — and they need to be for the sake of the many innocent people slaughtered by that minority of fundamentalists. Critiquing Muslim fundamental ideas against jihadism is key, and it needs to be done in a way that distinguishes Islam from Islamism. Affleck’s defense, though made in good faith, downplayed the scope of the challenge that people of Muslim heritage themselves face today. Many Westerners in the liberal camp haven’t been outspoken enough in critiquing that extremist wing of Islam, and as exhibited by Affleck’s comments, fail to see the urgency to defeat that radical part of the religion.
The dissent that Maher stirred up, whether people agree with his points or not, is healthy for a community that needs to continually challenge and test its principles in different contexts. He summed it up well when he told Salon, “There’s a knee-jerk reaction sometimes among liberals — ‘Oh, we need to be protective of a group that certainly does face prejudice and bigotry in America’ (and I’m certainly against that) — but we need to understand that it’s a wider issue.”

As liberals we should always be in support of universal justice, applied equally. As an atheist myself, I’d hate to weigh in the argument over what someone’s particular ‘sacred text’ espouses as it would like arguing over how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. In the history of Christianity, both sides used bible verses to support their positions on slavery.
While Maher and Harris made defensible points on acts that are rightly condemned, Affleck was right in asserting that such a broad brush defames the peaceful practitioners of a given faith.
Maher used poll numbers to supposedly establish that because a percentage of adherents felt a certain way, that it therefore condemned the entire faith. In all of these cases, regardless of the religious tradition, it is the proxies claiming to be acting in the name of their God(s)/faith that is the problem.
When people of the old world used the appeal to Manifest Destiny to justify their theft of the land of the indigenous people in the Americas, would you try to arbitrate the issue based on whose god-view had more veracity?
Ann Coulter has spoken on this campus before. She is on record as saying with regard to our own foreign adventures, “We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.”
Would anyone care to suggest that Coulter speaks for Christianity?
William,
You prove that a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing and your insinuation that Christianity and Islam are similar proves this.
Christ turned the other cheek, embraced his neighbors, taught loving-kindness, etc…
Mohammed did the opposite (not that matters to you in your thinking about these men and the religions they spawned).  Mohammed killed, raped, had intercourse with a nine year old girl, stole and pillaged, tortured and enslaved.
===
Christians have committed untold horrors in the name of Christ and doing so committed sins.  Christ practiced and preached compassion and love for others.
When Muslims commit violent Jihad in the name of Allah they are promised great gifts.

Your relativistic mumbo-jumbo says more about your superficiality than it says about what it is you are pretending to have knowledge about.
Calling a hateful religion hateful is not hate speech. It’s a statement of fact.
 Read the Quran, hadiths and Sunna if you want to know what a hateful religion is.
A beheading in Woolwich, a suicide bomb in Beijing, a blown-up marathon in
Boston, a shooting in the head of a young Pakistani girl seeking education, a
destroyed shopping mall in Nairobi – and so it continues, in the name of Islam,
from south London to Timbuktu. It is time to take stock, especially on the
left, since these things are part of the world’s daily round.
Leave aside the parrot-cry of “Islamophobia” for a moment. I will return to
it. Leave aside, too, the pretences that it is all beyond comprehension.
“Progressives” might ask instead: what do Kabul, Karachi, Kashmir, Kunming and
a Kansas airport have in common? Is it that they all begin with “K”? Yes. But
all of them have been sites of recent Islamist or, in the case of Kansas, of
wannabe-Islamist, attacks; at Wichita Airport planned by a Muslim convert ready
to blow himself up, and others, “in support of al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula”. “We cannot stop lone wolves,” a British counterterrorism expert
told us after Woolwich. Are they “lone”? Of course not.
A gas facility in southern Algeria, a hospital in Yemen, an Egyptian police convoy
in the Sinai – it’s complex all right – a New Year’s party in the southern
Philippines, a railway station in the Caucasus, a bus terminal in Nigeria’s
capital, and on and on, have all been hit by jihadis, with hostages taken,
suicide belts detonated, cars and trucks exploded, and bodies blown to bits.
And Flight MH370? Perhaps. In other places – in Red Square and Times Square, in
Jakarta and New Delhi, in Amman and who-knows-where in Britain – attacks have
been thwarted. But in 2013 some 18 countries got it in the neck (so to
speak) from Islam’s holy warriors….

Islam has been the subject of recent debate, and even Hollywood heavyweights have started to partake in the discussion. Last Friday, Gone Girl star Ben Affleck appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher alongside author Sam Harris, The New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof and politician and MSNBC political analyst Michael Steele, during which Affleck blasted Maher for his “gross” and “racist” characterizations of Islam.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan 
The debate was sparked when Maher began discussing the need for liberals to start defending liberal principles such as freedom of speech and equality for women and minorities, qualities he deemed directly contrary to Islam. Maher went on to characterize Islam as “the only religion that acts like the mafia — that will f–king kill you if you say the wrong thing, draw the wrong picture or write the wrong book.” In response, Affleck pointed out Maher’s ignorance toward the religion as a whole in minimizing an entire religious belief to “the mother lode of bad ideas.”
Though Affleck’s defense of Islam against Maher’s offensive tirade was laudable, it prompts an important question: Where, in this conversation on the codified doctrine of Islam, were the Muslims?
It’s hard to imagine that those coordinating Maher’s show couldn’t manage to find a single Muslim or Islamic scholar willing to speak at length on the complex theological issues discussed on the program. There are plenty of esteemed Islamic scholars who easily could have joined the conversation. But rather than prepare for the event in which Islam would be discussed on the program,  the program chose instead to forego bringing in any sort of religious scholar at all, inviting actors, authors and political pundits; individuals who, despite their credibility within their own respective fields, were ultimately ill-equipped to handle the conversation in an informed way.
This isn’t the first time that Muslims or Islamic scholars have been left out of key discussions of the faith. On Monday, Fox News host Bill Hemmer discussed Maher’s characterizations of Islam, bringing onto the show Republican pollster Tyler Harber and former pollster for President Bill Clinton, Bernard Whitman. Like Maher’s show, the Fox News conversation ultimately resulted in the three men shouting over one another despite the fact that none of the three have the theological education to truly understand the faith they are discussing. This habit of inviting guests ill-equipped to discuss sensitive subjects such as a major world religion isn’t just limited to comedic shows like Maher’s. It’s now becoming more commonplace on major news networks. Not only is this fundamentally irresponsible on the part of the shows airing such content, but it allows facile arguments like Maher’s to be taken as legitimate analysis — something that is not only problematic, but also grossly inappropriate.
Programs like Maher’s show, which are often geared towards providing infotainment in a satirical way, should always be taken with a grain of salt. But that doesn’t excuse talk shows or news outlets from neglecting to bring credible sources to the discussion table. As religious scholar Reza Aslan, someone with the credibility and education capable of discussing this subject, noted of Maher’s comments on a segment of CNN, “Frankly when it comes to the topic of religion, [Maher is] not very sophisticated in the way that he thinks.”
Perhaps next time, the rest of the news media will heed Aslan’s remark.

Let me be clear, let me state this upfront, and
let me refute your ill-founded opinion that I hate Muslims for this is not a
trivial accusation.  I do NOT hate
Muslims.  But I do hate their
religion.  Muslims are, in fact, Islam’s
first victims and are to be pitied for it.
Islam crushes their ability to spread their wings. To create and be
creative.  To embrace differences and to
embrace others for what they are and whom they are.  Your accusation that I hate Muslims is
both  unfortunate and untrue.
forth as the cause.
For a Muslim to face up to the reality of Islam and to admit to oneself that
Islam is the problem means to lose one’s identity. Hence the cognitive
dissonance Muslims experience when Islam is called into question. Hence the
scrambling for excuses and explanations that can convince the Muslims
themselves that Islam is not the problem. And the explanations tend to be
colonialism, crusades, Jews, racism, and so forth.
When cultural Muslims refer to spurious arguments by Islamic apologists as a
counterargument to brush aside direct quotes from the Qur’an and the hadiths,
it is not that they are deliberately trying to to deceive the non-Muslims. They
are desperately clinging to the hope that Islam is not the problem. When they
repeat the talking points of Islamic apologists explaining how Islam is a
religion of peace, their primary aim is to convince (delude) themselves and
make the cognitive dissonance go away at least momentarily, which then removes
the immediate threat to their identity and postpones the inevitable
confrontation.
Unlike most of the Muslim world, Turkey is a country where, thanks to
militantly secularist strains, there are more Muslims who are not completely
enslaved by their Muslim identity. That gives slightly more breathing space for
the individual to break the chains of Islam. Nonetheless, it still means you have
to turn your back on large parts of your cultural heritage and family. Families
in any culture have members who seek to enforce tradition. In Muslim cultures
the conservative members of the family are enforcers of Muslim identity, which
brings along with it the whole can of worms that is the Qur’an and the hadiths.
