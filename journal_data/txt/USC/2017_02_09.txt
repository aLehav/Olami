Behind standout offensive performances from redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron and sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright, USC routed visiting Oregon State 92-66 on Thursday night at the Galen Center.
Aaron finished with a game high 21 points (4-21, 0-12). He finished Thursday night shooting 5-of-6 from 3-point range. Aaron also reeled in six rebounds for the Trojans in the victory.
“I feel like I’m getting really used to the flow of the game. I feel comfortable out there on the floor now,” Aaron said. “When I get in the game (off of the bench), I just make sure that I do what I need to do for the team.”
Aaron’s 3-pointer late in the second half gave USC a 28-point lead (88-60) with 1:40 minutes remaining in regulation. Overall, Aaron shot 7-of-10 from the field against Oregon State. Aaron’s five 3-point field goals were a career-high.
In his first contest at the Galen Center since returning from an MCL injury in November, Boatwright finished Thursday night with 16 points. Boatwright was a perfect 9-for-9 from the free throw line against the Beavers.
“I’m starting to get my legs under me now, it’s starting to all come back,” Boatwright said.
With the blowout victory, USC has now won five consecutive Pac-12 games for the first time since the 2002 season. USC has averaged 85.2 points per game during the five game winning streak.
“We’ve found a way to put together some good conference wins this season,” Enfield said. “We had a tough start to conference play shooting the ball, but we found ways to win games.”
Thursday night’s victory puts the Trojans (21-4 overall) at an 8-4 record in conference play.
Overall, USC finished the game shooting 28-of-55 (51 percent) from the field. The Trojans concluded the game by converting on six of their final seven shot attempts.
Four USC players finished in double-digits scoring — Aaron, Boatwright, junior guard Elijah Stewart with 14 points and sophomore forward Chimezie Metu with 11 points.
After falling behind 6-0 in the opening minute of regulation, the Trojans went on a 16-4 run that pulled them ahead of the Beavers. A 3-pointer from junior point guard McLaughlin four minutes into regulation gave USC a 10-8 lead that they would not surrender for the remainder of the contest.
A 16-5 run from USC over the final nine minutes of the first half gave the Trojans a 44-27 lead at the break.
After opening the game shooting 9-of-15 from the field, Oregon State finished the first half by missing 17 of its final 19 first half shot attempts. USC held the Beavers scoreless in the final 4:23 of the opening half.
“We did a great job getting our hands on the basketball defensively tonight,” Enfield said. “We were able to block shots, deflect passes … it was a real good defensive effort from us tonight.”
The Trojans opened the game firing on all cylinders offensively. In the first nine minutes of the first half they shot 6-for-8 from the 3-point line.
USC opened the game shooting 7-of-9 from the field as they retook the lead early on. USC shot 12-for-12 from the free throw line in the first half. Overall, the Trojans shot 26-for-31 (84 percent) from the foul line.
A 13-5 run from Oregon State midway through the second half pulled the Beavers within 11 points of USC.
However, the Beavers would not get within single digits of the Trojans the entire second half.
USC’s 92 points scored Thursday were its most in a Pac-12 game this season.
Behind Aaron’s 21 points off of the bench, USC’s bench outscored Oregon State’s, 39-14. Metu contributed on the glass with seven total rebounds. Overall, the Trojans outrebounded the Beavers by a margin of 37-30.
USC freshman forward Nick Rakocevic had a career-high four blocks Thursday. The Trojans, as a team, compiled seven total blocks defensively.
USC capitalized on Oregon State’s offensive mishaps Thursday night. The Trojans outscored the Beavers in points off of turnovers, 20-3. Hustle points were also in favor of the Trojans, as USC outscored Oregon State in second chance points 14-3.
The Trojans will remain at home for their upcoming matchup with the visiting No. 5 Oregon Ducks (21-4, 10-2). The Ducks are coming off of an 82-79 loss to No. 10 UCLA Thursday night.
USC will look to extend its Pac-12 winning streak to six games and avenge its Dec. 30 84-61 loss to Oregon Saturday night at home.
“You’d much rather be on a five-game winning streak than a five-game losing streak going into a game like this one,” Enfield said. “[Oregon’s] a great team and they’re good on the road. We have our hands full with them, so we are going to be ready to compete. It helps that we’ve been playing well. Our players are confident, and it’s on our home floor.”

The women’s basketball team seemed to have turned a corner when they defeated Arizona and Arizona State two weeks ago, but back-to-back losses to Stanford and Cal place them back at the drawing board. Sitting at eleventh  in the Pac-12, the team will look to rebound this weekend with road games against No. 9 Oregon State and Oregon.
“All we can do is stick to the game plan,” redshirt senior guard Alexis Lloyd said. “We had two tough losses against Stanford and Cal, but we have six games left to do the best we can.”
This weekend’s excursion to the state of Oregon marks the team’s second consecutive road trip. Overall, the Trojans play only two home games in February, with one final trip to Arizona at the end of the month. Currently, USC sits at 0-5 in conference road games since January.
“I wouldn’t say it’s affected our performance,” Lloyd said about the team’s play on the road. “I just think we need to do a better job of executing. It’s tough playing anywhere on the road, but we just have to do a better job of focusing and coming together as one to execute and finish the goal which is to win.”
The Trojans will hope for better results than when they played both Oregon and Oregon State at the Galen Center last month. The Trojans lost 59-53 to the Ducks in head-scratching fashion after holding a 16-point lead at halftime. Then they were thoroughly handled by the Beavers, losing by 14 to the conference’s top team. Currently Oregon State is 22-2 and poised for a potentially deep run in the NCAA Tournament.
In order to exact revenge against two quality teams from the Beaver State, USC will likely need to find offense outside of junior forward Kristen Simon. In the two recent losses to Stanford and Cal, Simon averaged 17.5 points, accounting for over one-third of her team’s scoring effort. Meanwhile, only one other Trojan managed a double-figure game, with freshman guard Minyon Moore notching 10 points against Stanford. Against No. 8 Stanford, the team scored a season-low 42, shooting 31.3 percent from the field.
“Everyone just needs to contribute,” Lloyd said. “Everybody has a role and we need to play the part of getting the ball inside-out because sometimes teams double, triple-team Kristen. So if we can get the ball inside-out, it would help her offensively.”
USC now has a limited amount of time to right the ship before the Pac-12 Tournament begins on March 2 in Seattle. After starting off 10-2 in non-conference play, they have lost nine of their last 12 Pac-12 games. With four teams represented in the AP top-15, the overall strength of the Pac-12 has not helped USC’s cause.
After contests at Oregon State and Oregon, USC returns to the Galen Center next weekend for games against Washington State and Washington. They have just six games remaining before conference championship play begins.

For anyone who knows me, there’s no question that I love sports. But there is a phrase — other than “the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead” — that I absolutely abhor, whether it’s online or in person: “Stick to sports.”
While sports journalism is my specialty, I consider myself a journalist first, as do many fellow sports media members that I follow on Twitter. But I see it all the time, when a “sportswriter” has the gall to tweet about politics or lifestyle or something other than sports: “Stick to sports.”
It also applies to athletes. Whenever a famous athlete — like LeBron James or Stephen Curry — dares to venture opinions outside of their profession, they are met with a tirade from brave social media warriors: “Stick to sports.”
It is not only incredibly naive, but also condescending and insulting, treating “us” — the collective sports world — like we aren’t qualified to discuss anything beyond sports.
This is especially relevant in today’s charged political climate. As the nation grapples with a Donald Trump presidency, we’ve seen athletes use their platforms to make their opinions heard. We’ve seen sportswriters who usually don’t stray from their beat throw their hats into the political ring.
Tim Kawakami, a long-time sports columnist for the San Jose Mercury News whom I grew up reading and fills my timeline with daily sports opinions and analysis, tweeted about Trump’s immigration ban last month.
“My mother was born in America, but was put in an internment camp during World War II as a child, for no reason except fear & hatred,” he said.
It was retweeted over 1,300 times, and showcased the broader point that just because our main domain is sports does not mean that we don’t have opinions or interests outside of sporting events.
Unfortunately, it feels like we in the sports media too often surround ourselves in a sports bubble, trapped by the notion that we are specifically “sports” media, too afraid to venture into the real world. I can’t tell you how many times I have wanted to comment on social media about a breaking news story, only to think, “I’m a sportswriter. People follow me for sports reasons, so they’ll think it’s weird, and someone will probably tell me to stick to sports,” and hit the backspace button.
Sure, covering sports is how we dip our feet into the media world. It’s part of our job description, it’s what we’re paid to do and why people read our articles. But to limit ourselves only perpetuates the “stick to sports” perspective — one that paints sportswriters as unable to opine about anything else but sports, oblivious to the world around them.
However, the Trump administration is giving athletes — and sportswriters — the impetus to come out of their shells. “A sportswriter doesn’t have to ‘stick to sports’ if the athletes don’t,” Bryan Curtis, the editor-at-large at the Ringer, wrote last month.
And athletes and coaches, thankfully, have not. In a trend that started last year with Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem to protest race relations, prominent sports figures have felt emboldened by the current political climate. Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr, two of the most respected coaches in the NBA, spoke out vehemently against Trump’s travel ban. LeBron James, the best basketball player in the world, called it “un-American.” Curry, the defending two-time MVP and face of Under Armour who usually avoids making controversial public statements, had the best line when asked about Under Armour chief executive Kevin Plank’s comment that Trump was a “real asset” to the country.
“I agree with that description, if you remove the -et,’” Curry said to the Mercury News.
Curry, who could be worth a reported $14.1 billion to Under Armour and is signed with them until 2024, went on to say that he wouldn’t have a problem with abandoning the brand if its platform wasn’t in line with his views.
Such political statements from superstar athletes have opened a window for the sports media to write stories outside the traditional norm of sports, to speak more freely on social media and be more willing to question athletes on their non-sports views.
Tom Brady, now considered the greatest quarterback of all time after another Super Bowl win, caught a lot of flak when a “Make America Great Again” hat was spotted in his locker last year. He was criticized even more when he brushed aside questions during Super Bowl media day regarding his support for Trump by saying he was a positive person who didn’t know what was going in the world and wasn’t paying attention to news events like the immigration ban or the women’s march (yes, actually).
Ultimately, it’s up to the person. If Brady wants to keep his political opinions out of the media, he has the right to do so. And sportswriters shouldn’t necessarily feel compelled to voice their political stances when that’s not what they’re paid to do. Nonetheless, it is important that athletes and the media who cover them aren’t afraid to step out and use their platforms, especially at a time when political activism is spiking. And it’s just as important that people respect those opinions and not dismiss them as simply comments from a “dumb jock” or an “out-of-touch, multi-millionaire athlete.”
I’ll leave you with what Martellus Bennett, one of five New England Patriots not-so-subtly skipping the team’s post-Super Bowl visit to the White House, tweeted about the labels placed on him.
“When you look at me what do you see? I know you wanna ask me what sport I play. I mean what else could I possibly be besides an athlete,” Bennett said. “When you look at me see the father, the awesome dad, the author, film director, business owner, champion, friend, Hufflepuff beast.”
Yes, athletes are committed to sports, as are those who write about them. But we can — and should — treat ourselves and, likewise, be treated as so much more. Never just “stick to sports.” Please, never do.

David Cole, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, visited the USC Gould School of Law on Thursday to speak about the future of civil liberties in the midst of the Trump administration.
Formerly a professor of law at Georgetown University, Cole was named as the new national legal director for the ACLU in January. He replaced Steven R. Shapiro, who served as legal director for the ACLU from 1993 to 2016. Cole will now oversee the work of nearly 300 lawyers and lead the ACLU’s efforts in the Supreme Court. For the past 96 years, the ACLU has been involved in nearly every landmark Supreme Court case regarding political expression, freedom of speech or press and the separation of church and state.
Professor Nomi Stolzenberg, who has been teaching at the USC Gould School of Law since 1988, moderated the discussion.
Stolzenberg said that the executive orders signed by President Donald Trump have the potential to undo Obama administration policies. She asked Cole for the top issues on ACLU’s list.
Cole explained that the ACLU will deal with many issues, including reproductive freedom, national security and voting rights. However, immigration will be a priority.
Cole discussed Trump’s immigration ban, the legality of the executive order and the ACLU’s plans to fight it. Cole explained that the ACLU is looking to focus on aiding immigrants and those affected by Trump’s executive order. He sees the ban as religious favoritism — or “dis-favoritism” — which he claims is nonsensical in the context of the Constitution’s establishment clause, which prohibits the government from favoring any one religion.
Cole believes that the federal court can only do so much. The true work of the reform, he said, lies with the citizens who are impassioned by the issues and want to see change. Some part of this change comes from supporting organizations like the ACLU.
Over the course of a decade, the ACLU has grown to over one million members. Since Trump’s election, it has received one million online donations that average about $79 each.
“People want to engage,” Cole said.
The only viable way to stop Trump’s series of executive actions, Cole believes, is for citizens to band together and continue the activism shown at the women’s marches and airport protests nationwide.
“There is a broad swath of people who are showing their concern, and that plays a role in how the courts react,” Cole said.
Cole acknowledged that the Trump administration will present many challenges. But public opposition has left him optimistic about the future.
“The real moving force of constitutional law is the people, organized through institutions that care about particular constitutional values,” Cole said.
Illegal immigration by foreign nationals is not a constitutionally protected right.

Latino immigrants and African American men have the highest number of people working dangerous jobs, according to a new study conducted by the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics and the Keck School of Medicine of USC.
The researchers found that for men between the ages of 18 and 64, Latino immigrants have the highest percentage of workplace injury with around 13.7 per 1,000 workers. They are followed by African American men with 12.1 per 1,000 and U.S.-born Latino men with nearly 12 per 1,000 workers. Asian American men, and white men averaged below 12 per 1,000 people.
The elevated workplace risk goes hand-in-hand with higher disability rates as well, especially for older workers aged 50 to 64. Within this age bracket, African Americans have a 4.4 percent rate of work-related disability, followed by Latino immigrants at 4.2 percent.
Even accounting for education and demographic characteristics, the difference is due mainly to disparities in economic opportunities for minorities. According to the study, this forces people of color to take more hazardous jobs with a higher risk of disability or injury, according to the study. Some likely factors that may contribute to these disparities include a bias in assigning minority workers the most dangerous tasks or discrimination when it comes to hiring and promotion practices.
Historically, minorities have worked under some of the worst conditions, and though the United States has made tremendous progress in improving safety measures and reducing on-the-job injuries, the findings indicate that disparities do still exist.
However, the study also reported that investing more in lowering injury is expensive and could potentially lead employers to lower wages or curtail job opportunities. The researchers noted that efforts toward increasing workplace safety should not come at the expense of reduced opportunities for already vulnerable minorities.

More than 70 years have passed since the end of World War II, but USC’s expanded collection of wartime artifacts may soon be able to offer new historical insights.
David and Andrea Stanley donated hundreds of items to USC Libraries and the USC Shoah Foundation’s Center for Advanced Genocide Research. The objects came from Andrea Stanley’s father Harry Wolff, Jr., an American Jewish soldier who served in Europe during the war, and includes numerous paper documents that depict Wolff’s wartime experiences.
The documents include around 500 letters exchanged between Wolff and his wife Natalie Rosow. In the letters, Wolff describes his time training as a member of the “C” Gun Battalion in the 3rd Army, as well as his combat experience at Dachau where he guarded German prisoners. These letters also recount his time attending the war crime trials that occurred after the war was over.
The letters are unredacted and the papers go into specific detail about Wolff’s emotional wellbeing during the war. They describe how Wolff strived to preserve his composure even in dangerous situations. He also mentioned his need to stay in control and support others during difficult times.
Wolf Gruner, the founding director of the Center for Advanced Genocide Research and the Shapell-Guerin Chair in Jewish Studies, explained in USC’s Visual History Archive that the collection holds significant historical value because of the firsthand reports that Wolff provided.
“We gladly took this collection because in every letter, Lieutenant  Wolff told his new wife, Natalie Rosow, where he got the artifacts from and how he got them and what they mean, which is unusual,” Gruner told USC News.
Gruner said that Wolff’s ability to document his experiences is furthermore remarkable due to the fact that ink was in short supply. His letter-writing activity was also often kept secret. Regardless, Wolff continued to write to his wife almost every single day.
Andrea Stanley said in an interview with USC News, the letters are delicately phrased in order to diminish some of the horrors that took place during the war. Wolff made an effort to protect his wife by including pleasant thoughts. He would describe non-war-related events, such as his efforts to engage in Jewish High Holy Day services.
In addition, the collection contains love notes and letters that Wolff sent home inquiring about his friends’ and family’s wellbeing.
The collection also contains a variety of Nazi artifacts, including flags and medals. Wolff was able to bring back military and civilian newspapers, brochures and photographs.
The collection includes a shard of a swastika that was arranged on top of the Nuremberg Stadium. In 1945, the stadium was famously blown up by U.S. and Russian troops.
Students said that they appreciated the chance to learn about World War II firsthand.
“I am grateful that this collection can expose me to the experiences of a World War II veteran,” said Isabella Dake, a freshman majoring in theatre. “Thanks to the USC Library and Shoah Foundation, I am able to witness history on a tangible level.”
This collection contributes to Gruner’s aim to increase the amount of resources USC has on genocide studies. Since the Center was established in 2014, USC has acquired the original transcript of the Nuremberg trials, along with other diaries, letters and books.
This World War II material is accessible for researchers and students.
“I am impressed by the amount of material USC provides me with in my studies,” said Danielle Hazime, a freshman majoring in human biology and a writer for the Daily Trojan. “Never do I feel like my learning is inhibited by insufficient resources.”

On Wednesday, Grammy award-winning producer David Banner stepped onstage to address an enthusiastic, passionate crowd of hundreds in his discussion, “Activism in Post-Obama America,” hosted by the California African American Museum in Exposition Park.
The venue reached full capacity for this popular event. Many late arrivals gathered outside, watching through tinted windows and hoping to catch a glimpse of the renowned producer and activist.
Banner commanded the stage in a bright salmon sweater and blue jeans. His casual appearance created an open and welcoming atmosphere between himself and the crowd even before the lecture began.
Banner began his talk casually, walking through the crowd, taking selfies with audience members and cracking jokes into the microphone. However, he immediately switched gears as he dove into the meat of his argument.
The crowd quieted down, as phones were tucked away and recordings paused. Banner explicitly told the crowd he did not want any phones present during his talk — he did not want to be recorded.
It wasn’t that Banner didn’t want his speech to be accessible to an audience greater than the crowd in the lobby, but Banner argued that change will not occur in the comfort of one’s living room. If a member of the audience were to record his speech and watch it from their home, the entire discussion would be ineffective, Banner said.
After earning his audience’s full attention, Banner began to discuss the current political climate of the United States and how this present state came to be. He said he was not confused as to why Trump was elected; instead, he sought to explain the events that foreshadowed this election outcome.
Banner addressed former President Barack Obama’s symbolic concept of change — void of any concrete approaches to solutions for the black community. Banner said that because so many voters bought into Obama’s vision for change, there was less of an urgency to act out and ensure the rights of their people.
According to Banner, Trump is the best thing to ever happen to black people.
“We’ve never been so angry, and if we do not work to make a change, we will perish,” Banner said.
Banner segued into the importance of molding the future generation of Americans from this topic of change. This form of activism, Banner thought, would be a great starting point. Instead of bullying, condemning and shaming others, Banner suggests treating people like gods.
“What if we taught our children that they’re gods?” Banner asked.
In an attempt to answer, Banner predicted that maybe these children would start acting like gods, so they will be treated like gods.
Banner had unique perspectives and ways of thinking about certain issues. One of his points with regards to activism was self-love. He urged the black community to love themselves before they could help anyone else. He used his own culture’s appearance to explain this. Banner emphasized the beauty of black culture and described its connection to God.
Banner talked about the prevalence of faith in his community, but he rejected the idea of letting God take over. He claimed that action must be taken by individuals themselves.
Throughout his entire speech, Banner never demanded the audience’s attention. He never forced his own opinions down the crowd’s throat, nor did he say his opinions were necessarily right. Instead, Banner asked for his audience to just consider his words and independently think for themselves. Banner often told the audience to stop amid their clapping and challenged them to think if they truly agreed with what he was saying.
Banner touched on racism throughout his speech. He expressed that the problem did not stem from the racism of other communities, but rather the lack of racism in the black community. Banner did not mean to say that the black community should act deliberately racist, but rather demand change and act to improve their situations. His suggestions for change came in the form of three solutions.
“[The black community should] gain knowledge of the self and their own God, be able to produce [their] own goods and to love [themselves] before being able to do anything for [themselves],” Banner said.
Though Banner’s speech went in several different directions, his main points came across decently well.
His only intention was to inspire his audience to take action for themselves. Banner emphasized that change starts from within, and once individuals are able to help themselves, then they can start helping others.

I didn’t think my “Before and After” column title would ever be so pertinent. But here I am — writing four days after the end of my relationship. Last Friday, Jake saw me checking my column on the Daily Trojan website and laughed at the headline “Confessions of a Serial Ghoster.” I got embarrassed and pulled my phone away, and when I apologized half an hour later, he said he’d already forgotten. But I know he knows where to find my column online. This week, part of me hopes he does.
But I know Valentine’s Day is coming up. In that sense, this isn’t really for Jake. This is for those who are hurting.
Day One: Jake arrived on my porch and didn’t kiss or hug me. Instead of coming inside, he asked to go for a walk. I laughed to myself because this seemed like a breakup (we were deeply in love and only four months in). We’d had a long conversation about communication on the phone the night before and when he had offered to come spend the night with me, I told him to stay where he was and focus on his work.
But on day one, he kept repeating, “I didn’t sleep last night.” I thought maybe someone had died. Instead, he took me right outside my gate and through tears he said, “Babe, I think we should break up.” He’d come to this conclusion since the phone call. I can’t help but wonder whether things would have been different if I had let him come over.
It lasted 30 minutes. I listened, waiting for closure, until I couldn’t listen any more. Then I turned away and walked inside. I caught his reflection in my front door window — a picture I knew would be the last — and went to my room to cry. My parents called to talk about my health issues. I told them I couldn’t talk because Jake broke up with me 12 minutes before. My mom said she’d expected more of him. I agreed. She asked if anyone saw it coming. My roommate, who was holding my hand, started to laugh. No one saw it coming.
I finally finished my Writing 340 draft that afternoon. I did readings for the upcoming week. We went to Ralph’s and my friends bought me a 6-foot plush caterpillar toy. I felt fine but was scared about what would happen when I went to bed.
I tried to fall asleep by counting backwards from 100 in French, but kept seeing his swollen, crying face and hearing the words, “Babe, I think we should break up” every time I closed my eyes. I woke up constantly throughout the night only to see that same image in my mind. In the morning, I threw up three times. The irony that he began that sentence with “babe” is not lost on me.
Day Two: After throwing up, I wrote in my new journal. At one point during our last conversation, I reminded Jake that once things ended, I wouldn’t speak to him. He told me I could write him a letter. So I wrote the letter. I called him the one word that had escaped me on day one: coward.
I approached my roommate Amy and asked her to sit with me; I finally let myself feel everything. On day one I felt confused, but day two I felt hurt. The week before, I had found out that I was ill again and how my illness was related to chemotherapy and my reproductive system.
Jake said we were incompatible. He couldn’t be there for me, and the timing was quite clear: I know this means Jake couldn’t handle it. So he bailed.
In Amy’s arms, I admitted how rejected and vulnerable I felt. I know I did nothing to deserve his weakness, but Jake hit me where it hurt the most.
I went to an interview and got offered an internship. I kept telling myself success was the best revenge, but an hour later I started wishing I could tell Jake the good news. Then I saw a video on Facebook of an otter sliding down a hill. I wanted to show that to him as well.
I tried my best to finish my dinner; I told two more friends what happened, and I cried and hugged my new caterpillar toy. My friend Lara, who had befriended Jake, cried too. We sat on my bed and shook our heads over the callous cowardice of the boy I’d grown to love and trust.
I slept more soundly on night two, but I had a nightmare about my upcoming surgery and how Jake won’t be there.
Day Three: I woke up feeling sick to my stomach again, but I got a job offer in my email. I ate a piece of toast and threw up five times more.
I still haven’t decided whether he broke my heart or whether this is just what it’s like to be abandoned.
Day Four: I decided to take a deep breath and keep going.

What you’re feeling is something that all of us go through at one time or another.  Time heals these types of wounds.  I think it took a lot of courage for Jake to recognize the incompatibility and break it off sooner rather than later.  Imagine if you two stayed together for a couple of years?  I bet you’d feel even worse after having spent that much time together only to break up in the end.  You will find someone else.  Fight on…

Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner, better known by his stage name Sting, illuminated the stage with his performance at the Hollywood Palladium on Feb. 8. The  sixth  concert of Sting’s world tour, the show promoted his latest album, 57th & 9th.
The crowd waited in anticipation for his appearance after his son Joe Sumner and The Last Bandoleros opened up the house. As Sting took to the stage, hundreds of cellphones and cameras raised above heads as an aura of excitement filled the room. Chants and hollers were met with the instrumental opening of “Synchronicity II” by The Police (Sting’s old band), and the crowd was immediately engrossed by what was happening onstage before them.
Though Sting is technically a solo act, he did not let much time pass before introducing the band that supports and plays with him — Dominic Miller and his son Rufus Miller on guitars and Josh Freese on drums, while Sting is on bass and lead vocals. However the father-son duo between the Millers was not the only one present. Onstage, Sting was accompanied by his eldest son, Joe Sumner, and The Last Bandoleros on backup vocals.
With the crowd warmed up from older songs by The Police, Sting began to thread in six of the 10 tracks on his most recent album.
Sting not only used the audience to fuel the energy on the stage, but he also played off the energy of his bandmates. In the second song of the night, “Spirits in the Material World,” Sting sent the energy to Rufus Miller who hekl a guitar solo following the chorus. Following Rufus was his father, Dominic, in the next chorus, who held his own guitar solo. The energy continued to bounce between Sting and the bandmates for the entirety of the concert.
Multiple times throughout the concert, the lighting enhanced the performance onstage. The color choice not only matched the lyrics — red lights during “Roxanne” were a telling choice — but  the drum sequence also matched perfectly during the lyrics, “Now don’t you worry your pretty little petrol head / Pretty little petrol head” in “Petrol Head,”  a song on 57th & 9th. Sting also got the crowd involved with the help of lighting design. In “Message in a Bottle,” the white stage lights turned out towards the audience to get them clapping along with the beat.
By the end of the show, Sting had performed five songs by The Police, one song by David Bowie and eleven of his own songs. Closing with “Roxanne,” and remixing it with “Ain’t No Sunshine” by Bill Winthers, Sting fully earned the boisterous demand for an encore. He then performed two more songs by The Police — “Next to You” and “Every Breath You Take” — once again rightfully earning a demand for an encore. Giving in, Sting once again took the stage again, this time for his second encore, and sang “The Empty Chair,” only accompanied  by his own acoustic guitar.
Sting is a truly gifted artist. His live songs matched, and even sometimes surpassed, the quality of sound of his studio recordings. He did not falter or become frustrated when audio completely cut out during “I’m So Happy I Can’t Stop Crying.” He actively got the audience involved, clapping and singing along to his songs. And he had people, young and old, dancing the entire show. These characteristics set the artists apart from the performers. Sting is not merely a performer who comes to put on a show. Rather, he is an artist that arrives to create art onstage.

I exited the Student Union through locked wooden doors, greeting the evening fog four floors beneath the Daily Trojan office, to find a student alone — standing on Trousdale Parkway, studying a campaign poster and reading  its platform points. The poster belonged to a USG Senate candidate.
It shocked me, if for a brief second. I never thought anyone really read those — not for real information, at least. Hadn’t he decided who to support? Hadn’t he read the posts, platforms and debate blurbs? Unfortunately, not everyone is so interested in who writes the rules that will govern their lives, from federal agencies down to student government. Not everyone is political.
So for those of us that are, it is a hard pill to swallow. After a particularly divisive, vitriolic and controversial national election, and similarly divisive, vitriolic and controversial USG campaign season, it is difficult for many young politicos not to feel as though they are drowning in comparisons. One blow of the dishonored democracy, another of the disillusioned student government. All the same problems.
After the 2016 election, we swore to be active, engaged and angry — we swore to get informed and pay attention. All good, all necessary. But  getting informed, paying attention and remaining active do not only apply to national politics. Look locally, we said. Pay attention to Los Angeles. Pay attention to California. But what about what was most local — who ever paid attention to USG?
So here’s the truth: There will be no greater political understanding, no solutions found, no compromises met and no progress made until the young people that will very soon inherit this nation begin to understand applied politics in a general sense — the wind and water of the political landscape, its floods, droughts and all. We must understand why, in a completely different election among a much smaller electorate of much more comparable leanings and circumstances, we saw everything over again: An unquestionably qualified yet flawed insider lacking constituents’ trust; a popular outsider lacking experience who represents the mistrust of establishment. Accusations of a dishonest media. Institutional endorsements versus individual energy.
We didn’t learn from those national lessons. We didn’t look at ourselves and ask if our reading of a USG presidential ticket is based on the same misguided reasonings or universal political forces that swayed our most recent, and historically greatest, national embarrassment — or if USG was prey to the same forces.  We saw a lack of civic engagement and understanding of what the “establishment” really comprised, a disconnect between government and people, a social media frenzy of half-true information and a system perhaps flawed but not necessarily in need of revolution — all should sound familiar. Civic engagement is not just about understanding the issues. It is about understanding politics. And largely, we have yet to attain that.
It seems that very few who disparage USG — its “corruption,” its “nepotism,” its closed-shop culture and its inaction — actually attempted to find information about its processes and its successes. Who stayed informed about the progress of the Edwin-Austin administration before this election? How many, as constituents, truly attempted to hold the student government accountable? Ignorance about its accomplishments should not equate to an accusation that it has accomplished nothing at all. Did white rural voters crying “economy!” next to their Trumpian racism actually know that former President Barack Obama and the Democrats cut unemployment by more than half and created a national economy of historic strength? On the other hand, we also haven’t seen too many USG officials admit the need for greater transparency.
Similarly, did those who logged into their Facebooks to casually denigrate the Daily Trojan — which has served this campus diligently and honestly for over one hundred years — actually take a minute to read the articles about the campaigns, the sanctions and their endorsements, and judge independently whether their facts were accurate? Is “biased media” the rallying cry we learned from 2016? I certainly hope it doesn’t last for long. When CNN and others reported on President Donald Trump’s p-ssy comment, Trumplings also cried “fake news.” If media is still the target, we clearly have not learned.
The USG elections, much like the presidential race,  have left me with one lingering feeling — an overwhelming sense of disillusionment. We succumbed to a lack of information to grow an anti-establishment base; we gave up our responsibility as informed constituents to stop our student government from becoming something we didn’t like; we blamed our media when we should have looked at our representatives and ourselves. It is my sincere hope that whoever wins, this campus is at least satisfied with it. In the meantime, we must reflect.

Are we really going to incentivize voting with In-N-Out, and then complain that people don’t care about the issues? If we want people to care when they vote, then we should only want them to vote when they care. No incentives.

Each Trojan has a unique sense of identity. Sometimes, it can be difficult for students to adequately express their individuality, and so they resort to using common labels to describe themselves. Titles like liberal, conservative, straight, queer and many others require only a brief conversation to tease out of a fellow student. But the implications of those labels can be dramatically different depending on who is hearing them. For many people, it seems that if somebody disagrees with one’s core values, there is little reason to continue interacting with them other than to deride them. “Queer” is turned into “snowflake,” “conservative” morphs into “alt-right” and people retreat back into their like-minded bubbles to seek reaffirmation.
In doing so, however, students seem to forget that we all have at least one thing in common — we are Trojans. We all were admitted to this university because we embodied the five traits of a Trojan — faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous and ambitious. But there really should be a sixth trait of a Trojan: respectful. USC’s administration has done a wonderful job of creating a vibrant community of people from innumerable, breathtaking backgrounds. Even students who appear to be stereotypical at first glance often have deeply personal narratives — narratives that ought to be heard by their fellow students. In light of this, students should be slow to judge each other and quick to seek understanding of one another — now more than ever.
Each Trojan brings the sum of their life experience to campus every day, and differences in life experience often drive students to varying conclusions about education, life and politics. Students ought to view this diversity of thought as a resource, not a liability. The guy wearing a “Make America Great Again” baseball hat walking on Trousdale Parkway and the outspoken queer feminist in a GE class both probably have compelling reasons for thinking the way they do. It may not be immediately clear — and therefore easy to assume that they don’t — because those students haven’t been given a chance to explain their perspectives. Writing off students like that as ignorant, as irritating or — worse — unworthy of one’s time does them a disservice and damages the unity of the Trojan Family.
Regardless of if a student is “right,” “left” or somewhere in between, we are all Trojans. Trojans will share the same campus for years, after all, so we ought to make the most of the time we have together. The first step in that direction is choosing to seek common ground with and to be respectful of fellow students. There are undoubtedly certain things that most Trojans can agree on; it is only a matter of finding them and understanding why we agree. It may be that our concerns and priorities are not so disparate after all, but we will never know if we do not engage in dialogue with one another and withhold judgment. The desire to tackle issues like poverty, food and water security, health quality and many other “wicked problems” identified by Provost Michael Quick very likely forms our common foundation here at USC.
The terms “right wing” and “left wing” were created in the era of the French Revolution in order to refer to opposing groups in the French Legislative Assembly. Those who sat on the right were usually conservative, those who sat on the left were usually liberal. In contemporary politics, the terms are often used to describe people who oppose one’s own views. Yet, to use a metaphor, a bird needs both the left and the right wing to work in concert in order to soar. So, too, does our university community, the United States and the world. There needs to be cooperation and moderation between different groups. There must be dialogue aimed at moving the collective onward and upward. And it all starts with us.
So talk with somebody different today — doing so just might start a beneficial movement.

Photo from USC News
John Thomas’s office captures every significant experience in his life. His shelf teems with the awards and honors he earned as a police officer. A framed photo of him shaking hands with former president Barack Obama hangs near the door. The walls are decorated with black-and-white photos of Los Angeles Police Department figures, reflecting his passion for history.
Thomas is the chief of the Department of Public Safety, where he is responsible for overseeing more than 300 personnel who work 365 days a year. Born and raised in South Central Los Angeles, he was no stranger to USC when he joined DPS back in October 2006. Prior to that, he served in the LAPD for 21 years.
He considered attending law school after college, but felt compelled to join the LAPD because he believed it was the best way to make a tangible, everyday difference in people’s lives. He said that his own negative encounters with the police also contributed to his desire to improve the dynamics of police interactions with members of minority groups.
“I used to get stopped commuting for school between Westwood and South Central,” Thomas said. “I remember clearly an officer telling me that I had no business being anywhere west of La Cienega.”
During his time with the LAPD, Thomas was a part of the department’s Gang Enforcement Detail in South Los Angeles, and completed undercover narcotics enforcement assignments. He was tasked with infiltrating drug rings, purchasing narcotics and organizing search warrants. One of the locations he monitored in East Los Angeles was a hub for heroin, which he said exposed him to how deeply crime could damage communities.
“The worst thing I saw was the impact [of drug crimes] on kids,” Thomas said. “The kids would have to walk to school surrounded by heroin needles.”
Thomas thought that universities could be doing more to address the social issues linked to crime and help at-risk youths by providing them with opportunities and resources. To this end, Thomas retired from the LAPD as a lieutenant and decided to pursue a career in campus policing. After retiring, he became the deputy chief of police for the University of the District of Columbia for a year before moving back to Los Angeles He said that his role with DPS is very different from his previous role with the LAPD.
“We’re constantly educating the transitory student population,” Thomas said. “I think we do more educating than enforcing.”   
However, for Thomas, the job of DPS chief comes with dark and difficult moments. In recent years, certain crimes — such as the 2014 murder of Chinese graduate student Xinran Ji — have caused USC’s administration to augment security measures around campus. Thomas said he takes any tragedy that happens personally, and says he’ll never forget when he had to speak with Ji’s parents.
“No parent sends their kid to any university and expects that. Instead of coming to a graduation, they’ll be coming to make funeral arrangements and claim the body,” Thomas said.
After that incident, Thomas realized that DPS shouldn’t practice a “one size fits all” approach to educating students about crime. He understood that the department should account for differences in students’ cultures and mindsets. Thomas emphasized that this mentality is especially important now, amid tension around President Donald Trump’s new administration. Thomas’ priority is to ensure that each individual student feels safe and that their constitutional rights are being protected.
Going forward, Thomas’ goal is for USC to be recognized as the safest urban campus in America. He believes the best way to achieve this is by improving relationships between DPS and USC students, DPS and the local community and USC students and the local community. 
He is a big proponent of programs like the Neighborhood Academic Initiative and the DPS Cadet Program because he believes that any area’s level of safety depends on its inhabitants having a good quality of life.
“We need to make sure that everybody who lives around USC feels like they have a stake in USC — that there’s something special about being part of this campus community,” Thomas said.
