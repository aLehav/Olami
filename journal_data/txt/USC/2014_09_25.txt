Enough about Boston College already.
As one of the sports editors of this newspaper, I’ve read the phrase, “Coming off a 37-31 loss to unranked Boston College, the 18th-ranked Trojan football team is focused on preparing for Oregon State” countless times over the past two weeks, and I’ve been guilty of inserting it into other people’s stories as well.
But when you think about it, that game — that terrible, horrible, no good, very bad game — happened a full two weeks ago.
So much has happened in the world since USC’s last loss: Jameis Winston yelled a hilariously obscene phrase and got suspended for a game, the iPhone 6 was released and that one guy dropped it immediately, Roger Goodell held a mostly useless press conference and Amber Rose filed for divorce from Wiz Khalifa. Important stuff here, people.
Though many Trojan fans still aren’t quite over the humiliation that resulted from the upset at the hands of the Eagles, rest assured the team has put its head down and worked every day since then to improve and to make sure something like that doesn’t happen again.
The Trojans showed impressive resilience in the face of chaos last year — they never lost consecutive games despite going through three head coaches.
Such was not the case in 2012, though, as the Trojans limped to the finish line with three straight losses and five losses out of their last six games. Surely USC’s football team has learned a great deal since then and will come out on Saturday night ready to go.
Just because I feel like throwing more stats at you, I’d also like to share that the Trojans are 4-1 coming off the bye in their last five seasons, with their sole loss coming to then-top-ranked Oregon in November 2010, a game in which Oregon’s LaMichael James rushed for 239 yards.
Though that loss came at the hands of a superior team at the time, USC’s loss at Boston College did not. In the few days after the game, sophomore safety Su’a Cravens confirmed what many Trojan fans feared.
“We let the glamor of being in the top 10 get to us and that didn’t last very long,” Cravens told Scott Wolf of the Los Angeles Daily News. “The whole week we were off. We were lackadaisical and a little bit too nonchalant. We overlooked [Boston College].”
After dropping down to No. 17 in the AP Poll and sliding to No. 18 following the bye, the Trojans are no longer in a glamorous position. And despite Oregon State being unranked, USC knows it cannot overlook this undefeated Beaver squad.
Boston College had just been beaten by 10 at home against Pitt, and the Trojans were riding high after an upset of then-No. 13 Stanford.
USC is back to square one. The squad started the season ranked No. 15 by the Associated Press and was selected to finish second in the Pac-12 South. Today, the Trojans are ranked No. 18 in the AP poll and third in the Pac-12 South.
The Trojans will have to dig themselves out of their current hole if they want to achieve their goal of being Pac-12 South champions and live up to their legacy by making the new college football playoffs.
In a way, this weekend’s game against the Beavers gives the Trojans a chance to start fresh — it’s like a new season. Some projected that USC could go undefeated through its first games, so it’s not far-fetched to think that the Trojans could at least win their next seven and go 9-1 instead, should they beat the Beavers this weekend and the dangerous Arizona State Sun Devils next Saturday.
After Arizona State, USC faces five unranked Pac-12 teams before heading across town to take on the (overrated) UCLA Bruins. Since nobody has vocalized this yet, I’ll be the first to say UCLA does not look that good this season.
The No. 11 Bruins secured a freak victory over a terrible Texas team and barely escaped with wins over unranked Virginia and Memphis. Thursday night, they beat an Arizona State team that was without its starting quarterback and playing with a number of true freshmen on defense, so I’m still not convinced.
Quite a few of UCLA’s touchdowns this season have been pick-sixes, and if you’ve been paying attention, you’ll notice that USC’s redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler hasn’t thrown an interception all season.
Maybe denial is getting the best of me, but I’m going to stick to it for now.
The Trojan squad that steps onto the field this Saturday night will be telling of what to expect for the rest of the season. Should they win, I believe they’ll win the next couple of games, though this team never seems to act according to plan.
I predict the Trojans will bounce back because, as senior tight end Randall Telfer said after practice earlier this week, the team is “hungry to hit someone again.”
Me too, Randall, me too.

UCLA has had freak victories against crappy teams and are overrated? Let’s talk about USC’s loss to unranked BC where the defense couldn’t stop a rush to save their lives. And then when we’re done discussing that, UCLA was already routing #15 ASU when you published this article. They steamrolled a ranked team in a fairly unholy fashion. Who’s overrated, the team that steamrolls #15 and is undefeated or the team that fell apart against an unranked team and is still inexplicably in the top 20?

The 18th-ranked Trojan football team is gearing up for its second Pac-12 showing this Saturday against Oregon State.
The Beavers (3-0) are receiving some national attention for their stellar quarterback, Sean Mannion, but are otherwise a relatively unknown squad.
Hear me roar · Junior defensive end Leonard Williams will play a big role in slowing down Oregon State running back Storm Woods. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Oregon State is trying to establish a new identity following the loss wide receiver Brandin Cooks, who led the nation in receiving yards last year.
Daily Trojan sports editor Aubrey Kragen interviewed Oregon State’s Daily Barometer sports editor TeJo Pack to provide Trojan fans with a better idea of what to expect tomorrow night.
 
DT: How have the Beavers improved since USC beat them last year in Corvallis?
DB: A lot has changed since last year’s game. Sean Mannion’s presence in the pocket and his footwork have greatly improved; this awareness and mobility aids in his ability to find open receivers and make better decisions, while giving him more time.
Also, the team’s defense appears to have found another step. With a core group of returning seniors including [cornerback] Steven Nelson [and linebackers] Michael Doctor and D.J. Alexander, the Beavers look poised to disrupt and pressure the USC offense.
Lastly, the OSU running game has grown into a threat, as opposed to last year’s afterthought. Terron Ward and Storm Woods have developed into a two-back set that plays on each other’s strengths.
 
DT: Oregon State quarterback Sean Mannion is averaging 301.0 yards per game this season. Do you expect him to go over or under in the match-up with USC’s secondary?
DB: With Su’a Cravens patrolling the backfield, USC’s secondary is nothing to ignore, and I’m sure Oregon State’s receivers dedicated some serious film time to this part of the defense.
Though Mannion is missing some of the deep threat ability he had last year, I believe his newfound skills and a more aggressive running game will make for a competitive passing attack, even with the absence of [wide receiver] Victor Bolden. I predict he will float right around the 300 mark again this week.
 
DT: How have the Beavers compensated for the loss of 2013 Biletnikoff Award winner Brandin Cooks?
DB: The loss of an outstanding wide receiver like Cooks is always hard for a team, but it has allowed for the younger receivers to step up and make the big plays. Sophomore Rahmel Dockery showed last week that given the chance, he can make big plays and be a deep threat.
Richard Mullaney and tight end Connor Hamlett both have over 100 yards receiving this season and are averaging more than 10 yards per catch. With these factors, it’s safe to say that Mannion will have plenty of other receivers to throw to, even without Cooks.
 
DT: Who do you think will be Oregon State’s impact player of the game?
DB: On the offensive side of the ball, Dockery has a very real chance of having a break out game and with the absence of Bolden, we should really see what he can do. Likewise, Terron Ward seems to be coming into his own as a ball carrier, so look for him to do great things.
On defense, Steven Nelson will always be a threat in the secondary, but watch out for D.J. Alexander. He came out with a real fire in his belly last week, and this week looks to be no different.
 
DT: Prediction?
DB: This game will be significantly closer than last year’s trouncing. USC will have to contain the running game better than they did against Boston College and keep that Trojan offense rolling.
Mannion and the Beavers will need to spread the ball around and the defense will need the tenacity they presented in their first three match-ups. The Coliseum is also a tough place to play, so controlling the atmosphere will be a key for both teams. In the end, USC will come out on top, but I wouldn’t be surprised by an upset.
Final score: USC 24, Oregon State 14.

The lights of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will shine once again on Saturday night, when the USC football team takes the field against visiting Oregon State. The No. 18 Trojans (2-1, 1-0 Pac-12) fell to Boston College two weeks ago in devastating fashion and hope that a victory can put their season back on track. Standing in the way of that goal are the pass-happy Beavers (3-0, 0-0 Pac-12), who have ridden quarterback Sean Mannion to nonconference wins over Portland State, Hawai’i and San Diego State. Though OSU has yet to face a true test, USC head coach Steve Sarkisian is not overlooking the Trojans’ second Pac-12 opponent.
Get it right, get it tight · Senior tight end Randall Telfer promised that the Trojans won’t overlook the Beavers this weekend. Telfer has seen limited time this year, hauling in just two catches for 35 yards so far. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
 
“They’re a veteran group,” the first-year coach said. “They play really well together … If you hit them with something early in the game, generally it doesn’t work later in the game. They make very good adjustments. The biggest thing they have is great team speed.”
Mannion, ranked by many experts as the top pro-style quarterback prospect in this year’s NFL draft class, is averaging 301.0 yards per game through the air so far this season. With his top target from 2013, wideout Brandin Cooks, now catching passes for the New Orleans Saints, Mannion has opted to spread the wealth in 2014. Though no Oregon State player has reached 200 receiving yards, a whopping eight Beavers have multiple catches.
Tight end Connor Hamlett and wideouts Richard Mullaney and Victor Bolden each have over 100 receiving yards and a touchdown, while running backs Terron Ward and Storm Woods have combined for 166 yards and a score out of the backfield. Sarkisian is wary of the constant danger that Mannion’s skill presents, especially within head coach Mike Riley’s pro-style scheme.
“[Mannion]’s played a lot of football,” Sarkisian said. “He’s a very experienced guy. He’s in a system that is conducive to his skill set. He’s a big, strong, strong-armed guy that is in a system that utilizes those strengths. For whatever reason I think the mesh with Sean [Mannion] and what Coach Riley does is a really good one.”
Aiming to slow down the Beavers’ attack is a USC defensive unit that has shown flashes of brilliance, but has also struggled for large portions of games against Stanford and BC.
Eagles quarterback Tyler Murphy gashed the Trojans for 191 yards on the ground two weeks ago, and while Mannion lacks Murphy’s dual threat capabilities, the Beavers’ have a formidable two-headed monster at running back. Ward and Woods have each picked up 212 yards on the ground on limited carries, with Ward punching in four rushing touchdowns to Woods’ two.
If USC’s last matchup against a pro-style offense, a Sept. 6 win over Stanford, is any indication, the Trojans could be in trouble on Saturday. Though USC’s front seven was effective -— All-American junior defensive end Leonard Williams combined with senior linebacker Hayes Pullard and redshirt junior Anthony Sarao for 29 total tackles, holding the Cardinal to just 3.4 yards per carry — the team’s pass defense was highly suspect. Stanford quarterback Kevin Hogan picked apart the USC secondary, finishing the day 22-of-30 for 285 yards.
Sophomore safety Su’a Cravens, who picked up three tackles for loss against BC, has been a bright spot for the Trojan defense all season. Cravens acknowledges that the Beavers have several options on offense.
“I think they want to stay inside and run the ball,” Cravens said. “But they will take shots when they can.”
On the other side of the ball, the Trojans will face a Beavers’ defense that is much improved from a year ago. OSU boasts a top-20 scoring defense and has held its opponents to an average of just 255 total yards per game.
Linebacker Michael Doctor leads the unit with 18 total tackles, while defensive end Obum Gwacham, a Los Angeles-area native, has added three sacks. Sarkisian praised the work that Oregon State defensive coordinator Mark Banker has done over the past two seasons.
“[Banker]’s a great defensive coach,” Sarkisian said. “They’ve got a veteran secondary, a veteran linebacking corps. They do a great job of flying to the football … putting pressure on the quarterback and being aggressive in the secondary. Our offense is definitely gonna have their work cut out for them.”
With redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler leading the way, the USC offense has been explosive at times so far this season. Kessler has been remarkably efficient, completing 71 percent of his passes for 846 yards, eight touchdowns and no interceptions. Last season, however, USC’s victory over Oregon State was a coming out party for tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen. The then-redshirt sophomore reached the 100-yard mark for the first time, racking up 133 yards and a career-best three touchdowns. Allen would go on to rush for over 100 yards three more times in the season’s final six games, solidifying the starting tailback spot. Kessler was excited about the work his team put in during the bye week.
“We had the bye week and we fixed some things,” Kessler said. “Everyone is flying around, and we’ve had some great practices. We just got to keep doing what [we’re] doing.  Personally I have to take what they give me on defense.”
Senior tight end Randall Telfer, who had his first reception against BC, is also confident about the Trojans’ offensive preparation.
“Oregon State is a team that although a lot of teams might look over, we don’t because they are very physical and disciplined,” Telfer said. “They got a lot of seniors on defense. I’ve been telling the young O-linemen, ‘Just do your job and execute it well. If you got a solid O-line, you got a solid team.’”
USC has dominated the all-time series with the Beavers 60-11, with four ties. Still, Trojan fans only have to go back to 2010 for an ugly memory at Oregon State, when the unranked Beavers destroyed No. 20 USC 36-7.
Two years earlier, the No. 1 Trojans were stunned 27-21 by another unranked Oregon State squad on the same field. History is still on USC’s side, however, as the Beavers have not won a game at the Coliseum since 1960.
Saturday’s matchup kicks off at 7:30 p.m. and will be broadcast on ESPN.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Wednesday, Sept. 24, and Thursday, Sept. 25. 
Crimes against property
At 8:13 a.m. on Sept. 24, a student reported being approached by a suspect from behind when she was walking near 29th Street and Orchard Avenue. The suspect attempted to take the student’s cellular phone out of her hands. The student turned around and then the suspect demanded that the student give the suspect her cell phone. The student then started to scream and ran into the middle of the street while the suspect ran from the scene. The student called DPS, who searched but found no suspect.
At 11:16 A.m. on Sept. 24, a staff member reported to DPS that her USC Parking Permit was missing.
At 1:35 P.m. on Sept. 24, DPS officers responded to a report that a student at Ronald Tutor Campus Center attempted to buy a meal with a counterfeit $20 bill. The student told DPS that he did not know that the bill was counterfeit and he was allowed to pay with an authentic $20 bill. The counterfeit bill was confiscated from the student and DPS turned it in to Bank of America.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 8:55 a.m. on Sept. 24, DPS responded to a report that a student at the Lorenzo Apartments was suicidal. Upon arrival, the student was unharmed and declined an offer to get in contact with a counselor at Student Counseling Center. DPS left the scene after concluding that the student did not pose a threat to herself.
at 10:33 A.m. on Sept. 24, it was reported that a staff member in the parking structure on Exposition Boulevard drove a USC vehicle into a concrete island, damaging the tire on the front side of the vehicle.
at 10:40 a.m. on Sept. 24, a non-USC female was suffering from diabetic shock. DPS officers and a Rapid Response Team responded to evaluate the female and transport her to Keck Hospital to receive medical treatment.
at 11:21 a.m. on Sept. 24, a non-USC male was suffering from low blood pressure. DPS officers and a Rapid Response Team responded and evaluated the male and transported him to Keck Hospital to receive medical treatment.
at 3:13 P.m. on Sept. 24,  a student reported that his cell phone screen was broken after a suspect slapped it out of his hand during a confrontation about a flag that was stolen from a booth at Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street. DPS officers arrived and conducted a search but were unable to find the suspect.

In recent weeks, several students have been victims of an apparent scam to solicit money in exchange for fake magazine subscriptions. According to the Dept. of Public Safety, six students have reported being approached by these solicitors since mid-September.
The solicitors have been going door-to-door at various off-campus apartment complexes, including Troy Hall, Cardinal Gardens and Regal Trojan. They claim to be making extra money by selling magazine subscriptions and are asking for additional donations that they claim will go toward charitable causes such as autism and cancer research.
DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said he’s fairly confident that students won’t be receiving magazines any time soon and that the donations will not be given to charity.
“[The solicitors] are saying subscriptions can only be purchased in cash and on more than one occasion these solicitors have talked the student into going to the ATM and withdrawing cash,” Carlisle said. “Because the ruse involves ‘charity’ more than one student has given several hundred dollars, which is in excess of most magazine subscriptions.”
The receipts given to students are yellow and pink and read “D.C. Sales,” but Carlisle said DPS is suspicious because the receipts don’t list the specific items purchased.
Carlisle said the scam artists appear to be working in a group and that they sometimes pose as USC students.
DPS and Los Angeles Police Department detectives are working together to build a case, but Carlisle said cases like these can often take a long time to verify because magazine subscriptions take time to go into effect.
“A person who gave one of these solicitors $500 only a few days ago may not realize that the magazines probably aren’t going to be coming,” Carlisle said. “While we strongly suspect that it’s a theft by trick or device, or a scam or ruse, it takes a while for investigators to determine that in fact the company is fictitious and to establish that it was a completely false claim.”
Even if students do receive the magazines, they might not receive the quantity that they paid for. The case then becomes a civil matter rather than a criminal one.
DPS has reached out to other colleges, including UCLA, L.A. Trade Tech and Cal State L.A., to see if they have any reports of a similar scam. Carlisle said scams like these are fairly common on college campuses and that he would not be surprised if some encounters with the group have gone unreported.
“Students should be wary, and unless they’re absolutely certain it’s legitimate — and many aren’t — they should decline,” Carlisle said.  “Never give cash, never give a credit card number. If the person insists, students can always volunteer to meet them at [DPS headquarters] and do the transaction here. We’d love to meet them.”

A new study released by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism on Monday found that women are significantly underrepresented in film and television worldwide.
The findings of the “Gender Bias Without Borders” study were presented by the Media, Diversity, & Social Change initiative at Annenberg and garnered global attention upon release.
Annenberg professor Stacy L. Smith, the director of the initiative, led a team of student researchers along with project administrator Marc Choueiti and researcher Katherine Pieper. They reviewed 120 films in the 10 most profitable film territories globally.
“We have been studying top-grossing U.S. films for several years. However, the entertainment industry is expanding internationally,” Smith, who presented the study publicly earlier this week, said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We were interested in how females were portrayed in popular content produced outside the United States. If activists and advocates are aware of international trends, they can be more effective in creating change.”
USC students from various places around the world coming from a variety of majors participated in the study. According to Choueiti, participants included people from Brazil, China, India, Japan, Germany, France, Russia and South Korea. The team watched each film in the study multiple times to ensure accuracy and analyzed a number of different variables.
The data collected showed that women are missing from film. Within the sample set there were 2.24 male characters for every female character. Only 23.3 percent of films had a girl or woman as a lead or co-lead. Action-adventure movies had the fewest females — out of a total of 5,799 speaking or named characters, 30.9 percent were female. The study also looked at facets of physical appearance, including sexually revealing clothing, nudity, thinness and attractiveness. It found that female characters had higher percentages than men in every category, and a female is just as likely to be sexualized in a film if they are 13 or 39.
Gender imbalance varied by country. The study showed that the United States had one of the lowest percentages of female characters in film, while the United Kingdom had one of the highest. The sample of films that were collaborations between the United States and United Kingdom, however, had the lowest percentage of the 11 countries studied.
“In some ways, the findings are consistent with what we see in U.S. films. However, there are several countries that performed a bit better on indicators like gender prevalence in stories,” Pieper wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan.
The gender gap continues off screen as well. Out of 1,452 filmmakers, only 20.5 percent were women. Females comprised 7 percent of directors. Trends in both the percentages of women on and off screen might be related.
“Having a female director or writer is related to more female characters on screen in film,” Choueiti wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Though the study is now published, the team isn’t done yet.
“We would also like to examine other countries, such as territories in the Middle East, that were not studied in this first global investigation,” wrote Smith in an email.
Students said that the gender imbalance in the film industry is a concern.
“There is a certain male dominance in this industry, and even though there are organizations trying to change the situation like Women of Cinematic Arts at USC, the difference is still obvious,” said Ipek Kahraman, a freshman majoring in film production.
 
Really? This what is news to you guys? Action Films? You do understand that a 120lb women in real life, no matter how much we think the genders are the same doesn’t actually beat the crap out of 220lb men right? Buffy the Vampire Slayer was a fantasy character, that stuff does not happen in the real world. I am not going to watch a movie with a bunch of women who are supposed to be Navy SEALs, Army SF, Army Rangers, etc…because they are not real. Even if that does happen eventually, they will have dropped the standards so much that they will still be a joke and a radical feminist fantasy of gender equal outcomes versus equal opportunities. I truly cannot believe people pay to go these schools if this is what time is spent on. No wonder our non-STEM degrees are such a joke.

Heavy pedestrian traffic near the new Village construction site on Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street could cause accidents, according to the Dept. of Public Safety.
Watch out · The South Traffic Bureau division of the LAPD can cite students for walking in prohibited areas. Fines and citations for these infractions can amount to over $200, according to DPS. – Graphic courtesy of DPS Crime Prevention
Construction barriers have eliminated the sidewalk on the west side of Hoover Street and much of McClintock Avenue. DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said the department is concerned that pedestrians walking in the street on such a busy road have an increased chance of injury.
“We are worried that students could be struck,” Carlisle said. “During some peak hours, students will start walking along that sidewalk and then keep going in the street.”
DPS Chief John Thomas said the sidewalk could remain closed for the three-year duration of the Village construction project. DPS is hoping to educate students early on so that they understand this is not the intersection that they were familiar with before, and they should adjust their travel habits accordingly. He added that DPS is hoping to reopen the sidewalk before the completion of construction.
“The biggest concern is any time you have pedestrians walking in the same roadway as cars traveling and particularly if the students’ backs are to the cars, it’s never good,” Thomas said. “You’re only talking about a two-lane highway — two lanes going south on that side — and if you’ve got pedestrians in one lane that means you’ve just reduced that to a one-lane highway. As vehicles are coming around the corner potentially there are blind spots, and they could potentially hit a student.”
In August, DPS sent out an email to students that included a map of the construction site. The email warned that it was unsafe for pedestrians to walk along these areas where there is no sidewalk access.
People who walk in the street are in violation of California Vehicle Code 21956a and could be fined up to $196. It is legal for bicyclists to use the street, but not for skateboarders because a person on a skateboard is considered a pedestrian under the law.
“Should LAPD South Traffic Bureau be in the area on patrol or if they respond to complaints, they could cite you,” Carlisle said. “They don’t cite into student judicial affairs, they cite into court, which fines people and with court costs associated with the fine. Typically it’s over $200.”
One of DPS’s largest concerns is a pedestrian getting injured on game day when there are large crowds.
“We’re hoping through education to let students know to not walk in the street where it’s hazardous,” Carlisle said. “Our goal is to prevent a collision from occurring and injuring a student. We are going to see how that works this Saturday, which is a game day, and try to monitor that.”
According to Carlisle, Capital Construction, which is employed by USC, is considering putting some of the money in the project budget toward buying a portable message board to warn people not to walk in the street and to use the other side.
Areas on and near campus have been closed before due to construction, and Carlisle said DPS previously posted officers along McClintock during the remodeling of the Uytengsu Aquatic Center. He added that it is more difficult to control pedestrian traffic on public streets near The Village’s construction.
Carlisle said that the City of Los Angeles and the university worked to remove the diagonal crosswalks at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street because they wanted to discourage people from crossing over to the north corner.
Thomas said there have yet to be any collisions reported near the construction site, and DPS is hoping to keep it that way by keeping students on the sidewalks.
“Our biggest concern is the safety of the students. Any time you’ve got pedestrians and bikes and skateboards in the same roadway, it’s just a recipe for disaster,” he said.

When Angelenos think of date night, a cozy, softly lit restaurant in a trendy neighborhood serving easily shared small plates might come to mind. Naturally, the staff must be sporting the hippest new haircuts and sleeves of colorful tattoos for diners to get the full experience. In a city with as restless a population as Los Angeles, date night spots have to be hip and stylish in every way — without leaving quality at the door.
Alimento, an Italian restaurant that opened in Silver Lake this summer, seeks to give diners that perfect L.A. date night experience so artfully achieved by the likes of beloved Hollywood hangouts Canele and BOSC. It’s easy to understand why young chef Zach Pollack chose regional Italian cuisine for his first restaurant -— safe and universally loved, housemade pasta and a killer wine list don’t usually disappoint. Unfortunately, the wine list is the only thing killer about Alimento; Pollack might have created the quintessential ambience, but the food is not the least bit better than average.
Alimento’s decor is a little bit modern, a little bit rustic and all-around warm and welcoming. With soft overhead lighting and candles on each table, the 48-seat restaurant seems to be the perfect place for a couple to set down their cell phones and laugh out loud at each other’s jokes over a steaming plate of pasta.
True to modern form, the denim-clad, iPad-wielding host is the first face customers see once they drop their cars off at the valet ($5). Patrons are seated immediately, given menus and offered their choice of sparkling or still water before they can even get a good look at the little room or the outfits of their trendy fellow diners.
A first glance of the menu, printed on cardstock with charming yellow accents, gives diners hope that the fresh, locally sourced fare will be just as pleasing as the aesthetics have been so far. Divided into plates, pasta and platters — larger meat and fish dishes — Pollack mixes in old favorites such as chopped salad ($14) and pigs in a blanket ($11) with innovative new dishes like the escolar crudo, a cold fish salad ($10).
Since the majority of the menu is written in Italian, the staff members at Alimento are a great resource. Aside from handy translations, they also eagerly give recommendations on their favorite dishes on the menu along with some direction toward wine pairings. Unfortunately for Alimento, the service is the only truly remarkable part of dinner.
Both staff favorites, the escolar crudo and chopped salad, do not impress as appetizers. The escolar is just a little too tough, and the eggplant a little too tangy in the crude for the dish to live up to its recommendation. Similarly, the chopped salad’s dressing is too creamy and the sprinkling of salami too sparse for it to satisfy, let alone impress.
If you don’t want to commit to a platter — which according to the staff is a truly unmanageable portion of food for two people — the only option for main courses are pastas.
The whole-wheat bigoli ($13) is a thick, homemade spaghetti-like pasta in a creamy tomato sauce. The locally grown ingredients are the only things differentiating this boring dish from the pasta in tomato sauce that could be thrown together on a Tuesday night by any college student who knows how to boil water. The gnóc ($16) was another all-around doughy disappointment. Both these pastas have the potential to wow upon introduction but unfortunately miss the mark.
To Alimento’s credit, the short but sweet dessert menu is packed with light and delectable treats that at least finish dinner off on a happy note. The almond cake ($7) is the perfect choice for those not wanting to commit to chocolate but looking for something more substantial than fruit. Placed in a bed of creme fraiche and mascarpone cherries, the cake is fluffy and ties together perfectly for a not-too-sweet yet perfectly satisfying end to a rather disappointing dinner.
Hopefully it’s just growing pains for newbie Pollack and this date night spot, and there’s nothing wrong with just enjoying the ambience.
Alimento is open Tuesday through Thursday and Sunday for dinner until 10 p.m. and Friday and Saturday until 12 a.m. The menu is moderately priced; a full three course dinner for two with two glasses of wine came out to be $76. It’s rumored that Alimento will be opening brunch service in the next few months. Here’s to hoping it’s more inspiring than the dinner fare that just didn’t make the cut.

Time might be a flat circle, but the speculation over the casting of the second season of True Detective is finally drawing to a close.
Mystery solved · Colin Farrell, seen above as a police officer in the 2008 film Pride and Glory, and Vince Vaughn have been announced as two of the four leads in the second season of HBO’s True Detective. – Photo Courtesy of New Line Cinema
Last Tuesday, HBO confirmed that Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn would be joining the critically adored series for its highly anticipated sophomore outing, which will swap the swampy desolation of rural Louisiana for the sun-baked coastal highways of Southern California. According to showrunner Nic Pizzolatto, who has written and will continue to write the script for every episode, the next season focuses on a new string of occult-tinged murders and a trio of brilliant but psychologically troubled investigators, one of them female, who are called upon to hunt down the Golden State’s latest man-shaped monster.
To say Farrell, Vaughn and their as-of-yet unannounced co-stars have a tough act to follow would be an understatement. True Detective’s first season, which premiered to widespread critical and popular acclaim last January, was a cult phenomenon driven by the twin engines of Matthew McConaughey as shamanic nihilist Rust Cohle and Woody Harrelson as his increasingly unhinged macho partner Marty Hart, who spend 17 years agonizing over a series of ritualistic homicides in the deepest, darkest regions of bayou country.
It takes luminous talent to wear darkness well, and the first season was a near-flawless convergence of powerhouse acting, mesmeric storytelling, dread-soaked atmosphere and technical bravura, the latter courtesy of director Cary Fukunaga and his fondness for long, seamless tracking shots, with a rattle-them-bones soundtrack supervised by T-Bone Burnett thrown in for good measure. Fan interest only grew more rabid when later episodes revealed a wriggling undercurrent of Lovecraftian-style cosmic horror lurking beneath the show’s procedural surface, one containing direct allusions to Robert W. Chambers’ 1885 weird short story collection The King in Yellow, which revolves around a play whose second act imparts such dark and terrible truths about the universe that it induces instant and incurable madness in anyone who reads it or sees it performed.
The news of Vaughn and Farrell’s casting also triggered its share of madness, the kind that clogs message boards and YouTube comments sections with hyperbolic tirades and knee-jerk provocations. The online consensus holds that no one can possibly top McConaughey and Harrelson, who are only returning in their capacity as executive producers, but the brunt of the fans’ skepticism seems reserved for Vaughn, who’s been languishing in lame paycheck comedies such as The Internship and Delivery Man for so long that everyone appears to have forgotten what a charming and naturalistic performer he can be when given the right material.
Want proof of Vaughn’s talents beyond Swingers, Dodgeball and Wedding Crashers? Look no further than his early, non-comedic work in Tarsem Singh’s psychotronic horror odyssey The Cell, or his demented turn as an aw-shucks serial killer in the 1998 Tarantino knockoff Clay Pigeons. If he can bring that same loose, freewheeling energy to Frank Semyon, the career criminal who’s forced to aid in the trio’s investigation after his business partner is murdered, the second season of True Detective could be a fresh start for the actor. After all, it wasn’t so long ago that McConaughey’s career was in similar trouble. Maybe this could be Vaughn’s Lincoln Lawyer moment.
The fans also seem leery of Farrell, which is understandable given the Irish actor’s recent rash of high-profile flops – the nonsensical Winter’s Tale and the slick but wholly unnecessary Total Recall remake are particularly egregious examples – but he’s proven himself a thoughtful and nuanced presence in roles that don’t require him to carry a film by himself.
Farrell’s True Detective role, a morally conflicted, mob-owned cop named Ray Velcoro, seems like a conscious echo of his best performance to date as the childish, guilt-ridden hit man Ray in Martin McDonagh’s masterful dark comedy In Bruges, which works primarily because of how well it complements Brendan Gleeson’s character, Ray’s remarkably well-adjusted mentor and father figure Ken. The nefarious pair’s musings on the subjects of death and atonement as they tour the churches and canals of Bruges are every bit as compelling as McConaughey and Harrelson’s existential chitchat, albeit in a very different tonal context. Farrell is also capable of filling out an ensemble cast with aplomb, as demonstrated in under-seen gems such as London Boulevard, Seven Psychopaths and his wonderful turn as country singer Tommy Sweet in Crazy Heart, where he showcased his musical chops as the flourishing former protégé of Jeff Bridges’ alcoholic troubadour.
Taylor Kitsch, another actor with some highly publicized bombs under his belt after the one-two punch of John Carter and Battleship back in 2012, is rumored to be circling the role of a second male detective, presumably Velcoro’s partner. The former Friday Night Lights star is still considered box office poison, but he’s coming off some terrific notices for playing a closeted Wall Street investor turned gay rights activist in HBO’s original movie The Normal Heart, so hopefully True Detective can accelerate his comeback.
Even if the other performers end up being ideal fits for their characters, the success of True Detective’s sophomore season will likely hinge on the actress who scores the third and final detective role, a hard-drinking gambling addict by the name of Ani Bezzarides. One of the few criticisms lobbed at the first season was its disinterest in showing a female point of view. Michelle Monaghan, who played Harrelson’s put upon wife Maggie, was believably sympathetic as a woman who can feel her husband’s inner demons slowly taking hold, but she was too often either relegated to the sidelines or used as a means of manufacturing drama between the two male leads. Rosario Dawson, Jessica Biel, Malin Akerman, Abigail Spencer, Oona Chaplin, Jaimie Alexander and Brit Marling have all reportedly auditioned for the role of Ani since last Thursday, and Rachel McAdams and Keira Knightley continue to be floated as possibilities, but Pizzolatto’s decision is still forthcoming.
So this is where we end it: solving one mystery and finding another, an eternal return to a vast, godless wasteland of rumors that dream of being facts. Rust Cohle, eat your Ligotti-loving heart out.

A trite premise, predictable story and two awkward protagonists all make for a surprisingly entertaining time in Max Nichols’ new romantic comedy Two Night Stand. The indie rom-com is carried by Miles Teller and Analeigh Tipton’s offbeat interactions and believable chemistry that makes the film an enjoyable romp through modern dating’s pitfalls.
Stick with it · Once the film wades through a bog of cliches to arrive at its main setpiece of the two leads trapped in an apartment together, it is set free to explore some entertaining territory in the second act. – Photo Courtesy of eOnePublicity
The film starts too predictably — a sad, broken girl, inordinately torn up over an average breakup and an average boy. Feminists beware: This is not a film for the faint of heart, as Megan (Tipton) lopes around her girlfriend’s apartment post-breakup, apparently without a job, lacking the motivation to fix the mess that is her life. Misguided by the ever-stereotypical best friend (played in Valley girl voice by Jessica Szohr) who thinks it’s time Megan moved on with a one-night stand, Tipton’s character signs up for what appears to be Tinder for slightly older folks.
Within minutes, after a few gulps of wine and some uncomfortably realistic creepy messages, Megan is treated to witty banter with normal-looking, happy Alec, played by a charming Teller. Moviegoers will smile at the naive niceness on both sides of the exchange, and are expected to suspend disbelief as Megan rushes across New York City on a snowy night to have sex with a stranger. Unfortunately for the pair, the fun doesn’t really start until the next morning, as Megan’s attempt to sneak out is foiled by a snowstorm (surprise!).
This is where the movie really gets interesting because it’s not tied down by the dumb, supportive best friend, conventions about dating or the unimaginative premise. With the rest of the film taking place almost entirely in Alec’s apartment, viewers join the pair in awkward, uncomfortable and truly laughable situations, finally bringing the audience into a world they can imagine, one where sex isn’t the be-all and end-all.
Forced to deal with each other, Alec and Megan decide to correct each other’s sexual techniques for fun and “science,” and though their sex tips could be drafted from a Cosmo article, the banter is believable and the indignation on either side relatable and hilarious. The casting is commendable — it helps that neither of the stars is chiseled, Photoshop-perfect or suave in manner. Viewers might see a little bit of themselves in Tipton’s awkward attempts to learn to sexily undress and Teller’s college boy solution to their problems.
Those who are willing to hang up their rom-com skepticism for the night will be swept into the adorable romance that forms between the pair as they go through all the motions of dating in the space of a day, and learn to be better friends and lovers.
Pause for a sharp right turn into “dramedy” territory — the film veers off course near the end, trying and failing to introduce conflict to break up the hunky-dory happiness of new love but again finds its way with the predictability of romantic comedies.
The film also touches on the darker concepts of feminism and sl-t-shaming in an unconscious way, with Alec asking Megan if the one-night stand is what she “usually does,” though his behavior is never called into question. Megan also admits that her plan in life was to be a wife and mother, never planning on using her degree, making every career-oriented woman in the audience cringe at the assumption.
But it seems the intent is never to harm or criticize, and the film is pure entertainment in its simplest form. Tipton is more likable than she has ever been and has come a long way from the creepy teenager in Crazy, Stupid, Love, while Teller is a fantastic leading man, caring without seeming disingenuous, silly without being ridiculous. Original music by brothers Neil and Matthew de Luca is current and bright without being bubblegum, enhancing the sensory experience in an otherwise plain-Jane production.
Not for the romantic skeptic or the intellectual moviegoer, Two Night Stand will find fans in those looking for an easy laugh and feel-good warmth.

National Voter Registration Day took place this past Tuesday, six weeks before Election Day on Nov. 4. In other words, folks around the nation celebrated the equivalent of a college professor having a “don’t forget to turn in your paper in six weeks” day.
The national day was established in 2012 by the League of Women Voters and, since then, has registered more than 350,000 people to participate in America’s elections. As far as party lines go, it is a day strongly favored by Democrats, who have consistently shown stronger support than Republicans. The GOP has instead tended to engage in an effort to make it more difficult to register to vote through restrictive requirements.
As usual, both parties have entirely missed the point in their respective strategies. In the Democrats’ effort to register voters and the Republicans’ effort to prevent that process, both parties have overlooked a glaring problem: Registering voters might increase the number of people who vote, but it does not increase the number of people who care.
In the long run, this nation needs more people who care.
Two things determine whether or not someone will vote: convenience and motivation. Motivating excited voters is a better strategy across the board because out of the two factors, it is more important. Consider this hypothetical percentage-based breakdown: Motivation, which boils down to a basic question of caring about politics, makes up 80 percent of someone’s decision to vote while convenience, which encompasses registration, access to polling places and the like, makes up only about 20 percent.
Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign is a prime example. The overwhelming majority of the campaign’s success in increasing voter turnout (and going on to win the election) was not due to registering so many people to vote, but rather because they had a remarkably motivated base of Democratic voters.
Census data released after the 2008 election showed that 48.5 percent of those aged 18-24 voted in the election. In 2012, census data showed that only 41.2 percent of citizens between those ages voted (but used a range of 18-25) in the election.
The decline in voter turnout is certainly not because 9 percent of young voters suddenly became “unregistered” to vote between 2008 and 2012. They remained registered — but their motivation dwindled.
People who vote because they feel motivated to are much more invested in the State of our Union than people who vote for the sake of convenience. For one, those people are more likely to stay engaged with their government and start conversations that will make elected officials’ decision more meaningful. Second, those people are more likely to make a more informed vote — imagine a world in which a huge number of people are registered to vote on National Voter Registration Day, but have no idea who the candidates are or what issues they represent. Are those really the people we want to register to vote in this country?
Inspiring people to care about politics is a catch-all solution because an inspired citizen who isn’t registered to vote is more likely to register, and an inspired registered voter is more likely to vote. On the other hand, a voter who is already registered gains nothing from the massive efforts put forth by National Voter Registration Day because it is too far away from Election Day.
Here’s a solution. The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that same-day registration is only offered by 10 states and the District of Columbia. To vote in an election as a citizen of any other state, one has to register prior to a deadline, with most falling between eight and 30 days before the election. Implementing same-day registration will both register more voters and inspire voters to vote because motivational messages can be incorporated.
Republican-backed laws that require voters to obtain government identification have been shown to disproportionately hurt minorities, who are less likely to be able to obtain an ID. They are implemented under the guise of preventing voter fraud, which is also shown to be of negligible importance. But the line should be drawn at over-focusing on voter registration at the expense of motivation — because winning the hearts and minds of citizens is more important than just collecting their signatures on a registration form.

Earlier this month, the school board in Durham, North Carolina voted to end its relationship with Teach for America in 2016, once the most recent teachers from the program complete their two-year contracts. In April of this year, Pittsburgh became the first district to terminate an active contract with TFA. Though the reasons both systems cited for parting ways with the teaching corps are nothing new to the discourse surrounding education reform, they are nevertheless valid and important exercises in dissent.
Vik Cuthbertson | Daily Trojan
 
TFA is a teaching corps that recruits college students from institutions throughout the country and places them in positions with underserved school districts after they graduate. More than 5,000 recent graduates began their two-year commitment this fall, becoming part of the nearly 11,000 that make up the program across 35 states and D.C. The program is highly competitive and recruits come from every Ivy League school as well as  many large state universities. More than 465 USC alumni have taught as corps members in the TFA’s 24-year history. With 70 students joining last year’s corps, USC was ranked the second-largest contributor to TFA. Forty-two USC graduates joined the 2014 corps.
Corps members don’t have to study education prior to applying to the corps. In fact, most corps members have not. The summer prior to their first year, all recruits are required to attend a rigorous five-week training session to acquire basic teaching certifications.
This training method is one of the qualms that critics of TFA, including the Durham school district, often cite. They argue that experienced and highly trained teachers would provide more benefit to underserved districts and that five weeks cannot possibly prepare anyone to jump into the teaching profession, especially not in circumstances under which TFA teachers are often placed.
Another reason the Durham school board cited for breaking ties with TFA is the two-year turnover, which can be detrimental to already underserved districts that have a difficult time retaining instructors to begin with. The poor turnover also hurts students who need stability.
When Pittsburgh decided to terminate an active TFA contract this past December, another reason brought up seemed to be the close relationship TFA has with a large number of charter schools and the privatization movement in education reform. In Los Angeles County, for example, 90 percent of TFA participants are placed in charter schools. As one Al Jazeera article put it, this results in “pulling resources out of neighborhood schools and abandoning the kids most in need of quality public instruction.”
Furthermore, the flow of profit from charter schools can be easily traced from public officials to corporate supporters. Two firms in Ohio known to regularly contribute to elected officials run 9 percent of the state’s charter schools but received 38 percent of the state’s increase in charter funding last year. The number of charter schools in the United States has more than doubled in the past decade, despite the fact that a recent Stanford University study showed that charter students might not actually test better than public school students, and in some cases even do worse.
TFA’s contribution to this movement is a detriment to the advancement of public schools and, more importantly, public school teachers. Not to mention, school districts are often bound by contract to continue hiring a certain number of TFA teachers, while career teachers and union members face the harsh reality of budget cuts, layoffs and furloughs.
Overall, the deficiencies cited by the Durham school district are structural issues that can be changed with pressure from outside forces — issues with training and contract timing could be resolved with comprehensive changes. The actions of both school districts that have decided to drop TFA contracts are examples of such pressure that demonstrate the important role of democratic school boards. This expression of dissent is not only healthy, but vital to the progress and improvement of education reform.
Ultimately, anything that gets young people as enthusiastic about being involved in the education of younger generations as TFA does has potential that should be tapped. TFA has created a space for progress, but it’s up to future reformers and critics to create new ideas to put into this space. In other words, either amend TFA to mean less corporate charter ties and more empowerment for public school systems, or create a new system altogether.
 
As one Al Jazeera article put it, this results in “pulling resources out of neighborhood schools and abandoning the kids most in need of quality public instruction.” 
This is just an outright lie. Rhetoric in place of actual reporting, shame on you. Charter schools who serve primarily low-income communities of color in LA far outperform their “neighborhood” district-run counterparts and they do it with fewer resources.
Teach for Awhile.  How about just becoming a real teacher?

Over the past few weeks, a slew of celebrities have found themselves in the spotlight, but for all of the wrong reasons. According to CNN, an unknown hacker obtained nude photos of one male and over 100 female public figures via iCloud, and subsequently released them onto the Internet. The biggest names among them included “Hunger Games” actress Jennifer Lawrence, model Kate Upton and reality star Kim Kardashian, while others, such as Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney and pop singer Ariana Grande were also targeted. This was clearly a gross violation of privacy, but even grosser was the fact that the American public was so quick to laugh at, distribute and ridicule the photos and respective celebrities.
It’s no secret that the media has long sensationalized celebrity news. With the rising popularity of pseudo-journalistic tabloids and associated websites, both rumors and official happenings are circulated at record speeds. But while this has stimulated the entertainment industry, it has also generated a nasty side effect. Society no longer takes these public figures seriously due to the “stories” that are written about these individuals, and as such, they are mere sources of entertainment.
Ironically, celebrities rose to fame due to their essential roles in the entertainment industry. As film and television actors, singers, models and personalities, their careers hinged on looks and perceptions. However, the line between public and private information is nonexistent: the freedom of the press allows tabloids to publish freely, regardless of whether or not it is information about a celebrity’s private life, such as with the nude photo leak.
The release of the photos triggered a variety of responses. Although some readers were sympathetic, many condemned the celebrities themselves for taking the photos. In the comment section of a Washington Post article about the photo leak, one user wrote, “The best way to maintain personal privacy of your body, is NOT to take your naked photos to begin with.” While this may be true, photos are a form of personal property, just like clothes or shoes. The exposure and distribution of these pictures is theft. These public figures did not take these pictures with the intention of them being released to the public, just as one does not buy items with the intention of them getting stolen. It may seem like a strange comparison, but at its very basis, this scandal was nothing more than a robbery, albeit one that was blown out of proportion by the media.
There are lots of variables that cannot be controlled in situations like these. Celebrities will continue to take racy photographs, and hackers will continue to attempt to collect information and photos that will stir up controversy. The tabloids will always print provocative stories that they believe will sell magazines. The single factor that can be altered is society’s treatment of celebrity culture. The more people feed into media sensationalism by circulating nude photos or posting ridiculing comments online, the greater the situation will appear. It is disrespectful to shame or poke fun at those whose pictures have been unlawfully stolen and subsequently released; the entertainment that we take for granted should come from celebrities’ official work, not events that take place in their personal lives. The media will continue to shape the way the public views celebrity culture, but as it stands now, it is completely out of control. Public figures are people, too, and they deserve respect.

Following Wednesday night’s lopsided 9-1 victory against the Giants, the Dodgers have officially their second consecutive National League West title. 
Dodgers’ ace Clayton Kershaw took the mound and held the Giants to eight hits and one early run in eight innings pitched. Kershaw gave up no walks and stroke out eleven Giants’ batters on the night. He was even on his game at the plate, as he tied the game at one apiece in the fifth inning with a triple. What can’t he do?

Kershaw finished the regular season on par with all of the MVP and Cy Young chatter surrounding him. His record stands at 21-3, an MLB best. His earned-run average is 1.77 and he leads the National League with 239 strikeouts.
 It is likely that Kershaw will not pitch again until the Dodgers’ first playoff game on Friday, October 3rd, a game that is expected to be a rematch of last year’s division series against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Wednesday’s game was the finale of a three-game series against their rival Giants, in which the Dodgers took two games out of three. They have since recovered after dropping the series opener Monday, 2-5, in 13 innings. 
The Dodgers’ other ace, Zack Greinke, led his team to a 4-2 win on Tuesday night to tie the series at 1-1 and set the stage for Kershaw to solidify a division win. Greinke threw a season-high eight innings, allowing six hits and two runs, while striking out five. With 200 strikeouts this season, Greinke joins Kershaw as only the second Dodger duo since 1970 to have over 200 strikeouts in a season. 
Tensions between the division rivals came to a head in the first inning of Tuesday’s game when Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner hit outfielder Yasiel Puig in the foot with an 88 mph wild pitch. The benches cleared after the two exchanged a few words and Puig took off towards the mound, though no physical blows were actually exchanged. 
The Dodgers have now guaranteed themselves a spot in the post season, regardless of the outcome of their final regular season series against the Rockies, and the Giants are still five games ahead of Milwaukee for the second Wild Card spot in the National League.
It seems that the Dodgers have San Francisco’s number, as the three-game series earlier this month followed the same result as this one. 
Unfortunately for the Dodgers, it seems that another team has their number– likely their first postseason opponent, the St. Louis Cardinals. In order for the Dodgers to get past the Cards, Clayton Kershaw needs to make sure that his postseason numbers match his regular season ones, something he struggled with and was criticized for last October. 
Greinke also needs to continue his role as the team’s second ace, while Dan Haren and Hyun Jin Ryu continue to give the rotation depth. 
As for the bats, well, Matt Kemp, Yasiel Puig and Hanley Ramirez need to keep their bats alive, as the team has often struggled on offense against the St. Louis pitching staff.
