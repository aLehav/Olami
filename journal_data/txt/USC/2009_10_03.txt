It was supposed to be USC’s toughest game of the year. Instead, the Trojans made it look easy.
The No. 7 Trojans breezed past No. 24 Cal 30-3 Saturday at Memorial Stadium in a game in which the Trojans dominated every aspect and put together their best all-around performance of the season in front of 71,799.

After a rocky three-week stretch that saw the Trojans squeak past Ohio State, get upset by Washington, then underperform against Washington State, everything seemed to come together for USC on offense, defense and special teams.
“I am really fired up about a lot of good things that are happening,” USC coach Pete Carroll said. “This is a win we take a lot of pride in. We are just going to keep on pushing.”
Cal looked like it would put up a fight when it marched down the field with ease on its first possession to the Trojans’ 6-yard line. But all the Golden Bears’ momentum vanished when quarterback Kevin Riley rolled out to the right side and threw an ill-advised pass that was intercepted by senior safety Taylor Mays in the end zone.
“We looked a little shaky [on the first drive] but the defense has always come through,” redshirt sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo said. “And we’ve been awesome with our backs against the wall this year.”
“They were driving and they were making a statement early in the game that they were ready to play,” Mays said.
Mays’ pick silenced Cal’s early statement and the USC offense took over from there. The Trojans moved the ball 80 yards in six plays, culminating in a highlight-reel 38-yard touchdown run by running back Joe McKnight in which the junior dove past two defenders and stretched out just enough to get the ball over the plain.
“It was a big tone-setter for everybody on the offense and plus for the whole team,” McKnight said.
Carroll said the immediate response by the USC offense carried even more weight than Mays’ interception.
“Even better than [the interception] was the drive after that, 80 yards down for the touchdown,” Carroll said.
After McKnight’s touchdown, the Trojans scored 13 more unanswered points to finish what was perhaps their best half of football this season. McKnight scored again in the fourth quarter to lead the Trojans with 121 yards on 20 carries.
USC’s first-half dominance was highlighted by redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams’ 66-yard punt return for a touchdown. Williams found a seam up the middle then tiptoed along the sideline before diving toward the pile-on for the score.
The junior, who took over fulltime punt returning duties this season, was pleased after his first career punt return for a touchdown.
“I caught the ball and all 10 guys in front of me made great blocks,” Williams said. “It started with Garrett Green. He made pretty much the springing block in front of me and I only had to beat one person, and that was the punter.”
Although he did not throw a touchdown, freshman quarterback Matt Barkley had his most consistent performance of his career, going 20-of-35 for 283 yards with one interception. The offensive playbook seemed to fully open up for the first time this season, allowing Barkley to take shots down the field.
“I think they’ve had that faith [in me] this whole time, we just decided to it open up now,” Barkley said. “I’m confident that the coaches believe in me and they do.”
While the Trojans were racking up points, Cal’s offense failed to get going after Riley’s interception. The USC defense limited Cal running back Jahvid Best to 49 yards on 14 carries.
“We felt like we had control at some points in the game, but it just wasn’t happening for us,” Best said.
With the Heisman-hopeful unable to get into a rhythm, Cal became one-dimensional, and the onus was on Riley to beat the Trojans throwing. But the pass defense held as well, holding Riley to 14-of-40 passing with 199 yards and one interception.
“We were zero-dimensional today, because we couldn’t run it and we couldn’t throw it,” Cal coach Jeff Tedford said.
Cal avoided the shutout when kicker Vince D’Amato’s 29-yard field goal in the fourth quarter gave Cal its only points of the game.
“The consistency of our defense is just great,” Carroll said of the squad that held Cal to 285 yards in total offense. “We love the guys [on defense] that left [to the NFL], but the guys that are here are playing really good football.”
Not to be forgotten in the Trojans’ dominating win was injured senior running back Stafon Johnson. Multiple Trojans wrote the number 13 or “S. Johnson” on their eye-paint to honor their teammate who is recovering from emergency surgery to repair his voice box after a freak weightlifting accident.
“I’m happy that we could play this game for Stafon,” Barkley said. “He was in our hearts the whole time and you could really tell. [It was a] great victory for us and for him.”
Not too hard for everything to come together against a really bad team. Congrats.
Great game.  The Barkley is the clear leader and starting QB.  Mustain should be the back-up.  Corp, I REALLY, REAALLLY think it is in the program’s best interest you transfer.  With alot of hard work and practice, I’m sure you would be a fine back-up QB for a Division 3 school.

The bounce is back.
USC’s dancing and chest-thumping on the sideline may be nothing new for the fans or players. Yet each hop and step seemed more emphatic than the moves the Trojans made in their sluggish first four games of the year.

And for a USC team that had not lived up to its own standard of play, Saturday’s 30-3 romp against Cal was a welcome demonstration of the Trojans’ confidence.
The match at Memorial Stadium was an exhibition of swagger against reticence with USC embodying the side of certitude. And though the Trojans have never lacked self-assurance in their approach, the blowout in Berkeley was the first time this year that the team played like it knew the outcome was predestined.
“We’ve known we were capable of that, but it’s been a long time coming,” USC coach Pete Carroll said.
This was the USC that television pundits had promised fans – long touchdowns from the offense, turnovers from the defense and gutsy calls from the coaching staff. This time, it all started with the stars.
As USC’s starting quarterback, Matt Barkley has had to be a leader by default. But on Saturday he showed how he’s taken on the team image – and vice versa.
Barkley told reporters earlier in the week that he didn’t think Cal’s crowd would be a factor after enduring raucous Ohio State fans.
The Cal student section took offense and distributed fliers with the quote, instructing fans to make Barkley eat his words. One of the sheets of paper even made it into the signal-caller’s helmet before the game.
“I thought about trying to pump up the crowd when we were on offense, but I don’t think it would have worked,” Barkley said.
Not that the USC offense needed much pumping up – 457 yards and 30 points was more than enough for a Trojans attack that still left plenty of points out on the field.
Though the offensive output didn’t reach new heights, USC still showed the level it can reach when its coaching staff isn’t clipping its wings.
“The way the offense is moving around is really starting to feel familiar to us, like the way we did it in the past,” Carroll said. “We’re doing it with confidence, but it’s just taken us a while.”
With Barkley allowed to throw downfield and test an occasionally suspect Cal secondary, USC’s passing attack showed it can pick up yards in large chunks.
“I think they’ve had that faith this whole time, but we’ve decided to open it up now. We’ll open it up whenever we need to,” Barkley said.
The faith shown in the offense may not be enough for those still expecting the offense to produce as it did when Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush were around, but consider USC’s opponent on Saturday before filing a formal complaint.
Despite entering the game with the Pac-10’s most productive offense, Cal coach Jeff Tedford looked like he was holding his breath on every play.
Somewhere along the line Tedford forgot that he could actually give the ball to his most talented player instead of only using him as a decoy. Cal tailback Jahvid Best only touched the ball on 16 plays and disappeared for large stretches of the game.
“It was frustrating,” Best said repeatedly while shaking his head.
Even on their home field, the Bears were terrified to take chances. Down 20-0 in the waning seconds of the first half, Tedford elected to kick a field goal on 2nd-and-10. Fans booed the decision as the kicking unit trotted out to the field and weren’t too thrilled when they saw the field goal sail wide right.
By the second half, the team looked as deflated as its cheering sections did. Instead of running out onto the field for the third quarter, Cal players looked like they were filing out of an office building during a fire drill.
“When you get on them early, it’s tough for the crowd to stay in it,” wide receiver Damian Williams said. “They just get demoralized.”
Given Cal’s shakiness, it’s hard to tell what the Trojans take away from the win. The Golden Bears were once been mentioned as a Rose Bowl contender, but at this point they might settle for a bowl sponsored by a manufacturer of men’s grooming and fragrance products – I’m looking at you, Brut Sun Bowl.
Regardless of the opponent, USC showed how difficult of a team it is to beat when it’s not stumbling over its own feet with penalties and turnovers. And if the other team gives them an opening, the Trojans are that much harder to take down.
“I think we showed tonight why we’re one of the best teams in the country,” Williams said.
USC still has plenty to improve upon – third-down conversions still aren’t optimal and three drives inside the 10 only resulted in field goals. But with a bye week on the horizon, the team will get a good look at its flaws.
And if Saturday was any indication, the Trojans should have enough hop in them to bounce back from those mistakes, too.

BERKELEY — The story: With Stafon Johnson hospitalized and unable to talk, the Trojans did all their talking on the field Saturday.
Most of the players had Johnson’s initials or his No. 13 written on their eye black. Many said he was part of their thoughts throughout the game. Many said he inspired them to win.

And with a balanced, well-rounded performance yet unseen out of the Trojans this season, No. 7 USC (4-1) dominated Cal 30-3.
Johnson underwent emergency surgery Monday after dropping a weight on his throat in Heritage Hall. Despite his absence, the senior running back was on the mind of his teammates.
“I was really happy that we could play this game for Stafon,” freshman quarterback Matt Barkley said. “He was in our hearts the whole time. It was a great victory for us and for him.”
Meanwhile, the No. 24 Bears (3-2) suffered their second consecutive embarrassing loss after falling 42-3 to No. 16 Oregon last week. And Cal’s ballyhooed preseason All-American Jahvid Best was again shut down, gaining just 51 total yards.
Key plays: 1. Cal drove down the field quickly to start the game, with an eight-yard run from Best, a facemask called on USC, and two 20-yard strikes from Kevin Riley putting the Golden Bears in a goal-to-go situation. But USC senior safety Taylor Mays made a leaping interception of a Riley throw in the end zone to stop the looming threat.
“We knew it was an early test for us, but we handled it,” said redshirt sophomore middle linebacker Chris Galippo. “Taylor just totally shut the whole stadium down with that interception.”
The Trojans turned around, scored in six plays, and never looked back. Cal wouldn’t get on the board until the fourth quarter.
“I think it was a great statement that we weren’t going to let [a Cal touchdown] happen,” Carroll said. “And even better than that was our drive after. We took advantage and drove 80 yards for the touchdown.”
Added Galippo: “People can see how much turnovers can mean with that one.”
2. The other key play happened early in the second quarter, as Williams returned a Bryan Anger punt 66 yards for a touchdown. The return was Williams’ first special teams score of his career as well as the first for the Trojans this season.
Williams eluded multiple Bears on the return and managed to tiptoe his way along the sideline before sneaking just inside the pylon.
“Ball security is the most important thing on that,” Williams said. “Once you use a few blocks, it’s kinda like running through a tunnel.”
Most valuable player: Running back Joe McKnight. The 6-foot, 190-pound junior rushed 20 times for 121 yards and two touchdowns. He didn’t fumble and lost yardage on only two carries — two weaknesses that have plagued him in the past.
“He’s fast and explosive,” said Cal linebacker Mike Mohamed of McKnight. “He’s pretty good.”
Surprise performance: Bradford had 53 yards on a career-high 12 carries as he established himself as the Trojans No. 2 running back behind McKnight. Bradford didn’t break any long runs — a 16-yard rush was his game-high — but he did rush for three first downs and provided a change of pace from the speedy McKnight.
“I’m a big back, so I have to be able to get key yardage,” Bradford said. “My role is extended, so I know I have to step up.”
Carroll had said that Bradford would be depended on more in the coming weeks.
“He’s gonna get better and better,” McKnight said of his backfield mate. “And he’s gonna have a bigger role against Notre Dame.”
Stat of the game: The Trojans were flagged just five times for a total of 55 yards. That number — especially when compared to last week’s first quarter total of seven penalties for 75 yards — displayed the team’s increased discipline.
“You could say that we were clicking on all cylinders tonight,” linebacker Michael Morgan said. “Not as many mistakes, not as many penalties.”
Quote of the game: “It’s about time.”
The Trojans said it was about time for a lot of things after the game Saturday.
“It’s about time Damian returned a punt for a touchdown,” said redshirt freshman receiver Brice Butler. “It’s about time.”
“It’s about time Taylor had an interception,” Williams said. “I’ve been telling him to get one for the last two years. That was a huge play.”
Added Williams: “And it’s about time for us as a team. I think we finally solidified why we’re one of the best teams in the nation.”
