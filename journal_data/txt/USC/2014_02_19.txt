A newly formed club that aims at exploring Southern California’s outdoor wonders through weekend hiking trips has plans to continue fostering relationships between students and professors this semester.

Peaks and Professors was formed in September 2013 as a way for students interested in hiking to establish more meaningful relationships with their professors.
Allegra Bishop, president of the club and a sophomore majoring in environmental sciences and health, said professors and students have the opportunity to bond over shared interests while hiking together.
“Even though this is Los Angeles, there are so many students and professors who love getting away in the outdoors,” Bishop said.
Bishop said one of her favorite memories from a trip was learning that a professor had started a satirical paper while he was in college.
Trips are limited to about 15 students to maintain the personal attention, the club’s executive members said. In past trips, both female and male undergraduates and graduates participated in the trip evenly.
Since its inception, the club has organized trips to Los Liones Canyon, the Devil’s Punchbowl and San Gabriel Valley, Bishop said. Several of the locations selected came from suggestions and input from both students and faculty.
Faculty advisor and chemistry professor Rebecca Broyer said that the trips are also beneficial for the professors who often struggle to gauge students’ individual personalities in large lecture classes.
“Trips like these help us communicate outside the normal way of interacting,” Broyer said. “[Professors] have other experiences and knowledge outside of our particular field of expertise, so on trips I can talk to students about studying abroad or my experience working in an art museum.”
Broyer, who has been teaching at the university for four years, said that she sees the program expanding in the future. Currently, faculty members have come from various disciplines across campus, ranging from the biology department to East Asian studies.
“It has a lot of room to grow, and I think it’s different for every faculty member involved,” Broyer said.
The club is looking to expand its trip lengths — all the trips taken last semester were daylong ones. In addition to planning overnight trips in the future, Bishop also said the club is looking to diversify the staff and faculty it works with.
“We’re looking to get more faculty involved,” Bishop said. “We’d love to do a hike with Nikias someday.”
Roshan Jayanti, a sophomore majoring in global health and club member who went on the trip to Malibu Creek State Park, said the concept of the organization convinced him to join the weekend trips.
“USC professors are incredible but you only see them for a short period,” Jayanti said. “Plus I love seeing trees and not concrete, and any chance I can find an affordable opportunity to do that, I will.”
Previous trips usually ranged from $5 to $10 in price because participants carpooled to save money.
Both club members and faculty advisors said the club can have a lasting impact on the campus and the types of professional relationships students develop with their professors.
“We started small but we really have big plans,” Bishop said. “We want it to be a well-known club and network where professors can be slated and lined up for future trips. The sky’s the limit.”
The next trip the club has planned will take place Sunday, Feb. 23 at Vasquez Rocks, with philosophy, law and political science professor, Sharon Lloyd.

On Wednesday, it was announced that Classical KUSC will soon be operating Santa Barbara’s classical music station KDB, pending approval from the Federal Communications Commission.
USC Radio President Brenda Barnes announced the new venture. With the acquisition, classical KUSC will become the only classical station in Santa Barbara, Calif.
KUSC’s operation of KDB solidifies the transition that KUSC has been undergoing for the last 10 years. KUSC has become the only classical service in all of Southern California as well as in the Bay Area.
KDB, the commercial classical music station owned by the Santa Barbara Foundation, has been around since the late 1920s. It was announced several months ago that the KDB station would be sold. In the announcement, the Santa Barbara Foundation stated that the KDB must continue to run as a classical station.
Classical KUSC, a nonprofit public station, already operates a radio station in Santa Barbara, KQSC.
Barnes noted in a press release that the Santa Barbara Foundation could no longer fund the KDB station.
“This is not their fault,” she said. “Classical music just does not work as a commercial radio format anymore, even in a place as unique and special as Santa Barbara.”
The real difference between a commercial radio format and a nonprofit radio format is selling commercials, Barnes said.
“The audience for classical music on the radio is more like 50 [years-old] plus,” she said. “And most advertisers are looking for 18 [year-olds] to 24 [years-olds]. So, we [as a nonprofit radio station] do not [have] the audience that is the ideal target for most advertisers.”
Barnes added, however, that the model can survive through donations.
“If your model is asking people to donate for the service, people who are 50 [years-old] and older, generally, especially classical music listeners who are educated, have disposable income that they are able to donate,” Barnes said. “That business plan and structure works a lot better than trying to sell ads.”
KDB was known as the local classical music station and was the station to broadcast the Santa Barbara Symphony and the Music Academy of the West. KUSC will now take over this coverage.
The letters KDB and the frequency 93.7 FM will remain the same as Classical KUSC takes over. KDB, however, will now have USC advertising at the top of each hour, something all other KUSC radio stations have.
Barnes noted the station should receive an announcement regarding the FCC’s decision in a couple months.
“We figure sometime in May is a reasonable estimate,” Barnes said. “It could be longer or it could be shorter, but that is about the amount of time it takes the FCC to look at a transaction like this.”
Update: In an earlier version of this article, the Daily Trojan wrote that KUSC purchased KDB. KUSC will operate KDB, but did not purchase it as money was not exchanged. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.
This headline and article are incorrect in writing that KUSC purchased Santa Barbara station KDB, as no money changed hands. Los Angeles radio station KCRW bought KDB and then swapped it for the classical music station that KUSC already owned in Santa Barbara. This will allow KDB to continue as a classical station — but one now operated by KUSC. (KCRW will expand its station’s coverage to Santa Barbara, using the frequency of the station that KUSC owned before the swap.) Also, the station in San Francisco is KDFC, not KUSC. Both are owned by USC Radio.

Student groups from both UCLA and USC hosted a joint town hall session Wednesday evening at UCLA in an ongoing response to the racist flier targeting Asian women that was mailed to both the UCLA Asian American Studies Center and USC Asian Pacific American Students Services. This followed a panel on social justice hosted by USC’s student groups last week.

Though the event focused on the response by the UCLA student community, Gloria Kim and Alison Chang, executive and assistant director, respectively, of the USC Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, were present as part of a panel discussion and made a statement expressing solidarity with UCLA.
“It’s very difficult to respond to micro-aggression as individuals, and that’s why it’s important for us to respond as a community,” Chang said. “Looking beyond our two campuses, it’s a broader issue for the APA community and for other communities of color.”
Representatives from UCLA Asian Pacific Coalition said that the administration has been helpful so far in responding to the incident.
“UCLA administration has been very supportive of our efforts, starting from the very first day,” said Anh Q. Nguyen, a UCLA student and president of the Vietnamese Student Union. “However, it has been a lot of student-initiated efforts, starting with the rally and now the photo campaign that’s taking place across California.”
She said that though dialogue is important, this is not the first incident to occur at UCLA and is indicative of a larger problem.
“Nothing has been done to give us a tangible solution,” Nguyen said. “This is a systemic problem, but it needs to start from the policymakers. We need more [Asian Pacific Islander] community members at the decision-making level so that there is someone who understands our concern.”
All panelists agreed that the focus should be on adjusting the culture surrounding the issue and apprehension of the suspects is secondary. They did note, however,  that both USC and UCLA campus police have been treating the issue seriously.
“Our very existence [as minority students] is a revolutionary act,” said Jazz Kiang of UCLA APC. “Even with the limited resources that we have … this attack is on a personal level, the objectification of Asian women was very apparent in the flier and that is something that people in the community suffer from.”
Following the panel discussion, the floor was opened to comments from the audience. A graduate student and native Hawaiian spoke about previous incidents of racism at UCLA, including an altercation with a white professor and refusal from the administration to take action.
“How many more incidents need to happen before UCLA realizes we have a lack of diversity education on this campus?” said a student who identified himself as the president of the Muslim Student Association. “People don’t know about other cultures [and] we can’t wait any longer — urge the academic senate to include a diversity requirement.”
The event concluded with a reading of a joint letter from USC APASA and UCLA APC, citing incidents of racism on both campuses and requesting support from the community. The letter also included demands from the Asian Pacific Islander community to UCLA’s administration, including annual programming for cultural groups, more Asian Pacific Islander representation on the chancellor’s staff, a multicultural center and a summit paid for by the chancellor.
Kim said USC APASA is focused on starting a dialogue with students and hopes to bring the conversation to the student community at large.
“We’re starting conversations with students,” Kim said. “But the reaction at USC has been quieter than at UCLA, and I think people will chalk this up as an isolated incident, and say we don’t have much of a history [of racial incidents], but we want to engage them and reach out to student leaders from other organizations outside the APA community.”

Sometimes, you’ve just got to take things into your own hands. Tahnee Cadrez, a senior majoring in visual and performing arts, realized this when, in a moment of senioritis panic, rented space on campus and decided to produce her self-written play all by herself.
“I told myself, ‘I’ll never be able to do this after I graduate,’” Cadrez said.
Her play, Surprise Party, will be performed in the Village Gate Theater on Feb. 21 and 22 at 8 p.m. It tells the story of Allen, the 20-something son of Billy and Ruth, who reveals to his parents that he is gay and having a baby with his partner of a year via  surrogate. In an attempt to show Allen that they are supportive of his lifestyle, his parents decide to throw a party in honor of their new grandchild-to-be. The party, however, goes haywire when Billy puts the wrong date on the invitation and other family secrets are revealed.
The play was originally a project for a basic playwriting class at USC, but Cadrez decided to explore the idea further in a directed research course with School of Dramatic Arts faculty member Oliver Mayer.
The events of the play are “pretty far-fetched,” Cadrez said. Most ideas for the plot just came to the writer during the process. She did not outline or plan the story.
“It sort of wrote itself,” Cadrez said. “I mean, it didn’t, it was hard, but I would be writing and think, ‘This would be a good twist.’”
For Cadrez, ideas come not while sitting at her computer, but when she is just walking around.
“I store it away and put it in later,” Cadrez said. “Sometimes it’s an image that inspires me. Or an idea will pop into my head, and I have to figure out how I am  going to get to that point in the story.”
Characters, however, are Cadrez’ passion.
“[I’m a] huge, huge advocate for character,” Cadrez said. “I could give a crap about a story. I’m all about who the person is and how to convey that. I just want to represent everyone accurately — not just make them an archetype or a stereotype.”
Two of the play’s main characters are gay, and Cadrez wanted to ensure she represented them in a realistic manner without stereotypes.
“I’m not going to put them in a feather boa,” Cadrez laughed.
And though it was not a conscious decision, many of the characters are based on people in Cadrez’s life.
“I think there’s always an element of someone you know in a character you write,” Cadrez said. “I focus on relationships, husband and wife, mother and son. That has been influenced by a real-life situation. But it’s subconscious. I’ll read and realize I’ve taken it from a real person in my life. It’s never deliberate, it’s always after the fact.”
Cadrez’s love for these characters is partly what motivated her to direct this production herself. In her first directing endeavor, Cadrez has greatly appreciated having actors to provide feedback on her play. This is the first time she has heard actors’ voices perform her text, something she finds exciting.
“I wanted to hear what the actors thought; they’ll say things like, ‘I don’t feel like I would say this,’ which is great,” Cadrez said.
Throughout the three-week rehearsal progress, the cast has had many discussions about different elements of the play. Many lines allude to the past, and the actors were eager to discover what Cadrez was referring to. Cadrez, however admitted, “They’ll ask me what happened, and I say, ‘I don’t know!’” As a group, they were able to reach conclusions about relationships and pasts.
Though Cadrez is enjoying the process, she admits the preparation was a bit thrown together. After renting the space in November, Cadrez got busy producing the recent production of RENT. January quickly rolled around and Cadrez realized she still hadn’t gotten a team together. She had to make adjustments, and decided to direct her own “rehearsed reading,” meaning the actors have some costumes and props, as well as blocking, but still hold scripts. The decision to direct it herself was a tough one. “I don’t want to mess it up, but I also don’t want to mess it up myself.”
Her decision to create this type of production was brought on not only by time and people restraints, but also for a deeper reason.
“A lot of [Independent Student Productions] aren’t read for a full production,” Cadrez said. “I think I was protecting myself a bit, subconsciously, by doing a rehearsed reading.”
Regardless, Cadrez is glad for this type of flexibility, because it allows her to change the lines up to the night before.
“It helps me restructure things, because it’s all in the throes of rewriting. It allows it to be all about the text,” Cadrez explained.
The production, funded by a highly successful “GoFundMe” online campaign, also found assistance from a San Francisco-based art support group called New Oppulence Arts.  The company works to encourage the production of original artwork of all forms, including plays.  NOA has helped Cadrez both with marketing and with credibility.
“[NOA] makes me seem more official by having their name to back me up,” Cadrez explained.
Cadrez hopes the audience talkbacks after the performances will help her receive more feedback on the play. She is looking forward to continuing to pursue playwriting in Los Angeles after graduating. Cadrez knows playwriting is not an easy path to take, but plans to stick with it for as long as possible.
“It will be a freelance thing for a while — a long long while,” Cadrez said. “But even if it’s just a hobby, I’m down with that, because it’s fun.”

Why does it feel so good to root for the bad guy?
Chillin’ like a villain · Frank Underwood played by Kevin Spacey expands his Machiavellian web of influence in the second season of Netflix’s original series House of Cards, released on Friday, Feb. 14. All thirteen episodes of the second season are available now on Netflix. – Photo courtest of AP
The greatest villains alternately attract and repel their audiences, drawing us in close before going for the jugular. Some seduce us with their beauty, ambition or corrupted sense of righteousness. Others dazzle us with the polish of their silver tongues. A few steal our sympathy with heartrending back stories. The best of the worst, however, manage something far more insidious: they deceive us — and sometimes even their own creators — into believing that they’re the heroes. Frank Underwood, the ruthless House Majority Whip played with diabolical bravura by Kevin Spacey on the Netflix political thriller House of Cards, is the latest in a long line of increasingly antagonistic protagonists: the modern antihero.
From the beginning of the series — its opening scene finds Frank strangling an injured dog while delivering an eerie direct address on the futility of “useless pain” — it’s clear that this man is bad news. What some would mistake for a mercy killing is actually a callous expression of contempt for weak and worthless things. This isn’t Atticus Finch valiantly shooting a rabid dog in To Kill a Mockingbird. The scene is more in the vein of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, when the evil Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) dips that poor little anthropomorphic shoe into the bubbling vat of acid and giggles while it burns alive.
It’s also the first of many indications that Frank has all the makings of a classic villain: an insatiable lust for power, an obsession with settling old scores — namely against those who blocked his Secretary of State appointment — and an equally cunning and duplicitous partner (his wife Claire, played by Robin Wright) to share in his schemes. Even the character’s penchant for shattering the fourth wall — effectively recruiting the viewers as his co-conspirators — calls to mind the devious soliloquies of Shakespeare’s Iago, Richard III and, of course, Macbeth.
A lesser show would have relegated Frank and Claire to supporting roles, serving as crooked obstacles for some Mr. Smith-style protagonist to confront and ultimately vanquish in his or her quest to clean up Washington. But House of Cards, adapted from the 1990 BBC series of the same name, puts this power-mad power couple front and center, allowing the audience no respite from their toxic allure.
The second season, which Netflix began streaming in its entirety appropriately on Valentine’s Day, follows Frank as he attempts to lock down the Vice Presidency for himself while dealing with the ongoing fallout from the murder of a fellow congressman, the machinations of his many rivals and the investigative instincts of his pet journalist and part-time paramour Zoe Barnes, played by Kate Mara.
“One heartbeat away from the presidency and not a single vote cast in my name,” Frank says, favoring his silent confidant with a wolfish sneer. “Democracy is so overrated.”
Frank is a wonderfully written character and Spacey is a wicked delight in the role, but he’s stomping on well-trodden ground. The granddaddy of the modern TV antihero is Tony Soprano, played by the late James Gandolfini, a mobster and conflicted family man forced into therapy after suffering a crippling panic attack. The field has only grown more crowded in the years since The Sopranos first premiered on HBO, with shows such as AMC’s Mad Men and Showtime’s Dexter often dominating the conversation, but the  strongest recent example is undoubtedly Bryan Cranston’s Walter White from Vince Gilligan’s recently concluded AMC crime drama, Breaking Bad.
Walt’s five-season journey from milquetoast chemistry teacher to drug kingpin captured our collective imagination, showing us the American Dream’s morally blackened underbelly and turning the sun-scorched vistas of Albuquerque, N.M. into a vast, purgatorial wasteland of the soul. The show’s intent was clear from the pilot episode, when Mr. White tells his students that chemistry is the study of change: growth, decay and transformation. The series stuck to that pattern with fittingly scientific precision, charting the warped character arc of a man who used his family and a terminal cancer diagnosis as an excuse for channeling his inner Pablo Escobar.
No matter what depraved depths Walter White, Dexter Morgan, Don Draper and Frank Underwood ultimately sink to, there will always be those ready to identify with them. After all, it’s difficult to deny the vicarious satisfaction that comes from watching a character like Frank dominating his surroundings, punishing his enemies and imposing his will in the face of bureaucratic indolence and partisan bickering. In fact, compared to the current state of U.S. politics, it’s downright refreshing.
Besides, Frank’s self-serving actions often have beneficial and far-reaching consequences, such as the education bill that was passed during the first season. Even the leader of the free world isn’t immune to that sort of wish fulfillment. During a recent meeting with a group of tech CEOs, President Barack Obama confessed to a guarded admiration of Spacey’s character, saying, “I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient. It’s true. It’s like Kevin Spacey, man, this guy’s getting a lot of stuff done.”
Maybe that’s the lesson at the heart of the moral vacuum that is House of Cards: Sometimes it takes a Machiavellian bastard such as Frank Underwood to actually get things done in Washington, D.C. He’s evil, yes, but he’s a necessary evil. Maybe that’s why we’re still rooting for him.

Are you tired of the same on-campus eateries? Are you looking for a change? Venture to FIGat7th and experience taste-bud adrenaline at Torta Co., a new Mexican sandwich shop that opened this week.
Torta Co., located adjacent to Lotería Grill in the FIG@7th food court, is owned and operated by Jimmy and Andrew Shaw, two brothers who grew up in Mexico City loving torta sandwiches. The Shaws own Lotería Grill restaurants in Santa Monica, Hollywood, Thousand Oaks and Studio City. They also operate the popular Lotería Grill stand at The Farmer’s Market, established in 2002. The Shaw brothers initially wanted to include tortas on the menu at Lotería Grill, but decided against this.
“Before I opened Lotería, I wanted to have tortas on the menu, but I was always disappointed in the bread,” Jimmy Shaw told LAist. “I was able to figure out how to do the bread. When I felt good about that, then we decided to open this.”
Upon biting into one of the Shaws’ sandwiches, it is clear they have figured out “how to do the bread.” At Torta Co., the sandwich bread is baked in-house daily. The rectangular bread has a crunchy outer layer which conceals an ultra-soft center. Each sandwich is heated on an open-top grill in authentic Mexican style.
“The problem I have with tortas in L.A. is the bread — it’s too soft on the outside and lacks texture,” Jimmy Shaw told Los Angeles Magazine. “It’s also bigger than what we are used to in Mexico.”
Upon entering to the food court, it is apparent that Torta Co. values the quality of its ingredients. Sandwich fillings include fresh, locally grown vegetables, various peppers and sauces and a variety of meats.
Vegetarians will enjoy the Tinga de Setas, an option made with oyster mushrooms, smoky tomatoes, onions, chipotle sauce, pinto beans, Oaxacan cheese and avocado. The savory mushrooms only enhance the sandwich’s flavor because they complement the crunchy beans well. This sandwich has a little kick because of the chipotle sauce, so expect a little heat. Overall, this sandwich is a pleasant surprise.
I found the holy grail in the form of the Jamón y Queso, a heavenly concoction of smoked black forest ham, white cheddar cheese, black beans, tomato, avocado, onion, and chipotle mayo. The perfectly smoked ham gave the sandwich a rustic heartiness; the ham’s deep, smoky flavor perfectly complemented the mild cheddar cheese. The thin layer of black beans combined with the toasted torta bread gave the sandwich an extremely satisfying crunch. This beautiful marriage of American and Mexican flavors was only enhanced by the rich avocado and chipotle mayo.
Anyone looking to bookend his or her meal with dessert should try one of Torta Co.’s dessert sandwiches,  such as the Banana Cajeta Torta. This sandwich is a reasonably sized sandwich filled with sautéed bananas, goat’s milk caramel and candied pecans. The sautéed bananas were warm, soft and comforting, while the caramel packed a sweet punch. The crunchy pecans added nice texture to the dish. Many desserts, especially dessert sandwiches or crepes, tend to be cloyingly sweet or have an unappetizing, mushy texture. This sandwich was sweet enough to satisfy dessert needs without being overbearing. It was also incredibly filling. Even though a sweeter sandwich bread would have made this a more satisfying dessert, this sandwich was a solid end to a great meal.
“We are doing typical tortas that you’d find in Mexico City like ham and cheese, and turkey,” Shaw told Los Angeles Magazine. “They will appeal to Mexicans and non-Mexican palates as well. Then we’ll do other more Mexican-style tortas like chicken milanesa, or carne deshebrada (stewed, shredded beef).”
Torta Co. combines classic Mexican flavors and ingredients with an American twist. Each sandwich makes for a satisfying meal and contains interesting flavor combinations that play with texture. Every item on the menu seems like it was carefully thought out, so you won’t find your boring ham and cheese here.
The atmosphere at Torta Co. is lively and fun. Conveniently located next to the food court’s entrance, customers are greeted with the inviting aroma of freshly baked bread. A case of freshly baked torta bread is on display next to the registers, along with decorative sodas and glasses. Torta Co.’s staff is friendly and welcoming; each server had a favorite sandwich and all were eager to make recommendations. Sandwiches are regular-sized, but very filling. Menu items range in price from around $3 for sides to $10 for some sandwiches.
Torta Co. is a welcome change of pace from more traditional sandwich shops and is worth a lunchtime visit.
 
Torta Company is located inside the FIGat7th food court at 
735 S Figueroa St., Los Angeles, CA 90017

USC’s men’s golf team experienced a disappointing setback at this week’s Prestige Tournament, finishing well behind the leaders in ninth place. The No. 24 Trojans suffered from uncharacteristically poor individual play, especially from the team’s top two seeds, senior Jeffrey Kang and junior Anthony Paolucci. Freshman Rico Hoey, USC’s third seed, also struggled to match his early-season form.

No. 9 Stanford took home the title yesterday at PGA West Golf Course in La Quinta, Calif., finishing just two strokes ahead of No. 14 Washington. Another Pac-12 rival, No. 15 UCLA, was a distant third.
Though the Trojans improved in every round of the tournament, the team never recovered from a sluggish 4-over performance over Monday’s opening 18 holes. The teams combined for a solid 3-under yesterday, but could not make up the 25-stroke lead that Stanford opened up during the first two rounds. Head coach Chris Zambri was not pleased with the overall result.
“We finished ninth out of 12 teams,” Zambri said. “So we certainly would not characterize it as anything but a poor showing.”
Leading the charge for USC was the unexpected tandem of juniors Eric Sugimoto and Paul Smith. Sugimoto, the Trojans’ fourth seed, led the team with an even-par total over three days. The San Diego native finished in a 21st-place tie after firing consecutive scores of 1-under 70 after a first-round 2-over 73. Smith was just off the pace set by Sugimoto, stringing together two 71s with a 73 to combine for a 2-over. The Trojans’ fifth seed finished in a tie for 28th.
Neither Smith nor Sugimoto had cracked USC’s starting lineup prior to this event, but the pair benefitted from poor performances by the team’s previous lower seeds at last week’s Amer Ari Invitational in Hawaii. Zambri saw the strong play of his two lowest-seeded players as a silver lining.
“It was great to get some fine play out of our four and five positions,” Zambri said. “That is what gave us some problems in Hawaii.”
On the flip side, the Trojans’ top seeds underperformed. Paolucci went into yesterday’s final round at 2-under, but a team-worst 5-over 76 knocked him into a tie for 35th place. Hoey, USC’s second place finisher in Hawaii, salvaged scores of 73 and 75 in the first two rounds with a 2-under 69 yesterday. Still, the team’s third seed tied for 39th.
Perhaps the biggest surprise for USC was senior Jeffrey Kang, who failed to shoot a single round under par, and finished in a 52nd-place tie aftering entering the tournament as the Trojans’ top seed.
Zambri felt that the poor play of his top players may not be as bad of a sign as it appears to be, and is sure that Paolucci, Kang and Hoey will return to form soon.
“I know that our top three guys will contribute greatly going forward,” Zambri said. “So all in all it was a tough week but there [were] some bright spots.”
The Trojans return to action early next week at the Jones Sport Invitational in Ventura, Calif.

USC is entering a seminal period in its athletic history.
That statement might sound like hyperbole. And I admit I have a tendency to be hyperbolic. But it is true. The next five years will tell us a lot about the USC athletic program.
Consider this: In the 2013 calendar year, six of USC’s 19 head coaches left the school — more than 30 percent (USC has 21 athletic programs, but Jovan Vavic coaches both men’s and women’s water polo, and track and field has one head coach for both genders). Last January, men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill was “relieved of duties.” A month later, baseball coach Frank Cruz was “terminated.” Women’s basketball coach Michael Cooper “resigned” following the season in March. Legendary track and field coach Ron Allice retired in June. And as we all know, football coach Lane Kiffin was fired in September, as was women’s soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin in November.
Officially speaking, that’s one retirement, four firings and one resignation, although I would not be the first to speculate that Cooper’s resignation was forced. Six new head coaches that athletic director Pat Haden and company hired over the span of 12 months. And though the rate of turnover is remarkable, what makes it especially significant is the high-profile sports affected.
Football, men’s basketball and baseball are the three prominent athletic programs at this school. That’s not to say they are the best, but they do receive the most attention, with women’s hoops a clear fourth before the likes of volleyball, water polo and soccer. So those are USC’s four most prominent athletic programs, all in the midst of a firing and subsequent coaching change.
And all of this comes among a major overhaul to USC’s athletic facilities — the John McKay Center’s construction, Heritage Hall’s refurbishment and the Uytengsu Aquatics Center’s creation, which will give water polo something more than a rec pool to compete in, have all come to fruition recently. On top of that, USC has added two brand new sports in the last two years in women’s lacrosse and sand volleyball, both entering their second seasons of play this spring.
Very little about the most prominent aspects of the USC athletic program is the same as they were four or even two years ago. And who knows what the case will be in another half-decade — or possibly less? What will we say about the USC Trojans, football and otherwise, come 2018? What will we say about Pat Haden?
Of course, it is much too early to speculate. The football team hasn’t even played a single game yet under new head coach Steve Sarkisian. Early returns on new women’s basketball coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke are promising, but the jury is still out. New men’s basketball coach Andy Enfield is just trying to slog through a hopeless season with the mess of a roster he inherited before bringing in his own recruits. And though baseball had its worst season in decades in head coach Dan Hubbs’ first year at the helm in 2013, the consensus is that things will be very different at Dedeaux Field in 2014, where this season’s team has opened up the year 4-0.
And yet, even by the end of 2014, what will any of us really know? Realistically, when can we make meaningful judgments about the direction of these  programs? On the flip side, how long is too long before deciding to pull the plug on a coach? Those are all impossible questions, but ones that USC will have to answer quite a few times in the years to come.

Pat Haden is still in the middle of a minefield, remaining intelligent, thoughtful, and making decisions for the long run.  He is USC to the core, and we are lucky to have him around.  I hope he stays around for a long time.  Just consider Haden NOT being the Athletic Director.  See what I mean?
Women tennis coach ( Gallien ) and men golf coach ( Zambri ) should be next in order to be replaced this year.
Men volleyball coach ( Ferguson ) is on the brink with the rest of the season to prove his worth.

A double header with the Hawai’i Rainbow Warriors this week should offer two strong tests for the USC men’s volleyball team, which is still looking to break out from the middle of the pack in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation standings. After splitting two matches last week, the Trojans hope to string together a three-game winning streak for the first time since the opening three games of the season with matches against Hawai’i today and on Saturday.
Back in action · Junior setter Micah Christenson missed USC’s last two matches due to injury, but will return for the matches against Hawai’i. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (7-5, 6-5 MPSF) lost in five sets to UC Irvine (9-7, 6-6) by a score of 22-25, 25-17, 25-17, 24-26, 15-13 last Thursday, but came back the next day to sweep UC San Diego (0-13, 0-12) on Friday by a score of 25-13, 25-21, 25-15.
The Trojans had previously beaten UCI in five sets earlier this year at home by a score of 20-25, 25-21, 23-25, 25-19, 15-10, but had less luck on the road against the two-time defending national champions.
“We played fantastic in the first set,” said USC head coach Bill Ferguson. “Irvine played fantastic in sets two, three and most of game four, but we came back and won. We were down a few in the fifth and we kept battling, and a guy got hot at the serving line and aced us twice. We had a ton of effort, which was great. I thought we put our best foot forward against a good team. We always want to win and we never want to go with [moral] victories but all in all I thought we played pretty well.”
The Trojans were able to rebound at UCSD, who the Trojans also swept by a score of 25-17, 25-23, 25-22 back in January.
“I thought we played very well on Friday night,” Ferguson said. “We executed our game plan perfectly. The first night I thought we showed some real character and the second night we did what we were supposed to do.”
The Trojans played both matches last week without junior setter Micah Christenson, who was out with back spasms. Redshirt freshman Michael Mullahey got both of the starts in place of Christenson, who has held down the starting role all three years he’s been a Trojan.
“Thursday was Mullahey’s first college volleyball match setting and he filled in for the best guy in the business,” Ferguson said. “I thought he did a really nice job and followed the game plan really well.”
The lineup last week also featured sophomore middle blocker Tommy Leonard for the first time this year, who might factor into the rotation of middles more often down the road along with junior Robert Feathers, junior Chris Lischke and freshman Andy Benesh.
Hawai’i (9-4, 7-4) comes into the Galen Center ranked as the No. 11 team in the country, according to the American Volleyball Coaches Association poll. USC is currently ranked No. 8. Hawai’i is tied for third place in MPSF standings, while the Trojans are ranked seventh in the 13-team conference.
“They’re definitely a dangerous team,” Benesh said. “They’re a really good serving team, really good blocking team. It should be a lot of fun.”
Feathers said the key to the games for the Trojans will be serving and passing.
“[We’ll succeed] if we get them off their groove and serve well and pass well,” Feathers said. “Especially because they serve well, we can get them out of rhythm and we’ll be fine.”
Rather than play at home and on the road against each MPSF team throughout the season, Hawai’i will either play each conference opponent twice at home or on the road then switch locations the following year to reduce the amount of traveling the team has to do across the Pacific. Because of this, Benesh said the Trojans will have to be able to make quick adjustments following Thursday’s game for the second half of the double header Saturday since Hawai’i is very experienced at doing so.
“They have more expertise in playing back-to-back,” he said. “They have a little more experience with that so hopefully we can prepare well, especially for the second time.”
Ferguson said that Christenson will be back for both of the games this week. He will start along with senior libero Henry Cassiday, freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder, senior opposite Tanner Jansen and Benesh. He said that either Feathers, Leonard or Lischke would start at the second middle blocker spot and either redshirt junior Joey Booth, sophomore Alex Slaught or redshirt senior Maddison McKibbin would start at the second outside hitter spot.
Both matches start at 7 p.m.

The struggling USC men’s basketball team (10-15, 1-11 Pac-12) will take to the hardwood again tonight, this time as visitor in Palo Alto as they square off against the Stanford Cardinal (16-8, 7-5).
Serbian sensation · Freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic has been a steady contributor for USC this season, averaging 20.7 minutes of playing time per game. He is one of four Trojans to have played in every game this year. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
The two squads met earlier in conference play in a very competitive game that needed an extra period to determine a winner. In overtime the Trojans were eventually outpaced and fell by a score of 79-71. Stanford guard Chasson Randle proved to be the difference maker, scoring seven of his 17 points for the Cardinal in overtime. The Rock Island, Ill. native is one of the best scorers in the Pac-12 this year, averaging more than 18 points per contest.
The Trojans will be looking for their elusive second conference win following yet another loss over the weekend to Colorado. In that matchup, the Trojans were abysmal from the offensive end of the floor, shooting less than 38 percent from the field en route to a 83-74 defeat at the hands of the Buffaloes.
Senior guard Pe’Shon Howard was suspended for the Colorado contest for an unspecified violation of team rules, and sophomore back-up guard Chass Bryan started in place for him.
While the team results have been disappointing of late, Trojan faithful can take solace in junior guard Byron Wesley’s dominant play. Over  his last five games, Wesley is averaging 22.0 points. This season he is the only player in the Pac-12 leading his team in both points and rebounds per game.
For USC to defeat the Cardinal, Wesley will need to have another  strong performance. Additionally, freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic will be asked to have one of his better games. Jovanovic has been a pleasant surprise for the Trojans this year, averaging 8.1 points and 4.6 rebounds per game.
The Trojans are 8-1 in contests in which the Belgrade, Serbia native has scored in double figures. In their lone conference victory, on Jan. 22 against Cal, Jovanovic had the best game of his young USC career, scoring 23 points and proving to be an immovable force down low.
Jovanovic will get his chance to repeat his dominance over the Golden Bears this weekend; following the Stanford contest USC will make the short trip to Berkeley, Calif. to battle a 17-8 Cal squad riding the momentum of two straight wins.
Justin Cobbs is averaging 16.0 points per game for the Golden Bears and dropped 22 in last month’s game against the Trojans.
With USC’s current record, receiving an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament in March is out of the question, so the Trojans will have to hope for a dream run through the Pac-12 tournament if they are to take part in any postseason play.
The Trojans have not made the NCAA tournament since 2011, when they went 19-14 in former head coach Kevin O’Neill’s third year at the helm.
With only a handful of regular season games left, the Trojans will have to find some of their old magic to avoid a quick exit from the conference tournament.

In a new book titled The Right Path, former Republican Congressman and current MSNBC host Joe Scarborough lays out a vision for politics, and the Republican party in particular, that is based not on ideology, but on pragmatism. The more ideological a particular candidate becomes, Scarborough argues, the more successful they become within their own party — but at the cost of becoming electable on a national level.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
As society moves forward, issues once thought to be ideological now find themselves squarely in the pragmatic column. These are issues that are no longer painted red or blue and should no longer appear on a party platform. The sooner candidates from both parties identify these issues and move to expunge them from their rhetoric, the better.
For an overwhelming majority of Americans, equal protection of the laws for everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, is one of those issues. In the last year, two Supreme Court decisions and ballot initiatives in several states have cemented a legal pattern toward greater equality and acceptance for same-sex marriage. Two weeks ago, the Justice Department announced it will publish a policy memo that administers equal protection for lawful, same-sex marriages to any and all of the services that it provides, which include everything from prison visits to courthouse proceedings.
In the face of such sweeping legal change, it’s important to remember that changes in the law must be accompanied by changes in culture for society to truly be more accepting. The last two weeks offer remarkable proof of that cultural shift.
First there was the Kansas State legislature, which nearly cemented its place in legislative purgatory when its House of Representatives passed, by a 72-49 vote, a bill that would legalize discrimination of same-sex couples by individuals or businesses that refuse them service on the basis of religious belief. After a storm of public outcry, the state Senate announced they would kill the bill in its current form. Though a majority of the senators support traditional marriage, the party leadership announced that they drew a firm line in the sand at discrimination.
Though the Kansas story is remarkable, it illustrates that even in the face of remarkable progress, we must always be cognizant of efforts by the dangerous minority to subvert the will of the majority. Ironically, the bill in question wasn’t even drafted in Kansas — it was written by the American Religious Freedom Program (whose views on the intersection of equality and religious liberty are clearly in the minority) in Washington, D.C.
In any case, the 72 elected officials who voted for the bill in the House should take some of their own medicine, particularly the medicine they freely distribute to the people of Kansas: It’s none of government’s business what you do in your private life, as long as it spends time and energy protecting you from people who want to make your life miserable.
Silence on the issue of equality is also soon to be as taboo as opposing the issue itself. As long as some states have constitutions that prohibit the right of gays to have equal protection under the laws, silence is still an ideological choice, not a practical one. It means those running for office have avoided talking about it because they’re uncomfortable with it, which means they can’t be counted on as allies when the time comes.
Ellen Page gave a speech at Human Rights Campaign’s “Time to Thrive” conference in Las Vegas over the weekend, in which she both came out as gay and offered support for those at the conference.
“I’m inspired to be in this room because every single one of you is here for the same reason,” Page said in her speech. “You’re here because you’ve adopted as a core motivation the simple fact that this world would be a whole lot better if we just made an effort to be less horrible to one another.”
No matter what, we’re on the right path.

Earlier this month, USC’s Asian Pacific American Student Services and UCLA’s Asian American Studies Center received an anonymous hate-filled flier in the mail. The derogatory statements in these posters make it clear that prejudice and racism are still underlying issues in the United States.
Instead of ignoring the presence of racism or dismissing each hateful incident as a onetime occurrence, minority groups must collaborate and present a united front against prejudice. Though the call for acceptance is nothing new, recent events make it clear that it is an appeal that still needs to be heard. Yet, this request for collective action is taking a new shape through the use of social media as a tool for empowerment.
The racism present in the United States is clearly different from the time of Jim Crow laws in previous decades; the prejudices that exist today are of a more subtle variety. This modern racism is like a virus and merits a more nuanced treatment. These contemporary problems, however, have contemporary solutions. Just as activists have utilized the internet to further their causes, individuals should embrace the usage of social networking sites to be used as tools to treat this problem.
More than two thirds of American adults use social media sites, according to the Pew Research Internet Project. This increase in digital networking allows users across the globe to interact in real time. Pew notes that social media users are doing more than checking their friends’ Facebook statuses; 66 percent of users have voiced their political opinions or promoted civic activity via social media.
Mary Ho, director of USC’s APASS, feels that one of the barriers to undercutting biases is the people’s inability to share their narratives and create a dialogue with society.
“Cross-cultural coalition building is important,” Ho said.
Social media allows for an instantaneous response to episodes of racism. As Ho recognized, incidents of prejudice “open up a dialogue about issues people do not readily talk about.” Though her response referred to the anonymous, hate-filled flier mailed to the APASS office, it demonstrates that negative incidents can promote positive conversation.
Though unjustified instances of prejudice promote discussion about key issues that often go unacknowledged, the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly used the incident with the racist fliers as an opportunity to harness the power of social media in a photo campaign, #BeyondtheStereotype. Participants wrote words of encouragement on their arms and posted their images to a Tumblr page, managed by the UCLA Asian Pacific Coalition and Vietnamese Student Union.
Instead of simply stating the issue, social media enables users to see and experience the problem through photos, videos and personal anecdotes. It allows activists to spread their message and facilitates communication across geographic boundaries. The #BeyondtheStereotype photo campaign, for example, extends to all minority groups and seeks to combat the systematic prejudices. This combination of active participation with the media platform, Tumblr, demonstrates an intelligent use of social media.
Still, social media should be used to assist activism, not replace it. “Liking” something on Facebook or sharing something on Twitter cannot replace physical activism.  Matthew Ingram, a journalist who specializes in social media, calls this misconception “slacktivism,” or lazy activism. Though slacktivists have the desire to help affect change, the extent of their participation is superficial and confined to the virtual realm.
Just as it is unacceptable to cite Wikipedia in an academic setting, readers must think critically about the biases inherent in the media they use. Individuals must examine their own biases before addressing larger issues. This conscious acknowledgement of personal biases can be the first step to addressing societal racism. Clearly, media can be part of the solution to addressing pervasive prejudices — it is an avenue for raising awareness and communicating to diverse groups of people. Social justice campaigns, however, should not replace concrete action. Unlike mindless internet surfing, social media activism can, and should, be a participatory event.

The Dept. of Public Safety is investigating fliers filled with derogatory references to Asian women that were mailed to   Asian-American organizations on the USC and UCLA campuses on Feb. 1. The Asian Pacific American Student Services Department received a flier containing racist and sexist slurs about Asian women dating white men.
DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said the department is investigating and speaking with UCLA safety officials but they have yet to produce any leads.
In an open letter to the USC community, APASS Director Mary Ho said the department “will not tolerate such harmful, derogatory and racist slurs directed at the Asian Pacific American community or at any communities.”
UCLA students organized a rally against the flier sent to the Asian American Studies Center with about 50 students participating, according to the Los Angeles Times.
UCLA Chancellor Gene Block asked campus police to investigate the situation, according to a statement released Monday.
“It’s an active investigation,” UCPD Spokesperson Nancy Greenstein said. “I think everybody’s looking at how we can identify the person who’s doing this.”
Block pledged that UCLA will “combat racism and bigotry so that the campus can be the welcoming, respectful environment our community deserves.”
UPDATE, Feb. 19: On Feb. 18, Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry sent a statement regarding the degoratory fliers to USC students via email:
“On February 1st an anonymous letter was sent to the Asian Pacific American Student Services office at the University of Southern California. The letter contained racist, sexist, and hateful language. The same letter was also sent to UCLA’s Asian American Studies Center.
“The University of Southern California denounces the derogatory language used in this letter. We support the firm and thoughtful responses offered by the Asian Pacific American Student Services department, which is part of the USC Division of Student Affairs, and USC student organizations APASS and SCAPE. I am especially proud of the way students at USC and UCLA have responded.
“USC enrolls more international students than any other American university. We enroll significant numbers of under-represented minority students, about 19 percent of our total undergraduate population. About 21 percent of our incoming students are first-generation college students. Students of Asian origin make up about 23 percent of our undergraduate population.
“Our diversity is a point of pride and strength for us, and an asset to our community. The hateful language expressed in this flier is not reflective of our community values.”

“Date With a Feminist” isn’t exactly a stereotypical title for a rap song, but Frak isn’t exactly a stereotypical rapper.
When he’s not rapping or making beats, the twenty-year old Pitzer College sophomore is debating sociological issues with friends or in class, studying creative writing and media studies. Over the last few years, Frak, also known as Alex Fraknoi, has become increasingly successful at translating his trademark artistic honesty into cultural relevance.

His latest single, “Date With a Feminist,” takes this trend to new heights. The song, released on Soundcloud on February 12, is a hilarious, and uncannily perceptive depiction of college life.
Frak’s unique relationship with rap can be traced to his initial experiences with the genre. His first heavy doses of rap music came from his classmates’ Bar Mitzvah parties in San Francisco. From the get-go, Frak’s understanding of the  art form demanded the reconciliation of incongruous ideas. Frak said he remembers inappropriately dancing and singing along to the songs of rappers like of Lil Jon and T-Pain.
“It was highly explicit stuff, and it was culture shock to a little Jewish boy,” Frak said.
In the subsequent years, Frak said he discovered the genre could also include substantive and thoughtful artists. Kanye West’s “The College Dropout,” in particular, ignited his love for the art form. Rap served as a window into unfamiliar worlds for young Frak, considering his upbringing as an upper-middle class white kid in San Francisco. In fact, the multiculturalism of rap may have had a significant impact on his worldview.
“Going to an all Jewish middle school made me want to immediately diversify my friend group in high school, almost calculatedly. I almost had two friends of every race. It was like Noah’s ark,” Frak said.
His freshman year of high school, Frak formed a rap group called 4real with his friends Sean Hurd and Javonte Holloway.
“We made very positive music about big concepts like unity and war and stuff that we didn’t fully understand, but we just wanted to put something positive into the world. Since then my style has tried to capture broader issues but with very personal storytelling,” Frak said.
His latest single, “Date With a Feminist,” not only displays his storytelling prowess, but also demonstrates that he can tell stories that matter to his generation. The tableaus he presents in the song, from a college pre-game, to the painfully awkward dance floor at a party, to the cafeteria the next day, will likely strike chords of familiarity with many college students. These scenes highlight the paradox of the contemporary college experience, where students are often painfully aware of the power structures behind their extra-curricular debauchery.
Prominent publications like The New York Times print exposés on “hookup culture,” and the constant barrage of Huffington Post College posts shows that these issues matter to students too. However, these articles can sometimes have a holier-than-thou tone, originating from concerned middle aged parents on one side and young people who feel victimized by contemporary social systems on the other.
Frak, on the other hand, eloquently explores the same issues through the lens of lived experience, striving to be as non-judgmental as possible.
“Although it’s very honest, I also think it has academic qualities to it,” Frak said of the song.
Indeed, the song is successful in that it marries academic thinking with pop culture sensibilities, while remaining almost uncomfortably genuine.
At the age of thirteen, Frak was forced to consider how Flo Rida and “freaking” had somehow become part of the Jewish rite of passage. Today, Frak explores more grown up versions of similar cultural discrepancies. But unlike the wide-eyed thirteen year old on the dance floor at the St. Regis in San Francisco, the sweaty, stoned artist on the dance floor at Pitzer is really saying something, and people are starting to listen.

Despite a foursome of new releases, The Lego Movie repeated at No. 1 with a $62.5M four-day weekend, nearly outranking 2010’s Valentine’s Day ($63.1M) as the highest President’s Day Weekend on record. Its three-day weekend total of $49.85M was a slight drop from its $69.1M opening and, with two more weeks to itself, the toy feature could finish over $250M.
Opening at No. 2 was About Last Night, starring Kevin Hart, Michael Ealy, Regina Hall and Joy Bryant, with a $25.65M three-day/$27.84M four-day opening. The romantic comedy, which is a remake of the 1986 adaptation of David Mamet’s 1974 stage play, reached No. 1 on Valentine’s Day before falling behind. The appeal of the cast, especially Kevin Hart , who is still in the top six with his comedy Ride Along, and the good reviews made it the best date option for couples over the weekend.
It didn’t open as strongly as 2012’s Think Like A Man, which starred many of the same actors and actresses, which earned $33.64M for its opening weekend and $91.5M total back in 2012. But with a $12.5M budget, it’s already profitable. The goodwill from this film should only increase the anticipation for Think Like A Man Too, which brings back the same cast and comes out June 20.
At No. 3 was the remake of 1987 action flick RoboCop, starring Joel Kinnaman as a police officer transformed into a robotic crime-fighting machine, which earned $25.06M over the four-day weekend and has accumulated $30M since its Wednesday opening. This is in line with Sony’s remake of another Paul Verhoeven sci-fi feature of Total Recall, which opened to $25.57M back in 2012 and finished with a disappointing $58.87M.
This film faced similar problems as the Total Recall remake. While the advertisements emphasized current concerns and topics of interest, like drones and a corrupt corporate-military complex and human augmentation, the film seemed to go back to mimic its predecessor too often.
While it looked exciting and action-packed (the director José Padhila was behind the Brazlian action-film Elite Squad), it seemed to fall into the trap of graphical prowess at the cost of realism or vision (for a dark and impoverished future, Detroit sure looks like the inside of an Apple store). Its PG-13 rating also promised a more sterile and subdued experience than the original, which used ultraviolence to near-comedic satirical levels.
At No. 5 was the second 1980s romantic remake, Endless Love, starring Alex Pettyfer and relative newcomer Gabriella Wilde, which opened to $14.46M for the four-day weekend. Despite terrible reviews and an unknown cast, the romance was the primary option for teenage girls. However, the film was extremely frontloaded, as it made most of its money on Friday with $7.4M.
Way down at No. 7 was the fantasy romance Winter’s Tale, which flopped with a $8M opening. Starring Colin Farrell and Russell Crowe, the directorial debut for Akiva Goldsman, who wrote the screenplays for The Da Vinci Code, A Beautiful Mind and I Am Legend, was never able to clarify what, exactly, the film was about. It never made clear whether it was magic-based, fantasy, supernatural, or spiritual and the story of a man living forever to save the woman he loves got lost in the mix.
It was a robust lovely time at the theater, but updated 1980s flicks and a threesome of romances were no match for the Lego epic.
