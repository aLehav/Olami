Summer has just begun, but there will be no lazy beach days for USC football. This season, the Trojans should be in the hunt for a Pac-12 title that doesn’t have a clear favorite. If USC does make it to the Pac-12 title game, they will likely face either No. 11 Stanford or No. 18 Oregon — the North’s heavyweights.
Loaded with five Preseason All-Americans, USC definitely has the talent to win the conference as no other Pac-12 team has more than three based on Phil Steele’s 2016 Preseason All-American Team.
Junior wideout JuJu Smith-Schuster is a first team pick and Biletnikoff Award favorite. Smith-Schuster finished last season with 89 catches for 1,454 yards and 10 TDs (all team bests). He was named one of 10 Biletnikoff Award semifinalists in 2015, and he earned second-team All American honors and made the All-Pac-12 first team. His 2015 campaign was slowed by a wrist-break midway through the year versus California. Although he never missed a game, Smith-Schuster only posted one 100-plus game after the injury. In 2016, the sky’s the limit for a healthy JuJu.
Three Trojans — Zach Banner, Adoree’ Jackson, and Zach Smith — made the second team. Banner, a fifth-year senior, started all 14 games for USC in 2015 — 12 times at right tackle and twice at left tackle. CollegeSportsMadness.com named him a third-team All-American and to the All-Pac-12 first team. The Associated Press and Phil Steele named Banner All-Pac-12 second team. Jackson, a rising junior will focus less on offense next year to improve at cornerback. He is USC’s only player to be named a preseason All-American at two positions — cornerback and punt returner. Smith, a three-year starter, will return for his senior year at long snapper.
USC’s fifth preseason All-American, linebacker Cam Smith, was named to the third team. Smith, a rising sophomore, made Phil Steele’s All-Pac-12 second team last year despite missing USC’s final four games with a knee injury suffered versus Colorado. Through ten games, Smith led the Trojans in tackles (78) and interceptions (3). His healthy performance in 2016 is critical to the Trojans defense.
In addition to these five men, Phil Steele named 10 Trojans to his Preseason Pac-12 Team (fifteen in total). Junior guard Damien Mama joins Banner and Smith-Schuster as first team selection on offense, while Cameron Smith and Jackson made first team defense, and Jackson and Zack Smith first team special teams.
Senior running back Justin Davis and sophomore Ronald Jones II both made preseason All-Pac-12. According to Phil Steele, Davis is a second-team selection and Jones third-team. In 2015, Jones was a Phil Steele All-Pac-12 third-team selection. Davis started eight games, running for 902 yards and averaging 5.3 per carry with seven TDs including two in the Holiday Bowl versus Wisconsin. His three biggest rushing performances came in three consecutive games versus ranked opponents – Oregon (141 yards), UCLA (130), and Stanford (99).
Offensive linemen junior Toa Lobendahn and redshirt senior Chad Wheeler each nabbed second-team honors according to Athlon. Lobendahn missed half of last year with a knee injury and Wheeler had off-field issues later in the season, though he earned Phil Steele’s third team All-Pac-12 honors last year. The two of them will return to lead a veteran O-line that Phil Steele ranks first in the Pac-12.
Redshirt junior Max Browne, a first-time starter in 2016, rounds out Southern California’s offensive preseason All-Pac-12 selections with Phil Steele’s fourth-team honors. A lot will be riding on his shoulders when the Trojans open the season versus defending NCAA champions Alabama.
The Trojans do not have a shortage of talent on the other side of the ball. Phil Steele named six defensive Trojans to his preseason All-Pac-12 team. Jackson and Cameron Smith lead on the first team, followed by sophomores cornerback Iman Marshall on second, defensive back Marvell Tell III on third, and linebacker Osa Masina and defensive tackle Rasheem Green on fourth. USC’s young defensive backs will return in 2016 with experience, maturity and an Adoree’ Jackson who will not have to split practice time with the offense.
While USC does not kick off its 2016 campaign until September, the summer is abuzz with talk of Trojan football. With Clay Helton settled in as head coach, USC’s young stars should have the proper tutelage to blossom into All-Pac-12 performers in 2016.

With the NBA Draft taking place on Thursday, the Trojans have two players who hope to take the next step and play in the NBA.
Guard Julian Jacobs and forward Nikola Jovanovic will forego their final years of eligibility and pursue a spot on a professional roster, though both appear to be late second round selections at best after neither received an invitation to the draft combine last month.
Jacobs averaged 11.6 points, 4.9 rebounds and 5.5 assists last season, starting every game for the Trojans, who will miss his athleticism, defensive prowess and ability to run the offense. As of Sunday, Jacobs, who has worked out with the Indiana Pacers, ranked 94th on DraftExpress’ list of Top 100 Prospects.
Jovanovic appears to be lower on the rung than Jacobs, though he did work out with the Detroit Pistons, according to the Detroit Free Press. The forward averaged 12.1 points and seven rebounds as a starter. A big man who can stretch the floor with his jump shot, Jovanovic’s strengths are well-suited for today’s NBA game.
Jacobs and Jovanovic will hope to become the first Trojans selected in the draft since 2011, when Nikola Vucevic was chosen in the first round by the Philadelphia 76ers.
The draft will be Thursday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, and it will be broadcast on ESPN starting at 4 p.m.

It’s funny how narrative works in sports. Win a championship and you’re a legend. Lose one and you’re a choker.
At least that’s how it is in today’s social media age. Look at LeBron James. He was the ultimate choke artist in Cleveland until he bolted for Miami and became the biggest traitor since Benedict Arnold. He then won two championships and got rid of the “choke artist” title before returning to Cleveland, and on Sunday he became the “hometown hero” once again by leading his Cavaliers to a championship, the city’s first since 1964.
The false narratives have followed James like none other throughout his 13-year career. He’s the next Michael Jordan. He can’t deliver in the clutch. He’ll never win a championship in Cleveland. He needs two superstars around him to win a ring. He’s arrogant, selfish, not a team player, soft, a crybaby and on the wrong side of 30.
And in a span of two weeks, he took all of those scorching hot takes and extinguished them for good with an NBA Finals performance for the ages. With his team down 3-1 in the series, he scored 41 points in back-to-back elimination games and then poured in a triple-double — 27 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists — in a Game 7 win on the road, beating a Warriors team that hadn’t lost three straight games since 2013 and had lost four times at home all season. With the game tied late, his chase down block on Andre Iguodala — taking away a sure layup — that led to Kyrie Irving’s go-ahead 3-pointer is one of the greatest championship-defining moments you will ever see.
In these two weeks, James has taken his legacy and raised it higher than the sky, re-established himself as the best player in the league and shown that the king is not dead — he is very much alive and still doing incredible, non-human, groundbreaking basketball things.
As high as James is flying right now, the Warriors have gone on a free-fall twice the distance. As someone who has followed the Warriors since I knew what basketball was, to see the narrative around this team right now is very conflicting and painful. I will spare you the details of the horrid basketball that I watched growing up, but if you told me before 2012 they would make the playoffs four straight years, much less two consecutive Finals, I would’ve laughed.
But 2015 was the year they burst onto the scene as the cool new toy and this season was supposed to prove they were worthy of legendary status. And everything was going so well. They broke the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls’ regular-season wins record with 73, a feat that may never be touched again.
I was lucky enough to cover one of their games and attend two more as a fan, and it was like the circus coming to town every night. Crowds would gather just to watch Stephen Curry’s pre-game warm-up routine. It was like the intro to the real show, and boy was it a show. The Splash Brothers would celebrate 3-pointers prematurely and you couldn’t do anything about it because they went in. Draymond Green would taunt and trash talk and get under your skin and you couldn’t respond because his team was running circles around yours.
By the end, after 48 minutes of a barrage of 3-pointers and relentless Harlem Globetrotter-like ball movement, the question for a team that started the season 24-0 and set nearly every record in the books was not whether they would win, but how much they would win by. They were arrogant because they could be, and they had everyone convinced they were invincible.
Until they weren’t. Until the Oklahoma City Thunder had them down 3-1 in the conference finals and it took Klay Thompson’s heroics to raise them back from the dead. Suddenly, they were beatable. And then, inexplicably, they blew a 3-1 series lead in the Finals, the first team ever to do so. Quite literally, the Warriors are the best team in NBA history to not win a championship, a dubious honor that just screams, “choke artists.”
And with it come all the narratives, true or untrue. The Warriors are so overrated. Biggest choke job ever. Last season was a fluke. Curry is soft, weak and undeserving of a unanimous MVP award. Winning 73 games means nothing. Charles Barkley was right: jump-shooting teams can’t win.
I could go on — Twitter experts are great. But the bottom line is that narratives are dumb. If James doesn’t block that layup and if Irving misses that 3-pointer, we’re talking about how James is still a choker and will never end Cleveland’s championship curse and dubbing the Warriors as the greatest team of all time.
It is entirely possible to believe that the Warriors had an incredible season while James played out of his mind and the Cavs pulled off an upset for the ages. But that would be too logical for social media, where takes must be made instantly and James fluctuates between “hero” and “choker” faster than the speed of light. I can’t wait for these two teams to meet again in next year’s Finals and for more narratives to come.

Pat Haden, USC’s outgoing athletic director, reportedly collected millions of dollars and directed millions more to the University while serving as the board chairman of the George Henry Mayr Foundation, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Tax returns from 1999 — the year Haden took over as board chairman — until 2014 indicated that he, his daughter and sister-in-law — both of whom also worked for the foundation — collected about $2.4 million, half of which went to him, the Times reported.
Additionally, the amount of money donated to USC during his tenure is dramatically greater than any other university. According to the Times, USC received $1,764,750 from the Mayr Foundation between 1999 and 2014, more than three times as much as the next highest recipient, St. Mary’s Academy, which received $480,750.
Furthermore, under Haden’s tenure, donations to colleges other than USC dropped about 50 percentage points. As of 2014, USC received 10.5 percent of donation shares while all other colleges received just 11.2 percent combined.
Haden’s daughter Natalie O’Connor has received approximately $470,000 in payments since 2005, mainly for part-time work with the foundation, according to tax records cited in the report.
Haden’s sister-in-law Catherine Grier Olson, who became a member in 2000, has received more than $750,000 as a director of the foundation. According to the Times report, in the 1970s, directors received individual compensation ranging from nothing to $500 annually.
Pat Haden started at the foundation as a paid advisor to the foundation in 1998. His father-in-law, Benjamin F. Grier, served on the board from 1984 until his death in 1999.
The George Henry Mayr Foundation was established in 1949 as a scholarship fund for California schools. Its founder, George Mayr, died in 1958. Mayr’s nephew Ted Mayr also served on the board from its inception until his death in 1976. The board has not had a representative of the Mayr family since then.
“Under no circumstances would Mr. Mayr agree to pay money like that to individuals,” Al Maland, a relative of Mayr, said to the Times regarding Haden and his family members collecting money.
Haden, Olson and O’Connor are allowed to pay themselves “reasonable compensation” with the approval of the trustee Wells Fargo Bank under the terms of the foundation’s trust.
The 63-year-old Haden, who declined to be interviewed in the report, will step down as athletic director on June 30 after six years at the helm. O’Connor and Olson did not respond to interview requests. A USC spokesman told the Times that Haden has also stepped down as chairman of the foundation but will remain as a volunteer board member.
You would think Haden would be above all that as a Rhodes Scholar. He was hired as AD to be a stabilizing figure for
the athletic dept. during the sanctions. It turns out he is the one that needs to be sanctioned. His accomplishments at
USC outside of fund raising has been less than mediocre with coaches in all sports.
Pat Haden has been useless as an athletic director besides fundraising.  His selection of football coaches were a joke and nothing else.
That’s such a sad ending for the Haden legacy at USC… mired in corruption and theft.
I’m no fan of Pat Haden and his actions, but in all fairness, this wasn’t “corruption and theft”.   Corruption and theft imply illegal activities and there’s nothing in the report that I see involved anything that was technically illegal.   Unethical, yes.  But not criminal.

Los Angeles has been awarded a bid to host the International Society for Stem Cell Research  conference in 2019.
The conference will be co-hosted by USC Stem Cell with financial support from the Hong Kong-based Choi family, in partnership with the ISSCR, and will be held at the Los Angeles Convention Center in downtown L.A. Holding the conference in Los Angeles is indicative of the region’s rising biotechnology industry and USC’s growing role in southern California biotechnology.
“We are extremely excited to welcome the International Society for Stem Cell Research to Los Angeles for the first time ever and look forward to their 17th annual meeting in 2019,” said L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti in a press release. “L.A. is the latest and most innovative bioscience hotspot in the state, and ISSCR’s choice is a reflection of the scientific advances occurring in our city today.”
Chairman of the executive committee of USC Stem Cell Andy McMahon  expressed his gratitude to key players in bringing the ISSCR conference to Los Angeles.
“I would like to acknowledge the key role of Mayor Eric Garcetti’s office and the Choi family in our successful bid to put L.A. on the major science meeting circuit,” McMahon said in a press release. “We are delighted to extend our warmest welcome to the wide range of visionaries and leaders who will be attending this event, which will be a great opportunity to highlight research at USC and our sister institutions across the region.”
The conference will attract leading stem cell researchers from the international community and will encourage new ideas from the brightest scientific minds working today that has the potential to benefit not only stem cell research, but regenerative medicine and public health at large.
The ISSCR conference has previously been hosted by Barcelona, Boston, San Francisco, Stockholm, Toronto, Vancouver, Yokohama and Philadelphia. Eli Broad, who with his wife has funded three stem cell centers at USC, UCLA and the University of California, San Francisco, said Los Angeles’ stature as host city to this international conference will shine a light on the work of stem cell researchers being done in California.
“California has become the world leader in stem cell research, with some of the most promising research being conducted in Los Angeles,” Broad said in a press release.
ISSCR CEO Nancy Witty said the announcement of Los Angeles hosting the 2019 conference was met with enthusiasm from “the local government, the biotech industry and the scientific and health communities.” Witty is also looking forward to the co-sponsor relationship with USC Stem Cell and their “world-class scientists.”
The 2019 conference is expected to bring together nearly 100 research and clinical faculty members working with USC Stem Cell, L.A.-area investigators and over 4,000 stem cell scientists.
UC Irvine professor and director of UCI’s Sue and Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center, Peter Donovan, noted the potential benefits to having the ISSCR conference held in Los Angeles.
“The attention brought to the city by this conference should send a strong message to the biotech community that L.A. and So Cal is the place for regenerative medicine and that, in addition to helping patients and their families, the work being carried out here can be an economic powerhouse for the city and region,” Donovan said in a press release.

Local school district Lawndale Elementary School District, just southeast of the Los Angeles International Airport, has partnered with the USC School of Social Work to provide a Social Work Intern Program for master’s students at universities in the region.
Initiated in the fall of 2013 by Director of Student Support Services Jorge Arroyo and District Social Worker Maria Ruelas, the program is now in its third year and is proving to be mutually beneficial to USC and other universities’ master’s students seeking job experience in the social work field, as well as to the elementary school students who need counseling and other services. In fact, LESD was recently recognized by USC School of Social Work faculty as “Agency of the Year” for the assistance they provide for young schoolchildren and the real-life career training they provide for university students seeking experience in the field.
“Receiving the USC School of Social Work Agency of the Year Award is a true testament to our hard work and dedication to provide high quality and enriching experiences for graduate-level interns,” Ruelas said.
In just three years since the program’s institution, LESD now hosts eight school site social workers and more than 10 community mental health agencies as part of their Student Support Services program.  Focusing on individual counseling, group counseling and parent workshops in the fields of health, attendance and behavior interventions, LESD social workers and social work interns have proved themselves to be invaluable to the students they serve. Besides their reception of awards like USC School of Social Work’s Agency of the Year award, LESD Intern Program’s success is also evident in areas like mental health. For example, the counseling, workshops and other preventative measures practiced in the program have reduced waitlists to mental health providers in the Lawndale community and have reduced behavioral issues inside and outside the classroom.
Beginning with only eight interns in the 2013-2014 academic year, LESD currently hosts 56 interns from USC and other local universities like Loyola Marymount University, Cal State Long Beach, California State University, Dominguez Hills and California State University Fullerton, among others. These interns currently help service around 200 elementary school students and families in the district. These future social workers are helping to expand community access to mental health for children and giving back to the local community through their honorable service.
“Although we have grown rather quickly, we have not compromised the quality of our program and this is what sets us apart,” Ruelas said. “We invest in our interns in hopes that they not only impact the Lawndale community but also the social work profession at large.”
Recent USC master’s student alumna Sylvia Ukwu interned at LESD for two years and was thankful for the experience she received.
“I gained experience in micro, mezzo, and macro levels, making me a confident social worker. It was a challenging internship placement but I came out learning so much about myself and the social work profession,” Ukwu said.
Since the program’s inception, LESD has “been able to more effectively meet the social, emotional, behavioral and overall basic needs of students” by expanding access to group and individual counseling, helping to improve attendance rates and engaging parents in the education process, ensuring a better future for their young students, according to a press release issued by LESD.

While season three begins to touch on the complexities of life in a privatized prison, season four of Orange is the New Black delves deep into societal and personal issues of the prisoners of Litchfield.
Typically categorized as a comedy-drama series, season four has only a few brief moments of laughter. Though the series has been unable to compete as a comedy in the past at the Emmys, season four truly gives the drama designation merit.
However, there is no genre debate this time around, as creator Jenji Kohan has given life to the most gripping, painful and emotionally exhaustive season yet. That is not to say that past seasons did not have moments of tragedy or despair, but speaks to how tense and dire the situation has become for the prisoners of Litchfield.
Season four seems to be business as usual for Joe Caputo as he clumsily stumbles to navigate his new corporate role with MCC, as the day-to day-operations are delegated to a new captain of the corrections officers, Desi Piscatella. While Caputo is off juggling what MCC determines is best for themselves and what he feels is morally right, Piscatella and his team of guards run the prison with an iron fist.
Though it is initially implied that Piscatella means well and has the prison in his best interest, it’s quickly shown he is willing to go to the extremes as a means of ensuring order. These extremes often involve systematic racism, codes of silence, torture and sexual assault — all of which are major topics of conversation in the real world.
Meanwhile, Piper looks to push her power and influence further through the means of attempted intimidation and bribery. To no avail, Piper looks to new networks of inmates to help her build her empire. However, much to the discomfort and horror of the other inmates, this new empire forms into something Piper couldn’t foresee. The formation of this new social circle has major implications for not only Piper, but also for the entire prison.
Though season three touches on the disadvantages of privatized prisons, season four illustrates the corruption of MCC, the private company that took over operations at the prison. A large number of new inmates are transferred into the already-crowded Litchfield Penitentiary in an effort to maximize profits. The phrase from the show’s theme song “trapped, trapped, trapped ‘till the cage is full” shows an accurate portrayal of where the prison is moving. A majority of the transfers are Latina, shifting power relations upon their arrival and affecting racial tensions for the others.
A new face that only further adds to the racial tensions is the character Judy King, a seemingly “Martha Stewart-esque” character that has been convicted of tax evasion. To put it lightly, Judy is treated differently from the general population – and this only further perpetuates the racial tensions at Litchfield. Despite the issues of race and classism that are well-illustrated, Judy King is more than a caricature — she becomes a bridge between the guards and prisoners, both of whom she creates alliances with.
Though every character has relevance and depth, at this point of the series not all are able to have their own narratives centralized. It’s really a shame as the dialogue among the prisoners and the guards has always been a brilliant part of the series. Despite unrivaled character banter among other television series, the brief moments of relief often only lead to further tension, anger and violence despite originating from kernels of comedy.
The tension and imbalance between the prisoners and the guards has always been a major theme of the show, but in season four, a death, and how it’s dealt with, demonstrate how volatile Litchfield has truly become. The situation in no way gets resolved by the end, but rather, intensifies. Audiences will surely be satisfied with season four, but will without a doubt anxiously await the release of season five and long for the closure that lacked this season.

Birdies is Chef Jason Harley’s newest creation — a restaurant that unites two favorite comfort foods: donuts and fried chicken. Like many trendy DTLA eats, Birdies is small and inconspicuous, nestled on the intersection of Midway Place and Olympic Boulevard.
Walking into Birdies however, is a completely different experience. The site of multicolored, artisanal donuts behind glass casing captures the eyes of customers immediately, and the stylish, old-school menus along with a cluster of filament light bulbs create a simplistic, tasteful backdrop for the show-stealing desserts. But what really shines, literally and figuratively, is a single 24-karat gold leaf donut sitting in its own glass dome.
Luckily Birdies’ Instagram-worthy donuts are not all $100 and plated in gold. They include flavors such as Strawberry Shortcake, Lemon Thyme Pistachio, Candied Maple Bacon and Cinnamon Nut Crunch. It’s difficult choosing just one donut, since each flavor looks equally as indulgent and decadent as the next. What makes Birdies unique is that its staff allows customers to sample each flavor before making a decision.
Among the donuts sampled, the Strawberry Shortcake donut wins with its classic flavor and charming presentation. This yeast-raised donut is glazed with white frosting and dark chocolate zebra stripes, topped with a single red strawberry. Sandwiched between the two halves is a decadent layer of buttercream mixed with sliced strawberries. Though this donut’s appearance screams “glutton,” the buttercream’s lightness complemented the strawberries well, which makes it the overall winner of Birdies’ donut selections.
For any Oreo lovers, the Cookies and Cream donut is highly recommended. Similar to the Strawberry Shortcake donut, it too contains a light, fluffy layer of cream. Decorating the top is a thick layer of white glaze and chunks of Oreo cookie that add a crunchy texture and the signature Oreo taste to the donut.
Also sampled was the Candied Bacon Maple, which was a bit more on the sweet side than savory. Nonetheless, it did not disappoint. The bacon bits sprinkled on top of a cream-colored glaze added a much-needed savoriness that is unique to bacon maple donuts.
Perhaps the most eye-catching dessert on the rack, however, is the Lemon Thyme Pistachio, a cake donut, which boasts a vibrant green glaze sprinkled with pieces of pistachio. Despite the unusual color and zesty name, the donut turned out to be quite underwhelming. The flavor was too subtle; aside from the pistachios and a hint of lemon, this donut may have just been your average Joe.
Beyond its wide array of donut selections, Birdies offers three types of fried chicken sandwiches as well as an assortment of chicken wings, breasts, legs and thighs. The sandwiches are a bit expensive for their compact size, ranging between $8-$10, but the slab of fried chicken breast stuck between two brioche buns is definitely no snack. The Birdies Spicy sandwich contains, in addition to the fried chicken breast, coleslaw, ghost pepper mayo, Tillamook pepper jack and cured pickles. The ghost pepper mayo added a kick to the sandwich, making the Birdies Original a more viable option for those who are sensitive to spice, but is otherwise very similar to the original. The only criticism for the sandwich is the ratio between the thick chicken breast to the leafy cole slaw, which was barely there, and made the sandwich slightly dry.
Surprisingly, the cheapest sandwich on the menu, the Birdies Breakfast Sandwich, was one of the best items. The sandwich contains an over easy or scrambled egg combined with fried chicken tender, apple wood smoked bacon and Tillamook cheddar accompanied with Birdies special sauce on the side. The caramelized onions added sweet, savory and umami flavors in the sandwich and ultimately made it a truly mouth-watering dish.
Though the menu at Birdies may seem artery-clogging, people will be glad to know that the restaurant capitalizes on using fresh and natural ingredients. The chickens used are antibiotic-free free range, and the donuts are made fresh every hour with “locally sourced ingredients.” Finally, Birdies’ helpful staff created a pleasant and friendly atmosphere, welcoming customers from the moment they walked in until the moment they walked out. Birdies is a must-try for any donut and breakfast food lovers in L.A.

Comedian Louis C.K.’s newest show, Horace and Pete, has been taking over the internet. Deadline recently hosted an exclusive screening series called Awardsline, which featured screenings of many popular films and television series as well as Q&As with key people from the productions. Deadline showed C.K.’s Horace and Pete last Wednesday at the Landmark Theatre in West Los Angeles with a post-screening discussion about the show with Louis C.K. himself, which was open to USC students and Deadline members alike.
Horace and Pete tells the story of two brothers named Horace and Pete, played by Louis C.K. and Steve Buscemi, running a family-owned bar, Horace and Pete’s, in Brooklyn. The series follows the two characters through their ups and downs, and discusses issues of love, marriage, family, current events and more. Featuring an all-star cast that includes Edie Falco, Jessica Lange, Kurt Metzger, Rebecca Hall, Steven Wright and others, the show premiered in February but did not gain much attention until now. Louis C.K. was very adamant about not wanting to reveal any details about the episodes until they aired in order to keep the story new and interesting.
“I didn’t want it to matter if the show hit or not. The main reason I did it this way was for dramatic effect, for the story,” C.K. said at the screening.
The screening featured episodes one and three of the series, which were completely different from each other in format and structure. Episode 1 is formatted like a play, with a more traditional plot, introducing the characters and explaining the history of Horace and Pete’s. In contrast, Episode 3 begins with a 10-minute monologue by Laurie Metcalf and continues with more conversation for almost the full episode. Although this approach of just using tight angles and monologues is unconventional, the show pulls it off mainly because of the thoughtful writing and stunning performances by Metcalf and C.K. These different styles work together masterfully because of the cohesive writing that taps into many vulnerabilities of the character, which is something most comedies won’t touch. This is done in a way that doesn’t feel uncomfortable, but instead impressively relatable.
The series was shot as a live show, with two to three takes of the full performances from four cameras. Production of each episode ran from Monday to Friday of each week to keep the writing relevant to current events. The episodes were released on Saturday mornings online and quickly picked up steam as the season went on.
The show has been submitted for the Emmy drama category and marks an interesting time for changing media platforms. Despite the praise that it has received, Louis C.K. revealed to fans that he will not be producing a second season of the show. However, an Emmy win could really change things. Until then, Horace and Pete can be streamed online from Louis C.K.’s website.

Last week, the city of London declared that advertisements that “could reasonably be seen as likely to cause pressure to conform to an unrealistic or unhealthy body shape” would be banned from appearing in public transportation vehicles or stations. At issue was an advertisement for Protein World, a manufacturer of weight-loss and muscle-gain dietary supplements, featuring an athletically-built young woman in a bikini. The advertisement read “Are you beach body ready?” Evidently, London was not.
London’s successful ban of images that merely could cause an individual discomfort is disturbing for those concerned with freedom of expression. Its new municipal government felt that such an ad was inappropriate for an audience to be exposed to at all. Had the advertisement been deliberately demeaning or explicitly derogatory in its language, the apparent outrage would have been more justified. This, however, was not the case. The advertisement’s model and presentation could best be described as typical, similar to innumerable ads run for various products all over the world. Calling for change in the modeling industry to reflect the composition of society at large is one thing, but manipulating the law to force companies to conform to one’s belief about how one should look is quite another.
Judging from the online petition calling for the advertisement’s removal, which garnered over 70,000 signatures, a number of people were quite upset at the mere existence of the ad. Perhaps rightly so — achieving a more-or-less idealized figure is an immensely difficult task for many, this writer included. However, it was very irresponsible for the city of London to ban the advertisement and all those like it on the basis of its use of an assumedly unhealthy model. The model, Renee Somerfield, is a self-proclaimed vegan, has a healthy BMI and has worked hard to achieve her appearance in the ad. Clearly the issue is not that the model was unhealthy or attempting to promote unhealthy lifestyles. It is more likely that some riders on London’s public transit system felt like they were not represented by the advertisement, and felt indignation as a result. If consumers believe that they are not represented by an ad and want more people who look like them to be featured, there is a simpler, more respectful and more effective way to effect that change instead of demanding that the government ban the promotion of other body types.
Like countless advertised products, weight loss supplements attract consumer interest by presenting their audience with something it may not have. In this case, that is an athletically toned body. It is then up to the consumer to decide if they want to purchase the product. There is no coercion involved because the choice to purchase is entirely voluntary. If people are offended by an advertisement, they are most likely not purchasing what it is selling. If Protein World missed the mark and advertised to the wrong demographic, it would not see a return on its advertisement campaign investment. That would send a message to Protein World — wrong place, wrong time. Protein World would then move the ads from London’s public transit system to more profitable pastures, freeing the riders from what some may feel are offensive ads.
The success of this market-based approach to body image and modeling can be seen especially in the American consumer base — models like Ruby Rose, Madeline Stuart and Tess Holliday have garnered significant positive attention in the United States and from consumers and companies alike. Rose, an Australian queer model and actress, has enjoyed considerable success and acclaim on Netflix’s Orange Is the New Black. Stuart, an Australian model with Down syndrome, has been featured in People Magazine in recognition of her breakthrough modeling and designing career. Holliday is an American plus-size model who has been featured in People Magazine and Vogue Italia and was the first woman of her body type to sign a contract with a well-known modeling agency. These individuals did not become famous because of beauty standards — they became famous in spite of them. It was not government censorship, but the desire to express themselves that helped drive their continuing success.
No one, skinny and tall or chubby and short, should be told their body type and appearance are damaging to others, and especially not as a matter of law.  Blatant proscription of any body type in media is discriminatory and harmful in and of itself. The act of supporting or being in favor of London’s recent advertisement ban, despite it claiming to be promoting unhealthy body image, would be antithetical to freedom of expression and the respect for all body types. A model is a model, and they should be free to present themself to whomever they wish through through whatever platform they see fit. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and the regulation of beauty has no place in a society that values freedom of expression.
Yes, London’s ban, as described, is silly and unjustified.  It represents another over-correction to a debatable problem in the first place.  It ascribes way too much consideration for the “feelings” of individuals, based on a questionable premise, and presents an unjustified constraint on corporate advertising.
There is increasing conversation on this and related topics here in the United States, and quite frankly it is largely ridiculous and certainly contradictory.  On one hand you have medical professionals, scientists and even the First Lady telling us that obesity is a major problem in the U.S.  Indeed they are correct.  Yet at the same time, we have other people, often politically motivated, attacking companies like Mattel suggesting that the Barbie doll presents an unrealistic image, or that it will cause young people to be depressed or otherwise negatively affected.  Really??  Clearly this is not true because if things like Barbie dolls and fashion models were having such a huge negative impact on people in our society, then there wouldn’t be such an obesity problem.  Yes, some people suffer eating disorders and other issues because of society’s pressure to be thin… but the vast majority of people respond to this pressure in a sensible and healthy way.
The point is that this sort of pressure is a good thing.  We clearly need to be encouraging people to stay fit, healthy and active… and for those who are carrying extra weight beyond what science and medicine tell us is healthy, to work at losing that weight.  This is good pressure.  We can’t have it both ways.  If people feel an element of shame for being overweight, this is good.  These are natural, healthy responses… They are an expression of conscience.
Also, let’s please correct some more nonsense about the modeling industry.  These same people who take issue with the Barbie Doll have also been attacking the modeling and fashion industries for not “reflecting society”.  Total rubbish.  The modeling industry was NEVER about reflecting society.  Models by definition reflect “ideals”.  Models generally represent what people would like to be or achieve.  Models are not meant to be average.  They are above-average.  They present a form of escape for the rest of us average people.  If we start pressuring the modeling industry into adding fat people or Downs Syndrome people or people in wheelchairs… then we would cease to have modeling.  Instead we would simply have normal, everyday people.  There’s absolutely no shame in being a normal, everyday person… but then you are not a model.  That’s not what fashion and modeling is about.  This is another screwball effort by so-called “Progressives” to push for inclusion or equality.  STOP.  Not everybody gets to be included in everything.  That’s not how anything works, and you are teaching young people the wrong message to suggest the everyone gets included… or that everyone is beautiful.
Time for a reality check.  
This stance regarding public marketing was announced by the newly installed mayor of London who happens to be Muslim. Not saying there is any linkage, just reporting, you decide.
