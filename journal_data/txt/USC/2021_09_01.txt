On Tuesday, the Undergraduate Student Government discussed their plans for hybrid learning options and campus accessibility at their second meeting of the 2021-22 school year.
During her presentation, Vice President Lucy Warren shared that USG pushed for online hybrid learning at “every admin meeting” that they attended over the summer.
According to Warren, the University offered only 30 online courses prior to the pandemic, but the University now offers over 160. 
“In meetings with the Provost we’ve had over the summer and in meetings with VP [for Student Affairs Winston] Crisp, we have expressed that students do want greater online and hybrid options,” Warren said. “They’ve reiterated their policy that they allowed each school to make that decision independently, but reinforced the idea that [USC is] offering much greater online classes than have ever been offered before.”
Warren said that USG intends to keep asking the Provost’s office to expand remote learning options for students, and that if students don’t feel comfortable attending their classes in-person, they can request a note-taker from the Office of Student Accessibility Services to attend their lectures for them. 
Warren, along with Chief Diversity Officer Kavita Rai, also shared an update on USG’s recent work aiming to investigate the school’s compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Warren detailed plans to create an ADA Non-Compliance Reporting Form for students as well as an accessibility-themed scavenger hunt on University Park Campus and Health Sciences Campus to “get all the students out to go around and find what is inaccessible on campus.” 
“Right now, students have no way to report when things are inaccessible. That’s problematic,” Warren said. “Ultimately, all of these projects are working towards creating an accessibility cultural center for students, so we can actually have a cultural space for students who are disabled.” 
Rai reviewed the “USG Accessibility Handbook” that she started authoring over the summer and aims to improve how “accessibility is understood throughout USG.” Rai said that she and the other members of the USG Advocacy Department are collaborating with the Peer Education Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Program and consulting the policies of comparable universities to create the document. 
During the meeting, members of the Senate also discussed numerous proposals intended to promote environmental appreciation and sustainability on campus. 
Speaker of the Senate Ruben Romeo recapped his efforts to access a $500 micro-grant to incorporate biophilic interior design, which would mean decorating the USG office with plants and nature-centric imagery. 
“[The biophilic design] will just help to make the area feel a little more refresh[ing] and calm because these kinds of settings are very stressful on the student mind and body and psychology,” Romeo said. 
Sen. Russell Agustin introduced a similar idea, proposing a community garden project with the Sustainability and Campus Infrastructure Committee, in addition to a meat alternatives campaign intended to “eliminate toxic veganism” while also “promoting more meat alternatives” available to students.  
Agustin hopes to start the campaign by hosting a discussion designed to address controversial issues related to dietary preferences. 
“In my presentation, I talked about promoting meat alternatives … and promoting acceptance for all diets on campus. I think, you know, it’s been something that’s been worked upon in previous years, though, I just want to be able to be a contributing effort to promote that via social media and a discussion,” Agustin said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
 Agustin also said he wants to collaborate with youth from the surrounding area to “promote civic innovation within communities.” 
This summer, Agustin served as the youth lead for a project called Tilt — an operation run by “the [United Nations’ Sustainable Development] guild to promote the 17 sustainable development goals,” and Ashoka, a network of social entrepreneurs. According to Agustin, his team ultimately helped over 50 high schoolers in Brazil launch their own advocacy programs. 
“Using that same model, I’m hoping that I can bring that to communities in L.A.,” Agustin said. “It’s through youth leadership that we can accomplish real social impact.” 
At the end of the meeting, Rai introduced the new advocacy liaisons, who will work under USG’s newly created advocacy branch. The new liaisons are Mythili Iyer, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science and health and human sciences, who will represent the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, and Timothy Wang, a senior majoring in occupational therapy, who will represent the Student Assembly for Accessibility. The liaisons will be confirmed at next week’s meeting. 
Correction: A previous version of this article accidentally referred to the Sustainability and Campus Infrastructure Committee as the Safe Communities Institute. A previous version of this article accidentally didn’t mention Tilt’s other founder, Ashoka. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The day before returning to campus, Parker Weiss, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering, tested positive for the coronavirus. Weiss, who was fully vaccinated and completely asymptomatic, only tested because of USC’s policy that students should receive a coronavirus test within three days of returning to campus. 
While Weiss said the testing process should be “streamlined,” he is supportive of the policy because he would have never known that he was positive without the requirement.
“[The testing policy] does catch those cases that were like mine. I could have given it to a bunch of people,” Weiss said. “I didn’t really know. I thought I felt fine. It’s a good idea.”
For the first time since March 2020, students returned to in-person classes last week, skating down Trousdale, filling out Trojan Check and waiting in long lines for coronavirus tests. In interviews with the Daily Trojan, students expressed varying opinions on the University’s masking and testing requirements, a hybrid option and the contrast between coronavirus regulations and some Welcome Week events.
Weiss missed most of Welcome Week because he was in quarantine, but he criticized the “discrepancy” between strict USC housing rules and relaxed Welcome Week coronavirus policies. 
“In on-campus housing, you can’t have anybody from outside of your apartment even just visit, not even one person,” Weiss said. “But then, for Welcome Week they threw mosh pit events where kids aren’t wearing masks.” 
Casius Palacio, a freshman majoring in architecture, also expressed concerns about packed Welcome Week events where people didn’t have their masks on.
“I was very cautious with those events, regardless if everyone’s vaccinated [there]. There’s still a virus and there’s also the Delta variant,” Palacio said. “What I would do is that I would line up early, I would get in early, get all the free stuff, check it out, see if I want to stay and then just leave early before we get the huge crowds.” 
Palacio said with a course schedule “packed to the brim,” walking across campus and waiting in a long line to complete the testing requirement has been frustrating, especially with a mask.
“You would think that once you’re vaccinated, that’s it,” Palacio said. “I gotta walk all across campus to drop off my test and then the lines are kind of long … and it’s hot outside with my mask on, so it’s just frustrating.”
Zoe McCracken, a sophomore majoring in technical direction in the School of Dramatic Arts, said she appreciated the efforts of administration and faculty to keep everyone safe while resuming in-person classes, though masks have posed challenges to rehearsals. 
“In some performance-based classes … because a huge part of performing is emotion and facial expressions, it’s been difficult to try and kind of find new ways to tell a story, taking that element away or just adjusting it,” she said. 
McCracken also wants more consistent enforcement of outdoor masking, where the guidance has been unclear, she said.
“Eating is one thing but walking around campus without a mask is another … so there’s been some times where I question, ‘Is it OK to do that?,’ or ‘Is it not OK? And people are just choosing not to, but there’s not really an enforcement,” McCracken said. 
Masking is only required outdoors at large events, according to a Aug. 26 student health media briefing. 
For Chloe Duckworth, a junior majoring in computational neuroscience, the lack of mask wearing and improper masking has caused her anxiety. 
“While I was excited to see my friends again and have some sense of normalcy, this week made me very anxious, being in these tiny classrooms with no social distancing,” Duckworth said. “A lot of students were not wearing masks or were not wearing masks properly throughout campus, whether it be in classrooms or even just out and about traveling in large outside groups or in other buildings.”
While her professors have been enforcing coronavirus guidelines, Ivy Li, a freshman majoring in political science, has already been notified of being exposed to the virus in class.
“I feel like these things can’t be helped,” Li said. “Especially amongst the freshmen, and even maybe the sophomores, after being locked up for a while, you are going to want to go out.”
In the event of needing to quarantine, Li said she feels prepared to do so, as most of her professors record lectures and she is able to revisit any class material she would have to miss.
For Duckworth, some of her classes are allowing students to “become hybrid at any point in the semester,” and to attend class remotely if they begin feeling sick or uncomfortable. She said she wishes there were a “mandatory hybrid option,” meaning that every class would be required to have an online option for students. 
“I definitely want the University to respond promptly if we do need to shut down again, but in the interim, I think having that mandatory hybrid option for all classes would make a huge difference in the lives of so many students that, like me, are feeling really nervous about being in these crammed classrooms but are not necessarily allowed to not come to class unless you have a [coronavirus] infection that’s current,” Duckworth said. 
Li’s French-language class is currently set up in a hybrid format, with classes taking place two days over Zoom and two days in-person every week. This format has benefits, Li said, such as the professor being able to clearly hear students practice the language and allowing classmates to see each other without a mask.
As the University continues to balance the needs of people with concerns about coronavirus, people who want in-person classes and to meet up with friends amid ever-changing pandemic conditions, students continue to face uncertainties in the upcoming semester.
“Being able to see [my classmates’] faces without a mask is a little refreshing at times,” Li said. “Granted, I would rather be just all in-person with no masks, but given the current circumstances, I think I’ll take what I can get.”

If you’re a freshman worried about purchasing your own groceries for the first time or you’re like me, a junior who still doesn’t really know how to cook, you’ve come to the right place.
With an entire Instagram account dedicated to tracking how long the line is at USC’s very own Trader Joe’s, it’s safe to say that the grocery store is popular among students. On any given day, the line is often wrapped around aisles, sometimes spilling outside if it’s really crowded.
So, how can you make your time count during your next grocery run? Peruse the list below and see if anything catches your eye, or just trust me. 
Mochi
In the frozen aisle, amid a sea of desserts, is row after row of mochi. For those unfamiliar with it, mochi is a Japanese dessert with ice cream wrapped in rice dough and flour. Even though every flavor is great, the strawberry and matcha flavors stand out among the rest. As a self-proclaimed Trader Joe’s fanatic, I’m going to ask you to trust me and look for the pink and green boxes; you’ll thank me later. 
Cinnamon Schoolbook Cookies
It’s the second week of school. If you’re already overwhelmed and remembering simpler times, head to the same frozen food aisle. Above the refrigerated sections, there are plastic tubs of cookies, crackers and sweets. The Cinnamon Schoolbook Cookies are letter-shaped graham crackers but, like their name suggests they hold an extra touch of cinnamon. The box features a red schoolhouse with a comic sans-esque font that is reminiscent of days full of breaks rather than lectures. 
Rolled Corn Chili and Lime Flavored Tortilla Chips
Calling all Takis lovers! If you’re looking for an alternative to one of your favorite snacks, check out Trader Joe’s Rolled Corn Chili and Lime Flavored Tortilla Chips. Even though the two are remarkably similar, something about the Trader Joe’s option just feels healthier. Maybe it’s the fact that some of the title is written in cursive or the picture of them sitting in a fancy ceramic bowl on the front of the packaging, but there’s something indescribable about these chips that makes it easier to justify eating a whole bag in one sitting.
World’s Puffiest White Cheddar Corn Puffs
Another alternative makes an appearance on this list with Trader Joe’s World’s Puffiest White Cheddar Corn Puffs — a replacement for Pirate’s Booty. The title is a bit of a mouthful, but it’s easy to see what they’re talking about when you try one. Even if you fall asleep during a long night of studying — and I sincerely hope you have not already reached that point in the semester — you can be certain that these will remain fresh. 
Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups
Available in two different sizes from a medium-sized box to a small baggie, the Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups are a crowd favorite. Even if you’re not a dark chocolate person, we’ve got your back. A milk chocolate version is offered as well. You can choose between regular-sized peanut butter cups, or go for the minis. The dark and milk chocolate boxes are found around the pizza section in the frozen aisle, and the smaller bags of dark chocolate peanut butter cups are in the front of the store right before the checkout lanes. 
Vegan Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies
A friend of mine gave me very clear instructions to stress the difference between the Vegan Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookies and the regular Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies. Although their similar paper package can be misleading, she believes the oatmeal version to be superior and that’s the one we’re recommending specifically. But as they say, the world is your oyster (or, perhaps, Trader Joe’s is your oyster) and you can try whichever one you please. Maybe try both! 
Movie Theater Popcorn 
Like its namesake suggests, the Movie Theater Popcorn does include a healthy amount of butter (healthy meaning hefty rather than nutritional) and makes your living room feel like a cinema. It’s great for times when you’re hosting a group or for times when several of your kitchen appliances are broken and you can’t cook … anyone else? Just me?
Gone Berry Crazy and Gone Bananas
I am berry excited about the next items on the list. That pun may have been terrible, but I promise you these frozen snacks are not! Gone Berry Crazy and Gone Bananas are chocolate covered fruit slices found in the frozen food aisle. If you’re craving strawberries, search for the cartoon bunny on the Gone Berry Crazy packaging and look for the cartoon sock monkey if classes have driven you a little bananas. 
Crispy Crunchy Chocolate Chip Cookies
This treat is for people who like their cookies well-done. While some cookies are so soft that they’re closer to cookie dough, the Crispy Crunchy Chocolate Chip Cookies are so crispy and crunchy that they’re more like chips. These bite-sized cookies, found near the Schoolbook Cookies recommended on the list, are perfect for a zip-locked snack on the go, or a quick dessert to share with a group. 
Scandinavian Swimmers
These gummy candies — now also offered in a super sour flavor — are something you don’t want to miss. They’re served in a variety of colors and sea life, including red lobsters and yellow seahorses. Ever wanted to try a huckleberry-flavored dolphin? Pick up a bag of Scandinavian Swimmers and live out your dreams.

USC has begun preparation for its first game of the season Saturday against San Jose State. 
It will be the Trojans’ first game back at a full-capacity Coliseum since the 2019 season due to coronavirus restrictions forcing USC to play without home fans last season. 
Although no on-campus tailgates will be allowed, spirits and energy are still high surrounding the game. 
“To have that normalcy, that fan base I feel like that’s just gonna be the slight edge that a lot of people are missing, but also that gives us a chance to feed off them and they feed off us,” senior transfer running back from University of Texas at Austin Keaontay Ingram said. “The team is excited you can tell by the chemistry, just by us warming up.”
USC’s all-time record against San Jose State is 4-0. However, the last time the Trojans and Spartans met was 2009. 
Head Coach Clay Helton believes the Spartans look strong this year. 
“I think Coach Brennan has done an amazing job in his four-year tenure there,” Helton said. “Winning the Mountain West last year, having an undefeated regular season —. He really has a good team that’s put together.”
One particular strength Helton noted was the Spartans’ graduate senior quarterback Nick Starkel.
“I think Nick [is] doing an amazing job: four touchdowns 400 yards in his opening game,” Helton said. “He’s a Sunday quarterback.” 
Junior quarterback Kedon Slovis enters the season with high expectations after a disappointing sophomore season. It is likely this is Slovis’ last campaign as a Trojan since he will be NFL draft-eligible following this season. 
“I think we’re all pretty confident about what we can achieve.  I   think we are gonna have a pretty balance,” Slovis said. “To me, I think we have all the right pieces this year, so I’m excited to kinda see it actually against other opponents.” 
A huge question going into the San Jose State Game is the depth of USC’s wide receiever group. Outside of junior wide receiver Drake London, the Trojans have a lack of pass-catching experience. Slovis, however, has formed strong relationships with his receievers this summer. 
“We were out here probably every weekday this summer after running or after lifting to some extent,” Slovis said. “Some days we probably got less reps than others, but those days you can kind of talk through certain routes … that’s huge for us.”
Even with the concerns at wide receiver, London seems to be the answer. 
“Last year I saw his leadership pick up and I saw him becoming the guy as we started moving through that season,” Helton said.
The junior was also voted as one of four captains this season. 
“It means the world when your players vote you for somebody at that standard; it’s something really special, and I’m just thankful every day,” London said. “I just gotta come out here and be the guy they need me to be.” 
After a debate over who would be the backup signal-caller behind Slovis, it was officially announced that freshman Jaxson Dart earned the No. 2 spot after beating out freshman Miller Moss. 
“Obviously I was super excited. It was a goal of mine coming in here,” Dart said. “I felt like there was a ton of competition in our room and that made us all better, and it really pushed us. I’m just super grateful to be in the spot that I am, and I’m gonna keep working to keep it and to keep succeeding.”
Another big question coming into the season was who the Trojans’ starting running back would be. Ingram, a transfer from Texas, appears to be the lead back heading into the season-opener. 
“I’m really hoping that [the] running game takes a lot of pressure off of nine,” Helton said. “I think we’re better equipped in the running game now.” 
The Trojans will take on the Spartans Saturday at 2 p.m.

We’re finally back on campus!
Who would’ve thought that, after a year and a half, we would actually return to in-person instruction? 
It’s not as if staying at home really impacted much of my job anyway. I am one of the few lucky sports columnists who still had something to write about during quarantine. After all, video games are designed to be played in the comfort of your home. Even when we’re talking about Twitch, streamers usually stay in their rooms. Usually, that is.
If you’re familiar with Twitch, you probably know what “IRL” streams are. For those who don’t, they’re basically streams where the host is doing something other than playing a video game, usually with an emphasis on real people. 
Because this is such a broad definition, the content of IRL streams tends to be extremely varied. Sometimes, they involve a streamer baking a cake. Other times, the host might perform a really dangerous activity, such as rappelling down a building. Regardless, as long as someone is physically able to do it (and follows Twitch’s terms of service), there’s a good chance someone is out there streaming it.
With more and more people getting fully vaccinated and life slowly getting back to normal, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in IRL streaming, especially when two or more streamers collaborate with each other. And understandably so. 
During the pandemic, Twitch experienced a boom in viewership. This likely means many new viewers started using the platform and developing ties with their favorite streamers during this time. So when there is an opportunity to see their favorite creators in-person, of course fans will be interested. This has led to many meetups and even more overall collaborations over the span of a few months.
While all of this may sound exciting, the reality is that most of these meetups just end up feeling like friends hanging out. That is to say it’s not necessarily bad but also not great content for the viewer either. Sure, it might scratch a particular itch for in-person interaction especially after the pandemic, but once you’ve seen one hangout, you’ve seen them all.
But once in a while, a truly remarkable stream happens that broadens the horizon of IRL content and Twitch in general. In this case, I’m talking about Jerma985’s “Dollhouse” stream.
For those of you who didn’t watch it, the “Dollhouse” stream was a series of three live-streams in which chat “controlled” Jerma in what can only be described as a real-life version of “The Sims.” While Twitch chat controlling the stream is certainly nothing new, what was so interesting about this particular iteration was its overall professionalism. 
Jerma brought together a huge team for behind-the-scenes work, which allowed the entire operation to run similarly to a Hollywood production. Jerma and his team incorporated a Twitch extension that allowed users to modify the house and dictate Jerma’s actions in real-time, discovering a completely new form of content on Twitch.
Unlike other IRL streams that I mentioned earlier, the “Dollhouse” streams were actually planned out, with overarching storylines and entire rehearsals dedicated to getting everything just right. But because the stream was a live production that relied heavily on audience engagement, it also had to account for improvisation. 
The end product was a trio of streams that felt highly polished but still accessible for the average viewer. Naturally, these feelings translated into numbers, with more than 100,000 viewers tuning into the three-part stream.
While other streams have reached similar levels of viewership, this form of engagement is unprecedented on the platform. No one has ever achieved something like Jerma has — incorporating the best features from TV production with qualities unique to live-streaming. 
While it may take a lot of work to produce a piece as tight as the “Dollhouse,” the general formula of planned, live- streamed content still holds up regardless of financial background. After all, it does not take a millionaire to be able to write a story with a beginning, middle and end. 
It does, however, require a writer.
This points to what may become the legacy of such a stream: the overall shift in attitude toward livestreaming as an actually viable and deserving platform to tell compelling stories. 
If more streamers try to follow in the footsteps of Jerma, odds are we will likely see morewell-produced IRL content on the platform, which is bound to turn some eyes in the entertainment industry. Once that happens, it isn’t too far-fetched to imagine a world where people will begin specializing in livestream IRL content. 
Until that happens, though, we’ll just have to wait until the next big IRL stream. Based on the massive success of the “Dollhouse,” it shouldn’t be too far away.

In the age of social media, there are so many ways to get involved in the digital world. From content creation and social management to influencers and digital marketers, the possibilities are endless. All of this culminates at USC Reach, a community of individuals versed in these fields with a deep passion for all things social media.
Reach is USC’s first and only social media club, with members ranging from photographers to digital marketers, videographers, content creators — the list goes on.
 Brianna Seaberg, a lifestyle and travel creator who has held various executive board positions at Reach over the past three years, has been able to grow and evolve her own social media accounts because of the skills she has learned as a member of the club. The organization has helped her realize how important it is to be well-rounded and to start creating content on different social media platforms.
“Anyone [who] is in that creative space and puts their work or personal brand on social media [is welcome to Reach] … We’re a really small, tight-knit, exclusive group, but it works because everybody is so passionate and involved in what they do on social media that it brings us together even more,” said Seaberg, a senior majoring in communication.  
To join the club, prospective members must fill out a short online application and then partake in an interview with executive board members. They are then informed via email whether or not they have been accepted. The overall application process is very straightforward and is open to anyone with a passion for social media, although prior experience in this field is recommended. According to Seaberg, many current members ended up going through this process multiple times, and prospective members should not be discouraged if they are not admitted the first time. 
Each semester, the group hosts various workshops for its members related to topics ranging from professional development to social media skills. These workshops are constantly changing based on the wants and needs of current members.
The group also invites a wide range of guest speakers to speak about their experiences within the media industry. Past speakers have included creative executives from Paramount, Google and TikTok, influencers with millions of followers and Reach alumni.  
“These panels were really impactful for me because I’m more on the content side,” said Reach Director of Outreach Dylan Huey, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “I haven’t really focused too much on the industry side, but it’s super interesting to see the other side of social media — the more corporate side of things.”
Due to the pandemic, Reach was unable to coordinate its typical off-site content creation events and semester retreats for members to collaborate together. This year, they are looking forward to meeting each other in person and resuming their usual activities which can involve shooting content in professional studios or traveling to locations such as Melrose to take pictures.
Katherine Vlamis, who joined Reach as a freshman in 2019 and is now co-president, said these meetups provide special opportunities for members to connect and collaborate on new content.
“It really does feel like you’re just hanging out with your friends and you’re still getting content and everything, so we all leave with something. But it doesn’t feel like clout chasing or anything,” Vlamis said. “It’s really just people hanging out that love making content together.”
Though all these workshops, meetings and events are a major part of this organization, what makes Reach so worthwhile is the close-knit family and sense of community that is created among its members, Huey said. Other members also said with social media being a tumultuous platform to navigate alone, having a supportive group of other content creators and digital marketers behind you can make things a little easier.
“I studied abroad last fall and one thing that I found super interesting was that even at 3 a.m. in the morning, I was so motivated to come to Reach meetings because I love the club so much,” said Head of Social Media Kate Mathew, a sophomore majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation. “We love to see each other, and we’re always happy to hang out and get coffee. Like, we’re more than a club. I feel like it’s more like a family.”
Huey, who had previously lost his passion for social media because of the stress and pressure that comes with maintaining a large social presence, has finally been able to reignite that love through the community at Reach.
“I think that Reach really helped me evolve [in] social media [and where] I want to be [and it also showed] me that I can still be friends with content creators,” Huey said. “Before, I kind of cut off all of my friends who are content creators because I was totally focusing on my education. [After joining Reach], I started to talk to the content creators I knew before and got to meet, reconcile and become friends with them again.”
As the USC Reach community has grown over the years — both in size and reputation — the organization is now looking to expand its reach (for lack of a better word) to other colleges across the country. A couple of members said that there aren’t any social media content creation clubs currently in existence on other college campuses, and many students are interested in starting a chapter of the club at their universities. Seaberg is heading up this initiative and has already helped coordinate the development of Reach chapters at UCLA and Southern Methodist University.
“[About a year ago,] we saw that there was a high interest [from] other universities, especially in Southern California, in what Reach is all about, [so] we thought it would be great to expand,” Seaberg said. “Since we were remote, it was a bit hard to expand but now that we are back in person, I’m going to be reaching out to other universities that would be interested — maybe starting more in California and then expanding outward.”
With so many different opportunities in social media and the digital market, it’s no surprise that there is a growing interest in this distinctive community, Seaberg said. As Reach continues to make its way onto other campuses, its members hope that the collaborative, supportive and creative aspects of the club won’t lose their ardor. After all, that’s what makes Reach such an impactful organization.
“We don’t want to limit ourselves to just one type of university or one type of audience. Because you know, everyone’s on social media now, especially after the pandemic — maybe there’s even more of a need for it,” Vlamis said. “We really want people [who] are passionate about different aspects of social media and want to do it to kind of create their own community and help people through the content that they share, not just like the fame.”

When the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization to the Pfizer-BioNtech coronavirus vaccine back in December 2020, it seemed as if the end of the pandemic was on the horizon. Almost nine months and full FDA approval later, the end seems further away than before. 
Vaccination rates have plateaued since June 2021. Currently, only 52.6% of the country is fully vaccinated. This subpar rate is not due to a lack of supply or logistical execution. It is due to a tirade of misinformation. Fake news and pseudoscience have built a stronghold into the minds of too many Americans. Instead of trusting accredited scientists, individuals drift through Facebook-driven conspiracy theories and call it “doing their own research.” 
Unfortunately, this paradigm is far from unfamiliar and continues to repeat itself because of a broken education system. When less than 3% of federal spending accounts for education, the result is millions of Americans struggling to differentiate scientific facts from propaganda. 
However, the problems go beyond just insufficient funding. Systemic inequity due to race and economic status has also spearheaded the downfall of education in this country. 
The U.S. Federal budget will be an estimated $6 trillion for the fiscal year of 2022. From that, education receives a meager $66.6 billion. In comparison, the United Kingdom’s national budget is £1 trillion and education accounts for about £100 billion. The British quantitative emphasis on education surpasses the U.S. both relatively and absolutely.
It is a rather embarrassing statistic for the U.S. The group to blame for it is none other than big-money lobbyists. 
To demonstrate their impact, analyze this simple — yet staggering — fact. From 1998 to 2011, Pentagon spending increased from $367 billion — relative to the 2010 value of the dollar — to nearly $690 billion. In that same time span, defense lobbyists increased from 611 to 952. Defense contractors have used their lobbyist soldiers to ensure tax-breaks and increased funding for the defense sector. 
While education lobbyists also exist, they do not hold nearly the same amount of power as defense lobbyists. Simply, the defense sector brings in greater political donations from fewer clients. In 2021, defense lobbying raked in nearly $58 million from 199 clients. Meanwhile, education lobbying amounted to $41 million from 581 clients.
Taking donations from the defense sector equates to a greater volume of money and fewer clients for politicians to appease. It is a sad reality that political donations dictate the academic well-being of children in the U.S. 
Shifting from an economic to a social perspective, there are numerous consequences from a broken education system. The most current being the subpar coronavirus vaccination numbers. Among the 11 states with the lowest rates, seven — West Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Idaho, Mississippi, Tennessee — rank among the bottom 20 states in education in the country. This cannot be a coincidence. 
Furthermore, adults with a bachelor’s degree have a vaccination rate of around 90%, while adults who do not have a high school diploma have a rate of 69%. These numbers reaffirm the role education plays in the vaccine distribution. 
And while It is easy to blame those who refuse the vaccine as the problem, it is really the system at fault. 
This system tends to oppress the middle and lower class. They often do not have any choice besides attending local public schools. This stems from redlining, which is the systematic denial of services such as education to specific communities often based on race. Even if a school has low academic rankings, they do not have the chance to attend a better school. They do not have the luxury of driving 30 minutes or enrolling in costly private education. The unfortunate reality is that they have to deal with whatever they can get.
Lower-income marginalized groups are unable to access higher education due to their lack of financial bandwidth. The median Hispanic household earns 74 cents for every dollar the median white household earns. Meanwhile, the median Black household earns even less at 61 cents for every dollar the median white household earns. The lack of resources and opportunities available to them is the epitome of systemic racism.
The clear solution to this is an increase in funding to the education sector. Increased spending generates more resources for education and increases the quality of them as well. These include higher quality textbooks, new technology, improving or launching art or sports programs, etc. Each of these factors enhance the student’s educational experience. 
Along with increased funding, leading with equity is equally important. Marginalized communities need additional resources and financial opportunities to make up for centuries of oppression. As it currently stands, these communities attend schools with fewer and lower quality books, curriculum materials and less access to computers or laboratories. In turn, this has led to higher dropout rates — 6.4% for Black Americans and 8% for Hispanics compared to the 4.2% for white Americans. 
Not to mention the fact that this oppression has generated a plethora of government mistrust among these communities. According to recent research by the Pew Research Center, only about 37% of Black Americans and 36% of Latinx Americans say they trust the current Biden administration. Shockingly, these numbers are considerably higher than from years past. The slight jump is mostly attributed to Donald Trump’s exit. 
In addition, around 70% of Black Americans expressed that they feel the medical system  discriminates based on race and ethnicity. This mistrust has manifested with only 40% of Black Americans and 45% of Latinx Americans receiving at least one dose of the vaccine compared to 57% of white adults receiving it. 
Ultimately, trust is essential. Vaccination rates would likely be higher if more Americans trusted science and the government instead of pseudoscience or other forms of misinformation. Increasing education accessibility should be the medium to rebuild this broken trust. 
In addition, modernizing the curriculum itself to fit the needs of the 21st century is just as crucial. Understanding mass media and developing the skills to recognize misinformation is a must for the next generation. We cannot afford to have a similar reaction to current vaccination efforts occur in the future.

I’ll be the first to admit that while I’ve heard the term “cryptocurrency” tossed around for the past couple years, my understanding of the concept remains subpar. When I asked my dad — whom I consider an expert in most things finance — for a succinct definition, his less-than-confident explanation of blockchains failed to enlighten me. Thus, I turned to the internet, and the article “What is Cryptocurrency?” on Dummies felt like a good place to start.  
From what I’ve gathered, cryptocurrency — unlike the United States dollar, the Mexican Peso or the Japanese Yen — offers a decentralized form of digital money not backed by a government. Cryptocurrencies, such as  the well-known Bitcoin, are created through mining. Powerful computers solve complicated problems to support blockchains, a sort of database that records the transactions made, thereby removing the need for a physical bank.
Although Bitcoin, the first form of cryptocurrency, was released in 2008, a spiked interest in cryptocurrency occurred this year. However, receiving Bitcoin is not as simple as cashing a check; one must create a digital wallet or use a third-party intermediary to process the payment.
Although I’ve given a bare-bones definition (which is hopefully somewhat clear), the most important thing to note is that cryptocurrency won’t disappear anytime soon. 
As cryptocurrency flourishes, nonprofits must decide if and how they will take part. While nonprofits shouldn’t turn away donations, they need to understand that accepting cryptocurrency comes with its own set of complications. 
According to a 2018 Global Trends in Giving Report, only 2% of nonprofits in the U.S., Canada and Europe accept cryptocurrency donations despite the increasing popularity of the system. 
The 2% of nonprofits accepting cryptocurrency is by no means a representative sample. While large universities such as USC have infrastructure in place to accept cryptocurrency, smaller nonprofits lack the resources needed for the pivot to digital donations.
This past summer, the University of Pennsylvania received a $5 million anonymous donation in Bitcoin. More volatile than stock, cryptocurrency poses risk for the nonprofit. For example, the $5 million donated to UPenn could be worth $3 million or $7 million in a week. Due to this, most cryptocurrency donations to nonprofits are liquidated immediately. UPenn used a third-party intermediary to liquidate the assets and transfer cash to the university. 
Working with over 2,000 different kinds of cryptocurrencies, small nonprofits lack the ability to accept, process and quickly liquidate different forms of donations. Additionally, nonprofit staff may not fully understand cryptocurrency and feel too intimidated to accept it. A small nonprofit staff might not want to bury their heads in a book about the intricacies of Bitcoin during their free time. 
Additionally, if more donors switch to cryptocurrency, smaller nonprofits could get left behind while larger nonprofits adapt to the change. The Giving Block, an organization meant to guide and advise nonprofits on incorporating cryptocurrency, aids nonprofits unable to accept cryptocurrency due to logistical problems. By providing them with the necessary resources, organizations such as The Giving Block can give smaller nonprofits a way to venture into cryptocurrency. 
Aside from mere logistical issues, the blockchains that run cryptocurrency allow for complete anonymity of the donor, which deters nonprofits who want to cultivate relationships with donors in hopes of future additional funding. This may be especially difficult for smaller nonprofits who often rely on a handful of large donors for the majority of their funding.  
Similar to Donor Advised Funds — which I’ve previously written about — cryptocurrency is not subject to capital gains taxes, which allows wealthy donors to avoid paying taxes. As cryptocurrency becomes a more popular medium for donors, the effects of cryptocurrency must also be considered. In theory, money flowing into nonprofits should have no drawbacks, but lax regulations may exacerbate existing inequalities that allow the wealthiest to evade taxes through loopholes. 
The potential for great rewards down the line could outweigh the initial obstacles of cryptocurrency. Often severely underfunded, nonprofits should not shy away from the opportunity to tap into new donors. Additionally, without the obstacle of differing government-backed currency, cryptocurrency simplifies international aid. Lastly, the use of blockchain technology within the transactions allows organizations to track the exact use of cryptocurrency for more transparency and accountability. 
Not all nonprofits will find it beneficial to accept cryptocurrency donations; a fair assessment considering cryptocurrency isn’t an essential form of donations. However, these smaller nonprofits must take their available time, effort and resources into careful consideration before they take the plunge.
