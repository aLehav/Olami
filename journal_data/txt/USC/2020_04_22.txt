In a quarantine-fueled television binge, I recently finished Hulu’s television adaptation of the movie and book “High Fidelity,” starring Zoë Kravitz as Rob. I’d give the show a solid seven out of 10, but Kravitz makes it worth the watch.
As shameful as it may be to admit this, I have not watched the movie from 2000, nor read the original book. Yet, in the show, Rob explains the rules of making a perfect playlist, and when searching for the rules online after watching, I stumbled upon the clip from the film with the list. 
“You gotta kick it off with a killer, to grab attention,” John Cusack’s Rob said. “Then, you gotta take it up a notch. But, you don’t want to blow your wad, so you gotta cool it off a notch. There are a lot of rules.”
In the show, Rob mentioned a few other rules, too. Make the last song the best one, since listeners will remember that the most. Don’t include multiple songs by the same artist, unless doing so is appropriate considering your theme. Never put the playlist on shuffle.
During my search for these rules, I also stumbled upon an absolute roast of playlist-sharing in the age of streaming from this GQ article titled “The Sexy Mixtape Is Dead and ‘High Fidelity’ Can’t Bring It Back.” The piece’s most memorable line punched me in the heart: “But texting a link to a drag-and-drop Spotify playlist (even one that follows all of Rob’s rules) is a gesture that reads more like self-promotional spam.”
OK, I get it. “High Fidelity” pokes fun at condescending music snobs who show off their random cultural knowledge in regular conversation. Though, I think labeling all playlists made for others as self-indulgent, arrogant or even boring does playlist-making a serious injustice. If done right, playlists can be heartfelt and intimate just for that other person, not just a reflection of what the maker enjoys.
Personally, swapping playlists has been a hallmark activity in almost all of my close friendships. Throughout middle school and early high school, I included a burnt mix CD in every birthday gift I gave. I grew familiar with my college friends’ music taste by stalking their Spotify playlists. Often, I can pinpoint which songs in my music library I discovered from a specific friend in a playlist they gave me. These collections of songs have become the soundtracks of my adolescence and early adulthood.
Plus, since the current pandemic is keeping the world from going on dates and in-person hangouts, how else are we supposed to share music with those we love? Zooming while watching the same live streamed concert? I don’t think it gets much better than a personalized playlist. So, with all this in mind, I’ve tried to put into words the playlist tips I silently follow while making my own.
First, pick a theme. Having some sort of focus helps narrow your search, so you avoid just adding random songs you like. Think about what the playlist recipient needs right now. Have they been stressed out lately? Make a calming compilation. Have the two of you talked about each other’s fears? Make a playlist with songs that remind you of the end of the world. Another fun theme I’ve followed in the past is using the order and titles of the songs included to tell a story. Try that out if you’re looking to get creative. 
On a related note, details matter. Make the title and description witty, cute or whatever adjective fits the theme you chose. Listen to the transitions between each of the songs to make sure the playlist flows well for peak listenability. Think about its length and alter it depending on the receivers’ free time and their attention span. I tend to make playlists about an hour long, featuring around 13 songs.
Finally, make your playlist diverse — if the theme allows! Include songs or artists they already love and ones you think they might like. Add music from different time periods as well. Try featuring a variety of genres, as well as artists with different races, genders and other identities. Giving your listener a hodgepodge of recommendations will avoid pigeon-holing your playlist and increase the likelihood that you’ll give your listener at least one new piece of music. (Plus, as a side benefit, you can brag about the range of music you know, which makes you seem extra cool.)
And, of course, have fun! Maybe you and your coronavirus pen pals can swap playlists and discover new tunes. When the world stops ending, those tracks will come in handy for the first post-coronavirus social gathering.

After starting Register, an organization aimed at helping young women at USC register to vote prior to the 2018 midterm elections, senior Ellie Burger knew she wanted to dive deeper into the world of civic organizing. As the first communication major and woman from USC to be awarded the Presidential Fellowship from the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, which provides college students the opportunity to learn about presidential leadership and governance, Burger has become an essential contributor to the start of nonprofit The Institute for Civic Organizing, where she is now working to bring civic organizing skills to students in the classroom.
“It’s [been] one of the most incredibly rewarding experiences because it just kind of shows me that your education isn’t limited to your university — it doesn’t stop there,” Burger said. “You can make the most of your education and your involvement in your community.”
It was through the fellowship that Burger was able to attend the Presidential Fellows Conference in Washington D.C. in October with fellow TICO founders, Uma Kalkar, Hannah Zimmerman and Maya Ungar, all college students from different universities. Together, the four launched the nonprofit to address the gap of civic engagement in formal education by providing a toolkit for students of all ages with suggestions on how to engage with communities through academic intervention and programs that bring activism into the classroom. 
Burger serves as the director of communications for the organization and is in charge of maintaining press relations, developing brand identity and implementing corporate communication strategies within TICO. She is also responsible for maintaining TICO’s image as an engaging, youth-driven, well-sourced and, most importantly, a revolutionary organization, Burger said. 
One of TICO’s programs, Organizing Civics, is the first standardized curriculum on social and civic organizing adjusted for primary, secondary and post-secondary schooling for students around the world. For this program, Burger works to create a universal image to represent TICO and effectively convey TICO’s message to potential education nonprofit partners. 
“There isn’t any curriculum centered around civic organizing,” Burger said. “Something that really sets us apart is that we found a gap and we’re trying to fill that … We are really actively sourcing a significant amount of lesson plans and information from people who are really experienced in [civic organizing].” 
The Organizing Civics curriculum consists of 225 individual lesson plans for teachers to integrate into their classrooms. It aims to cover the holistic experience of civic organizing — from describing successful examples in history, such as the civil rights suffragette movements, to including theories on apathy and reluctance to join a civic cause. The curriculum also provides specific technical instructions on shifting an idea into legitimate action by mobilizing resources, contacting donors and volunteers and addressing potential legal matters. 
Although she knows not every student has the intent of starting the next major social movement, Burger said she believes it’s essential for today’s youth to know they can create change within their communities and learn about the skills and resources to do so.
“I genuinely think that it’s important for people who see an issue in the world around them to do what is in their power to fix that,” Burger said. “I think that’s a part of who I am and how I’ve been raised, but I think it’s also a part of being a Trojan and part of the USC identity.”
Kalkar, a senior at the University of Toronto, said the goal is to help students become global citizens by focusing the curriculum’s examples and topics on the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals, including zero hunger, climate action and reduced inequality.
Although tackling some of these goals presented by the UN may feel ambitious for the average student, Burger said creating impactful change is not as daunting as it seems. 
“It’s not that hard to make change,” Burger said. “It’s hard to start yourself on that process to make it. Once you set your mind to it, it’s pretty easy, and people are pretty willing to change. It’s just that a lot of people aren’t there to motivate them.”
Zimmerman, a junior at Stanford University, said having Burger on the TICO team since the beginning has made the entire experience more enjoyable and efficient since she knows how to take advantage of her own skills and helps to accentuate the skills of others. 
“She’s just infectiously enthusiastic and positive, and she can make two-hour group calls feel like they’re 15 minutes long,” Zimmerman said. “She sees the best in everyone, and it can be really easy with someone who’s a little bit more reserved, like I am, to work with her because she manages to bring out the extrovert in you and she really is a team player.”
Burger and her peers at TICO said they believe that current civics classes at the high school and college levels are insufficient in teaching students how to apply their knowledge on government and policy into tangible and effective civic organizing, which discourages them from making that first step.
“A big part of this is making sure that the information we’re providing is accessible to the people that we are trying to reach,” Burger said. “You can provide people with resources but if they don’t understand what you’re saying, you’re not really impacting them or helping them at all. Ultimately, we want this to be a very accessible and youth-driven curriculum.
Burger said working with TICO has not only helped satisfy her interest in civic organizing but also reminds her that there is hope for future generations to tackle today’s biggest problems. 
“Even in uncertain times, there’s a foundation of people who genuinely want to make the world a better place,” Burger said. “And I think that’s something that excites me and kind of makes me feel a little more confident in where we’re going as a country.” 
Burger, who is graduating this semester, said working with her peers on TICO and developing their curriculum have been some of her favorite memories during her time at USC. 
“Honestly, some of my most fond memories of my senior year are going to be sitting in my sorority in my room, writing a curriculum for other students,” Burger said. “The fact that [creating change with the nonprofit] is even possible for me is mind-boggling. It just proves that if you want to do something, do it.”

Michelle Janavs, a USC-affiliated parent in the college admissions scandal, filed a motion in federal court Wednesday asking for her prison sentence to be modified in light of the spread of the coronavirus and unique medical circumstances.
Janavs was sentenced in February to five months in prison and two years of supervised release with a fine of $250,000 for paying for her older daughter’s admission to USC as a false beach volleyball recruit and for falsifying both her daughters’ ACT score reports. She is scheduled to begin her sentence at the Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas May 7.
In the motion, Janavs’ defense stated that her preexisting health conditions would increase her likelihood of contracting the virus, thereby posing a risk to Janavs, her fellow inmates and prison employees. While the section of the motion identifying her conditions was redacted from the document before public release, the defense stated that Janavs would also be at risk of developing severe medical problems as a result of the coronavirus if she became infected.
“If Ms. Janavs were to become infected with COVID-19, there is a high likelihood that she would have to be hospitalized to prevent the rapid deterioration seen in other COVID-19 patients,” the motion read. “The resources needed to save Ms. Janavs’ life could be, and should be, used for someone else.”
The defense argued that the prison environment is conducive to the transmission of the coronavirus, citing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that recommend enhanced sanitization and eliminating communal facilities to curtail the virus’s spread and accusing the Bureau of Prisons of continued negligence for its failure to maintain CDC standards for the virus’s containment. The motion quoted data regarding the number of confirmed cases in Bureau of Prisons settings, which has seen an increase of more than 43,000% since the first instances of the coronavirus in federal incarceration facilities were reported early last month. 
“The Eighth Amendment bars ‘cruel and unusual punishments,’ which includes deliberate
indifference to unsafe, life-threatening conditions and punishments,” the motion read. “Given the rampant, uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 in the BOP, and the acute risks that infection poses to Ms. Janavs, incarceration would be grossly disproportionate to the severity of her crime.”
With the motion, Janavs’ defense submitted a letter from the Office of the U.S. Attorney General recommending that nonviolent offenders with increased risk of contracting the coronavirus be released from federal penitentiaries and permitted to serve their sentences in home confinement. It also attached a notice from the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleging that the Bureau of Prisons had violated safety protocol in its failure to quarantine incarcerated workers who showed symptoms of the coronavirus.Janavs pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering for her role in the Operation Varsity Blues scandal.

As students settle into a routine of social isolation and Zoom classroom meetings, the perpetual question remains of when life will return to normal. Some universities have already started to address whether or not there is a possibility of returning to in-person classes in the fall. 
Boston University has opened up a dialogue on continuing remote education as school administrators consider completely online course offerings for the fall and reopening the campus for Spring 2021. 
Universities are trying to prepare for any possible outcome and are creating better and more interactive online learning programs, as well as improving remote student services to improve the  student experience and maintain overall retention rates. But as hypotheticals and possibilities continue to fluctuate, many students may face a new range of possibilities for how they may spend their semester and future academic career. 
The socially manufactured value that is placed on an ideal college experience and degree is bound to change as a result of the coronavirus. It has become common practice to take out student loans and graduate into massive amounts of debt. Much of what students pay for is experiential in today’s system, so the value of a college education will change if campuses become temporarily defunct and schools move to virtual instruction for the foreseeable future.
The American Council on Education predicted that enrollment for the upcoming school year could drop by 15%, including accepted freshmen who choose cheaper options like local community colleges and continuing domestic and international students changing their plans or taking time off.
Meanwhile, financial aid appeals are rampant as many families’ income and employment status have changed drastically as a result of the pandemic, and many wonder if it would be better to just delay by a semester or year until things are more certain.
One alternative is to take a gap semester or year, giving schools more time to retain a semblance of normalcy. Traditional gap years typically involve transformative experiences such as traveling, volunteering and working, but if social distancing or travel restrictions are still in place, students may not even be able to make the most of their free time. It’s difficult to say what might disrupt students’ momentum more: a full semester conducted completely online or taking a break from higher education altogether.
Recent graduates and those looking for full-time jobs may soon face a difficult decision too. Because of the now-impending recession and abysmal job market, many are looking to leap directly into another degree program to put off their job search. While the prospect of unemployment is scary, the amount of debt that students might incur while continuing their education is also a big consideration. Prospective grad students should make sure that there is value in obtaining another degree — graduate programs are a big investment, and it’s critical to find an area of study that will help students stand out when they do begin interviewing for jobs.
While students should not be making plans now, they should anticipate changes in the coming months and be prepared for a multitude of scenarios. The start of the fall semester is still months away, and circumstances are still changing on a daily basis. Universities have been working tirelessly to provide high-quality education to students, whether it be in-person instruction or online lectures. Ultimately, the value of each individual student’s education will come into question — keep in mind that there is no single right answer and that everyone will need to choose a path that is best for them.

“Why did you paint your nails? Did your girlfriend paint them for you?” 
I pause, interrupted from kneading a strawberry into soap and isopropyl alcohol. I turn around while wiping my sticky fingers on my chinos. “No, I do not have a girlfriend. Anybody can paint their nails, Jésus!” I grin as I shift uncomfortably. He narrows his eyes, suspect. I resume mushing the strawberry, working to help the students, whom I teach science weekly, extract the fruit’s octoploid DNA. 
“I thought painting nails was only for girls?” 
I pause again, breathing out as I mentally prepare my next response. “Actually, Sebastian, painting nails is just a behavior that we typically assign to females within a binary that equates sex with gender, but gender identity really is just a performance!” 
Fine, I did not actually say that to a third grader. However, while working with these elementary school students every week, I constantly thought of their naivete and how their surroundings mold their predispositions regarding gender. They are just kids, after all, but our culture simply picks them up in its currents and takes them along for the ride. 
These children are the byproducts of the same culture that perpetuates gender as a strict divide between male and female — blue versus pink, shorts versus skirts. Certain toys are for boys, and certain toys are for girls. Certain apps are for men, and certain apps are for women. 
Yes, you read that correctly. Giggle, a social app developed exclusively for girls, was intended as a platform for women to safely network and share interests. How does it ensure that only women sign up, you might ask? Just take one selfie, and that’s it! The app uses biometric screening software to analyze bone structure and determine if the face is of a “woman” before it grants users their golden ticket. However, one’s bone structure does not fairly determine gender identity — the software does not work for transgender women. 
Giggle’s software introduces a variety of problems such as collecting and storing personal images and information, as well as reserving the rights to share it with third-party websites. But beyond these issues, its software intended to ensure its exclusivity to women reinforces transphobia. It’s the same transphobia embedded in problematic counterarguments to trans bathroom access laws: If gender identity is really “fluid,” pedophiles and sex offenders can just use the trans identity to violate women’s safety. To effectively navigate these stereotypes and combat problematic gender identification norms, Giggle and other discriminatory media must adopt a new approach. 
Giggle ostensibly revolves around womanhood. But to be a successful app for only people who identify as women, Giggle must include all feminine-identifying individuals. As an app whose existence succumbs to the socially constructed gender binary and completely negates gender expression, Giggle is inherently transphobic. Bone structure is a biological characteristic that does not correlate to gender. Giggle is not an app for women — it is an app for people who fit into the biometrically determined construction of women.
Giggle is not the only circulating platform that misleadingly exploits “gender” as integral to its functioning. Zoom University, an intercollegiate virtual dating platform, matches applicants on double dates with their best friend. Sounds fun, right? Actually, your best friend has to identify as the same gender. And then, the double date is with two people of the opposite gender. 
Like Giggle, Zoom University relies on the socially constructed gender binary to function. The application states, “What gender is your group?” and the only two response options are “guys” and “girls.” Heteronormative and exclusive, Zoom University does not allow genderqueer individuals, as well as LGBTQ-identifying people, to sign up. The website is merely a hot spot for cisgender, heterosexual people. 
To deter from perpetuating outdated, societal gender norms that continually invalidate people’s identities, both of these sites must be fixed to yield inclusive and connecting platforms. After all, according to a survey by the World Wide Web Foundation, “more than half of young women have experienced violence online, including sexual harassment, threatening messages and having private images shared without consent.” 
Giggle could help avert gender-based internet violence — but in the same way critics argue against trans bathroom rights, Giggle harnesses women’s safety as a means to stand behind their discriminatory practices. The app is not just transphobic, but it pushes a trans-exclusionary radical feminist agenda — it appears to be fundamentally “feminist,” but it is merely exclusive to cisgender women. 
In addition to revising its privacy policy, Giggle must stay true to its advertising as an all-girls app. Because the bone structure biometric screening does not work for all women, perhaps the app can utilize an honor system instead. Information and photos will remain private, and all women can join regardless of biological characteristics. Zoom University can allow mixed-gender couples to sign up and participants can indicate their gender identity preferences. These adjustments would not only make these platforms more inclusive, but they would also aid in dismantling these toxic gender norms that our culture cannot seem to bypass. 
Meanwhile, I will continue dismantling toxic gender norms at elementary schools. I can just imagine my students returning home, saying, “Gender is a performance, mommy.” It is like music to my ears.

Almost as quickly as it disappeared, it has returned once again. I don’t want to tempt the fates and gods of Southern California football, but I just have to say it: USC recruiting is officially back.
After a yearlong hiatus that saw the program fall out of the national spotlight for at least 55 different reasons, the Trojans have returned solidly to form and have sent an unmistakable message to the college football world: USC is ready to “Take Back the West.”
Cheesy recruiting slogans aside, the Trojans’ infusion of fresh blood, new faces and high energy on and offline has resulted in landslide victories on the recruiting trail. After landing a number of blue-chip commitments from the likes of defensive back Anthony Beavers, running back Brandon Campbell and offensive lineman Maximus Gibbs, the biggest catch still lies in wait for the Trojans. 
On Tuesday, after plenty of speculation, the largest domino fell.
Korey Foreman, a local product from Corona Centennial, is not only the best player in the state in the Class of 2021 but in the entire nation as well. The superstar defensive end has shown his capability time and time again to wreak havoc on opposing backfields and frighten quarterbacks into submission. 
Foreman announced Tuesday his decommitment from Clemson, citing a desire to play closer to home in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Certainly, it is difficult to consider anyone a winner from a catastrophic event such as this, but it’s clear that the Trojans have made the most of their time indoors and off campus.
Foreman had long been expected to join USC and former teammates sophomore defensive end Drake Jackson and 2020 signee receiver Gary Bryant. While Foreman’s initial commitment to Clemson came as a relative surprise to many, the path now seems clear for him to make a triumphant homecoming and join a class that already ranks among the top five in 2021.
To many around the country, USC’s early success in the 2021 class is not only mildly uncharacteristic (at least by recent standards) but shocking considering the team’s recent shortcomings on the field. Embattled head coach Clay Helton did himself few favors in 2019 after struggling through an 8-5 campaign that came to a disastrous conclusion in a Holiday Bowl drubbing at the hands of a well-coached Iowa team.
Helton somehow worsened existing faith and enthusiasm in the program as he led the Trojans to their worst recruiting effort in recent memory after last season. The Class of 2020 cohort finished outside the top 50 nationally and 10th in the Pac-12.
Since hitting rock bottom, even by USC’s sanctions-riddled standards, Helton was able to rebuild quickly. By hiring experienced assistants in defensive coordinator Todd Orlando, safeties coach Craig Naivar and special teams coordinator Sean Snyder, Helton created a capable, cohesive unit of coaching and recruiting veterans to redefine the Trojan brand.
When he made the surprise splash hire of cornerbacks coach and nationally lauded recruiter Donte Williams, Helton turned heads up and down the West Coast and across the nation. Almost immediately, Helton found a way to flip the script on USC football and renew a sense of pride and belonging into the program.
It didn’t take long for recruits to notice and buy in and, at this early stage, there are still many rewards for Helton and company to reap. 
USC, despite wallowing in mediocrity season upon season, has re-established itself almost immediately as a monster on the recruiting trails and boards. In light of all that has gone wrong over the past few seasons, Helton’s Trojans have shown a much-needed glimpse into a brighter future ahead.

As I finish the last semester of my senior year from behind a computer screen, I glance around my bedroom which now triples as my lecture hall, research lab and office. When I left my small Southern California hometown of Redlands to move to Los Angeles as a freshman, I never thought I would end up graduating from college in the same room where I opened my USC acceptance letter four years prior. 
Just a few weeks ago, I was preparing for the last few months of my college life. I was finishing up essays and studying for exams, planning for commencement and spending time with some of my best friends who have been integral to my life since move-in day. 
Without any clue as to when we would be allowed to return to campus per USC’s decision to move classes online, students packed their personal belongings and textbooks; unknowingly, seniors left behind more than just our bedspreads and hygiene products, but also our pictures highlighting our last college memories and most near and dear possessions. We unknowingly spent one last night in our college apartments. We unknowingly said goodbye to our friends. We unknowingly stepped out of our last undergraduate lecture hall. We unknowingly made our last walk across McCarthy Quad, beside the Cromwell Track and within USC Village.
April — normally filled with worries about graduation photos, sashes embroidered with our college identities and invitations to our loved ones — has been transformed to a time of community endeavors and support to and from universities in all corners of the country. Eagerly, teams such as Trojan Shelter, Undergraduate Student Government and the USC Housing Equity Project rallied together to help others escape domestic violence, find shelter and offer resources to survive the many months to come. 
Aside from the glimmer of silver linings, the truth is that every senior deserves thunderous applause as our names are announced on the microphone. This was supposed to be our moment, a time to walk across the stage in front of our peers and soon-to-be colleagues, as our loved ones felt butterflies while watching the past two decades of our lives flash before their eyes. All we have now are muted microphones, disabled video settings and virtual commencement speakers. 
Though we may get to walk eventually, planning for the May 15 virtual graduation is not quite the same; jokingly, my family talks of the multipurpose uses for our living room coffee table as a stage and old sheets as a gown. On the bright side, at least my dog can now partake in the celebration. 
While the sudden end to senior year for college students has been devastating, it is not without intense gratitude that we take this time to practice social distancing and applaud all of our health care professionals and essential workers. The coronavirus should be taken seriously, but it is OK to grieve. 
We lost something extremely significant to us. Graduation is a huge milestone in our lives and the closing of a major chapter. For some of us, this marks the end of an organized education and the entrance into the real “adult world.” For others, it denotes the entrance into a complicated and elusive application cycle for graduate school. But for all us, it’s truly just the beginning. While our lives after this year will vary, we are a family — not just as USC students, but nationwide as a cohesive graduating class. Although college entrance essays varied widely across the nation, our departing statement of adversity is unified. 
So much has been left unsaid, but at least we know we are in this together. While we are advised to be at least 6 feet apart from one another, technology has enabled our connection across the nation, in some ways, to feel closer than ever. 
It is time to ingrain our minds with the last few memories of college we have: the last few conversations in hallways, the last professor we saw outside of a computer screen and the last few hugs we shared with our friends. While there is a resonant anxiety, I must say I am so proud. In what could arguably be the most challenging few years of college history, we have all gained an ability to persist despite the sensation of a constant trying, uphill battle. 
Writing this, I sit in silence looking at a quote I pinned to my bulletin board four years ago. “It’s the journey, not the destination.” Never before have these few words been so applicable. A lot has changed in the past four years, yet these turn of events have led me back to where I started. Often, I think about the first time I stepped foot on campus. Excited, but nervous. Overwhelmed, but finally at ease. Literally lost, but figuratively found. 
The truth is, I don’t know whether to cry from sadness or smile at the memories. While I did not have the pleasure of getting to meet all of you, I will be cheering for everyone in one of my oversized USC T-shirts from behind my computer screen come May 15. 
Congratulations, my fellow Class of 2020, we did it.

When 2019 alumnus Thomas Won volunteered at LAC + USC Medical Center last March at an inpatient unit, he saw firsthand some of the personal protective equipment and mask shortages that were beginning to occur in Los Angeles hospitals. Immediately after this experience, Won began planning on how to provide N95 and KN95 masks to health care providers on the front lines. 
Now, Won and the organization GetUsPPE LA provide PPE to medical facilities in underserved areas throughout L.A. County where there are larger clusters of coronavirus cases. There are now more than 15,000 confirmed cases in the county. Since information regarding PPE required by these facilities is not publicly available, the team contacts health care facilities to find out their requirements. So far, they have delivered to more than 40 health care facilities, including a couple of hospitals in Orange County that were in immediate need. 
“For us, it’s more really just a privilege that we’re able to do this,” Won said. “We don’t ask for their thanks or anything. We know that they’re in need, so we’re just trying to fill in that gap. We’re just trying to step up and do what we can.”
Before formally creating GetUsPPE LA, Won started a GoFundMe page to raise funds and buy supplies like medical gowns and goggles, which are difficult for the general public to provide. In one week, he was able to raise $11,000.
After realizing that it could take up to seven to 10 days to receive a shipment of masks from overseas, he considered developing a local donation system. While setting it up, Won contacted GetUsPPE, a national coalition for grassroots efforts to collect donated PPE. A logistics coordinator from GetUsPPE was able to connect Won with Christian Manley, a marketing administrator at USC Bovard College. 
“It’s been really inspiring to just see all the people out there that are doing efforts around getting PPE to health care heroes,” said Manley, who has worked primarily on marketing and outreach efforts. “There’s just so many people and organizations that have stepped up to help out, which is super inspiring, especially given how challenging it can be these days.” 
The initial GoFundMe that Won created to raise funds is now part of a section on the GetUsPPE LA website that informs users who are unable to donate PPE on how they can still contribute.
Won said the team reached out to the general public to get volunteers willing to pick up PPE from homes and other businesses.
In addition to collecting donations, Won’s parents, who are in the wholesale business, managed to work with contacts in China to source supplies from overseas. To begin the distribution chain, Won contacts the import coordinator to request certain supplies, like KN95 masks. The donation team then vets the supplies and manufacturers, checking their certifications and ensuring both the manufacturer and the PPE it makes have FDA approval.
Jessica Park, a 2017 alumna who serves as the donation coordinator and one of the project planners, has been working on the fundraising team since the last week of March. She joined when Won told her about the shortage problem he had seen while volunteering and his idea for fundraising. 
Park, while understanding the public’s initial fear surrounding the virus, said she did not understand why many were hoarding masks for themselves and seemingly forgetting the health care workers who face the virus every day.
“What stirred me up was that people were selling masks for their own profit or trying to get masks and buying them right away,” Park said. “I [think] the need was more for our health care workers or people that are actually in contact on a daily basis with possible patients or other people that might be carriers.” 
Until there are no longer any supply shortages, Won said the organization will continue to provide necessary PPE to medical facilities across L.A. 
“We don’t know when coronavirus will end,” Won said. “We don’t know when this PPE shortage will be met. It’s unpredictable — there’s no timeline. Until we hear that [health care workers are] doing okay with PPE shortages, it will be until then that we continue this effort.”

Students and employees expressed concern about coronavirus safety and campus notification protocol after Student Health reported an Everybody’s Kitchen worker’s coronavirus diagnosis last week. While USC Hospitality and Auxiliary Services have implemented prevention measures, including social distancing and requiring face coverings, students and workers remain uneasy about the potential spread of the virus.
EVK closed Friday for the remainder of the semester to curtail community spread within the facility after the employee tested positive the week before. EVK employees were notified April 12 in an email from USC that informed them that the employee last worked in the kitchen April 7 and attended a staff meeting April 10. 
The University confirmed that one worker who displayed symptoms did not test positive for the virus. Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman told the Daily Trojan no instances of community spread among EVK employees and students have developed from the case reported last week. 
“My co-worker said she was concerned about returning to a place where she could contract the virus,” said Maria Contreras, a guest services representative at EVK who has been taking a leave of absence from the dining hall due to underlying health conditions. “So, [Auxiliary Services management] told her to come back and that they would inform employees of everything they were going to do and that they had already taken measures to disinfect EVK.”
Van Orman said the kitchen was deep-cleaned April 12 following the report of the coronavirus case, but as of Saturday, residential dining services have moved to the USC Village Dining Hall, which is staffed by a different set of employees. Those who worked at EVK are taking paid administrative leave in line with the University’s policy for staff whose unit or department has suspended operations. Nonetheless, employees and students remain concerned about the possibility of exposure to the virus.
“It definitely is a little worrisome that there was a coronavirus case so close to my … living situation,” said Josh Weadick, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering who visited EVK every day until its closure because his dorm does not have a kitchen. Though Weadick was troubled by the news of the case, he believes that USC has taken the proper precautions.
Employees who had prolonged close contact with the individual who tested positive were notified individually and asked to self-isolate for four to five days, Van Orman said. Staff members not identified as having had close contact with the infected worker were asked to monitor and report symptoms to their supervisor and Student Health.
The only patrons USC identified who may have been exposed to the virus were those who visited the dining hall April 7, Van Orman said after looking into the infected employee’s work schedule and into when the symptoms appeared. Those individuals were notified of the case last Monday in an email from Student Health. However, the choice to limit those notified has left some students feeling uncertain. 
“I think all students should have been notified, especially within two weeks,” said Nathaly Macias, a junior majoring in business administration who did not visit EVK April 7 but frequented the dining hall before its closure. “Given the asymptomatic period, they could have been infected for two weeks prior to the employee finding out [they had the coronavirus]. There’s a lot of people that could have been put at risk.”
In an email to the Daily Trojan, UNITE HERE Local 11 organizer and representative Arelia Valdivia said the workers’ union has been in contact with USC regarding the positive coronavirus case and measures that should be implemented to prioritize the safety of EVK’s staff, which is a part of the group of housing and hospitality workers the union represents. She said the union also believes the University has taken necessary precautions, including closing EVK. 
“[USC] has been in communication with [UNITE HERE Local 11] since there was a positive [coronavirus] case among our membership,” the email read. “The Union has been working to ensure that all precautions are being taken to prioritize the safety of our members.”
Essential University employees exposed to the coronavirus who need to self-isolate receive paid leave, Van Orman said. Workers’ compensation benefits cover the cost of medical care related to the virus.
Although Contreras believes the paid leave of absence and social distancing guidelines are important steps from USC, she believes the University should do more to ease employee concerns about contracting the virus. 
“My co-workers do have these concerns and fears that they have contracted the virus and may bring it back to their families, to their homes,” Contreras said. “I think that it would be a good idea for workers to be tested to bring them peace of mind so that they may continue working.”
As USC continues to take precautions, Van Orman and Auxiliary Services have continued to reiterate health practices to prevent the spread of the virus including wearing face coverings in all public places on campus and practicing personal hygiene. 
“We believe that so far in all the cases we’ve had in employees, they’ve been acquired,” Van Orman said. “We know that there’s community transmission within Los Angeles, so we can anticipate that people will be acquiring it in other parts of their life, but we want to be very, very careful to not have any further spread within USC.”

With the coronavirus pandemic forcing institutions to postpone college milestones, including graduation, many students will instead spend the remainder of their spring semester indoors on Zoom. Seniors Claire Monro and Claire Fisher decided to commemorate their last semester at USC through their clothing business Fight Online while giving thanks to the local businesses that helped make their experience on campus worthwhile.
The duo named their clothing line Fight Online to commemorate USC’s transition to online learning. The business initially started with a playful intent. After realizing a deserted campus also meant that many local businesses near USC, including Caveman Kitchen and El Huero, were losing sources of revenue from student customers, they decided to refocus their work to provide financial support for local businesses.
“We really hope to just provide support to these businesses and say that even though we’re not on campus, and we’re not actually patronizing your store in person, we’re still here for you and we still appreciate what you’re doing for us as students,” Monro said.
Monro and Fisher received increased support after emailing President Carol Folt to see what avenues they could explore with their idea. Folt put them in contact with David Wright, senior vice president of administration, whose duties include overseeing the USC Bookstore, and Wright helped the pair sell more shirts and receive more donations by advertising the product on the USC Bookstore website and expediting the licensure process for the business. 
“I think they were able to double the amount of money that they could actually donate because they got to work in partnership with the bookstore,” Folt said. “It’s one of those things that people want to help each other. It’s just so touching to me that everybody that writes to me seems to want to help somebody else and so whenever I can help someone help someone else, I’m finding that’s something that I really want to do.” 
Of the Fight Online duo, Fisher takes on the product design and development, using skills she accrued with her communication design minor. Monro handles the entrepreneurial side, working with mentors from the Marshall Career Advantage Mentor Program to help reach out to different offices on campus and to facilitate the growth of the business. 
“We wanted it to be really simple and sleek and not obnoxious or anything,” Monro said. “We found different design templates on the Bonfire website, and Fisher was able to put something together to make it look clean and sharp.” 
Monro and Fisher originally spent a few days designing the T-shirts before working through Bonfire, a site that facilitates custom shirts for fundraising.  
The brand has sold nearly  600 shirts through the Bonfire website and the USC Bookstore and continues to grow its customer base through social media and USC newsletters of organizations including the Blackstone Launchpad. Awaiting purchase money from Bonfire, the pair has yet to distribute financial proceeds to local businesses, including El Huero and 3 Brother’s Bike Shop. 
Monro said Fight Online is also currently creating a licensing agreement with the help of Wright and is considering donating to establishments depending on the number of students who visit. 
“When we were thinking about who to donate to, we kept going back and forth thinking who really had an impact on our time at USC and it differed for every person we asked,” Monro said. 
For Folt, initiatives like Fight Online show how students respond to crises: by helping those around them. 
“What touched me about [Fight Online] was that recognition that our students are getting to know the local vendors,” Folt said. “They want to find a way to do something that I think is artistic and entrepreneurial.”

Senators presented the formation of an intersemester senatorial committee at the Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday. Composed solely of current senators, the committee would be in session during the Summer 2020 term and contend with student issues related to the coronavirus, including advocating on behalf of the student body to administrators and providing necessary resources. 
“If we don’t have [the] Senate operational at all, and we suddenly saw that there was a need for advocacy …  but we didn’t take precaution or responsibility or early measures to compensate for the ability to take any action, we would have our hands tied and we wouldn’t be able to operate at all,” Sen. Ruben Romeo said. 
Initially proposed by Sen. Gabriel Savage, the committee would meet online at least once per month with the goal of providing any necessary services and resources to students during the summer. 
“It’s not necessarily only [being created] to offer operations, but even just to be prepared and familiar with actions we can be taking during the summer in preparation for fall as well,” Romeo said. “This is all very precautionary, in my opinion … I think it just makes sense that we are best prepared.” 
The Senate also heard an amendment to the USG bylaws regarding USG executive staff stipends. The amendment would decrease the stipends for the president, vice president, chief of staff, chief financial officer, chief programming officer, chief communications officer, chief diversity officer and speaker of the Senate in order to allot money for stipends for assistant directors of funding, communications and programming departments. 
“As it stands with being paid, I will always strongly advocate for what I think is fair and just,” Romeo said. “I’m pretty happy with the changes being made by the USG administration and the decision to give them pay.”
The budget allocation committee also presented its proposal for the 2020-21 fiscal year’s budget. Because of the uncertainty regarding how enrollment numbers may be affected by the coronavirus and whether on-campus classes will resume in the fall, the committee chose to allocate to the contingency fund reserve at least 20% of the discretionary fund, which funds programming put on by recognized student organizations. 
“The 20% is just a more conservative estimate on how enrollment numbers might change,” USG President Truman Fritz said. “We don’t know what the situation is, and we just want to make sure that we are being responsible. Because this can be allocated at a later date and approved by [the] Senate again, we felt like this would be the best move forward.” 
In addition, many of the allocations to departments within the programming branch were evaluated by their ability to move events and programs to next spring semester if remote classes continue through the fall. Departments such as the Trojan Pride Committee received an increase in funding because its events could be conducted virtually if necessary next fall, while Concerts Committee had its budget cut due to its inability to move its events online. 
“If we are allowed to have virtual programming events in the fall, that’s one thing that we support,” treasurer Mike Shao said. “I think that’s one thing that the student body would really enjoy, especially if we weren’t able to go back to campus, but that does decrease costs for a lot of events.”
