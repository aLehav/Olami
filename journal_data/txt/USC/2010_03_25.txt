As part of its continuing efforts to aid Haiti, the USC Keck School of Medicine is planning to send teams to Haiti in early April and is working to create permanent trauma facilities for the country devastated by an earthquake more than two months ago.

Last week, a group of three Keck doctors traveled to Haiti for a day to conduct an assessment tour and prepare to send teams April 3.
“We’d like to offer our assistance for as much and as long as possible,” said Dr. Lydia Lam, an assistant professor of clinical surgery at the Keck School and one of the doctors who went on the tour.
Lam will be part of the first group going to Haiti on April 3. The group will work with a University of Miami team at the Project Medishare facility.
“There remains continuing medical needs there, and what we’ve done at the Keck School is developed a sustained response where we’ll be sending teams of individuals on a weekly basis starting in April,” Keck Dean Carmen Puliafito said. “We’d like to keep doing this over the short term, over the next several months, and, at the same time, we’re looking at participating in a process of developing a set of trauma and acute care hospitals in Haiti.”
Puliafito met with the deans of the School of Social Work, the Viterbi School of Engineering, and the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences and other schools to actively engage the USC community in Keck’s efforts to help rebuild Haiti.
Puliafito said he has considered sending interested medical students and residents to serve in Haiti later this year when the environment has stabilized. If students go, attending physicians would accompany them to oversee their work.
“We’re going to do our best to stay involved in Haiti,” Puliafito said. “It’s probably the greatest humanitarian crisis that has occurred in the Western Hemisphere ever because of the tremendous loss of life, 300,000 people dead, tremendous destruction of the infrastructure, and in a country that was really quite poor.”
While the three doctors conducted the assessment of medical needs in Haiti, Dr. Henri Ford, vice dean for medical education at Keck, and Amy Puliafito, the project manager for the Keck School’s Haiti Initiative, attended a conference in Washington, D.C., where they met with Haitian medical leaders and leaders of U.S. Academic Health Centers, non-governmental organizations and other colleges and universities. The conference attendees shared information about different relief operations to identify and coordinate strategies for future efforts.
According to Amy Puliafito, the ongoing challenge for the U.S. Health and Human Services, academic institutions and non-profit organizations is assessing where resources are most needed based on the damage sustained to medical facilities and their current capacity to see and treat patients and provide critical and emergency care.
“The situation on the ground in Haiti post-earthquake demonstrated the limited capacity of … the Haitian health sector,” Amy Puliafito said. “The lack of critical care availability — I think that really came out post-quake.”
Ford, who went to Haiti immediately after the earthquake with a medical relief team from Keck and is originally from Haiti, said he recognizes the importance of staying involved in the relief efforts.
“There is no question after spending two weeks in Haiti and … after seeing the magnitude of the suffering and the ongoing medical needs, I have decided that I need to remain engaged,” Ford said. “As a pediatric surgeon who is Haitian-American, I feel that I am uniquely positioned to help establish a trauma health system in Haiti.”
Ford said Keck is working in conjunction with the University of Miami, Project Medishare, Haiti United and the Haitian Ministry of Health to form a public-private partnership in addressing the country’s future medical needs.
“We believe that this initiative is going to establish the national trauma critical care and rehab center in Haiti that is going to allow people to finally begin to get the quality of care that they can benefit from,” he said.
Ford is leading efforts toward building a sustainable critical care infrastructure in Haiti. He said the project cost is estimated at $60 million.
“The situation in Haiti is really serious. The problem did not just end after the administration of emergency medical help,” Ford said. “The calamity persists, the need is ongoing and therefore our commitment to supporting Haiti cannot stop.”
Since returning from the conference, Ford has gone to Miami and Haiti and met with representatives from the University of Miami and Project Medishare as well as Haitian Ministry of Health officials to discuss priorities in rebuilding the Haitian medical system.
“Seeing the hope, the faith, the determination in the Haitian people was also very reassuring,” Ford said of his interaction with people from his experiences in Haiti after the earthquake. “In their despair, they never lost faith. It is for this reason, I believe that ultimately Haiti is going to bounce back, Haiti is going to be stronger than ever and Haiti will regain its position as it once was, the jewel of the Caribbean.”

Students enrolled in Practicum in Advertising and Promotion Design (MKT 406) are helping to find the next generation of federal investigators here at USC.
To gain practical experience in marketing, students enrolled in the class have been developing their skills by implementing marketing campaigns for various clients — including the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
MKT 406 is a class that allows students to get hands-on experience running real marketing campaigns. The class partners with EdVenture Partners, a non-profit organization that helps find clients interested in working with the class. This year, the FBI has chosen to utilize the class’s resources to promote a campaign it hopes will enhance the number of applicants to the agency.
Professor Therese Wilbur, who has taught the course since 2006, believes the class is vital for students preparing for a career in marketing.
“We execute campaigns for clients,” Wilbur said. “This course really stands out on a résumé.”
At the beginning of the semester, the school gave the class a budget of $3,000 to run an effective campaign for the client. The FBI hired the class to run a marketing campaign to recruit 100 applicants for the FBI — 50 forensic accountants, who have similar responsibilities to financial analysts, and 50 for the specialist investigation division, who gather intelligence and perform physical surveillance.
“The overall objective is to develop an integrative communication program that delivers on two objectives: investigative specialists and forensic accountants. The class has to research and develop a campaign that emits those objectives,” Wilbur said.
To start, the class conducted primary research on student perceptions of the FBI.
Using that information, they brainstormed ideas for the campaign and condensed them into a campaign message and final strategy.
FBI representatives arrived on campus at the beginning of March to provide feedback for the campaign’s direction. The campaign was launched shortly after.
“We executed the campaign across the West Coast,” Wilbur said. “After we execute, we will evaluate the results to see how or if we met [the FBI’s] objective.”
Lauren Peterson, a senior majoring in communication and a student in the class, said three different campaigns were originally pitched: “Investigate your Future,” “You’re the Missing Piece,” and “Think. Do. Live.”
“Now, we are doing ‘Think. Do. Live.,’ which was our strongest point,” Peterson said. “That’s what will be on all the posters and T-shirts, which are meant to recruit applicants.”
Benjamin Gutierrez, a senior majoring in public relations, said he thinks the class promotes marketable skills.
“This class provides real world experience for students,” Gutierrez, who is the public relations director for the class, said. “It demonstrates why it’s important to have good writing and communication skills. That’s what employers are looking for.”
Gutierrez said the class operates like a real public relations agency.
“Students understand how to deal with conflict and the clients’ boundaries,” Gutierrez said. “The class is almost like a full-time job.”
The students said running the campaign taught them about what works and what doesn’t in marketing campaigns.
“Trying to get donations during a tough economy is hard,” said Tobi Ogundipe, a senior majoring in music industry, and a member of the class. “Our budget is pretty small to reach who we want to reach — undergraduates. So I’ve learned to utilize the contacts we have, from campus representatives to local businesses.”
The class also benefits the client, Gutierrez noted.
“The FBI gets hardworking students. I feel like they get really great results from qualified students,” Gutierrez said.
Peterson noted that one benefit of the class, aside from gaining valuable experience, was addressing FBI stereotypes.
“It’s interesting to know what the FBI actually does. Everyone has this image from the media of what they are about,” Peterson said. “They are secretive about a lot of things, but you just have to work around it.”
Gutierrez embraced the stereotype as another obstacle to tackle through the campaign.
“It’s a challenge for us to break down the stereotypes of FBI agents and communicate that to everyone else,” Gutierrez said.
In fact, he said he has seen what makes the FBI so rewarding to work with.
“It’s every public relations agency’s dream client,” Gutierrez said, “They don’t shoot everything down, they have constructive criticism.”
Ogundipe said she saw firsthand the FBI’s intelligence in working with USC students.
“I think the FBI is really ahead of the curve when it comes to teaming up with college students,” Ogundipe said. “They need to use undergraduates to put the word out there.”
As part of the campaign, events will be held on campus April 6 and April 8. The first event will be for investigative specialists, and the second event will be mainly a meet-and-great for graduate students interested in applying to the FBI.
Wilbur said the benefits of taking the course are long-lasting.
“This course has really opened doors for previous students in terms of getting interviews,” Wilbur said. “It’s all a potential employer wants to talk about.”
Students currently taking the course are not surprised.
“This is not your typical class,” Peterson said. “This is a group of USC students putting on an entire campaign for the FBI. This proves that USC students can do real-world work. How often do you get to prove it?”
Great Story!

The Economic Development Committee of the North Area Neighborhood Development Council kicked off the first of a series of forums with a discussion Thursday night aimed at collecting opinions about the university’s Master Plan and constructing a proposal to pass along to the university and city hall.
Planning · Kirk Cartozian, a representative from the real estate advisory services of Cartozian Associates Real Estate, moderated a discussion Thursday among students, community members and university officials. The discussion focused on the Master Plan. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
“We’re trying to get ideas from the community and make recommendations that we’d like to see included in the [Master] Plan,” said Samantha Foley, one of the two USC student representatives on the NANDC and a senior majoring in political science and international relations.
A group of about 20 business owners, residents, USC professors, students and representatives from labor unions met in the University Village on Thursday to discuss the Master Plan, a guiding document that details the university’s plans for expansion and renovation over the next 30 years. Participants mainly discussed housing displacement, affordable housing and whether the Master Plan will address both real estate issues.
Kirk Cartozian, a representative from real estate advisory services of Cartozian Associates Real Estate and a USC alumnus mediated the question and comments between the audience members.
Cartozian spoke of developer investments and how the community can benefit from entitlements.
“You guys are hopefully going to be creating a voice for yourself, and that’s the most productive way to see how your surrounding is in the future as investment comes, development comes, how you can get the most for your local affected area,” Cartozian said.
Cartozian said the first step needed is to assess the needs of the community — what might be lacking in the community and what resources might already be out there. Getting to one voice will be hard, he said, but the members of the audience will be able to come to a reasonable solution.
The U.V., which will be bulldozed and redeveloped as part of the Master Plan, was one of the main topics of discussion.
Business owners said they are worried their businesses will lose the relationship they have with the community and face higher lease rates. Likewise, community members said they were worried the U.V. will cater to students and not the community.
Foley, who said she has been talking directly with USC representatives, said that so far the idea is that the new U.V. will be both a community and student space.
“As they get close in the development process, they want a better idea of what community members want; it’s not going to be just what students want,” she said.
David Galaviz from USC Government and Community Relations said the retailers in the U.V. need to operate year-round.
Galaviz said so far retailers such as Forever 21, a community-serving bookstore, Superior Grocers or a related supermarket, restaurants like Applebee’s, a small hotel and a community movie theater are possibilities for the new U.V.
“The goal isn’t to develop something like The Grove,” he said.
Aside from the development of the U.V., community members also spoke about housing displacement and affordable housing.
Gloria Serrano, a resident of 37 years, said she’s seen the community change drastically, and there has been much displacement.
“A lot of housing has been turned into student housing. But in no way we are speaking against the students,” she said. “Families are forced to pay a large amount to live in small apartments because of rent hikes.”
Galaviz said USC has been talking about including a financial aid stipend to encourage students to move in to new student housing that will eventually be developed as part of the Master Plan, rather than moving into community housing. The plan would create about 5,000 more beds for undergraduates.
Another community resident, Dennis Brathwaite, acknowledged housing displacement but also said there needs to be a balance between community members and students in the area.
“I think the students like the interaction with the local people … I think there’s a familiarity with the students and the people from outside.”
Christina Gotuaco, a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning agreed, saying she likes living in the urban area and interacting with the community.
“It’s just nice to have this community feeling that you wouldn’t get if USC was segregating the students from the community members,” she said.
City Council Representative Dennis Rodriguez, communications assistant for Councilmember Bernard Parks, said the Neighborhood Council should put together a reasonable proposal in writing within the next two weeks to present to the city community redevelopment agency, planning department and our council office.
Shawn Simons, president of the NANDC, said she understands that not everything on the proposal will make its way through to the Master Plan but said she hopes the city will listen.
“We want to do our diligence as a community to give a full-fleshed out proposal … You win some and you lose some, but we don’t want to hear [after we submitted the proposal], ‘Sorry, you closed the books on that,” Simons said.
The next forum will take place April 29 at 7 p.m. at the U.V. computing center.
“Likewise, community members said they were worried the U.V. will cater to students and not the community.”
The UV should cater to students since that is the majority of their business! Without USC, the community would not have developed to what it is today and it would probably be just another ghetto slummy neighborhood full of cheap fast food restaurants and shady landlords. I sure hope USC takes over.
Shouldn’t USC provide Universal Health Care for the community? How about we leave this community as it was ten years ago, or maybe make it like an Indian reserve forever. Then students can come to show their caring about the poor dude down the block whenever they need a community service unit.
Honest to God, reading this kind of stuff drives me nuts.  Here we go with the whole romantic Che Guevara notion of standing up to the man.
It’s quite simple.  USC has some of the very best communication and entertainment academic programs in the entire world with the rest of the university not far behind.  On balance, the long term economic growth of the United States is more important than displacing a few people in the immediate neighborhood.  I understand their concerns and the displacement is going to happen; it’s a classic case of eminent domain and while things have to be done in a moral and humane way, they nonetheless have to be done.  As stated above, those neighborhood residents receive a ton of benefits by virtue of being close to the university that they would not otherwise have, namely private police patrol with a 30 second response time and excellent public schools infused with some of the best and brightest college students in the country – good luck having that kind of safety and that caliber of schooling in the rest of the city.
All that said, the neighborhood went in reverse from the 30s through the 80s  I’m sure that the other posters believe that the slumlords who came in and gutted the neighborhood’s beautiful older Victorian homes had hearts of gold, right?
No one will get displaced, I believe. Only those greedy landlords who can not milk student’s rent are complaining. They just want a bigger bite of the pie, that is USC.
The morality is questionable? The morality of what? Improving one’s property? Student’s complaint about “gentrification” and Heinrich’s suggestion that USC would “alienate” local residents are both based on the idea that self-improvement is by itself insulting to people who have not improved. It’s one of these white-guilt type ideas. I challenge you to find any genuine homeowner in the area who will say he’s OFFENDED by the prospect of cleaner and safer streets, better emergency services, more retail options, renovated architecture, and rising property values. 
People and universities and cities improve themselves. We all hope to leave the world a bit better than we found it. There is no moral imperative to limit your aspirations so that others won’t think that you think that you’re better than them.
While it’s true that USC does have the legal right to revamp the UV and make such sweeping changes, the morality is still questionable. Personally, I’d prefer to have positive relations with the community and make do with some subpar retail outlets than alienate all the families living around here. LA’s a big city and more interesting shops and restaurants are not far away. You can’t have the college town experience in a big city without trampling on innocent people. That’s just life. Everyone lamenting that USC is “too urban” or “in the ghetto” should have known what they were getting themselves into when they enrolled.
It is not the university’s job to cater to the community. USC is a private school that answers to its donors and students who pay top dollar to attend. It does not need to fund and support the needs of the surrounding community.
To “student”: I disagree with your assertion that USC has an “underhanded” goal of pushing community members out of University Park.  Your attitude suggests you’re bitter about something USC has dont to you and not what USC has not done for the community at large.  USC does more for their surrounding community than ANY other university in the nation!!  
The UV is owned by the university and should be developed in a way that supports its students interest first.  The community residents benefit GREATLY from USC not just in philonthropic ways but by having USC’s privately funded police force patrol their neighborhoods and help keep them safer than they would be in any other area of south LA.
Relations between USC students and the community are definitely not as positive as this article makes it seem.  I know a lot of great students involved in and working with the community, but for the most part students are just trying to go to school, be safe, be able to party and be catered to.  Not much of a real understanding that their stake in the community as students is not nearly as great as the people who grew up here and have families here.  
For families it is not just about a good 4 year experience, it is about a good life, as well as a peaceful, safe and healthy community to raise their children in.
USC using students as agents of gentrification is very underhanded, needs to be adequately addressed.

The tough road stretch continues for the No. 5 USC men’s tennis team as it officially begins Pac-10 play in the Pacific Northwest this weekend with two matches.
Partner up · Junior Peter Lucassen has compiled a 10-2 record in dual meet doubles matches when teamed with junior Jaak Poldma. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (14-2, 0-0), play today at No. 65 Oregon and head up to Seattle on Saturday to face off against No. 21 Washington (15-1, 0-0).
Spring break started with a disappointing loss at Duke but concluded with an impressive victory at Georgia — snapping a 71-home-match win streak for the Bulldogs.
With the Georgia victory, the Trojans feel they are headed in the right direction heading into conference play.
“Coming home from the Georgia match we gained momentum and positive energy,” senior Jason McNaughton said. “Now we head up to Oregon and Washington with confidence.”
Confidence is important as Pac-10 play opens up, but it alone will not carry the Trojans against teams who have had successful seasons thus far.
Oregon (11-4, 0-0) has one ranked singles player — No. 91 senior Alexander Cornelissen — and one ranked doubles team. Historically, USC has had success against the Ducks with a 15-0 all-time record.
Washington’s 15-1 start is the best in the school’s history, and the Huskies currently own a 10-match winning streak.
As with Oregon, Washington has one ranked singles player — No. 54 junior Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan — and one ranked doubles squad.
The Trojans have played eight of their last 10 matches away from Marks Stadium. The travel has been taxing, but there have been some positive results.
“It brings the team closer together,” sophomore Steve Johnson said of the travel.
Injuries have continued to be an issue throughout the season for USC. During the break, the injury bug hit senior Robert Farah and sophomore Matt Kecki.
Even though no coach would want any injured players, USC coach Peter Smith looks at this situation as an opportunity to display the depth of his team.
“That’s the bright side of injuries,” Smith said. “We have new guys playing, so we have some fresh blood. We hope to have [Farah] playing this weekend and Kecki later in Pac-10 play.”
McNaughton stepped in admirably during spring break and won two of the three matches he participated in, displaying senior leadership and the depth of the team as a whole.
The Trojans will need contributions from all players as the conference season progresses.
“Everyone has stepped in immensely this year, and we will need that for the rest of the [Pac-10 schedule],” Johnson said.
The scheduling of all of the recent road matches has been designed to test the Trojans and build character, and they will have two more opportunities to continue to do so on the road this weekend.
“We played so much on the road to be able to handle the road and build that toughness,” Smith said. “Let’s see how we handle it.”

“The idea is to learn something in here for when you get out,” Reyeb tells Malik, the main character in A Prophet — a film about a young thug who learns how to develop his own criminal network while incarcerated in a maximum security prison.
Not only was the French film nominated for best foreign film at this year’s Academy Awards, but it is also a monumental example of technically perfect filmmaking.
Like Malik, who has much to learn if he wishes to survive to see his sentence through, many American directors still have just as much to learn if they ever hope to compete with the standard of excellence set by French cinema.
The film centers on Malik (portrayed with incredible grace by Tahar Rahim), a young Arab who is violently initiated into the ruthless Corsican mob that runs the prison. The focus of the 155-minute masterpiece is Malik’s observation and eventual take over of the powerful criminal unit headed up by César Luciani (flawlessly embodied by veteran French actor Niels Arestrup).
A Prophet might seem like an ordinary prison movie at first, but it quickly and clearly reveals itself to be one of the best films currently playing in theaters. And it’s because of the brutal yet mesmerizing filmmaking that went into its production — a style that has been absent in most American films since the 1970s — that the film stands apart.
Director Jacques Audiard’s style is enhanced by stellar performances and a script so smart, it literally redefines the abilities and potential of contemporary cinema.
Along with its Oscar nomination, the film also won the Grand Prix at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in addition to taking home nine César awards — the French equivalent of the Oscars.
But such prominence is nothing new for Audiard, whose previous film, 2005’s The Beat That My Heart Skipped, expressed the same style and received the same adoration.
Like A Prophet, Audiard’s earlier film predominantly featured characters surrounded by crime and violence. This is typified by its protagonist Thomas, a young aspiring pianist whose father (also portrayed by Arestrup) just so happens to be a mobster with serious problems.

The film also earned Audiard César awards for best film and director, as well as a supporting actor award for Arestrup. Like A Prophet, it deserved everything it received, and then some.
All of this praise stems directly from Audiard’s unique filmmaking style. The notion of innocence being eclipsed by crime is prevalent in his work. Audiard’s style is to prolong intensity enough to curdle viewers’ blood, at which point all that built-up intensity explodes with shocking consequences.
His films generally leave audiences thinking long after they’ve left the theater.
Audiard’s skill is his ability to pack so much into a confined space — like a prison — and then ignite the whole thing. But his real charm comes from his direction and the film’s ability to take its time and set up every minuscule detail for the resultant explosion to unfold just right.
Audiard’s intensity makes a full-force appearance in full force in a very simple scene in A Prophet in which a few glances across the prison yard and a fist into someone’s stomach are the only clues to confirm that Malik has been studying extensively to become a cunning and ruthless gangster.
Audiard’s films are slow at first. In truth, there isn’t gratuitous action in either movie — rather, the audience becomes engulfed in the process, such as Malik’s developing education.
He is depicted in transition, not as an outright gangster. The audience witnesses the process of his conditioning, which is found both on and off screen.
A Prophet’s screenplay is enormously intricate; its creation is the result of precise detailing. So much happens in the film that, initially, much of the plot seems irrelevant, but every detail comes back for the film’s dramatic conclusion.
The script, combined with spot-on direction and fierce performances, showcases Audiard and his unconventional style as one of the  truly premier styles of filmmaking in cinema today.
Recent American cinema, particularly crime films, never receive this much attention. There are, of course, notable exceptions — Martin Scorsese, the Coen brothers and others — but the fact is most American crime flicks are sloppy and require very little effort on the audience’s part. These barriers stop American cinema from becoming as rich and as powerful as it could be.
American directors must learn to appreciate the kind of dedication required from both the production crew and the audience in order to perfect cinema, and for this they can look at A Prophet and its director, along with hundreds of other French films that perceive this dedication as necessity, not as novelty.

Members of the USC track and field team will head north this weekend to take on the competition at the Stanford Invitational in Palo Alto, Calif.
The meet, which takes place over the course of two days, will be another chance for several Trojans to show what they can do against some of the best athletes in the country.
However, USC coach Ron Allice is having most of his short-distance runners stay in Southern California to rest for the upcoming Texas Relays on April 1-3.
“I don’t believe in over-racing people,” Allice said of his decision. “We’re trying to stay afloat here, and I don’t want to risk tiring some people out.”
Allice’s other reason for holding back sprinters like senior Ahmad Rashad is the fact that the Stanford Invitational is primarily a showcase for the best distance runners in the nation and focuses slightly less on the sprints and hurdles.
USC will still be represented by distance runners like sophomore Blake Shaw, who will compete in the men’s 1,500-meter race, and senior Nate Anderson, who will run in the 800-meter race.
On the women’s side, the 4×100-meter relay team — including senior Shalina Clarke, who will also run in the 100-meter hurdle race — will compete. Also competing in the event will be sophomore Dalilah Muhammad, who won the same event at this past weekend’s Trojan Invitational. Senior Elizabeth Olear rounds out the women’s sprinters going to Stanford and will run the 400-meter dash.
For the women’s distance squad, junior Zsofia Erdelyi will run in the women’s 10,000-meter race, looking to build off her first-place finish at the Trojan Invitational.
For most of the team, however, the focus remains on the Texas Invitational.
“It’s just too much running to risk sending them to Stanford,” Allice said. “They’ll face much more intense competition at Texas.”

After pocketing a much-needed win last week against Fresno State, the No. 21 USC women’s tennis team is ready to take on some more Pac-10 foes this weekend.
First look · Freshman Valerie Pulido has made a strong impression in her first year with a 21-7 overall record and an 11-4 dual meet record. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
First, the Women of Troy (9-6, 1-0) will host the No. 19 Washington Huskies (9-2, 1-1) in a 1:30 p.m. match this afternoon before facing unranked Washington State at noon on Saturday.
The last time the Huskies and the Trojans dueled was in the 2009 NCAA second round, where the Huskies upset the Trojans, handing them a 4-3 loss.
The Women of Troy need these conference wins to help their Pac-10 record, in addition to their team ranking; and they definitely don’t want to fall to the Huskies twice in a row.
“We’re playing the best teams in the Pac-10 coming up, and we’re really hungry to regain our top spot in the Pac-10 and in the country,” sophomore Alison Ramos said.
In the present ITA rankings, junior Maria Sanchez leads USC in singles at the No. 3 rank.
Sanchez currently holds a seven-match win streak and boasts a 12-5 singles record.
Also in the top 25 is Ramos, ranked at No. 20. Following close behind are freshmen Danielle Lao and Valeria Pulido at No. 32 and No. 82, respectively. In doubles, Pulido and Sanchez rank No. 56, while junior Lyndsay Kinstler and Sanchez are ranked at No. 62.
The Washington team, with many nationally ranked players, will provide a big challenge for the Women of Troy. In singles, Denise Dy is No. 6 and Venise Chan is No. 15, and in doubles, Dy and teammate Joyce Ardies are ranked at No. 11.
Even with its dominant win over Fresno State during spring break, USC is still recovering from its latest upset to then-No. 32 Arizona State two weeks ago.
“We came together as a team after the ASU match and discussed what we need to do differently to compete better,” Ramos said. “We made practice more individualized this week in order to work on the specific things we needed to improve upon.”
“We’re doing our absolute best to figure out what’s good for the team right now,” Lao said.
Even though USC lost to Washington the last time the two teams met, it holds an overall record of 16-2 against the Huskies.
“[This] is a big match,” Sanchez said. “We have definitely been waiting a while for this rematch.”

Explain to me again why expanding the NCAA tournament is a good idea.
Because it’s not. Plain and simple, it just doesn’t make any sense.
There are those who say more is always better. But when it comes to the tournament, less is more.
It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to prove that the current format is golden. There are 65 teams, and almost all have a legitimate shot of winning a game in the tournament.
Robert Morris (No. 15) nearly beat Villanova. Ohio (No. 14) toppled Georgetown. Cornell (No. 12) shot the lights out on its way to the Sweet 16. And of course, Northern Iowa (No. 9) shocked the world, stunned Kansas and might not be done yet.
As Kevin Garnett might say, anything is truly possible. It’s only a matter of time until a No. 16 takes out a No. 1.
But it has taken a while to get here.
The tournament started with eight teams and eventually expanded to 32 teams in 1975. By 1979, it was at 40.
Through 1984, it expanded three more times to 53 before moving to a 64-team format in 1985.
And for 25 years, we’ve been at that level (except for, of course, the addition of a 65th team for the play-in game).
But again, it has taken a quarter of a century or so for the lowest seeds to gain respect. It took a very small number of Ali Farokhmaneshes and a few years of Gonzaga as Cinderella to prove that anybody can win on any night in the tournament.
Sure, we were shocked when the Big Red took out Temple and Wisconsin. We were truly stunned when Farokhmanesh buried that 3-pointer and beat the Jayhawks.
But it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility. We’ve come to accept the fact that those things can — and do — happen in March.
So what will happen if the field expands to 96? How long will it take for us to truly respect No. 24 seeds? Another 25 years or longer?
Won’t the tournament be watered down when the 12th-place Big East team is a No. 20 seed and the third-place Great West team is a No. 23?
Yes, it will. We’ll yawn as the first round features more blowouts than anybody wants to see.
Let me remind you that only four No. 15 seeds have ever actually beaten a No. 2, and a few more have come close. So what makes you think a No. 23 can step in and do the same?
Sure, the names of Bryce Drew and Farokhmanesh have gone down in history for some of the greatest shots of all time.
But they’re rare as it is, so will putting more teams in the tournament really give us more magical moments?
Probably not.
And then, of course, what happens to the National Invitation Tournament? It’s almost as old as the NCAA tournament, and it too has a great tradition.
It’s a 32-team tournament that weaves its way through various campuses across the country before finishing in Madison Square Garden, one of the most storied venues in sports.
But a 96-team tournament expands the NCAA field by 31, robbing the NIT of about 97 percent of its field (for those of you keeping score at home).
That gives us a watered-down NCAA tournament and a watered-down NIT. Exciting, right?
So as we march toward April 5 and the national title game, take a few minutes along the way to ask yourself: Would expanding the tournament really make it better?
A lot of signs make it seem like the answer is no.

The No. 1 USC women’s water polo team takes great pride in its defense, but Thursday’s 18-4 thrashing of unranked Long Beach State at McDonald’s Swim Stadium was a celebration of the Women of Troy’s offensive prowess.
Quick fire · Senior utility Forel Davies had a hat trick by the time the first period ended on Thursday and finished the first half with five goals. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
Facing Long Beach State for the third time this season, the Women of Troy (13-1, 2-0 MPSF) overpowered the helpless 49ers (7-13) on the offensive end of the pool. Led by senior utility Forel Davies, who scored six, USC totaled 10 scores in just the first 12 minutes of the contest. And as usual, USC coach Jovan Vavic was quick to credit the defense for the success.
“Our defense was very good,” Vavic said. “We played very disciplined defense, we showed hands, and we didn’t commit any silly ejections. And then, we were able to convert our shots. Pretty simple.”
But it was Davies who got the team on track in the early minutes. The senior, whose previous career high for single-game goals stood at three, recorded a hat trick within the first quarter alone to help ignite the rest of the offense.
“Lately, I’ve been trying to play the game more than anything else,” Davies said. “I’m really just focusing on having fun and being patient. That really helped to calm me down and not be jittery early on.”
But for USC, it wasn’t a one-woman show that powered them to a victory. In addition to Davies’ six goals, eight other players found a way to get on the scoreboard, including junior driver Joelle Bekhazi, who also netted a hat trick, including two in the second half.
“I know this is cliché, but teamwork was a big part of the win,” Davies said. “We just try on focusing on setting each other up and being positive and happy when other people score.”
Even with a lead in the early parts of the game, the Women of Troy refused to be complacent as the game wore on, scoring eight second-half goals to cap an impressive outing.
“We stayed focused,” said Vavic on his team’s consistency throughout all four quarters. “The last couple of games, we didn’t play that great in the fourth quarter. So this was just a better performance throughout the entire game.”
Balance remained one of the team’s strong suits against the 49ers, as the defense was seemingly as stifling as the offense was proficient. Facing an aggressive front, Long Beach State was unable to get on the scoreboard until the latter minutes of the first half when a Krizia Cerda shot snuck past USC senior goalie Tumua Amae.
But it wouldn’t be until midway through the fourth quarter the 49ers would score again on Amae, who finished with 13 total saves.
“We were focused, but [Long Beach State] is still a very young team,” Vavic said. “That youth showed today.”
Even while notching yet another conference victory, the Women of Troy won’t be getting much rest anytime soon, as they are scheduled to face No. 14 San Diego State on Saturday at home. A win would mark their 12th straight in the season as they head toward the heart of Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play.
San Diego State (16-10, 0-4) is coming off a disappointing loss to Hawai’i in which utility Amber Pezzolla contributed a hat trick, but the Aztecs were unable to muster enough to hang with the Rainbow Wahine.
Pezzolla is the Aztec’s leading scorer with 42 goals on the season, and also leads the team in assists.
Containing Pezzolla and getting past goalie Kelly Campoli will be key to any success the Women of Troy hope to have against the Aztecs.

The Pac-10 might be the toughest conference in all of college baseball, and tonight, the Trojans get their first taste of league play.
Reliable · Sophomore infielder Ricky Oropesa is one of only three Trojans to appear in all 21 of USC’s games this season. Oropesa leads the Trojans in home runs, slugging percentage, stolen bases and walks while also batting .341 with 28 hits. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
USC (11-10) begins its 2010 conference schedule in Palo Alto, Calif., with a three-game set against No. 19 Stanford (10-5).
Redshirt sophomore pitcher Andrew Triggs takes the hill in tonight’s series opener at 5:30 p.m. against Stanford righty Jordan Pries.
There are no easy weekends in the Pac-10, in which two teams are undefeated (Arizona State is 20-0, UCLA is 17-0) and nine of the 10 teams have winning percentages above .500 (Washington is 8-10).
But USC coach Chad Kreuter believes USC’s opening opponent is not  unbeatable.
“I think everybody thinks that Stanford’s program is on this pedestal, and, really, it should be. They’re one of the best national baseball schools,” Kreuter said. “But they are beatable.”
Stanford had won six of seven games before losing Tuesday at Pacific, 9-4. In the defeat, the Cardinal committed two errors and left 14 men on base.
Kreuter stressed the loss to his team Tuesday night as proof of Stanford’s fallibility.
“They will make mistakes,” he said.
Stanford has made plenty of mistakes this season. The Cardinal have the worst team fielding percentage in the Pac-10 and a 5.35 team ERA, ninth in the conference.
The Trojans come into the weekend one game above .500 and in the middle of a grueling stretch of road games. They have played eight of their last 10 on the road, going 6-4 over that stretch. But Kreuter doesn’t want to settle at .500.
“I can’t stand it,” he said. “There’s nothing average about what I do or what I try to convey, and .500 is average to me.”
USC has proven it has the offensive firepower with six regular starters hitting above .300. Freshman infielder Cade Kreuter is on a tear, batting .346 with four home runs and 14 RBI.
Sophomore infielder Ricky Oropesa is hitting .341 after starting slowly and has a team-leading six home runs, and sophomore infielder Matt Foat has four home runs and 24 RBI to lead the squad.
Still, Kreuter wants more consistency out of his team.
“It seems like we win some series then slip a little bit and slide,” he said. “We need to take it to the next level.”
The Trojans lead the all-time series with Stanford, but would like to forget their last trip to Sunken Diamond. They lost the Friday opener 4-0 before dropping the Saturday game 26-5. USC salvaged the series finale with a 10-9 win.
But Kreuter said the events of two years ago are long gone.
“I don’t think guys even care what historically was done or what wasn’t done,” he said of that series. “They’re in the moment right now. There are a lot of guys that feel like they have to prove something right now.”
USC will throw sophomore pitcher Ben Mount in the second game of the series against lefty Brett Mooneyham. Mount has been solid for USC this season, pitching a 2-1 record and a 3.21 ERA. Mooneyham has struggled, going 0-2 with a 8.62 ERA.
Senior pitcher Kevin Couture will go into the series finale against another lefty, Scott Snodgress.
Both games will start at 1 p.m.

California voters will have the chance to decide whether to legalize the possession of marijuana after election officials announced Wednesday that the measure will be on the state ballot in November.
If it passes, the Golden State would be the first to legalize marijuana for personal use in the United States. BusinessWeek estimated that about $15 billion in marijuana is sold each year in California.
“This is a watershed moment in the decades-long struggle to end marijuana prohibition in this country,” said Stephen Gutwillig, California director of the Drug Policy Alliance, which has spearheaded the ballot initiative.
Supporters of the measure turned in 694,248 signatures, more than the 433,971 needed to qualify the initiative for the ballot. About one-fifth of the signatures required came from Los Angeles County.
The Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010 would allow adults over age 21 to carry up to one ounce of marijuana for personal use, which was previously a misdemeanor under California law, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The measure also lets cities and counties adopt ordinances to tax the sale and use of marijuana, creating revenue for communities suffering under the California Budget crisis.
The measure will face proposition, however, as a Field poll shows that only 56 percent of California voters want to legalize marijuana use.
Gubernatorial candidate and state Attorney General Jerry Brown has spoken out against legalizing marijuana, and has ordered crackdowns on pot dispensaries in the past.

After years of USC fans declaring the Trojans the number one college football team in the nation, USC football can further corroborate that claim as it now holds the record for all-time bowl wins — as result of an NCAA ruling.
NCAA sanctions against the University of Alabama erased 21 of the football team’s victories from 2005-2007, including the Cotton Bowl win over Texas Tech. Without the Cotton Bowl win, Alaba a now holds 31 bowl wins placing them behind USC’s 32 all-time bowl wins.
Not only did the NCAA ruling prevent the Crimson Tide from sharing the all-bowl wins record with USC, but it also moved Alabama further down the list of all-time football victories. UA is now the seventh college football team in all-time wins with 792 football victories instead of the fifth with 813 victories.
In June 2009, the NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions penalized Alabama for transgressions involving 16 sports. Because the Crimson Tide overlooked the benefits that 201 student-athletes at Alabama received, the NCAA felt it necessary to revoke the football victories in which the ineligible players participated.
These student-athletes exploited the university’s textbook distribution program by receiving extra textbooks and other class materials even though they were not authorized to do so.
“There is no evidence or allegations of other NCAA violations; no coaches or administrators were involved; no players obtained books and sold them for cash, and all the books were returned or charged to the student’s account as required by the UA textbook policy in effect at that time,” Alabama President Robert Witt told tidesports.com.
Alabama attempted to appeal the ruling by the NCAA because the university found only 22 students who intentionally attained textbooks for themselves and others, but the NCAA would not revoke their decision.
While USC is currently at the top, fans must remember that the NCAA Committee on Infractions will announce the results of our own sanctions in the weeks to come.

Even when stranded by a blown spark plug in a hotel lobby somewhere in Texas, Ryan Hunter can’t deny his love of life on tour.
Head first · Envy on the Coast includes (from left) Jeremy Velardi, Ryan Hunter, Sal Bossio and Brian Byrne. - Photo courtesy of Earshot Media
“It’s really nice getting out on the road again and seeing the country,” said Hunter, the 23-year-old front man of Long Island post-hardcore outfit Envy on the Coast. “You miss all those little things like looking out the window at five o’clock in Florida and watching the sun go down after having some beers and an afternoon show.”
Hunter’s band is currently in the midst of a North American tour that will lead them to Anaheim, Calif., this weekend for the opening day of The Bamboozle music festival.
But for as much as the guitarist and vocalist might romanticize life on the road, Hunter most enjoys returning to New York and his native Long Island.
In the recently debuted video for “Head First In The River” — the first single from the band’s upcoming album Lowcountry — Long Island landmarks and some of the band’s more personal haunts are prominently featured.
Among other authentic hometown backdrops, the video spotlights a dam by guitarist and vocalist Brian Byrne’s house, a dock in Hunter’s friend’s waterfront backyard and a set of train tracks where the bandmates spend a good portion of their summers hanging out and drinking beer.
“All the places in that video and the people in the video are the real deal,” Hunter said.
It’s impossible to disengage Envy’s sound and lyrics from the band’s Long Island roots. The area plays a critical role in all the music the band produces and work they do creatively.
“Long Island is not the type of place where you’re really proud of the cultural diversity or necessarily the people that come out of there or the reputation that we get in regards to that,” Hunter explained. “I think the reason that we love being from Long Island is the actual geographical stuff there and the nature.”
Fortunately for Hunter, the things he and his bandmates love most about home could be translated into a visual medium like the music video.
The band entrusted young directors Erick Sasso and Brian Wendelken — also Long Islanders — with the task of converting “Head First In The River” from strictly sound to a more complete audio-visual product.
Sasso and Wendelken, whose past adaptation of Raekwon material roundly impressed the boys of Envy, had already proven to have a vision compatible with the direction Envy sought for the song.
Hunter had written a few treatments and concepts for the video himself — most elements of production were kept in-house — and is pleased with Sasso and Wendelken’s execution of the band’s vision.
“They killed it,” Hunter said. “Every single verbal idea that I painted for them, they went and took it three steps further and made an incredible video that really, I think, epitomizes what we’re about and what Long Island is about.”
Hunter said the band really wanted to give fans an idea of where they came from. “We wanted it to be pretty true to form in regards to what home is like for us,” he said.
When Lowcountry, the sophomore follow-up to 2007’s Lucy Gray, is released Tuesday, Envy on the Coast will prove their continued dedication to the ideals of musicianship, as well as their strong convictions regarding the importance of crafting a solid and cohesive album — not simply a collection of standalone songs that are heavy on the hooks.
Actually, the band was reluctant to place too much emphasis on the selection of a single at all. When the band’s label, Photo Finish Records, chose “Head First In The River” as the track that would represent Lowcountry, whispers of a possible push to radio made Hunter and his bandmates deeply uneasy.
“We have a certain paranoia that we’ve developed over the year just from watching our friends’ bands break up and call it quits,” Hunter said of his mistrust of placing too much emphasis on a single. “We work hard on a record; We don’t go in there looking to write a hit song.”
Like a lot of musicians, the guys of Envy on the Coast resent the idea of one song representing their whole band, rather than having a listening audience that will hear and consider their album in its entirety.
Hunter said the objective of the band’s recording process is to produce a snapshot of where the band is in its life and career at that particular moment in time.
“That’s how we look at records: They’re just like a 10- to 12-song snapshot of what you’re being influenced and hit by at that point,” Hunter explained. “It’s an opportunity to make a whole piece that expresses yourself, not just one song … because when it comes to the songs, we just kind of play and jam and let things hit us, so you kind of need 10 or 12 songs to get your whole point across.”
If the excitement of their life on the road is at all reflected in Lowcountry — it really should be, given the band’s method of capturing the spirit of the present in a rock Polaroid of sorts — the new recording will make for great listening.

The No. 7 USC men’s volleyball team took advantage of a Division II opponent and started mostly backups, yet was still able to submit a strong performance, sweeping Grand Canyon, 30-27, 30-20 and 30-26 Thursday night at the Galen Center.
The match started close, as Grand Canyon was not fazed by its Division I opponent, hanging with the Trojans (11-9) in the first set until junior outside hitter Sean Dennis converted a kill to break a 22-22 tie and the Trojans were able to take control of the opening set.
The second set was equally close until USC scored 10 of 12 points to storm to an 18-12 lead that it would not give back. The Trojans hit a combined .488 in the second set.
Grand Canyon kept the third and final set close as well, as the teams were tied at 20, but USC moved out to a 26-22 edge before edging out the Antelopes to complete the sweep.
Junior outside hitter Sean Dennis led the Trojans in kills while hitting .579 for the match, while Connor Dougherty led the Antelopes with 13 kills.
The Trojans will hit the court April 1 against No. 11 UC Irvine in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation action.

If you look at anything under a magnifying glass too long, it’s bound to burst into flames. The same could be said of the intense media scrutiny that has been directed at the state of the Sandra Bullock-Jesse James partnership: with so many news outlets focusing on the still-unfolding story of Jesse James’ extramarital affair with professional harlot Michelle “Bombshell” McGee, the only direction the story can go now is up — in flames, that is.
Just as we saw in the sensationalized Tiger Woods scandal earlier this year, lascivious stories of lurid interest have a way of snowballing out of proportion. The prospect of claiming one’s 15 minutes of fame has a way of coaxing women (at least, they’ve all been women so far) out into the open — women who would’ve previously been satisfied with a notch in their bedpost that came from a PGA champion or badboy mechanic with a TV show.
In Sandra Bullock’s case, it’s very likely that the first crack in the dam came from the weight of all the attention resulting from her surprise win in the best actress category in this year’s Academy Awards ceremony. As soon as the story broke, reporters were all too happy to cast Bullock as “America’s sweetheart,” an epithet I hadn’t heard applied to the illustrious star of Miss Congeniality 2: Armed & Fabulous before there was a need to cultivate her image as a pitiable damsel-in-distress. Once a scandal like this gets going, it can almost keep itself going indefinitely.
The only way to keep stories of this nature from mushroom-clouding out of proportion is to cut off what is, in effect, the fuel to their fire: Media attention. To this end, I would implore any bloggers who may be reading this to cease all deleterious coverage of this scandal, and to do your part to keep it from invading the blogosphere.
Thank you for your cooperation.

Although the current administration has only been fighting for health care reform for a year, the debate has been raging since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. Congressional approval of President Obama’s historic health care legislation marks the biggest overhaul of health care in 45 years — since President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare into law in 1965.
The new reform bill will provide coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans, attempt to control rising costs and prevent common insurance company abuses. Californians, however, have reason to feel especially blessed. As a result of recent recession layoffs, a staggering 8.2 million people in California do not have health insurance. That one in four of us under the age of 65 are currently uninsured emphasizes how health care reform is especially crucial for Californians.
Despite what the Republican following at USC might tell you, the health care reform bill is a good thing for the state of California.
Fortunately, the historic bill allows college graduates to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until age 27. This will provide a degree of financial relief as we struggle to find jobs during the economic downturn.
Saya Taniguchi, an undecided freshman, said she was relieved by the provision. “It’s going to be nice to be able to use my dad’s employer-based insurance well after I graduate, in case I can’t find a job which provides me with alternative coverage,” she said.
Adults who already have employer-based health insurance will not see much change to their policies over the next few months, but they will have peace of mind knowing that in the event they lose their job, they cannot be denied coverage or charged higher rates because of pre-existing conditions.
Opponents of the reform bill have attempted to convince the rest of the country that the bill will bankrupt America.
Most independent studies, specifically the one performed by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, indicate that the legislation will actually reduce our national deficit by $138 billion over the next 10 years. Current health care expenditures are very high because of physician and provider overtreatment; the new bill hopes to curb some of these costs by increasing the out-of-pocket costs to patients, encouraging price-based decision making rather than wasteful hospital visits.
More importantly, Medicare costs will go down because doctors and medical institutions will be paid for the quality of their services rather than quantity.
America is the only advanced nation in the world that does not guarantee health care to the vast majority of its citizens. Just like historically contested reforms of the past such as Social Security and minimum wage, we will look back on this health care bill as an indispensable part of our country’s safety net.
The health care reform process still has a long way to go before its full implementation in 2014, but at least it has begun.
Gokul Agrawal is a senior majoring in business administration.
Interesting. My comment has been deleted. What’s up with that? It’s unfortunate, since I had carefully pointed out young Gokul’s entirely flawed reasoning. Sad to see censorship right here at the DT, but I guess not surprising.
“Fortunately, the historic bill allows college graduates to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until age 27. This will provide a degree of financial relief as we struggle to find jobs during the economic downturn.”
Nice… we have gone from wanting prosperity and jobs, to wanting leaders who will force other people to pay our bills so that unemployment is less unpleasant. I guess this is the “hope” generation.
It was a lot of fun watching these idiotic Republicans “warning” the Democrats that the passage of health care reform will cost them dearly at the polls in November. It’s going to cost someone dearly, alright, but it won’t be the Dems. Former Bush 43 speechwriter Davin Frum put it perfectly yesterday when he said that it was the Republicans – not Barack Obama – who had met their “Waterloo”. The historical rule of politics, that an incumbent president’s party always loses ground in the midterm elections, will go out the window come November. They will be unable to win without the help of the moderates. At this moment the moderates are abandoning this sinking ship en masse. The extremism of people like Michele Bachmann and John Beohner is starting to scare the hell out of them. Gee, I wonder why!
Then there is the sticky situation of the Tea Party. By this late point it must be obvious to even the casual observer that this is an organization comprised of morons. It was formed as a protest movement against high taxes – immediately after President Obama passed the largest middle class tax cut in American history. There’s no denying it, these are not the brightest people on the planet. Their overt racism notwithstanding, they sure are funny! One self identified Tea Partier called into C-SPAN’s Washington Journal the other day asking the moderator where she could write to her congressman. When host Greta Brawner asked this idiotic woman what her congressman’s name was, she replied (I assume with a straight face) “He’s a Democrat. I don’t know his name.” Ya gotta love ‘em! Ya just gotta!

Santa Monica-bred band Princeton evokes a plethora of adjectives, but “conventional” isn’t one of them. For many bands, the determination of a band name can take nearly as much time as the actual production of a record. But the four native Angelenos see nominal titles as self-important and an unnecessary distraction from the production of quality music.

“We don’t really think a band name is that important,” said keyboardist Ben Usen. “A band name is just a name, it’s like picking a screen name for AIM. It’s a name to represent you but most of the time it doesn’t really mean anything.”
Usen’s words are as refreshingly sincere and original as his band, which will bring its sounds to USC this weekend. Princeton will perform on campus Sunday, opening for San Francisco-based noise-pop band Thee Oh Sees at the second annual KSCR Fest. This year’s festival lineup boasts an eclectic sampling of local artists such as The Entrance Band, Rumspringa, The Growlers and student band The Smiles. And Usen couldn’t be more excited.
“We grew up here, we live here. We’re around and we want to be accepted by L.A.,” Usen said.
At only 24, Usen has enjoyed a life-long friendship with the band’s two main members — songwriter, vocalist and guitarist twin brothers Jesse and Matt Kivel. The Kivel brothers’ childhood home on Princeton Street in Santa Monica developed into a place of early collaboration for the three young musicians. “When I was a little kid, I would always go over to their house, and we’d hang out there. That’s where we recorded and wrote all our music,” Usen recalled.
On first listen, Princeton’s debut studio album Cocoon of Love, released last September, could mistaken for British pop music. Their achingly nostalgic lyrics and use of horns, keyboard and string instruments evoke some of the softer rock sounds attributed to bands like The Kinks that emerged from London in the late ’60s. This style can be traced back to the fact that the band’s official formation occurred during a semester the trio spent studying overseas in England.
Although the four performers all went to different colleges around the country, they always shared a love for London.
“We’ve always been fascinated by British culture and British pop music,” Unsen said. “We were studying abroad in different schools in London and living in different areas, but we came together and played a bunch of shows. That’s when we really evolved as a band.”
Not only did British artists like Oasis and Ray Davies shape the band’s early sound, but Princeton’s formation while writing and performing in a foreign country also helped it mature quickly into a close-knit, creative entity. And instead of being concerned with meaningful band names or lifestyle factors, Princeton’s main focus has been its music since graduating and moving back to Los Angeles.
“We want to make really great and interesting records that reflect us at the time of when we made the record. Each record should be its own entity,” Usen said. “We want to create a catalogue of music that we can look back on and be proud of how interesting and creative it is.”
Their first album, A Case of the Emperor’s Clothes (2006), was self-produced, as was 2008’s four-song EP, Bloomsbury. One might expect the lyrics of a Santa Monica-based band to be filled with sun-kissed imagery of beach culture and beautiful bikini-clad women, but instead, the Kivels’ quirky and clever lyrics incorporate their love of literary figures and respective works. References to the Bloomsbury group — a sect of 20th century British intellectuals like literary queen Virginia Woolf and her husband Leonard — pervade the lyrics of the eponymous EP.
Music reviews billed the band’s debut effort as “whimsical,” and the Los Angeles music scene marveled at the band’s ability to craft accessible and fun songs from such intellectual sources.
After the critical success of Bloomsbury, however, Princeton refused to grow complacent with its established sound.
“We don’t want to be pinned down to a sound and make records that all sound like each other,” Usen said.
With an album title taken from the early ’90s Nickelodeon show The Adventures of Pete and Pete, Cocoon of Love is tenderly woven with a bittersweet nostalgia for the carefree days of childhood.
“Cocoon of Love captures that element of romanticism of being a young child and your teenage days when you had a crush on a mysterious girl. It’s not really an emotional thing but more like a sense of immaturity. A lot of these ideas stem from our childhood, and Pete and Pete was a way to name an album that captured that nostalgia and romanticism,” Usen said.
Princeton will once again be in a state of sonic evolution when they perform at the KSCR Fest this Sunday. Hopefully, they can replicate the lively energy that effuses from their records and transform Founders Park into a British rock venue.

Google’s recent decision to stop censoring results on its Chinese website and redirect Chinese users to its uncensored Hong Kong site has caused substantial contention among various communities. The Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper, the People’s Daily, denounced Google’s apparent objective and moral façade.
The company is “not a virgin when it comes to values. Its cooperation and collusion with the U.S. intelligence and security agencies is well-known,” an article said.
Chinese experts have also said that Google will suffer by losing a vital partner in China. In fact, China represents the world’s largest Internet market with 400 million users, and the country’s two largest cellular communication companies are expected to end their respective deals with Google.
Human rights activists have applauded the company for maintaining a position of unrestricted information and setting a precedent for future censorship issues.
This standoff between two giants triggers a certain memory, though one on a much smaller scale. At my high school, being protected from taboo subjects and certain articles by reputable news sources like Newsweek wasn’t uncommon. In no way are such restrictions in high schools the same as China’s expansive human rights violations and hacking activities. The two are conducted with different intentions and have vastly different implications. But in the end, it is wrong to block content of any kind.
Some limitations were reasonable — no high school student should be accessing pornographic sites at school. Other times, particularly when researching to write articles for the newspaper, the censorship was exasperating, and hindered us from accessing sites with content the school district deemed inappropriate or objectionable. That content included information remotely related to illegal drugs, homosexuality and everything conventionally considered taboo. So without access to information that was vital to our research and should have been accessible, it obstructed our work and only added to our frustration.
As members of Generation Y, which makes up a substantial population of Internet users, firewalls merely cause resistance. Blindly blocking people from accessing content doesn’t teach or protect them from anything. On the contrary, it inspires creative methods to bypass and defy authority. The information on the web is for everyone’s use, and mistrusting people’s abilities or intentions is insulting.

Governing as a helicopter parent authority is stifling to the people of a nation and only brews dissent. Think about ourselves as college students: Being monitored and unreasonably censored in any sense ultimately carries with it more costs than benefits to authority figures.
Similarly, Chinese Google users are usually well educated and have the ability and willpower to speak up.
As New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof put it, “Young Chinese are impatient for change, and their impatience is compounded by the siren song of the West.” The Chinese Politburo wants to restrict the free flow of information on the Internet, but its people are diametrically opposed to such censorship.
Thus, for the Chinese government to regard Google as an enemy against its people would be a huge mistake . Furthermore, having a dominant world power as a symbol of censorship probably won’t win many enthusiasts over.
Such a divergence in opinion between the people and the government raises numerous red flags. If the government cannot lead the people into believing in censorship, coercion alone won’t do the job. This disconnect is not only embarrassing for Beijing, but it essentially undermines the use of the Internet.
Sure, Google may lose the Chinese market and its governmental support, but its revenue from the Chinese market — between $250 and $300 million — is a drop in the ocean compared to Google’s total annual revenue of $24 billion. Google said it refuses to act as an “agent of the Chinese government,” and instead abides by its name and mission — making the world’s googolplex of information universally accessible.
Senator Byron L. Dorgan, (D-N.D.) said to the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, “Information is not to be feared, and ideas are not enemies to be crushed. The truth is China too often wants a one-way relationship with the world.”
What is also true is that a one-way relationship in any context isn’t sustainable.

I also appreciate that Google eventually stuck to some scruples and avoided obligatory censorship.  I always find myself somewhat conflicted when it comes to issues of censorship, however.  In a perfect world, people could use morals and reason to guide their actions and no one would have to worry about media content.  But in this imperfect world, I have no issue with censorship laws that prohibit pornographic billboards, for example.  And children (minors) cannot take legal action against parents who put content filters on their computers and televisions…  Certainly a link could be made suggesting that Beijing sees itself in a parental capacity over its citizens.  And maybe some sites would be better off censored, but it’s more likely that the power to censor would corrupt more severely than the power to watch all kinds of trash on the Internet and television.  Censorship is like holding a tifet by the tail, I suppose.
An editorial note: it’s odd that you wrote about China saying, “But in the end, it is wrong to block content of any kind,” then followed it with commentary on your school policy: “Some limitations were reasonable…”
*censorship is like holding a TIGER by the tail. :)
BTW, GOOG may’ve done  the right thing this time, but it is becoming the next Microsoft, a worse one without Bill Gates. Losing China means you lose your biggest growth potential. GOOG has already stepped on too many people’s toe, and we all are waiting for the day it falls.
What does the title mean? Exposing the Chinese, the victims of internet censorship? What points do the writer and editors want to make? No wonder DT is becoming un-readable day by day. Such a bunch of incompetent xxx.
What in the world does Chinese censorship have to do with internet restrictions at your high school? i dont understand the point of this article

It thumps through the streets of Los Angeles like a sonic Godzilla — blaring from the cabs of rusty trucks waiting at stoplights and coming full-blast from our neighbor’s backyard quinceanera parties. But while the familiar umpa of traditional Mexican music has become the most prevalent of our city’s global soundtracks (so much that local white boy rock band the Bronx paid ode on its most recent album), it still remains largely ignored by mainstream music outlets.
Billboard calls it “Regional Mexican Music,” but that term would elicit “jajajas” from anyone in regional Mexico. Fans know it more affectionately as corridos, a poetic song form created in the 1800s that thrives today (thanks to a valiente named Chalino Sanchez) as politico-emotional border music. Readers of depressing news stories about “Mexico Under Siege” might be more familiar with the controversial sub-form narcocorridos, which were banned in Mexico last year for lyrics that reflect the country’s ongoing drug war.
But it is exactly because its subject matter wavers between cartel glorification and outcry against the border fence that there is much underground love for the corrido. The old musical folk tradition has been updated to speak to the identity of a new generation of Mexican-Americans and, for one day a year, it gets the ultimate Hollywood treatment.
Now in its third incarnation, the LiveNation-hosted Invasion del Corrido brings together the best crooners, players and bandas of the corrido and narcocorrido styles for a night of bailando y cantado at the Gibson Amphitheatre. This year’s lineup features Voz de Mando, El Potro de Sinaloa, Gerardo Ortiz, Cartel de Sinaloa, Enigma Norteno, Azabache and more.
Good luck finding tickets, though. Despite the event’s violent imagery (or maybe because of? The show’s flyer is covered in ammo-infused logos and one of the performing bands bears the name of a Mexican drug ring), the concert has been sold out for months.
Of course if low-key is more your corrido style (or $410 is too pricey for orchestra seats), hold out for a few weeks until Voz de Mando plays the unaffiliated-yet-similarly-titled event La Explosion del Corrido, which takes over at the Fox Theater in Pomona April 10. Or just hang out at your local major street intersection — a turned-up-to-11 ranchera-lover is sure to drive by.

For two USC athletes who have won countless Olympic medals, World Championship trophies, collegiate honors and nationwide praise for their athletic accomplishments, Rebecca Soni (swimming) and Jennifer Song (golf) are no strangers to award ceremonies and nomination announcements.
Nonetheless, two of USC finest student-athletes were chosen this week as two of 14 nominees for the 80th Annual AAU Sullivan Award, in recognition of the nation’s top amateur athlete.
Soni, a senior from Plainsboro, N.J., has the world record in the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke. In addition, she has represented the cardinal and gold more than admirably during her time as a Trojan, winning four straight NCAA championships in the 200-meter breaststroke, a record never accomplished by any other collegiate star.
While Soni may be at the top of her sport and en route to smashing a plethora of NCAA and world records, she has a very worthy champion joining her as the university’s premier representations of athletic excellence in sophomore Jennifer Song.
Although Song’s career has not lasted as long as Soni’s — the few short years she has been at USC have already placed her among Trojan lore.  In 2009, the Ann Arbor-native won the U.S. Women’s Amateur Public Links and the U.S. Women’s Amateur tournaments, which afforded her the right to play at the LPGA’s U.S. Open. Also, Song made history in her own right, becoming the first golfer in over two decades to win two U.S. Golf Association Championships in the same year.
The dynamic duo’s nominations mark the first year since 2005 in which USC is the only university with two athletes up for the amateur sports’ version of the Oscars. Soni and Song will be recognized at an April 14 ceremony at the New York Athletic Club, where the winner will also be announced.
Past winners of the award include Peyton Manning, Michael Phelps, Carl Lewis and Mark Spitz, to name a few.

Though the official transition period does not begin until April, Undergraduate Student Government officials are already working to train their successors and ensure continuity when the torch is passed to the new administration.
A recent amendment to the USG bylaws requires new senators to take a test on the responsibilities and processes required of their position. The test covers Senate meeting rules and bylaws.
Other positions do not have this test, so Vice President Ashlie Chan said she encourages the incoming officers to ask a lot of questions to be sure they understand their duties.
“For every other position, there are no tests or guidelines to measure if you’re ready to fulfill the position,” Chan said. “What they should do is that they should just ask questions so that they can have a smaller margin of error.”
Chan said that this year’s administration is taking particular care to make sure the transition is seamless.
“The main difference is that we’re trying to be as thorough as possible,” she said.
Chan said she transitioned easily into the vice presidential role because she had worked with USG before. She noted, however, that the process will vary by job.
“The responsibilities the vice president had were very familiar to me, so I think it was successful last year,” Chan said. “It depends on what position and what person you ask, but I think, overall we had that general consensus, and I just want to make sure that its very similar for this year, too.”
Some senator-elects said that it is difficult to come into the job without any USG experience.
Senator-elect Karen Tsai, a freshman, said although some newly elected senators have student government experience, many of them do not and can be confused about USG’s practices.
“Experience is really key,” Tsai said. “I think it would be helpful for the future senators to have knowledge about how things work.”
Sophomore William Wang, commuter senator-elect, agreed that the skills required for a senatorial position are learned with time. But he commended the current senate on its attitude about educating the new members.
“They’re very sociable, very open-minded and approachable, which cultivates our interest in the job,” Wang said. “They’re really helping us develop. They’re definitely doing everything they can to educate the new senate.”
The elected senators are currently attending Senate pre-meetings to find out more about their responsibilities. The current senators delegate their current business legislations and projects to the new senators so they will be able to continue those projects. The current senators are also working with Vice President-elect Nehi Ogbevoen to ensure that they understand his expectations.
“The old administration teaches us the key points in terms of how to write a resolution and best allocate your time,” Tsai said.
Residential Senator Tim Sae Koo said he thinks the transition process is going well, though he noted that a number of the new senators have been very shy.
“They don’t know what to expect a lot of times, they’re really quiet,” he said. “But they’re ambitious at the same time. They have the ability and mind-set to tackle the problems, so we really want to clear things up and tell them what their job is, which is to focus on their constituents and their problems and relay them back to USG.”
Another concern with the transition process is the continuation of in-progress projects. Though the current administration can make suggestions, the next administration usually tries to complete things that were listed on their platforms when they campaigned.
“Ultimately, it’s Chris and Nehi’s decision to finish the projects that they want and to start new ones that they’ve created themselves,” Chan said. “The projects that are lost in the transition are ones that they don’t want to pursue or are not feasible anymore … ones that are lost probably didn’t have a lot of weight or progress on them anyway.”
Some projects that Chan hopes the next administration will continue are improvements to the Lyon center, a new health center, security in the libraries, improvements for Campus Cruiser, heating lamps outside Trojan Grounds, making The Row a private street and extending Thanksgiving break, President-elect Chris Cheng said.
Chan said, although the people they work with will differ because of different availability of various administrators,  she and President Holden Slusher have compiled a list of administrators they have worked closely with and intend to pass it on to the next administration.
“I don’t think they are necessarily starting from scratch,” Chan said. “They are going to be able to go off of what USG has already established with its reputation.”
On top of one-on-one training, the old administration is putting all the important documents of each branch on flash drives so that they can reduce the possibility of losing files.
“The big focus that they have is to have a smooth transition,” Cheng said. “One thing that’s different is that they’re being a lot more sustainable — they’re digitizing everything. We were donated all these different thumb drives and everything is going on the thumb drives for the transition, instead of a transition folder or binder that can get lost.”
