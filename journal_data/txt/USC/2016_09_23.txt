For nearly four quarters on Friday at Rice-Eccles Stadium, it was a feel-good story: redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold was performing admirably in his first start and USC was in control against No. 24 Utah, on its way to a pivotal road win to correct a forgettable start to the season.
But it was 16 seconds too short. With time ticking down under a minute and USC up by 3 points, Utah quarterback Troy Williams dropped back at the 18-yard line and fired toward wide receiver Tim Patrick near the right pylon. And it was a slip by junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson — whose right shoe came off — allowing Patrick to make the game-winning catch.
“My shoe came off,” Jackson said. “Once I was breaking into the ball, my shoe just slipped off. When I tried to get up and play, I slipped again.”
And so it went. Instead of relishing in the rain coming down on a dreary, miserable night in Salt Lake City, the Trojans were left with a bitter 31-27 defeat, dropping them to 1-3 on the season.
USC entered the fourth quarter ahead 27-17, but Utes put together a touchdown drive early in the fourth to trim the deficit down to 3 points. With the help of a fourth down conversion in the red zone, Williams found Raelon Singleton for a leaping catch in the end zone.
On the ensuing drive, the Trojans made it into Utah territory, but opted to punt on fourth-and-three from the 37-yard line, pinning the Utes at their 7-yard line.
“When you don’t make [the first down], they’re literally two throws away from being in field goal range with a good field goal kicker,” head coach Clay Helton said. “I really trust our punter [redshirt sophomore Chris Tilbey]. He’s been unbelievable in these games, placing these balls and he did it again.”
But Utah marched 93 yards on 15 plays, eating up more than five minutes to clock to win the game, converting twice on fourth down in USC territory. A play after running back Zack Moss gained five yards on fourth down to USC’s 18-yard line, Williams delivered the strike to Patrick for the win.
Helton, who also opted to punt last week against Stanford in Cardinal territory despite trailing by 17 points in the fourth quarter, stuck to his philosophy again.
“To get a team down at the 5-yard line, you’ve got to trust your defense and I trust them,” he said. “I trust [defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast] and I trust this defense. I wouldn’t second-guess myself and I’d do it again.”
But it cost USC on Friday, as Utah took advantage of the possession.
“Their offense made plays,” sophomore linebacker Cameron Smith said. “Their receivers are big and tall and fast, and they were open a lot. It is what it is. I have nothing much to say. It’s a bummer.”
At least one player wanted to go for it on fourth down — junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who had a much-improved performance with eight catches for 98 yards.
“We all did,” he said on wanting to run a fourth-down play. “As offensive players, we have the momentum, we’re driving down. Whatever our coach’s decision is his call, I’m all for it too.”
The Trojans extended their lead out of halftime, as Darnold led them on an eight-play, 91-yard drive that culminated in a quarterback keeper for a touchdown. The drive involved a couple of well-thrown passes for big gains — one to redshirt senior tight end Taylor McNamara over the middle and the other to Smith-Schuster that drew a pass interference penalty deep in Utah territory.
But Utah responded with its own lengthy touchdown drive, which involved a trick play for a 28-yard gain into USC territory. On second and goal at the 1-yard line, Utah’s Armand Shyne fumbled in the end zone, but Isaac Asiata recovered it in the ensuing scrum for a touchdown to cut the lead back to seven.
An eventful first half featuring fumbles, kick returns and plenty of replay reviews ended with the Trojans up 17-10.
USC took its first lead late in the second quarter. The Trojans caught a break after Darnold appeared to fumble the ball in his own red zone, but it was ruled a forward pass and incompletion. On the next play, the Trojans took advantage as senior running back Justin Davis had a 50-yard run, and he completed the drive with a 14-yard touchdown to eclipse the 100-yard mark before halftime. The score put the Trojans ahead 14-10.
A defensive stop followed by a 36-yard field goal gave USC a touchdown lead into the locker room. Darnold threw for 130 yards on 10-of-17 passing in the half as the Trojans had more than double the time of possession as the Utes. He finished completing 18-of-26 passes for 253 yards and 44 yards rushing.
“You walk into a hostile environment like this on a rainy night and go out there and do what he did … I thought for a guy making his first start this is as good as you can hope for,” Helton said.
Offensive coordinator Tee Martin praised Darnold for his leadership.
“For me, listening upstairs from what he was saying on the sideline, he has this macho leadership about him, a sense of confidence,” Martin said. “I think the guys feed off that. I thought he did a good job of managing the offense and making plays too. There were some decisions out there that he made that was next-level type stuff.”
The Trojans’ defense was roughed up right away by the Utes’ rushing attack. Utah ran on 16 of its first 18 plays, including all 12 plays on the first drive. Williams finished it off with a 10-yard scamper to the left side for a touchdown to give Utah a 7-0 lead.
Jackson, though, answered quickly for USC, taking the ensuing kickoff 100 yards, blazing effortlessly past defenders to even the score. It was Jackson’s third career kickoff return and second of 100 yards, tying him with Anthony Davis for most in USC history.
USC struggled to take care of the ball, fumbling on its first three drives. In the first quarter, Davis fumbled near midfield and Darnold coughed up the ball on a quarterback run in the red zone to negate a promising drive. On the first drive of the second quarter, Jones was stood up on a third down play in Utah territory and also lost the football.
“We practiced all week with wet balls in practice,” Helton said. “You’ve got to have two arms on the ball.”
Be it turnovers, fourth down plays, coaching decisions or an ill-timed slip, USC had victory snatched from its grasp in a painful manner.
“I thought it was tonight,” Helton said on when he thought a turnaround would happen. “I’ll be honest with you. I really thought the attitude and competitiveness this team was playing with — I’m heartbroken for them.”
Davis expressed his disappointment, but looked ahead to USC’s next two games — at home against Arizona State and Colorado.
“This is one of the more tougher losses,” he said. “It really shows what kind of team you are to bounce back from this. I can’t remember the last time we started off the season this bad. It’s really up to the team to determine, find a way to get these next two wins at home.”
Mr. Swann,
Please save the USC Football program from all the damaged caused by Pat Haden. The NCAA sanctions pale in comparison to the self inflicted wounds that Pat has caused USC football.
A can’t miss coach is there, in Coach Tom Herman at the University of Houston. Coach Herman is a no nonsense coach and will instill discipline and fundamentals,which USC has lacked since Pete Carroll left. Coach Herman would instantly turn USC back into a national powerhouse.
Did I mention he is from Simi Valley?
Please do the right thing Mr. Swann. Save USC football from the disaster that your predecessor has created.
From a very concerned and dejected USC Alumnus.
John
Faith. Family. Football. Failure.

A short week for the USC Trojans takes them from Stanford to Utah in a six-day stretch. I carried with me all week the disappointment from Saturday’s loss to our bitter rivals in NorCal, but, as always, I welcomed a new game day with open arms.
A reflection on last Saturday’s game:
As harsh as it may sound, it’s safe to say the better team won. Stanford was fantastic all night as the Cardinal beat the Trojans by a decent margin. For the most part, USC was unimaginative and disorganized from the get-go. Every season, ‘SC is stacked with phenomenal athletes, but, without a greater sense of cohesion, all that talent will go nowhere. Stanford, on the other hand, was tough, fast, and played as a unit.
The Trojans were going to have to contain Christian McCaffrey, but were unable to do enough to slow him down. ‘SC gave up yards and momentum with pointless penalties and continued to seem confused and flustered at times. In order to have success in the league, let alone against Stanford, the Trojans are going to need greater discipline and situational awareness. Until we fix the tactical and mental discrepancies made obvious by last Saturday, the Trojans are not going to challenge in the Pac-12, as they should.
And now, a Friday-night game in Utah:
Utah is ranked, playing pretty well, and at home. Southern Cal’, on the other hand, is heading to a second road game in less than a week. In the time since the game in Palo Alto, however, the Trojans have been making some changes, the most notable of which is dropping Max Browne in favor of redshirt freshman quarterback, Sam Darnold. Darnold has looked good when he’s been on the field, and this is a great opportunity for him and for USC to turn the season around.  Utah’s journeyman quarterback, Troy Williams, will hope to make an impact after his own decent (but not incredible) start to the season.
This game could really go either way. The Trojans may be slightly favored simply because of the quality they have all over the field. Utah, however, is undefeated and will be fired-up for its first conference game of the season. There are a few keys things to look for in the game tonight. First of all, I am excited for Sam Darnold to get his first start. The fact that this comes against a good program in Utah should only give him added motivation. I’d like to see Darnold take charge of the Trojans’ offense early on and show the league what he can do. Next, the play-calling is going to be very important. Some of the plays against Stanford were either ineffective or poorly timed. That being said, I am very confident that Clay Helton and his coaching staff can hit the nail on the head against Utah. I wrote last week that I wanted to see an emphasis on the running game, and this holds true, but I hope we can find a balance and capitalize on holes in the defense rather than force a run in inopportune situations. Finally, I am begging that we can minimize the penalties. If USC is to be a powerhouse again, we need to stop offering up free yards to the other team; the best programs have the athleticism and organization, but also the discipline to be successful.
Anyway, a Friday away game is still an opportunity to cheer for the Trojans, and I intend to fight on, win or lose!

Los Angeles is a beautiful and terrifying city of lights and highways and poverty and glamour. People swarm here from all over the world to fulfill their dreams and realize their potential. Everybody is trying to make something of themselves. It can be so easy to get caught up in the chaos and to feel lost – to feel like an insignificant little human in the mob of millions. In this wonderful but sometimes impersonal city, Los Angelites need a place where they can go to interact on a genuine level with other people. We need something to remind us that we’re all connected, and we’re all here in this life, struggling and thriving through the same things together. November Project is that something for me.
In 2011, two friends in Boston, Brogan Graham and Bojan Mandaric, made a pact with each other to meet every day during the month of November at 6:30 AM in the morning to work out. Thus, November Project was born. What began as two friends motivating each other to work out through the coldest winter month became dozens of people meeting up once a week and encouraging each other to work hard. From there, November Project expanded and grew and is now a free fitness movement with groups (called “tribes”) meeting in 31 different cities all across the world every single Wednesday of the year. 
The unique and beautiful thing about the November Project is that although it is essentially a platform for people to have challenging, fun workouts, it is also so much more than that. When I arrived at the November Project at the Hollywood Bowl for the first time, it was my first week living in Los Angeles and I was still feeling intimidated by the fervor of the city. That morning, I saw a different side of L.A. I was greeted with hugs from everyone I encountered, encouragement, and the most genuinely welcoming and enthusiastic community that I have ever witnessed. I felt it; These are my kind of people. 
It’s impossible to properly describe the energy of the November Project. It is a truly incredible group of exuberant, loving, encouraging people. It is a group that forces you to push your physical limits. It is a safe haven and a strong community for anybody who makes the effort to show up. It is the perfect pocket of positivity and authenticity within the crazy Hollywood world.

The weather may not be cold enough to pull out that sweater or those new thigh-high boots you bought, but one thing that is guaranteed this fall is some good Netflix and chill material. 
If you’re anything like me, going out after a long week of classes and work sometimes is just not the move. Whether it’s to save a dollar or just spend some quality time on your couch, trading in a face of makeup at a party for a face mask at home is always satisfying. And tonight, your girl will most definitely be rocking hers after the whirlwind I experienced working at the Emmys – the award show for television series. If you’re just joining the Sips Tea family, I work at a fashion PR agency where we style A list celebrities every day (yes, sometimes even on the weekends). Let’s just say our office looked like a trendy tornado came through and left piles of designer dresses in its wake. 
So now that the showroom and I are in recovery mode, let’s get into my list of the best binge-watching material coming soon to a TV (or laptop) near you. 
Having just binge-watched season two, I can confidently tell you that this show is a must-watch for many reasons. One, it satisfies any urge you’ve ever had to “fight the man.” Two, it’s written, directed, and produced by the same person which makes for consistent edge-of-your-seat-worthy storylines. Three, Rami Malek just won “Best Lead in a Drama Series,” beating out Kevin Spacey in House of Cards. For those of you that are familiar, you know that’s a pretty big deal. 
If you’d rather just sit down and enjoy something a little more light-hearted but still with a plot twist every now and then, you might want to pencil Jane the Virgin into your next free four-hour slot. With season three returning to The CW in October, it’s a perfect time to get updated on this soap opera-esque TV show that features a love triangle, an evil twin, and a lot of baby mama drama. Plus, the show is half in spanish, half in english (with subtitles don’t worry), so you might even pick up a few new vocabulary words here and there if you don’t already speak spanish. 
Empire returned this past Wednesday with a bang,  and it looks like this season is going to be another eventful one. Now, I mainly watch the show for Cookie because I think she is my alter ego to a T, but if the series gets a little too theatrical for you, I highly suggest watching Power. It’s essentially the more raw director’s cut version that features a better storyline and even more conniving characters. 
You know Shonda Rhimes (a former Trojan) never fails, so my fourth suggestion for your next Netflix and chill session is any one of her many shows. This woman owns thursdays so add it to your planner if you haven’t already and get your wine ready. How To Get Away With Murder holds a special place in my heart because the show has been filmed many times on campus. Gotta support the Trojan fam!
If you’re already a fan of the Walking Dead franchise, then its spin off series Fear The Walking Dead will not disappoint. Having started this series with my boyfriend, I would suggest that you cuddle up with someone you’ve been crushing on or dating and enjoy a marathon of zombies together. What a perfect way to get closer (literally). I will admit I have jumped now and then because the show features many surprises, but it’s not limited to the frights. The plot is also on point. 
Hopefully the weather gets its act together, because I’ve been waiting to bust out my “come-up” coat for too long. Although it’s not October yet, these shows are all treats, not tricks.

If the average college student doesn’t have an internship or job, isn’t involved in numerous organizations on campus, doesn’t get less than seven hours of sleep, and isn’t expected to complete 200 plus pages of reading per week, then is he really a college student?
The fact that the American educational system is not what it was fifty years ago is self-evident. It is not enough nowadays to get a bachelor’s degree and land a job the next day. Employers expect more than just a 4.0 GPA on your resume. This translates into jobs, extracurriculars, leadership roles, volunteer work, and the list goes on. While professors are well aware of this situation, they choose to set unrealistic expectations in their classrooms regarding coursework and reading material.
The inevitable result? Skimming. Skimming through hundreds of pages of reading, glancing up and down paragraphs, highlighting topic sentences and perusing the page for keywords. It’s a deadly habit that college students have perfected over the years (it should be listed as one of the soft skills on our resumes). When professors are approached with this problem by their students their response is, “Well, it’s an upper division course. What did you expect?” 
Naturally. 
Because a student who is taking three or four upper division courses should expect to have a hundred pages of reading per class every week, on top of writing assignments and projects.
With the amount of coursework students are required to complete, it becomes impossible to fully absorb and retain the information in their textbooks. This defeats the whole purpose of learning –– if students cannot commit enough time to their studies and must resort to flipping through pages of dense reading, how are they expected to comprehend the subject material and have a holistic understanding of their courses?
With the rising cost of college tuition in the U.S., students are feeling the pressure of their impending loans and increasing student debt. Some are forced to take on multiple jobs, and on top of an internship and their studies, the workload may seem infinite. This flawed educational system has become so pervasive it breeds a culture of overworked and sleepless students, swamped with so many responsibilities that they can no longer decide what to prioritize. 
College is supposed to be a time of creativity, of mental and emotional development. Earning a degree means mastering a subject you’ve chosen to dedicate four years of your life to, and using that knowledge to propel you into your field of work. Yet students are skimming through college, receiving a surface level and cursory understanding of their courses. 
Your studies should come first, because, after all, isn’t that what you’re taking out all those loans for? If we are expected to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to these institutions and graduate with a heaping amount of debt, then it is only fair to be given a proper education. I want the full college experience, not the abridged version.

College is really a factory imo. You got students who know how to game it, whether it be cheating, being good test takers, colluding with other cheaters, teacher’s pet, etc. Then you got students who are honest, which sadly are a minority, and they do put in sincere effort. I talked to various students when I was a student. And what I quickly learned was that the majors that supposedly land promising careers, such as law, medicine, engineering, business, are mandated by their respective departments, and professional industries, to be hard because, by virtue of supply and demand, you can’t give everyone a shot in those respective areas. You can’t have indifferent people, who just want to get by, be given crucial positions. But unfortunately, that happens a lot more than we think. 
For uselessology degrees….I don’t think GPA or an intense expertise of the subject is necessary. Besides, people who hold uselessology degrees usually just pursue administrative jobs…that don’t necessarily require college degrees. These organizations just prefer them because college grads can pick up new information and learn things at a more efficient rate than non-college people. And the organization has a professional polish if it hires college grads.
