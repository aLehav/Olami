Legal scholar and economist Andrew Guzman will serve as USC’s next provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, President Carol Folt announced in a Universitywide email Tuesday morning.
Guzman, who has served as dean of the Gould School of Law for eight years and who currently serves as interim dean of USC Libraries, will start in his new position July 1. 
His appointment follows former provost Charles Zukoski’s resignation effective Jan. 1. The Board of Trustees voted unanimously in 2018 to appoint Zukoski to the role, and Folt did not provide a reason for his sudden step down after she announced it in November. 
Interim Provost Elizabeth Graddy filled in the post while the Provost Search Committee, composed of faculty, staff, students and USC stakeholders, sought a permanent replacement.
Gaurav Sukhatme, a professor of computer science and electrical and computer engineering, chaired the committee, which was tasked — alongside executive search firm Isaacson, Miller — with advising Folt on the appointment of the next provost. 
Sukhatme said the University put forth a “very comprehensive” description of the position and its required qualifications.
“Somebody who could raise the academic profile of the University is very important, and somebody who could promote a diverse and equitable and inclusive environment that celebrated all of USC’s strengths for students’ success,” Sukhatme said in an interview with the Daily Trojan Tuesday. 
The committee sought a senior leader who could contribute to a responsive campus climate, prioritize the hiring of top faculty with attention to diversity, and bolster the student experience and academic core of the University, Sukhatme said.
In her email Tuesday, Folt lauded Guzman’s achievements during his tenure as Gould dean, including the expansion of clinical learning, the advancement of diversity in legal education and practice, and the strengthening of Gould’s financial position. Under his leadership, the school introduced multidisciplinary master’s and certificate programs, and launched one of the first bachelor’s degrees in legal studies in the country. Guzman became the first Latino to hold that deanship.
“His leadership of the Gould School of Law has been fantastic,” Sukhatme said. “Student achievement and student success in the Gould School of Law has been just really remarkable: just the kind of the entering J.D. classes, the kind of faculty he’s been able to recruit.”
The positions Guzman’s promotion leaves vacant will be filled by Franita Tolson, a professor of law who will step into the role of interim Gould dean, and Marje Schuetze-Coburn, associate dean of faculty affairs and librarian who will serve as the USC Libraries’ interim dean.
Guzman holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School and a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University. He previously served as a professor of law and associate dean for international and advanced programs at the UC Berkeley Law School. Guzman has written two books about international law and has edited several collected works. 
Graddy, Guzman and Folt did not respond to the Daily Trojan’s request for comment in time for publication.

For some reason, it initially surprised me that America is undergoing a cultural regression in 2023. Call me naive for believing that we live in a place and time that would no longer attempt to legally restrict, repress and confine the careers of entertainers and performers. I thought that boldly villainizing artists was something left for the conversations among conservative conspiracy theorists — harmful sure, but ultimately taken lightly because, hey, who’s really listening to them anyway? 
I could not have been more wrong. 
According to The Guardian, in February, Tennessee was the first state to pass a law banning what they named “adult cabaret performances,” specifically in public property and places where performers might be viewed by children. Drag entertainers are the true targets, as revealed by the law prohibiting male or female impersonators, with the threat of a misdemeanor or felony for violating this law. 
However, a federal judge in Tennessee recently blocked the bill temporarily, stating that the legislation was too “vague” and “overly-broad,” halting the bill from going into effect. 
We can breathe a temporary sigh of relief; however, the message is still loud and clear: The art of drag is still being besmirched and misunderstood. After all, 18 states nationwide seek to restrict or outlaw drag performances. Even with the rising popularity and exposure of the art, drag is still falsely reduced to and represented as a promiscuous, unnecessary danger. 
What’s more, these laws can potentially ruin the livelihoods of these entertainers. With drag being a full-time career for many entertainers, these bills would put not just individuals, but businesses at risk. 
With these harmful narratives potentially destroying means of income, they also simultaneously target visibility. Continued anti-LGBTIA+ sentiment fuels the homophobic and transphobic fire that must be extinguished — particularly for trans people.
Now, more than ever, we must acknowledge and recognize drag’s rich history and vitality as a performance art. Drag queens have been pioneers for gay rights and activism for years, spearheading social justice movements and marches while uniting LGBTIA+ underground spaces. 
Drag queens today are finally getting the recognition and following they deserve. The successes of long standing drag and gay bars like Barracuda Lounge, Catch One — back when Jewel Thais-Williams owned it — and Hell’s Kitchen attest to the importance and popularity of drag in the community. 
Additionally, drag has undoubtedly surpassed the bar and club spaces. I couldn’t write this article without mentioning RuPaul’s Drag Race. While the show has its flaws regarding “fan servicing” drag and creating questions on the authenticity of the art, it is undeniable that RuPaul has forever changed expectations on what drag can embody. From the show, queens are now selling out theaters and going on tours like Werq the World, walking on runways like the Savage X Fenty Show, appearing in music videos, hosting talk shows, performing on Broadway — the list is quite literally endless. 
Drag is alive and well. Conservatives attempting to stifle these entertainers only emphasize their lack of education and knowledge of the art. Two-time Drag Race winner and Broadway actress Jinkx Monsoon addressed drag’s resilience in an interview with MSNBC. 
“To the people trying to oppress my community right now … look what’s happened every time you’ve tried to oppress a community in America … you tried to oppress women, women got the vote,” Monsoon said. “You tried to oppress people of color, we’re not accepting that anymore … There are places where it’s safe to be queer, or a drag queen or trans at any age, and there are places in this country where it’s not … We need you with us to keep fighting for our freedoms and liberties and equalities.”
Drag has never been about corrupting children or pushing sexual agendas onto young people; it was born out of resistance, entertainment and self-expression. 
I pay $10 a month for the Sibling Rivalry podcast, featuring Bob The Drag Queen and Monét X Change, and I attend local drag shows nearly every week. Last year, I spent more than $300 at DragCon — not including the VIP ticket — and this year, I interned for the annual USC Drag Show. These falsified narratives of drag could not be farther from the truth, and I am proud to say there is much more to the art than meets the eye.
I firmly believe that introducing children to drag benefits all parties involved. Queens are some of the best people to teach young people universal lessons like confidence and the importance of acceptance. Programs like Drag Queen Story Hours provide children with an educational environment that exposes them to a new culture while keeping a fun and colorful atmosphere. 
We must continue advocating for visibility for these multi-faceted, talented entertainers. Attend a drag brunch, see a local girl at a bar or go to a drag bingo night. Whatever it may be, keeping drag prominent and supported is one of the easiest ways to combat attempts to outlaw it.

Our current relationship with the environment possesses an inherent dichotomy. It could be argued that a core American value is the appreciation of Earth’s natural beauty as the United States is often listed as one of the world’s most naturally beautiful nations. 
Patriotic anthems boast spacious skies above fruited plains from sea to shining sea, and the U.S. became the first country to establish national parks to preserve wondrous landscapes in 1872. However, alongside an ostensible pride in this imagery seems to lie a concerning acceptance of its destruction. According to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, the U.S. is responsible for nearly a third of both the world’s energy consumption and carbon emissions — a disheartening disproportionality considering that U.S. citizens make up only 5% of the world’s population. 
Earth Month might be an example of this duplicity. Only observed by 20 million people upon its creation, Earth Day began in 1970 by former Wisconsin Senator Gaylor Nelson. Being influenced by youth protests and the publication of Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring,” Earth Day expanded over the subsequent decades through technological mobilization and expanding legislation — many of which were spearheaded by Nelson himself. 
Today, more than 1 billion people across the globe celebrate Earth Day as a “day of action to change human behavior and create global, national, and local policy changes,” according to the holiday organization’s official mission statement. 
The U.S. has spearheaded the largest secular observance on the planet and dedicated it to preserving its resources. However, these efforts still seem to exist in an unproductive cycle. The average American emits about 16 tons of carbon. Compared to the emissions of other large countries such as China’s seven and the United Kingdom’s six, our celebration of Earth Day seems nothing more than a facade. 
While most environmental damage is perpetrated by flawed public policies and corporations prioritizing profit, that doesn’t absolve the work we as individuals need to do to reduce our impact. Saying that individual actions are not significant enough to make a change is a thin excuse. If enough humans move as a collective and do even these simple things that benefit the environment, transformation is possible. 
Studies have shown that something as simple as turning the lights off when you leave a room can reduce carbon emissions by more than 5 million tons. Light pollution is a major source of carbon emissions, and 35% of light usage is wasted per year. In the U.S., 15 million tons of carbon dioxide are released per year from residential lighting, an amount that would need 600 million new trees to purify. Switching to motion sensors and LED lights, or simply following the common rule of switching off the lights if you’re leaving an area for more than 15 minutes, could result in a drastic and profound change. 
Another simple, sustainable act is to sort your trash properly. Trojans have unequivocal resources to implement recycling and composting in their lives and save 904 kilograms of carbon per person each year at no additional cost. Taking the extra 30 seconds to allocate your waste into landfill, recycling and compost — bins for all three are now available in residential dorms — reduces the demand for environmentally unsustainable manufacturing and decreases the amount of trash spilled into our landfills and oceans. If all 49,000 Trojans reduce, reuse and recycle, USC alone would reduce carbon emissions by 48,800 tons annually. Nationally, we could see that number rise to over 33 million. 
Finally, the Wednesday Farmers Market in McCarthy Quad is a great place to begin sustainable purchasing. With Los Angeles being a mega-hub of small businesses, buying locally could reduce carbon emissions by up to 17%. 
For example, according to research by Stanford University, the average meal has traveled up to 25,000 miles with out-of-season produce transported from Africa and Europe. Cargo ships commonly used to import these goods produce 10 to 40 grams of CO2 per kilometer. Try purchasing clothing or furniture from a thrift store rather than ordering from Shein or Amazon and avoid agricultural corporations like Hood or Driscoll’s. These swaps have the additional benefits of encouraging sustainable production and deterring labor exploitation, animal abuse and chemical agriculture. American dairy farmers have even collectively agreed to become a carbon-neutral industry by 2050. All we have to do is support them in their efforts.
The time has come for us to redefine our approach to sustainability. Earth Month is a precious period because it reminds us of our responsibility to protect the planet that we pride ourselves on. We need to sustain this interest regularly and let it take some priority in the way we live our lives. We can only hope that through doing this, Earth Day transforms from a day of action to a day of celebration rather than a day of mourning the decay of our planet.

When MSCHF revealed its “Big Red Boots,” it took the internet by storm. Not only was the fashion world gagging over it — in both a good and bad way — but meme culture quickly took over, comparing it to the boots worn by Boots in “Dora the Explorer” and “Astro Boy.”
When contemplating how the boot became so popular to the point that it was sold out within the day, I have to give credit where credit is due: MSCHF teased the shoe at the perfect time. 
Giving the internet just over a week before its Feb. 16 launch, MSCHF co-founder Daniel Greenberg knew that the “cartoonish abstraction of a shoe” would quickly go viral. Further implementing marketing tactics by releasing the editorial photos of the shoes being styled, along with various fashion influencers debuting them on their personal feeds, meant that after launch day, the only way to snag a pair is through StockX and pleading with pricey resellers. 
I wondered how the boot would be replicated, though — and if it could be at all. Just as fast fashion companies like Shein and retail giants like Urban Outfitters blatantly copy small designers and emerging trends at vastly cheaper prices, shoe companies like Jeffrey Campbell and Steve Madden have had a history and found similar success by following this copy-cat model. Still, though, Campbell and Madden’s shoes were traditional — not massive, clunky, “Super Mario”-tube-portal resembling boots. 
I was quickly proven wrong when I was sent Danny Kabouni’s TikTok, where he 3D prints his own pair of MSCHF boots. He scaled another user’s 3D print of the shoe to 700% — since the original creator, bigovereasy, used dimensions for his fingers — and used thermoplastic polyurethane filament instead of polylactic acid to mimic the flexible nature of the actual shoe. The total print time ended up being 12 days per boot, but they were, surprisingly, completely wearable. 
Obviously, in the grand scheme of this, it is much cheaper to shell out $350 for the boots or, rather, $500 and upward for the current resale value, than it is to buy a 3D printer and printing material. But, for people who have access to a 3D printer, what does this mean for the future of fashion and everyday items in general? 
Most likely, the end of large supply and retail giants. But, as humans, we can be lazy. That’s part of the appeal of shopping — the fact that it’s already there, fully assembled for us. But, then, if we all just saved money to purchase 3D printers and printing supplies instead of buying a new shirt or sneakers, what’s stopping us from creating our own products, and even selling them? The first is that we can’t 3D print everything. Plastic and filaments are not ample nor viable substitutions for cotton, satin and metal. But a second, more technical answer, is the law. 
While under the umbrella of intellectual property and IP theft, did you know fashion lawyers exist? It’s even a program at Fordham University.
In fact, fashion lawsuits constantly happen right under our noses, they’re just not as closely followed, except by people who are invested in the industry as some sort of stakeholder or just really care about fashion. While it’s understandable, as these lawsuits don’t affect our lives the way that the overturning of Roe v. Wade or Brown v. Board of Education did, they’re still fascinating to look at.  
One of the recent major cases was Adidas v. Thom Browne, in which Adidas attempted to sue Thom Browne for $8 million in damages after claiming that Browne’s use of stripes and high prices would confuse and deter customers away from Adidas. On Jan. 12, the court ruled in favor of Browne. Adidas then filed an appeal Feb. 9 to try and get the verdict reversed, with its spokesperson telling Forbes that the company “will continue to ‘vigilantly enforce’ its ‘intellectual property.’” 
Another major case: Hermès v. Mason Rothschild’s MetaBirkins, in which the jury ruled in favor of Hermès, awarding the company $133,000 in damages. Claiming that the NFTs were diluting the “luxury brand’s trademark” and status that came with the elusive Birkin, the jury actually decided based on the NFTs failing a test that determines whether or not they could be considered art. 
But why do we even bother with filing lawsuits if we’re living in an age of increased repetition, such as in 3D rendering and IP theft?
Part of this stems from the purpose of trademarks, patents and copyrights. All serve to protect, but do so in different ways and serve different purposes. Trademarks are reserved for a word, phrase or design, or a combination, that distinguishes a company’s good or service from others to avoid customer confusion to further brand reputation and name-brand associations. Patents are for new and useful compositions that are highly unique or vastly improve an already existing product — but, they can’t be utilitarian (generic). Copyrights protect intellectually created works that are original and exist in a tangible medium but serve to protect against copying. 
It is up to companies to take the correct course of action to secure their name, idea or product, and to do so in an appropriate manner. While expiration dates and renewals may need to occur before the product or brand becomes big, early action may prevent being steamrolled by corporate giants. 
But by enforcing this legal system — and truly, in having a legal system at all — we can continue to attempt to enforce a life of peace, respect, empathy, and nurturing for creativity and humankind. 
It is impossible to expect people to live on a purely honor-based system, and it would be naive to believe an entire nation could do so — even though we all have that one friend who is genuinely too pure for the world. 
I believe that while rules are meant to guide and redirect rather than restrict and scare, sometimes it’s good to know the limitations — whether this means throwing your pet bottles in the correct bin or thinking of a product and finding it already exists upon further research. It forces you to think differently and pivot, which are skills we need to continue to hone as we grow older and challenges feel grander in scale. 
The world doesn’t require a majority of the population to create change. It can always start with one thought or one idea, so why not make it one that’s original?

Popular musicals like “Miss Saigon,” “South Pacific” and “The King and I” have long been lauded for adding diversity to Broadway. However, taking a closer look reveals that these shows are steeped in stereotypes: Yellowface and exoticism take center stage, reducing Asian characters to their racial identity. Currently, in the wake of surging anti-Asian racism, media representation continues to be an important issue, which made it a timely topic for Visions and Voices’ event, “Dismantling Orientalism: This is Not a True Story.”
Visions and Voices hosted Asian American theater practitioners and scholars at the USC Pacific Asia Museum Friday for a conversation and staged reading centered around dismantling Orientalism. Orientalism is a theory — popularly critiqued by Edward Said — that analyzes how Western media portrays the East, or the so-called “Orient,” through a colonialist lens. 
Roski professor Jenny Lin moderated the discussion on Asian American media representation and dismantling Orientalism, which featured School of Dramatic Arts and Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences professor Rena Heinrich, UC Riverside professor Donatella Galella and Artists at Play Director Reena Dutt.
“Orientalism is a lens through which the West looks at, understands and tries to contain the East. The West knows itself by what it is not, and it holds the East and the West in a binary,” Heinrich said. “So, if the West is strong, then the East is weak. If the West is rational, the East is irrational. If the West is masculine, then the East is feminine.”
The effects of this theory can be seen in popular media featuring Asian characters, including the opera Madama Butterfly and the musical based on it “Miss Saigon.”
“[‘Miss Saigon’] completely ignores and actually romanticizes the colonialism of the United States,” Galella said. “It’s like a tragedy and we’re moved to tears. And that’s actually kind of what’s so seductive and pernicious about it, that it tugs at our hearts strings. We think it’s beautiful, right?”
The panel applauded the recent success of Asian American films, such as “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” but championed the need for more representation. Galella cited the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative’s study on portrayals of Asian Pacific Islanders in film, which found that only about 3% of top grossing movies from 2007 to 2019 had an APIA lead or co-lead. Out of these 44 films, 14 of them starred Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.
“Inevitably and naturally, we tend to reproduce things and re-consume things and show these films over and over to the next generation. So we need more, and we need to change the narrative,” Galella said. “I feel really lucky that I could show my kid ‘Turning Red,’ for example. I didn’t have that growing up.”
Dutt added that bringing theater into education could help break the cycle of undervaluing the arts. 
“If a child grows up with theater in their world, they’re going to become patrons, which is going to fund the theater, which is then going to provide the opportunity to tell more diverse stories,” Dutt said. “That’s what we do in the theater. We educate people through storytelling. But everything’s kind of integrated, right? There has to be a seed planted very young in order for it to be important.”
In practice, dismantling Orientalism looks like creating safe spaces for Asian American artists in theater and film that do not tokenize their racial identity. 
“A lot of my work is just having conversations with producers, executives and artistic leaders for, ‘Why can’t I tell an American story that doesn’t have anything to do with South Asia?’” Dutt said. “‘Why can’t I tell a story about a girl from North Carolina?’ Because I’m from North Carolina. [We have to prove] why we are actually part of the American diaspora.”
The conversation was followed by a staged reading of “This is Not a True Story,” a new play by Preston Choi that interrogates the trope of the tragic Asian woman in theater and blurs the lines between fiction and reality.
The play centers around three characters: Cio-Cio from “Madama Butterfly,” Kim from “Miss Saigon” and Takako/Kumiko, who is loosely based on the protagonist of “Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter.” Choi’s writing flips the stereotypes of Orientalism on its head. The three become stuck in a time loop, and Kumiko must explain to the other two women that they are fictional characters subject to the prejudices of the men who wrote them.
“[The play] is like I’m going to take what you have and give it back to you in a way that, hopefully, you’ll see just how ridiculous [the stereotype] is and blown out of proportion,” Choi said.
Choi’s “This is Not a True Story” is a prime example of dismantling Orientalism while lifting up new Asian American voices. 
“I just met Preston and I was like, ‘Oh my goodness, I’m so excited to meet you because you’ve been winning all these awards.’ I’ve been excited to see this play for years now, ever since Artists at Play announced it. So I just seek those out and it feeds me,” Galella said. “So, that’s what you do. You find the folks making stories and then you feed off of it to stay alive as a way to preserve yourself.”

It’s getting to be that time of the year, just before finals, where burnout is starting to happen. Spring break wasn’t enough to fully get us out of the mid-semester slump; The bed is harder to get out of, going to class seems like way too much work and summer can’t come soon enough. 
Here’s the good news: You’re almost at the finish line. To help you cross it, here are some of the most iconic new releases of the month to kick your legs back to during a well-earned study break or when you’re procrastinating that next big assignment:
Netflix
“BEEF” Season 1 — April 6
There’s no better way to kick off the beginning of April than with a new A24 comedy series, and one that’s been named an “early contender for the best-of-the-year lists” by The Guardian. Steven Yeun (“Minari”) and Ali Wong (“Always Be My Maybe”) play Danny Cho and Amy Lau, whose road rage altercation leads them down a path of revenge and brings out their “darkest impulses.” 
Knowing independent studio A24’s fearless track record exploring the eccentric and weird, like with its iconic multi-Oscar winning film “Everything Everywhere All At Once” (2022), this show is sure to shape up into something audiences will savor. 
“Better Call Saul” Season 6 — April 18
It’s finally here — the highly anticipated season finale of the hit stand-alone show based on the TV series “Breaking Bad” is coming this month. The story follows criminal defense attorney Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) six years before he notoriously represented Albuquerque’s most infamous drug lord Walter White and became better known as “Saul Goodman.”  
In this series, Goodman is a small-time lawyer aiming to make a name for himself. The series follows his journey as he navigates his morals and the criminal underworld. Packed with action, high stakes and characters you’ve been rooting for since “Breaking Bad”’s premiere in 2008, the finale is bound to have you at the edge of your seat.
“Sweet Tooth” Season 2 — April 27
Following a two-year break, the long-awaited fantasy and drama series is finally continuing after the first season ended on a scathing cliff-hanger. Based on the comic by Jeff Lamire, the Netflix original series is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious virus has wiped out most of humanity and left behind hybrid children, including part-deer, part-human main character, Gus (Christian Convery). 
The show follows Gus as he leaves behind his home in the forest in search of answers about the new world, the mystery behind the virus and his own hybrid origins. Avid watchers of the show when it initially premiered might want to rewatch the first season before this next one comes out. And, if you haven’t seen it already, now’s your perfect chance.
HBO Max
“Barry” Season 4 — April 16
You heard it right — the Emmy award-winning dark comedy series is coming to an end with an eight-episode fourth season to tie up the highly-acclaimed show. Created by Alec Berg and Bill Hader, the show follows depressed hitman Barry Berkman (Hader) who travels to Los Angeles to carry out a kill, but finds himself joining an acting class taught by the endearing Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler). Smitten with actress Sally (Sarah Goldberg). He becomes passionate about acting, he decides to leave his crime life behind, but getting away from a life as a hitman to pursue a new one is a lot harder than he thought. We’ve got three — and soon four — seasons to prove it.
Amazon Prime
“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” Season 5 — April 14
“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” is the jackpot of Prime Video’s streaming schedule. Written and directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino, creator of “Gilmore Girls,” the original series set in the ’50s and ’60s features Miriam “Midge” Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan), a housewife living in New York City who discovers she has a special talent for stand-up comedy. The witty writing and colorful setting make for an unskippable show that will have you rooting for Maisel as she navigates her relationships and her career in the male-dominated world of comedy.
Hulu
“Saint X” Season 1 – April 26
Last but not least, “Saint X” is another series set to premiere at the end of this month and is one of the most anticipated shows coming to Hulu. The platform is no stranger to book-to-movie adaptations, and this psychological drama is no different. 
Based on the novel of the same name by Alexis Schaitkin, the story revolves around a young woman who dies during a family vacation to the Caribbean and her younger sister, who digs for answers years later. Told through multiple timelines and perspectives, the series aims to turn the “missing girl” trope on its head with twists and turns. If you’re looking for a heavy show that will leave your head spinning, mark your calendars for April 26.

Some classes in the Seeley G. Mudd Building were recently canceled due to the ceiling’s instability following heavy rainstorms in Los Angeles. Repair work took place Saturday to replace ceiling tiles, Facilities Planning and Management wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan, and the whole roof will be replaced this coming summer.
In one case, the ceiling fell in, resulting in visible holes in the ceiling and rubble in the trash cans placed underneath to collect the debris. The more general issue is ceiling’s leakage, especially when it rains.
“[I’m] a little insecure and nervous about the integrity of the roof,” said Connor Castro, a sophomore majoring in psychology. “I [just] got to walk around the trash cans that hold the water from the leaks, and there’s a whole bunch of them, especially on the second story around the labs … There’d be puddles on the floor sometimes when they don’t have a trash can.”
Dylan Overby, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, said the leaks in the ceilings have interfered with students going about their day-to-day lives.
“I’ve seen people who usually sit in the corner not be able to sit there,” Overby said.  “A lot of people are just scooted over. It doesn’t really affect me, because I don’t sit in that area.”
Overby said he’d noticed that the building’s ceilings had been an issue prior to the recent rainstorms that brought 6.23 inches of rain to downtown L.A. in the month of March, resulting in floods and power outages. 
“I first noticed [the leaky ceilings] last semester because we had a section of the classroom cut out because no one could sit there,” Overby said. “This semester, there has been a chair and there’s just been dripping water on it the entire semester.”
Castro, who took classes in the same room in SGM for three consecutive semesters, said that the ceiling has been leaking for around a year. He said ceilings caving in, though, is a relatively new issue.
A sophomore majoring in pharmacology and drug development, Colin Nguyen compared the state of Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences buildings — including SGM — to newer, more well-kept ones, such as Wallis Annenberg Hall.
“Since I’ve been a freshman here, I was so fascinated by how beautiful and how nice Annenberg and Marshall [buildings] were,” Nguyen said. “I was like, ‘Whoa, how come we don’t get this at SGM or at Kaprielian Hall in the basement?’”
Nguyen said he feels as though there is “always something wrong” with Dornsife buildings. There seems to constantly be construction occurring around them, he said, which he doesn’t see happening at other schools. Nguyen said he’s surprised that Dornsife supposedly “[doesn’t] get that much funding compared to Annenberg or Marshall” especially considering that Dornsife has the greatest undergraduate student population out of all the schools at USC.
“I almost never study in … any Dornsife building,” Nguyen said. “I normally study in Annenberg or Marshall because the facilities — and obviously the roofs and the infrastructure — are a lot nicer. I felt like there can be a lot more done to make the [Dornsife] buildings more hospitable, more comfortable, more conducive to studying, especially in places like SGM.” 
When the Daily Trojan inquired about Dornsife’s funding, the school said it “has the support of the university for the resources needed to serve our students, faculty and staff.” School-specific financial reports are not publicly accessible.

Santa Catalina Island, the native-land-turned-tourist-destination renowned for its scenic charm, is now a collection point of the largest accumulation of ocean plastic in the world. Located between Hawaii and California, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers an estimated surface area of 618,000 square miles — an area three times the size of France — and contains approximately 80,000 tons of plastic. 
Amid ongoing multi-million-dollar cleanup efforts, researchers at the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies, located on the island, wondered if they could turn the trash into something useful.
“It was a huge and urgent problem,” said Travis Williams, a professor of chemistry. “I’ve been looking at this for several years, and I came to the conclusion that there’s never going to be a chemistry solution to this [issue].”
As such, in collaboration with Clay Wang, a professor and chair of the Department of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Williams and his team aimed to develop a chemical reaction that would degrade plastic into something that microorganisms could use. Consequently, the two labs devised a two-stage method incorporating chemical and biocatalytic methods that could transform post-consumer mixed plastics into antibiotics, immunosuppressants and other valuable products.
Their paper, published in Angewandte Chemie in November, announced the successful application of the two-stage method to polyethylene — one of the most common categories of plastics, used in products like plastic bags or food packaging — from which they were able to derive pharmacologically active compounds, manufacturing materials and other products in bulk quantities.
“Polyethylenes are one of the most widely used plastics. It is also the hardest sort to crack owing to the chemical structure of it,” said Chris Rabot, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Wang’s lab. 
To test the efficacy of the upcycling method for polyethylene, multiple student and social organizations, including Boy Scouts of America and students from the Bridge Undergraduate Science Program, collected unprocessed plastic waste from Catalina Harbor as samples for the study, including plastic shopping bags, milk cartons and carryout containers. In the laboratory, researchers then broke down the samples with chemical catalysts and pressurized oxygen to produce diacids, which they dubbed “fungus food.”
Upon feeding engineered strains of Aspergillus nidulans — a versatile, tractable species of fungus used by labs across the world in drug discoveries — with the diacids as a carbon source, the strains produced a significant amount of antibiotics, cholesterol-lowering statins, immunosuppressants and antifungals within a week.
The two-stage method also indicated staggering efficiency during the upcycling process. In the lab, 83% of low-density polyethylene and 54% of mixed ocean plastic is recovered as identifiable fungus food.
“Those are really big numbers when you talk about what are the things we are able to do with ocean plastic,” Williams said.
Given the huge volume of polyethylene found in marine debris and the unsatisfactory recycling rate, the success of upcycling polyethylene is illuminating the same process for other kinds of plastics. Another paper by Williams’ team, published in February in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, tweaked the two-stage method used for polyethylene and successfully upcycled polystyrene, whose uses include protective packaging of CDs and disposable cutlery.
“By applying basically that same reaction that we did for polyethylene toward polystyrene beads, we could turn polystyrene into benzoic acid,” Rabot said. “This allowed basically the same thing to happen, where we convert plastics to a carbon source for fungus.”
Having attained satisfactory results in upcycling two of the most common plastic waste, the team is continuing its research, in coordination with researchers at the University of Kansas, to test the method on “just mixed crap out of the ocean,” as Wang described it.
“We are testing individual materials to see how [they] work in the process and how they can be optimized,” Wang said.
Williams and Wang said they were excited about their discoveries so far, as they would “make a dent in the plastic problem,” Williams said.
“This [method] deals with the plastic that is just trash at the very end of the recycling line,” Williams said. “The other importance is … we’ve got to make something that’s so expensive that you can pay for the cost of the manufacture.” 
The upcycling method could also effectively generate a substantial amount of energy from plastic waste that could be used as fertilizer in agriculture across the country, Williams said. 
“It’s a last line [of defense], it makes it very valuable and it’s potentially a big scale,” Williams said. “I don’t know another technology that does all of those things.”

The sun came out for this past weekend’s East Meets West Invitational in Manhattan Beach, and the Trojans were sizzling. No. 3 USC could not be beaten as the team took down four ranked opponents and extended its win streak to seven since its sole loss to No. 1 TCU on March 17
USC played two duals Friday and two Saturday. Besides USC, the invitational featured No. 2 UCLA, No. 4 Florida State, No. 5 LSU, No. 7 LMU, No. 8 Hawai’i, No. 11 Georgia State and No. 16 FIU.
The tournament commenced as a swell of Tigers fans gathered on the sidelines to watch the Trojans face LSU. Senior Nicole Nourse silenced the crowd on court four with a dual-clinching ace, leading to USC’s 4-1 triumph over the Tigers.
Head Coach Dain Blanton said that the win over LSU established the Trojans’ playing style for the remainder of the tournament.
“Whether you’re switching partners or positions, LSU really just set the tone because that was on Friday morning,” he said. “We knew going into the weekend, this was going to be a big challenge to play four really good teams … All those teams have really great athletes, so we knew we needed some of our best stuff to survive the weekend and go 4-0.”
Tensions ran high later on Friday as the Trojans found themselves down 1-2 in a dual against FSU. At the top spot, juniors Megan Kraft and Delaynie Maple evened the dual score with a 15-21, 25-23, 15-13 win. Moments later, the No. 3 pair — graduate student Madison “Maddog” Shields and freshman Madison White — battled for another three-set victory. USC concluded the dual with a 3-2 score.
White accredited the team’s ability to thrive in high-pressure situations to their trust in one another.
“We’ve had a lot of three-setters this season. Three this weekend alone. What we’ve learned is that we stick with each other. We do that better than a lot of other teams,” White said. “That definitely gives us an edge because, no matter what happens, we know we have each other and we’ll keep fighting until the very end. We have a never give up mindset.”
The Trojans kicked off the second leg of the tournament with a 4-1 defeat of the Georgia State Panthers. Georgia State 5-foot-4-inch junior twins Angel and Bella Ferary ended the 10-0 undefeated record of one-seed tandem Kraft and Maple to earn the Panthers’ only dual point.
The Trojans’ commanding performance culminated with a 5-0 victory over the FIU Panthers. This was an improvement from their 3-2 win over the Panthers earlier this season, and their fifth clean sweep of the year. 
“You want to learn from every experience,” Blanton said. “We learned from that [dual] and made some adjustments, and they made some lineup adjustments. We were still able to take care of them.”
Senior twins Audrey and Nicole Nourse scored the opening dual point at the No. 2 position, placing them at third in USC’s history with 76 match wins as a pair. Kraft and Maple made their resurgence as a duo when they dominated in straight-sets 21-12, 21-10. 
As the Trojans advanced to 20-1 all-time in duals played at Manhattan Beach, the emotion, focus and power of Shields and White attracted the most intrigue from the crowd. The duo showed perfection under pressure with a 4-0 weekend record, three three-set victories and their 12th win together.
“Our energy and intensity completely drive us to succeed and play our best. When we’re at our loudest and most excited, we are dominating. That’s when we have the most fun, so it’s crucial to our playing style as a pair,” Shields said. “When we are dialed in on our side, we’re probably one of the toughest teams to beat and unstoppable … I’m proud of how we finished, and we finished strong.”
The 17-1 Trojans get back to killing it on the court Friday and Saturday at the Pac-12 North Invitational, where they will go head-to-head against Arizona State, Oregon, Arizona and Utah at Stanford’s Beach Volleyball Stadium and Sand Hill Volleyball Courts. USC’s duals with Arizona and Oregon will be streaming live on the Pac-12 Networks.

Following two more losses that continue the trend of 3-1 defeats at the hands of higher ranked teams, it may seem like the No. 11 USC men’s volleyball team is stuck. 
The Trojans did fall to No. 7 BYU twice this past week on Thursday and Friday — with both games ending in that haunting score of 3-1, but all things considered, it may have been one of USC’s best two-game stretches of the season. 
USC came into the week knowing they were facing a tall task. BYU has been excellent at taking advantage of their unique home court, where they are 12-0 this season. 
“It’s a distinct home court advantage,” Head Coach Jeff Nygaard said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “They’ve got well over four or five thousand [fans] a night … there’s some credence to being at higher altitude, it impacts the way that the ball travels a little bit and when you’re not used to it or you just haven’t learned how to play with that, it gives them an advantage because they’re steeped in it.” 
Playing the Cougars on the road has been especially difficult for the Trojans in their history. BYU has beaten the Trojans in Provo, Utah, 27 times in a row. 
The two teams may be more evenly matched this year than in the past. The first matchup was tied 1-1 after the Trojans won the second set 25-22, but BYU pulled away for a 25-17 win in the third set. They used the momentum from the big set win for the fourth set, winning 25-20 to clinch a 3-1 win in the match. 
In the process, senior middle blocker Lucas Frassrand went down with an injury, causing the reliable starter to be unavailable for the rematch one day later. 
Fortunately for the Trojans, redshirt freshman middle blocker Teddy Terrill was ready to step into a starting role and adjusted to the unique conditions of BYU.  
“I think Teddy’s own words were, ‘Coach, I’m a gamer,’” Nygaard said. “We know what he’s done in practice, we know what his strengths are, but what we didn’t know was that he is so adaptable. He’s typically a jump server but as we noted, his jump serve was not going to be consistent at altitude, and he out of the blue just invented a brand new serve where he put it in and gave us opportunities to get points.” 
Terrill was also energized by the hostile atmosphere rather than apprehensive or wracked with nerves.
“Five thousand people, I mean, it’s a blast out there,” Terrill said. “I love playing in the big crowds, I think it’s super awesome to be a part of, so I’m glad Coach [Nygaard] trusted me and gave me the opportunity to go out there.” 
Terrill turned in a solid performance with six kills in the Friday match, the third-highest total on the team. 
The Trojan offense was firing on all cylinders in the Friday match. Freshman outside hitter Dillon Klein had 17 kills with a .400 hitting percentage, redshirt junior opposite hitter Simon Gallas contributed 13 kills and junior middle blocker Kyle Paulson contributed six kills on .667 hitting. 
“We were sustaining a pretty high level of offensive production tonight,” Nygaard said. 
It made for an explosive back-and-forth matchup. After BYU won the first set 25-20 to jump out to a 1-0 lead, the Trojans matched BYU point-for-point in the second set, and they seemed poised to tie the game. But neither team could pull away at the 25-point mark. After more back-and-forth drama, it was the Cougars who eked out a 30-28 victory.
The Trojans did win the next set in incredible, come-from-behind fashion. The Trojans were down 23-20 and then 24-22, both times mere moments away from a sweep. But instead, the Trojans rallied and came from behind for a 26-24 set victory to extend the match. 
Unfortunately, BYU was able to pull away in the fourth set and win 25-14, ending the Trojans’ night in a 3-1 loss once again. 
It was a frustrating result for a team that could have easily been up 2-1 in the match had only a few points gone differently in the first or second set. 
However, this only excites the Trojans if they get to face the Cougars again in the MPSF tournament — which takes place in Stanford, CA, much closer to sea level. 
“Obviously I want those guys again,” Terrill said. “They’re definitely a beatable team … especially without 5,000 fans on their side, I think we’d have a pretty good chance of winning.” 
Nygaard feels the Trojans can rise to the occasion in the MPSF tournament regardless of who they play. 
“Whether it’s BYU or whoever, we feel that we can match up against anyone,” Nygaard said. “We are peaking at the end.” 
For now, however, the Trojans are focused on preparing for crosstown rival and No. 2 ranked UCLA. The Trojans and Bruins will square off twice next weekend: Thursday at Pauley Pavilion and Friday at Galen Center. Both games will be shown on Pac-12 Los Angeles.

On April 9, 2022, the USC baseball team dropped a game to Oregon State at Dedeaux Field, losing 3-2. It was the team’s 11th Pac-12 game of the season, and the loss had the Trojans sitting at a 4-7 conference record. They would go 4-15 the rest of the way to finish 8-22 in conference play and end up dead-last in the Pac-12 standings.
Fast forward to this past weekend, and the Trojans already surpassed that eight win mark, taking two of three games against Utah on the road to bring their conference record to 9-3, with 18 Pac-12 games left on the schedule for Head Coach Andy Stankiewicz’s first season at the helm.
“I am certainly proud of them, we all are. Staff has put in a lot of good work in the fall. They’ve been coachable and they’re working hard so lots to be proud of,” Stankiewicz said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “But at the same time, we’ve got a long way to go and so we just have to stay the course.”
Junior pitcher Tyler Stromsborg was the starting pitcher in that April 9 game against Oregon State, getting credited for the loss. But it was Stromsborg who got the Trojans their eighth Pac-12 win of the season Friday night, pitching a five-hit shutout to lead the Trojans to a 4-0 win and earning Pac-12 Pitcher of the Week in the process. 
“The guys did a great job behind me. I think I just did a good job throwing strikes and trusting the defense,” said Stromsborg in an interview with USC Athletics.
Stromsborg’s complete-game shutout was USC’s first since 2019, when the Trojans beat Washington State 4-0. 
But the strong pitching from the Trojans did not stop there. USC put together a complete performance Saturday night, winning 10-0. Sophomore pitcher Caden Aoki took the mound in the second game of the series, pitching five innings and only giving up four hits before handing it off to a trio of bullpen pitchers to finish off the game.
“Stromsborg and Aoki did a nice job of commanding their fastball, number one. Then both throwing the slider and the breaking ball or a changeup for strikes,” Stankiewicz said. “And so anytime you got three pitches that you can work effectively, it’s going to keep the hitters off balance.”
USC’s bats also came to play in the second tilt of the series, getting six runs in the 4th inning and adding four runs in the final frame to get to a double-digit run total.
The Trojans have won many of their games this season with a strong offense, scoring 7.52 runs per game so far. But the defense and pitching have not always been there, allowing 4.93 runs per game. The back-to-back shutouts of the Utes showed that USC could win on the backs of both a potent offense and solid pitching. 
“You gotta be balanced and that’s part of our goal list to be as balanced of a ballclub as we can be,” Stankiewicz said. “That’s part of what we’ve been trying to train our guys to understand: We don’t want to be a ballclub that has to rely heavily on offense. We don’t want to be a ballclub that has to rely on pitching only.” 
Friday’s game was only the second time USC has won this season when scoring four runs or less. The Trojans are now 2-6 on the season when they score less than five runs.
Despite winning the first two games of the series, the Trojans could not secure their second consecutive Pac-12 series sweep.
USC jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first inning off of back-to-back doubles from senior outfielders Adrian Colon-Rosado and Cole Gabrielson. The Trojans tacked on another run in the 4th inning, but then the bats went cold as USC only mustered two more hits for the rest of the game. The Utes scored the last eight runs of the game to avoid the three-game sweep, and won 8-3.
“It’s hard in any weekend to sweep. It’s Pac-12, man, it’s good teams,” Stankiewicz said. “I thought we missed out on a possible, nice opportunity tonight to get a sweep, but [at the] same time, anytime you go on a weekend, three-game series, you want to win the series. And so we did that and we would have loved to have gotten a win tonight, but to their credit they beat us tonight.”
The Trojans have now won four straight three-game series, all coming against Pac-12 teams. This is the first time the team has won four straight conference series since 2001. All season, USC has played much better in conference play, having a 9-3 Pac-12 record versus a 7-7-1 non-conference record.
“There’s a little bit of extra drive for these guys. You know, we came in last place in the Pac-12 last year. That’s not USC, man, that’s not what USC is supposed to do,” Stankiewicz said. “So I think there’s a little bit of a chip on our shoulder when we get to Pac-12 play.”
USC shifts away from conference play as they take on LMU Tuesday, followed by a Thursday to Saturday series against San Diego State University, all at home. The Trojans will resume Pac-12 play when they travel up to Corvallis to take on the Oregon State Beavers the following weekend.

Over spring break, I got into a nearly two-and-a-half-hour debate with one of my close friends about sports. Not about if LeBron James or Michael Jordan is the GOAT or if Braxton Berrios and Mike White leaving the Jets signifies the end of a dynasty (which it definitely does). My friend was arguing that sports are pointless, and it doesn’t make sense why so many people care about them so much.
Now, as someone striving to work in sports journalism and the literal sports editor at the Daily Trojan, I admittedly got a little defensive about the topic. But looking back now, my friend did have a lot of good and fair points.
From the outside looking in, sports can be repetitive. At its core, sports are just watching a player shoot a ball at a net repeatedly until one team “wins.” The winning side celebrates while the losing side cries. And then it happens again and again, year after year and championship after championship. 
It’s just a constant cycle of winning and losing with no change in between, and yet it’s all people can talk about. These were the main points my friend was making, and even though at the time I was arguing back, I still saw the validity in what they were saying. 
After thinking about it for a while, my friend is right about sports to some extent. But the reason I and so many others find joy and passion in it is because of the intricacies that make each game so unique. I know it’s corny but watching sports is like watching poetry in motion.
The storylines and parodies of each game leave me and sports fans alike craving more and more. Looking at the game from different angles and focusing on what makes each little moment different from the next makes sports exciting every time. 
It’s the instant unifier and is part of why I love sports. I could go up to anyone who loves sports and just say the names Corey Brewer, Jonas Gray or Hatem Ben Arfa, and a smile will instantly follow. Names that mean absolutely nothing to some people represent a story to others.
Even when people aren’t the biggest sports fans, typically, if they find some reason to care about a given game, they tend to get engulfed in the sport like myself. Just last week, I was texting my grandma about the Elite Eight game that was going on between the University of Miami and the University of Texas at Austin.
Before the game, there is no chance my grandma could have named a single player that has played for either school in the last 30 years, let alone currently. But because the schools that were playing were where she met and fell in love with my grandpa (Miami) and then where they moved after and attended grad school together (Texas), she had some skin in the game.
She was rooting for Texas, and when the game finished I got a text saying, “Turning it off. It’s too painful to watch.” She watched intensely because she had a reason to root for a team. The passion, the fire, the sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see how the final seconds of a game will turn out is what draws me back every time.
I’ll always watch, no matter the game. Even if it’s a game between the Spurs and the Trailblazers — which could be an absolute snooze-fest between two bottom clubs in the NBA — I’ll still want to tune in because then I’d get a chance to see Romeo Langford play, who I’ve been following since he’s been in high school.
Myself and other fans develop an affinity for these “random” players and want to see them succeed. It’s like discovering an up-and-coming musician and following their career path, hoping they make it big so everyone will understand why you like them. I’ll go to bat any day for Quincy Enunwa, Nassir Little or Derek Stepan and defend them with my life because I care that much.
I’m going to continue to love sports and follow them at all hours of the day and hopefully even pursue a career in it one day. Maybe sports are stupid and just repetitive, and my life wouldn’t be that different without them. But I don’t really care if that’s true or not because I see the beauty in them and will always continue to.
