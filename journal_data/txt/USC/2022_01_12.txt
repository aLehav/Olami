An hour or two after having lunch on campus Sunday, Hagar Eldeeb, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, went to Seeds Marketplace to get some water. When she tried to check out, her meal swipe declined. Confused as she still had 17 swipes left in the week, Eldeeb asked an employee for assistance. Eldeeb was “shocked” and frustrated to find out that, since she had already used a swipe in the current time-constrained meal period, she’d have to wait to get the water.
The new system, which limited students to three meal swipes per day — one during each designated time block for breakfast, lunch and dinner —differed from the operation of meal swipes during the fall semester, when students with meal plans could use their allotted 19 swipes a week at any time throughout the day.
The change caught students such as Eldeeb by surprise, as USC Hospitality had not officially communicated the change to students until a Jan. 10 email that announced the reversal.
“We’ve recently received inquiries about a restriction that limited meal plan participants to using only one meal swipe per meal period. This change was intended to address technical issues related to mobile ordering, however it also impacted our residential dining venues,” the email from USC Hospitality read. “As of this morning, the one swipe per meal period limit has been removed and all dining plans have been restored to Fall semester settings.”
Luke Morreale, who isn’t currently on campus due to the remote start, said he found out about the softlock through a circulating Instagram post by Muna Obiefule, a freshman majoring in geodesign. Obiefule, who did not respond to the Daily Trojan’s request for comment, encouraged students through her post to contact USC Hospitality and express their concerns. Morreale, who purchased a mandatory meal plan for the year, said he believes the meal swipes restriction was “unfair.” 
“It feels like they’re almost punishing people for using the meal swipes that they paid for,” said Morreale, a freshman majoring in astronautical engineering. “If they’re going to make people buy those meal plans, then they’re obligated to kind of fulfill their end of the agreement where people are entitled to use all 19 swipes a week if they want to.”
Eldeeb was also displeased at the change and said she was “infuriated” that she could no longer choose when to get her food. 
“Because, at that point, it made the meals and made the foods inaccessible to me, personally because I, myself, have to have smaller meals throughout the day,” Eldeeb said. “That’s based on my own digestive system, like that’s what I can handle.”
One of the students who reached out to USC Hospitality on Jan. 9 about the restriction was Raegan Kirby, a junior majoring in religious studies, who said the restriction “put every student in the same box” by disregarding individual eating habits, especially of those with eating disorders or at risk of developing an eating disorder.
“Because it doesn’t look like [this] every day, three meals at this certain time for everyone,” Kirby said. “If someone has to eat more later on in order to keep with a healthy weight and consumption, then that’s what they have to do, and for the University to put a limit on that is really, really harmful to the community.”
Glad that USC Hospitality overturned the change, Eldeeb said the University’s lack of transparency about the intention behind the softlock caused her to wonder whether it was an effort to prevent students from donating their meal swipes.
“They realized that the students were using their … meal swipes, to help others other than themselves, and for good reasons at that,” Eldeeb said. “It kind of sent out that message to a lot of people that they don’t want that kind of generosity to spread, and they want to limit us, even though we’re the ones paying it anyway.”
Kirby said she similarly feels a “sense of success,” in that the complaints she and other students sent to USC Hospitality resulted in the reversal of the softlock, and is “very thankful” for Obiefule’s post. Kirby said she is concerned, however, about what the change, however short-lived, said about the University’s priorities.
“At the end of the day, USC cares a lot more about performance and how they look to the outside, rather than the actual health of each individual student, unfortunately,” Kirby said. “So this change, I think, it’s kind of helping that.”

The emergence and subsequently record-breaking spread of the Omicron variant has brought a range of updated policies at USC, ranging from a delayed start of in-person classes to new booster shot requirements. To help you keep up with and understand the newest coronavirus protocols, we’ve compiled the most current University-announced policies and guidelines.
Return to in-person instruction
In a communitywide email sent Jan. 7, Provost Charles Zukowsi announced that classes will continue to be held remotely for an additional four days, delaying the start of in-person instruction from Jan. 18 to Jan. 24. The change, the email read, is meant to provide more time for students, staff and faculty to receive booster shots, arrange testing and recover from possible illnesses. Students enrolled in graduate and professional programs should expect guidance from their individual schools for program-specific exceptions or plans.
In a student media briefing with the Daily Trojan on Jan. 3, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said decisions to extend remote instruction would be driven by “local county conditions” and “staff and faculty cases.” 
President Carol Folt wrote that while the semester is off to a remote start, the University will transition to in-person instruction “later this month,” according to her Jan. 11 communitywide email titled “Spring Start Welcome.”
Booster shots
Booster shots are required for all students, faculty and staff as soon as they become eligible. Community members who are eligible should arrange to receive boosters before returning to campus. 
The period of eligibility for those who received the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines for their first series has been shortened, and they may receive their booster shots five months after their second shot. Individuals vaccinated with the single dose Johnson & Johnson may get their booster shot two months after their first jab. Proof must be uploaded to MySHR by Jan. 31 to avoid facing restrictions regarding campus access.
Student Health highly recommends mRNA vaccines as boosters, especially Pfizer, regardless of the first series vaccine received. Unvaccinated community members with previously obtained medical or religious exemptions may be exempt from the booster requirement and must submit a coronavirus test through the University’s population testing program every 72 hours. 
As of Jan. 3, 25% of faculty, staff and graduate students have gotten their boosters, and about 23% of undergraduates have gotten theirs, according to Dr. Van Orman. 
Housing
Residence halls and campus housing reopened, as scheduled, on Jan. 6. Students moving in as new residents need to show proof of a negative coronavirus test. A positive test collected 10 to 90 days prior to move-in satisfies the testing requirement, as well. 
The Jan. 7 email from the Office of the Provost notes that while housing is open and available for those who need it, students are encouraged to delay their return to campus during the period of remote instruction. Any students who test positive less than 10 days prior to moving in should delay their return to USC Housing and report their positive result to Student Health.
The no-guest policy has been reinstated for the beginning of the spring semester, as announced in a Dec. 29 email from USC Housing. Masking is required in all common spaces of housing facilities.
Masking
In a memo released on Jan. 5 titled “Updated Masking Guidance for Campus Environments,” the University announced that starting Jan. 18, all faculty, staff, students and campus visitors will be required to wear medical grade masks in all campus spaces where masks must be worn, such as indoor common spaces and classrooms. Student Health also recommends masking in crowded outdoor areas and other settings with close interpersonal contact. 
In accordance with a change in guidance by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health and the L.A. County Department of Public Health, cloth masks worn without a surgical mask and other non-medical grade face coverings, including bandanas and neck gaiters, are no longer considered to provide adequate protection from the coronavirus. Medical grade masks include surgical masks and higher grade respirator masks (N95, KN95 or KF94). 
Further guidance in the memo states that masks with a one-way valve are no longer acceptable either, and that wearing two medical grade masks at once is not recommended. Masks most effective at preventing the spread have a nose wire, do not gap and cover the mouth, nose and chin. 
Students and visitors who do not have an approved mask may obtain one, free of charge, from any one of the Trojan Check campus entry points. Employees should contact their respective departments directly for information about obtaining surgical masks for use at work. 
Testing
As was the case in the fall, weekly surveillance testing is required for all vaccinated students, while unvaccinated students with an approved exemption must test once every 72 hours. Dr. Van Orman said during the Jan. 3 media briefing that the University has the capacity to provide about 50,000 PCR tests each week this semester, compared to last semester’s average of about 35,000. 
Students travelling to get to campus this spring are required to test before leaving their winter break location and are recommended to test 48 hours before leaving. Individuals who have had a recent coronavirus infection and are unable to test will need to obtain a “90 day exemption” letter from their healthcare provider. 
Student Health recommends PCR tests for the most accurate detection of an infection as they amplify virus particles for greater sensitivity. At-home rapid antigen tests are effective at detecting infection in individuals with higher viral load, 48 hours or longer after exposure but less effective at detecting infection if viral load is low. 
Isolation and quarantine 
USC Student Health is obligated to follow guidance from the LACDPH, including rules about isolation and quarantine. LACDPH requires a five-day isolation period for those with detected coronavirus illness, which can be ended on day six if the individual no longer exhibits symptoms and tests negative on a viral test collected on or after day five. 
Whether or not quarantine is required for those who have been exposed to the coronavirus depends on whether they are up to date with their coronavirus vaccines and whether they exhibit symptoms. If the exposed has received all vaccine doses that they are eligible for and are not feeling sick, they do not need to quarantine but should test immediately. If they are missing a dose, are unvaccinated or are showing symptoms, a quarantine of five days with a negative test on day five or later is required. 
According to the latest statistics posted to USC’s COVID-19 Dashboard, there are currently 253 available spaces for eligible isolation and quarantine individuals. During the Jan. 3 media briefing, Dr. Van Orman said that the University has “adequate isolation capacity” and, if necessary, will provide spaces in the USC Hotel, another hotel in Downtown L.A. and one other facility that she said she couldn’t share details about. 
Correction: A previous version of this article wrongly abbreviated the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health as LADPH, rather than LACDPH. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

USC announced an extension of its remote instruction period by an additional week in a Jan. 7 communitywide email, following its initial Dec. 24 announcement of a weeklong period, hindering plans for return and adding uncertainty to the semester ahead. 
In a series of interviews with the Daily Trojan, students expressed tentative approval, disappointment and indifference about the virtual two weeks. 
Ryan Benson, a junior majoring in acting, is worried about the outlook for the semester ahead, after experiencing difficulty in last year’s online classes.
“It’s slightly expected,” Benson said. “But, in general, with the classes of last year online, I just get angry because it just reminds me of how it was, how it really affected my mental health. I’m just not looking forward to it that much.”
Benson said his fears are primarily driven by the difficulty of conducting acting classes online. 
“I had freshman year all in person, and that was great,” Benson said. “But then, right when we went online, it was just so confusing. You’re not interacting with anyone and you don’t really get a good energy; you’re in your bedroom so you don’t have a nice space to really work.” 
Benson does not expect a fully online semester. He is “guessing all [of] January is going to be online,” but said that “it’s hard to tell” at this point. 
Like Benson, Eszter Morvay, a sophomore majoring in computer science, said she is “OK with” online classes for a short period but raised concerns about a longer delay of the return to in-person learning. She said it was easier to interact with those around her in the fall semester’s in-person classes compared to last year’s online classes. 
“This year, I definitely had a lot more chances to collaborate with other people,” Morvay said. “Last year, I didn’t really get to meet that many people. Also, I feel like I didn’t really have much of a connection with my professors.”
Morvay also said she “doesn’t trust [USC] to communicate effectively” in regards to future plans for remote learning.. Last year, when Morvay was an incoming freshman, the University originally announced plans for a hybrid fall semester before moving it entirely online. She said she now fears the University will do something similar with the upcoming semester.
Some students do not mind the move. Noah Kim, a senior majoring in computer science, said he has little preference between in-person and online learning. 
“I’m planning on going back either way,” Kim said. “I don’t really mind, but it’s nice to not have to go into class. I think the quality of teaching hasn’t decreased too much for me. I’m a person who learns a lot outside of lecture, and so having the lectures on demand, if I need to review for anything, or just be able to learn asynchronously, has actually almost helped me in a certain sense.”
Kim is also a teaching assistant for a computer science class and said the class “greatly benefited from the fact that a lot of [its] material is already focused on being online” and that while he’s “not super worried” about online learning, he could “see it being a huge concern for basically anyone else.”
Among the students concerned was Reed Wilson, a freshman majoring in architecture, who said he worries about how his architecture classes might fare online.
“Architecture is more of a hands-on type of program, where we’re constantly in studio, doing model-building and all that stuff,” Wilson said. “It’s definitely not impossible, but it’s definitely gonna be a lot more difficult and maybe harder for a lot of the kids to adjust to.”
Wilson wishes the University would have moved forward with beginning in person, citing the success of last semester’s coronavirus policies. 
“I was a bit shocked because USC last semester was doing phenomenal and we had a record low number of cases,” Wilson said. “I feel like it would have been fine.” 
However, some students, like Yazeed Alrajhi, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering, approved of the University’s decision.
“I’m supportive of it,” Alrajhi said. “I think it’s a smart thing to find the positive cases and isolate those for the first week as students come back.”  
Alrajhi also said he is “fully in support” of the requirement that all students receive a vaccine booster dose, which the University announced along with its initial remote instruction period. 
Students began the fifth pandemic-era semester Monday. The uncertainty surrounding the semester brings dampened optimism to students, many of whom look forward to starting classes but hope they are not on Zoom for the long haul.
“To have a schedule and just to do stuff again is nice,” Benson said. “I would definitely want [the remote period] to be [only] two weeks and then get back into it.”

As the seconds ticked away into the New Year, people hoped 2022 would be different than the last two years. 
Six days in and it was just like any other — No. 5 men’s basketball looked like a threat as they beat UC Berkeley on the road in its first game in 19 days due to a coronavirus pause. 
The first game of 2022 played out like others in the latter half of 2021:
Junior forward Isaiah Mobley splashing 3-pointers, senior guard Drew Peterson hitting one-legged midrange fadeaways, redshirt senior forward Chevez Goodwin bruising opposing centers with hook shots and Head Coach Andy Enfield leaving happy.
USC looked vulnerable in its loss on the road against Stanford. But, the Trojans missed double digit free throws, practically shooting themselves in the foot. There’s no need to panic since it’s mid-January and USC was not going to go undefeated. However, there’s still lots of promise. 
This is the year the Trojans will win the Pac-12 and make some noise in a conference that often overlooks them. 
USC is good — really good. Good enough to win the Pac-12 for the first time since 1984-1985, good enough to make another deep run in March Madness and good enough to create some buzz at this Lincoln Riley-infused football school. 
What makes the Trojans scary this season is the winning combination in college basketball — depth and experience. It sounds pretty simple, but in the one-and-done nature of college basketball, now, it’s a rarity. 
Last year’s National Champion Baylor, for example, was led by a trio of upperclassmen in Davion Mitchell, MaCio Teague and Jared Butler. Three of the top four scorers for 2019 National Champions Virginia were upperclassmen too.
USC had six returning rotation players from last year’s Elite Eight team: Mobley, Peterson, Goodwin, junior guard Ethan Anderson, junior forward Max Agbonkpolo and redshirt senior guard Isaiah White. 
Their chemistry is evident on the court, especially on the defensive side which is an amalgamation of talent and understanding defensive schemes. The length of these players sets up a defense that looks like an octopus with hands in every single passing lane. 
The six returnees have played in Enfield’s system for at least two seasons, they know what it takes and it shows. As of Sunday, the Trojans hold opponents to the third-fewest field goal percentage per game — 35.5%. The next closest Pac-12 team is Washington State at 47.  
That depth is evident on offense too. Four players are averaging double digit points, with any starter having the potential to dominate a game. 
The main difference between this side and last year’s Elite Eight run is, obviously, no Evan Mobley. The Pac-12 Player of the Year isn’t an easy player to replace, but the development of last year’s supporting cast has made it easy. 
The improvement of Peterson and Goodwin has been enormous for this team. 
Peterson’s become a midrange maestro and a capable playmaker who can rebound the ball strong, then push it down the floor. He’s averaging 11.1 points per game on nearly 50% shooting from the field, an increase from 9.8 on 42.4% shooting last year. He also carries a sense of swag and confidence with him on the court, almost like he knows he’s going to score, and you can’t really do much about it.
Goodwin has seen the biggest jump since last year. He’s more than doubled his point average from 5.6 to 13.1 on a ridiculous 64.3% shooting per game. He’s finishing strong in the paint again, but his offensive game has expanded with less reliance on putback layups and more versatility with dribble drives toward the basket. 
Even Mobley has improved too, becoming an outstanding all-around player who does everything for this team. He’s currently shooting 44% from three which is absurd for someone nearly 7-feet tall.
You add electric transfer guard Boogie Ellis to these returning players, and it’s no surprise that USC is undefeated. Ellis gets a lot of attention from defenses because of his three-level scoring ability and microwave offensive prowess. It’s a blessing in disguise since the Trojans’ depth makes focusing a defense on Ellis a disadvantage for the opponent.
But, no team is perfect, and USC is far from it. A free-throw percentage of 60% as a team is pretty comical, and it cost them against the Cardinal Tuesday. Scoring droughts are also becoming a commonality. You can’t win games if you go more than five minutes without a basket.  
The Trojans can make it happen this year. The depth is on display, the chemistry is off the charts and the coaching of Enfield is among the ten best in the country. 
No statement win has come yet, even though strong road wins against Washington State and California in the midst of a long home win streak are pretty close. Some might say there needs to be more done, but I’ve seen enough.
USC is winning the Pac-12.

As students and faculty alike prepare to return for the spring semester, fall sports conclude and spring competitions begin. Increased coronavirus restrictions have postponed certain events, namely men’s and women’s basketball, but there are still plenty of USC sports yet to begin. Here are some teams to look out for in their upcoming seasons.
Men’s and Women’s Basketball
Despite a slough of postponements and cancelations, both USC basketball teams had strong early-season showings and are now looking to solidify themselves in Pac-12 play.
Men’s basketball sits at No. 5 in the national rankings after a 13-1 start to its season. The team’s undefeated run came to a close Jan. 11 with a 75-69 loss to Stanford on the road, pushing the Trojans to a 3-1 conference record. USC’s strong defense is a characteristic of Head Coach Andy Enfield’s program, and the team ranks 19th in the nation in Kenpom’s defensive efficiency metric this season. As one of the major contenders in the Pac-12, the pressure will continue to build with each game as more eyes turn to the Trojans. 
Women’s basketball rattled off three straight wins to begin its season under new Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb and now sits at 8-4 on the season. Despite a slow start to conference play, the team is trending in the right direction — a blowout loss to Colorado was followed up by a 76-67 upset win over No. 4 Arizona, ending the Wildcats’ unbeaten season. USC will host Washington State Jan. 14 at the Galen Center with an opportunity to further their case in the Pac-12. 
Men’s Volleyball
The season is young for men’s volleyball, but the team appears to be in midseason form. The Trojans ranked just outside the top 15 in the preseason poll but are already taking down ranked opponents. In its first two games of the new year, USC beat No. 11 UC Santa Barbara on back-to-back days Jan. 6 and 7 in five and four sets, respectively. Two early road victories set the Trojans up for two home games against Princeton Jan. 12 and Erskine Jan. 14. 
Graduate student outside hitter Sam Kobrine transferred to USC from UCLA in 2021, adding an accomplished resume to the Trojans’ roster. Starting in every match for the Bruins, Kobrine earned All-Mountain Pacific Sports Federation first team honors last season. Picking up from where he left off, Kobrine leads the team with 33 kills over the first two games. Kobrine’s veteran play will be crucial for the Trojans as they look to best last season’s 5-13 record.
Women’s Beach Volleyball 
After securing a National Championship win in 2021, the women’s beach volleyball team returns with high expectations once again. A 30-4 record was capped off by a signature win over No. 1 ranked UCLA in the National Championship game last season.
Head Coach Dain Blanton has accelerated the program’s winning over his three-year tenure in charge. His 2020 squad finished just 6-5, with the coronavirus pandemic shutting down the season early. Last year’s resurgence continued the winning tradition of previous Head Coach Anna Collier, the first ever head coach of the program and a two-time National Coach of the Year.
The pair of now-senior Tina Graudina and sophomore Megan Kraft shined last season and both are returning to the squad in 2022. The duo was named Pac-12 Pair of the Year, and individually, Graudina was named Player of the Year and Kraft the Freshman of the Year. The two aren’t the only pair returning though, as the No. 2 pair in last season’s championship matchup against UCLA, now-graduate students Julia Scoles and Sammy Slater, is returning to the team as well. 
USC retained its core of players from last season’s success and will defend its title in 2022. The Trojans will begin their season Feb. 24 against Long Beach State.
Baseball
The Trojans ended the 2021 season with a win percentage just under .500 and sat in ninth place in the Pac-12. With room for improvement heading into 2022, the team will lean on last season’s top performers once again. 
Sophomore catcher Garret Guillemette looks to lead the roster after a breakout freshman season. Guillemette had the second-best batting average on the team as a freshman last season at .299 and also pulled his weight defensively with a .994 fielding percentage. On the mound, redshirt senior starting pitcher Isaac Esqueda returns, having pitched the most innings for the Trojans last season. He posted a 3.47 ERA and a 6-3 record in 14 starts in 2021 and likely will serve as the team’s ace.  
Along with the veterans, Head Coach Jason Gill put together the No. 17 ranked recruiting 2021 class in the nation. Eric Hammond headlines the group of freshmen. A right-hander from Texas, Hammond turned down professional opportunities to play for USC after being drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 19th round of the 2021 MLB draft. 
The program’s history of success includes 12 national championships, and this year’s team is aiming to return to its former glory. USC will host its first game of the season Feb. 18 against Santa Clara.

On paper, pop superstar Miley Cyrus and Congressional Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez don’t have much in common, to say the least. Yet, both public figures have openly addressed an ethical dilemma plaguing much of the world’s younger generations — whether or not to have children. 
It’s no secret that if the human population doesn’t make some major changes to their lifestyles very soon, the lives of future generations will be increasingly difficult. From powerful storms to rising global temperatures, humanity’s unchecked impact on the planet has already demonstrated disastrous outcomes. The concern is a legitimate one — why give birth to a child whose life may be doomed from the start?
Recent years have seen dropping birth rates in many of the world’s most populous nations, including the United States, China and India. Analysts at global investment bank Morgan Stanley noted that the “movement to not have children owing to fears over climate change is growing and impacting fertility rates quicker than any preceding trend in the field of fertility decline.”
The creation of activist organizations such as Conceivable Future and BirthStrike have taken the conversation further. The underlying belief of these groups is that more children will negatively impact the planet — causing more consumption, emissions and an entire genealogical line of detrimental climate consequences. 
One 2017 Swedish study calculated that one fewer child per family could save approximately 58.6 metric tons of carbon emissions each year in developed nations. However, scientists argue that reducing the population is not a solution to the climate crisis given the environmental pressures we’ll face within this decade. 
Additionally, implementing strict population control is no quick fix. A 2014 study modeled various population control mechanisms and found that a one-child policy imposed worldwide would still result in a global population between five to ten billion people by the turn of the century. 
While theoretical models cannot account for all challenges, procreation is not as destructive to the environment as initially claimed. 
Much of the world’s population growth is projected to occur in developing nations while the majority of carbon dioxide emissions come from more industrialized countries with lower birth rates. We cannot ignore the resource consumption imbalance between countries. The movement is about much more than just sheer number of people; it’s about the way we live our lives and the amount of natural capital we deplete.
The majority of the activists that belong to groups such as BirthStrike and Conceivable Future don’t endorse forcible population control and encourage adoption, having joined the groups to promote dialogue. Simply put, the questions that they’re asking are more important than the answers. 
Detrimental impact of negligible population growth aside, birth strike groups are also compelled to consider the opposite — the potential ways in which the world that we leave may harm our hypothetical offspring. Is it justifiable to bring children into a world where steady access to things such as fresh water, nutritious food and viable shelter do not exist?
On Jan. 5, Pope Francis addressed dropping birth rates at his Vatican address, callously asserting that choosing to not have children is a form of “selfishness.” While the birth strike movement may clash with religious doctrines and basic population economics, the choice to have children is a deeply personal decision that should not be borne out of a sense of obligation.
The earth inevitably has an absolute limit. However, the focus on reducing childbirth is a facade for a more complex problem, one which activist groups hope to normalize and bring to a wider stage. We need to ask ourselves — why is it so carbon-intensive to have a child in the first place?
Population control is a red herring, a comparatively inconsequential debate that detracts from the deeper and more complicated infrastructural changes that we so desperately need to implement to cope with a changing climate. 
Instead of circumventing the uncomfortable truth with inconsequential individual lifestyle choices, we need to face our overuse of fossil fuels and overproduction of goods. The greatest progress will be made by focusing on policies and technologies that will change consumption habits, minimize carbon footprints and target the rising tide of natural resource scarcity, not through limiting procreation. 
Choosing to have children may signify commitment to a better future, but the undertaking doesn’t stop there — it’s our responsibility as a society to leave this world in better shape than we found it for future generations.

The airtight, close quarters and cramped nature of airplanes have intensified the risk of flying the unfriendly skies during the pandemic. With the surge of the Omicron variant, waiting in packed security lines, boarding planes and walking within crowded airports have also taken on a compounded risk factor. 
While commercial jets are equipped with “HEPA filters capable of removing tiny airborne particles” and passengers are required to wear masks on their domestic flights, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn’t implemented any other safety precautions on airlines to help preempt the spread of the coronavirus. This must change. Given Omicron’s incredibly high transmission rate, it is paramount that the government institutes a universal vaccination mandate prior to flying domestically. 
On Nov. 8, 2021, Los Angeles launched SafePassLA, stipulating that indoor establishments such as restaurants, salons, movie theaters and gyms require proof of full vaccination for patrons to enter. It’s therefore reasonable that airports should follow suit.
As of Dec. 6, 2021, the White House requires all international travelers to show proof of vaccination and a negative coronavirus test taken no more than one day before travel to the United States. Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci further asserted that vaccine requirements for commercial flights are “something that seriously should be considered.” 
However, in an interview with ABC News, President Joe Biden stated he has yet to institute such a requirement because he’s been advised that it’s “not necessary.” When you employ cost-benefit analysis to this situation, it’s clear that such a vaccination requirement presents more benefits than it does drawbacks. 
Dissenters typically highlight three drawbacks regarding mandatory vaccinations on air travel. First, it would adversely affect airlines economically; it would also make the boarding process too time-consuming, and it would be burdensome to implement. First and foremost, all of these objections pale in comparison to the overarching benefit of protecting public health. While some may believe that a vaccination mandate would dissuade people from traveling and thereby create an economic deficit for the airlines, this simply doesn’t add up as people still regularly visit their gyms or hair salons despite the vaccine mandate. 
This also begs the question of how domestic students will be affected when they fly in for school after the holidays. According to Dr. Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the U.K. Health Security Agency, the “omicron variant can infect 3 to 5 people at a time.” The unfortunate reality then is that students have an increased risk of getting the coronavirus and then risk subsequently transmitting the virus to fellow students. 
As for the arguments centered around time and burdensomeness, the post-9/11 airport security and safety precautions undermine such beliefs. Before 9/11, there was virtually no security within airports. Seemingly overnight, however, the aftermath of  9/11 saw the development of a thorough screening process that includes security lines, 3D imaging scanners, X-ray machines for carry-ons and more. While requirements of vaccinations may prolong security and prove cumbersome to implement, it certainly isn’t unfeasible. 
The irony of this debate is striking. Take an international student who has to take a connecting flight domestically to get back on campus. The student is required to show proof of vaccination prior to flying internationally but is not required to do so on his domestic flight to California. So while it’s difficult to get into the country, it’s not a big deal for someone to fly into L. A. Yet, for the said individual to even step foot onto campus, they are required to show proof of full vaccination, test negative for the coronavirus before arriving, schedule a screening test within three to five days of arrival to campus and are expected to refrain from interacting with large groups.
Given the clear disconnect, it’s unsurprising that the U.S. leads in the highest number of coronavirus cases and coronavirus-related deaths with over 60,600,000 cases and 858,000 deaths and counting. While the coronavirus is rampant globally, there’s a stark contrast between the pandemic numbers in the U.S. as opposed to overseas. For example, India last recorded 35,516,186 coronavirus cases and 483,463 deaths on Saturday. 
Ostensibly, people aren’t permitted to enter the U.S. without proof of vaccination as a means of protecting the country. Meanwhile, people who are unvaccinated and potentially positive for the coronavirus are flying within the country. This logic simply doesn’t exist.

Speaking from personal experience, the old motivation wheels can feel a bit rusty when coming back to school (and reality) after such an extensive break. And honestly, the start of this year feels a little bit like 2020, part two. 
Even though the state of our school and country is constantly changing due to the coronavirus pandemic, we can still fall back on some wonderful music to get us through the start of this year and semester. Here is a collection of tunes fit to kick off 2022 and the Spring. 
“22 (Taylor’s Version)” by Taylor Swift (2021)
A decade later, the 2012 hit is somehow still a fitting song for 2022. The re-released version of this iconic Taylor Swift ballad perfectly emulates how many of us feel at the beginning of a new year: “happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time.” Although Swift crafted the original version of this song and the album it’s featured on 10 years ago, her re-recorded version of Red maintained its popularity to become one of the most successful albums of 2021.
“Easy On Me” by Adele (2021)
Let’s hope the coronavirus and the transition back into school is easy on us. This song was a hit from Adele’s fourth studio album, 30, which highlighted her newfound freedom after a recent divorce. Although the tracks on 30 display the full spectrum of Adele’s emotions, this song in particular reminds us that it’s OK to be vulnerable, especially during a global pandemic. Besides, after everything we have been through, we deserve for 2022 to go a little easy on us.
“Life Goes On” by Oliver Tree (2021)
Though our world seems uncertain and moments come when we may feel it collapsing around us, this track reminds us that life “goes on and on and on.” After its release in late May 2020, the track was popularized on TikTok as an upbeat, hopeful breakup anthem suitable for our unsure moment in history. It’s the ideal soundtrack to your moments of perseverance this past year. 
“Here Comes The Sun” by The Beatles (1969)
Did you spend your winter break in the frigid Midwest, or one of the treacherous snowstorms that plagued the East Coast? If so, this song is definitely for you. Even if you were snuggled up somewhere warm this winter break, there is nothing quite like the Southern California sun or The Beatles to brighten up your January that much more. 
“More Than Friends” by 24kGoldn (2021)
USC alumnus 24kGoldn adds a modern twist to the 1990s classic “Just A Friend” by the late Biz Markie, who passed away last July at age 57. Released 32 years after the original, this track enhances the themes of Markie’s hit while amplifying 24kGoldn’s modern rap style. Even though this song ultimately captures a tongue-in-cheek tale of unrequited love, it’s also great for a New Year’s resolution workout playlist or to blast with the windows down en route to the beach. 
“R.E.M.” by Ariana Grande (2018)
In this track off her fourth studio album Sweetener, Ariana Grande encapsulates the feelings that arise when we return to our friends after time away. Especially after our remote start, coming back to friends, activities and campus will feel like “such a dream,” as Grande sings. As winter slowly transitions into spring, you might be just as hopeful as Ari for budding relationships or friendships. 
“That Funny Feeling” by Phoebe Bridgers (2021)
Who knew that a song written by Vine star and absurd comedian Bo Burnham could be so emotionally poignant, especially enhanced by the voice of indie star Phoebe Bridgers. The track’s haunting lyrics pair perfectly with her velvety tone, as she describes “that funny feeling” of navigating our emotions and mental health which seems to have become common in the pandemic. Burnham’s Inside was an exceptional portrait of life in quarantine, and this cover of a standout track from the film is all the more powerful.  
“Darling” by Halsey (2021)
Although Halsey has previously been known for making music in a pop style, this acoustic gem is a perfect introduction to her songwriting ability. Winter can be a difficult time for many, but Halsey’s heartfelt lyrics describe the importance of a person who has shown her “how to love bein’ alive.” As the new year begins, we can also focus on the activities and people that fill us with joy and hope. 
“Gasoline” by The Weeknd (2022) 
The Weeknd is giving us a fresh sound in his fifth studio album, Dawn FM. This track features the same driving synth beats and retro sounds which made After Hours such a trailblazing pop album in 2020, indicating that those throwback elements aren’t going away any time soon. It’s great for a shot of energy at any time, whether queued up for a dance party or just to play between classes. Though the cover art is likely his strangest yet, The Weeknd’s latest album is certainly worth a listen as you hype yourself up for the start of a new semester.

Content warning: This article contains references to substance abuse and addiction.
This review contains spoilers.
It’s been more than two years since “Euphoria” first hit our screens and shocked viewers with its horrifying depictions of love, sex and high school. “Euphoria” drew viewers into its hyperbolic portrayal of the dreadful teenage years and a brutal, but honest, depiction of addiction. 
The show is shocking, yet enthralling, and season two promises to smash the sky-high bar set by season one. “Euphoria” season two premiered Sunday night, and the first episode suggests over-the-top, glamorous episodes to come filled with petty, but genuine, drama. 
The episode primarily follows Rue (Zendaya), an addict struggling to achieve sobriety, and Fez (Angus Cloud), a drug dealer with a traumatic upbringing. Viewers are guaranteed to be immediately hooked by the engaging storyline and incredible acting. 
Just as in season one, season two of “Euphoria” hits all the right notes — literally. It utilizes an alluring soundtrack composed by British artist Labrinth that has the viewer feel anger, pain and heartache, all within about two minutes. Labrinth’s music is an addictive and significant component that makes “Euphoria” such an incredible show. 
In addition to a phenomenal soundtrack, cinematographer Marcell Rév took a leap of faith this season and decided to record using film instead of digital. The result is incredible: using film completely changes the coloring of the show and significantly affects the mood. Rév’s use of film adds an unexplainable layer of sadness to the episode and significantly increases the emotional impact of something as simple as a tear on Jules’ (Hunter Schafer) face or Rue in front of a fire. 
Now, that is not to discount the show’s fascinating plot and bewitching acting. This latest episode, “Trying to Get to Heaven Before They Close the Door,” begins with a drawn-out exposition of Fez, the resident drug dealer. It explains Fez’ backstory, certifying that his complexity of character extends beyond his occupation. 
It’s heart-wrenching to watch Fez’s trauma unfold on screen, but the most despairing factor is the emotionless child we watch Fez become. First, we learn about his abusive father and then his drug-dealing grandmother. Though an admittedly badass woman, she treats Fez not as her grandson but as a business partner. 
Young Fez (Mason Shea Joyce) does an incredible job portraying his character … by doing next to nothing. With any lines, he mostly just stands on screen and watches his grandmother work. Still, Joyce manages to display an unbelievable amount of sadness, confusion, determination and joy on his face. 
Based on episode one, the showrunners establish Fez as a more significant part of season two, and it is a wonderfully smart choice. Fez received more character development and influence on the plot than he did in all of season one. 
It’s impossible to talk about “Euphoria” without talking about Rue. Viewers meet Rue again after her relapse and as she comes to terms from her fallout with Jules. Zendaya’s depiction of Rue is spectacular; she experiences intense moments of ecstasy and life-threatening, jaw-dropping moments of terror — all while taking the audience along. 
The Rue-Jules relationship is a hauntingly beautiful look at the pain of addiction and the struggle of loving an addict. Rue loves Jules but cannot break her addiction which is triggered by anything detrimental happening between herself and Jules. Jules is burdened with the knowledge that she might trigger Rue into a relapse, an action which would not be her fault. Jules’ emotional turmoil and struggle surrounding her feelings for Rue is a heartbreaking reminder that addiction does not solely impact the addict but also their loved ones. 
Jules is afflicted with the pain that comes from loving an addict, but even as she mainly serves as a supporting character for Rue, Jules still manages to steal the show. Schafer’s ability to lure the viewer in with something as small as a face twitch means that every time Jules is on screen, you are watching her. Her pain and heartache surrounding Rue are obvious to viewers within a second, even when she smiles. Jules is one of the most complex characters on “Euphoria,” yet, through Schafer’s unmatched storytelling abilities, she is possibly the most understandable. 
This season, “Euphoria” promises an even darker storyline, a choice which transforms the characters we’ve come to know into real humans. By developing complex backstories for side characters and allowing viewers to see the unwavering interpersonal damage addiction creates, “Euphoria” turns down the flashy gimmicks from season one to offer viewers a horrifying look at the realities of modern life.

2021 is over. 
Finally.
I get excited about the new year because so much can happen — both good and bad — and, while it’s hard to predict what it will be, I’m here to offer my services with my 2022 fashion trend predictions. So sit back and buckle up because I’m here to give you all the details you could ever dream of:
First: accessories galore. 
Before I get into heavy detail, know that when I say accessories, I mean beyond jewelry and into outerwear essentials. For my fellow East Coast-ers (or people that run cold), if you haven’t jumped on the large scarf trend yet, you still have time. Acne Studios exploded this winter with their multicolored giant checkered scarf, and the world has been eating it up. BP. also has a great dupe (with pockets!). You can pick them up at Nordstrom, or, if you want a statement, check out H&M’s neon green chain link scarf. 
Not a scarf person? That’s fine too: balaclavas and opera gloves are also here to snatch up your holiday money. Balaclavas are a great way to keep your head warm and come in varying prints, sizes and fits. On the other hand, opera gloves have also slowly creeped back into our lives after starting their prowl in 2020. Check out Heaven by Marc Jacobs, T Label and Savage x Fenty. 
And, finally, medium to large bags will start to come back. Considering the world just moved past the micro bag trend, emphasized by Jacquemus and his Chiquito bags, and began to re-embrace medium-size bags in 2021, like Prada’s Cleo and Gucci’s iconic Jackie, I believe the end of 2022 and early 2023 will see the return of larger bags. I’m predicting the return of Fendi’s spy bags, even more craze on Hermès’s Birkins and possibly Louis Vuitton’s monogrammed ‘neverfull.’ Better raid mom’s closet now for those scrumptious (and, let’s be honest, more practical) bags!
What about your actual clothes? 
Don’t fret, because your hemlines are prepping for a major makeover. Sleeper’s feather-trimmed hems and Area NYC’s crystal details have done this for a while, but now their credit is starting to roll in. Whether this means adding beading to the ends of your dresses like 90’s Betsy Johnson or playing with necklines like Danielle Guizio did for her most recent collection, prepare to have your clothes announce you before you enter any room. 
On the topic of grand and flashy, big collars are here to stay. Many blouses and button-up shirts are now sold with Harlequin-esque collars. Whether long and pointed or rounded with lace detail, I strongly believe they are here to run their course. If you don’t want to buy a completely new button -up, Ganni and Lisa Says Gah’s large collar accessories are a great way to participate in this trend. 
Ballet-core seems to be getting ready to come to center stage for a little, so hit your local Capezios! There was an enormous surge in leg warmers and fingerless gloves — NOT the “Emily in Paris” kind, don’t even get me started on those — at the end of 2021. I see a lot of emphasis on the minimalistic, effortless type of ballerina, gravitating toward brands like Orseund Iris, Are You Am I and even Skims with its buttery bodysuits. 
Of course, we can’t ignore the environment. 
Fast fashion is still a huge issue, and the effects of global warming are right in front of us. I want to continue to push the mission of thrifting and buying secondhand, but 2022 introduces us to a new way of buying secondhand: upcycling. 
It can mean purchasing old garments and using the fabric to make something new. On a consumer level, many stores have taken extra fabric to create super cool “new” clothes such as Konkrite Market and his reworked Nike hoodies. Another interpretation of upcycling that I believe will take off are clothing rental services; in fact, Burberry recently announced they would participate in “circular fashion” by renting out through their partnership with My Wardrobe HQ.
We can’t discuss trends without colors. 
This year, I’ll have to name the color scheme “Cafe Paris Jewel Tones.” I’m feeling a lot of dark emeralds, bold pinks, rich browns and creamy whites. One I know for sure, though, is Pantone’s 2022 color of the year: Very Peri, a blue-ish-purple blend just a few shades shy of purple, giving the impression of a mature version of lilac.  
I want to be clear — it’s OK to dress the way you want; that’s what makes style and trends different. For the new year, all I really want is for readers to take time to explore their closets. If it goes bad, no one will really remember except for your Snapchat memories and, probably, your roommate. The last two years have been more than the world has bargained for, and you deserve some fun.
