Sports, science and games are three fields often considered to be “boys’ clubs,” but not at USC, where the gender split in the game design program is equal.
Although there has been a noticeable increase in female gamers, the majority of game designers remain male, leading to overwhelmingly male characters in games. Many believe that the gaming industry is not female-friendly, but the game design programs at USC are shattering this misconception one student at a time.
“In recent years, all the incoming classes have improved in terms of gender split, most notably the B.A. and M.F.A. in the Interactive Media and Games Division, which are 50-50 men and women at both the graduate and undergraduate level,” said Tracy Fullerton, the Chair of the Interactive Media and Games Division at the School of Cinematic Arts.
Fullerton has been a game designer for 25 years. Other than chairing the game design program, she is the Electronic Arts Endowed Chair of Interactive Entertainment, director of the USC Game Innovation Lab and director of USC Games. She also teaches in the School of Cinematic Arts.
The USC Games program is made up of four degree programs — a bachelor of arts in interactive media and games, a bachelor of science in computer science with an emphasis in games, a master of fine arts and master of science in the same fields.
According to Todd Marten’s recent article in the Los Angeles Times, USC admitted 15 men into its graduate track and five women in 2011. In 2015, however, USC admitted 12 women and seven men. In the undergraduate program, seven out of the program’s 27 freshmen were women in 2012. But in 2014, freshmen women outnumbered men 14 to 7, and in 2015 there were equal numbers of men and women.
In 2015, USC also retained its number one spot in the Princeton Review’s “Top 25 Undergraduate Schools to Study Game Design,” followed by University of Utah and Digipen Institute of Technology.
“Students come to USC Games to learn the fundamental design and development skills that it takes to become a world class designer of games,” Fullerton said.
She also said that students learn basic skills such as programming, visual design, interactive design, narrative design, creative and technical direction, audio design, production management and entrepreneurial skills, usability and quality assurance.
USC is number one primarily because of the type of games the students produce. Unlike the games currently available in stores, the USC program’s focus lies in innovation.
“In terms of our student games specifically, there is a real range,” Fullerton said. “Many of them use cutting edge technologies or techniques, others take on innovative ideas and mechanics.”
Part of the reason why students are able to innovate is because, according to Fullerton, they are more willing to take risks.
“We are always working with the students to get them to innovate, to express ideas, and to take risks,” Fullerton said. “Because they are in school and not out in the commercial world, these risks can produce quite imaginative and interesting results that make the games very different from those available commercially.”
Martzi Campos, a masters student in the game design program, echoed Fullerton’s sentiments.
“There’s a big emphasis in the program to push the boundaries of what’s out there,” Campos said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Even the more traditional video-game projects can and do explore new game mechanics and subvert known themes and genres.”
In Campos’ experience, students are encouraged to pursue creative solutions.
“I have never heard ‘no’ when it comes to an out-of-the-box idea,” she said. “My own thesis is focused around entirely physical puzzles, not digital ones, and while most of the work in the program is digital, I never felt like I was out of bounds for perusing work outside that scope.”
Campos earned a B.F.A. from the Rhode Island School of Design, where she studied painting and installation art. Prior to enrolling at USC, she taught preschool art for several years.
Currently, Campos is working on her thesis project, “Beautiful Corner.”
“It is a physical installation built out of two stage walls and a partial ceiling,” Campos said. “Inside of the space are interactive sculpture puzzles, which, as the player solves them, reveal a story about childhood and magic. As the player explores and solves the mysteries of the room, the room itself reacts though sound and lighting.”
Campos drew inspirations for “Beautiful Corner” from room escape games and interactive theater.
“I wanted to create a tangible, reactive, magical world that gives the player a chance to not only observe it, but to become a character in it,” Campos said.
As is the case with many historically male-dominated fields, gender is a major factor in video game development. The USC program had more female students than males in previous years and currently boasts even numbers of both genders.
In recent years, male gamers have often acted as gatekeepers to the gaming world, often perpetuating the harmful stereotype of the “fake geek/gamer girl.” Additionally, the recent incident of Gamergate, where Twitter users harassed prominent female figures in the gaming world, left the gaming community at odds regarding sexism.
“I think that Gamergate was a tragic aberration in the development of the industry towards a more inclusive culture,” Fullerton said. “It’s important to note that this was not coming from inside the industry but from a very small, misguided group of people on the Internet who have no real involvement in the industry at all. The less attention paid to them at this point, the better.”
Women and other student minorities will be able to be agents of change in the future, Fullerton hopes.
“Our environment is extremely open and respectful, so the students are learning in an environment that we hope is how the industry will eventually become,” Fullerton said. “Of course, everyone has worries about their future. I think that our young women and otherwise diverse students hope to be agents of change. They realize that where there is change, there is opportunity.”
Campos also felt that such a bias did not exist in USC’s program.
“I have been lucky enough to never have to face such attitudes in person — I think that means I must keep good company!” Campos said. “The stereotype of a fake gamer girl is still a bit of a specter that can haunt you.”
Campos said that there is an outside societal pressure for women to understand games they are not interested in.
“I think I put pressure on myself sometimes to understand games I am not terribly interested in, just to make sure I can’t get called out for not knowing something,” Campos said. “No one’s putting that pressure on me, but I feel it all the same. It’s more than just the desire to be up-to-date or simply knowledgeable in my field. There is a self-inflicted social pressure to make sure I don’t ‘embarrass’ myself, which is ridiculous, but there it is.”
For Campos, USC’s inclusive program is working to dispel the stereotype of women in the industry.
“As a student you can feel that the program is focused and committed to not only fostering new women into the field but also bringing in inspirational women in the industry to share and learn from,” Campos said.
The program is also groundbreaking in that, soon, USC Games will be publishing the games that students create.
“This first-ever academic publishing label will curate important independent and experimental titles,” Fullerton said.
These games will then be published by USC students on consoles, PC/Mac and mobile.
“USC Games is already known for turning out the highest quality of young game developers and innovative projects, and now we are taking that reputation and extending to the realm of publishing,” Fullerton added.
USC Games will facilitate the launch of student-developed games.
“The publishing process will be independently funded by their developers, and USC Games will offer guidance and quality assurance in getting the projects onto consoles, PR around the launch and a relationship with players built on our existing reputation,” Fullerton said.
Similarly, for Campos, the best aspects of the program are the faculty and staff, a sentiment she believes is shared by her fellow classmates.
“[The faculty and staff] are so talented and truly care about the students the work that they create,” Campos said. “I have had such inspiring and encouraging mentors in my three years in the program.”
 
I am really confused at what the latest popular thinking is as it relates to gender issues. On the one hand many claim gender preferences are a purely socially constructed phenomenon and that males and females would think exactly alike if not for these social forces at work. Well if there isn’t such a thing as a “female brain” and a “male brain” why does it matter the gender makeup of the video game community?
It’s important that woman gamers also have choices in what genders they would want to play, as well. I play a male in WoW simply to get away from the pettiness of boys in that I-hate-girls-stage in their bonding rituals, but I also like to have the option to play either/or (especially in RPGs). I feel that gender specific roles will just be as splitting as only male characters in games, too.
What’s needed is more women in game development to have games OTHER than the CoDs and Battlefields. Really like to see long-term building games in the future, where you build cities and complex societies and work to build communities … things that were touched upon with MMOs that didn’t pan out (as games became more action oriented). It’s now 12 button mice and macros playing, not so much as spreadsheets; thinking strats; or trying to be neighborly anymore. To me, as a woman, that boring. Want to create, design, not simply destroy (100000000001 games already does that). How about PvE version of EvE? You know run complex economies; explore all the stuff being removed from traditional games (like the puzzles; the foraging; the long-term character development)?
I’ve been playing video games since 1976 (Pong on a Sears portable B/W TV in the day). So any idea that women don’t understand gaming or Johnny-come-lately is patently wrong, too. It’s just we came BEFORE Nintendo and their marketing to EXCLUDE girls and women in gaming (as they were into that 15 year-old TOY market sales).
The industry has a lot of work ahead to correct the sins of it’s past. Hopefully, all this will be the past and the small screen medium can shine as the big screens in content and fun, too.
Here’s hope to all you younger gals: let’s see gaming show it’s full potential, not just 50% of it. ^-^
It sounds like an excellent program – I’ve been faced with the difficulty of encouraging gender parity in my own teaching, both at high school and university level, as women only account for 5% of the students involved in our game design courses. To increase that ratio would be a great outcome, and I’m incredibly impressed that USC is achieving these results.
I am consumer and I am king. Developing games costs money, and if people like me won’t buy your games, your company dies. I don’t care if your company is inclusive or not, all I care about if you make good games. The company that made Superhot are all white and male, and their game is selling like super hot cakes, the team that made Sunset were super diverse and ended up in bankruptcy court.
You think Gamers will buy your products if you tell them they’re sexist and harassers? Good luck with that, see how well that strategy worked for Tales of Tales.
It’s nice that you think you are king. You buy games because we make them good, we don’t make games good so you can buy them.
What games? I’ve seen your webpage, there is nothing to suggest you got any marketable skills, and if you did you wouldn’t be playing with beer cans.
Bachelor of Fine Arts Baaahaaahaha!!!! Yes I will have fries with that.
“a very small, misguided group of people on the Internet who have no real involvement in the industry at all. The less attention paid to them at this point, the better.”
– I suspect Fullerton is saying this to convince herself.
Quite right. It’s actually the other way around. Gawker is about gossip, not the video games industry. Intel is about microchips, not the video game industry. Anita is about feminism, not the video game industry. None of the prominent anti-Gamergate people are IN the video game industry, they just want a slice of the economic pie.

The 29 days of Black History Month flew by, but not before one piece of history was able to land on campus. Two Tuskegee Airmen recounted their stories of breaking the color barrier in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II on Monday.
Jerry Hodges and Theodore Lumpkin Jr., who graduated from USC in 1950 and 1947, respectively, were part of the all-black unit in the U.S. military that served as aviators. At the time, the military was segregated, and African Americans were pushed to marginal roles in combat. When the Tuskegee Airmen started training in 1941, it was an experiment on the part of the U.S.
“We thought, what we were doing, we were improving the lots of blacks,” Lumpkin, who worked with military intelligence, said of their service.
The all-black unit received their name from the base where they trained — the Tuskegee Army Air Field in Tuskegee, Alabama. Tuskegee Airmen also included engineers, mechanics and intelligence officers.
The unit’s success is largely credited for paving the way to integration of the whole U.S. military in 1948. Today, the U.S. Air Force is 14 percent African American, according to the Air Force Personnel Center.
Hodges was in his early twenties when he started training with the unit. Now in his 90s and wearing a navy blue Tuskegee Airmen uniform, Hodges said his time in the service remains one of “most rewarding” things in his life.
“If you can really devote yourself to a goal, you can accomplish it,” Hodges said. “Many times there are going to be disappointments, but you can overcome it. Nothing is easy, and nothing is free. You’re going to have to work for it, but it’s worth it.”
Despite their prominence in black history today, the men both agreed that at the time they did not feel like they were writing themselves into the history books.
“History is being made everyday like it’s being made here,” Lumpkin said. “If you do your best each and every time that you can, that history becomes your legacy and hopefully when people look at it in time, it will be something that they will look up to and say, ‘That was a really important thing that happened.’”
The precise number of Tuskegee Airmen is still unknown. Lumpkin says most agree that the number is around 14,000. Many have passed away or are in their late 80s or early 90s.
“There will probably never be another all-black Air Force again because the military was completely segregated,” Lumpkin said. “We have a integrated military that is outstanding. It’s really typical of the Air Force
“We had sharecroppers, farmers and we had Ph.D.s, but we were all on the same level,” Hodges said. “Just the discipline that was enforced on us made us bond together. We still keep in touch.”
Hodges said he still receives an email from one of his comrades every day. Today, both Hodges and Lumpkin are part of the Tuskegee Airmen veteran’s group in Los Angeles.
The Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and the Air Force ROTC Detachment 060 brought the two veterans to campus as part of their Black History Month celebrations. About 20 students, faculty and guests to campus attended the panel.
Tayanna Todd, a sophomore majoring in film and television production and Spanish, said that when she found out that the legendary Tuskegee Airmen would be on campus she knew she had to attend. She has admired the unit’s service since she first heard about them in high school.
“We don’t have many opportunities to have living history right here in our face,” Todd said. “So just having that opportunity to hear them and listen to them and see them and continue to have that history right there presented to us is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”
Though Hodges and Lumpkin said they did not realize their impact while they were serving as young men, they are grateful to be able to see the progress the country has made in terms of racial equality.
“It’s good to still be around, I’m pleased with that,” Lumpkin said.

El Centro Chicano and the Office of the Provost welcomed Cuban neuroscientist, Pedro Valdes-Sosa, to speak about Cuban-American relationships on Monday in Seeley G. Mudd hall.
The lecture was the first event of the Latino Last Lecture series, where prominent speakers will showcase their professional, personal and cultural life experiences, answering the question, “If you could only give one last lecture, what would you say?”
Valdes-Sosa is the general vice director for research of the Cuban Neurosciences Center and also a member of the editorial boards of publications such as Neuroimage, Meddic and Audiology and Neurotology.
During the lecture, Valdes-Sosa mentioned many of his career accomplishments when the field of neuroscience was emerging, which include studying wavelengths and detecting correlations between people’s health and personalities. Valdes-Sosa also developed a program to track brain waves during a coma using a personal computer.
The overall theme of the lecture was the importance of using science to benefit society and the question of how scientific accomplishments will be achieved now that the embargo between the United States and Cuba has been lifted.
The U.S. and Cuba had limited interaction within the last 50 years. Valdes-Sosa explained that the Cuban Neurosciences Center has contributed significantly to Cuba’s overall economy.
“We have a country with very little resources, so we began institutions that would create production and input in the economy,” Valdes-Sora said.
While the Cuban Neurosciences Center is involved in various research projects, it also engages in projects that provide the Cuban people with healthcare services.
“We have production facilities where we create hearing aids through 3D printing. We do research, but are also involved in production,” Valdes-Sosa said.
Many of the people that attended the event expressed interest because they wanted to hear a professional’s insight, especially because of his experience as a doctor.
“As a human biology major, I wished to listen to the insight of a professional with a background in medicine,” said freshman Melissa Wenceslao. “With his insight, I felt like I could pursue my studies further, especially since he is a Latino.”
Others were motivated to learn more about Cuba.
“My friends and I are taking a trip to Cuba for spring break, and wanted to learn more about the country,” said Michael Thorson, a sophomore majoring in aerospace engineering. “We wanted to get a completely new perspective,”
Braulio Hoyos, a junior double majoring in public policy and development and geodesign said that the lecture resonated with the topics he is exposed to in his classes.
“In my PPD classes, we usually talk about how, if you have a plan for the youth and the elderly, you have a plan for everyone,” Hoyos said. “Overall, I found that this lecture reinforced this idea, and it encouraged me to do good for society.”
Valdes-Sosa concluded his lecture by making remarks on the importance of implementing preventative measures and establishing a reliable healthcare system.
“We have to be concerned that preventive measures and primary healthcare cannot be subject to private interests,” Valdes-Sosa said. “If we were able to do so much before when there were barriers, what can we do now?”

After a commanding 5-2 win over Stanford in Palo Alto last weekend, the Trojans will head to Westwood Tuesday to face UCLA at the Los Angeles Tennis Center.
They will try and secure back-to-back road victories against Pac-12 teams in nonconference matches.
Both teams look as strong as expected this season, with UCLA posting a ranking of fourth in the nation, while USC sits at 13th and is likely to rise after the win over Stanford.
The Trojans faced some adversity to begin the match after losing the doubles point to go down 1-0 early. They then rattled off five consecutive singles match wins to clinch the match before a loss in a third set tiebreaker for the second loss of the day for USC.
Junior Nick Crystal tied the match-up with a straight sets win, and freshman Jake Devine continued his stellar debut  season after finishing a third set win, 6-1. Sophomore Thibault Forget clinched the match with the Trojans’ fourth singles win in another three-setter, and senior Max de Vroome pulled off a big upset over Stanford’s Tom Fawcett, the fourth-ranked player in the country. The Trojans hope to ride this momentum into this rivalry match and a difficult schedule against many top teams across the country.
The Bruins provide a challenging matchup with their top three players: junior Mackenzie McDonald, sophomore Martin Redlicki and junior Gage Brymer are all top-50 players in the country. McDonald leads the team with experience as a junior ranked 19th in the nation who has not only succeeded at UCLA but has also won some lower-level professional matches. The Bruins also have senior Karue Sell, their fourth nationally ranked player at 94. The Bruins’ talented group has led them to a 9-2 record on the season, which brings an additional challenge in the rivalry match.
The Trojans counter with an array of solid players for the difficult challenge the Bruins will bring. De Vroome is coming off his biggest win of the year in the Stanford match and will be playing one of the top singles slots for the Trojans with a ranking of 65th nationally. Crystal is just behind de Vroome at 67th in the country, adding an early Pac-12 Player of the Week award this season to an already strong resume in his first two seasons at USC. Freshman Logan Smith boasts the Trojans’ top ranking with a mark of 56th nationally and will try to add yet another win to his young career. Rounding out the Trojans singles players are the freshman duo of DeVine and Jack Jaede as well as experienced sophomore Forget.
USC brings a young team to the table, but so far this season the inexperience has been far overshadowed by the talent of these players as well as the leadership of the veterans on the team. The Trojans hope to repeat the success they had against the Bruins last season, winning both matches on each team’s home court during the regular season and beating them in the Pac-12 tournament for a three-match sweep.
Correction: This post originally appeared with the title “Fourth-ranked men’s tennis set for battle at UCLA.” The men’s tennis team is ranked 13th. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
Your headline is way off. It reads like the Trojans are 4th ranked. What were you thinking?
It was a mistake, chill out.

After grabbing their first series win over the weekend, USC baseball makes the short trip to Long Beach Tuesday to take on Long Beach State.
The Trojans. who are 4-3, have finally pushed themselves into a winning record, taking two of three against a plucky Wake Forest team, and they now look to pick up some momentum going into the Dodger Stadium Classic, which kicks off Friday.
USC struggled with leaving men on base against the Demon Deacons, but head coach Dan Hubbs was encouraged by the scoring opportunities his team was generating. The Trojans racked up 27 hits over the first two games of the series.
“When you see the number of guys we had on base in the first two games, I think we’re really close [offensively],” Hubbs said.
The Trojans were also lackluster in the field at times against Wake Forest, including their three errors in the ninth inning Saturday, which plated the Demon Deacons’ winning run. Sophomore third baseman Adalberto Carrillo said the squad needed to sharpen up before the trip to Long Beach.
“Some of our technique has been sloppy,” he said. “We just have to go back to practice … because we can’t be missing in situations like that.”
On the defensive side of things, the third week of the season also sets the stage for a position battle between shortstops Angelo Armenta and Reggie Southall. Armenta manned the position during the weekend series against Wake Forest after redshirt junior Southall began the season as the starter.
“It’ll be a competition between the two of them,” Hubbs said. “We have to get some sort of offensive production out of that spot.”
Hubbs praised Armenta’s play over the weekend but also said Southall would get another crack at earning a spot in the lineup in the near future.
It is clear that the Trojans are still working out some kinks early on in the season. Some may be disappointed, especially when comparing this year to USC’s blistering start to the 2015 campaign, but senior pitcher Brent Wheatley was happy with the team’s progress.
“Last year we started 16-0, but that’s not going to happen each and every year,” Wheatley said. “Most of the time, you’re going to play worse early in the year … [but] I think we’re getting into the swing of things.”
USC visits a Long Beach State team off to a hot start to its season, already sporting impressive series wins against Holy Cross and Arizona State as well as a win on the road against UCLA. The Dirtbags are 5-2 overall on the year, and they will hope their early season success is not a repeat of last year, when Long Beach won nine of its first 12 games before barely finishing the season with a winning record at 28-26.
Going into another tough matchup, junior catcher Jeremy Martinez stressed the need for the team to stay upbeat and not to pile pressure on themselves.
“We don’t play well when we’re uptight,” Martinez said. “Our team plays best when we’re having fun and when we’re relaxed.”
First pitch between the Trojans and the Dirtbags at Blair Field will be at 6 p.m. Tuesday.

Spring is quickly approaching and with it comes the dawn of another season of football. USC announced Monday that spring football practice will begin March 8, and the spring game will take place on April 16 at the Coliseum.
There will be 14 practices in total leading up to the spring game, and all but one will be held at Howard Jones Field. The team will practice at the Coliseum on March 26.
Practices, all of which are open to fans, are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:30 p.m. and Saturdays at 10 a.m. They will run every other day from early March until mid-April except for a one-week break during spring break.
Tickets for the spring game cost $10. Attendance for last season’s game at the Coliseum was 22,788, which ranked 16th in the country and second in the Pac-12 behind Oregon, which drew 35,808 attendees.
Sandwiched in between spring practices is USC’s pro day, which will be Mar. 23 at 10 a.m.
The Trojans enter the 2016 season with a fresh slate in head coach Clay Helton’s first full season at the helm, a new quarterback and assistant coaching staff and a stockpile of talented recruits. Seven of those recruits, who are already registered for classes this spring semester, will be able to participate in the workouts.
USC opens its season against defending national champion Alabama on Sept. 3.

USC was well represented at the NFL Scouting Combine that began last week and concluded Monday, with seven Trojans participating in workouts and interviews at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis with hopes of impressing NFL teams.
The Trojans were represented by junior linebacker Su’a Cravens, redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler, redshirt senior running back Tre Madden, redshirt senior fullback Soma Vainuku, senior center Max Tuerk, redshirt senior defensive lineman Antwaun Woods and senior cornerback Kevon Seymour, all of whom played key roles during their time at USC.
Kessler ran the 40-yard dash in 4.89 seconds and posted a 29.5-inch vertical and a 104-inch broad jump, which don’t jump off the page. He showed off his throwing arm well, however, and is projected to be a late-round pick. Kessler also has been working on another aspect of his game.
“For me, the mental side of it is something that is big, being able to recognize defenses,” Kessler told the Orange County Register. “Obviously everyone can throw and everyone can play at the next level, but for me, I’ve always wanted to be a step ahead of everyone on the mental side of it.”
Cravens, projected to be one of the Trojans’ higher draft picks, chose not to run a 40-yard dash on the advice of his agent and trainer. He received mixed reviews, with his 27-inch vertical leap ranking worst among linebackers along with a below-average 16 reps on the bench press. Still, Cravens passed the so-called “eye-test” for athleticism and was impressive during drills and team interviews.
Cravens believes that just because he’s a USC product doesn’t give him a free pass to a high draft slot.
“I’ve been asked if I’m a prima donna,” Cravens told the Register. “I get that, coming from ‘SC. People think a lot of ‘SC guys are entitled, but things have changed since the glory days. I think I’m a hard-working guy.”
Madden and Tuerk, who were both hampered by injuries last season, will seek to prove themselves at the next level. Madden finished second among running backs with 24 reps in the bench press, but his participation was limited to just the one event. Tuerk, who saw his season end early due to a torn ACL, posted 22 reps and weighed in at 298 pounds, 13 more than what is listed by USC.
His ability to play center, guard and tackle may be an asset for NFL teams.
“It was absolutely a positive,” Tuerk told the Los Angeles Times. “It shows that I’m versatile and able to play anywhere on the line.”
Vainuku, who by far had the most creative haircut at the combine, also impressed with 26 bench reps, the third most for fullbacks. He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.68 seconds, ranking second for his position.
As for the remaining defensive players, Seymour, who received inconsistent playing time last season, recorded a 40-yard dash time of 4.39 seconds, the fastest by a Trojan in a decade. Woods did not participate but was present at the combine.
The next chance the prospects have to showcase their skills for teams will be USC’s pro day on March 23. The NFL Draft will take place from April 28-30 in Chicago.

The Pac-12 chose two Trojans to be featured on the All-Pac-12 women’s basketball team, which was announced Monday.
Graduate forward Temi Fagbenle earned a spot on the team after her first and only season as a Trojan and junior guard Courtney Jaco was given an honorable mention. The all-conference team honors the top 15 players and also awarded 13 players with honorable mentions.
Fagbenle came to USC after finishing an undergraduate degree at Harvard and playing on the 2012 British Olympic women’s basketball team. This season, she notched nine double-doubles while leading the team in scoring with an average of 13.6 points per game.
She also led the Trojans in blocks with 1.2 per game and rebounds with 8.5 per game. After leading the team to upset UCLA earlier in the season, she was named Pac-12 Player of the Week. As a team captain, Fagbenle helped to open the season with 12 straight wins and her presence was consistently impactful as she scored in double figures for 21 games and rebounded in double digits for 11 games.
After switching from a shooting guard to the point guard in the absence of senior Brianna Barrett, Jaco has become a leader this season. She leads the team in steals with 1.8 per game and provides 2.1 assists and a perfect 21-for-21 record from the free throw line. From long distance, Jaco has already scored 66 3-point shots this season and is fifth in all-time Trojan history with 139 career 3s. She was also named a Pac-12 All-Academic Honorable Mention last year.

Undergraduate Student Government Program Board’s Academic Culture Assembly hosted InspirED: EdMonth Kick-Off Festival Monday, an arts festival with the goal of highlighting the importance of art and other underappreciated subjects in education. On a February afternoon in McCarthy Quad, students from both USC and the greater Los Angeles area were invited to the event to celebrate the arts with the main goal of bridging theses two communities.
InspirED is a part of EdMonth, which is a student-led program and campaign devoted to raising awareness about the state of education in our country, hosting a wide variety of events throughout March that promotes  educational exploration, providing students with the tools necessary to contribute to educational justice.
“This event is incredibly meaningful to me because it starts off EdMonth by prioritizing underappreciated and often-silenced topics in education, which is something I focused on as director for the entire month,” said EdMonth Director and Academic Culture Assembly Assistant Director Luis Vidalon-Suzuki.
Walking into McCarthy Quad, students were given a sheet of paper for signatures, so that if they visited three tables at the festival, they could receive a free Coolhaus ice cream sandwich, courtesy of the Coolhaus truck onsite. Likewise, the event also featured a series of chalkboards, where attendees could write answers to the question, “What was missing in your education?” in response to the fact that art is consistently one of the first programs to be cut in the public school system due to lack of funding and support. Organizations that tabled at the festival included the USC Helenes, Program Board, Special Events Committee, the Young Storytellers Foundation, 826LA, Ryman Arts and Piece by Piece.
“From my experience, art heals everything,” said Betty Rosen Ziff, a Piece by Piece art instructor that attended the event.
Piece by Piece is a non-profit organization in South L.A. that holds free art classes and workshops to the homeless and economically disadvantaged. The goal of the organization is to bring the arts to those who lack the money or education to experience them and instill confidence. They create the art using recycled materials and aim to improve the lives of these individuals with their philantrophy.
The InspirED festival brought forth and raised awareness for issues on education and the role that the arts play. The festival served as a way to celebrate an under-appreciated course of study at USC.

Folk band Run River North just released its sophomore album, Drinking From A Salt Pond, this past Friday, capturing the attention of many with their breathtaking harmonies and clever arrangements. Made up of six L.A. natives, with one USC alum, Daniel Chae, on vocals and violin, the band can be seen this Tuesday at the Telegram Ballroom in downtown L.A., with opener The Wild Reeds.
After the show, they hit the road for a national tour throughout March and April in support of the new album, playing many notable venues and the popular music festival, SXSW, in Austin. The band recently finished a North American tour opening for Relient K, and have played throughout L.A., with previous shows at the Levitt Pavilion, Grand Park, the Troubadour and more.
Run River North, formerly known as Monsters Calling Home, formed in 2011 when lead singer Alex Hwang wanted to compete in an L.A. music competition. He reached out to a small circle of musicians in the Korean-American community, and thus the band was formed. After the competition, they continued playing with each other. Band members include Chae (vocals, strings, electric guitar), Alex Hwang (lead vocals, guitar), Jennifer Rim (strings), Joe Chun (bass, vocals), John Chong (drums, vocals) and Sally Kang (vocals, keyboards).
Their music can be described as folk rock and alternative, very similar to Of Monsters and Men, but with influences from bands like Arcade Fire, the National and Cage the Elephant, whose influences are clearly heard in the new album Drinking From A Salt Pond. Working with producer Lars Stalfors, who also worked with Cold War Kids, Deap Vally, HEALTH and Matt and Kim, the new album takes a step back from the folk melodies of the first album and welcomes electric guitars and heavier drums, with songs like “Run or Hide” and “Pretender.” However, fans of the first album won’t be disappointed with Drinking From A Salt Pond, as many of the songs feature the beautiful arrangements, harmonies and violin parts associated with the band’s sound, with tracks like “Winter Winds” providing soft and striking melodies.
Run River North has been an inspiration to the Asian-American community. Yet, when the band was first establishing itself, they faced challenges as many people hadn’t seen six Koreans playing folk rock music together before. A popular band comprised of all Asian Americans that isn’t K-Pop is actually very rare. Nevertheless, when people hear the amazing music coming from the band, most judgements disappear because of their undeniable talent.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Run River North said they were excited to play the new album on their upcoming tour and see their fans’ reactions to the new direction they’re taking. In the future, they hope to continue touring around the world and play major festivals, like Outside Lands, growing their fanbase and sharing their talents with thousands. With an amazing sophomore album and a national tour set, a lot of great things are ahead for Run River North this year.

Frank Gehry, a 1954 graduate of USC, currently has an exhibit on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The exhibition captured the life’s work of the influential and acclaimed architect.
There were seven different galleries, each pertaining to a specific epoch of his career. The first gallery, De-composition | Segmentation, focused on Gehry’s work from 1965-1980. Gehry was born in Toronto, Canada, in 1929 and later began his career as an architect in Los Angeles. His obsession with architecture led him to create some of the most ambitious designs, landing him the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1989. Since receiving this award, Gehry’s work has continued to grow. A rebellious renegade, Gehry has revolutionized architecture.
After opening his office in Santa Monica in 1962, Gehry began his career designing projects for developers and urban-planning agencies. Using his knowledge of construction, Gehry reinvented the idea of the architectural object. It was surreal to see the stages of Gehry’s projects through the progression of his sketches and through the final model structures. Starting with simple line and shape, the sketches thereafter gained dimension, perspective and style. His sketches showed every nimble movement of his hand. If standing close enough, you could see the marks he erased and meticulously redrew. He sometimes wrote down words on sketches, which offered insight into his structural ideas for the buildings. On one of his final sketches of the Spiller Residence, in Venice, Calif., were the words “tunnel for ocean view?” After gaping at the transformational sketches and the model structures, the final projection of the projects were captivating.
The second gallery, Composition | Assemblage, was a collection of Gehry’s work from 1980-1990. At this stage in his career, Gehry began to create discrete, heterogeneous structures, as he was influenced by the concept of a “one-room building.” Gehry’s practice of creating model structures increased in his more intricate designs and use of materials. He used conventional materials in unconventional ways, which no architect had done before. For example, he used a stack of flat cardboard boxes to represent mountains on which the residences stood. The cardboard, so meticulously carved and manipulated, looked close to the real thing.
His work done between 1990-2000 was split into two different galleries: Interaction | Fusion and Conflict | Tension. In the Interaction | Fusion gallery, Gehry revived the principle of continuity in his structures, as was evident in his design for the Lewis Residence, in which he combined structure, material, envelope and ornament through the creation of a stainless steel roof made out of fabric dipped in wax. Gehry also began to use the new software system, CATIA (Computer Aided Three-Dimensional Interactive Application), to accurately produce his architecture. In the Conflict | Tension gallery, Gehry’s fascination with tension and attraction was evident in his work. His structures contained contradiction, clashes, abrupt changes and conflicts — echoing the heterogenous nature of the city.
At the turn of the century, Gehry began two new enterprises, illustrated in the Flux | Continuity gallery, which features his work on from 2000-2010, and the Unity | Singularity gallery, from 2000-2015. In the early 2000s, Gehry began to explore metallic materials. His interest in continuous metallic structures was put into work in his construction of Chicago’s Millennium Park and New York’s Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts. After, Gehry questioned the identity of the architectural object. He simplified chaotic forms, and unified them into beautiful structures. His work has resulted in iconic buildings, such as the Üstra Office Building in Germany and the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris.
The last gallery, In The Studio Now, was breathtaking. Gehry’s current projects encompass the diversity of all his past projects. Among the projects were private residences, concert halls, corporate headquarters and art museums.  Mesmerized by the bold colors and intricate shapes, this gallery distinguished itself from the others as the most advanced in design. On the back wall of this gallery was a giant panoramic image of his office, in which his assistants are pictured working on the projects present in the gallery.
In addition to the galleries containing his work, there was a showing of Sketches of Frank Gehry, the 2006 documentary about Gehry’s work. After sitting through the entire one hour and 24 minutes of the documentary, the exhibit looked incredibly different. Revisiting sketches and models with Gehry’s vision in mind, the miniscule details now seemed so apparent. As the documentary continued to play on a loop, Gehry’s voice echoed throughout Resnick Pavilion, giving the illusion of his presence. However, Gehry did not need to be present for his vision to come through in his work. His architecture, so idiosyncratic in nature, spoke for itself.
Gehry’s honesty resonated with me. “I’m always scared that I’m not gonna know what to do. It’s a terrifying moment. And then when I start, I’m always amazed. So, that wasn’t so bad,” Gehry said in his documentary.
Frank Gehry will be speaking on Wednesday at LACMA. There is a 6 p.m. reception, 6:45 p.m. talk and 7:30 p.m. exhibit.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the Frank Gehry exhibit is on display at the Los Angeles Contemporary Museum of Art. It is the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Last weekend, I went on a date. Having suffered a recent heartbreak following a disastrous five-month quasi-relationship, I’ve been keeping a low profile within L.A.’s gay dating scene. Or rather, I’ve kept no profile at all, having deleted all dating apps from my phone in hopes of deflecting any form of temptation. However, regardless of my efforts, I found myself arriving at a bar downtown, close to the Walt Disney Concert Hall, preparing for what I was sure to be a casual first date.
In general, I hate dating, especially the early stages of seeing someone new. There is so much pressure to look and act a certain way, when in reality, all I long for is to find someone to stay at home with and watch the Metropolitan Opera on demand with one or four bottles of wine. And though I’ve enjoyed doing this exact activity with my cat on a semi-regular basis, I thought perhaps that a bit of socialization was exactly what I needed to bring myself out of this funk of self-deprecation.
Having gone on as many first dates as I have, I’ve noticed patterns in the series of events that arise on each date. For one, the first 10 minutes of the date are a bit uncomfortable, with both of us trying to ease the tension of first-date awkwardness with polite small talk and flirtatious body language. But regardless of the slight uneasiness present between both of us, things seemed perfectly lovely … that is, until the topic of music arose.
“So, what kind of music are you into?” my date asked.
To be frank, I hate this question. Though music is a huge part of my life, and though there is nothing I would love more than to spend an entire night discussing music, it is exponentially difficult to find another with similar music tastes. No one else seems as keen to discuss Verdi’s profound influence on Italian opera as I am. Most of the time, whenever I discuss classical music, I can see the others’ eyes glaze over, attempting to mask their apathy with forced enthusiasm. Still, I answered him honestly and told him that though I enjoy a broad range of musical genres, I primarily listen to classical music.
“Oh, okay, cool. So like Mozart and stuff?” he responded.
“Yeah … Mozart and stuff,” I said.
It usually surprises people when I tell them that my musical universe revolves around classical music, seeing as it’s not exactly the genre of choice for most millennials. At this point, you’d think that I would already have rehearsed responses pertaining to all the questions about classical music that are inevitably going to be asked. Likewise, it is usually within these moments when I decipher if the relationship will work out or not. I am the first to acknowledge that I am a complete music snob. Having grown up a classical musician, music has had such a profound influence on my life and has molded my personality to what it is today. Therefore, I take music very seriously and take slight pride in my high standards for musical taste. But I also understand that classical music is not everyone’s cup of tea. I don’t expect the others to be as gung ho about it as I am, but I would like to eventually meet a guy who doesn’t acknowledge Josh Groban as his favorite opera singer.
I realize I have unrealistic standards when it comes to dating. However, I’ve never really understood the point of settling for a subpar date; though I do acknowledge that some people enjoy the meaninglessness and spontaneity of nonchalant dating, I’ve only ever accepted dates with those that I can imagine having some sort of meaningful exchange with. There is a fine line between what is deemed as accepting one’s unfavorable attributes and settling altogether. I am still trying to find this line myself, but perhaps casual dating isn’t the worst thing in the world. Maybe opening myself up to a broader spectrum of tastes and interests will help melt my frigid demeanor.
Despite the musical blunders that took place early on in the evening, overall, we had a fine evening. After a slightly more eventful latter half of the date, followed by a charming though somewhat awkward goodbye the following morning, relaxing (though not eliminating) my standards is probably beneficial in the long run. What I’ve taken away from this experience is that finding quality sometimes requires weeding through quantities of men. And though I don’t necessarily see this relationship blossoming, I’m content with my ability to enjoy myself without the prospect of a relationship.

One doesn’t have to walk very far along the streets of Los Angeles — or even those surrounding our own University Park Campus — to recognize that affordable housing and homelessness are two of Los Angeles’ most serious crises. And come Nov. 8, voters will finally have the chance to move both issues to the forefront of the city’s agenda by voting for the “Build Better LA” initiative.
Of the proposals on the ballot, the “Build Better LA” initiative is the only one that truly seeks to address Los Angeles’ housing crisis by focusing on Los Angeles’ poorest — and increasingly homeless — residents. Presently, the city bears a housing deficit of approximately 1,000,000 units, an issue which has led to a rising approximate homeless population of at least 44,000 Angelenos — many of whom are resigned to living on the streets or in vehicles. The high cost of housing is cited as the primary cause behind this rise in homelessness, marked by a 12 percent increase over the last two years alone.
It is exactly this housing and homelessness crisis that “Build Better LA” has the potential to ameliorate. Under the proposal, which has been backed by a coalition of labor unions and housing advocates, real estate projects that include residential units would be required to allocate a certain percentage to low-income housing, with different classifications depending on the median income of the area. Specifically, developers would have the choice to allocate 5 percent and 6 percent of their residential units to “extremely low-income” and “very low-income” tenants, respectively, or allocate 5 percent of units to “extremely low-income” tenants and 15 percent to “low-income” tenants.
Such an initiative wouldn’t bar housing expansion, as measures like the “Neighborhood Integrity” initiative have proposed, calling for a moratorium on construction altogether. Rather, the Build Better LA would ensure that Los Angeles’ expansion continues to grow — both responsibly and equitably. By mandating that certain residential projects include affordable housing for low-income tenants, the proposal has the potential to meet and exceed Los Angeles’ current goal of producing 500 affordable housing units per year.
But just as the ballot measure seeks to address the affordable housing deficit in Los Angeles, it doesn’t ignore the important role that affordable wages play in ensuring that lower-income residents can afford rising rent costs. In addition to mandating that developers allocate units for affordable housing, it also requires that a certain percentage of the construction jobs go to Angelenos — thereby ensuring that upcoming developments aren’t just being built for local residents but by them.
Los Angeles wouldn’t be the only city to put in place similar measures aimed at keeping housing affordable. Neighboring areas such as Santa Monica and Pasadena have both implemented their own inclusionary requirements mandating residential developers to offer affordable housing. In Santa Monica, 30 percent of all new housing developments must be affordable to households making 80 percent of the area’s median income or less.
Los Angeles’ housing crisis certainly won’t be solved overnight, and 500 units a year are a far cry from the type of development the city needs to address its housing demands. But the Build Better LA initiative is a bold step in the right direction, and the only one that promises to support continued housing development in a way that benefits all Angelenos.

Los Angeles is a city of excess — too much traffic, too much smog and too much self-awareness. Although its constant state of demand keeps it hungry and extremely ambitious, L.A. is plagued by a basic crisis of economics: Too many people want too many things. Nowhere is this steep demand more exemplified than by the city’s high median rent, which ranks the ninth-highest in the nation for one-bedroom apartments. Seeking to rectify L.A.’s extremely exorbitant rent, which increased by 11.6 percent in 2015, the Coalition to Preserve L.A. and the Build Better L.A. Initiative are introducing well-intentioned but fundamentally misguided measures to the 2016 ballot.
An evaluation of the measures requires an understanding of L.A.’s unique real estate landscape. In 2015, rent increased almost everywhere, except for some of the wealthiest parts of L.A., such as Bel Air, the Palisades and Hollywood Hills West. By contrast, less wealthy areas of L.A., such as our own South Central, had almost no vacancies, signifying a desperate need of housing development in those regions. In fact, the 90007 zip code was one of just four total in the county with median apartment rent surpassing $3,000 per month. All this signifies that, save for the wealthiest areas of Los Angeles, the city needs more housing immediately.
The Coalition to Preserve L.A. measure, known as the Neighborhood Integrity Initiative, would “impose a moratorium on construction that increases development density for up to two years” and remove the city’s right to make exceptions for community plans and zoning codes. This initiative has the unique distinction of being misguided both in its target and its methodology. First and most importantly, L.A.’s several-hundred-page, decades-old zoning code is infamously outdated and counterintuitive, actually encouraging economic stratification in its housing developments. Second, making it harder to develop new housing projects makes housing even more unaffordable.
The Build Better L.A. measure requires developers to offer a certain percentage of “affordable” units of housing in projects with 10 or more residential units and hire a specific number of local workers. This measure ignores the fact that having “affordable” housing in areas five miles removed from the Metro, such as the Hills or the Palisades, is entirely impractical for the low-income worker, who will in many cases require public transit and in most cases, will be working in less wealthy areas.
Mayor Eric Garcetti has already publicly lambasted the Neighborhood Integrity Initiative for its stagnating development, asserting the very pressing truth that “we still need to build things in Los Angeles.” These measures, both alone and in tandem, will create a catastrophic housing shortage, especially in low-income regions with vacancy rates of two percent and under. Those actually advocating for L.A.’s citizens would be better off restructuring the zoning code and incentivizing housing development because, as any introduction to economics course will tell you, increasing supply will drive down prices.
Los Angeles will always want more of everything. Instead of running against the growing waves of consumer demand, voters must encourage measures which create a housing market that can rise to the challenge of demand, instead of operating in a delusion that ignores basic laws of supply and demand.

With a new NFL stadium in Inglewood in the works, the region’s upcoming economic revitalization should be accompanied by a renewed interested in its education system. More specifically, Los Angeles Unified School District has the opportunity to develop innovative, district-run charter schools to combat a weak public education system. For a large district like LAUSD, charter schools can facilitate a shift toward a performance-based system and provide competition within the public school system, ultimately creating a higher quality educational environment.
Charter schools encourage the development and use of innovative teaching methods, create professional development programs for teachers to continue their education and increase learning opportunities for all pupils. Moreover, these institutions are better able to hold schools accountable for meeting measurable pupil outcomes by implementing  performance-based accountability. Not only do students within these schools benefit, but charter schools provide competition within the public school system in order to contribute to improvements in all public schools within the district.
A recent study from the National Charter School Study by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford University found that charter schools benefit minorities and poor families the most. The study notes that “black students gained the equivalent of 14 days of learning by attending charter schools but that black students living in poverty saw even greater benefits, the equivalent of 29 days in reading and 36 days in math.” In addition, though Hispanics attending charter schools scored similar to Hispanics in traditional public schools on state exams, Hispanic English-Language learners saw even higher gains. Given that Los Angeles County has 65 percent enrollment of Hispanic students in school, and 33 percent of students in school are English-Language learners, charter schools can bring much-needed help to minority students who might otherwise fall behind in a traditional public school. By reaching high-need students, charter schools can also bridge the social and wealth equity gaps found in underserved minority communities.
Opponents of charter schools argue that they take away the best students from the traditional public schools, reduce resources for such schools and provide no real student improvement. However, under AB 544, charter schools are required to admit all pupils like public schools do, and when demand exceeds capacity, select students by random drawing. The only exception is that preferences be given to students already at the charter school, which allows pupils and families to stay at one school until graduation.
Consequently, according to research conducted by the RAND Corporation, random selection of students ensures that charter schools do not skim high-achieving students away from traditional public schools. Moreover, charter schools do not reduce resources for traditional public schools. Under AB 544, they only receive funding that would be available to a similar school district serving a similar pupil population. Finally, according to the National Charter School Study by Stanford University, charter school students surpass those in regular public schools in reading gains, though they have similar scores in math.
Many charter school opponents  do not fully realize the huge benefits they could bring to LAUSD. Even the District itself has come to understand that “charter schools are valuable partners and viable choices among the District’s robust set of educational options, and they are an integral method of achieving its [the District’s] vision and mission.”
Charter schools give individual schools more freedom over curriculum and instruction, which allow them to better serve specific communities like gifted students or low-income families. Furthemore, they have the independence to try new forms of teaching to experiment with the best way educate to their students, which increases the amount of students they attract. This freedom, in turn, creates accountability  because charter schools must attract students and successfully teach them in order to be sustainable.
Not only will charter schools help underserved communities within Los Angeles County, but they also will create greater accountability for other traditional public schools in South Los Angeles, closing the achievement gap for even more students. LAUSD stands to benefit from expanding charter schools within the district, creating a truly sustainable force of economic growth.

The Oscar’s is the pinnacle of red carpet events in the land of fame and fortune. It is “the denouement” of all red carpet events and all red carpet coverage, according to The New York Times. Last night, celebrities pulled all the stops for a coveted spot on the best-dressed list. See the red carpet trends that either put celebrities on top or fell flat.

Snowy-white dresses dominated the red carpet last night at the 88th Academy Awards. Lady Gaga was a show-stopper, rocking a one-of-a-kind sleek Brandon Maxwell jumpsuit. Olivia Wilde resembled a modern-day Cleopatra in a revealing white pleated Valentino number, complemented by a silver choker. Rooney Mara floated down the red carpet in this intricate Givenchy lace button up with a diamond panel. Priyanka Chopra sauntered down the red carpet with confidence in this sexy sheer Zuhair Murad number. 
Black Isn’t Back

Back to Black? Maybe not. These starlets donned the red carpet in pitch black garbs that just fell flat in comparison to the dazzling whites and vibrant colors. Jared Leto and Amy Poehler attempted to spruce up their plain black ensembles with bright garish details: Leto opting for a gaudy rose instead over a classic bow-tie to complement his Gucci suit while Poehler wore an Andrew GN black cape dress adorned with sequined butterflies and flowers. J-Law’s layered Dior Haute Couture Gown washed her out, while Kate Winslet’s shiny Ralph Lauren drew unwanted attention.
Less Is More

These celebrities graced the red carpet in gorgeous sumptuous gowns in a myriad of colors, demonstrating that less is truly more. Charlize Theron stuns the crowd in a striking red Dior Haute Couture Dress with a plunging neckline.  Rachel McAdams is the picture of perfection in this jewel toned August Getty Atelier Gown with a sultry slit detail. Meanwhile, Olivia Munn looked absolutely sublime in a warm one-shoulder Stella McCartney number.

Red carpet spectators briefly experienced some serious red carpet déjà vu, with stars donning strikingly similar ensembles. Henry Cavill and Eddie Redmayne both walked down the red carpet looking quite dapper in black velvet blazer ensembles, complete with bow-ties. Meanwhile, Tina Fey and Reese Witherspoon both attended the 88th Academy Awards in almost identical royal purple strapless gowns. If you thought having the same dress as another girl at prom was your worst nightmare, try the Oscars red carpet.

Hi Tiffany!
I am a senior, graduating in May (LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS AAAHHH!!!).
I need your advice. I’m trying to live up my senior year as best I can, but I sometimes feel like I am drowning in a pile of work. I thought senior year was supposed to be fun and carefree? I need advice on how to prioritize. List of anxieties include unemployment, leaving my best friends after college, unemployment, GPA, adulting, unblazed trail that is the future…Maybe I just need stress management advice? Don’t know if this is your area of expertise, but maybe just acknowledgement that I am not crazy will be plenty.
Wow, are you my psyche? Did I subconsciously submit an Ask Tiff to myself???
You’re not crazy. It is incredibly taxing to juggle all of those stressors and still make time for a social life. I’m definitely no expert on how to do so successfully (read: while retaining sanity), but here are a few things that have given me solace:
1. Your semester GPA probably doesn’t matter at this point. Yeah, yeah, maintaining that killer GPA is important, but by second semester senior year, there is no point in running yourself into the ground over it. Your GPA is not going to change much unless you flunk everything… which is hard to do…ha-ha, right…?
2. So what if you don’t have a job after graduation? I am constantly checking myself to remember that travelling, working part time, spending time with friends and family or a summer finishing your lease out in L.A. is certainly far from the worst thing ever.
3. The fun stuff is important. You’re right about the friends — you’re never going to get all of these amazing people in the same two square mile area again. But there’s no point wallowing in your sorrow when there’s nothing that can be done about it. What you can do is take advantage of the ten weeks you have left by enjoying their company, whether it’s making time for wine nights at home or spontaneous weekend camping. After graduation, you’ll see the people that really matter again.
Even with your best attempts, this semester might be a sinusoidal wave of times when you’re feeling on top of it all, and times where you feel like you might implode. But riding this rollercoaster is still better than living in a rabbit hole of despair. Focus on the things that will still matter a year from now (i.e. your friends, your mental health, potentially having a job), but be okay when things don’t go as planned.

Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
From break ups to make ups and everything in between, “Love U” captures the nuances of college students’ relationships. “Love U” runs in DeeTs on Mondays.
I don’t remember the first time I met her. It must have been some time freshman year — we lived in the same building and had mutual friends — but we became friends sophomore year. We went to a concert together at LA Live and had quite the adventure trying to return to campus on the Metro, since no cabs would take us the short distance to campus and Uber had not yet achieved ubiquity. I remember contemplating kissing her in the lobby of Troy when we said our goodbyes. I still think about that night sometimes and wonder how things could have gone.
We became best friends instead. She helped me get over my failed attempt at rekindling my high school relationship and I, in turn, helped her when she started a long-distance relationship with a guy she knew from childhood. We met each other’s parents, our friends joked about us getting married, but apart from one drunken mistake, we remained platonic. I started to develop feelings for her, but her relationship and my fear of losing our friendship kept those feelings well in check. Then they broke up, shortly before the start of junior year. On an inebriated night a few weeks later, we passed the point of no return.
Maybe I was too eager. She was my best friend, she had just gotten out of a relationship and she needed me. I should have just been a shoulder to cry on, but I wanted more. I wanted to know that I was good enough to be loved again.
I’m still not sure what to call what we had — “dating” seems presumptuous and “hooking up” crass and inadequate. I loved her. It was a relationship built on deep and sincere friendship, which made the end that much worse. 
She had planned to go abroad in the spring, and, on a whim, I applied and was accepted to study abroad in the same country, albeit at a different university a few hundred miles away, a quick flight or train journey. 
Before we left for winter break, she told me she wanted to be single while we were abroad, that she needed time to learn how to be alone. Against the wishes of my heart, I agreed. I was going to be traveling with my family out of the country so the “breakup” at least came at a convenient time.
We kept in touch over the winter break, and my tortured heart deceived me into thinking that she wanted to stay together abroad. I constructed a beautiful fantasy of our time in Europe — weekends in Paris, Dublin, Amsterdam. I made plans to visit her one of the first weekends after we settled in and she invited me to stay with her. Shortly after I booked the train tickets, she called to say that she had changed her mind –– this wasn’t what she wanted anymore. A couple weeks later, I saw her on a trip organized by USC and overheard her in a bar telling another girl that her ex was coming to visit and that she loved him. 
I think that’s what made it hurt the most, that she chose him over me. I was nothing but a brief interlude in her real relationship — a rebound, a mistake, unworthy of being hers. It would have been easier if she had remained single, or even dated someone new, but the fact that she went back to a relationship — the troubles of which I was intimately familiar with — twisted the dagger in my heart. 
Several months later she sent me a lengthy email apologizing for how she treated me. Foolishly, I agreed to visit her again only to be rebuffed once more. Finally, after a rendezvous in Amsterdam, I broke off contact completely.
Months passed. We met once for coffee at the beginning of senior year when she told me she had gotten back together with him, again. Despite brief and awkward interactions forced by mutual friends, I avoided her for most of the semester. I still had my hope — as I’m sure every unrequited lover does — that she would realize her mistake and come back to me. Then, at the beginning of December, she texted me saying that she had broken up with her boyfriend. 
I thought I had learned my lesson. We resumed contact but I kept my distance. We went to a movie together and talked on and off over winter break, but otherwise not much had changed. At the beginning of this semester, she invited me over for lunch and said she wanted to give things another try. The next few days moved very quickly, and I thought things were going well, that my hopes were finally being realized, but after a stupid argument she got cold feet — this wasn’t what she wanted, she only wanted to “casually date.” 
We haven’t spoken much since. We agreed to try and just be friends, but we both know that probably won’t happen. Too many painful memories, too many tacit expectations. Conflicting emotions churn in my heart: anger over the rejection, guilt for my mistakes, longing for the past and loss for what could have been. I miss her. The greatest part of our relationship was also what makes it the hardest to move on from — the underlying friendship. 
I’m doing better now. My friend, an aspiring psychologist, gave me some advice that really helped — simply identify my feelings and the reason behind them. The act of stating “I’m feeling X because Y” is strangely comforting. It helps me understand and compartmentalize my emotions. I’m putting myself out there more too, but my heart’s not really in it. The hardest part of giving up on someone is letting go of the life you imagine with them. I’m not sure if I’m ready to do that yet.
