Despite a strong third-quarter performance, USC fell to itscross-town rivals UCLA 73-60 in the first round of the PAC-12 Tournament in Las Vegas Wednesday. 
Coming into the tournament as the No. 10 seed with their 5-12 conference record, the Trojans went up against the No. 7 seed Bruins with an 8-8 conference record. 
The score was close heading into halftime with USC only down 7. Then, the Trojans came out strong in the third quarter to tie things up going into the fourth. Nevertheless, UCLA proved too much for the Trojans, as they outscored USC 27-14 to end the game, leading to its victory. 
“I was really proud of the way we fought back in the third quarter when things on paper weren’t really going our way,” said Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb in a postgame press conference. “It is the start of something for us, not the end of something, even though it feels like the end right now.” 
The two standout performances from the game included graduate student forward Jordan Sanders and freshman forward Rayah Marshall who had 18 and 17 points, respectively. 
Marshall notched a double-double once again with 10 rebounds during the game — her fourth double-double in the last five games.  Marshall also performed well on the defensive end, with 2 steals and 1 block. Sanders also picked up 5 rebounds during the game.
“I grew mentally, physically stronger. Once I got the hang of things, I felt like I was able to get the rhythm of college basketball,” Marshall said about her season. “But, what I will say, what I can take in going next season, is this fire feeling that I am feeling right now … Next time around, I am going to carry this same feeling and take it out on whoever is on the other side.”
Both players received Pac-12 honors for their play this season. Marshall was voted to the All-Pac-12 Freshman Team and was an All-Defensive Honorable Mention, while Sanders was an All-Pac-12 and All-Defensive Honorable Mention.  
With this loss, it marks the likely end of the women’s basketball season as the Trojans are not projected to make March Madness. 
USC finished with a 12-16 overall record in Gottlieb’s inaugural season with the squad after serving as a Cleveland Cavaliers assistant coach the previous two years. 
“There is no blueprint for the end of the season. There is no blueprint for a loss in a one-and-done tournament situation,” Gottlieb said. “I am sad to not have another game with this group.”

A self-described “small-town kid,” Alex Peiffer never thought he would attend the University of Southern California. Growing up in Fostoria, Ohio, Peiffer recounted living in “a different world” — a railroad town far removed from the bustling campus life of University Park. 
But having lived in the Midwest his whole life, including as an undergraduate at Ohio State University, Peiffer wanted a change. After a “terrible winter” in Chicago consisting of 40 consecutive freezing days, he remembers having wondered “what it’s like in L.A.” As he applied to MBA programs, his research led him to schools along the West Coast — among them USC. 
Ryan Jach, an MBA student in the same core class as Peiffer, said that, although entrepreneurship was not top of mind for Peiffer when he began his MBA, he saw many of the early signs of Peiffer’s entrepreneurial disposition. 
“He’s always pitching things,” Jach said. Even if those “things” meant “random vacations in Europe.”
Peiffer later joined the Universitywide New Venture Seed Competition, organized by the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, where he said he began to understand the intricacies of developing ventures. 
Conversations at the Marshall Military Veterans Association, which Peiffer became the president of, led Peiffer to take a friend’s initial concept — focused on electro-diesel hybrid locomotives — to Tim Luchini, a childhood friend who worked as an engineering manager at Boeing.
Though Luchini said he wasn’t immediately receptive to Peiffer’s vision, he saw the potential of something with “more of a truck-sized form factor, but [that could] take advantage of a bunch of the efficiencies that rails offer.” 
The impetus of Intramotev, the venture borne from these initial concepts, was freight rail’s inefficiencies as a transportation system, according to the company website. In the United States, there are around 1.6 million rail cars that transport goods each day, but a large portion of these cars remain idle, waiting for a locomotive to move them, according to a Wall Street Journal report. By implementing autonomy and electrification into railcars — which Intramotev is currently working on with their TugVolt prototype — these cars can actively transport goods in a way that takes fossil fuels out of the equation.
After graduating from Marshall in 2020, Peiffer took on a role as an associate brand manager at Nestlé while working hard on the side to ensure Intramotev’s financing. By doing so, the founding team could formally devote themselves to the venture. 
Peiffer eventually succeeded in his fundraising efforts, and Intramotev launched in January 2020. According to Peiffer, the rail industry is historically optimized for large distances and even larger hauls, so there is a lack of short trains that can transport smaller hauls.
Given the insights Lucchini shared as an engineer in the aerospace industry, Peiffer said he saw technology’s ability to unlock this need.
 “The biggest, both challenge and opportunity for the rail industry is the flexibility and competing with the flexibility and reliability of trucking,” Peiffer said.
With the increased attention on supply chain challenges during the pandemic, Intramotev’s mission has only grown more pertinent, Peiffer said. But Luchini reiterated that “our thesis and our approach” hasn’t shifted.  
“The spotlight has been on supply chain and logistics in a way that probably has never been before. And that just makes it seem really timely in what we’re trying to do,” Luchini said.
Peiffer added that expanding rail travel would have many societal benefits, including lowering costs of freight, emissions and road congestion.
Throughout his entrepreneurial journey, the Trojan Family was invaluable for Peiffer. It was classmates and other USC connections that introduced Peiffer to “people that have turned out to be anchor investors.” 
More broadly, Peiffer highlighted that “there’s so many things to do and so many things to learn because you have to wear so many hats that you rely on your network to find people to help you that have already been there.”
Peiffer said his journey and success shouldn’t be unique, offering three main points of advice for aspiring student entrepreneurs: “Build and establish and leverage a network,” “utilize that as you’re trying to build a company” and “just do it.”
“The opportunity is never going to be perfect. It’s never going to be super optimal timing or conditions,” Peiffer said. “You just need to get started and things will start falling into place.”
Nowadays, work is a little bit closer to home for Peiffer, given Intramotev’s headquarters in St. Louis, Mo. The railroads he grew up around in Fostoria are the very rails he is now working to reimagine. 
But for Peiffer, the experiences he accrued and the relationships he built at USC have never been more important. “Even though a lot of people are… solo founders or have a small team of people that they rely on, it’s not the work of one or two or three people.” 
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the initial concept for hybrid locomotives came from Peiffer. The concept came from Peiffer’s friend. As well, the previous version of this article’s headline incorrectly stated that Intramotev’s railcars are electro-diesel. Intramotev’s product is battery electric and autonomous. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

Lenu is no longer a child. The girl who adorned the pages of Elena Ferrante’s first two books in the “Neapolitan quartet” and the first two seasons of HBO’s Italian-language drama “My Brilliant Friend” is now a published author and fiancé.
The show’s third season, which premiered on Monday night after a two-year wait, forwent some of its rustic luster for modern shine. But Ferrante’s melancholia beams through the screen and leaves the viewer with a beautiful and aching sense of loss. 
The first of Ferrante’s “The Neapolitan Novels” was published in 2012 and shares a name with its TV adaptation. The show, filmed in Italy, has followed the same timeline as the novels, with each season dedicated to a book. Ferrante has a writing credit on the show and the lyrical reveries of her characters translate perfectly to the screen.
In the first season, the protagonist, Lenu (Margherita Mazzucco), is a little girl living in a Neapolitan slum in the 1950s and 60s. A clever girl, Lenu tries to make sense of the despair and disarray around her. She and her best friend, Lila (​​Gaia Girace), bury themselves in the world of books to escape the violence that surrounds them. In the second season, Lenu and Lila’s lives diverge. Lenu climbs her way out of poverty, using her intelligence and educational opportunities while Lila descends into an arduous life as a teenage bride and young mother. 
In the first episode of season three, Lenu, now in her 20s, is far from the dust and grime of her childhood apartment complex. The show opens on a book reading in Milan, where she signs copies of her first novel. Also at the reading is Nino, her childhood crush and a character who weaves in and out of the narrative over the seasons like a wrecking ball, destroying everything in his path. When her fiancé appears after the reading, Lenu is sullen and ambivalent to the adoration of her future husband as she has once again become obsessed with Nino.
While Lenu has always been a reserved person, living so vividly in her head — the show is elegantly narrated through the voice of an older Lenu — her coolness becomes a little tiresome and somewhat unbelievable. She seems incapable of hiding her feelings but also unable to express them. The dispassion she shows to her family, friends and fiancé feels overwrought and misplaced. It is also in stark contrast to the show’s setting, score and script, which all ooze passion and urgency.
In a later scene in the episode, Lenu accidentally attends a student protest at a university in Milan. There she becomes intrigued by a young woman with a baby. This woman, not so subtly, reminds Lenu of Lila, who has a young son. When the young mother and Lenu end up at a house party together, Lenu comforts the mother and her crying child. She takes the child from the mother and tenderly rocks the baby to sleep.
Margherita Mazzucco, who plays Lenu in the second and third seasons, is only 18 years old. As she holds the baby, she appears uncomfortable. The proportions between her and the baby are unsettling. Similarly, Lenu’s unemotional facade would perhaps appear more natural if she were played by an older actor. As the third season reaches into Lenu’s 20s, Mazzucco will play someone almost ten years older than herself. Excellent in the second season, time will tell if Mazzucco can play this increasingly sophisticated role.
Lila, the second pillar of this series, is absent from this first episode, but the title sequence promises that she will appear at some point. Her absence further symbolizes the separate paths that she and Lenu have taken. While Lenu writes and studies — and engages in glamorous activities — Lila works relentlessly in an oppressive sausage factory. 
While the earlier seasons of the show had the tone and texture of an old video camera — incidentally, the title sequence is filmed on an old camera — this newest episode is shiny and slightly metallic. For fans of the show, this might be a little surprising and, perhaps, unwanted. Yet, the scenes set back in Naples have the same quality of homely squalor from the first two seasons. 
The show continues to endure because of Ferrante. Her words, her characters, her narrative are what make this a worthy watch. Without spoiling the story, the last seconds of the episode reveal a chilling twist in the story, breaking hearts before the screen cuts to black. The first episode promises a delightful third season to come.

A public awareness study published by researchers in the Keck School of Medicine and the Sol Price School of Public Policy found that public knowledge about a newly approved Alzheimer’s drug is low among older Americans — the demographic most at risk for the chronic disease.
The new drug, known as aducanumab, immediately sparked controversies inside and out of the FDA for its approval. Multiple members of the Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee who advocated for the drug to be rejected resigned in protest following concerns about evidence of the drug’s efficacy. With the conflict quickly unfolding in print and web media, the researchers, including Soo Borson, clinical professor of family medicine at Keck, set out to measure the effects of the media exposure on older adults.
“It’s very rare that [anything about] Alzheimer’s disease gets this kind of attention … It’s not a topic that exercises for the vast majority of people in America,” said Borson when asked about the inspiration for the research. “Many people [who specialize in dementia] were called upon to make statements, and many people wrote very impassioned papers about this — how about matching this up with a public perception?”
In the study, older adults were surveyed on a number of questions about aducanumab, including their level of knowledge about the drug and their willingness to undergo treatment. Findings showed that even though a majority of the respondents expressed concern for developing Alzheimer’s, only about 25% had some knowledge of the drug, with less than a quarter saying they wanted to receive it if they had the disease.
According to the National Library of Medicine, there are an estimated 6.2 million Americans that live with Alzheimer’s today, with 11 million family members providing more than 15 billion hours of unpaid caregiving to those diagnosed. Barring any medical breakthroughs to slow or stop the disease could cause the number of Alzheimer’s patients to grow to 13.8 million people by the year 2060. 
Co-author Mireille Jacobson, associate professor of gerontology in the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, said the overall goal of the research was not to educate the public about the new drug, rather to understand variances in awareness of the treatment.
“We’re interested in the broader issue of barriers to screening, diagnosis and treatment for Alzheimer’s,” Jacobson said. “Consumer knowledge and understanding of all these three pieces is critical.” 
The researchers used a survey resource known as the “Understanding America” panel, a Dornsife program with the Center for Economic and Social Research that surveys a set of respondents followed over time. The panel has previously obtained data on other current issues, including elections and the coronavirus pandemic. 
The lack of awareness about aducanumab among older Americans, Jacobson said, speaks to a larger issue about the difficulty of publicly communicating new changes, especially in the world of medicine. With more media varieties becoming available and popular among certain demographics, the research team noted a challenge in informing a large pool of the public at once about new developments.
“In this day and age, everyone has different kinds of media that they follow at different news sources and things get very segmented, so it’s really hard to reach a large portion of the population in one way,” Jacobson said. 
Another controversy about aducanumab’s approval lies in how the new drug treatment will be covered by Medicare. The latest proposal from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services states that the drug will only be covered for Medicare patients enrolled in qualifying clinical trials. This proposal sparked questions about the effect of the limit on insurance coverage on older Americans’ knowledge of the drug, said co-author Yi Chen, a doctoral candidate in the Price School of Public Policy.  
“With limited financial incentives, I highly doubt how actively the physicians will communicate with their patients about this drug,” Chen said.
The matter of the Medicare insurance coverage, as well as the segmented media coverage Jacobson mentioned, has inspired plans for more research among the team. 
“We’ve had a really quick email exchange about the possibility of doing a follow-up survey … when Medicare makes its final decision about coverage,” Borson said.

On an uncharacteristically brisk February Los Angeles night, scores of people flocked to a well-worn backyard on 29th Street — decorated with pop-up vendors, string lights and beaten couches — for a picturesque celebration of student art.
Friday’s Amplify x KXSC show was an effortlessly cool exhibition of student artists, featuring three quality acts — though five were slated — and nearly a dozen vendors. The second collaboration between the two organizations following last semester’s concert, the professional quality of the show didn’t scrub away its fun, homey atmosphere.
The organizations turned Surf Haus, a quaint little spot on 29th Street where the ski and surf club teams live, into a fully-fledged festival venue. Tickets were available for $5 online before the show and $8 at the door; student artists sold and showcased everything from baked goods to stick-and-poke tattoos and KXSC staffers worked a bar and T-shirt press near the back.
It’s no surprise that Amplify and KXSC, organizations dedicated to platforming excellent student musicians, found various quality artists willing to set up shop at the concert. Though they’ve hosted concerts in the past, this was the pair’s first time working with vendors.
“[KXSC has] never done anything with vendors like that, but we thought it would be cool to get people to stick around longer and make it more fun,” said Will Forker, general manager of KXSC and senior majoring in geodesign. While he and the station handled the production side of the show, Amplify booked the night’s impressive crop of artists.
The show began with Madeleine Mayi, a singer-songwriter and USC alumna whose sharp vocal control was matched only by her vulnerable lyrics and endearing asides.
“When I first learned guitar — I’m not very good at it still,” Mayi said to the crowd between songs. “I had never taken a lesson, and I had a melody line in my head that I couldn’t figure out how to play because my fingers were too small or at least I thought they were. So I learned how to play my guitar in the wrong tuning because I didn’t want to retune.”
If her guitar was out of tune, it wasn’t the least bit noticeable. As she poured out that melody in her unique tuning, the first she had ever written, the audience was gripped by her haunting voice, commanded into attention toward her skillful playing.
Mayi went on to perform a range from her still-young discography, warming the crowd up for the other acts as the sun and temperature continued to drop. The only solo act of the night, her performance served as a perfectly intimate preface to the lineup, dissolving any sense of division between audience members and performers.
The next act, L.A. indie project Rigby, delivered an invigorating performance. Singer Kellyrose Golden’s stunning voice and candid lyrics flowed over intricate, driving bass and guitar lines by bassist Ari Bone and guitarist Spencer Churchill and the bedrock rhythm laid by drummer Keegan Burkhard.
Rigby’s performance also featured the lighthearted moments that made Mayi’s so loveable. The crowd laughed along with the band as they cranked out the first few notes of AC/DC’s “Back in Black” over and over. Though this is her first non-solo gig, Golden seemed right at home with the group — and in front of the crowd, for that matter.
“Thanks for enjoying us — I tripped, so,” Golden said at the end of Rigby’s performance. “I don’t want to talk about it after this, and if anyone mentions it to me, I will cry.”
The band’s performance was a great showcase of their talents before their first-ever tour, beginning this month and playing throughout California and along the West Coast.
After a short intermission, Surf Rock group Guspy burst onto the stage with lead vocalist Jake DeGuzman’s roaring introduction. That energy sustained throughout the performance, as the band’s raucous guitar melodies went toe-to-toe with the singer’s shouted vocals.
In each winding tune, Guspy’s groove was infectious, giving their keyboardist and guitarist the perfect platform to experiment with amazing riffs and improvisations — and audience members the perfect soundtrack for jumping around.
Though the temperature had dropped — DeGuzman mentioned cold fingers making their incredible playing more difficult — the crowd kept warm by dancing through the whole set. The experience was made all the better by the flawless production from KSXC and the performers.
But, due perhaps to the sheer volume of Guspy’s performance or the considerable size of the crowd, the event was shut down by the Department of Public Safety at around 10:30, before the last acts of the night, Ayoni, Ashes to Amber or DJ Mars, could play. The explanation, Forker said, was that playing music for a crowd in general isn’t allowed. Though KXSC had seen their shows shut down in the past, Forker expected the Surf Haus location to help avoid a closure.
“[KXSC] had three events last semester, and one of them in December did get shut down,” Forker said. “Talking to friends recently, it seems events have been cracked down on more … [It was] definitely disappointing.”
Despite the abrupt ending, the show was a success for those involved and signaled the possibilities for incorporating even more artists in future shows by Amplify and KXSC. No matter what their next event showcases, you won’t want to miss it — or show up after DPS.

The return of the Trojan Farmers Market to campus has been met with cheer from students and vendors alike, along with consideration of the role such markets play in Los Angeles. The last two years with the pandemic have only exacerbated challenges, such as finding healthy options in food deserts and keeping resources circulating in local communities, which many believe markets can address.
Prosperity Market, a mobile farmers market featuring Black owned businesses, farmers and artisans, has combated those problems by hosting monthly pop-up markets around L.A. for the past year.
This past Saturday, the organization held its one year anniversary market outside the California African American Museum, minutes south of campus. The market featured more than 30 vendors — farmers, chefs, artists and small businesses — with a focus on providing a space to those usually marginalized by the market system.
“It’s difficult to get into farmers markets,” founder Carmen Dianne said. “There’s a reason that you don’t see very many Black farmers in existing markets because it’s really just a lot of hoops. Our goal was to make it easier for [vendors], to be a bridge, so they can start with us.”
Dianne and her co-founder Kara Still had no experience in food when they started the market one year ago, but they sought to create support for Black farmers and small businesses.
“Prior to this, I’m a makeup artist, [Still’s] a fashion designer, not in the food space at all,” Dianne said. “But we saw the need over quarantine. We wanted to create a way to circulate the dollar in our communities for longer. There’s a stat that [says] $1 stays in Black communities for six hours, which is a crazy statistic.”
That lack of circulation is stark in comparison to the United States’ “Black buying power” of $1.6 trillion annually, Dianne said. 
“We have this buying power, but $1 stays in our community for only six hours,” Dianne said. “There’s a huge disconnect there. What I deducted was [that] we need more Black businesses but also essential Black businesses. And that led us to food.”
The issues surrounding food in L.A., Still explained, became more obvious during the pandemic, under which Black Angelenos were disproportionately affected. In addition to worsening food deserts, 41% of Black owned businesses closed during the pandemic, Still said.
“The pandemic really shined a light on the supply chain and how food was affected,” Still said. “If you look at areas that [didn’t] already have a lot of food or grocery options, those areas are even more impacted … So you look at the economic impact of business, you look at the health and economic impact of food … And we [wanted to] create something that addresses both at the same time.”
They created Prosperity Market with the intention of purchasing a trailer to build a mobile farmers market, as well as hosting monthly pop-ups and virtual markets, seeking to spread its vendors’ goods as widely as possible.
“Being able to expand the reach of our vendors, to go into different areas that are most in need of quality food, and to help businesses grow was also part of the reason we developed the mobile business model — because everyone needs to eat, everywhere,” Still said. “Why be stationary in this pandemic world? We want to be able to go where we can be most impactful.”
The impact the market has had on the business of vendors and the various areas of L.A. they’ve served has been profound.
“[Prosperity Market] brings a lot of enterprise for Black owned businesses,” said Taylor Lindsey, founder of The Plant Plug, the first outdoor curbside nursery in L.A. “They’re bringing marketplaces to places where you wouldn’t normally see it, especially in South Central. They’re creating a hub and an incubator to where there was more of a sense of community.”
Other vendors, like Dominique Burrell, emphasized the essential work Prosperity Market does to connect communities with access to healthy food. Burrell founded Blacker the Berry Juicery, a handmade juice business, to address food apartheid and food insecurity within Black and brown communities.
“South Central was one of the big [shifts] that occurred with redlining,” Burrell said. “All the healthy food options were pushed more toward the north midcity Hollywood zone … It means a lot for me to give back to the community and say, ‘Hey, there’s other things out there, and you don’t have to travel elsewhere, we have it in your community.’”
In addition to the Market’s important common mission, many vendors expressed its welcoming atmosphere helped inspire behind their initial involvement.
“They were so transparent with their process,” Lindsey said. “Usually [markets are] just a transaction, ‘Sell your tomatoes, Get out of here, Bye,’ but I feel so connected to the whole process. It’s like a big party. We’re having a good time.”
A big party, indeed. With more than 30 vendors, a DJ blasting danceable Kaytranada and Isaiah Rashad tracks and some gorgeous L.A. weather to boot, it was a phenomenal introduction to Prosperity Market for the University Park community, who turned out en masse to enjoy the day.
“I definitely wasn’t expecting this many people,” said Adriana Gasaway, founder of ACE Naturals, a handmade organic skin and hair care boutique. “I sold out on most of my soaps, I have [only] a few more body butters left, and yeah, it was a good day.”
As the Market’s one-year anniversary, it was also a special day for Dianne and Still, who had hoped to one day host a market at CAAM.
“We have wanted to go to the CAAM for a very long time, so it felt great to be there,” Dianne said. “And to be there, during Black History Month, and on our one-year [anniversary], it was perfect … It was special to be there to celebrate Black history as we are making history with this new thing that we’re doing.”
While the pair works to help make history with its vendors, they’re also looking toward the future. At the event, they announced $12,000 of their $20,000 funding milestone to create its mobile market trailer had been raised since beginning its crowdfunding campaign on Feb. 15. They foresee opening their mobile marketplace to further expand vendors’ access to the community — and the community’s access to healthy products.
“The impact that we’re having now, it will just like multiply exponentially because we can operate daily … [Vendors] can use their time to grow food, make food, go to other markets, whatever they need to do to grow their business, we free up their time, we expose them to new [customers], we’ve expanded their reach, and we’re all growing,” Dianne said.
While they will continue to host monthly pop-ups, the pair also aim to grow their reach with these trailers, one day reaching other cities across the country.
“It’s really about impacting the local ecosystem,” Still said. “It really is built on having an impact with whatever that city’s local food, local agriculture and local businesses are … This is a way for [local] entrepreneurs and the people in each area to say, ‘This is something we want to support and help grow and expand.’”
As Prosperity Market pursues its total crowdfunding goal of $100,000, it plans to continue connecting with vendors, providing areas with healthier options and working to support Black businesses across L.A. through its monthly pop ups, a manifestation of community with which they’ve fallen in love.
“I love that people can feel the intention that goes into this because everyone who comes to the market really feels it, they get the vibe, the energy,” Dianne said. “They’re happy, all of the vendors are happy. I love that the first time you come to a market you feel that, it’s noticeable.”
Prosperity Market’s next event will be at the Hollywood Farmers Market, on Sunday, March 13 from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. The crowdfunding campaign for the Market’s mobile trailer can be found on their website.

As USC professors demand raises in salaries in their Open Letter Jan. 8 and deliberate with University administration, graduate student workers like teaching assistants, research assistants and graduate assistant lecturers should also be brought into the conversation. We often don’t see the work they do outside of classes. 
It’s not uncommon for TAs to get overshadowed by professors who don’t give them enough credit especially in cases of an authoritative power dynamic. 
The Open Letter did not exactly negate other staff or faculty from receiving pay raises, but its lack of direct mention speaks to how student workers are perceived in the hierarchy of the University. As the cost of living continues to go up, professors aren’t the only group that haven’t been paid accordingly. 
Student workers carry out similar duties as professors and assistant professors, but don’t receive nearly as much credit and money for their efforts. According to the Handbook for Teaching Assistants, Research Assistants, and Graduate Assistant Lecturers, some duties of TAs include assisting during lectures, leading discussion sections or lab meetings, holding office hours each week, grading course assignments and exams and serving as a liaison between the instructor and students. Student workers uphold all of these duties while enduring often exploitative environments just to progress towards their degrees.
While professors do deserve higher pay, especially raises that account for the cost of living, they are at a much lower risk of houselessness or food insecurity because of the massive difference in pay between TAs and professors. However, some graduate student workers, like at Columbia University, have had to rely on food stamps to make ends meet while juggling rent costs and student loan payments, according to a November New York Times article. 
Based on discussions in the r/USC Reddit forum, one of the most common complaints about USC’s graduate program is the cost of tuition. Students are burdened by loan debt beyond graduate school, so compensating them more is only a small step in recognizing their contribution to undergraduate classrooms. 
Student workers at Columbia University went as far as to strike, demanding higher pay and more insurance accommodations. USC student workers, too, should earn higher wages, full coverage of dental and health insurance and allow neutral third-party arbitration for cases of discrimination and harassment, in the case of unionization. 
These requests, especially financially, are very feasible considering USC’s wealth and the wealth of most private universities.
While student workers are not full-time employees their contributions to teaching or research activities are taxing on their progress to their degree. TAs and research assistants cannot log more than 20 hours per week on teaching and research duties. With this time restriction, universities conveniently won’t have to provide workers with  leave and holiday accommodations. That being said, student workers cannot garner any additional income beyond their set stipend or wage they receive. It’s counterintuitive for universities to encourage their student workers to focus on their studies but make their circumstances difficult. If universities, such as USC, were serious about student workers devoting the majority of their efforts to progressing towards a degree, they would pay them comfortable living wages.
Student workers should not exhaust themselves just to live comfortably and pursue their studies. Like professors, TAs, GALs and research assistants do a lot for students and research, and their efforts must be valued more. 
USC can’t even pay their professors competently, so I imagine paying student workers isn’t the most pressing matter to them. Regardless if student workers are paid more, USC should work towards creating a culture that reflects the hard work and sacrifice that these people make.
TAs don’t need to be treated exactly like professors, but they should be just as valued.

Jephtha Prempeh is one of those rare artists who doesn’t hesitate to make art on their own terms, even if that means going against the grain and making something entirely new. They could be called a “jack of all trades,” but that would be wrong. Prempeh, a senior majoring in NGOs and social change, isn’t just a student of a handful of disciplines, they are the embodiment of a spirit that is forever learning and creating.
Prempeh, who goes by the stage name J A Y K A Y P R I M E, began their journey of self discovery within the walls of Horace Mann School, a private school in the Bronx, N. Y. Prempeh, who is a child of two Ghanaian immigrants, said that the homogenous environment at the school made them more aware of how they stood out, especially because unlike most of their classmates, they were Black and came from a low-income background, they said. 
Despite these obstacles, Prempeh said that this environment challenged them to find and use their own voice for themselves and others, something which they brought to USC, yet another private school where white people make up the majority.
But at USC, Prempeh had the chance to see themselves on their own terms, part of which meant picking up a minor in music production and another in dance. For Prempeh, it was time to be in control of themself and their own narrative, but also their art. 
“I’ve never wanted to make the same type of music as somebody else, but I’ve always been like, how can I take what’s cool from this person in this genre and this like tradition and weave elements of that together?” Prempeh said. “And then how can I challenge myself to find new things that I never heard and bring that into something else?” 
Dipping their toes into different genres is important to Prempeh because of their wide perspective as a music listener. Packaging those wide interests into one product may seem difficult, but Prempeh manages to make it work to beautiful effect.
“With music production, the thing that’s really cool about it is, lyrics are very specific, right? And even with melodies like there’s a lot of expectations you can set up,” Prempeh said. “But with the actual background of this song, it’s like you can throw in so many curveballs and just completely pull the rug out from under the listener however you see fit and because you’re one person, by the time you finish the project, it’s going to still be weaved together and be coherent.” 
Part of creating that coherence is also the way in which Prempeh writes songs. Sadiba Hasan, a friend that Prempeh made during their time at Horace Mann, commented on the way Prempeh crafts stories into their songs.
“I always hear a new story in Jeph’s music, which I really, really like, and they really cover parts of their life whether it be feelings or encounters of love,” Hasan said. “But then other things as well like their experiences with their sexuality, for example, or like different encounters with people, everyday things and everyday events.” 
Hasan said that, at their core, Prempeh is a visionary who isn’t afraid to try new things. This brave pioneering spirit and vision came to a culmination last semester when they made their debut as a performing artist at Ground Zero Cafe’s First Friday event.  
“The second I got on, I was just so happy, and I felt like it was like one of those moments that is almost so creepy because you just feel like everything’s too perfect right now,” Prempeh said. “I was like, why am I not nervous anymore? It was like an out-of-body experience because, on one hand, I’m performing, but on the other hand, I’m thinking in my head, ‘Wow, this is where I was supposed to be all along.’” 
Prempeh’s love for performance stems from their desire to connect with audiences in person, instead of through the internet as most artists do nowadays. Their friend Munachimso Mbaezue, a junior majoring in musical theatre, said they have always admired the way Prempeh prepares for a performance. 
“As a performer myself, having Jephtha see me in performance spaces, the respect they have for the arts performance and for other performers is one that I highly value and respect,” Mbaezue said. “They understand that performing is not easy, and they take it and hold it to a high regard and they train accordingly.” 
Something that must be understood about Prempeh is that they not only train to be the best performer they can, but they train to be the best artist they can from music production to lyrics. What’s most enticing about Prempeh as an artist isn’t this work ethic, however, it is the way they always attempt to learn more about better communicating their message. 
“In a beautiful way, Jeph has this kind of an entitlement to knowledge,” Mbaezue said. “In the sense that they feel like, if there’s something they need, or they want to learn, they have every right to learn it.”
Perhaps that is why Prempeh holds so many titles, ranging from magazine editor to community organizer. But most abundantly clear, Prempeh is an artist in every sense of the word, and they go by the name J A Y K A Y P R I M E.
J A Y K A Y P R I M E will be performing Friday at 8 p.m. in Ground Zero Cafe’s upcoming First Friday event.

As we approach the two-year anniversary of the March 2020 nationwide coronavirus induced lockdown, it’s shocking to see how quickly so many aspects of life have shifted back to their pre-quarantine statuses, as mask mandates loosen and large social gatherings return. Yet, despite society’s overall trend back towards an in-person lifestyle, TikTok has maintained its relevance since its boom at the beginning of quarantine and remained a constant for many. 
I think I’ll always relate TikTok to the first few months of quarantine, despite downloading the app a month before everything started. When I think about TikTok, memories of whipped coffee and the Netflix docuseries “Tiger King” immediately come to mind, but it’s TikTok’s initial dance challenges that define the app and its cultural impact for myself and many others — but even more importantly, for the K-pop music industry. 
I still remember the first dance challenge I actually participated in: Zico’s “Any Song” challenge. A bright melody paired with a catchy beat and simple dance motions anyone could follow, “Any Song” arguably already followed the perfect formula to go viral on TikTok, even without intending to. Zico ensured his song’s viral success early on by creating its dance challenge and posting videos of himself, along with MAMAMOO’s Hwasa and soloist Chung Ha, doing the challenge to TikTok and establishing the #AnysongChallenge trend.
The challenge resulted in numerous other K-pop stars participating in the challenge, ranging from WINNER’s Mino to AB6IX’s Daehwi and Woong, and also catapulted “Any Song” to the top of Korea’s music charts, earning a certified all-kill just two days after its release and a perfect all-kill two days after that.
In his unique approach to marketing “Any Song” so successfully, Zico capitalized on two core aspects: following the growing global trend of TikTok dance challenges and utilizing his connections with other idols to expand his audience. It’s a strategy still implemented by many idols, with groups partnering up to film dance challenges to promote each other’s songs, such as ASTRO’s JinJin and Rocky and MAMAMOO’s MoonByul with their songs, “Restore” and “LUNATIC,” respectively.  
Perhaps even more intriguing than the songs that are purposely promoted by K-pop companies on TikTok are the songs that go viral seemingly by chance. Driven by a desire to promote their favorite artists’ music even more to non-fans, it isn’t uncommon for fans to edit short video compilations of their idols with, or make up simple choreographies for, their idols’ “B-side” tracks — or songs that aren’t performed on weekly music shows. These strategies often propel these B-sides to new levels of popularity – ENHYPEN’s “Polaroid Love” and TREASURE’s “DARARI,” despite not being promoted actively, surpassed their respective albums’ title tracks in Spotify streams following the creation of TikTok dance challenges and edit trends. 
In this way, fans are suddenly given a unique opportunity to play an integral role in the success of their idols’ activities. Prior to TikTok’s boom in relevance, in order for fans to tangibly demonstrate their loyalty and support for their idols, many spent obscene amounts of money on albums and streaming passes to boost album sales and charting positions. 
In an industry driven by capitalism, it’s interesting to see how TikTok — a free platform — has suddenly become so instrumental in how K-pop is shared, consumed and marketed. Even more so, perhaps the growing prominence of TikTok in relation to K-pop is reflective of the growing shift away from the capitalist nature of the industry itself.

“Zoom fatigue” is a phrase that we’ve heard so much over the past two years that by now, they should have created a word for fatigue related to hearing that word. 
Zoom University was an interesting time. The days went by slowly, but in the blink of an eye at the same time. It didn’t matter if it was Friday or Monday — every day felt the same. Now that we’ve been back to in-person classes for one semester and counting, the novelty is beginning to wear off and a more permanent place for Zoom in our lives seems to be opening. 
Let’s be honest. Commuting or walking to school takes up more time than it should. Attending a 50-minute class can consume about three hours of your time. If you shower and eat breakfast before class, that means you have to wake up at least one hour before the class starts — that is, if you want to be on time. Once class is over, you have to walk home or use some other type of wheeled transportation. If you use the latter or if you live very close to campus, you may have the next hour open to do whatever you want. 
But those who live further from campus or who do not own another method of transportation besides their feet can say goodbye to that next hour of time that will be spent going back home and unwinding. 
While staring at a computer screen all day was boring and constant exposure to blue light was unhealthy, Zoom is constantly proving that it’s ahead of its time. When the pandemic started, Zoom was there to make remote learning possible, and now that we’ve been back in-person, Zoom is here again to revolutionize the workplace by making our day more flexible. 
Harry Moseley, the global chief information officer for Zoom, calls this time the “era of flexibility.” Workplaces are slowly becoming the first to accept this. 
According to the 2021 Microsoft Work Trend Index, remote job listings on LinkedIn have increased five times since the beginning of the pandemic. Although this doesn’t necessarily mean that the work is more flexible, the study also found that 46% of the workforce plans to relocate because they now work remotely. It’s a sign that remote work, if not the flexibility of time, offers the flexibility to choose where one lives without having to calculate commute times. 
I’ll admit that college is an institution that works best when social interaction takes place in person. But this semester, I have found that Zoom’s existence has made my week easier by allowing me to choose when I am on campus.
As college students, we have become very familiar with pulling all-nighters. Sometimes, they happen because of our own irresponsibility or because of hectic midterm seasons, where the workload is overwhelming. 
Regardless of the reason why getting up for our 9 a.m. classes is hard, when Zoom is an option, you not only get to sleep more, but you also can spend that time doing whatever else you want.
The problem with remote learning wasn’t the fact that school was online. We have to look at the bigger picture. The problem was that social interaction with our peers was mostly occurring online instead of in person. A 2020 Harvard study found that feelings of loneliness increased during the pandemic, with 61% of young adults saying they felt “serious loneliness.” Now that school is back in person and it is relatively safe to visit family and friends, Zoom gives us the flexibility to spend more time with our loved ones. 
Zoom should be available for every class at USC because it affords us that flexibility and because, more importantly, the pandemic isn’t over. Everytime we step foot on campus, we run the risk of getting sick and spreading the disease to others in our community. 
While the pandemic still lingers, many are already thinking about life after it. In addition to the many structural changes that this country needs to make regarding racial inequalities in areas such as education, healthcare and income, the country needs to reshape the way we think about school. 
USC can be a pioneer by making Zoom a permanent part of their instruction. Not only will we have more flexibility in planning our day, but we will also make the school safer, healthier and more open to extracurricular activities. 
Zoom fatigue is a thing of the past. Zoom flexibility is happening now, and it’s time that we embrace it.

We’re currently on the brink of a sixth mass extinction. Species naturally fluctuate with the passage of time, but this extinction is different. Plants and animals across the globe are being threatened by climate change, disease, habitat degradation and competition for resources with nonnative species — all conditions exacerbated by the heavy anthropogenic footprint on our planet. While we can’t fully prevent the ebb and flow of evolution, we can certainly address the impacts of our own actions. 
As humans, we’ve established a tradition of focusing our conservation efforts on more aesthetic animals. There’s even a term for the phenomenon — “charismatic megafauna,” encompassing all the exciting “marquee species” like pandas, whales, polar bears and elephants. Qualities such as humanlike characteristics, warm-bloodedness, bright colors and even commercial viability can subconsciously influence our love for certain species and consequently, our desire to save them. 
We’ve been known to do the same thing with commercially-profitable species like bluefin tuna, honey bees, dolphins and whales. But where does this leave the world’s bats, snakes, insects, spiders, rodents and marine filter feeders? 
Scientists have long argued that donating to more appealing species creates an umbrella effect that adequately protects the rather less-charismatic species out there, but is our prioritization of aesthetics and profit to our own detriment? Focusing on flagship species is an efficient way to segment off areas of ecosystems as protected, but a blanket approach fails to adequately cover the individual needs of all flora and fauna. 
We’re in danger of restructuring the natural function of Earth’s ecosystems through human aesthetic preferences. Our conservation strategies are un-biological in nature, failing to account for the complexity of habitats and species interactions. Even if we successfully protect populations from various anthropogenic threats, failing to account for the entire food web can still cause major trophic downgrades. 
According to a study conducted by Arizona State University conservation science professor Leah R. Gerber, the amount of government funding available for species under the United States Endangered Species Act is one of the best predictors of species recovery. However, according to the study, “government spending is both insufficient and highly disproportionate among groups of species.” This phenomenon is common around the globe, and limited funds force scientists to place a monetary value on the conservation of particular species.
When it comes to funding, is a narrow focus on particular species better than no focus at all? One such approach by scientists is conservation triage. Creating a priority order of species to save may mean letting go of those that are too costly to recover. Conversely, New Zealand has been working on a Project Prioritization Protocol that assesses the urgency of species situations, how preserving them would help other taxonomic groups and offers individualized conservation plans that even include cost estimates. This strategy has even increased governmental funding, as montized estimates show what could be done with more money allotted. 
PPP has proven that the capacity to allocate funds more effectively is possible — even with minimal funding, we can still create maximum scientifically-informed impact. The EDGE of Existence conservation program offers yet another alternative to traditional financial decision-making, evaluating species with the goal of preserving distinct evolutionary branches. While EDGE must be improved — it currently only analyzes species that have been evaluated by the highly incomplete International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List — it’s proven that marketing lesser-known wildlife can actually cause an increase in funding for its conservation. 
Successfully protecting endangered species requires a combination of funding, protected areas and specialized conservation strategies. Take, for example, the New Zealand kakapo — a flightless, endemic parrot that has long existed on the brink of extinction. Conservationists generated public interest by making it the official “spokesbird” of New Zealand conservation, and it became the inspiration for the “party parrot” emoji, a staple of the Daily Trojan Slack channels. 
More importantly, scientists have employed a variety of well-researched and specific strategies in order to encourage repopulation — activity trackers, genome sequencing, artificial insemination and constant monitoring — in addition to championing traditional Indigenous ecological knowledge. The individualized approach has resulted in record-breaking breeding years and a revived public interest in the fate of the birds. 
Despite this, there are still limits to what conservation can achieve. The reversal of global biodiversity loss is counterintuitive to continued human industrialization and economic growth. Money can go a long way towards creating protected areas and rehabilitation programs for flora and fauna around the world, but we’ll soon reach a limit at which point the extinctions will far exceed our economically minded comprehension. Not to mention, in many cases, we lack the basic funding to identify the full extent of species being threatened. 
Our best bet moving forward is an ecosystem-based management approach — carefully considering costs and benefits beyond just monetary terms, and employing well-researched and multipronged conservation strategies that consider ecosystem impacts as a whole. We all want to save the koalas, but in doing so, we also need to address the well-being of other natural components of their habitat, as well as effectively manage anthropogenic interactions with the ecosystem. Despite logistical funding challenges, we must get in the habit of expanding our environmental savior complex beyond the scope of just economic and aesthetic value. Species conservation is more than a charity project: It is a crucial component of ensuring planetary health for generations to come.

I attached my set of keys onto the obligatory USC lanyard, only taking it out when I needed to go through the hallways and always made sure to place it in a special compartment of my backpack after I’d used it. Yet, what I deemed to be hypervigilance was for not as I lost my keys and would pay a $200 replacement fee. 
Much to my mother’s chagrin, there was a brief stint of time by which I was positively manifesting my keys to show up — this obviously didn’t work. I relied on fortuitous encounters with my peers to open the New North Residential College hallway doors and constantly reminded my roommate to leave our door unlocked. I didn’t think twice about my habits because I mistakenly believed that I was perfectly safe within my dorm enclave. Recent events point to the contrary. 
According to a Facebook post on the USC parent page, residential assistants warned Cale and Irani Residential College residents to be wary of strangers in the building and to report any suspicious activity. According to this parent, a male non-student managed to pass through security by walking in with a large cluster of residents. A Department of Public Safety officer followed him to the residential college where he was quickly apprehended. 
A similar incident occurred in New North where a woman non-student entered the building in pursuit of a boy she was interested in. While neither situation produced any physical harm, they highlighted the weak security measures within residential colleges. 
To help ameliorate this issue, USC must buckle down on security and have students show their ID cards individually instead of allowing clusters of students to walk in together. USC can also update the hallway entry system so students can only get into the hallway using their campus ID, as opposed to having to use an archaic key system. 
This method has been used by other universities as well. For example, within UCLA residential colleges, students use a key card to get in and out of their building and are encouraged not to use their key to swipe in other guests. Given that other schools enforce this simple security method, it is reasonable that USC has the capability to follow suit. 
It’s important to note that different residential halls have varying levels of security. From personal experience, juxtaposed with New North, both Parkside residential colleges are particularly strict when it comes to students coming in and out of the building. It is difficult to grapple with why students should be subject to different levels of security simply based on where they live. This incompatibility can easily be rectified. USC simply needs to ensure each residential college institutes the same security regulations so all students are equally safe. 
Albeit trivial, nothing seems more burdensome in the moment than having to carry a C&G acai cup while balancing your phone and simultaneously having to fish through your backpack for the hallway key. Hence, New North residents constantly rely on their contemporaries for a key to open the hallways. As a result, students generally don’t think twice about helping a peer get through the door and thereby risk allowing an outsider into their hall. If students were allowed to use their USC IDs to get in and out of the hallways, it could perhaps be easier for residents to spot non-students.
It’s important to note that residential colleges serve as students’ de facto home for the school year. As a residential live-in, I want to feel sufficiently safe in my dorm and when I walk through the hallway, but I don’t want to feel constrained by a stringent security system. I’m confident the aforementioned steps would help create that perfect equilibrium between safety and security.  
At the end of the day, it is abundantly clear USC must take some course of action to help make the residential living spaces safer for students.

USC plans to release a specific timeline about eased mask restrictions Friday or early next week, said Chief Medical Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman in a student media health briefing Wednesday. The University will also consider the effects of Spring Break in this decision due to heightened exposure risk with travels. 
USC dropped the coronavirus testing requirement for fully vaccinated and boosted students Tuesday. Individuals with approved exemptions must test every 72 hours and those with incomplete vaccination status must test every four days. Nearly 82% of students, staff and faculty are currently fully vaccinated and boosted. 
The change follows decreased positivity rates at the University and coronavirus regulation changes on the federal and local levels. Positivity rates have lowered to around 0.5%, a decline from nearly 15% at the beginning of the semester. 
“When you test people for a [virus] that’s becoming very rare, because our numbers are getting so low, you can start to get a test where the test is more likely to be a false positive than a true positive particularly in the absence of symptoms,” Van Orman said. 
The University will announce testing requirements for students following Spring Break, and will distribute antigen tests prior to travels. The option to test will remain readily available to students, with all testing locations continuing to operate at normal hours. USC will also continue providing isolation services for students who test positive for the coronavirus. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention introduced a new framework for community mitigation measures, including masking and testing. The new framework changed some definitions of levels, which previously ranged between “high,” “moderate,” “minimal” and “low” and was based on the number of new cases. The new framework reflects the number of hospitalizations, in addition to new case numbers. For USC, this means that it is likely that mandates and regulations will begin to change.
“​​It sounds like a minimal kind of thing but it actually really was a fundamental change,” Van Orman said. “We’re entering an era where we are moving from a pandemic to an endemic … We are in a situation as a community where we would have cases exponentially increase and, more importantly, the cases don’t overwhelm the healthcare system.”
L.A. County is still in the high range according to the CDC; however, Van Orman said they anticipate that L.A. County will be in the medium or low range by the end of this week. This change drives the announcement by the head of the L.A. Department of Public Health that will no longer require masks Friday. The department will continue to require masking in hospitals, nursing homes, K-12 schools and other high risk areas. 
The University’s upcoming statement will outline next steps for the school’s masking policies. 
“As people come back to the classrooms, we want to make sure everybody has time to understand what the changes are, educate people about them and make sure people are comfortable if we do change the requirements,” Van Orman said.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began Feb. 24, is the latest extension of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. At the time of publication, 874,000 Ukrainians have since fled the country and 361,000 Ukrainian military personnel, outnumbered three to one by the Russian military, continue to fight back. In Ukraine, hundreds are dead or injured as Russian missiles level major cities; in Russia, Western sanctions incited panic as Russia’s currency, the ruble, lost almost half of its value overnight. 
The Daily Trojan spoke with USC international relations and cybersecurity experts, discussing the war and its impact on Ukraine, Russia and the world at large.
Gregory Treverton, who served as chair of the National Intelligence Council under the second Obama administration, identified Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea as one of the “immediate antecedents” to the current invasion.
“The Crimea operation was fairly simple,” said Treverton, a professor of practice of international relations and spatial sciences. “Crimea had long been a part of Russia, given to [Ukraine] by [Nikita] Khrushchev … I’m told by international lawyers that if Russia had gone to the international courts, they probably could have legitimized their claim to Crimea.”
Treverton also said the “stable, continuing violence” in Luhansk and Donetsk since 2015 as part of the “backdrop” of the conflict. Both are disputed territories currently controlled by Moscow-backed separatists whom the Ukrainian government considers terrorists. Putin recognized their independence in a Feb. 21 referendum, three days before invading Ukraine.
“I was one of those who thought that major invasion didn’t make any sense for [Putin],” Treverton said. “My hypothesis was that he was trying to get international attention and create a bargaining chip for negotiations with NATO about his security concerns, but the [military] buildup was much bigger than for that [reason].”
Putin announced the invasion in a televised address Feb. 24, claiming “Ukraine has never had its own authentic statehood.” Treverton said that while Putin “may actually believe his language,” there is another reason for his decision to invade.
“I think he fears that if Ukraine were independent — tolerably democratic, tolerably successful — [and] moved towards the West, that could be a danger of a color revolution in Russia itself,” Treverton said.
Western nations moved quickly to impose harsh economic sanctions against Russia, undermining its currency and toppling its economy overnight. Germany took especially drastic action: halting construction of the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline — an $11 billion energy project which aimed to import more Russian natural gas into Germany — and sending weapons to Ukraine in a policy reversal.
“I think [Putin] was surprised. Even I was surprised,” said Treverton of the sanctions. “The [Biden] administration has done a wonderful job of keeping NATO together, building a coalition. The fact that the Germans have come so far so fast, it’s really impressive.”
One reason Putin sought to blitzkrieg Ukraine was for the ease the Kremlin had in covering up the nature of the invasion — as well as the casualties. Treverton said that, while the Kremlin is “very good at controlling the narrative inside Russia,” he does not see how it can continue as the war goes on.
“You hear these oligarchs, mostly from the safety of London or New York, saying, ‘This is the end of Russia,’” Treverton said. “You get casualties, you get body bags coming back, [you] see the economic effects; and you’re asking yourself, ‘Why are we making war on Ukraine, anyway?’ … I feel like [Putin’s] in a pretty bad corner.”
Robert English, associate professor of international relations, Slavic languages and literature and environmental studies, who served in the U.S. Department of Defense from 1982 to 1986, called the sanctions a “balancing act.”
“[Western nations are] worried about backing [Putin] into a corner … or provoking him,” English said. “At the same time, we want to defeat him. We want to help Ukrainians fight this invasion off and do so, hopefully, at lower cost … So, how do we juggle helping the Ukrainians defend themselves, without appearing to enter the war in such a way that we’re fighting Putin, and that he feels justified in using a nuclear weapon or some other kind of escalation?”
English said Putin might be provoked anyway.
“He’s not winning,” English said. “And now it’s going to be a brutal, grinding slog. But, so far, he’s committed to it.”
Nonetheless, English said he believes the economic crisis in Russia, caused by sanctions, would “weaken” Putin’s political power.
“What matters to Russians is that this wasn’t supposed to happen,” English said. “This was supposed to be lightning-quick. They did not expect to have to pay such a steep economic penalty … Together with the economic pain, the humiliation and the international isolation, I think that quickly turns people against Putin.”
In the wake of the invasion, Belarus emerged as one of Russia’s only allies. In a referendum approved Sunday, Belarus reversed its non-nuclear status and agreed to host Russian nuclear weapons on its soil. English said the allyship was “bad for Belarus.”
“Once upon a time, Belarus tried to act a little more sovereign — push back, criticize Russia on some things,” English said. “Belarus didn’t even recognize the annexation of Crimea. There were lots of things where [Belarusian President Alexander] Lukashenko tried to keep his distance. All that’s forgotten now … It only means bad: Everything bad that’s going to happen to Russia will happen to Belarus until they get rid of [Lukashenko].”
Meanwhile, a polarized Ukraine united overnight against Russia and behind its president, Volodymyr Zelensky. A Feb. 27 poll by the Ukrainian sociological group, Rating, said 91% of Ukrainians support President Zelensky. In October 2021, the number was 28.2%. 
“One thing [Zelensky] can do is speak: Give a speech, mobilize, stir your emotions. He’s playing a wartime president and he’s playing it really well,” English said. “He was on his way to being a failed president — like every preceding Ukrainian president since independence. He wasn’t able to unseat the oligarchs or tackle corruption or reform the judiciary.”
Clifford Neuman, director of the USC Center for Computer Systems Security and associate professor of computer science practice at the Viterbi School of Engineering, said there were “really two parts” to the ongoing “cyberconflict” in Ukraine: information warfare and cyberattacks.
“One of the things that we’ve seen for quite some time, even independent of the Ukraine issue, is the disinformation campaigns that the Russians are known to engage in — whether it was [around] the 2016 elections, the 2020 elections … the 2018 midterms, Brexit in the U.K., the presidential elections in France,” Neumann said. 
In February, Russian media focused its “disinformation campaigns” on Ukraine. In his televised address, Putin said he aimed  to “demilitarize and denazify Ukraine” and “protect people who for eight years now have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime.” 
“We saw the narratives put forth in terms of the portrayal of the Ukrainians by the Russians,” Neuman said. “We similarly see — from our perhaps biased side — the attempts of the Ukrainians … to refute the narratives portrayed by the Russians.”
With regards to cyberwarfare, Neuman said Ukraine has been “a sandbox for Russian cyberattacks.”
“Going back as far as 2014, we’ve seen significant cyberattacks on Ukrainian infrastructure — all of which, of course, Ukrainians and the [United States] attribute to Russia,” Neuman said.
Russia, however, operates on what Neuman called a “plausible deniability,” by deflecting blame onto independent hacker groups in “the underground criminal enterprise.”
“When you look at the Mueller report … you see that certain Russian government entities were called out,” Neuman said. “But, more often than not, what you’ve got are these quasi criminal enterprises that have some relationship with Moscow during certain times.”
The same is true of the West. Most notably, the independent “hacktivist” group Anonymous brought down Russian government websites, disrupted Russian internet service providers and leaked documents from a weapons manufacturer in Belarus. 
“We’ve certainly seen Iranian and North Korean attempts on the critical infrastructure sectors as well,” Neuman said. “Now, I think that, [with] many of the cyberbreaches that we’ve seen over the past couple of years … there’s an awful lot that comes back to Russia.”

Red alert! Red alert! It’s happening. 
In my previous column, I examined both optimistic and pessimistic outlooks on the United States Men’s National Team’s chances of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. Here’s the first line of pessimism, forecasting a repeat of 2017’s failure:
“The perfect storm is upon us. Brace for impact. It happened last time, and it’s going to happen again.”
This time around, I was really hoping things would be different, but news out of Italy Feb. 22 has me afraid that, indeed, the perfect storm is approaching. 
Star midfielder Weston McKennie will miss the final qualifying window with a broken foot. Even just typing that sentence hurt my soul. 
McKennie’s story has been complex throughout the qualifying, caught up in off-the-field drama, but one truth has risen above all else: He’s an absolute baller. 
The U.S. simply can’t replace McKennie. They don’t have another midfielder with the same balance of agility, strength and instincts to command the midfield in hectic CONCACAF play. Aside from his physical attributes, he’s an elite dribbler with above average tackling and passing skills. Oh, he also scored against Mexico, which is always a huge plus. He’s a step above everyone else on the field, and he was in some of the best form of his career up until his injury. 
It doesn’t take a tactical genius to recognize McKennie’s impact on the team’s gameplan, but there’s additional context that makes this loss so damning. The team’s other stars haven’t exactly been at their best as of late. 
As both a Chelsea FC fan and USMNT fan, I am the first person to defend winger Christian Pulisic in just about everything except his griddying abilities. That being said, his form with the national team in 2022 hasn’t blown anyone away. In fact, he got benched against Honduras, and it wasn’t because of another injury. He really, and it pains me to say this, sucked against Canada. He couldn’t find any rhythm, losing the ball a plethora of times in attacking transitions and flailing on set piece opportunities. 
Of course, I must point out he scored off the bench in the Honduras game — albeit on a fairly comfortable close-range look at goal. 
Part of McKennie’s importance to the team at this point is that the stars around him just aren’t on the same level as him right now. With him out, it’s imperative that Pulisic and Co. pick up their form again. 
Losing McKennie leaves Manager Gregg Berhalter with a huge hole in the midfield, but I think I know a guy who could help.
That guy’s name is Luca de la Torre. 
LDLT, as members of USMNT Twitter often abbreviate, has only played five games entirely for the U.S. His most recent World Cup Qualifying games came against Honduras, where he truly got to showcase his skills. 
Watching de la Torre is a breath of fresh air. The creativity is the biggest selling point with LDLT. For far too long, the U.S. has had issues with creating attacking chances, and it’s been the result of midfielders who are unwilling to take risks. De la Torre is a refreshing break from the rigidity of past USMNT options. You can see it in the way he turns with the ball and moves up field, showcasing his agility and creativity moving forward. He’s always got his head up, and he has the IQ and vision to pick out passes and make incisive runs.
But you may be asking why de la Torre hasn’t gotten many chances given his talent. Good question. Berhalther, for one reason or another, excluded de la Torre from the first team conversation for most of World Cup Qualifying until the match against Honduras. He played a full 90 minutes and looked so bright, even in the frigid cold conditions. A man who was outcast from the starting team took advantage of his limited chances and proved to everyone that he can be a viable box-to-box midfielder in the first team. 
Do I think de la Torre can do everything McKennie can do? Of course not. But I do think he brings attributes that, frankly, no other available midfielder in the player pool brings at the moment. He’s got a great story, and he’s got my vote to slot into the first team. 
Replicating McKennie will be no small feat. It’s on Berhalter to pick the right player, but it’s also on the other players to kick it up a notch when it matters most. To be honest, I’m still scared to death of going into the final three games without him. If his replacement doesn’t do the job, the U.S. will struggle to pick up points and may be doomed to repeat its past failure. So here it is, I’m officially hitting the panic button just three weeks before the U.S. takes on Mexico. What else would you expect from me?

As the NBA season hits the home stretch and enters March, teams are fighting for better seeding positions with the postseason around the corner. Many former Trojans around the league prove valuable as most teams gauge their best possible lineups and rotations as they head into the postseason.  
Guard DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
The Chicago Bulls are only two games back from the Miami Heat for first place in the Eastern Conference and DeMar DeRozan this season is a huge reason for the team’s success. The five-time All-Star had a historic month that saw him average a career high 34.2 points per game on 55.3% shooting from the field along with the Eastern conference player of the month award. 
In a season filled with many ridiculously tough clutch shots by DeRozan, the latest came in the Bulls’ victory against the Atlanta Hawks last Thursday. With 20 seconds remaining and the Bulls down by one, DeRozan hit an and -one fadeaway over two defenders to put his team up and eventually win the game. He ended the game with 37 points on 71.4% shooting from the field. 
DeRozan’s recent play has catapulted him from dark-horse MVP candidate to firmly in the mix  with Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid. Due to injuries to both Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso, the Bulls will need their All-Star guard to continue his torrid pace as they look to seal home court advantage for the playoffs. 
Guard De’Anthony Melton, Memphis Grizzlies
The Memphis Grizzlies have continued to coast since the New Year with a 20-6 record, and guard De’Anthony Melton continues to be a valuable rotation piece off the bench for them with his defensive contributions along with some scoring. The versatile guard enjoyed a productive February, averaging 11.5 points, 2.5 assists and 1.6 steals per game on 43.8% shooting from the 3-point line. 
Despite playing limited minutes off the bench, Melton averages 1.6 steals per game on the season which is tied with All-Star Utah Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell for seventh-most in the league.  
In a season where the Western Conference seems wide open due to the injuries sustained by top contenders, Melton’s play off the bench will be crucial in unlocking the Grizzlies’ potential as they hope to win their first NBA title in team history. 
Forward Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers 
The Cleveland Cavaliers have recently hit a skid after temporarily losing major rotation pieces in guards Darius Garland, Caris LeVvert and Rajon Rondo due to injury over the last few weeks. However, Mobley continues to shine on both ends of the floor as he looks to help lead his team to their first playoff berth since 2018. 
Mobley showed off his clutch gene in the Cavaliers’ most recent win against the Wizards on Saturday when he was fouled with five seconds to go with his team up only 4. Mobley calmly knocked down the 2 free throws to seal the game, finishing with 14 points, 11 rebounds and 2 blocks. 
As consistent as Mobley has played on both ends of the floor this season, the rookie sensation might be asked to hit a new gear during the final stretch as his team looks to avoid the play-in tournament. 
Power Forward Onyeka Okongwu, Atlanta Hawks
The Atlanta Hawks ended February on a strong note, winning three of their last four games. After making his season debut in mid-December, Onyeka Okongwu has become a staple in the Hawks rotation. The 21-year-old averages 8.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game on the season. 
His interior defense has proved a welcomed sight for the Hawks, especially after starting center Clint Capela went down with an injury and missed a few games earlier this season. Okongwu has quietly posted efficient offensive numbers as well. His true shooting percentage currently sits at 75.7%, which would lead the league if he qualified.

Beach volleyball will compete in the 2022 Battle for LA Invitational this weekend at Maples Beach in Westwood and Merle Norman Stadium. The two day event begins March 5, and the Trojans will play a total of four games over the weekend. 
Last week, the reigning national champions opened their season against then ranked No. 15 Long Beach State. USC came out the gates strong, sweeping the Beach 5-0. The Trojans dropped just two sets in last Thursday’s dual.
“We know we have a special team, and that was a good test,” Head Coach Dain Blanton said after practice Tuesday. “We’re just trying to get better, trying to improve, trying to reach our potential.”
Among No. 1 ranked USC,  other teams competing in the invitational are No. 2 UCLA, No. 7 Stanford, No. 8 Cal Poly, No. 9 Grand Canyon and No. 154 Long Beach State. 
The Trojans will face UCLA at 10 a.m., their first match of the invitational Saturday. The Bruins are 5-0 to start the season, coming off an undefeated championship run at the Heineken Duke Kahanamoku Beach Classic at Queen’s Beach. USC faced UCLA on Gulf Shores Beach last May, where the Trojans took home the National Championship.
“We know they’re a really, really solid team,” sophomore Megan Kraft said after practice Tuesday. “Anything can happen, but we know their style of play and hopefully can practice it this week.”
Following the opening match in Westwood, the Trojans will head back to USC for the remainder of the weekend. Their second match Saturday will take place at 3 p.m. against Grand Canyon University. 
The Antelopes started the season with a sweep, defeating Boise State, No. 12 Arizona and Arizona State. Last year, the Trojans only played GCU once, sweeping 5-0 in San Luis Obispo, Calif. April 17. 
Hailey Harward, a graduate student who is paired on court one with senior Tina Graudina, said she believes her team is in a great spot looking ahead to this weekend.
“We’re ready,” Harward said. “I’m really excited for the test. At the end of the day, the results take care of themselves.”
Following the opening day double-header, the Trojans turn to Sunday where they play back-to-back games against Stanford and Long Beach State. 
Stanford, like UCLA, also competed in Hawaii to open their season. They split their first four games of the season, earning wins over No. 10 Hawaii and Saint Mary’s. Their two losses came from UCLA and Hawaii, 2-3, in a rematch in the semifinals. The Trojans play the Cardinal at noon on Sunday.
To wrap up the invitational, USC faces Long Beach State in a rematch from last week’s contest. The Beach are now 1-3 on the season after last Thursday’s contest against USC, splitting matches with Irvine Valley College and No. 11 Cal on Saturday. Following a 5-0 sweep of Irvine Valley, Long Beach State fell short in its final game against the Golden Bears, losing 2-3. Long Beach State beat Stetson but lost to Loyola Marymount on Tuesday.
According to Blanton, the Trojans will treat every match and every duel the same. He emphasized that the team will focus on one match at a time and will learn from each match over the course of the weekend.
“I want the girls to play to the best of their ability,” Blanton said. “If they play to the best of their ability, I think we can beat any team. That’s just what we believe. That’s what we train for. That’s what we expect. But, the key is not focusing on the beating of that team. The key is focusing on maximizing our potential.”
With four ranked opponents scheduled this weekend for the Trojans, the remaining champs look to improve on their 1-0 start. USC begins play Saturday, and the invitational concludes Sunday.
