At times it was flashy, as when junior driver Tobias Preuss threw a cross-pool, pinpoint pass to junior driver Forest Monroe, whose subsequent lob shot grazed off the cross bar before settling nicely into the back of the net. In other instances, the Trojans used sheer grit to overpower the Tigers, as when sophomore driver Nikola Vavic netted two goals while getting battered in front of the cage in the third quarter.
Whatever the means, it all amounted to a 13-4 victory for No. 1 USC (7-0) over No. 14 Princeton (10-2).
“We started the game well, and it’s great preparation for the SoCal Tournament,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “[Junior two-meter] Brian Boswell had a good game with three goals, and most of the goals came from two meters.”
After bursting out to a 6-1 lead in the first period, the Trojans managed to rotate more players through their lineup than usual, as eight players wound up on the score sheet. Leading the charge with multi-goal efforts were Boswell (two goals), Nikola Vavic (two goals), senior driver Peter Kurzeka (two goals) and redshirt sophomore driver Stephen Siri (two goals).
One of the main stories on the young season continues to be the emergence of Boswell, who has been a revelation at the two-meter position after an inconsistent 2010 season. Teaming with sophomore two-meter Jeremy Davie, together they form, arguably, the most formidable one-two punch in the NCAA, according to the coaching staff.
“[Boswell’s] definitely played way better this year than last year,” Jovan Vavic said. “He has been starting for us and has been very dominant in two meters. He knows that he can be really dominant, and it’s great that we can put him together with [sophomore two-meter] Jeremy Davie to really dominate teams inside.”
Throughout the match, the Tigers struggled to establish any offense near the Trojans’ cage, as most of their shots came from the perimeter. Of the four goals the Tigers scored, two came on Trojan exclusion penalties and a third on a point-blank penalty shot. Jovan Vavic has maintained the Trojans’ defensive objective every game is to limit their opponents to four goals or less, because it is unrealistic that the Trojans will be able to post double-digit offensive outbursts every game.
Though senior goalie Joel Dennerley played a prototypically strong game, registering four saves in the first half, redshirt freshman goalie Ely Bonilla came on to relieve him in the second half and exhibited why coach Vavic is optimistic about the Trojans’ future in goal once Dennerley graduates after this year.
“Bonilla is a great goalie,” Vavic said. “He has a very bright future with us — big arms, big shoulders. With some experience, he’s going to be one of the best goalies in the nation.”
With this tune-up match now in the books, the Trojans take aim to win the SoCal tournament for the ninth consecutive year, beginning with a first round match against Pomona Pitzer on Saturday morning in Long Beach, Calif.
“There’s no pressure [trying to win it again],” Boswell said. “It’s a huge tournament to win because all of the best teams are there. We’re all fired up for it.”

It would be a stretch to call last season’s performance by the USC women’s tennis team a disappointment.  The Women of Troy finished the season ranked No. 19 in the final Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings and had several players perform well enough to advance deep into the postseason.

But given the recent history of success the team has experienced under USC coach Richard Gallien, it’s no surprise that this year’s squad is looking for more.
“To stay in the top 20 in the country was certainly not our goal, but considering how few people we had ready [last season], I think we did quite well,” said Gallien, now in his 17th season with the Women of Troy.
Prior to the 2009-2010 season, USC had finished ranked no worse than No. 11 in the nation this century. The 2009-2010 season’s final rankings saw the team at No. 20, followed by last season’s finish at No. 19.
Last year’s squad was hampered by mid-season injuries to key players, and the lack of depth affected the team’s performance.  This year the Women of Troy face another huge obstacle before the season has even started in replacing senior Maria Sanchez, who graduated last spring after finishing the season No. 3 in the nation.
But the Women of Troy have plenty of returners to make up for Sanchez’s departure, including junior Danielle Lao, who finished last season ranked No. 23 in the ITA rankings and was named second team All-Pac 10.
Lao believes the team is in a good position to move forward without Sanchez.
“You can’t replace a player like Maria Sanchez,” Lao said.  “But we’ve got a lot of strong freshmen coming in who are eager and hungry, so we’re looking forward to a good season.”
That group of freshmen, ranked as the second best recruiting class in the country according to TennisRecruiting.com, consists of Gabrielle, DeSimone, Giuliana Olmos, Sabrina Santamaria and Zoe Scandalis.
Gallien expressed his excitement about this group of new players.
“Although we lost Maria [Sanchez], we also gain one of the top recruiting classes in the country and I expect all four [freshmen] to play and contribute,” Gallien said.
Though this new batch of freshmen will be relied on this season, a former highly touted recruit is also expected to be a top contributor:  sophomore Kaitlyn Christian.
In her first season playing Division I tennis, Christian teamed with the aforementioned Sanchez to form one of the top doubles teams in the country. The pair advanced to the semifinals of the NCAA doubles championships, the farthest any USC women’s doubles team has ever been. This year, however, Christian is looking to top that mark.
“The big goal would be to win the Pac-12 and NCAA championship,” Christian said. “But right now we’re just focused on working hard.”
Christian credits Sanchez as a key contributor to her own personal success.  She looks to experience some of that same success the two experienced last year with a new partner this season.
“Maria taught me a lot,” Christian said.  “She’s probably one of the best players I’ve ever played with, so hopefully I can carry some of that success into this year.”
Christian is listed at No. 60 in the preseason ITA rankings of individual players after finishing last season at No. 90. Lao currently sits at No. 16.
Teamed with other returners, such as Valeria Pulido and Allison Ramos, Gallien is looking to return to past success.
“With the players we have coming in and the returners, I really do think we should be back in the top 10 and make a solid run at a championship.”
The Women of Troy open the season this weekend at the Nike Invitational at California.

By most standards, the Women of Troy are surging.
Following wins over the nation’s top two teams last weekend in No. 1 California and No. 2 Stanford, the No. 5 USC women’s volleyball team has won four consecutive games, three over top-10 teams, as it heads to the Rockies to face Colorado in Boulder, Colo., on Friday before squaring off with Utah in Salt Lake City on Saturday.
Stepping up · Sophomore outside hitter Sara Shaw, who has 57 kills this year, has given USC another offensive threat outside of Alex Jupiter. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
But to keep its momentum going, USC (9-3, 4-1) will be forced to take down a Colorado team seeking its first conference win this season. The Buffaloes have not won a set since Sept. 11 during a nonconference matchup with St. John’s, which also marks their last match victory.
Despite its early season troubles, Colorado remains dangerous because of junior outside hitter Kerra Schroeder. Schroeder, a San Diego native, leads the Buffaloes with 192 kills, good for an average of four kills per set, which ranks seventh in the conference.
USC has a strong, but brief history against Colorado, as they lead the all-time series 3-0 with their last meeting in 1997.
After their bout with the Buffaloes on Friday, Mick Haley’s group heads to face Utah (6-8, 1-4) in Salt Lake City on Saturday.
With the Utes in the midst of its first Pac-12 homestand, Utah will be on the prowl for its second conference victory. Led by veteran coach Beth Launiere, who has posted a 425-438 record in her 22 seasons at Utah, the Utes will play the underdog role as they look to topple USC.
Though Utah doesn’t have the same kind of experience USC does — it starts two sophomores and two freshmen — the team can only get better with more playing time.
“Utah’s got good size, and while their youth makes them disorganized, I know Beth [Launiere] will have them ready,” Haley said. “They’re young, big, and they make mistakes, but the team is getting better and we have to be ready for them, especially with them at home.”
Sophomore outside hitter Morgan Odale leads the team with 146 kills on the year, but is followed closely by highly touted freshman Chelsey Schofield, who has 140. Odale plays alongside her sister, junior setter McKenzie Odale, making the duo the third pair of sisters to play under Launiere.
In the middle, sophomore Erin Redd leads the Utes with just under a block and half per set (1.49 blocks per set) to go along with her 135 kills this year. Unlike previous teams the Women of Troy have faced, Utah boasts three threats on offense and it will take a total team effort to thwart the young Utes squad.
For USC, the emergence of sophomore hitters Sara Shaw and Katie Fuller have eased the pressure on senior Alex Jupiter and revitalized the offense. During the last few matches, Jupiter has been able to flourish on the outside as the opposition’s attention isn’t solely focused on her.
With the eminent return of sophomore middle hitter Alexis Olgard, senior Lauren Williams will see her success on offense continue, as the All-American ranks fifth in the country in hitting percentage atw .418.
“Olgard will go on the trip with us, but she is not ready to play yet,” Haley said about his embattled middle blocker. “We had her in practice, huffing and puffing, but she’ll continue to get her legs back and she’ll be ready to play within the next two or three weeks, giving us another weapon to throw out on offense.”
Senior setter Kendall Bateman was named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week after combining for 83 assists against California and Stanford last weekend.
“Everybody wants a senior setter and having one always gives you a chance to win the national championship,” Haley said. “Kendall, over the last two years, has been a top setter, you have to have some hitters, but she knows when to step up and make it happen when it counts.”

Ali Khosroshahin has been the USC women’s soccer coach since 2007. Already, they have dropped seven games this year, the most in Khosroshahin’s tenure and the most since they lost nine games in 2004.
Leadership · Senior midfielder Samantha Johnson, who has recorded one goal and one assist this year, looks to help snap USC’s losing streak. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan
This weekend the Women of Troy (3-7, 0-1) face what could already be described as must-wins. USC hosts No. 19 Oregon State today and Oregon on Sunday. USC is 0-5 at McAlister Field this year, and the No. 19 Beavers (7-2-1, 1-0) will be the fourth ranked opponent the Women of Troy have faced.
As has been the case all season, no matter the opponent, no matter the venue, Khosroshahin is focused exclusively on his team — and with good reason.
“There’s a lot of talent in that group,” Khosroshahin said. “We have a lot of talent. Maybe if I didn’t think we had as much talent as our opponents I’d be more worried about them. But we can play with anyone and we’ve showed it.”
Indeed, USC’s seven losses have been by a combined eight goals. USC’s most lopsided loss has been 3-1 to San Diego in the second game of the year. Of particular note, they have lost 2-1 to No. 23 Portland, 2-1 in overtime to then-No. 23 Texas and 1-0 to then-No. 4 Oklahoma State.
“We’re a few bounces away from being 9-1,” Khosroshahin said. “I mean that Oklahoma State game says it all. We outplayed them. We outplayed the No. 2 team in the country [the Cowgirls have climbed to No. 2 in the rankings this week]. We just had one let down, they got one lucky bounce and that was it.”
Last week against Washington State the Women of Troy nearly took a 2-0 lead when senior midfielder Carly Butcher rocketed a shot from the top of the penalty box that drilled the crossbar and bounced straight down. With the score still 1-0, the Cougars attempted a center pass that was poorly struck, but found its way through the mass of bodies in the penalty box, hit the post and bounced in.
“We rip one off the bar and it comes out, and they just barely kiss one off the post and it bounces in,” Khosroshahin said. “We need some bounces.”
But Khosroshahin is not making excuses.
“We know what our problem is,” Khosroshahin said. “We can’t keep letting our guard down defensively. That’s the last place on the field we can make a mistake.”
Defensively, the Women of Troy will have their hands full against Oregon State.
The Beavers boast a balanced attack that features five players who have scored two or more goals this season.
Junior forward Chelsea Buckland and sophomore forward Jenna Richardson lead the team in scoring with six and three goals, respectively.
The Beavers’ defense is no slouch, either. Patrolling the net for Oregon State is senior goalkeeper Colleen Boyd. She recorded 14 shutouts last season. This year she has registered four shutouts and allowed just five goals in her eight appearances.
To change things up a bit for this weekend’s play, Khosroshahin appointed senior forward Samantha Johnson and sophomore defender Autumn Altamirano as additional captains.
Altamirano and Johnson will wear the captain’s bands for the first time against the Beavers Friday at 3 p.m.
SC needs a win today!  Let’s so SC!  Congrats to Samantha and Autumn.

I remember 2004 and 2005 just as much as the next person. It was a time defined by wardrobe malfunctions, Shaq and Kobe’s split, a search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and, yes, USC’s dominance on the football field.
Sure, who doesn’t like a national championship-caliber team now and again, but sometimes you just have to face the facts. This is 2011, not 2005. At some point you simply have to move on from what was and focus on what is, because time passes by too quickly to revel in the past.
This message is still unfortunately lost upon the majority of media members and fans who follow USC football through rose-colored glasses. These days, nostalgic trips down memory lane aren’t few and far between for some, but instead daily doses of delusion.
It simply needs to stop.
The present isn’t as bright at the Coliseum as it was six years ago, and if that obvious sentiment is lost on anybody, just check the attendance numbers. But it does nobody any good to continue the comparisons back to a time where the grass was a little bit greener.
At some point, the only way to accept reality is to appreciate it for what it is.
If this year’s version of the Trojans is the roast beef to the 2005’s filet mignon, sign me up for a few extra slices. There might not be a title waiting on the other side of the 12-game schedule, but it’s hard not to root for these guys.
If you subscribe to the school of thought that defines these players solely as athletes, maybe this won’t make much sense. Even with the current win-loss total, give me this group 10 times out of 10 over the 2004 and 2005 teams.
What they might lack in firepower, pro-potential and genuine swagger, they make up for in the character department.
The 2004 and 2005 teams were led by a quarterback who was more interested in celebrity status and self-image than in buying into the team concept. He could perform on Saturdays, sure, but outside of rare athletic gifts, how great a spokesman was he for the athletic program?
Give me the current No. 7, not only behind center but as the face of the program. Instead of carousing the club scene in Hollywood during his off-season, Matt Barkley was volunteering his time in Nigeria. So while his touchdown to interception ratio might not pack a stadium like Matt Leinart, let’s face it: He’s a better poster child for a university that preaches well-roundedness and community activism.
During the so-called “golden years” of USC football, running back Reggie Bush electrified crowds with his acrobatic leaping ability and flair for the dramatic. Along the way, he would win a Heisman Trophy and sell a bunch of jerseys and video games, but he would also plant the seeds for the sanction-imposed paradise we now live in.
Sure 2011’s group is a motley crew of characters compared to Bush, Leinart and company, simply trying to get the program on the map again rather than planning for a New York City ceremony or bowl game.
But how many football players do you know that split time between the practice field and the stage every week, as freshman running back Amir Carlisle, a theatre major with a 4.0 GPA in high school does?
How many give up their summer break to teach kids how to play football in American Samoa, as starting junior center Khaled Holmes did in 2011?
Or who are so passionate in prayer and faith that they attempt to start an on-campus ministry group as junior wide receiver Brice Butler has done this semester?
Up and down the roster — from junior running back Curtis McNeal to sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey to senior tight end Rhett Ellison — lies story upon story about current players selflessly helping the community, pursuing interests outside of football or taking part in educational endeavors that can’t be ranked by the BCS or shown on ESPN’s Top 10 plays.
This is by no means a slap in the face to the Pete Carroll years we all know and love, but times have changed, and in some ways for the better. The word “student-athlete” as it pertains to the football program might mean more now than ever before.
Though fans might not like that Athletic Director Pat Haden has diligently worked to emphasize the initial part of the label more so than the latter, sometimes sacrificing a few wins for the betterment of the school is necessary.
Celebrity has been replaced by stability around these parts, and it’s bound to shift even more in the coming years. For those who continue to struggle with the notion of this program not being what it once was on the field, take solace in knowing that off the field, successful strides are being made everyday.
It might not be 2005, but from where I’m sitting, 2011 ain’t so bad.
 
“For The Love Of The Game” runs every other Friday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Dave at dulberg@usc.edu.
I commend your championing of this 2011 team, they deserve every bit of praise and gratitude.  
But I must take issue with maligning a former Trojan great, and that historic team he led, to make your point.    Try asking the parents of Ryan Davidson, the Make A Wish Foundation, or the disadvantaged kids that play in the Urban Youth Football League, their opinion of  Mr. Hollywood and the foundation he established (as promised while at USC) with his first NFL check.  
It must also be mentioned that a great number of the players on that 2004-2005 team signed their LOI to a program that had faded into irrelevance.  Khaled Holmes’ brother was one of those players,  so was Matt Kalil’s brother Ryan.  
The kids on this 2011 team came to a program that had returned to national prominence, and Thank God for them, but their predecessors rebuilt the dynasty.  Give each group their due without taking shots at the other.

A young Trojans squad finds itself in unfamiliar territory.
Returning home from a disappointing loss on the road against Arizona State, how will USC respond?
Despite what happened in Tempe, Ariz., last Saturday, the coaching staff feels the team is ready to put the past behind it.
“We had a great week of practice,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “They were a focused group. The best way to forget about a loss is put it away. The best way to put it away is to play really well and win.”
Tough task · Sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey, who has 15 tackles this season, will be asked to slow down Arizona wide receiver Juron Criner Saturday at the Coliseum. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
USC (3-1, 1-1) will have to play well against an Arizona squad that returns its top two offensive weapons in senior quarterback Nick Foles and senior wide receiver Juron Criner. Though Arizona’s (1-3, 0-2) record might be deceiving, they have already faced three top-10 opponents in then-No. 9 Oklahoma State, then-No. 6 Stanford and No. 10 Oregon.
Foles and Criner lead an Arizona attack that ranks 40th in total offense, which averages almost 435 yards per contest. Foles already ranks No. 3 in Wildcats history with 7,124 passing yards and No. 2 with 49 career-passing touchdowns. Last week in the loss against Oregon, Foles threw for 398 yards and three touchdowns.
“He’s like a Peyton Manning type of guy,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “You can tell how he carries the team and how he organizes the players. He and [Juron] Criner are the key guys to their offense.”
Criner has 21 receptions for 295 yards and two touchdowns this year. He also ranks in the top six in Arizona history in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns.
Slowing down Foles and Criner, however, won’t be easy. Though the USC defense has shown improvement through four games this season, the coaching staff believes it can be much better, especially the secondary.
“At times, [they’ve] played well,” Kiffin said. “We haven’t created enough explosive plays, but at the same time, we have limited explosive plays, so we’ve improved there. We just need to tackle better and make some significant plays on the ball.”
Though backed by a potent offense that ranks in the top-third of the nation, Arizona’s defense is in the bottom-10. The Wildcats rank No. 112 in total defense and No. 106 in scoring defense, allowing teams 484 yards of offense and 35 points per contest. The statistics might present one story, but the coaching staff believes Arizona’s defense is not as bad on paper.
“They have played three of the best offenses in the country,” Kiffin said. “Everybody talks about whether they’re ranked on defense, [but] those [teams they played] are some of the best offenses in the country, so they’re going to be ready to play.”
USC’s offense will take what it can get. The Trojans struggled on third-down conversions at Arizona State finishing 1-of-9 as part of a season-long struggle to score. Arizona’s defense, however, has allowed opponents to score touchdowns on 73 percent of its red-zone drives (16-of-22).
More than the Wildcats’ inability to stop opponents in the red zone is their failure to control the run game. Opponents have rushed for 230 yards per contest and the Trojans can take advantage, especially with Arizona starting five interior linemen who are either freshmen or sophomores. In last season’s 24-21 victory in Tucson, senior running back Marc Tyler rushed for 160 yards and one touchdown. This season Tyler leads all USC running backs with 303 yards and two touchdowns.
“Marc has been great for us, picking up yards and first downs,” sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods said. “With him doing well, it’ll open up the passing game and play action for us.”
The Trojans have yet to find a No. 2 receiver to ease the pressure off Woods. Kiffin hopes freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee can fill that void, especially after his performance through four games this season.
“I know it’s early to say, but I think he is going to be one of the best receivers ever to play at this school,” Kiffin said. “We got to do a better job of getting him the ball. He continues to make plays almost every opportunity we give him.”
With USC heading into a bye week after this weekend’s matchup,  the upperclassman understand the importance of this game  and hope the underclassmen will be ready and focused on how to deal with adversity this early in the season, too.
“The older you get, the more you learn how to deal with losses,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “As tough as they are, it’s even worse to lose back-to-back. So we [have to] make sure to win a big game in the Coliseum [going] into the bye week.”

The event, sponsored by USC’s Interfraternity Council, USC’s Panhellenic Council and Chewse.com, a catering company formerly known as Dish Dash LA, donated 10 percent of proceeds to Troy Camp. The IFC and PHC each sponsored five different food trucks to compete for a special trophy.
Last year’s inaugural Food Truck Wars was a highly successful event that pitted the east side of the Row against the west, while this year’s event focused more on the Greek community as a whole. The competition aspect, however, was not completely lost this year; even the owners of the trucks were swept up in the idea of fraternities vs. sororities.
“Everyone gets naturally competitive in an event like this,” said Bill Kelly, found of Smokin’ Willie’s BBQ. “It’s a great idea, and we’re proud to be a part of it.”

Smokin’ Willie’s BBQ truck, sponsored by the IFC, was a major draw for many students. Though the truck has only been operating for a year and a half, Smokin’ Willie’s is a well-established barbecue sauce brand.
The truck served up thick hoagie rolls layered with meat choices of pulled pork, spicy or classic chicken, and meatball. It also had less-traditional items such as BBQ tacos and sliders, served with the quintessential BBQ side dishes of baked beans, cole slaw or potato salad. A pulled chicken sandwich with coleslaw and a soda cost $8.50.
Other IFC-sponsored trucks included Slammin’ Sliders, Uncle Lau’s Island BBQ, Longboard’s Ice Cream and Macho Nacho. Longboard’s Ice Cream was particularly popular, boasting hand-dipped ice cream bars and frozen bananas with more than a dozen topping choices, including Pop Rocks and Fruity Pebbles.
The PHC provided some quality competition with its food truck picks. The Buttermilk Truck took up its usual position in front of Gamma Phi Beta, while Cheer Burger, George’s Greek Gyro Truck, Lake Street Creamery and Sweet E’s parked outside of Alpha Chi Omega and Delta Tau Delta.

Many were willing to hand out samples on request, and George’s Greek Gyro Truck gained fans with large platters of pita and beef gyro, which the food truck passed out to the waiting crowds.
Sweet E’s, which specializes in miniature baked goods, boasted a drool-worthy window display of sweet treats. The truck showcased tiny cupcakes in various flavors, such as vanilla chocolate-chip cookie dough, blue velvet, cookies and cream and Mexican chocolate churro.
In addition, the bakery sold chocolate-dipped pretzels, rice crispies and Oreos. The truck has been mentioned in Eater LA, OK Magazine and the Los Angeles Times. Each cupcake was $1.50, while other treats were slightly higher in price.
The 10 food trucks were very popular throughout the evening, some more than others. The success of the event means that Troy Camp’s hopes for enough funds to send a group of children to Disneyland this month might be realized.
Stay tuned for updates and the final results of this year’s Food Truck Wars.

Six weeks into the semester, professors appreciate the installment of technology in 31 classrooms over this summer, but don’t always take advantage of it.
Some faculty members are unaware of the new technology available in classrooms across campus.
Though the university provides workshops showcasing the new technology for faculty, some like William Thalmann, a professor of comparative literature, have not found time to attend.
“I don’t know what is different now than five years ago,” Thalmann said. “I only have so much time. I know what works for my classes so I must set priorities.”
Susan Metros, associate chief information officer for technology-enhanced learning and associate vice provost for ITS, said her staff provides assistance to professors who need help adjusting to the new technologies.
“We do a good job of helping professors to better understand the technology without forcing new devices down their throats,” Metros said.
On Jan. 25 the university began offering subscription access for professors and students to Lynda.com, an online video tutorial website, which features five- to 15-minute learning segments on everything from Google applications, web development and social media sites to video editing and software like Microsoft Office.
The Office of the Provost offers Learning Environment Grants for any professor who creates an assignment incorporating technology from a redesigned classroom. For example, instead of assigning a standard essay, professors can design multimedia presentations incorporating the new slide projectors.
Marley Weddington, a senior majoring in business, said people need to be made aware of technological advancements.
“I wish the school was more vocal about making their efforts known,” Weddington said. “I need another three years here to fully take advantage of resources I didn’t know existed until just recently.”
Metros said the technology initiatives are in response to the suggestions of USC students and professors from surveys, faculty focus groups and meetings with student government.
“As technology becomes an important part of students’ everyday life, more and more want to incorporate it into their education,” Metros said. “Professors are open to this as well.”
The Learning Environments group, in partnership with the Center for Scholarly Technology, administers surveys at the beginning and end of each semester to faculty and students teaching and taking classes in the renovated classrooms.
Surveys from fall 2010 and spring 2011 found 83 percent of professors and 84 percent of students believe current technology is appropriate for their needs, and 87 percent of professors believed the technology enhanced their ability to present information.
This feedback is continually reincorporated into the new designs, and the Learning Environments group has already made changes to the technology functions, lighting and furniture options and configurations in existing rooms.
Lawford Anderson, former director of the USC Center for Excellence in Teaching, said one downside to visual technology is the fear of “death by PowerPoint,”  the idea that if lecture material is written on slides and posted online students won’t bother showing up to class.
Nick Bradvica, a junior majoring in English, said the new classroom technology is making his life a little easier.
“The more advanced learning students are subjected to, the more advanced tools we need,” Bradvica said. “I don’t feel a disconnect from teachers because of technology; it actually makes me feel more connected to them and it’s easier for me to follow along with their lectures if I have it in front of me.”
Though  Thomas Habinek, classics department chair and professor, uses PowerPoint presentations to supplement his lectures with visual elements, he said he prefers the simplicity of going back to the basics.
“Read a lot, write a lot and engage with the professor,” Habinek said. “There’s really no replacement for good old-fashioned teaching.”
Though Metros insists there is no “one size fits all” technology for every discipline, the aim of these advancements is to provide students with a more engaging learning experience.
“Technology won’t make a bad teacher a good teacher, or a good teacher great,” Metros said. “It really comes down to a passion for sharing knowledge. Technology takes down the four walls of a classroom and gives an immediate context to learning.”

The USC Office of Admissions said it is making a greater effort to diversify its international student body by recruiting in South America for the first time next year.
Dean of Admissions Timothy Brunold said USC will begin recruiting in Brazil next year in 2012.
Abraham Lowenthal, professor of international relations and the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences president emeritus, said USC has a gap to fill in Latin America.
“USC is below where it should be in attracting Latin American students because the USC brand is weak and out of date in that region,” Lowenthal said. “Mexico’s leaders study at Harvard, Yale, MIT and Cornell, not at USC. USC’s dramatic rise in quality in many fields is not yet known or recognized in most Latin American countries.”
This year USC is recruiting undergraduate students in India for the first time. Admission’s full-time recruiters will take part in more international college fairs and will visit more high schools.
“We will being visiting eight countries this fall, which is an increase,” Brunold said. “Recruiters will be sent to Canada, Mexico, Japan, Singapore, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and India.”
Among the 15 percent of current USC freshmen that are international students, more than 40 countries are represented, but 332 out of the 435 international freshmen are from five countries: China, South Korea, Canada, India and Hong Kong. One or two students represent more than half of the countries represented.
Some students said they would like to see more international representation.
“I would like to meet people from more countries,” said Sean McElhenney, a junior majoring in critical studies. “Most of the international students I meet are from the same few countries, which is fine, but I would personally like to see some more international student diversity.”
Brunold said the university will continue to use the same tactics to recruit students internationally.
“We’re not really changing our method, but increasing our recruiting reach,” Brunold said. “It’s an expansion. Our methods are the same.”
The increased focus on getting more students to come from a variety of areas around the world is intended to expand the cultural richness of the campus.
“The benefits are the same as having geographical diversity among domestic students,” Brunold said. “There is always value in having people from different cultures and backgrounds.”
Brunold said admissions is considering other areas in which to recruit.
“It’s not that we don’t have a broader interest in further diversifying the student body, but we have to be certain of our resources before taking on a bigger endeavor,” Brunold said.
Lara Garcia, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, was born in Spain but holds dual citizenship in Spain and the United States.
“Bringing in people from an increasing number of different countries will help USC to be a more internationally well-known university,” Garcia said. “This way USC can have a higher level of education by bringing in the best students from all over the world.”
Garcia said USC needs to make a greater effort to make its presence known in more countries and that she would like to see more representation from Europe.
“I am from Spain and I didn’t know anything about USC until I came to [Los Angeles],” Garcia said. “On the other hand, UCLA is very well-known in Spain.”
Why?  We don’t have enough?

USC trustee Rick Caruso resigned from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission  on Wednesday amid criticism that his role with the university, which has expressed interest in controlling the stadium, has prevented him from serving the commission effectively.
Empty seat · USC trustee Rick Caruso said he will no longer serve on the Coliseum Commission because it is being poorly managed. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The governing body, which comprises representatives from the state, county and city, is expected to negotiate a master lease with USC to transfer control of the Coliseum from the commission to the university.
“Given the concern raised by some members of the commission about my dual role as a Trustee at the University of Southern California and as a Commissioner, I feel my ability to continue my work to transform this Commission and the effectiveness to assure the future reliability of the Coliseum may be restricted in the future,” Caruso said in his resignation letter.
USC acknowledged its desire to take control of the stadium, which hosts USC’s home football games, at the end of August. The university is currently using the Coliseum as part of a 25-year agreement that requires the university to give the commission 8 percent of ticket sales and $1.8 million annually, under the condition that the commission upgrades the stadium.
The commission has until today to provide USC with a plan for implementing the upgrades, according to the lease agreement. If the commission does not meet this obligation, the university can declare a default, Los Angeles City Councilman Bernard Parks told the Daily Trojan in August.
Parks, who also sits on the commission and whose council district includes the stadium, opposes the master lease out of a belief that the Coliseum, a publicly owned stadium, should not be controlled by a private institution.
Parks urged the panel to exclude Caruso from negotiations involving USC. An attorney for the commission told Caruso earlier in the month he would have to recuse himself from talks about the school’s lease, according to the Los Angeles Times.
“This commission may be well-intended, but I think they are lost. I think they’re absolutely lost,” Caruso said after the commission’s last meeting on Sept. 7. “They don’t understand business. … They don’t know how to manage, and they have allowed this facility to be completely mismanaged.”
Were the commission to default, the university could start the improvements to the stadium and bill the commission, with the possibility the commission might not be able to afford it, Parks said in August.
In his resignation letter, Caruso expressed support for USC’s greater involvement in the stadium’s operation.
“I strongly support the current direction of having USC take a lead operating role due to their historical and current use of the Coliseum, financial capability to ensure the viability of this historical landmark and positive commitment to the local community,” he said in his letter of resignation.
Both Parks and USC administrators declined to comment on Caruso’s resignation.

What film last weekend swatted away the heavy hitter Moneyball, took down the family adventure Dolphin Tale and proved girls would pick wild fauna over Taylor Lautner?
The Lion King, of course.
Disney’s 3-D re-release of the 1994 classic, which has netted $66.4 million so far, has cast such a siren song over the country that a family of four has no problem shelling out more than $60 for the 3-D experience, not including popcorn. Memory is worth the price, it seems, even in a rocky economy.
How has a movie that came out when we were watching Nickelodeon have the power to leave us spellbound? Welcome to the infinite magic of classic Disney.
Disney magic is a subtle, seductive creature. It is far from omnipotent — the box office bomb of 2002’s Treasure Planet caused a corporate slaughter, and few remember 2001’s lukewarm Atlantis: The Lost Empire.
When the magic does work, Disney’s alchemy ingrains itself in pop culture, sleeps in our collective conscience and recreates a vivid dream of childhood. Kiddos who grew up in the late ’80s and early ’90s encountered the Disney Renaissance, which produced classics such as Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.
Doctors and sociologists have written full-fledged books on the psychological impact of Disney films. But at its bare bones, the magic can be explained more simply.
For children, Disney films had it all — they were sweeping, melodic and simple. The details of real life imagery were toned down, making it easy for young eyes to track the action. The voices were pitched slightly higher and closer to a child’s own.
And anyone could get the story. No one needs to see the Hamlet parallels to understand The Lion King. No one needs to hear all the other thousand stories of Arabian Nights to get behind 1992’s Aladdin.
Sometimes, bold strokes speak louder than subtle ones. By breaking a story down to basic components — characters, motivations and conflicts — directors can find more success by telling a simple story well than by telling a complex story poorly.
For all of us, the opening strains of Arabian Nights are enough to send us back to childhood, a time everyone perceives as simpler. Childhood did not have taxes, midterms or car insurance. The childlike nature of Disney films allows everyone to remember a time of right and wrong instead of intimidating ambiguity.
Parents have also had reasons to like the films; Disney classics provided the perfect family outing once the kids could be trusted not to screech or throw popcorn in public. They presented a way to bond as a family without parents needing to referee. And as some parents would argue, Disney has displayed strong moral lessons and positive role models.
Thankfully, simple stories are not necessarily simple-minded. There is plenty for adults to admire in the striking art of 1991’s Beauty and the Beast or hilarious lyrics such as Gaston’s “I use antlers in all of my decorating!” In an age where kids’ humor is synonymous with fart jokes, Disney films carry their own nobility.
Today, in a world with a rocky economy and bleak news stories, being able to take the kids to a fun family film with substance might well be worth the stiff price of admission.
One might argue, however, that by perfecting the Disney formula, Disney stunted its own growth. Audiences were so used to a formula of starkly different virtuous good and impersonal evil that later films caused a dissonance. Though 1995’s Pocahontas performed decently at the box office, the film earned many negative reviews from critics and parents for its fierce, busty heroine and misrepresentation of Native Americans.
1996’s Hunchback of Notre Dame received heaps of critical praise but drew the ire of parents, most likely because of the villain’s rape-assuming ditty about the heroine or his neck-snapping murder of the hero’s mother. The dancing gargoyles kept grown-ups from seeing it as an adult drama but the lusty, tormented Frollo was too dark for some to consider it a kid’s film.
In the present counter-culture, some consider these films to be some of the most intriguing in Disney’s stable. Pocahontas was a visual and musical marvel and captured a touching, rather melancholy romance between its main characters. Hunchback of Notre Dame was praised for its artwork, darker nature and guts — for using “hell” in a song.
Still, it’s hard to know whether or not the Disney movies of yesteryear work in today’s more cynical era. Are kids today enjoying the re-release of The Lion King just as much as their older siblings did back in the age of Kenan & Kel and Goosebumps? The box office numbers, at least, seem to say yes.
In that sense, this re-release experiment might be one Disney wants to continue. Aladdin’s “A Friend Like Me” would be epic.

You know that uncomfortable feeling you get when your throat and stomach somehow mesh together? That awkward moment when your eyes start to water and you sit there squinting, not wanting to cry?
Poignant wit · Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s (right) portrayal of Adam proves to be moving and comical, while the supporting cast, including Anna Kendrick (left), excels at forming a vibrant web of characters. - Photo courtesy of Summit Entertainment, LLC
 
With 50/50, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen, you can expect this wonderful experience amid bouts of uproarious laughter and tender, honest moments.
The film tells the relatable story of Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a cautious 27-year-old with a meaningless job at the local radio station and a mediocre girlfriend by his side. When diagnosed with an uncommon form of spinal cancer, Adam’s life is turned upside down as he, his friends and family try to cope with the elephant in the room — his 50-50 chance of survival.
Kyle (Seth Rogen) tries to help his best friend cope with the pain by convincing him to exploit his cancer to get girls. And along for the ride are Adam’s unlikeable artist girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), his overprotective mother (Anjelica Huston), Alzheimer’s-inflicted father (Serge Houde) and an inexperienced, nervous therapist (Anna Kendrick); it’s hard to say if one actor shines above the rest in this witty dramedy.
Unfortunately, while Gordon-Levitt gives a great performance, he seems to be reprising his role in (500) Days of Summer. That’s not exactly his fault, however, with the similar Gordon-Levitt-singing-and-strolling sequence, the side-by-side action shots a la Summer’s party scene and the costuming. Specifically, in (500) Days of Summer, Tom euphorically dances about Los Angeles once he gets hooked on Summer; in 50/50, Adam happily grooves through hospital wings hooked on medication.
Yes, Gordon-Levitt works well as a stereotypical good-looking nice guy, but director Jonathan Levine could have refrained from the vast assortment of (500) Days of Summer references. It’s simply a little too much.
That said, Levine still works wonders with the film. After all, the entire premise of the picture was on thin ice to begin with. A comedy on cancer?  That’s touchy stuff to play around with.
Thankfully, it works. For every emotional sock to the gut, there’s an equally impressionable comedic retort, helpfully relieving battered hearts. Huston shines in her role as she successfully manipulates the emotional ups and downs of an overbearing, but loving, mother.
Unexpected gems Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer give exceptionally hilarious and touching performances as Adam’s partners-in-chemo. The film might have translated as young and inane because of its young cast, but the two older men, along with Huston and Houde, add credibility and believability to the movie. 50/50 isn’t a movie exclusively for a young audience, despite young leads Gordon-Levitt, Rogen and Kendrick. There’s a little something in this movie for everyone.
50/50 is emotionally intense and captivating. Remember that uncomfortable throat-imploding-into-stomach feeling mentioned earlier?  Every character magically provides one of those moments, even the obnoxiously amusing Rogen.
Will Reiser — writer, spinal-cancer survivor and friend of Rogen — took it upon himself to weave a story of his own cancer experience that explores the emotions on all sides of the equation: victim, friend, mother and lover.  The story is based on the emotional experience Reiser underwent upon discovering he had not only cancer but a weak chance of survival. In fact, that’s where the film’s heart stems from — Reiser’s honest and real life insight. 50/50 has all the bases covered.
Reiser’s smart-aleck script, Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s charisma and the solid performances of the entire cast ground a film that had the potential to come off as offensive and absurd. The picture is truly an ensemble piece, where the characters, plot lines and dialogue mesh together to form a well-rounded, entertaining work of art.
There’s a 100 percent chance you’ll leave the theater pining to spend time with your loved ones.
50/50 whether your shirt will be drenched in tears.

How much are you worth? According to UC Berkeley College Republicans, I am worth $1 for being Latina. But because I’m a female, I’m eligible for a $0.25 discount. How generous.
On Tuesday, UC Berkeley College Republicans hosted a satirical bake sale, titled “Increase Diversity” bake sale. At the event, cupcakes were available for purchase, but rates were determined upon a person’s gender and race. The price was $2 for a white person, $1.50 for Asian, $0.75 for black and $0.25 for Native American — with $0.25 off for females.
The bake sale aimed to exemplify how unfair it is to accept students into public universities in California based upon their race or gender.
Though this idea seemed well-intentioned as a mere voicing of opinion, the bake sale was simply taken too far, overshadowing the message the Berkeley College Republicans wanted to convey. In turn, it created controversy and  most students of all races and genders involved were deeply offended. There are many other avenues in which to get a point across, but selling food based on a person’s gender is completely inappropriate because of its discriminatory nature.
The way in which the Berkeley College Republicans decided to voice their opinion made it seem like racism is not serious — so much so that it’s appropriate to make a satirical event out of it. In all, the satire was taken too far.
Instead of encouraging conversation and discussion about whether or not making gender or race a decisive admissions factor is a good idea, the bake sale instead turned off students and made them not want to participate in any conversation with the Berkeley College Republicans. In essence, it failed miserably.
It’s baffling how something as serious as education could be equated with cupcakes, and I certainly don’t understand why a person’s race had to be incorporated into the event for the Berkeley College Republicans’ point to be made known effectively.
Proponents of the bake sale have argued the negative responses to the demonstration essentially prove the entire point. An organizer for CampusReform.org, a social networking site for Conservative students, wrote on the Facebook event page, “If the people are so offended about the race — and gender-based pricing, shouldn’t they also be offended when the Legislature does essentially the same thing for college admissions?”
Because of the blatantly offensive nature of the bake sale, Associated Students of the University of California called an emergency meeting the Sunday before the event.
According to the Daily Cal, the result of the meeting was that the senate approved a resolution stipulating the use of discrimination, whether in jest or seriousness, should be condemned — and I completely concur with this decision. Any sort of racism is uncalled for.

What is the gay, bi, and transgender pricing?
To point out a minor problem in most of these critiques, the author’s opinion is Anti-Affirmative Action, Anti-Bake sale. She states it in the last paragraph pretty clearly. 
However, most people already noticed the problem with your argument, that discriminatory or not, the bake-sale proved a point, no matter how much opponents of it heap onto it words like “Controversy”, “racist”, and “Discriminatory”.
“If the people are so offended about the race — and gender-based pricing, shouldn’t they also be offended when the Legislature does essentially the same thing for college admissions?”
I think that quote sums it up quite well. Although i agree that cupcakes and education are not anywhere near the same thing, it is merely stating a point and drawing a comparison. The pricing on the food wasn’t to discriminate it was to draw a correlation and make a statement. No one was forced to purchase anything, it was their choice. 
and i agree with the post above…. if all forms of discrimination should be condemned, then why is affirmative action okay?
So how is it that selling cupcakes with different prices based on race and gender is horrifying and terrible and offensive, while giving people an advantage (sometimes substantial) in college admissions based on race and gender is totally fine? 
I honestly don’t understand this. In this very article, you say *exactly* what the College Republicans are: that discrimination based on race and gender is a *bad* thing. And yet this seems to just sort of bounce off your forehead. 
The point of the bake sale: discrimination is bad.
The point of the people up in arms over the bake sale: discrimination is bad*. 
*except when done in favor of certain protected classes. 
And there’s the rub. That little asterisk. The College Republicans put a spotlight on it. And people in favor of it, rather than offering any cogent argument to support their position, started screeching to the heavens that they were offended that this double standard had been exposed. They did not engage with the argument presented by the College Republicans. Instead, they (and this article) try to ignore it, simply declaring it horribly offensive and thus unworthy of being taken seriously.
The bake sale was a success based on its intention to raise awareness and spur dialogue.  Mellissa, as an English major, you of all people should understand the value of an analogy.  And who told you that creating controversy is a bad thing?  On the contrary, it often generates action one way or another.  We may not agree on the outcome, but that’s OK.  The last time I checked, the First Amendment to the US Constitution is still in place.
Really? Any sort of discrimination should be condemned?
Like the admissions policies?
HILARIOUS.
I think this was a brilliant success in pointing out the astonishing hypocrisy of leftists.

As a university on the forefront of progress, UC Berkeley has had a reputation of being an open and tolerant atmosphere. So when the College Republicans club organized a bake sale that charged the buyer’s goods based on their race or gender, many were shocked. But when done to prove a point, people should realize there is really nothing about which to be offended, nor are there grounds to attack such a bake sale.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
Regardless of one’s opinion on the issue of affirmative action satirized in the UC Berkeley’s College Republican’s “Increase Diversity” bake sale, the backlash the event’s organizers have received is unreasonable. It is hard to believe people’s sense of entitlement to political correctness could produce death threats and such intolerant opposition.
But controversy is often the best way to draw attention to one’s cause and get one’s voice heard, something students evidently understand.
In an interview on John King USA on Tuesday, California state senator Democrat Ed Hernandez  called Berkeley College Republicans President Shawn Lewis, and the other club members “insensitive” for planning such an event. The senator might be correct in using this adjective, but then again, it is not the citizen’s job to be “sensitive” in his or her political activism. The very reason citizens become active in the public sphere is to promote what they believe, and in almost all areas of politics, people will disagree.
Just a few hours after the event’s Facebook invitation page went online, students posted multiple angry comments and threats of physical violence. Lewis said one person even threatened to bring a spiked baseball bat to the group’s table during the sale.
The group was forced to shut down its lunchtime table setups because of these reactions, which speaks to the immature and undemocratic nature in which opponents of the bake sale acted. Fortunately, Berkeley College Republican members did not let this stop them from following through with the sale.
The way in which Berkeley’s College Republicans went about getting their point across was indeed controversial.
It is dissapointing many Americans, especially the students who will be the future leaders of our nation and the world, are so thin-skinned when it comes to others exercising First Amendment rights in a way that does not perfectly exclude all emotion and consider everyone else’s potential feelings. Berkeley College Republicans did not put on their bake sale to persecute any group of people, but to express their disapproval of a political idea.
Instead of civilly considering what the Berkeley College Republicans had to say, opponents of their event immediately got tunnel-vision when they heard the word “race.”
Removing the passionate edge to politics the Cal bake sale displayed would simply be harmful to free speech, politics and democracy as a whole.

On Sept. 28, Amazon launched its much-anticipated tablet. Christened Kindle Fire, the 7-inch tablet is priced at $199 and is available for pre-order, with delivery Nov. 15. Amazon has also significantly modified its kindle line of e-reader devices, with 6-inch non-touch B&W Kindle e-reader now available for $79, and the Kindle Touch ad-supported version for $99 and $139 without it.
Here are some basic specs of the newest addition to the tablet market:











The tablet had been expected to hit the market prior to the shopping season, and its timing has proven spot-on. At $199, it is the cheapest 7-inch tablet in the market except for Lenovo’s newly announced, but not yet launched, A1 tablet (running on Android), which is similarly priced.
The rest of the competition is at least $50 costlier, with both Samsung’s 7” Galaxy Tab and Blackberry’s Playbook costing $100 more. Apple’s iPad, with a 10.1-inch form factor, costs $500.
Pricing Strategy
So, why is Amazon able to sell so cheap? Well, the answer undoubtedly lies in the Internet behemoth’s ability to provide a complete eco-system of hardware, app and content all by itself. Amazon Prime members have access to all of Amazon’s streaming content with thousands of titles, with online cloud storage available for free.
Amazon also has a fully functional Amazon App Store of its own. Unfortunately, it predictably has no access to the open Android Market, managed by Google. This kind of restrictive software management is reminiscent of the hugely popular iPad. However, with Kindle Fire running an Android-based OS, a solution to running those Apps could be found before the tablet’s delivery starts.
Amazon Prime membership costs $79 per year and in addition to free two-day shipping, also offers customers access to Amazon’s fast expanding collection of titles. Amazon’s ability to sell Kindle cheap, while a continuation of its long-term policy of profits through quantity, is heavily aided by its earning from the Prime Membership program. The 30-day free trial of the program being offered with the device is ample indicator of Amazon’s strategy.
Missing Features
A couple of things missing from the device, compared to similar (albeit costlier) 7-inch Android tablets, are camera for video conferencing and microSD memory expansion slots. The lack of the latter is another indicator of Amazon’s efforts at carving a product line around its online content. However, this has the potential to be a deal breaker for people looking to fill their tablets with personal data not found on Amazon.
Effect on Competition
Kindle Fire has the potential to take over a significant portion of the 7-inch tablet market. The price point is much lower as compared to some key competitors in the segment. However, it is unlikely to eat into iPad’s share of the tablet market. The two devices, priced at $200 and $500 respectively, could well turn out to be the market leaders in the long run.

The tablet had been expected to hit the market prior to the shopping season, and its timing has proven spot-on. At $199, it is the cheapest 7-inch tablet in the market except for Lenovo’s newly announced, but not yet launched, A1 tablet (running on Android), which is similarly priced.
The rest of the competition is at least $50 costlier, with both Samsung’s 7” Galaxy Tab and Blackberry’s Playbook costing $100 more. Apple’s iPad, with a 10.1-inch form factor, costs $500.
Pricing Strategy
So, why is Amazon able to sell so cheap? Well, the answer undoubtedly lies in the Internet behemoth’s ability to provide a complete eco-system of hardware, app and content all by itself. Amazon Prime members have access to all of Amazon’s streaming content with thousands of titles, with online cloud storage available for free.
Amazon also has a fully functional Amazon App Store of its own. Unfortunately, it predictably has no access to the open Android Market, managed by Google. This kind of restrictive software management is reminiscent of the hugely popular iPad. However, with Kindle Fire running an Android-based OS, a solution to running those Apps could be found before the tablet’s delivery starts.
Amazon Prime membership costs $79 per year and in addition to free two-day shipping, also offers customers access to Amazon’s fast expanding collection of titles. Amazon’s ability to sell Kindle cheap, while a continuation of its long-term policy of profits through quantity, is heavily aided by its earning from the Prime Membership program. The 30-day free trial of the program being offered with the device is ample indicator of Amazon’s strategy.
Missing Features
A couple of things missing from the device, compared to similar (albeit costlier) 7-inch Android tablets, are camera for video conferencing and microSD memory expansion slots. The lack of the latter is another indicator of Amazon’s efforts at carving a product line around its online content. However, this has the potential to be a deal breaker for people looking to fill their tablets with personal data not found on Amazon.

In a positive turn of events for women’s rights, a Saudi Arabian woman’s sentence for driving was revoked this week. King Abdullah made the decision not to give the woman her original punishment of 10 lashes.
The outcome is the first of its kind, and came just two days following Abdullah’s announcement that women will be able to vote for the first time in the country’s next elections in 2015.
News of the outcome initially spread thanks to the tweets of Princess Amira al-Taweel, the wife of Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who wrote “Thanks to our beloved king. I’m sure all Saudi women will be so happy, I know I am.”
Shaima Ghassaniya was initially handed the sentence for driving without first being granted the government’s permission. Though no specific law bans women from driving, it is widely considered forbidden. Saudi Arabia is the only country that essentially bans women from driving, and although women are now granted the right to vote, they still are subject to other restrictions, such as needing a male guardian’s permission to travel or work abroad.
Women’s rights organizations have applauded Saudi King Abdullah’s actions, which reflect past changes he has made in favor of women. For example, the king opened the first co-educational university in 2009. He also promised that he will work to provide more jobs for women, which aligns with his plan to reduce the country’s economic dependence on oil.

“Killing Me Softly” is one of those songs that transcends generations. Whether it’s because of the catchiness of the tune or how amusing it is to parody, the song sticks with people of all ages. Roberta Flack, the multi-talented artist behind this hit, is looking to expand her repertoire by channeling the energy of another oldie-but-goodie.
Released Tuesday was “We Can Work It Out,” the lead single from Flack’s first album in more than eight years of being out of the spotlight.
And what type of album will this be? A Beatles cover LP.
Flack plans to include many of the Beatles’ major hits on her album, including “Hey Jude,” “Here Comes the Sun” and “Let It Be.”
Cliché? Maybe. But can Flack do any wrong? Not really. The singer is known for releasing quality projects ever since her debut “First Take.” But things haven’t been perfect for Flack in the process of recording this album.
While transporting audio copies of her recently recorded tracks in New York City, Flack left the suitcase of songs inside a city cab. After a few phone calls and an anxious adventure around the city, Flack was able to track down the cab and the suitcase, thus avoiding a lot of flack from her label by retrieving the tapes.
Now, with tapes in hand and recording going steadily, the as-yet-untitled album looks like its well on its way to closing out production.
The 73-year-old surely has the potential to work magic on the Beatles catalog. You can get the first single exclusively on iTunes now.

Seven high school students in Long Island, New York, were arrested Tuesday in an alleged SAT cheating scandal. Samuel Eshaghoff faces felony fraud charges, while six others are charged with misdemeanors.
Eshaghoff, 19, is accused of impersonating six Great Neck North High students between 2010 and 2011, in which he allegedly charged between $1,500 and $2,500 to take the SAT test for them. He supposedly used false identification and took the tests at schools other than Great Neck so he would not be recognized by test proctors. Prosecutors said he scored between 2140 and 2220 on the tests he took for the students, some of whom are already in college.
According to Kathleen Rice, Nassau County’s District Attorney, authorities underwent investigations after hearing rumors about the cheating. Suspects were identified when the test takers’ grade point averages were compared with their scores, in which wide discrepancies were found with six students.
The Educational Testing Service, which administers the SAT test for The College Board, will now establish new methods to prevent cheating, such as photographing the students as they take the tests. Students will also have to show an admission ticket and photo ID, which can include a state-issued driver’s license, state-issued non-driver ID, school identification card, passport or other government-issued document.
According to USA Today, Eshaghoff has pleaded not guilty to charges of scheming to defraud, criminal impersonation and falsifying business records. He is currently a student at Emory University in Atlanta after studying at the University of Michigan his freshman year. Eshaghoff posted $500 bail and is due back in court Oct. 11, potentially facing four years in prison if convicted.

As of May 1, 2012, Sony Pictures Entertainment will no longer pay for 3-D glasses, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
The company recently notified theaters of the change, giving them time to develop a new policy for funding the glasses that have become commonplace for many moviegoers.
According to the report, glasses for smaller films can cost from $1.5 million to $2 million, while larger films can exceed $5 million and up to $10 million. Given the number of films catering to 3-D technology, it’s understandable why Sony no longer wants to fund the glasses, especially considering how many pairs probably don’t find their way into the nifty recycle bins outside the theaters.
So what does this change mean for you? With Sony no longer willing to pay the costs for the 3-D eyewear, theaters will have to come up with effective ways to afford them. Sony has suggested theaters charge customers for the glasses. That’s right, no more freebies.
Though other countries are already used to the extra cost , such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy and Spain, Americans might have a difficult time adjusting to the additional charge on top of the already pricey movie tickets.
In the past, 20th Century Fox has tried to sever ties with the expenses of 3-D glasses, to no avail. Sony, however, seems quite firm in its stance. Theater chains will likely not want to fund the glasses themselves, so if you are a fan of the 3-D experience, prepare your wallet for a little extra surcharge come May.

In what the CDC is calling the deadliest foodbourne outbreak in a decade, Listeria-infected cantaloupes in 18 states have sickened 72 people, killing 13 so far.
Officials say the epidemic will most likely worsen as the government struggles to trace how far the bacteria have spread into other states. In addition, the symptoms of Listeria often take up to two months to develop in those who have been affected; the first case appeared Sept. 12.
The initial contamination has been linked to Jensen Farms in Colorado. Jensen Farms said it distributes its cantaloupes to 25 states throughout the country.
“If it’s not Jensen farms, it’s OK to eat,” Dr. Thomas Frieden, CDC director, said in a media conference call Wednesday. “But if you can’t confirm that it’s not Jensen farms, then it’s best to throw it out.”
Grocery sticker labels for cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms might include those that read “Colorado Grown,” “Frontera Produce,” “Jensenfarms.com” or “Sweet Rocky Fords.”
Like E. Coli and Salmonella, Listeria is passed through contaminated food and can cause fever, muscle aches and gastrointestinal symptoms. The illness usually affects those who have compromised immune systems, such as the elderly or pregnant.
“We do anticipate there will be a rising number of cases in the days and weeks to come,” Frieden said.

Guns N’ Roses, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, the Cure and Heart were among the first-time nominees announced Tuesday for potential induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as the class of 2012.
Other new nominees include rap duo Eric B. & Rakim, blues guitarist and singer Freddie King, British rock group the Small Faces, R&B band the Spinners and funk group Rufus, which launched the career of lead singer Chaka Khan.
The list of potential inductees also features acts who have been previously eligible, such as rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, rap trio the Beastie Boys, singer-songwriter Laura Nyro, singer-songwriter Donovan, R&B group War and disco diva Donna Summer.
The 15 nominees are expected to be whittled down to the new class of 2012 this December, before they are inducted into the Hall of Fame in New York during a ceremony in March 2010.
At least 25 years must pass from an act’s debut recording before they are eligible to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.
The ceremony could serve as a stage for a dramatic reunion for Guns N’ Roses, which currently only is comprised of founding member Axl Rose. Former members, such as famed guitarist Slash, might decide to reunite with Rose for one night if they are inducted into rock ‘n’ roll’s most prestigious club.

Though USC is the most internationally diverse university in the country, diversity might not translate to friend groups, according to a recent study by the Group Process & Intergroup Relations.
The study concluded that as large universities become more diverse, students tend to only make friends with those who share their own interests and backgrounds.
The study refers to the term “social selection” — the idea that students will actively select friends who are ethnically similar and have like interests.
USC, with its large international population, seems to follow this trend. The Freshman Profile and Admisson Information 2011-2012 revealed an increase in the international student population.
“Greater human diversity within an environment leads to less personal diversity within dyads,” the study said.
One reason for this might be that students’ unfamiliarity with college leads them to form friends with those similar to themselves, said Linda Wong, executive director of the Center for Urban Education at the USC Rossier School of Education.
“For a lot of freshman students, attending college may be their first experience away from home and with such unfamiliar surroundings,” Wong said. “I am not surprised by the study, but I do believe it is the job of the university to create an environment that enables students to establish diverse relationships.”
In comparison with last year’s Freshman Profile, the number of international students increased 4 percent. Among freshmen, 15 percent tends to come from areas such as China, South Korea, Canada and India.
Of enrolled freshmen at USC, 7 percent identifies as African-American, 12 percent as Latino/Hispanic, 2 percent as Native American/Pacific Islander and 25 percent as Asian. Of freshmen, 39 percent are Caucasian, compared with 42 percent in 2010 statistics.
Mayur Shah, an undeclared freshman, said the study accurately depicts the social environment at USC.
“Walking around campus, I see people of the same ethnicity hanging out together a lot more than I see a mix,” Shah said. “This is understandable, though, because a lot of us are looking for familiarity in a new environment, and especially for internationals, I think it is a difficult transition.”
Wong said the university needs to proactively integrate diversity into all aspects of school life in order to create a diverse environment on campus.
“The study shows that simply creating a diverse campus won’t necessarily create a diverse individual,” Wong said. “Students must be willing to go beyond comfort zones while the university must create an environment that gives them that opportunity.”
Ryan Choi, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering, said he attempts to find friends who match his interests, not necessarily his ethnicity.
“Just because I’m Asian doesn’t mean I only want Asian friends,” Choi said. “For me, social selection just means finding nice people who are accepting of my interests and ideas.”
A diverse community is crucial for a university and prepares students for life after college, Wong said.
“Exposure to diversity is critical because that’s the nature of the world we live in,” Wong said. “At some point, we all experience it. To have an opportunity in a university environment will better prepare students for the real world.”
