There is a very famous scene in the beginning of the movie Field of Dreams, when a mystical voice tells the main character, played by Kevin Costner, “If you build it, he will come.” Since the iconic sports film’s release in 1989, the quote has often been misattributed as, “If you build it, they will come.” And though it might not have come directly from the movie, there is no statement more emblematic of the USC rooting mentality than that one.
Yes, Field of Dreams took place in the cornfields of Iowa while USC sports events happen in the bustling metropolis of downtown Los Angeles. Yet the principle of attending games only to see a polished, successful team rings true for the majority of USC’s fanbase.
The phenomenon of lackadaisical attendance for average teams and impassioned support for championship caliber squads has long been in effect for the Trojan faithful. This year is no different. The USC-Colorado men’s basketball game on Sunday, Feb. 16 played out like most games this season. The Trojans kept it competitive for a while, until a prolonged scoring drought took them out of striking distance.
Though this predictable pattern of gameplay was not unique, the Trojans-Buffs faceoff was the first USC home basketball game I had watched on TV as opposed to in person. I was struck by how empty the Galen Center appeared on television. Sure, it was a three-day weekend, but I doubt that the break led to such a staggering drop in attendance. I imagine most games appear like this on television, a beautiful state of the art facility struggling to just fill out the lower sections of the arena.
The apathy of the overall Trojan fanbase this year was magnified after watching the North Carolina-Duke showdown on Thursday night. The amount of intensity and passion emanating from the stands in that battle made the cheering in the USC-Colorado game look like a high school affair.
The previous statement is not a critical referendum on our fan base — far from it, in fact. It is just an observation. I think the atmosphere at USC games is so different from other elite athletic programs for one simple reason: location.
One of the reasons USC is so popular nationally among recruits is its proximity to downtown Los Angeles and Hollywood. LA is a big city, with some of the most popular attractions in the world. Though these characteristics are great for attracting recruits, such an incredible town makes it difficult to develop a rabid fanbase.
This isn’t just applicable to college basketball. Even here, where pigskin is king, we consistently fail to fill up the Coliseum when USC football is mediocre. Sure, everyone was celebrating on the field after that incredible Stanford victory. Yet I remember a different atmosphere back in the nascent stages of the season, in the dark days of the Kiffin era. That same Coliseum, as raucous as it was against the Cardinal, was silent for the majority of the Utah State game. Besides the occasional “boo” for another screen pass, one might have confused the stadium’s decibel level for that of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles down the street.
Admittedly, that was one of the first noon games in recent USC football history, but the underwhelming attendance level is still proof that the Trojan fanbase only extends a full effort for a winner, regardless of the sport. The simple reason is that there are other things to do on the weekends in Los Angeles.
This isn’t Tuscaloosa, Ala. or El Paso, Texas, where the college team is the best entertainment in town. A school across town faces a similar predicament. I grew up going to both UCLA and USC events. Much like USC in football, UCLA had tremendous attendance in basketball when they went to three straight final fours. Pauley Pavilion was electric during that period. Yet when the team struggled afterward, attendance decreased dramatically. It’s not a USC or UCLA thing; it’s simply a byproduct of the city we live in.
Many East Coast analysts and even some USC beat writers use this “fair-weather fan” mentality as fuel to criticize the Trojan athletic program as a whole. And even though that notion will always be incredibly annoying, I now look at our fanbase’s attitude in a whole new light.
I’ve had the opportunity to watch the second half of almost every sporting event this year from midcourt or the 50-yard line. That just doesn’t happen for students in Baton Rouge, La. or Lexington, Ky. When USC teams are “good,” the rooting experience rivals any other school in the country, for one simple reason. When USC fans get excited, we aren’t cheering for a first-round tournament exit or a Holiday Bowl berth. We are rooting for excellence, and anything less is unacceptable.
I have full faith Andy Enfield and Steve Sarkisian will build powerhouse programs soon enough. Before long, the Coliseum and Galen Center will be rocking. Because when those USC programs are built, the fans will come.

One thing is that all the basketball games are televised. Product is less than mediocre to have to deal with
distance, traffic, parking, and costs especially for a week night game. Whatever promotions are done to
attract fans have little incentive for the effort needed to actually be there in person. Thought from the title
you were talking about baseball. The fact is a large majority of USC supporters have no interest in any
sport outside of football unless family & real close friends of the athlete. You are off base on the Coliseum,
the place draws well even though not capacity which is very large. The athletic dept. keeps raising the price
of season tickets which is tough on fixed income seniors.
Well put.
You want me to drive downtown, pay for parking, pay to see the game, and drive back home after spending $100 for average seats and three to four hours for two people. 
RIGHT!

The Women of Troy suffered two heart-wrenching losses over the weekend, falling to No. 4 Stanford 64-59 on Friday after being up by as much as 16 points in the first half before losing to No. 18 California 76-67 on Sunday.
Senior day · USC senior forward Cassie Harberts scored 18 points in yesterday’s loss to Cal. Every senior scored in the team’s final home game. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
 
Despite another victory for the Cardinal (25-2, 14-1), who claimed at least a share of the Pac-12 title, the Women of Troy (16-12, 9-7) showed much improvement since their last game against Stanford, a 27-point loss on Jan. 27.
Decked out in their special pink uniforms for Breast Cancer Awareness, with Lisa Leslie sitting courtside, the Women of Troy battled until the end, playing a hard-fought game against one of the top teams in the country. But the combination of an inability to knock down high percentage shots in the paint and allowing the Cardinal’s best weapon, Chiney Ogwumike (27 points), to dominate in the post led to another USC defeat.
“I felt we started the game with great intensity, focus and drive,” said USC head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. “[But] we couldn’t sustain that for two halves. In the second half I thought we came out, we were a little tired, and we started to not execute as much.”
USC had no answer for Ogwumike, who was penetrating the basket, knocking down jumpers and leading the charge back on defense. Going into halftime, however, the Women of Troy seemed as though they had a handle on the perennial national title contenders, leading 37-30.
As expected, on offense, senior forward Cassie Harberts was double-teamed the entire game. As a result, Harberts slightly struggled, making just 5 of 16 shots from the field for 12 points. Junior guard Ariya Crook had to pick up the scoring load, pouring in 24 points.
The start of the second half was the beginning of the end for the Women of Troy, who came out looking like an entirely different team. Solid offensive rebounding helped keep the Women of Troy alive, but their lackluster offensive execution helped the Cardinal escape with a win.
As Stanford locked down its efforts, USC slumped to 22 shooting percentage from the floor in the second half, finishing the game at 36 percent while Stanford wrapped things up at 45 percent. The Women of Troy looked mentally and physically exhausted, something they admitted after the game.
“We were tired in the second half,” Crook said. “The shots we took in the first half, we couldn’t make them in the second half because either our legs were gone or our focus was not there.”
In the final minutes of the game, the Women of Troy attempted their last effort to pull off the upset. Crook knocked down a huge three-pointer with 18 seconds left on the clock to put the Women of Troy within four. But Stanford guard Bonnie Samuelson knocked down two free throws before Alexyz Vaioletama missed a three-point heave to give the game its final six-point margin.
USC hoped to rebound against Cal, but Senior Day for the Women of Troy did not end up as they would have liked, as the squad was outpaced by a determined California squad at the Galen Center.
USC took the first lead of the game, but Cal fired back with a strong effort from the floor in the first half. The Bears hit at a 52 percent clip through the first 20 minutes of play, while USC was at 43 percent to trail Cal 34-30 at the break. The Bears kept that pace rolling through the second half as well, finishing up the game at 51 percent with USC just off the mark at 44 percent. Cal also won out on the boards 38-30.
The Bears started the second half with a 12-0 surge to take a 46-30 lead. Desiree Bradley snapped the run with a score down low with 16:15 on the clock. USC got the deficit down to single digits in the last two minutes, but didn’t get closer than nine to the stubborn Bears. Cal was comfortably in the double bonus while holding only five fouls of its own as the game ground down to a final 76-67 Cal victory.
USC now heads off to Utah and Colorado for the final week of regular season action. The Trojans will visit the Utes for a rare Thursday clash at 7 p.m. MT before heading to Boulder, Colo. to take on the Buffs at 12 p.m. MT on Sunday. After suffering three losses in a row, the Women of Troy are now squarely on the bubble for the NCAA tournament.
“We have to win some games and do well in our [conference] tournament to be considered as a team that makes it to the NCAA,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I think we understand that, and I think we’re up for the challenge.”

The Trojans worked for the win on Sunday afternoon and the laborious 12-inning effort paid off. When all hopes of a win seemed dashed, with USC trailing by a run down to their last out, redshirt junior Omar Cotto Lozada launched a soaring three-run, walk-off home run into the trees down the right field line for his first-ever collegiate home run.
Heroic effort · The Trojans were down to their final out in the bottom of the 12th inning when outfielder Omar Cotto Lozada delivered a game-winning 3-run home run. Lozada came into the game batting .143. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
“I really have no words right now. It felt amazing,” Lozada said, all smiles. “I’m just happy we got the win and we’re 7-0. I’m happy for that. It’s so unreal, so amazing. I’m just speechless right now.”
With Lozada’s booming homer, USC protected an undefeated 7-0 record for the second time in three years. The win also marked the team’s second straight series sweep, this time of North Dakota State in the first series this season for the Bison.
“To get sweeps back to back weekends, that’s really hard to do,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said. “I don’t care who you’re playing, where you’re playing, what you’re doing.”
Sophomore Kyle Twomey returned to the mound for the Trojans. The left hander kept the Trojans in the game, allowing only one run in a 5 1/3 inning-outing in which he fanned six.
Twomey threw four scoreless innings until a bout of trouble and multiple defensive miscues found the Trojans in the fifth. The sophomore allowed a leadoff single, and a second Bison batter reached on a shortstop error, which quickly became a first and third situation after a stolen base. North Dakota State braved a suicide squeeze attempt, and in ill-advised and unsuccessful Trojan attempt to pin the runner at the plate, all runners were safe and the Bison took a 1-0 lead. Senior reliever James Guillen would finish the inning, but allow another run before his day ended.
Until the eighth inning, USC was unable to take advantage of many scoring opportunities including three leadoff singles, stranding six runners. Down by two runs in the eighth, however, sophomore designated hitter AJ Ramirez drew a walk and stole second, setting the scene for senior third baseman Kevin Swick. On the two-out payoff pitch, Swick singled up the middle to an eruption of cheers. With eerie similarity to a Bison play just an inning prior, freshman Jeremy Martinez sent a soaring double past the diving left fielder to tie the game.
In a display of offensive prowess, USC thrashed North Dakota State on Saturday, scoring in four consecutive innings for a resounding 9-0 victory. Equally impressive was the performance by senior Bob Wheatley, who pitched six scoreless innings, allowing only three hits and striking out four. Add that to a nearly flawless bullpen, which collectively allowed only one hit over three innings, and you get one of the most solid outings from the Trojan team thus far this season.
USC leaped ahead early in the second inning with three runs off four hits, including a double from senior first baseman Jake Hernandez, who went 2 for 3 in the game with 2 RBI. In a game in which eight Trojan batters had hits and five had multiple hits, the loudest might have come off the bat of junior second baseman Dante Flores who launched a two-run blast to right in the fourth inning for his first home run of the year.
The Trojans began the weekend series with their third walk-off in seven games this season, though this was the first settled without dipping into extra innings. USC trailed by three runs in the eighth inning — their largest deficit thus far this season — but staged a late comeback made possible by a pair of Bison errors to ultimately win 4-3.
“I think the guys are feeling like right now that they can come back at any time,” Hubs said. “We’re kind of the cardiac kids right now.”
Junior ace Wyatt Strahan found himself in a pitcher’s duel against North Dakota State’s Dave Ernst. Strahan held Bison batters hitless through 5 2/3 innings until the no-hitter was finally broken up in the sixth inning.
The right hander would allow all three Bison runs on five hits in 7 2/3 innings of work, striking out eight batters and walking only one.
USC was able to manufacture two runs in the bottom of the eighth, and after a shutdown inning from freshman reliever Jeff Paschke, the Trojans faced their final three outs trailing by two. After a walk and a single, an infield error by North Dakota State loaded the bases for sophomore center fielder Timmy Robinson. Robinson laced the game-winning, two-run single to left field.
With four walk-offs in just seven games, the Trojan tenacity has been a staple of success thus far this season, but while exciting, Hubbs knows it’s not sustainable.
“They’ve done a great job of fighting, never feeling like they’re out of anything, playing until the last strike,” Hubbs said. “As long as we continue to do that, I think we’ll have success. Are we going to be able to win like that every time? Absolutely not. We know that.”
For the first time this season, USC will hit the road to take on Long Beach State at 6 p.m. Tuesday. The Trojans lost to the Dirtbags in a scrimmage this season, 4-3.

On Sunday, student organization Kicks for Kids, a soccer league for special needs children, held its first game of the new season at McCarthy Quad.
Kicks for Kids aims to promote  a healthy lifestyle through physical activity. The organization was founded by its current president, Zade Shakir, a senior majoring in biology and international relations.
Shakir started the program last fall after being inspired by his involvement with Spirits in Action, USC’s version of the Special Olympics. After speaking with a parent, Shakir realized there was a lack of resources available for kids with developmental disabilities, particularly in organized sports.
Growing up, Shakir said, soccer was a major part of his life, with some of his best memories taking place out on the field. He felt a responsibility to give special needs children the same opportunity.
“I wanted to create an avenue where kids could come have fun, get fit, bring their friends and families to have similar memories,” Shakir said.
Additionally, the club is aimed at combating the correlation between obesity and children with developmental disabilities. The weekly Kicks for Kids soccer games provide kids with the chance to run around, make friends and form relationships with the student volunteers.
Each player is paired with a volunteer that he or she generally stays with each week. Adwight Risbud, a sophomore majoring in religious studies and human biology, described his time with one of the students.
“During my first experience with Kicks for Kids, I was paired up with a buddy, Aidan, who is a 6-year-old with Down’s syndrome, and I was with him for the next five weeks,” Risbud said. “We were able to form a great relationship.”
Risbud is also in charge of player recruitment, which entails reaching out to schools and families to spread the word about Kicks for Kids. Schools in the surrounding area with special needs programs have been incredibly receptive to the organization, and the parents have an advisory board to give their ideas and input on the weekly activities.
The parents also helped put the club in contact with special guests such as celebrity trainer Dion Jackson and the Los Angeles Laker Girls.
Jackson, who has worked with celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Carrie Fisher and Dustin Hoffman, gave participants and parents healthy lifestyle tips. He also showed the participants exercises and stretches they can incorporate before they play in their soccer games.
The Laker Girls also provided encouragement and inspiration to the children by taking the time to talk and play with them.
The success of Kicks for Kids is not only derived from the parents and celebrity guests, but also from other student organizations. Groups such as the Helenes, Spirit Leaders and the pre-health honor society donate their time each week. Shakir made a big effort to talk to pre-health and occupational therapy students to give them the chance to work with kids who could be similar to their future patients.
More than 50 volunteers came together to make this year’s season kick off another success.                 Rima Al-Rabadi, a junior majoring in global health and a member of the  Helenes, noted the program was equally beneficial to the students and kids.
“For the students, it is rewarding to see how just spending the morning with a kid can make their day,” Al-Rabadi said. “For the kids, they have an incredible opportunity to create relationships and interact with other kids like them. Overall, it is a unifying and rewarding experience.”

In the past 20 years, USC has strengthened all its unreinforced masonry buildings on campus in an effort to ensure earthquake safety.
“USC has been pretty proactive, but the big worry is the rest of L.A. has a lot of concrete buildings that no one is doing anything with,” said Gregg Brandow, professor of engineering practice in USC’s Sonny Astani Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
Data compiled by the University of California show that there are  nearly 1,500 concrete buildings in Los Angeles that could be at risk in a major earthquake.
Berkeley released its research to the public on Jan. 25. The list included all concrete buildings in Los Angeles constructed before the 1976 building code. This building code required ductile detailing of the reinforcing bars in concrete to provide additional strength to the structures. The university researchers gave the list to Los Angeles officials and released a copy to the Los Angeles Times in response to a public records request.
“We’re interested in running an analysis of earthquake losses,” said Jonathan Stewart, co-principal investigator of the study. “We’re getting a sense for the scale of impact in dollars and lives lost to craft public policy to change the problem.” Stewart is also the department chair of civil and environmental engineering at UCLA.
The study listed seven buildings located on the USC campus. Yet Associate Senior Vice President for Campus Development and Facilities Management Joe Back said that three of the addresses are inaccurate, and the remaining four have been inspected and meet seismic standards.
The four buildings named were Parkside Apartments, Parkside Residential Building, Fluor Tower and United University Church, the last of which is not owned by USC. Back said Parkside Residential Building is located at the 920 West 37th Street location which the study listed; The description given in the L.A. Times article, however, identifies a smaller, one-story building which was demolished.
Parkside Residential Building is one of the newest buildings on campus and meets seismic standards, Back said. Additionally, Parkside Apartments has already received a seismic upgrade, and Fluor Tower has been inspected and determined to meet seismic standards as well, he said.
“All of our occupied buildings meet seismic standards,” Back wrote in an email. “USC continuously looks to identify upgrade opportunities in our buildings and executes a significant amount of work each year that includes upgrades in seismic performance, disabled access, heating/cooling systems and technology.”
Stewart said the study addressed the fact that the list might not be 100 percent accurate. The researchers have not made any conclusions about the safety of the buildings.
Stewart said the purpose of Berkeley’s study was to raise awareness of buildings that would be a potential threat if a large earthquake were to strike, as well as force the city to implement policies that will address this problem.
“It will be interesting to see whether any sort of policy initiative is taken by the city of Los Angeles to do something about the problem,” Stewart said. “We saw just last week that Santa Monica funded a study to do a similar catalog of buildings. That’s a good sign. We would like to see cities taking this problem seriously.”
The researchers’ data shows that it is crucial to update the buildings that cause a potential threat because of the possibility for extreme damage and lost lives. If a 7.15 magnitude earthquake occurred on the Puente Hills fault beneath Downtown Los Angeles, It could cause $20 billion worth of damage and 300 to 2,000 casualties depending on the time of day, Stewart said.
In order to do more research on the topic, James Anderson, professor of civil engineering and environmental engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering, submitted an application for a grant which will allow researchers to look at the various buildings in question to predict what the consequences would be of an earthquake.
“We want to create a tool to analytically predict what the consequence would be for these buildings,” Anderson said. “For example, three years ago in Mexico City, there were buildings reviewed by engineers that reported no sign of damage, and yet they collapsed, so that simulates a need for an analytical tool that can quantify this.”
Thomas Jordan, professor of earth sciences at the Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences and director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, cited the importance of this type of research.
“We’ve been proactive at USC, but seismically it’s been quiet in Southern California for a long time,” Jordan said. Since we can’t know when another will happen, we worry that whole region might wake up and it might not be just one, but a sequence of major earthquakes, which is a concern.”

Women and Youth Supporting Each Other held Future Options Day on Saturday, an annual event meant to educate local middle school students about planning for high school, college and the future.

Approximately 50 eighth-grade students came for the event, which included a presentation from nonprofit organization Helping Young People Excel as well as a Q&A session with past participants of the program who are current high school sophomores.
HYPE provides talented            low-income students in Los Angeles with services to help students gain admission to universities, finance their education and succeed in high school and life in general.
The eighth-grade girls come from Los Angeles Academy Middle School, Clinton Middle School, Camino Nuevo Charter Academy and George Washington Carver Middle School, all situated within a five-mile radius from campus.
The event focused on informing and preparing students to succeed in high school, college and their future lives. HYPE speaker Rachel Torrey handed out a sheet that asked the young women questions about their dream job, the college major they needed for that job and companies in Los Angeles related to the field.
WYSE is a nationally recognized nonprofit organization at 11 universities across the country. USC’s branch, the largest of any other university, won the Tommy Award for Best Service Organization last year and currently is expanding to include more mentors.
Other past WYSE events included trips around Los Angeles in which mentors and mentees had the opportunity to discuss topics ranging from mental health to birth control and pregnancy.
“We give them unbiased information about anything that impacts their life as a woman in South L.A,” said WYSE executive director Lauren Estrada. “It’s more of an empowerment and confidence booster for them and helps them stay on a good path.  With more information, they empower themselves.”
Another part of the day featured two games and an activity to illustrate where the girls see themselves in the future.
Future events include a trip to the California Science Center  to see the Space Shuttle Endeavor and an IMAX movie on March 8.
“We’re getting them out of their neighborhoods to see the rest of L.A.,” said USC WYSE Outreach Director Tiffany Kuan.

The Blackstone Charitable Foundation announced this Friday that it would be expanding its campus entrepreneurship program, Blackstone LaunchPad, to the Annenberg Innovation Lab.
The foundation will also be expanded to the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of California, Irvine and the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation.
The program will pledge $3.5 million over three years to both nurture relationships between participating schools and create an entrepreneurial environment for students across all disciplines.
Over the next five years, Blackstone LaunchPad has the capability to create around 1,400 new entrepreneurial projects in California.
Many southern California officials are hopeful about the success the program will bring to their region.
“Blackstone LaunchPad fosters the talent, courage and curiosity that we value in student entrepreneurs at USC and across our partner institutions,” said Elizabeth Garrett, provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs, in a press release. “The expanded access and flexibility afforded by this program, in association with the Annenberg Innovation Lab, will provide a strong foundation for creating new ventures that enhance both our academic community and the Southern California region.”
After the program’s initial success in Michigan, it was recognized by President Barack Obama’s “Startup America” Initiative and the group vowed to extend LaunchPad to five new regions over five years. The southern California Blackstone LaunchPad project will be the final expansion of the campus entrepreneurship program after Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Montana.
All 11 campuses involved with Blackstone LaunchPad are interconnected through the program, and students are able to exchange ideas across a national organization of more than 350,000 peers and expert advisers.
Funding for the LaunchPad is part of The Blackstone Charitable Foundation’s $50 million, five-year Entrepreneurship Initiative, which aims to enable economic growth by encouraging and supporting                  up-and-coming entrepreneurs across the country.
“Through Blackstone LaunchPad, students have access to the right tools to take their ideas to market and to truly become successful entrepreneurs with their ventures rooted in California, ultimately strengthening local economies,” said Blackstone’s Chairman, CEO and      Co-Founder Stephen A. Schwarzman in a press release.
Entrepreneurial programs have been praised by government officials for being conducive to local and national economies.
“Helping entrepreneurs succeed is critical for growing our economy and creating jobs here in California and across the country,” said Xavier Becerra, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, in a press release. “The Southern California region has always been a place of great innovation and I am glad our students will have greater opportunities to unleash those next big ideas and spur local economic growth.”

On Friday, the USC Department of Public Safety alerted students to a scam that occurred repeatedly near campus.
The suspect allegedly poses as a man who has financial problems and “sells” Italian suits out of a late model silver Lincoln SUV with the license plate 7DVB186. DPS suspects other rental vehicles might have also been used.
In a statement released to the Office of International Services that will go out to international students on Tuesday, DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said that in one incident a student became suspicious and reported the scam to DPS, while another student did not purchase any suits but gave the suspect a large amount of cash.
“The Department of Public Safety urges students to be cautious when dealing with strangers,” Carlisle said in the statement. “Scams are not uncommon around college campuses.”
According to the DPS incident alert, one of the suspects is an approximately 40-year-old       dark-haired male, possibly faking an Italian accent. The suspect was seen wearing a white, long-sleeved shirt. A student who reported the incident said there was a second suspect, a Hispanic female in her 20s wearing a white tank top and seated in the passenger’s seat.
Carlisle said the suspects appear to be targeting international students.
“International students are especially vulnerable to scams as they must juggle starting college with becoming familiar with a new country and culture,” he said in the statement.
Sneha Chug, a freshman majoring in business administration, however, stressed that international students are equally as susceptible to scams as domestic students.
“I feel like we pool our students separately as international students and American students, but I actually don’t think there’s a difference based on where you’re from,” Chug said. “I just think it’s how you’ve grown up, what you’ve been surrounded by and if you’ve been aware of things like this going on.”
Chug, who is an international student from India, said she has somewhat of an advantage over other international students because she learned English shortly after learning the language of Gujarati.
“I think it definitely makes me less susceptible because the suspect is likely speaking in English and trying to convey that [he has] suits,” she said. “But even for students that have English as a second language, it’s not like all of them would have believed it and I also don’t believe that all students who have English as a first language would have just disregarded the scam.”
Peter Nordahl-Hansen, a senior from Norway majoring in critical studies, said that some international students are simply looking to meet new people and thus might be talkative.
“As an international                   student, when you are first coming here, you are trying to be more aware, you are more likely to maybe stop and talk to people because you’re not used to anything that might be part of it,” Nordahl-Hansen said. “And the language thing can be a barrier.”
As an international student, Nordahl-Hansen said he tries to be extremely diligent and do research before making large financial commitments.
“When I first came here I was more aware that I didn’t know anything, and therefore, I didn’t trust anything,” he said. “Even when I was doing car insurance and stuff like that, I would be researching more because I was unfamiliar.”
Carlisle said DPS is still searching for the suspect and it is important for students to report any information they might have.
“Don’t be afraid to report a scam if you think you might have been victimized,” Carlisle said. “You might be able to help other students avoid falling into the same situation.”
 
So, what is the scam? Does he take money and not give you the clothes? If people are dumb enough to believe sob stories and give him money, how is that different from any old panhandling?
I’m not sure if it’s the same guy but someone tried this scam on me once, but not near campus. Another popular scam is someone who walks around with a gas can saying he ran out of gas & needs money.

University response to APASS incident lacking 
On Feb. 18, the Vice Provost for Student Affairs, Dr. Ainsley Carry, released an official statement regarding the racist and misogynistic letter sent on Feb. 1 to USC Asian Pacific American Student Services, a cultural resource center within the Division of Student Affairs. His lackluster and generic statement completely fails to reflect what Asian Pacific American students were demanding prior to the release, as it only boasts USC’s international student enrollment number rather than paying appropriate attention to the imminent issues affecting the APA students. Dr. Carry’s failure to distinguish between APASS and APASA, a student assembly within the Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board, and his baffling and unnecessary inclusion of statistics on first generation and “students of Asian origin,” further confirm his lack of knowledge as the vice provost to tackle issues that have negatively impacted APA students.
Though we did not expect a detailed action plan, we had hoped to see a stronger commitment from Dr. Carry to utilize this incident as an educational tool for the entire campus, so that this type of incident does not occur again. Instead, students were presented with a shameless promotion of the school’s so–called diverse student body composition, coupled with a perplexing and frustrating display of misguided intents. We doubt any APA students’ opinions are included in the statement, and perhaps he and many others did not feel the need to take students’ ideas into account. Maybe he is right. Maybe students should not expect to check on a vice provost’s work before he releases it to the public. Or maybe we, as students, who USC exists to serve and protect, should and must demand more accountability from our school officials, regardless of their position. We are not sure whose interest the statement ultimately served, because it seems only concerned with promoting the school and the vice provost’s office for their “support” of APA students.
A majority of the readers will still fail to understand our frustration towards Dr. Carry and his statement, and such attitude is perhaps the best testament to the kind of environment USC has been fostering on minority student rights. We only need to look to last year for another example of a disappointing response from the administration to an issue that galvanized the school: the president’s brief statement regarding the Los Angeles Police Department’s abusive handling of the graduation party last May. Both the Vice Provost’s and the President’s statements are closer to temporarily pacifying Band-Aids than effective, long-term solutions (or at least firm commitments to be such). This trend is especially troublesome considering the gravity of both events and how much they affected so many students.
Most likely, this opinion piece will fail to find its way to the top school officials. But silence is worse than failed attempts, for it comforts those who attack us and breeds complacency amongst us. By remaining silent, we fail our future Trojans who rely on us to provide them with a safer and more accepting environment that they need. We can no longer afford to remain passive and indifferent to APA issues with visible consequences, and Dr. Carry must lead the effort as the vice provost for Student Affairs to propose and implement tangible changes that APA students have been demanding for so long.

I know Provost Garett had higher goals than Dr.Carey. Unfortunately our first offer said no… So we brought in a man who has no experience at this level. His time at Auburn is hardly comparable.
For all the promise and hope he brought in his first weeks, he has proven to be a shadow of the leader we need.
Thus far he refuses to meet with his own staff. He walks as a stranger in his own office suite. Student Affairs staff are jumping ship as fast as possible. USC should be concerned that he has created an environment in which people say ” Don’t work there”
Keep being the hatchet man Dr.Carey. Keep tearing apart Student Affairs from within. Your closed door attitude is very clear to the USC community.
Provost Garett.. Time to spin the wheel again. Maybe we can come up with an candidate that is worthy of our scale and scope.
All the good ones have already left…Student Affairs was decimated by the Provost and everyone decided to jump ship before it sank. Sad.
If you read the letter you can clearly see two things:
1) The sheer ridiculousness and language of the flier obviously does not reflect any part of the student body at USC.
2) It’s clearly directed at White Males and Asian Females, most likely someone who was bothered by the idea of people from these two groups dating. 
Though their are concerns about USC handling racial issues, using this letter as a platform to jump off is a bad idea.
I am a woman of Chinese descent at USC. Today while I was walking on campus, a non-Asian guy on his bike shouted “ni hao!” at me. At first I ignore him. Honestly, I wasn’t even sure that I heard him right…I just could not believe that someone at USC would be shouting ‘ni hao’ to me in that context. But when I glance at him quizzically without offering a verbal response he proceeds to shout “konichiwa!” then “ahn nyeong ha se yo!” while riding away. 
Clearly, racism and ignorance are still prevalent in our “19 percent under-represented minority” student body. If you read the flier, it is very clear that it is verbally abusive towards women and the APA community and additionally, tries to pit multiple communities against each other. It’s not just written by “someone who was bothered by the idea of … these two groups dating.” 
But, EVEN IF the flier only had to do with people from 2 groups dating (which it doesn’t), it is STILL appropriate to use it as a jumping point for talking about the way USC handles racism. As Angie and Theodore so eloquently said, “But silence is worse than failed attempts, for it comforts those who attack us and breeds complacency amongst us. By remaining silent, we fail our future Trojans who rely on us to provide them with a safer and more accepting environment that they need.” 
We need to use this opportunity to stand together and show the administration that, despite the VKC flags they boast about on every campus tour, racism and ignorance are heavily present at our university. 
Today after the guy rode away, I thought for a long time about why his comments, perhaps just passing ones to him, made me feel so bad. It’s still not something I can fully articulate just yet, but I did come to this realization: I don’t want people to *not* approach me about Chinese or Chinese American culture. I love teaching Chinese! I love sharing about my heritage and what it means to me! That’s not the problem. The problem is the context in which someone approaches cultural difference–instead of sincerely challenging to me a dialogue, he threw mis-appropriated words at me in a mocking, abusive way.
Let’s give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he wasn’t racist, he was just ignorant. Perhaps he doesn’t know the difference between appreciating cultural difference and using cultural difference as a weapon. How can Dr. Carrie’s words that “our diversity is a point of pride and strength for us, and an asset to our community” hold any meaning at all when this diversity is being utterly mistreated and approached the wrong way? Are we simply curios in a museum? 
Instead of evasive language that tries to placate, we need an administration that supports students in taking specific steps to educate the public about these issues.
I suppose if we all learn to drive, then we can talk
Good luck getting a better response from this new USC.  We have a President and Provost (mostly a Provost) and a Vice Provost who care more about image than students, who care more about the bottom line than campus culture, and who are ruining everything that USC used to be..
By the time the Trustees wake up and see what’s happening, it will be too late to salvage this great campus.
You hit the nail on the head
This is exactly why all the good faculty and staff are leaving our school, or have already left.

Imagine you’re a company owner and you’ve created a fabulous new line of toothpaste, but it’s doing terribly in stores. While Crest and Colgate fly off the shelves, your little shiny tubes remain. Then, it finally hits you: No matter how great a product is, it’s not going to matter if people don’t know about it. Enter Marketing 101.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
But marketing doesn’t only apply to corporations and toothpaste sales. Excellent marketing is necessary for the success of any idea. And though USC is a perfect example of great marketing and promotion (just think back to your first tour of the campus, your first university brochure, etc.), there are places where USC lacks in its promotional abilities. Namely, the promotion of sexual assault resources.
The Obama administration recently launched its initiative to reevaluate sexual assault policies on college campuses.
On Feb. 18, Vice President Joe Biden “chaired the first of nine ‘listening sessions’” of his White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, according to CBS News.
“I’m here to listen,” Biden said during the first session. “I want you to tell me what you think works on your campuses in your experience, what’s not working in your schools, what we should be doing that we aren’t doing, what we are doing that is not making much sense.”
 
With sexual assault at the forefront of national discussion, it’s important to evaluate how we can improve sexual assault policies on college campuses across the nation, but particularly here at USC. Though we have a plethora of incredible resources, many students might not know that these resources even exist. Sexual assault resources, specifically, remain in the most dire state.
Googling “sexual assault at USC” brings up the university’s Sexual Assault Resource Center website. The website is too simple. The current presentation of information, which is a bullet-point list of steps to take and paragraphs of overwhelming text, is unwelcoming to the user.
By random selection, I chose to look at a few other top-tier universities and their approach to sexual assault resources. I found that Duke, Stanford, UCLA and even Harvard suffered from the same, mundane presentation of facts.
But here’s the thing — topics such as consent or sex don’t have to come across as bland and boring. It only makes them even more taboo.
Emily McFadden, a columnist at the University of Washington’s campus newspaper The Daily, wrote, “Hot lines and counselors are readily available … however, the barrier that separates availability from use [is] the stigma, and oftentimes judgment, that is associated with sexual assault and abuse.”
Making information visually appealing, and properly marketing it to the student body, is a critical step in breaking such barriers.
Let’s start with the notion of revamping USC’s Sexual Assault Resource Center website. The aesthetic appeal and design of any product — whether it’s a new phone or a resource website — make it more user-friendly and less intimidating.
Furthermore, people are visual learners — it’s one of the many reasons why we are so receptive to television advertising. When we see and hear something rather than read it, we have a tendency to absorb the information more steadily. As more of our senses are engaged in the learning process, we retain the information.
As part of the Obama Administration’s endeavor to address the issue of discussing sexual assault on college campuses, the task force will sponsor eight online seminars to receive input on how to best improve these practices and policies across the nation. With the national spotlight on this serious issue, USC must take this opportunity to examine the way it addresses sexual assault. The university cannot treat the problem behind closed doors. It’s the university’s responsibility to brand sex and sexual assault in such a way that it’s no longer taboo. It’s time to bring the topic center stage.

One marketing trick is to not alienate half your customer base, something sexual assault awareness campaigns fail to do. Men are not just a tiny fraction of victims; stop ignoring them.

With last week’s films experiencing huge drops and the two new releases not making an impact, the toy-based blockbuster continued its dominance at the box office.  The LEGO Movie repeated at No. 1 with $31.3 million, a light 37 percent drop from its giant President’s Day weekend gross.  So far the film has earned a resounding $183 million total, doing well enough that Warner Bros. has already announced a sequel for Memorial Day weekend in 2017.
In second place was 3 Days To Kill, the latest thriller from Luc Besson (The Fifth Element and producer of the Transporter series and Taken) and EuropaCorp.  Starring Kevin Costner as a dying Secret Service agent on one last mission, the film earned $12.24 million, which is slightly worse than the previous Luc Besson/EuropaCorp collaboration, The Family, which opened to $14.03 million in 2013.
More so than that film, 3 Days To Kill seemed to be going for a Taken-esque vibe by casting non-action actor Kevin Costner in a father-daughter thriller.  Taken, however, was, and remains, a true lightning-in-a-bottle circumstance with an extremely clear premise and a compelling lead.  The advertisements for this film couldn’t decide if it was serious, and didn’t really clarify what was at stake (recent ads didn’t even bring up the fact that Kevin Costner’s character is dying, which is central to everything that happens in the film).
In third place was the period disaster epic Pompeii, which flopped with $10.34M.  Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (the Resident Evil movies, Alien Vs. Predator) and starring Game of Thrones’ Kit Harrington as a gladiator trying to save his life from the clutches of a corrupt senator in the midst of the historic volcanic eruption, the film seemed to have the right type of formula for a disaster film.
The most successful disaster films have to have characters the audience can care about, especially if it’s a romance at the core, with the quintessential example being Titanic.  And the story of the destruction of Pompeii has an angle of antiquity and tragedy that has appealed to filmmakers throughout the years, with previous attempts to bring it to the screen.  At one point, Roman Polanski was going to direct a Pompeii-centered film with Orlando Bloom and Scarlett Johansson.
Even with the stunning and destructive visuals of Mount Vesuvius, it almost completely overwhelmed any of the characters or any sense of plot in the marketing.  This actually marks Paul W.S. Anderson’s second historical 3-D flop, having directed 2011’s The Three Musketeers.  This film seemed to share many of the same issues marketing-wise and storyline-wise; if there’s any condolence, however, this film opened marginally better than the 2011 feature, which opened to $8.67 million and finished with $20.37 million.
Many of the other films this weekend took a huge hit. The three romances from last week (Endless Love, About Last Night and Winter’s Tale) all had drops of 67 percent or more, which is extreme in any case.  Robocop had a 54.8 percent drop to $9.8 million and will likely finish well under its fellow Verhoeven sci-fi remake, Total Recall.
Next week should be more interesting.  It’s entirely possible that The LEGO Movie could pull off a rare quadruple lead. It will be challenged by Non-Stop, the latest action thriller starring Liam Neeson, and Son of God, the cinematic edit of NBC’s record-breaking television mini-series, The Bible.  It’s also possible, however, that people might stay in Sunday to watch the Oscars.

Fandango, the premier movie ticketing service, hosted a taping of its new video series, “Frontrunners,” at the Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre last Friday. The series, which is  part of Fandango’s effort to expand beyond ticket sales and into movie discovery, features a variety of A-list talent discussing their work. Previous episodes have starred Amy Adams, Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey.
The taping, hosted by Fandango’s Chief Correspondent Dave Karger, featured the filmmakers behind the animated blockbuster Despicable Me 2: Chris Meledandri, Founder of Illumination Entertainment, screenwriter Cinco Paul and composer Heitor Pereira.
The episode began with an introduction by Sandro Corsaro, chief creative executive of Fandango. Having worked with Disney as the creator of “Kick Buttowski” and as creative director at Disney Interactive, he is one of the primary forces behind Fandango’s initiative in expanding its video content. A USC alumnus himself, Corsaro also wanted an opportunity to bring the “Frontrunners” series directly to campus.
The setup of the event was different from most panel discussions that have occurred at USC; since it was a filmed session, the stage had film lighting, grips on the side, a tracking dolly and even takes between topics. Though this made it seem a bit claustrophobic, the experience was akin to being an audience member at any other type of talk show.
After introducing the guests, the host then showed a taped intro by Steve Carell, the voice of the movies’ lead anti-villain, Gru, showing the process behind creating an animated feature, beginning with storyboarding and proceeding to animatics and an assortment of CGI-related effects. It was a good foundation for the conversation that followed, though there were issues with the audio.
After that, the panel discussed the origins of the feature, where they showed concept art for Gru and the design process behind the creation of the Minions, the mega-popular pill-shaped rascals that have contributed to the franchise, grossing more than $1.5 billion. The panelists also discussed sequences from Despicable Me 2, the appeal of the father-daughter dynamic and some ideas for the upcoming Minions spinoff.
The episode then shifted to discussing the filmmakers’ backgrounds. Meledandri recollected his experience starting out working for producers on Footloose and how he was able to take the success of the Ice Age movies, of which he produced the first two, and use it to develop new projects at Illumination. Paul mentioned his struggles and successes as a USC student in the screenwriting program, while Pereira brought up his own tumultuous journey from Brazil, including having to take a cargo ship to come to the country.
Though having it filmed could have made everything forced, the mood of the panel was always casual, informative and engaging to the audience.
“This was the most attentive audience I’ve ever seen,” Karger said.
Members of the audience also got a surprise halfway through the episode, as free Fandango tickets were planted underneath their seats. This did cause a bit of a commotion, but many attendees calmed down at the behest of the host.
The panel then opened up to questions from the audience. Audience members were encouraged to ask questions on Twitter with the hashtag #FandangoFrontrunners, though they were  also allowed to come up to a microphone to ask them in person. Most of the questions were about the animation industry, in regards to both the process of creating a screenplay and the challenges of developing an animated feature.
Meledandri said after the event that the more that people appreciate animation, the more they’ll seek out this type of public forum, especially for a medium, such as animation, that is arguably more consistent quality-wise than any other genre in the business. Cinco Paul also expressed a similar sentiment, saying that he doesn’t write a screenplay thinking it’ll be animated or for families, but as a good story that just so happens to appeal to all ages.
Corsaro sees this series as the beginning of a fruitful relationship between Fandango and USC, with plans for more Frontrunner episodes, additional video content and even internship opportunities for students. As the ticketing service develops its video content, it will also develop its relationship with the university.

It’s not every day that a 20-foot yacht sits in the desert between Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Yet putting boats in the desert, constructing miniature cities and transforming rusty cars into striking convertibles is nothing new for Abdo Hajj and Sherif Higazy.
The producers · Co-founders of Homage Arts and Production Abdo Hajj and Sherif Higazy have spent the last three years working together with a team of 30 students and friends to create music videos. – Photos courtesy of Abdo Hajj
 
For the last three years, Hajj and Higazy have created imaginative videos for musicians, artists and students. Their company, Homage Arts and Productions, also works with record labels such as Universal, Def Jam and Stealth. This impressive portfolio is a tribute to Hajj and Higazy’s persistence and dynamic, collaborative spirit.
Sherif Higazy, a senior majoring in film and television production, and Abdo Hajj, a junior majoring in narrative studies, founded Homage Arts and Productions to realize their vision of creating unique videos. Hajj described himself as “a student in transition” when he met Higazy through a mutual friend.
“[Higazy’s] work speaks for itself. You see his work and you know it’s him. He doesn’t compromise his vision,” Hajj said. “The most important thing is our dynamic — we work together well.”
The basis for Homage Arts and Productions is the idea that small budgets should not inhibit artistic vision. As Higazy explained, “most low-budget [videos] look the same. But there’s no reason a $5,000 music video can’t have an epic scene — you just have to be really creative.”
For Hajj and Higazy, this creativity involved drawing on personal connections and plenty of do-it-yourself effort. For example, the team needed a 1960s convertible for one of its earlier productions but was limited by a $2,000 budget. Instead of compromising the video’s concept, Hajj and Higazy bought and restored a junkyard-destined car.
“You can’t rely on anybody, but anytime I hit [Hajj] up [with an idea], it’s always a yes,” Higazy said. “He’ll pull it off — he doesn’t compromise and still gets it done under budget.”
Though both maintain that individual vision is important, the key is being able to cooperate and communicate in a group. Hajj and Higazy describe their productions as team efforts; their “regular crew” consists of about 30 friends and students, and Hajj credits this spirit of collaboration with the group’s success.
“If you want to be in film, the most important thing is establishing a team where everybody knows their role and respects each other’s artistic visions. No one can do it without a team,” Hajj said.
Music videos are especially demanding, requiring multiple people who must approve the initial plan. Artist’s managers, record labels and the musicians themselves are all involved in production.
Though Homage Arts and Productions’ current emphasis is music videos, the team hopes to expand and eventually produce films. Hajj and Higazy feel music videos are an ideal way to get some hands-on experience in a highly demanding environment.
“Everything is on fire and you have to get everything done — there is a pressure to get it right with developing artists,” Higazy said.
Still, they view their productions as “passion projects” rather than work. As Hajj remarks, they aim to create unexpected scenes which combine sometimes disparate elements.
This is perhaps best represented by Hajj and Higazy’s most recent music video, “F.W.D.,” which was created for up-and-coming R&B artist, Kember. The music video juxtaposes water imagery with an arid landscape — grounding a yacht in the desert sand. “F.W.D.,” is the title track off Kember’s upcoming album, Forever We Dream and the video will go live on Vimeo on Feb. 25.
“[“FWD”] is conceptually ambitious — an over-the-top production,” Higazy said.
The “over-the-top” production is emblematic of the group’s style, which is due in part to the creative freedom afforded to music video makers.
“[Music videos] are an unconventionally creative art form — you can do anything — you could go completely of the deep end or blow people’s minds,” Higazy said.
Hajj and Higazy seem to be doing more of the latter; their music videos are a refreshing departure from the rehashed party scenes that tend to dominate music videos. The pair tends toward weaving narratives into the fabric of their productions — but with hard work and a never-say-die attitude, Higazy and Hajj seem to be producing a creative future for themselves, as well.
