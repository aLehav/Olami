The USC International Genetically Engineered Machine team recently had its project sing its way to an award at the iGEM 2012 Americas West Jamboree hosted at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif.
In the project, titled E. Musici, the team stimulated E. coli bacteria with different environmental conditions to move its  flagella (whip-like tails) at a rate that translated into an audible frequency. The rate of flagella movement corresponds with the bacteria’s level of distress, which gave the bacteria the ability to respond to the scientists’ stimulation.
These sound waves created “music.” The team even created a music video that can be viewed on the iGEM website.
The team is composed of undergraduate students Megan Bernstein, Rachel Kohan, Ellen Park, Stephen Genyk, Eric Siryj, Luke Quinto, Kevin Le and Rebecca Gao. The students are studying a variety of different subjects related to biology, from biomedical engineering to biological sciences. Percy Genyk of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering served as a graduate student advisor, and Professor Sean Curran of the USC Davis School of Gerontology and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences served as faculty advisor for the team.
“iGEM is basically an undergraduate synthetic biology team,” Bernstein, a junior majoring in biological sciences, said.
Percy Genyk said he decided to become an advisor to continue participating in iGEM in a different role.
“The year before I was part of the team and so I figured, especially since the team only had one veteran, it would be a great idea if I would step in as an advisor and show them all the ropes,” Genyk said.
The idea of having bacteria make music came about during a brainstorming session when students were encouraged to suggest any crazy but cool topics they thought up.
“As exciting as a project can be, it also has to be feasible,” Genyk said. “At first I didn’t know how they were going to do it, but they did it.”
Bernstein admitted that translating this idea into action wasn’t always easy.
“It took us a really long time in order to get these functioning parts, but we kind of pulled through in the last month and a half,” she said.
Colleges from all around the western United States, including Harvey Mudd College, University of Texas Austin, Colorado State, Colorado University Boulder, Arizona State, UC Davis and UC Berkeley, attended the competition. The event had two types of awards. The USC team won a gold medal, indicating that they achieved certain benchmarks specified in the judging criteria. These include creating a new BioBrick and improving the function of an additional BioBrick, helping another team and discussing a new approach to synthetic biology.
Bernstein believes that the team’s research can be useful to scientists in the future, as bacteria’s frequencies are based off of how they respond to their environment.
“If a researcher knows the type of bacteria they are using and they want to know if it’s happy, they can know the different frequencies,” Bernstein said.

Hardcore video game enthusiasts and curious Annenberg students gathered in Annenberg Auditorium on Monday night to listen to experts  discuss what it takes to succeed in the modern video game industry.
Geek chic · Chris Metzen of World of Warcraft (left) and Flint Dille of Diablo III discuss their careers in video game developing Monday. – Mndy Curtis | Daily Trojan
The conversation featured Chris Metzen of World of Warcraft and Starcraft II and Flint Dille of Diablo III and Transformers.
The evening began with a look back at Metzen and Dille’s early careers and how they first developed a passion for games. Though their paths to their current careers differed, Metzen and Dille agreed that it was Dungeons & Dragons, the fantasy role-playing game released in 1974 that provided the initial spark of interest that all artists thrive on.
“From fifth grade to around the time I jumped in at Blizzard, my friends and I had an ongoing D&D campaign,” Dille said. “It was the track of our youth.”
When pressed on what made the game so special, Metzen and Dille cited its open-ended nature.
“Rules are there to facilitate what you want to do, but everything resided in the realm of your imagination … it was the organic component of sitting at a table with your friends and making it up as you went along … that made it so special and unpredictable,” Metzen said.
Dille said the experience of playing the game became a phenomenon.
“Nobody ever made a game where it’s all in your imagination,” Dille said.
What began as simply having fun with friends ended up becoming an important source of inspiration in Metzen’s and Dille’s professional careers.
“That D&D spirit — that feeling that D&D gave us as younger gamers — was something that we’ve always been chasing, that we’ve always wanted to feel again,” Metzen said.
Dille agreed with Metzen’s sentiment.
“You spend your whole creative career chasing stuff that excited you as a kid … you have certain interests and they never go away,” Metzen said.
Dille and Metzen, however, were quick to point out that passion alone does not translate to career success, especially in today’s competitive gaming industry.
Developing specialized skills while in school could be key for students hoping to get into the gaming industry, Metzen said.
“These days, the industry moves so fast and the arc of technology goes up so fast and so high that we are looking for real specialized skill sets,” Metzen said.
In the long run, however, succeeding in the video game industry is no different from succeeding in any other field. It takes networking skills, hard work and a sense of identity.
“Managers are hiring people to join a team, a family. That sense of chemistry and who you are is important,” Metzen said. “Just be really clear on who you are. … Be specific about what geeks you up.”
As competitive and as high-octane as today’s industry is, newcomers actually have it easier, according to Dille.
“You guys have a huge advantage. In the old days, there were seven studios and they controlled all the cameras,” Dille said. “Now if your content’s good enough, you can make stuff with your iPhone. You can put it on YouTube and Machinima.”
Ali Timnak, a first-year graduate student studying game development and intelligent robotics, initially came to the event to listen to Metzen speak about his work on World of Warcraft. From the event, he took away career advice that he believes will be useful after he graduates.
“I learned how to present myself to managers and employers on my portfolio,” Timnak said.
When asked if he would recommend similar events in the future to his friends, Timnak did not hesitate.
“Yes, definitely,” Timnak said. “I just came here to take away anything useful I could get, and I learned a lot.”

An exhibit featuring the retired space shuttle Endeavour will be available for public viewing Tuesday at the California Science Center in Exposition Park, adjacent to the University Park Campus.
On display · Endeavour rests in a temporary hangar before being moved into the Samuel Oschin Space Shuttle Endeavour Display Pavilion for its debut at the museum on Tuesday. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Gov. Jerry Brown is expected to speak at the opening at 10 a.m. Science Center President Jeffrey Rudolph said he hopes the exhibit will help boost interest in the shuttle.
“Obviously people were excited just to see it fly over or even [get] a closer look when they could see it going down the streets, but here they get a lot more of a chance to see it,” Science Center President and CEO Jeffrey Rudolph said to the Los Angeles Times. “People can learn a lot more about it.”
Endeavour, the fifth and final NASA shuttle to be engineered, first flew in May 1992; its last mission, a trip to the international space station, was in May 2011.
Rudolph anticipates the new shuttle exhibition to raise attendance to 2 million people per year from 1.5 million, according to the Los Angeles Times.
All the money for the construction of the Air and Space Center, Endeavour’s future home, has come from donations and fundraising; the center expects no state general funding support.
The shuttle is currently being held in the Samuel Oschin Space Shuttle Endeavour Display Pavilion while its permanent home is being built. In the pavilion, the museum is also displaying SPACEHAB, a capsule that provided astronauts with additional space, along with a main engine, built by Rocketdyne in Canoga Park in the San Fernando Valley.
Before visiting the shuttle display, museum guests will visit the accompanying exhibit “Endeavour: The California Story.” This exhibit will feature a shuttle galley, lavatory and tires.
The museum has launched a $200 million campaign to fund temporary and permanent displays, 80 percent of which is for the permanent air and space wing, Rudolph told the Times.
The display requires a non-refundable ticket, which are available in person on a first-come, first-served basis and online, for a specific time to view the shuttle.

Long time professor and classical violinist Alice Schoenfeld donated $3 million to fund a new symphonic hall, the USC Thornton School of Music announced Monday.
The 3,700-square-foot symphonic hall will be named after Schoenfeld and her late sister, Eleonore. Previously used by the USC School of Cinematic Arts, the hall was refurbished this summer. It now has complete audio and video recording capabilities, lighting and suspended flooring for sound isolation and flexible acoustic design. This new design will better accommodate larger performing groups, such as the symphony and wind ensembles.
Dean of the USC Thornton School of Music, Robert Cutietta, emphasized the importance of a new symphonic hall.
“It’s time the USC Thornton Symphony and Wind Ensemble have a custom designed space where they can rehearse,” Cutietta said in a press release. “These two ensembles are recognized as among the best collegiate groups in the country, and it is essential that we have a dedicated orchestral rehearsal hall.”
The USC Thornton School has one of the strongest strings departments in the country, along with being consistently ranked among the finest conservatories and international music schools.
The dedication of the hall occurred Sunday and included performances from Schoenfeld’s former students. The dedication was followed by an open house and student concert on Monday.
Schoenfeld, the holder of the Alice and Eleonore Schoenfeld Endowed Chair in String Instruction, has been teaching violin instruction and performance at Thornton for more than half a century. She remains active with classical music instruction with students and additionally practices between two and four hours each day.
The Schoenfeld sisters comprised the Schoenfeld Duo and were internationally acclaimed classical performers who toured music halls around the world.
Before her death in 2007, Eleonore Schoenfeld was also a professor at USC Thornton and the holder of the Gregor Piatigorsky Chair in Violoncello.
Schoenfeld wanted to contribute to Thornton because of her and her sister’s dedication to the school and its program.
“I thought I’d leave a legacy,” Schoenfeld said in a statement. “I’d like to perpetuate the name of my sister, as she was very active here for so long.”
USC President C. L. Max Nikias recognized the Schoenfelds’ influence at the university and abroad.
“Through their dedication as teachers, and their generosity as philanthropists, they have nurtured some of the greatest musicians in the world, while creating an extraordinary legacy for themselves and for USC Thornton,” Nikias said in a press release.
The donation from Schoenfeld aligns with the goals for the Campaign for the University of Southern California, an initiative to raise at least $6 billion from private donations, foundations and corporations that will grow the university’s endowment and extend its influence in the world. The university plans to use $1 billion toward capital projects.
Earlier this month, another donor contributed money to benefit the USC Marshall School.

I’m sorry, really.
We at the Daily Trojan — the editors, the writers, the columnists — along with seemingly every other media outlet and the rest of the country bought into USC’s hype this season.
Coming up empty · Senior quarterback Matt Barkley has completed 10 percent fewer passes in the second half of games than in the first half. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
We got sucked up into everything, the whirlwind of the offseason, with the free agent-like addition of running back Silas Redd.
We couldn’t stop talking and writing about returning starters for the nation’s preseason No. 1 team.
This newspaper’s first issue in mid-August highlighted the fact that the Trojans were prepared to leave lasting legacies. One of the first football-related stories of the semester discussed how the offense “harkened back” to that of the 2005 team.
And on several occasions over the last week, yours truly highlighted what now seem like far-reaching, if not impossible, possibilities: USC playing for a BCS national title and Matt Barkley earning a trip to New York City as a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, given to the most outstanding player in college football.
For us as students, it’s hard to separate fandom from objectivity. Most of us have at least one cardinal-and-gold T-shirt tucked in our dresser drawer.
We can recite the SoCal spellout with the best of ’em and we’ve wolfed down 2:30 a.m. Chanos. (Three weeks later, I think I can still feel it).
But we also hold ourselves to a higher measuring stick, so to speak, because of that second part in our titles: student journalists.
And it’s our job to adhere to that second part.
We’re expected to ask questions that probe, not pamper. We’re supposed to scrutinize, to point out the things that don’t look quite right. We’re instructed to analyze critically, not promote. More than anything, we’re told to be honest and fair.
As I watched the unraveling of USC’s season last Saturday in Tucson — a 39-36 loss at the hands of Arizona — I couldn’t help but wonder if we missed something over the last couple weeks.
Did we forget about the issues regarding depth and scholarship limitations? In the fourth quarter, the Trojans’ 75 looked gassed. Certainly they weren’t better than the Wildcats’ 85.
Did we neglect to highlight Barkley’s issues with interceptions? The right-handed senior quarterback has now thrown an interception in five of the Trojans’ eight games this season, already surpassing 2011’s total of seven.
Did we overlook youth on the offensive line? For the first time in school history, a freshman started at left tackle for USC, versus Arizona, and sophomore Aundrey Walker, though not suiting up against the Wildcats, has suffered his fair share of growing pains. It’s a far cry from Matt Kalil protecting Barkley’s blind side.
Did we take assistant head coach Monte Kiffin at his word that the defense would simply get better with time and experience? No matter how experienced, they still gave up 588 yards of total offense to Arizona.
Did we fail to ask whether USC coach Lane Kiffin was functional in playing two different roles: head coach andde facto offensive coordinator? Could he instill discipline as the head of the program while concentrating on his offensive game plan? It didn’t look like it Saturday. The Trojans were penalized 13 times for 117 yards and committed five turnovers, while Kiffin was drawing up reverses on fourth-and-two.
Maybe we didn’t give these things enough scrutiny.
Maybe we assumed that a 10-2 finish last fall would of course serve as a springboard for this season.
Maybe we assumed “USC was still USC,” to steal a line from Lane.
But it’s our job to accurately dissect this team as writers and editors making up your student newspaper.
We’re asked to separate fact from fiction and truth from spin.
That’s the media’s role, more or less, to serve as a watchdog for the program.
And could we have done better?
Six of our seven sports columnists, the ones who partake in the weekly “Best Bets,” predicted at the onset of the season that USC would in fact win a BCS national championship, keeping in line with the Associated Press poll, which also had the team at No. 1.
Boy, does that seem like a long time ago.
Whatever USC’s hang-up was, we missed it this preseason, because as is rather evident now: The Trojans clearly aren’t who we thought they were.

Thekatman, you are so out of sync regarding politics which has no place in this article. You are lame  just like
Romney and Ryan. Obama took over with sanctions left from the Bush Administration and has the country moving in the right direction whether fast enough or not. Reverting to the Republican policies of old is a giant step backwards.
Glad your dumb-ass vote will be wasted while California goes big time for Obama in this election.
So you’re saying the United States can’t fix its issues like a football program would by replacing the “head coach,” mixing up the starting lineup or bringing on more 5* scholarship players? You dummy, brainwashed leftists never learn!!!
Your article cleariy spells out the iaaues our team is facing… And actually you are more on point with the current issues in our presidential election as well.
The country was sold an outlandish bill of goods in 2008 based on Hope and Change and have been deceived by the main stream media into believing Obama was going to be great.  The opposite has haooened. USC loses out on its oppty to go to the BCS Natty and Obama, hopefully, loses out on a 2nd term, for the good of the country.
We all know that USC’s football progam can rebound back, but it won’t happen this year. Too many mistakes, too much arrogance…from Te Obama Admin and CLK.

It was only one week ago that USC still entertained a reasonable chance of eking into the national title picture by winning primetime matchups against  top-five teams in Oregon and Notre Dame.
Now No. 17 in the BCS, USC must recalibrate its sights on a less lofty — but necessary — objective: winning the Pac-12 South division.
Claiming the Pac-12 South title would allow USC to play in the Pac-12 championship game against the North division winner. A victory in that game would vault USC into the Rose Bowl if it finished at least No. 14 in the BCS standings.
But based on the way the Trojans unraveled at Arizona, and Oregon’s pending visit Saturday, perhaps it’s wise not to put the cart too far ahead of the horse.
Currently, USC stands in a three-way tie with UCLA and Arizona State in the Pac-12 South for fewest conference losses with two. Obviously, the most definite path for USC to ensure a Pac-12 title game berth is to win the remainder of its conference slate.
Yet, even if USC loses to Oregon this weekend and wins the rest of its matchups, it can ensure itself of finishing ahead of UCLA and Arizona State by virtue of winning its head-to-head matchups — the ultimate tiebreaker if teams finish with the same Pac-12 record.
Suffering their third Pac-12 loss to Oregon, however, does open the Trojans up to competition from Arizona, which has currently posted three conference losses to Stanford, Oregon State and Oregon.
But the Wildcats must still face UCLA — in Pasadena this Saturday — and Arizona State to finish the season in the Territorial Cup, meaning they are by no means assured of winning the remainder of their games — especially if star quarterback Matt Scott misses time because of a concussion he suffered against USC.
Despite the loss to Arizona, USC sits in a surprisingly comfortable position atop the Pac-12 South that effectively just requires the Trojans to beat Arizona State and UCLA and hope for the Wildcats to slip up in one of their four remaining games.
The Trojans, a supposed mortal lock for the Pac-12 title game entering 2012, will now have to do some Pac-12 scoreboard-watching with Arizona.
Winning the Pac-12 South is no longer the effective fait accompli it was before last Saturday, but the Trojans still control their own destiny and can likely still make it to the Pac-12 title game even with a loss against Oregon.

Perhaps it’s easiest to digest Saturday’s 36-39 loss at Arizona as a game of “runs,” or segments of time in which one team dominated play. Arizona jumped out in front with a 10-0 lead, USC stormed back to score 28 of the game’s next 31 points and the Wildcats responded with 26 unanswered points before USC’s unsuccessful comeback attempt.

During his Sunday conference call with the media, USC coach Lane Kiffin lamented his team’s uneven play.
“There were so many ways to win the game,” Kiffin said. “Obviously, with less penalties and less turnovers.”
Reiterating his stance in the immediate aftermath of the game, Kiffin did not blame lack of preparation or desire to win.
“We do the hard things — they practice very hard, they prepare really well,” Kiffin said. “The easy things are the decision-making on the penalties. It definitely cost us again.”
When pressed to offer an explanation for USC’s string of underwhelming second-half performances, Kiffin could only credit Arizona’s coaching staff.
“They coach and they have players on scholarship, too,” Kiffin said. “Every drive is not going to go for 80 yards. You’re going to have some series where you don’t score and have to punt the ball. You just don’t want to turn it over.”
—
Two particular plays stuck out during the course of the game: an overthrown pass to junior wide receiver Robert Woods that appeared ticketed for a touchdown when the cornerback covering Woods tripped, and a first-quarter pass interference penalty on sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee that the referees later rescinded.
The missed connection to Woods was a play senior quarterback Matt Barkley scripted after he noticed the cornerback had been playing Woods too aggressively earlier in the game.
“We put a double move on their corner, who jumped the post route earlier,” Kiffin said. “We weren’t able to connect on it, but Robert would have been able to walk into the end zone.”
At the time, USC was up by 15 points in the third quarter, and a touchdown strike might have staked the Trojans to an insurmountable 22-point lead.
Lee’s phantom pass interference penalty occurred in the first quarter, when Barkley threw a pass into the end zone that the stellar wideout was unable to snare because an Arizona cornerback draped an arm on his shoulder.
Two penalty flags were thrown on the play, and USC anticipated earning the 15-yard penalty. Unfortunately for the Trojans, the call was overruled by another official.
“Two different officials threw flags,” Kiffin said. “They said that one of the officials came in and said he was grabbing Marqise, but he did not twist Marqise, therefore he overruled the two other officials.”
The referee’s explanation didn’t satisfy Kiffin, but he refused to comment further.
“I’m not going to comment on that anymore for obvious reasons,” Kiffin said.
Pac-12 rules forbid coaches from criticizing officiating.
—
Many also scrutinized Kiffin’s refusal to spike the ball during USC’s last offensive series in order to stop the clock. With less than a minute remaining in the game and no timeouts left, USC ran just five plays.
Kiffin based his decision on the flow of the game and the fact that USC picked up first downs on its first three plays in the final series. Since the clock stops after each first down as officials move the chains and resumes when the ball’s placed, Kiffin reasoned that, so long as the Trojans snapped the ball immediately after it was placed, not much time would elapse before running the next play.
“Normally, in the two-minute drill, you’re at a point where you’re not making first downs,” Kiffin said. “We had three straight plays where we made first downs. If you can get lined up, you wind up really not wasting any time.”
If given the opportunity to replay the last offensive series, however, Kiffin admitted that he might have clocked the ball after the third play.
“In slow motion, after a lot of time, I would’ve done everything the same until the second-to-last play,” Kiffin said. “We called a double-move to Marqise off of the same play we had just run. I would’ve clocked that one if we could do it again — and that’s not because of the time saved, that’s really more about giving Marqise a rest because he had just run a couple of plays in a row and was obviously a little bit winded.”
When asked whether Barkley had any input into clocking the ball, Kiffin affirmed that it’s the coach’s duty to make such decisions.
“No, that’s all on me,” Kiffin said. “I don’t know if a coach has ever given the quarterback the ability to do that. Because the quarterback has a lot of people chasing him around, he really doesn’t have a good idea of the time situation.”
—
Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez — a lightning rod for controversy in the past — came under fire following the game for allowing quarterback Matt Scott to complete a fourth-quarter offensive series during which he suffered a vicious hit to the head on an eight-yard scramble that placed the ball at USC’s nine-yard line with 7:13 remaining.
Scott was later seen vomiting on Arizona’s sidelines, a common symptom of a concussion in which a player’s inner ear — responsible for balance — is shaken.
The dual-threat quarterback somehow side-stepped a thorough examination on the sideline following the hit, even though Arizona took a timeout. Scott returned to the field and finished the final three plays of the scoring drive, which gave Arizona an 11-point lead.
Scott was unavailable to the media following the game, and various media outlets are already speculating that he might not play at UCLA on Saturday.
It has yet to be determined what the NCAA’s response will be to Rodriguez’s decision to keep Scott in for the duration of that series.
I can explain it: Lane and Monty Kiffin aren’t very good coaches and need to go.  There, that wasn’t so hard.

People equate Halloween with horror, and these days that sadly means a not-so-fresh batch of found-footage sequels or lackluster horror films all made with the same gray filter. It’s a shame, because there is nothing better to do on Halloween than get some candy and sit down for a horror movie marathon.
In honor of the most sinister holiday, here are some of the best films and television episodes for Halloween. They might not seem like the obvious choices, but they’re thrilling and much better than many current Hollywood offerings.
 
Boris Karloff’s Frankenstein trilogy
In the 1930s and 1940s, Universal was the king of horror, in part because it adapted classic monsters from myth and literature. One of its most iconic series was its take on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. The series lasted for many more films, but the first three feature Boris Karloff’s archetypical performance as the Creature.
Frankenstein sees Colin Clive’s titular Doctor Henry Frankenstein embark on a maddened quest to create life. His creative energy leads to a violent creature set loose on the countryside. In the sequel, Bride of Frankenstein, the doctor has to deal with the consequences of his creation as others try to exploit Frankenstein’s talents for their own gain. It’s a strong character arc that actually lets the characters grow.
The story culminates in Son of Frankenstein, where the doctor’s son, Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone), has to deal with his family’s legacy in a country that doesn’t trust him.
Scary, haunting and surprisingly character-driven, these three films are not the most accurate take on Shelley’s novel, but they form a powerful trilogy telling one strong story.
 
Franklyn
Franklyn is an odd film. It’s not an outright horror film, nor does it really have anything to do with Halloween. But Gerald McMorrow’s debut feature is a dark, psychological masterpiece perfect for the holiday.
The film follows four people who are lost in life. In a very bleak London setting, a young man (Sam Riley) finds himself left at the altar, a depressed woman (Eva Green) decides to turn her suicide attempts into art projects and a father searches for his missing son. And in a twisted, steampunk-esque world called Meanwhile City — where the one rule is that everyone must have a faith, no matter what it is — atheist and vigilante Preest (Ryan Phillippe) investigates a mysterious cult called Duplex Ride.
Franklyn is a dark study on isolation and despair. Meanwhile City is a fully realized world out of some kind of nightmare, while modern London seems equally sinister. Each performance is amazing, and the four narratives come together an unpredictable, fascinating way.
 
The Crow
Not all Halloween films are outright scary. Sometimes a film works more with a mood, and can involve elements outside of the horror genre to bring in a larger audience. One of the best examples of this is Alex Proyas’ The Crow. The plot is straightforward, but compelling: a couple is murdered the night before their Halloween wedding, and the would-be groom (Brandon Lee) rises from the grave a year later to hunt down those responsible.
There’s something in The Crow for everyone. It’s a slasher film, except the killer is the good guy and a complex character to boot. It’s also one of the bleakest takes on urban crime in recent memory and surprisingly one of the best romance films in the last two decades, even with its tragic start. It’s even something of a superhero film.
It comes together in a dark, modern Gothic film anchored by Lee’s haunting, final performance (Lee died in an accident on set). For films set on Halloween, ignore the Halloween series and go with The Crow.
 
The Wolfman (2010)
Universal’s films from Hollywood’s Golden Age are iconic, and Lon Chaney Jr.’s tortured Wolf Man is one of the most famous. There is good reason for it — in a relatively short run time, director George Waggner and his cast dealt with romance, horror and a complex father-son relationship between Chaney Jr. and Claude Rains. Its brilliance is topped only by its 2010 remake.
Returning home after the death of his brother, Lawrence Talbot (Benecio Del Toro) is forced to reconnect with his estranged father (Anthony Hopkins). Things are soon interrupted, however, when a large wolf attacks, and Lawrence finds himself cursed to become a werewolf.
The cast is excellent, and the plot is one of the smartest in recent memory with a strong psychological-thriller bent. Director Joe Johnston brings a classic horror tone to the film — atmosphere and suspense was emphasized over gore and cheap surprises — and it really worked. And then there’s the makeup: Instead of the truly bad CGI werewolves from Harry Potter or Twilight, The Wolfman puts Del Toro in practical effects to create a terrifying and iconic monster.
 
Boy Meets World, “And Then There Was Shawn”
Boy Meets World is one of the quintessential ’90s television shows. It was funny, had heart and followed a relatable group of people from middle school through college. The show dealt with many issues facing teenagers and put a heavy emphasis on its characters and their relationships.
And then there was that episode where a killer trapped the cast in a school and started picking them off.
“And Then There Was Shawn” works both as a comedy and a horror story. It expertly deconstructs and parodies slasher films, and offers genuine scares at the same time. And Jennifer Love Hewitt even shows up in a random appearance that creates some wonderful jokes.
Part of why “And Then There Was Shawn” works is that the episode is truly unpredictable. Even with jokes about who is likely to die, the deaths are unexpected and the killer shows up at unexpected times to wreak havoc. For a teenage drama, this is a thrilling installment.
 
The Twilight Zone, “The Howling Man”
The Twilight Zone is the classic speculative fiction show. It tested morality, thrived off uncertainty and paranoia and used the audience’s imagination against it. “The Howling Man” is the show’s horror side at its finest.
Seeking shelter from a storm, a man arrives at a monastery. The monks let him in, but warn that he must stay away from a prisoner said to be demonic. But the prisoner says that he’s being held captive by a crazed, murderous cult. Who’s telling the truth, and what answer is the most frightening?
The show does so much with so little. Charles Beaumont’s script doesn’t rely on big scares or effects, instead playing with both its protagonist and the audience and testing them to see who they believe: the prisoner or the monks. Does superstition or mistrust of humanity win out? It’s a tale that can only be found in … The Twilight Zone.

As the day slowly begins, an eye-catching red, white and black bus comes to a lurching halt at a stop right across from the University Village.
Billboard broadcast · Artist Barbara Kruger forces viewers to consider controversial topics like funding for the arts by bringing her artwork into the public sphere. In addition to arranging her moving artwork on the sides of buses, Kruger voices her concerns with blatant billboard messages. – Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
If you noticed this bus, you actually noticed the work of a veritable artist, albeit on quite an unusual canvas. The careful placement of words and choice of colors comes from the artistic mind and passionate attitude of artist Barbara Kruger, a figure who consistently looks to speak through art as loudly as possible.
Kruger made a name for herself with a recognizable font and color palette, and her works sometimes include images but always rely on the power of words. Though the artist has held indoor shows everywhere from L&M Arts to LACMA, her work breaks into the public space through centers like train stations and parks.
In these outdoor settings, Kruger’s bold statements ring out the loudest. From the beginning, the artist tackled issues like the female image and American consumerism in a manner that shocked and intrigued the many viewers that came across her work. The buses now driving around the city as moving canvases come as part of an initiative called “Art Matters.” which strives to increase economic support for arts programs for the Los Angeles Unified School District. For the month of October, LAUSD called upon Kruger’s talent to spread the word about the need for this funding.
The bus comes with artworks that also cover billboards ensuring that the message comes across one way or another. The bus proves a gutsy and bold way to get across LAUSD’s concerns. The bus automatically stands out from the rest of its normal compatriots and becomes a flurry of words that speeds by you when you least expect it. Kruger chooses characteristically hard-hitting and thought-provoking phrases, such as, “Human history becomes more a race between education and catastrophe,” and, “Art is as heavy as, as light as a breeze, as bright as an idea, as pretty as a picture, as funny as money and as fugitive as fraud.”
“The place of the arts in the classroom is essential in encouraging invention, ambition, and an understanding of the importance and pleasures of living an examined life,” stated Kruger, a UCLA professor, in Juxtapoz magazine.
The fact that Kruger can take something as simple and mundane as a public bus and turn it into art blatantly showcases the impact that art can make on everyday spaces. Furthermore, that bus serves as an important testament to a belief that she and LAUSD share: that the bus becomes a vehicle for a broadcasting a message loudly and clearly, in a way that art can do when it breaks out into the public sphere.
Kruger’s billboards carry that idea further, ripping away consumerist images viewers expect and giving food for thought instead. The work does not let the viewer simply stand back and think, “Oh, that’s pretty.” Her work forces the viewer to react, whether it is in agreement or disagreement, approval or disapproval. That factor alone probably prompted LAUSD to work with the artist — when Kruger wants to say something, she makes sure her viewers hear the message.
But Kruger’s work also includes some humorous tidbits. One very small section of a piece simply quips, “Don’t be such a jerk,” while another longer phrase advises, “Give your brain as much attention as your hair and you’ll be a thousand times better off.” That’s Kruger’s snarkiness unleashed, and it serves as a reminder that the artist does not just serve the purpose of messenger. She might communicate the ideas LAUSD wants her to express, but she will also do so with her own twist.
Ultimately, that’s the biggest lesson learned from this mobile piece of art and the accompanying billboard. Kruger’s art seems to be saying, “If we don’t support arts programs in schools, we might never find out the kinds of work that students can produce.” Here, art can serve as more than aesthetically pleasing eye candy; it can help society reassess its situation both on a societal scale and a personal one.
Whether or not the viewer agrees with Kruger’s message, one thing remains clear: If we focus on teaching children about art, it’s not with the intent of just encouraging them to make pretty pictures. LAUSD believes in the power of Kruger’s work just as they believe in the power of art when in the hands of budding, intelligent students.
Kruger previously worked on a similar project — an 18-wheeler with a political message plastered on its side — under the “America: Now and Here” exhibition. That moving vehicle emphasized the impact of violence on society in the same way the buses focus on arts education. That Kruger can use her signature look for any issue in any location once again proves her importance and impact as an artist. The Kruger-tweaked buses might not travel for much longer, but thankfully, she’ll continue to use her talent to make an impact, no matter what form it takes.

After a summer of renovations, USC’s newly refurbished and restocked cafeterias opened to the public this fall to mixed reviews.
Piling it on · Some students struggle to find enough food at USC’s cafeterias during heavy lunch and dinner hours. As a result, fitting in a quick meal between classes might involve throwing together whatever is available. – Devra Traiman | Daily Trojan
Whereas most students started off the year generally pleased with the newly revamped and polished cafeterias (particularly EVK Restaurant and Grill, which unveiled a fancy Mongolian grill and additional serving stations), their opinions these days vary. Though some students said they are perfectly content with their dining experience, others complained about everything from a lack of food options to sanitation issues.
“After hearing that the cafeterias were getting renovated before we got to school, I was really excited to eat there,” said Dylan Abrams, a freshman majoring in psychology. “It was pretty good the first week, and then it deteriorated. What happened to the fancy tablecloths and the gourmet food? Now I’m just disappointed.”
Those who are happy with the USC cafeterias, however, offer multiple complimentary statements about them.
“I love eating [at EVK and Parkside],” said Jason Aftalion, a freshman studying business administration. “I think they have a lot to offer.”
Deborah Halimi, a freshman majoring in business administration, added: “The outdoor grill [at EVK] is fantastic.  I love the turkey burgers and grilled chicken.”
On the opposite end of the spectrum, however, those who are dissatisfied with their dining experience insist that they are not presented with quite enough variety.
“I wish we had more choices. The same, unappealing dishes get repeated every few days,” Abrams said. “I’ve started to just eat cereal for dinner because I don’t want to eat the same thing every day.”
Additional complaints from those who are unhappy include slow restocking at EVK; food often runs out during busy dining hours, leaving students with even fewer meal choices. This might lead to a lot of frustration, especially for those who intend to fit in a quick meal before classes and have to wait long periods of time for the food to be restocked.
But one of the more prevalent complaints students have revolves around unclean dishes; many students have started to notice food remnants and dried sauces stuck to the plates they pick up in line. Not only do some students find this inconvenient, they are also somewhat dismayed by the cafeteria’s lack of cleanliness: People are constantly thumbing through the stacked dishes trying to find a clean plate, which doesn’t make for the most appetizing meal.
“It’s really off-putting to come in and find pieces of food still stuck to the plates,” said Dylan Abrams, a freshman majoring in psychology.
But these issues are not unique to EVK. The recently converted Café 84 and Parkside Restaurant have also have not been quite up to par, according to some students.
“After hearing that Parkside was the superior option, I went there with high hopes,” said Asher Levy, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “I left with a stomach ache after downing sopping, saccharine Chinese noodles and pesto pasta so drenched in [cream].”
Such complaints come as a surprise to Kris Klinger, Director of USC Hospitality.
“The residential team worked extremely hard this summer preparing the venues for the students,” Klinger said. “Along with the updated new spaces, we introduced brand new menus and recipes.”
Additionally, Klinger states that USC Hospitality has been working with  Michelle Dong, the Vice President of Advocacy for the University Residential  Student Community, on garnering student feedback and responses, most of which have been positive. Most feedback includes responses that students are happy with the food, that staying open until 10 p.m. is appreciated and works well for all and that people would like to see Café 84 open during the weekend. Other suggestions involve allowing students to take food outside of the dining hall and offering more of a variety of food options.
Klinger and the rest of the hospitality team, however, are cognizant of the fact that some students are still unhappy and have made a concerted effort to fix that.
“We have asked our dietitian, Lindsey Pine, to set up a new survey in EVK, Café 84 and Parkside Restaurant starting next week in order to solicit more feedback,” he said. “We are also working on setting up our first recipes committee meeting of the year. Now that we have enough students interested we will be able to start next month. We traditionally meet once a month.”
These are not the only steps USC Hospitality is taking to improve things for student diners. A greater effort is being made to work specifically with the cafeteria chefs, as well.
“Our executive Chef Eric Ernest is working with our chefs on quality, recipes and updating our menus,” Klinger said. “We will launch new menus in the spring and take all of the feedback we are getting into consideration and incorporate all the suggestions we can.”
In order to help USC Hospitality enhance the on-campus dining experience, students are encouraged to utilize the comment card boxes in the dorms set up by the University Residential  Student Community or to reach out to Student Government or USC Hospitality representatives.
“We understand there are improvements we can make and are open to any suggestions, comments and feedback,” Klinger said.
Pesto sauce doesn’t have cream in it…
“I’ve started to just eat cereal for dinner because I don’t want to eat the same thing every day.”
Huh?

Despite the fact that it was written 106 years ago, The Doctor’s Dilemma is, in many ways, an immensely modern play. It deals with complex themes and relationships, but at the same time is enjoyable because of its wit and grandiose characters. Like the typical George Bernard Shaw work, The Doctor’s Dilemma is a fun and quotable comedy as well as a deep meditation on morality and human nature.

Director Dámaso Rodriguez’s interpretation of The Doctor’s Dilemma remains fairly traditional, which is the exact approach the material needs. This is partially because the play is about myriad issues that arose in technology and medicine when Shaw was writing in the early 20th century. The focus of the play shifts suddenly at the end of the first act, however, as the play fixates more on the moral dilemma the characters will wrestle with throughout the rest of the play: Is the life of a great artist or that of a decent man’s more valuable,  and is it even a doctor’s place to judge such things?
The Doctor’s Dilemma follows each member of a group of doctors as they seek to answer these questions. Each character comes with his own peculiarities, and each represents a very specific way of thinking. For this reason, the play succeeds because of the actors’ portrayals of these characters; almost every actor is compelling and hilarious and contributes, therefore, to the play’s success.
Sir Colenso Ridgeon (Geoff Elliott), the central figure of the play, is the most logical, intelligent and talented of the doctors — or at least, that’s how he seems at first. The play slowly reveals, however, that Ridgeon is a much more selfish man than he initially appears. Elliott is extremely believable in the role and is interestingly able to develop his character without ever outwardly appearing any different or seeming any less rational.
The other doctors represent very specific points of view. Apollo Dukakis portrays the old and cynical — but wise — Sir Patrick Cullen,  who is extremely skeptical of modernity. Freddy Douglas plays Cutler Walpole, a man of style who performs useless operations on people who have surgery because it is in style. His character provokes laughter every time he suggests blood poisoning as a potential diagnosis for maladies of any kind.
Dr. Blenkinsop (David LM McIntyre) is the only doctor who is not wealthy and socially acknowledged, perhaps because he is the least remarkable of any of the men, although he is certainly the most decent. McIntyre’s performance here is probably the most realistic and down to earth of any of them, as the actor embodies a sort of quiet dignity.
Sir Ralph Bloomfield Bonington (Robertson Dean), or B.B. for short, is one of the most interesting characters and performances in the piece. He is  the most foolish, absent-minded and misguided of the doctors, yet he is also the most compassionate and morally courageous. Dean remains enormously funny in his character’s ramblings, but as the play progresses, B.B. becomes perhaps the most moral character: Despite his foolishness, Dean’s portrayal of B.B. becomes more vulnerable and emotional.
These doctors take it upon themselves to decide whether Louis Dubedat (Jason Dechert), a great artist, deserves to replace one of the 10 people Ridgeon can treat for tuberculosis. The fact that Dubedat is a great talent and both he and his wife, Jennifer (Jules Willcox), are hugely charming and likeable are the only reasons Ridgeon takes time out of what he claims is a busy schedule to consider saving him. The fact that he might not be the most moral, however, seems to complicate the matter. Dubedat himself says at one point, “I don’t believe in morality. I’m a disciple of Bernard Shaw.”
Dubedat’s dynamic with the other characters both intrigues and impresses. Together, Dechert and Willcox make an exciting pair, but when Dechert is with the other actors, he remains active, while they seem static.
Dubedat creates art while the doctors sit and judge him. In fact, audiences never see any of the other doctors do anything but talk about being busy. They claim to be overworked and that they do “the work of 10 men,” but audiences never actually see the characters treat any patients, do any research or perform any surgeries: they only talk about doing these things.
Dechert’s portrayal of Dubedat, on the other hand, is one filled with vitality and charisma. Despite his disease, Dubedat remains passionate and lively, constantly moving around the set while other characters stay put.
The production is a clever one. Never once does it break out of the world it has created. Even between acts, all the set movers dress in period costumes as if they are servants, and a couple of them even remain in the scenes as minor characters. For this reason, the changes between scenes are much more fluid and interesting than they otherwise might have been.
But, even with these more subtle achievements, The Doctor’s Dilemma succeeds overall because of its larger themes of life and death. The skeleton is the only element of the set that changes locations: It moves from Ridgeon’s consulting room, where it is a clinical scientific artifact and therefore something to study objectively, to Dubedat’s artist studio, where it becomes something much more dramatic and evocative.
This switch mirrors the two character’s relationships with death. For Ridgeon, death is an occupational certainty, something he deals with everyday; it is banal and serves merely as a means to an end. For Dubedat, however, death is romantic and transcendent, full of meaning and passion. He will live on through his art after his death, and is therefore unafraid.
With its complex nature, The Doctor’s Dilemma captivates viewers with its questions of morality. By the time viewers digest the play’s ideas, they might find themselves questioning their own beliefs on the role of medicine and the moral ambiguity behind finding the worth of a human life.

Recent predictions about the upcoming 2012 election, conducted and released by The New York Times this October, project Ohio with a 50-50 chance of deciding the election.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
Swing states such as Ohio have been fundamental in U.S. elections for years, but with the repeal of Citizens United — a landmark Supreme Court ruling that allows citizens and corporations to donate unlimited amounts of money to political action committees — they now play a more critical role than ever in our democratic process. None of these changes would be nearly as significant if not for the Electoral College, which unfairly skews the election process by giving disproportionate voting power to the states.
Supporters of the Electoral College system argue that citizens use the process as a scapegoat for election results that they do not agree with — but this blame is warranted. Simply put, the Electoral College has no place in our democracy. There is no justification for a voting system that has the ability to put a president into office who has not received a majority of America’s votes. This unfair system must be abolished.
The primary problem with the Electoral College is that it gives some votes more significance than others. According to current population estimates, a vote cast by a citizen in Wyoming has nearly four times the influence of a vote cast in Texas. This is because Wyoming has one “elector” for every 177,556 voters, compared to Texas, which has one for every 715,499 people, according to the Center for Voting and Democracy.
Opponents argue that total vote counts in more populated states vastly outnumber those in smaller states, thus prioritizing larger states over less-populated ones. The assertion is valid but goes against another, more important principle: No single citizen should have more of an influence in an election than another. The Senate already evens out the playing field by giving each state equal representation in the most influential house of Congress. Electing the president should be a choice left up to the majority of the nation’s citizens, not a majority of each state’s citizens.
Though skewing the significance of each vote is a serious problem, the more pressing issue is perhaps the Electoral College’s ability to manipulate voter tendencies.
Supporters of the Electoral College continuously argue that the process almost always reflects the people’s will. They usually are correct, as the Electoral College’s choice for president aligns with that of the states 95 percent of the time, according to US News & World Report. The Electoral College, however, has an undue influence in compelling certain states’ voters to go to the polls over others.
According to the Federal Voting Assistance Program, in 2008, critical swing states Florida and Ohio both had more than 66 percent of citizens voting, while larger states like New York and Texas only had 59 percent and 54.1 percent, respectively.
Because of this trend, presidential candidates, now more than ever before, isolate their campaigning to key swing states.
The Washington Post found that swing states Florida, Virginia and Ohio have received more combined advertising dollars than all other 47 states combined. By contrast, California, Texas and New York — the three most populated states in America — don’t even make the top-10 lists of states with the most campaign money invested. Clearly, candidates aren’t getting their messages across to a wide breadth of voters, but instead to those deemed most influential by the Electoral College system.
Our focus should not be on whether the electors cast votes reflecting the voters’ will, but why the middleman is needed at all. The Electoral College depresses voter turnout and encourages candidates to isolate their campaigning around those few constituents. The process thus not only damages the voting process but fundamentally violates the principles of our democracy.
Sixty-two percent of Americans already support the initiative to abolish the Electoral College. But doing so would be a long and arduous process requiring a constitutional amendment. This generation of students must be the one to rally and put an end to this unfair practice so we can maintain our democratic integrity and preserve the sanctity and equality of voting for posterity.

Around 30,000 people die from gun-related occurrences each year, according to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. In the last 30 years, there have been 61 mass shootings, or single incidents involving multiple victims of gun violence —- and most of the guns used in these shootings were purchased legally. In light of these alarming — numbers, one would think that gun violence and regulation would be important election issues.
But neither candidate’s campaign even has a minor focus on gun control. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who signed a ban on assault weapons while governor of Massachusetts, has backed off of the issue completely, stating in 2007 that he doesn’t “support any gun control legislation.” President Barack Obama, who often speaks of gun control while citing his hometown of Chicago, has actually loosened gun regulations during his presidency.
The next president will have many pressing issues to focus on, but gun control cannot be one that continues to be overlooked.
Current gun laws allow for firearms to be purchased at gun shows without a background check, and a ban on assault weapons — signed by former President Bill Clinton in 1994 — expired eight years ago, leaving semi-automatic firearms with militaristic features available for unrestricted purchase. Obama talked about reinstating this ban when running for office four years ago, but during his term as president he instead signed bills that allow guns to be brought into national parks and on Amtrak trains.
As the economy appears to slowly be gaining momentum, jobs remain a constant issue. Though the war in Iraq has officially ended, the topic of war is frequently discussed. Yet while gun violence continues to worsen, it is ignored.
Two weeks ago, three people were shot and killed and four injured in Brookfield, Wis. by a man with a handgun, purchased from a private owner. This summer saw the mass shootings at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. and a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. And  the country is just five years removed from the deadliest shooting spree in U.S. history, the shooting at Virginia Tech.
In the wake of these recent tragedies, there are many who continue to oppose greater gun control. The main argument against it holds that it violates the Second Amendment by taking away the right to bear arms. Gun control opponents note that gun laws won’t stop criminals from using guns and that people need guns to protect themselves.
Not every firearm-related tragedy would have been stopped with stricter regulations in place, but with stricter background checks and ammunition limits in place, many of them absolutely would have. New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts have instituted statewide assault weapons bans, and gun-related murders, assaults and robberies per 100,000 people are all significantly lower in these states, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It is not to say that advocating for stricter gun control is to oppose  the Second Amendment. No gun control advocates have seriously proposed banning all weapons. Instead, they want to implement laws that make it more difficult to obtain guns, such as changing gun show rules, where unlicensed sellers are allowed to sell guns next to licensed dealers, but are not required to conduct background checks. This is reform that could significantly reduce the number of gun-related deaths each year — and reform that makes sense.
Strong gun control advocates are not the only group that supports new legislation, either. Citing polls that were conducted in 2007 and 2008, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence notes that 87 percent of Americans support background checks on private sales of guns and 82 percent support limiting the sale of military-style assault weapons.
Public polling shows overwhelming support for stricter gun laws, yet neither candidate has taken notice. The issue of gun control is a controversial one, but controversy does not mean political candidates should shy away.
Though it might be unreasonable to expect the president-elect to put forward a specific solution offering an immediate plan to quell the problem of gun violence, it should not be unreasonable to expect the leader of the country to address a problem that results in more than 30,000 deaths per year.
Obama and Romney have talked about combating deaths as a result of health care, war and pollution. Whoever is elected on Nov. 6 must take action to prevent further deaths as a result of guns, too.

wow using polls from 2007 and 2008 a bit out dated i think, and last time i check it was spit like the election polls with more people against new gun laws, sorry that i cant cite it sadly. but like any poll it depends on who dose it, and to whom they as, makes you wonder if they chose basis people, and besides look at the elections polls, every one just about different.
Hmm and over half of those “Gun” deaths are suicide  (kind of hard to pass laws that keep people from killing themselves, what would be the punishment, make them live forever?)
How many of those “Gun” deaths were legal intervention, or legal self defense?
Experts surmise about 11%
Chicago PD did a study that estimated of 70% of  homicides (all methods) the victims were felons (Not exactly a lost to society.)
So once you factor out suicides, and felons being killed that leaves about 3900, subtract  about 700 for accidents and you are down to about 3200, now while still tragic, it might well be of a better benefit to do things to control drivers under the influence (DUI’s kill around 10,000, and injure thousands of others year in and year out, but we blame the individual, not the car or what they consumed)
Also bear in mind that the St Louis Public Law Review estimated that armed citizens stop 400,000 violent crimes per year, and deter an additional 800,000, and that is one of the more conservative studies done on use of guns by law abiding citizens.
So stricter gun laws stop violence? explain Chicago to us.
So before you make up your mind about things, you might want to consider more than one source, and check your sources.
A SIMPLE RESPONSE
(Reader’s Digest Version)
I ought to be a poster boy for more gun-control laws. My mother was a forty-four year old a (nobody) when she was shot to death Wednesday morning September 9, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She was waiting to clock into work with co-workers that morning. She was gunned down right in front of them. There was nothing anyone could have done to save her. Her attacker was the only one present who was armed.  He emptied all six shots from his revolver into her body. After she was shot and down on the ground he used his empty pistol like a rock and started to pistol-whip her. Neither mercy nor quarter was given. After his gun was empty and the pistol-whipping was going on her co-workers finally restrained the attacker and held him for the police. She died about an hour later in the hospital E.R. Pardon the details but I have had over thirty one years to live with this fact-of-life no one should have to live with. Being graphic may give a better understanding about what I have come to believe.
Murders exercise real “cruel an unusual punishment” anytime on anyone they please. They’ve no qualms with capital punishment “except” their own. It’s open season on us all. We of course only hear of the bloodshed when they target a high profile (somebody) or (groups) especially if children are involved. For the forth and fifth estates the higher profile, the larger the group and especially with children all the better. Emotions will rule the day and logic be-damned!
The cost a typical murderer pays is small compared to their crime. Freedom from “cruel an unusual punishment” is only a right reserved for the guilty. Their victims just get to die! It wasn’t until many years later I learned my mother’s executioner had murdered before! Just so it is understood a number of major laws were broken that that morning. Here was a violent convicted felon, a convicted felon under a restraining order; a convicted felon with a gun and a convicted felon committing murder again! Any one with half a brain knows these things are all against the law! Simply put neither laws nor the police protect anyone, but more on that latter. Is it just me or is a pattern taking shape here? It sure as hell isn’t a gun.
Murder victims never receive a jury trial; they have no rights to appeal. They are required to die. Often a painful brutal death! That morning my mom just thought she was going to work. She was just going to die! I don’t get to see her again, ever! She has no visits from friends and family as her murderer probably received. I just visit a stone in a graveyard and wonder what might have been if only… At that time we also learned we couldn’t be informed about his trial or his fate. It seems that too was against the law! It took the advent of the internet to finally learn a few meager details, most notably, six years and out. Betty was a (nobody), but as “Momma” she was a (somebody) to me!
So an average of six years in prison is the price most murderers pay. A few years confinement on the taxpayer dime for all of those wasted innocent lives. Now a high profile victim a (somebody) or a (large group) a killer may serve a little more time, maybe life. Maybe, don’t bet on it! Occasionally some do get the needle or as it is being called nowadays by clueless moral crusaders “cruel an unusual punishment”. This of course as opposed to the charity they show their victims I suppose.
Murderer uses the best weapon available to them. Guns, hammers, knives nor rocks simply don’t jump up and kill by themselves. They are all inanimate objects, tools. There are no calls to ban deadly knives, hammers and rocks. Just guns! Any tool used to kill is irrelevant. Dead is dead! So why do the crusaders only advocate gun-control or bans? Is it merely because of the efficiency of a firearm? I’d doubt it, besides as a tool what good is an inferior firearm? ‘We the people’ wish to live free or die trying. Gun-control proponents claim not to too understand or accept these facts. 
The Second Amendment isn’t nor was it ever about deer, duck or turkey hunting! The hallmark of the Second Amendment is liberty. The superiority of a firearm makes it the best tool against crime and tyranny. Proponents of gun-control understand it but will never admit it. If it wasn’t true the police and military would both be armed with knives, hammers and rocks. Odd too that civil liberty and gun-control crusaders show more confidence, faith, and trust with firearms in the hands of rogue cops, the standing army and those “victims” on death-row. One could be tempted to think that when you listen closely to them. How strange they think so little of innocent, law-abiding, peace loving and armed citizen. At the same time they think so highly of armed bureaucrats, rogue cops, and murders! Criminals, the media, politicians and the anti-gun crusaders fear a vigilant, armed and defensive citizenry. The media, politicians and anti-gun crusaders want a government heavily armed with defenseless and submissive chattel slaves. I’ve stated before the motives of the fourth and fifth estates are clear. They understand the stakes in the gun-control game. No longer content to lead as elected to do they’re maneuvering to rule, and rule unimpeded! That is the eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. That should be in the conversation too! But any reasonable conversation must be derailed with sophistry.
Sure I’m emotional about this subject. That doesn’t alter the logic. I’d finally had enough. For years I’ve watched celebrities and politicians, listened to countless anti-gun moral crusaders, talking heads and read all their agenda driven “news” articles. Clueless cunning people with a public platform I’ll never have. They all express the same mindless pap this article did. Big deal! Go right ahead, explain the logic of this ideology to my mother, and shout it real loud. The dead don’t hear well!
You could take guns away if a person wants to kill a person or a group of people they will find a way. I cannot believe people think if you pass gun laws the bad guy will follow the law and not do something because it is illegal.
Medicine and doctors kill more than 200,000 every year. This is with massive regulation and about  59 cents of every health care dollar spent by governments. Bigger government in the gun sphere will likely mean a worsening of the statistics you quoted.
“82 percent support limiting the sale of military-style assault weapons.” This is a lie. You sir have no integrity and no place in America.
“Yet while gun violence continues to worsen, it is ignored.”  I’m a bit confused on this comment.  Violent crime has been going down steadily downwards for a bout the past twenty years.  You need only check the FBI’s website to confirm that.
“In the last 30 years, there have been 61 mass shootings”
In the last 50 years, all but one of those mass shootings has occurred in a “gun free zone”.  I agree that firearms laws should be reformed, but they should be reformed in the direction of more freedom, and the ability to protect ones self in more places. Criminals are among the biggest cowards on earth, they look for easy, unprotected targets. It has been proven time and again that when gun laws are liberalized, crime of all sorts reduces, including that which involves firearms.
Yeah because more guns in the hands of general untrained people in the movie theatre would’ve lessened the carnage in Colorado and other places. Do you honestly trust a bunch of people you don’t know right around you holding guns? The real world is very diverse. It is simple probability: the more guns in a diverse population, the larger chance one of them goes off. Then, all the dominoes fall.
When a heavily armed gunman entered the New Life Church in Colorado and opened fire a carry permit holder who volunteered to work security returned fire wounding the attacker.  She held the gunman at bay, and when the gunman came to the realization that his shooting spree had been thwarted, he committed suicide.
Yes, armed citizens can stop a mass shooting.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Colorado_YWAM_and_New_Life_shootings
I have less than zero problem with anyone around me owning/carrying firearms. In fact I feel that many more people should own and carry firearms. I do not fear my fellow citizen, I fear criminals.. Criminals carry guns regardless of the law, why should law abiding citizens be refused their right to self defense. 
http://dailyanarchist.com/2012/07/31/auditing-shooting-rampage-statistics/
According to the numbers, everyone should want law abiding citizens to carry firearms.
The next president should reform the federal government’s involvement with state and personal issues like firearms ownership by rescinding all the current federal laws and letting the states make their own rules.  If you want the federal government involved, then I want the federal government involved too – by limiting state laws by allowing people of any state to buy guns in all states and allowing any state’s permits to be valid in all states.  So keep it up getting the federal government involved because we can pass federal laws too.
Both major political parties and all politicians fear the NRA. 
If the NRA targets you your goose is cooked. Therefore do not expect any change.
“Next president should reform gun legislation”
The President has little control over what the Representatives of the People want. They can veto, but that’s about it. 
What folks need to keep in mind is that there are some odd 300,000,000 firearms in the private possession of some 80,000,000 Americans. The main bogeyman is usually the NRA (I’m surprised it’s absent from the piece) has less than 4,000,000 members. 
One thing to note that brings it into focus is this:
President Obama could not have been elected in the first place nor will he be reelected without the votes of millions and millions of gun owners.
No one knows more than legislators that gun owners vote.
Only 30,000 gun deaths per year, abortion kills over a million ppl every year why don’t you have government reform that.  Talk about a tragedy , It is not to say that advocating for stricter abortion laws is to oppose  Roe vs Wade see how that works.  What state doesn’t require background checks a gun shows, they do in the state I live in.  Maybe we should ban cell phones because texting while driving can and has killed ppl.
Guns Do Not Kill People!!!! People Kill People. 
In the Second World War, the Japenese did not Invade the United States. They hear that everyone had Guns.!!!!

The USC Trojans fell to No. 17 in the latest BCS standings following the team’s 39-36 loss to Arizona on Saturday.
The Trojans entered their matchup against the Wildcats as 6.5 point favorites, but blew a 28-13 third quarter lead and were unable to convert on a last-second Hail Mary attempt.
In the loss, wide receiver Marqise Lee accumulated a school record 345 yards to go with two touchdowns.
USC also tumbled in the newest editions of the Associated Press poll and USA Today coaches’ poll. They now sit at No. 18 and No. 17, respectively.
Oregon remains the class of the Pac-12 at the No. 4 spot in the BCS, behind Notre Dame, Kansas State and Alabama. Oregon State dropped to No. 11 after losing their first game of the season to Washington, and Stanford moved up to No. 14 despite narrowly defeating the Washington State Cougars. Arizona entered the fray at No. 22 in large part due to their upset victory over USC. They are the only three-loss team in the BCS.
UCLA also made an appearance in the AP poll at No. 25 thanks to a last second 45-43 victory over Arizona State.
The Trojans’ national title hopes are no more with their loss, but they still have a chance to move back up the rankings with an upcoming matchup against the Oregon Ducks on Saturday.

USC defensive lineman Leonard Williams was added to the College Football Performance Award’s (CFPA) 2012 National Freshman Performer of the Year Watch List on Wednesday. Williams is one of four Pac-12 freshmen on the list, along with Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota, Oregon State running back Storm Woods and UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley.
The watch list is meant to highlight freshmen whose performances merit recognition. All of the players are eligible for weekly, annual and career awards. The CFPA chooses their candidates by using objective scientific rankings that determine how individuals increase the overall effectiveness of their teams.
Past winners of the award include Ohio State quarterback Braxton Miller in 2011, South Carolina running back Marcus Lattimore in 2010 and Oregon running back LaMichael James in 2009.
Williams has 21 tackles (13 solo) and 5.5 sacks this season and has served as an important piece of USC’s revamped defensive line. He was ejected in the first half of the Trojans’ 50-6 win over Colorado last Saturday for punching a player, but he was recently cleared to participate in this Saturday’s game at Arizona against the Wildcats.
Who are the real pirates here? Who is stealing what and from whom? The Sri Lankan fishermen we encountered today in their illegal vessels form just one small piece of the Western Indian Ocean jigsaw, where 18% of fishing is estimated to be illegal
