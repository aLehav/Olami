Tucked against the northwest corner of campus, the Temporary Research Facility — a cluster of brown trailers interspersed with patches of artificial grass and tables and lawn chairs — is a modest place for the next scientific breakthrough. Past the facility’s gates, movie posters, abstract paintings and anatomical sketches by Leonardo Da Vinci adorn the building’s walls.
Here, art and science meet with a purpose.
Inside one of the structures, a quote written on the wall just outside the office of Steve Kay, outgoing dean of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, reads, “The Bridge@USC is the foundry where solutions to complex health challenges are forged.”
The words relate an optimistic prophecy for the new Bridge Institute, a research hub that will soon replace the current interim workspace. It will be located in the Michelson Center for Convergent Biosciences and merges the fields of physics, chemistry, biology and digital arts in order to better understand the human body.
Though it will be another two years before the Michelson Center is completed — whose laboratories will be filled by 24 principal investigators from different fields and backgrounds — research at the Bridge Institute is already underway. The group, wrote Robert Perkins in USC Dornsife Magazine, has published six high-profile papers in the last seven months.
Sitting together in a conference room, biochemist Raymond Stevens and physicists Peter Kuhn and Scott Fraser shared their vision for the Bridge Institute.
“So you’re talking to a physicist, a physicist and a chemist — all trying to play biology,” said Stevens, who researches G protein-coupled receptors, the gatekeepers and messengers of the cell.
Fraser, whose research focuses on imaging and molecular analyses of biological systems, reflected on the frontier nature of the endeavor.
“There’s something fun about being a newcomer,” Fraser said. “You don’t know the things that are wrong.”
“One of the visions of the Michelson Building is to be a nexus that brings together all these different groups,” Stevens said. “One of the things that is very important these days is collisions — people running into each other and talking to each other.”
Expressing their vision of a new approach to biological systems, the group drew parallels with Bell Laboratories, the research and development wing of AT&T responsible for the digital communications technology used today. The team hopes they can incorporate the elements of convergence and connectivity seen there into their work.
“Bell Laboratories was created with a dream, a vision to connect each other together, to connect the world,” Stevens said. “What we want to do is to connect the human body.”
The hope of the Institute, the “bridge” linking various subjects, is that by bringing together scientists of disparate fields, a new paradigm of thinking will emerge, one that will conquer the greatest challenge of all — life itself.
For years, clinicians have realized that each patient responds differently to the same drug. This understanding of individualized care ushered in a new era of personalized medicine, where doctors tailor treatment strategies to the individual, rather than treat every patient the same way. Major pharmaceutical companies, however, still fail to recognize the patient as an individual during drug development, resulting in serious losses, both in finances and in lives.
“The success rate in drug discovery is one in 5,000,” Stevens said. “The cost to develop a drug today is $1.2 billion. This is the latest report, and most of that is failure data. In biology, because we don’t understand the system, we’re successful 5 percent of the time. Our knowledge, our understanding of the human body is just not there yet.”
By interpreting the human body as a system, researchers at the Bridge Institute will be able to understand how a drug unfolds within a complex architecture that is unique for each patient. Peter Kuhn, a leading oncologist who invented a method for screening cancer cells with only a sample of blood, elaborated on this paradigm shift. “We have to think differently when we are trying to assess the entire human body and how the human body will respond to certain interventions,” Kuhn said.
Now, new apps and gadgets are enabling people to monitor their risk for a disease and track how their disease is changing over time.
“Science,” Kuhn said, “is the information that is provided to you as an individual to help you understand how to manipulate the disease as opposed to the disease manipulating you.”
With the wealth of data amassed by devices and the infinitude of information accessible through the internet, synthesizing all the relevant information for the treatment of disease can be a frightening task. That’s where the Michelson Center comes in.
Along with finding new pathways through the interconnectedness of diverse fields, the researchers at the Bridge Institute have the responsibility to encourage the next wave of scientists, engineers and designers.
“Our job is to create the next generation of students that frighten traditionally thinking people,” Fraser said. “They’re not going to see boundaries. They need to master a physical concept or an engineering concept to tackle a problem. I think they’re be fearless about doing so.”
As a research center, the Michelson building will offer post-docs, graduate students and undergraduates the opportunity to engage in a laboratory setting and learn a new method of problem solving.
“What we as a faculty need to do is create an environment that doesn’t inhibit creativity — that instead fosters creativity,” Stevens said.
Though the city produces more than 5,000 graduates in science, engineering and technology every year, more than San Diego and San Francisco combined, Los Angeles still trails behind in the biotech industry. A report published last year by FierceBiotech ranked the city 14th for biotech venture funding, and a 2014 report by Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News ranked Los Angeles ninth in U.S. biopharma clusters. Stevens attributes these rankings to the city’s failure to attract innovators in biotechnology.
“There’s no place for [students] to go right now if they stayed in Los Angeles,” he said. “The city of Los Angeles needs to become more helpful for the start-up of biotech companies. That’s one ingredient that’s needed.”
The Michelson Center is striving to change that, and it’s hoping to garner enough manpower to do so.
“You need the people [and] the feeder, that’s going to occupy these biotech incubators. It’s all about the biotech ecosystem and nurturing that,” Stevens said.
And while the promises of transforming the greater Los Angeles and creating the next generation of convergent thinkers are far off, the group is confident their dream will be fulfilled.
“There’s an opportunity with convergence of being purposeful,” Kuhn said. “It’s about doing science in the context of whether it’s a disease or some other function of living organisms. You’re doing science out in the open. You’re doing it out in the rest of the world.”

Rachel Carroll, a junior majoring in creative writing, led a workshop in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Monday night that was designed to influence the way students think about their bodies as part of ‘Body Love Week’ Maya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The USC Women’s Student Assembly launched their annual Body Love Week, a series of events and panels that seeks to promote a healthy body image, on Monday. In previous years, the celebration of Body Love Week tended to be mainly educational, but this year, WSA wants to focus on the healing aspect of it and the creation of safe spaces for students to share their experiences.
Vanessa Diaz, the director of Body Love Week, said students deserve a place to heal on campus.
“Acknowledging that there was trauma in regards to the way you treated your body is the first step,” she said. “The next step is realizing that you deserve help.”
Critical of other “love your body” campaigns like those from Victoria’s Secret or Dove, Diaz wants to do more than just tell people that they should love themselves.
“What I wanted to do was not force people to love their body because that’s very difficult to do,” she said. “I want to see body love as a process, with good days and bad days and days in between. Something that we’re constantly working toward, which is a very difficult thing to do.”
Diaz also commented on how important it is to dismantle the standards of beauty that the nation has set for USC.
Maya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
“[We need to] realize that students in this University are diverse,” she said. “What the country sees as a stereotypical USC student is a very fit and ‘hot’ student. That is very damaging to students that don’t see themselves like that.”
Monday’s kickoff event featured Rachel Carroll, a junior majoring in creative writing and gender studies, who led a writing workshop that focused on helping women realize that there are multiple steps to be taken in the process of learning to love their bodies.
“[The workshop] focuses on realizing that there are multiple avenues of approach for body love,” she said.
Carroll had the audience write three different pieces in which they had to analyze specific parts of their body in terms of how they found them useful, how they loved them or how they hated them. Jordan Fowler, undergraduate student body vice president, found the exercise helpful.
“Usually [when I get complimented] I credit it to something else or justify it, instead of just owning it. And this exercise made me realize that,” she said.
Diaz then led a discussion in which people shared what they thought body love meant.
Maya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
“Body love is something that is always fluid for me,” Diaz said, “One thing that I’ve learned is that body love is a process.”
Shyann Murphy, executive director of the WSA, shared her own experience dealing with learning to love her body.
“I realized that the only images that I’d seen [were] images of women that were extremely thin and fit all these standard definitions of beauty that are not actually real,” she said. “Once I started seeing people who looked like me in real life, I realized that people who aren’t thin can also have good lives. Shifting that narrative was really good for me.”
Tessa Meurer, a sophomore majoring in global health, recalled an incident where someone defended her after a man catcalled her in the street.
“It reminded me that body love is remembering I’m worth more than what I look like,” she said.
WSA has events planned every night of this week. Tuesday’s “Tools for Healing” is a panel of speakers put together in collaboration with other organizations on campus, in which they will feature T-FFED, a Los Angeles-based organization that works to combat eating disorders.
Wednesday’s “It’s a Process” will be a screening of the movie Civil War Sickness, a short film about an individual taking steps to recover from an eating disorder. Thursday’s event is a ‘Self-Compassion Workshop’ in the Engemann Student Health Center in which they aim to provide students with the tools necessary to practice self-compassion. The closing event will be an open mic night in Ground Zero Performance Cafe Friday night.
For Diaz, the hardest aspect about planning the week’s events was having to face her own struggles with loving her body.
“In planning the week, I had to interrogate my own journey and that’s very difficult to do,” she said. “If I wanted to create those spaces for other people, I would have to create them for myself first.”
Though the WSA aims to help particularly women in their path towards healing, anyone is welcome.
“We want to make sure everyone can talk about their experiences and create and environment where everyone feels safe,” Diaz said. “Everyone can come to Body Love Week — body love is for everyone.”

As senior music major Evan Pensis took his seat at the front of the room, 140 inmates shuffled in, finding their seats in metal folding chairs. The crowd was quiet — one man later told Pensis that each of the inmates was on their “best behavior,” afraid that inappropriate behavior from even one inmate would “make the music go away.”
But this silence was polite, dubious. Pensis could tell that the inmates were unsure what to expect from his concert. Their demeanor changed in minutes when Pensis began to play his first piece, a sonata by Soler. They were entranced, scooting forward to rest their elbows on their knees and listen.
“No one fell asleep,” Pensis said with a laugh. “They were, in all honesty, more attentive than most audiences I’ve had in great symphony halls. They listened, they cared, they asked incredible questions, and mostly, they felt the music, exactly as any performer wants their audience to feel it.”
After months of planning, Pensis performed two concerts on Sept. 4 for the inmates at the Arizona State Prison in Florence, Arizona. The concerts were the first in what Pensis hopes to be a series of concerts throughout prisons in Arizona next summer, aimed at providing classical music to a community that is almost completely detached from the fine arts.
Pensis purposefully structured his 90-minute concert to contain pieces that would appeal to a varied audience. He began with three sonatas from three different time periods to ease the inmates in while giving them an accessible illustration of how sonatas and music changed over three centuries. Then, Pensis performed six selections of etudes by Chopin and finished with Danse Macabre by Saint-Saens, a recognizable Halloween song.
“There is this perception that this isn’t going to be something that the inmates can enjoy,” Deputy Warden Sandra Walker said. “But what Evan was playing was beautiful, and I think anyone can connect to that beauty, whoever they are or wherever they’re from. It’s universal.”
Between the pieces, Pensis spoke to the inmates about the technique and history behind his next selection. Each piece in the concert had a specific purpose, and he found it important to explain this purpose to the inmates to enhance their experience.
The most powerful piece came in the very middle of the concert —  a sonata by Prokofiev dedicated to the suicide of a dear friend. Pensis believed that the swelling emotion of the piece would connect deeply with the inmates. When he lifted his hands from the keys at the end of the sonata, he was met with stunned silence.
“They were awestruck,” Walker said. “It was such a deeply moving piece. The men in that room, they had been through a lot, more than [Pensis] can probably understand in some ways. But, his music, it connected everyone in a way that you couldn’t ignore.”
When the concert ended, Pensis stayed for another half hour to answer questions. Several inmates approached him, extending their programs for an autograph. One man said he wanted the program signed for Kaitlyn, his daughter.
“It’s so easy to forget that these are people with families and little kids outside of this prison,” Pensis said. “I think the way the prison system works, it’s easy to dehumanize these people and to forget that they are more than just their crime.”
In the weeks that followed his concert, Pensis received several letters from inmates who were touched by the experience. The letters were different from what he expected from inmates — intelligent, passionate and heartfelt.
“As a ‘sidelined’ branch of society, we inmates can’t help but feel dismissed by the world at large,” one inmate wrote in a letter. “When someone of your earnestness, humility and desire to share steps into our world and so effectively explains some of the intricacies of his performed art. We are stunningly blessed.”
The letters, Pensis said, are why he is determined to embark on another prison concert tour next summer. He only received positive reactions from the inmates. The words of one man have particularly stuck with Pensis — he said that in 20 years of living in the prison, the concert was the first time he forgot where he was.
“I believe that music, for some people, is about more than just performing and perfecting a craft,” Pensis said. “It’s about connecting [and] communicating. There’s something that can be communicated through music that words on their own simply can’t achieve. That’s what is beautiful about this series — it’s connecting and communicating in a way that’s never been done before. I couldn’t be more proud of it.”
What an inspirational story this is.  We need more positive stories like this to offset all the negativity in the news.  Thank you!

Sometimes a story is better told through the eyes of someone who has lived and experienced it. There’s a genuine authenticity behind the statements and the intentions of the material.
That’s why when ESPN was looking for someone to work with executive producer Keyshawn Johnson in directing “Trojan War,” the latest installment of ESPN’s Emmy award-winning series 30 for 30, they turned to Aaron Rahsaan Thomas, a screenwriter, director and producer who attended the School of Cinematic Arts. As a grad student, he witnessed one of the most publicized times in college football: the Pete Carroll era and the rebirth of winning football in Troy.
“When I received the offer, I was excited and I knew that I could do it. I was such a fan of the series that I was excited they were going to continue to do more,” Thomas said. “It’s something I would have watched no matter what. To actually be a part of it is a real blessing.”
During his time as a student, Thomas says the vibe on campus was electric. With every snap of the ball he felt like something he’d never seen before would happen. The Bush Push is a play Thomas can still vividly recall.
“I remember watching in Santa Monica with a bunch of friends. I was at Barney’s Beanery on the Promenade,” Thomas said. “I remember exactly what booth we were in, and I remember the whole place went nuts when it happened. Everybody jumping all over each other. Spilling drinks everywhere and nobody cared. It was just one of those things, you couldn’t plan it. It was a magical moment.”
The national championship game against Texas is also well-documented in the film.
Two of college football’s original blue bloods colliding. One aiming for its third straight title. The other hadn’t won a national title in decades. There was passion on both sides. The stakes were unparalleled, making for an epic game and is arguably the greatest college football game ever by Thomas’s estimation.
Growing up in Kansas City, Kansas, Thomas always loved storytelling and began taking writing seriously after documenting the adventures of his friends. As a teenager at the Pembroke Hill School he played football and and ran track. His passion for writing and sports continued to grow, and he started to realize what he wanted to do professionally during those years.
“If I had a choice between making films, making television or being the starting cornerback for the Kansas City Chiefs, I would still choose the film,” Thomas said. “That’s my passion. Whenever I run into athletes that’s the way I look at it. OK, your passion was becoming a ball player, my passion was this. There’s nothing else I’d rather do.”
According to Thomas, there was a divide depending on which side of Kansas City you were from. This was during the East and West Coast hip-hop crossover into mainstream pop culture. The side of the city you grew up in dictated which coast earned your allegiance.
“If you grew up on the Missouri side, it’s more about Tim’s and bubble coats, EPMD and Biggie,” Thomas said. “If you grew up on the Kansas side, it was more about Dickies, Khaki’s, Chuck’s and low riders. We identified more with N.W.A. and Pac.”
One film in particular caught Thomas’s eye during his childhood. John Singleton’s early ’90s classic Boyz n the Hood was the movie he felt represented who he was.
“Spike is a legend. I love Spike. But Spike is decidedly New York. I love Do The Right Thing but it wasn’t my life. Boyz in the Hood was my life,” Thomas said. “Tre, the good kid in a bad neighborhood, that was literally me. Once I saw that John Singleton clearly exists, then I wanted to know where he came from.”
Once he  learned Singleton had gone to USC, Thomas says it influenced his decision even more since he was already a fan of the producer and the school. He graduated from the University of Kansas and applied to the USC School of Cinematic Arts. He thought to himself, “Yes, NYU is cool, but I’m not a bubble coat or Timberland kind of guy.”
As a student at USC, Thomas said he learned to not worry about comparing his work to others because each person’s work is unique. He liked the fact that ESPN encouraged individuality. He also knew he had a great story that was different than anything anyone else had brought to the table.
“’The U’ had its own particular flavor. You’ve got the booty shaking, you’ve got Luke. That’s very distinctly Miami,” he said. “SMU had its own distinct flavor. You’ve got oil money; you’ve got Patrick Duffy doing the narration. That’s cowboy, go get ’em rough rider type stuff. But this is L.A. A whole different vibe,” he said. “I knew stylistically there were some things that we could do that would be very different from those two.”
Thomas believes 30 for 30 films fall into two categories: fun and dramatic. He knew the dramatic side wasn’t the approach he wanted to take. To Thomas, Southern California is dynamic and diverse. It’s sunshine and good times. It’s Hollywood.
Thomas aimed to take the audience on an engaging journey. He used a blend of subjects from the cinema school, combined with members of the football team and “controversial figures” to create a unique mix for the film.
Jeff Fellenzer, who teaches a variety of sports-related courses at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, is one of the people Thomas interviewed in the film. He was also a faculty member and worked with the Student Academic Services department within the Athletic Department during Carroll’s tenure. In the film, he was interviewed by ESPN’s Shelley Smith.
“Where I noticed that it seemed maybe questionable in some way was during the games, seeing how packed the sidelines were,” Fellenzer said.
On the sidelines he saw agents, celebrities and former players. Anybody and everybody seemed welcomed.
“It’s not likely that you can keep that under control once it starts,” he said. “When the sanctions came down, I thought that’s one area that’s going to be cited quickly. The practice and the games.”
After the NCAA launched its investigation of Trojan football, it cited the school’s lack of institutional control, and stripped the program of wins, scholarships and Reggie Bush’s 2005 Heisman Trophy. Regardless of his devotion to USC, Thomas wanted to tell a balanced and objective story. One of his main concerns was not coming across as the ultimate homer. If he wanted to be biased, he says he would have just made a recruiting video.
There will be questions, debates and criticism, all of which are part of a production of this nature, according to Thomas. He stands by their work and thinks it will be a fun ride for the audience.
“At the end of the day it was a great era, it was a fun era. It was entertaining and it gives me great memories,” Thomas said. “I just hope the audience can take away even a little bit of what I felt experiencing that era.”
“Trojan War” will first air on Oct. 13 at 6 p.m. PST on ESPN.

The women’s soccer team defeated Washington State on Thursday before falling to Washington on Sunday.
The Women of Troy faced a  top-25 squad in Washington State and came out victorious. Junior midfielder Morgan Andrews scored the                     game-winning goal with just 12 minutes remaining. The goal was Andrews’s third in four games.
By earning 11 corner kicks and taking 20 shots, USC put a tremendous amount of pressure on Wazzu. The Cougars eventually conceded, and the Women of Troy walked away from Pullman with an important conference win.
This was a massive win against a quality opponent, as the Cougars had just one loss heading into the contest.
The Women of Troy had not lost since their early September clash with North Carolina, and they brought plenty of momentum with them to Seattle for the match against Washington.
The Huskies are another elite team from the Pac-12 North and figured to provide a real test for USC.
In the end, Washington edged out USC 1-0. Despite the fact that the Women of Troy were nipping at the Huskies’ heels after falling behind, they could not find an equalizer.
Goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme continued her outstanding run of form, as she made five stops against Washington after making four against Washington State.
USC has not conceded more than two goals in a game since Keidane McAlpine took over the head coaching duties, which shows just how defensively adept this team has been.
USC exhibit excellent discipline when they do not have the ball, always staying organized and working as a unit.
The Women of Troy are obviously very skilled in possession as well, but their defensive prowess is what makes them a legitimate national title contender.
The loss to Washington may hurt in the short term — especially because the only goal of the game came via a penalty kick — but this team has shown the ability to bounce back time and time again.
After losing to Florida State, the Women of Troy took care of business against UC Riverside. After losing two games on a road trip to North Carolina, the team went on a six-game tear without losing.
The undefeated streak came sputtering to a halt in Seattle, but this USC team challenged a quality opponent in Washington — and did so on the road.
The Women of Troy have two wins and a loss in conference play. The team will now prepare for its upcoming matches against Arizona State and Arizona at McAlister Field.

At a school known for a tradition of football dominance and excellence in academics, it can be easy to forget that USC gives students a lot of other things to be proud of. USC has one of the best women’s volleyball teams in the country, and right now they are the best. The Women of Troy are riding an undefeated season to the No. 1 spot on the AVCA poll.
Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio is largely responsible for her team’s success and has been named Pac-12 Volleyball Offensive Player of the Week four times in a span of five weeks, something that has never been done before. That brings Bricio’s award count to seven in her career, making her the most decorated women’s volleyball player in USC history. On Sept. 30 Bricio was named espnW National Player of the Week. That was her second national weekly award, as she was named AVCA National Player of the Week as a freshman.
Bricio is surrounded by a group of equally talented teammates who have contributed to a perfect season. Senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms has earned some recognition of her own, winning her first career award in the form of the Pac-12 Volleyball Defensive Player of the Week award on Sept. 28.
The pair of seniors have led their team to wins over Pac-12 rivals UCLA, Stanford and, most recently, Washington. The win handed the Huskies their first loss and advanced USC to the No. 1 spot.
The win against Washington was especially significant for Bricio, who had a career-high 27 kills, moving up to fourth all-time in career kills at USC. She now has 1,695 in her career, 30th in Pac-12 history, and needs just five to become just the third Trojan ever to reach the 1,700-kill mark.
Bricio’s outstanding season is obviously a huge reason for the Women of Troy’s success, but it is hard to say what exactly has helped this team maintain such a record-breaking season. The Women of Troy are a perfect 16-0 as we approach the halfway mark of the season, matching last year’s win total.
Last year’s team went 16-16, including losses to Washington, UCLA and Stanford. Bricio and Ogoms were still key components last season, so it’s hard to say exactly what is different about this year’s team.
What I do know, though, is that we could be witnessing a potentially undefeated championship run by the Women of Troy. So consider this a PSA, if you will. I love football just as much as the next person, but let’s give credit where credit is due. The football team is not the most dominant team on campus right now, and even though Cody is in the middle of a Heisman campaign, he’s not the best athlete at USC right now either.
The season is only half over, so there’s still time to witness the second half of USC’s championship run.
The rankings mean really nothing at this stage or anytime. The ncaa tournament is what counts, and who makes the final four.
The sweet sixteen closest to USC is in San Diego. Single elimination for all tourney matches is when you want to go undefeated.
Actually better to lose one during the regular season to see how team responds.

USC’s defense looked excited Monday, as they prepare to “rattle” freshman quarterback Jake Browning. But no player more so than fellow freshman  and friend, Cameron Smith.
“I definitely will see him after the game just to say congrats, wondering how he’s doing,” Smith said after practice. “I’ve watched a couple of games. He’s doing a great job so far. So I’ll talk to him and wish him luck.”
Smith played Browning, the quarterback for nearby Folsom High School, his junior and senior year at Granite Bay High School. But it’s hard to fathom that the players ever imagined they would be facing each other this soon in their college careers and possibly have consequential impacts on the outcome of the game.
“You hope for that. You hope to see him do well. But seeing him like this is going to be cool,” Smith said. “He’s a great player who really works hard, and I’m excited to see what he does in the future.”
Both Granite Bay products have made remarkable accomplishments as true freshmen at their universities. Smith leads the Trojan defense in tackles, and Browning is the first freshman quarterback to ever start a season for the University of Washington. Though Smith admitted that making the transition from high school might be especially hard for a quarterback, he believes that what he’s seen from Browning already will make him a successful player in the future.
“He has the arm strength and the accuracy to reach everywhere,” Smith said. When asked if he has any particular insight into stopping Browning, Smith added, “We’ll need to get into his head and get him rattled a little bit. But, he’s a great player. He’s not going to move around to move, but he is going to get the ball out quick.”
Head coach Sarkisian, who coached Washington for five years, also knows Browning from his play at Folsom High School.
“I like Jake a lot. I recruited him when I was up there, and Jake has got a good feel for the game,” Sarkisian said. “He’s a tough kid. He is heady. He’s played a lot of football in high school. So, he’s gotten better from week to week to week. He’s going to be a heck of a player in our conference.”
Browning has thrown five touchdowns and four interceptions this season. defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox said that setting edges, striking blocks, finishing tackles and getting a lot of bodies by the ball as things the defense is working on being more consistent in. The Trojans’ defense is coming off a clinical performance against Arizona State forcing four turnovers for 28 points and three sacks. They’re looking to bring similar pressure Thursday night in hopes of making the Washington freshman quarterback uncomfortable.
“We definitely want to rattle his cage as Coach Sark mentioned to us earlier [to] make him nervous,” linebacker Jabari Ruffin said. “We realized that he has a lack of experience on this level, and I’ll do the most I can to make him uncomfortable back there and disrupt their offense.”
Ruffin said that his leg feels more comfortable each day after being sidelined all last season after tearing left knee ligaments in 2014 fall camp. He said, “I can feel myself making the progression, be it trusting my leg or getting into the rhythm I missed being out the past year.”
Ruffin added that on defense, bringing five-man and seven-man pressures throughout the game is something really fun for him as a linebacker.
“Practice was very spirited,” Sarkisian said. “A lot of game plan work. I thought the guys came out focused, and it will be really key that we have student meetings this evening to really polish things up so we can come out tomorrow morning, and we can clean this game plan up and get right on point to what we’d like to do.”

The month of October is often centered around Halloween made festive by pumpkins, trick-or-treat candy and costumes. However, the arrival of October is also reason to celebrate the taste of Italy as it’s also National Pasta Month. Whether it be spaghetti, linguine or fusilli, many recipes cater to an array of preferences.
Shrimp Scampi
Though shrimp scampi is often thought of as a dish often found at upscale restaurant, a do-it-yourself version only takes 15 minutes to whip up. Using ingredients that are uncomplicated, this recipe accommodates the college student’s budget and schedule.
2 ounces linguine
½ tablespoon unsalted butter
¼ pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon minced garlic
¼ teaspoon chili powder, to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable stock
1 tablespoon lemon juice
Salt and pepper, to taste
½ tablespoon parsley leaves
Handful of grated Parmesan cheese
Serves 1. Active: 15 minutes; total: 25 minutes.
In a large pot of salted, boiling water, cook pasta according to package instructions and drain well. Melt the butter in a pan over medium high heat. Add shrimp, garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook the shrimp until it turns pink, which will take about two to three minutes. Stir in the vegetable stock and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer; remove from heat and stir in the parsley and Parmesan with the pasta.
Zucchini and Lemon Spaghetti
Those who are missing summer can import citrus flavors to this dish. With the addition of lemon, what would ordinarily be a heavy, carb-filled recipe is transformed into a refreshing dinner. Additionally, grilled chicken can be combined for added protein.
4 ounces whole wheat spaghetti
2 tablespoon olive oil
2 medium zucchinis, sliced lengthwise
1 tablespoon minced garlic
Fresh sage and parsley, to taste
2 tablespoons Romano cheese, plus more to top off
Zest ½ of lemon
Salt and pepper, to taste
Serves: 2. Active: 20 minutes; total: 25 minutes.
Cook the packaged spaghetti to al dente. In a pan, simmer olive oil on medium heat, adding the zucchini to sauté for four to five minutes. Add the garlic and herbs, allowing the zucchini to be cooked thoroughly. Return spaghetti to pan to heat through, adding the cheese and lemon zest.
Spaghetti Squash
For gluten-free diets, spaghetti squash is a worthy alternative to regular pasta. Also another way to adapt to a healthier lifestyle, spaghetti squash is actually very easy to make and only requires a microwave.
1 small squash
Salt and pepper, to taste
Any pasta sauce
½ cup Parmesan
Serves: 4. Active: 10 minutes; total 12 minutes.
Pierce the squash in several places all over. Microwave the squash for 10 to 12 minutes, rotating halfway through. Cut the squash in half and scrape it lengthwise to make spaghetti-like strands. Scoop squash on a plate, and top with salt and pepper, pasta sauce and cheese.

Last week, actress and women’s rights activist Geena Davis sat down with The Guardian to discuss the depressing numbers game for women working in Hollywood today. Many people who have followed this issue know the plain truth: It’s hard out there for women in Hollywood, no matter their title. The cards are undeniably stacked against us when we attempt to forge a career in the industry.
Davis has been a longtime pioneer of women’s rights in Hollywood. Not only is she an Academy Award recipient for her role in The Accidental Tourist, she is also the star of Thelma and Louise. On a personal note, Thelma and Louise was a particularly influential film for me as a  young filmmaker. During my first year at USC, I presented on the male dynamics in the feminist-driven plot. Davis’s character arc, which stretched from a sweet Southern wife to a passionate, stick-to-your-guns woman is what appealed to me most about the film.
Beyond her film work, though, Davis played a female president for one season in ABC’s Commander in Chief in 2005. It goes without saying that Davis only chooses roles that she feels she supports 100 percent. Which is why, as she states in her interview, for most of her career she’s only been in one movie a year. But that transformed in her forties, when, as Davis stated, she only completed one film during the entire decade.
Davis went on to say that she’d been lucky enough not to experience the rampant sexism that so many of her colleagues have experienced, and continue to experience, firsthand. The singular major incident she can recall during her career was when a male director said his favorite part of the day was their morning hugs before set, when he could “feel [her] up.” Davis told him to stop it, which he promptly did. Otherwise, Davis said she’s “been lucky.”
However, Davis’s real turning point came in 2002, when she gave birth to her daughter. Soon after, Davis said she realized that the male to female character ratio in the animated shows her daughter was watching was alarmingly low. This prompted her to start the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, which mostly specializes in educating children on how to be “savvy media consumers” and researching data on women and girls in media. The result? People can be more educated about inequality in the industry with incredible fluency and knowledge.
In her interview, Davis drops statistics and data as if it were second nature. And she’s not angry about it. She’s matter-of-fact. She also posits various ways to change the numbers game, not just in animation, but the bigger picture. For instance, Davis suggests taking a network pilot and changing half of the characters’ names to women’s names, without regard for whether or not the role was written for a woman. This would transcend any possible stereotypes a writer may imbue onto a female character.
Basically, Davis’s activism reaches deep into the Hollywood underground and emerges with data, answers and, most importantly, hope. This woman is smart, thoughtful and impassioned. And barely anyone is talking about her.
The Guardian article in question was published last week, and I first heard of it — not, as most of my news is gathered, from a suggested post on Facebook or a quick retweet from a friend — but by my editor, who is naturally invested and aware of many different aspects of publishing and the media, more so than the average consumer. Which got me thinking, why hasn’t Davis’ article been picked up by more outlets? Why aren’t her institute’s findings more prominent?
And then it hit me. As a 59-year-old veteran of the industry, Geena Davis is by no means “new news.” Which isn’t to say she is “old news,” but I think what separates her from a front page article on Broadly or Glamour or something equally as “hip” is the fact that she’s not “young news.” These days, we are bombarded by images and information about the young, beautiful women who dominate the entertainment industry with their girl squads and feminist manifestos. Emma Watson is the clearest example of a young actress who made major headlines when she became the face of the #HeForShe campaign last year. The same goes for Lena Dunham and her female-centered newsletter, Lenny. And Taylor Swift for surprising her tens of thousands of fans at sold-out shows with a new barrage of young female friends that dance around together, united in their womanhood. Then there is the even younger generation of female feminists gaining a worldwide following, beginning with Amandla Stenberg and extending to media’s newest sensation: 13-year-old Disney Channel star Rowan Blanchard, who made waves by speaking eloquently at a United Nations Women conference on gender inequality this past summer.
I realized that even though Davis is doing all that she can to valiantly make change within the industry, she can only do so much when she must not only face adversaries as a woman, but also as a woman past a certain age. Despite the fact that the content is there, mainstream news outlets — or more importantly, outlets that reach the younger generation most in need of this information — seem to find little interest in a woman that doesn’t fit their key demographic. This is where the problem lies. There is information being gathered and intelligent options for change being given, but if the channel isn’t there to broadcast this information — and is instead focused on the newest, bright shiny thing — we can never achieve true equality. Though there aren’t any surefire answers, it’s also comforting to know that there are women who appear more “behind-the-scenes” than others who are giving their best effort to promote change. Let’s hope it’s enough.

As downtown Los Angeles undergoes a transformation to rival the nation’s other urban giants, the city now has an art museum to fit the bill.
The Broad — pronounced like “road” — was funded by billionaire philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad as “a gift to the people of Los Angeles.” The museum gives Angelenos a new reason to venture Downtown. Set in Bunker Hill next to Frank Gehry’s iconic Disney Concert Hall and across the street from the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Broad is L.A.’s first major free art attraction since the Getty opened in 1997.
And the city is more than ready. The wait list for weekend admission currently extends until December. More than 80,000 people secured ticket reservations within days of the museum’s Sept. 20 opening.
Eli and Edythe Broad are no strangers to Los Angeles’s contemporary art scene. A few years ago, the couple helped to save the Museum of Contemporary Art, which had a depleted endowment. During MOCA’s opening night, Eli could be seen giving a personal tour to President Bill Clinton who came to town to see the inaugural exhibit.
The Broad’s building is a work of art in its own right. Designed by New York architecture firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the $140 million behemoth features a captivating perforated exterior shell laid over a box-like glass enclosure. An instant downtown landmark, the Broad’s building finally gives the Disney Concert Hall some needed competition in the running for L.A.’s most futuristic architectural feat.
The museum’s entrance area is undoubtedly cave-like, in the best way possible, with exaggerated curved walls that make one feel small. It seems intimate, particularly when visited at night. The main escalator, which is reminiscent of something from the Space Mountain theme park ride, creates tangible anticipation as it leads visitors to the third floor where the exhibit begins. The juxtaposition between the museum’s entrance and the art viewing spaces is striking, as the glass ceilings allow light to spill into the sweeping gallery.
Los Angeles art critics were quick to describe the museum’s collection as predictable. Many argued that the organization of the inaugural exhibit seems like a hodgepodge that doesn’t inspire thought or conversation. Because it is sorted chronologically, the museum inadvertently segregates white male artists from females and international artists. However, this could easily be seen as an art snob’s appraisal. Without a doubt, the Broad delivers great pieces to Los Angeles.
The gallery features 1950s art first, including greats including Jasper Johns’s “Flag” and pieces from Robert Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly. In the next room, viewers are greeted by the recognizable pop art of the 1960s. The museum currently houses “I … I’m Sorry!” by Roy Lichtenstein and works by Ed Ruscha and Andy Warhol. Twombly and Lichtenstein each have their own rooms. In the next hallway of the third floor, the museum features works from 1980s, including pieces by women and artists of color like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger and Kara Walker.
Contemporary artist Jeff Koons is particularly well-represented with his larger-than-life stainless steel works, including “Balloon Dog” and “Tulips,” and his porcelain sculpture “Michael Jackson and Bubbles.” In a reflection of today’s sharing society, a number of visitors stop to take pictures and selfies with these spectacle pieces. Unquestionably, the Broad is an Instagrammer’s dream.
The bottom floor contains 21st century works, including a video piece by Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson and the particularly stunning 82-foot-long painting “In the Land of the Dead, Stepping on the Tail of a Rainbow” by Japan’s Takashi Murakami. Murakami’s painting was too large to fit on any one wall in the gallery, so the artist agreed to have it split into panels continuously displayed on two walls. The first floor is also home to the motion piece “Bateau de Guerre” by the late Chris Burden, who has a number of pieces featured at LACMA. As typical in a contemporary art gallery, the Broad features several pieces that are reflective of current events, including Robert Longo’s incredible charcoal rendering of the Ferguson Riots.
Arguably, the most talked about piece at the Broad is an installation by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama titled “Infinity Mirrored Room — The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away.” Previously featured in New York, the work is a small, square room of mirrors and hundreds of colored lights, where viewers enter one at a time to see a reflection of themselves in the piece.
In the future, the first floor galleries will house temporary exhibitions. According to museum officials, pieces are being added to the collection at a rate of one per week. This room for growth will allow the museum to continually develop and hopefully match the hype of its setting and prestige.
There is still weekday availability to view the Broad’s collection before December, and free tickets can be reserved on the museum’s website. If a selected date is sold out, visitors are welcome to wait in a standby line for availability. The Broad is open six days a week, Tuesday through Sunday.

Betty Bong | Daily Trojan
Last week, on the 274th day of 2015, the 294th mass shooting since Jan. 1 took place. That calculates to approximately 1.1 mass shootings each day this year.
In Roseburg, Oregon, students of Umpqua Community College began their Thursday morning like any other: They planned out their day, studied for last-minute exams and stressed over past-due homework. Nothing could have prepared them for the mass shooting that left 10 of their peers dead. And apparently, nothing — not even gun laws and restrictions — could have prevented this tragedy either.
It’s been 16 years since the Columbine High School shooting. But even as we’ve seen scores of mass shootings at schools nationwide, there has been no change. Even after the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 that resulted in 26 fatalities, there has been no change. Even after the 45 school shootings in the United States so far in 2015, once again, there has been no change. As President Barack Obama explained after the UCC shooting, “We have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths.” We live in a country where the people who are supposed to protect us end up being our own demise. Gun reform on a national level is still compromised by Congress and legislation, and it needs to stop.
One of the solutions to these reccurrences is blatant: enforce stricter policies on gun laws and see an immediate shift in gun violence. Though it won’t end gun violence in its entirety, it’s a start. In the wake of repeated mass shootings, Congress hasn’t helped end the brutality and has enabled the progressive gun violence.
Current gun protection regulation has proven tactless. This includes the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which prohibits the right to bear to arms if one does not meet certain criteria. While people listed, including fugitives and domestic abusers, are turned away from acquiring a gun, many aren’t prosecuted for their attempts, so they can find other means to obtain one. The act also doesn’t require mental evaluation, which should be necessary today when many shootings are fueled by perpetrators with mental illnesses.
Pia Carusone, senior adviser of Americans For Responsible Solutions, an anti-gun violence group, said in an MSNBC interview that even the simple enforcement of nationwide background checks could make all the difference. And while this appears easy to implement, Congress still argues that there are already enough gun laws enforced, background checks can be considered an invasion of privacy and that most criminals resort to the black market for their weapons.
“The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws — even in the face of repeated mass killings,” Obama said.
Yet, while the U.S. remains a world leader, it is also, as the Wall Street Journal notes, a world leader in number of mass shootings. Nations such as Australia and Britain hardly experience gun violence, let alone mass shootings. After incidents of gun violence between the 1970s up till the mid-1990s, these nations implemented effective gun regulations. As a result, the U.K. only had a total of 1.8 million licensed guns for a population of just under 65 million as of last year. This should set for the United States; when terror and tragedy takes the lives of innocent bystanders, something needs to be done to prevent it in the future.
Since the Sandy Hook shooting, the public has expected gun legislation reform. There have now been 142 school shootings since Sandy Hook, and over 80,000 people have been killed by a gun. Though state action proves hopeful, with some states providing stricter gun laws that successfully reduce gun-related deaths, there always seems to be a loophole. As long as the Second Amendment remains intact, Congress will always hide behind its vagueness to avoid gun reform on a national level. Until a nationwide change is made, students, parents and children live in fear that the events that took place at UCC can happen to them next.
The lives that have been lost due to gun violence represent a sum that objectifies the matter. Enough is enough. These are individuals with families, with loved ones, with lives they should’ve been able to live. It was enough that fateful day in 1999 in Columbine, Colorado, and it was enough last week in Oregon. The United States can’t live in a constant state of mourning any longer.
“There have now been 142 school shootings since Sandy Hook, and over 80,000 people have been killed by a gun” your death statistic counts suicides, which in some years account for 2/3rds of Gun related deaths….while most years it constitutes around half. Misleading information is impossible to proport in the age of the internet.

Today is the first Tuesday of October, which just serves as another reminder of how much closer I am to needing to have my life figured out.
I think that many people in my situation are feeling the same way. This past weekend, several of my peers took the LSAT, and the quickly approaching Nov. 1 date marks a popular submission deadline for internships and academic program admissions. For seniors especially, these benchmarks bring up the eye-rolling question of what they will be doing after college.
We up the ante for these questions when we mix in the anxiety factor. Anxiety has replaced depression as the leading mental health disorder for U.S. college students. The pressure is on.
Additionally, our generation reports the highest levels of stress with the least avenues of relief, as a recent American Psychological Association study found. Our work-life balance is out of whack, our constant connection to others can become suffocating and the question of, “Will this application lead to a job?” becomes more and more real each day.
Even for the most self-assured students, fall semester is a difficult time. It does something weird to our psyches. It leads us to dissecting every single decision we’ve made since stepping foot on campus, discussing life plans with equally distressed friends over Yogurtland and continually refreshing job listings on USC’s career website just to make sure no opportunity goes unnoticed.
“[Millennials] are at the beginning of their careers, which inherently creates stress, and the unpredictability of the job market adds another level of stress,” Jane Rheineck, an associate professor in the Department of Counseling at Northern Illinois University, told Counseling Today.
With a measurable amount of time until we enter the “real world,” we seniors are truly beginning to recognize that our time here at USC is finite.
When I asked my friends — all of whom are on Team Millennial with me — how they would describe their senior years, they all painted a similar high-pressure picture.
Isolating.
Suspenseful.
Cray.
Trying.
One friend even described his fall semester as a “crepe, not pancake” because it’s got him spread so thin.
We’re not alone.
Many of us are coming upon an end of an era; our institutional academic lives are coming to a close. This can have psychological effects, and the only way to treat them is to acknowledge that they exist.
Luckily, there’s an app for that. Just kidding — there might be one, but that’s not what’s going to assist a millennial in the weeks ahead. There’s something more old-school that helps.
Support systems are essential at this time. Tapping into support systems we have established over the course of college is one of the best solutions to tackling the psychological weights of senior year.
Support systems also help silence the doubts that rage in our heads. They’re particularly effective for millennials, who many scholars have concluded are dually individualistic and group-oriented.
Morley Winograd, a senior fellow at the Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism who has studied millennials for the past decade, said young adults today are very concerned about how they can impact others.
Support systems come in many different forms. They’re parents, boyfriends and girlfriends, roommates and sometimes professionals. The University has made significant steps in increasing the support systems on campus. Early last month, the counseling center at the Engemann Student Health Center added six new full-time staff members.
Plus, when you identify people whom you can rely on, it becomes one less task you have come fall semester of senior year.
This is how we can fight off these feelings of isolation. In a world that constantly connects young adults through technology and social media, we frequently live through shared experiences. More often than not, we will be experiencing feelings at the same time. Thus, we can alleviate one another’s shared anxiety over our futures hanging in the balance.
Changing our mindset of how we approach the second half of this semester will help lead to better senior year experiences among those going through any form of uncertainty.
From what my support system has told me, apparently it does get better. We all just need to remember to reach out to them during this time of change.

Dear Tiffany,
I’m a new student and I’m far from home. I feel depressed, isolated and hopeless right now. Who do I talk to, because my anxiety is out of control and I don’t want to talk to my advisor because I do not want them to look down on me. My thought process is seriously not healthy right now.
Though you feel your advisor might look down on you, if you tell them about your current emotional state, I bet most people would not judge you for it. Mental health issues are more common on college campuses than you might think, especially since many people who suffer from them might not outwardly show symptoms, or feel inclined to talk about it. 
Just as you would seek medical attention for a physical health problem, it is equally important to take care of your mental health. At USC, you can call (213) 740-7711 to have an initial consult with Student Counseling Services. An initial consult over the phone helps the counselors determine what treatment options are best for your individual situation. It is discreet and confidential, and is the first step to accessing professional help. More info can be found on the USC Engemann Student Health Center website.
Being far from home in a new place, compounded with personal and academic stressors, can definitely exacerbate depression and anxiety. Regardless of whether you see a counselor just a few times or for years, it is absolutely normal to seek help. With treatment and time, I am confident you will recover. You deserve to live more healthfully and happily. Please talk to a professional about treatment options — there’s nothing to lose!

Have you ever woken up feeling uneasy and empty? Or maybe you’ve had one of those days where nothing goes your way? Maybe you’ve just gone through a devastating break-up or just flunked that super tough midterm. Maybe you’re feeling homesick. Whatever it is, we all have had our fair share of bad days.
While most of the time watching your favorite rom-com or hanging out with your friends can help turn your day around, sometimes, having a bad day can mean wanting some alone time. For me personally, I find that sometimes having a good cry is very cathartic and can relieve a lot of the pent up stress and emotions I have. So, if you’re having one of those days when you just want to lie in bed in the dark and stare dramatically at your ceiling, here’s the ultimate sad song playlist to help you get those tears going.

Alumna Natalie Camunas spoke on a range of topics from her USC experience to racial adversity she has experienced in the film industry Friday at noon in the El Centro Chicano Center in the Student Union.
El Centro Chicano Director William Vela moderated the question and answer session which was hosted by El Centro Chicano and co-sponsored by the Latina/o Student Assembly, the LGBT Resource Center and the Center for Women & Men.
Natalie Camunas, who holds a bachelor of arts in communication from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, spoke on the reasons she chose to attend USC and her experience as an undergraduate. Camunas said her mother is also an alumna, which initially discouraged her from applying. She considered New York University, but eventually decided to come to USC, where she lived on the Latino floor of her residence hall.
“I didn’t know how valuable, how important that would be … it was like a nest you needed to be safe while you were discovering [USC],” she said.
Camunas also spoke about her experiences transitioning into the USC social scene. Camunas’s mother warned her she might experience culture shock as a USC student.
“I remember my mom had a talk with me … I remember her giving it to me straight: ‘You might be the only Latino in the classroom, you might have an experience where you don’t feel like you fit in,’” she said.
Camunas interned with the Unusual Suspects Theater Company and had conservatory training in the Arts District of downtown Los Angeles.
“I don’t feel like I chose acting, I feel it chose me … I didn’t know storytelling could be your profession,” she said.
She spoke about how her views on race and ethnicity influenced her acting career. She said that she would get into arguments during management meetings where she would refuse to play roles such as prostitutes and maids.
“When that narrative keeps being retold by only women of color that’s what we’re projected out [as] into the world,” she said.
Juan Jimenez, a second-year graduate student studying social work, responded to Camunas’s comments on the challenges and burdens felt in the film industry. Jimenez urged a peaceful approach to racial inequality in the industry and at large.
“When you come back with kindness there is silence and cooperation,” Jimenez said. “If you put your foot down, and your foundation is strong enough, then you can do anything.”
