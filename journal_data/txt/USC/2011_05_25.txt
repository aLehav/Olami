USC’s appeal to reduce last June’s sanctions, considered to be some of the harshest penalties in college sports history, has been denied by the NCAA, according to reports.
Insisting that the initial sanctions, which included a two-year postseason bowl ban and a loss of 30 scholarships over three years were excessive, president C. L. Max Nikias, athletic director Pat Haden and the school’s legal representatives met with the the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee in January in Indianapolis to request the penalties be cut in half.
The appeals committee, however, deemed the severity of the punishment to be appropriate with an official announcement scheduled for Thursday.
With its appeal denied, USC will not be allowed to sign more than 15 players for its 2012, 2013 and 2014 recruiting classes. Under normal conditions, schools are afforded the opportunity to sign upward of 25 players per class.
Additionally, the team will be barred from participating in postseason play in the upcoming season, including the inaugural Pac-12 championship game, provided the team would have been eligible to do so.
Furthermore, the NCAA upheld the provision allowing USC seniors to transfer to any Football Bowl Subdivision school without penalty.  Under most circumstances, players would be forced to sit out a season.
