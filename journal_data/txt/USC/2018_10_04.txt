Trojan Advocates for Political Progress sold sunflowers Wednesday to raise money for the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence in solidarity with sexual assault victims. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Trojan Advocates for Political Progress sold sunflowers near Tommy Trojan Wednesday to raise money for the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, an organization that advocates for policy and education to protect victims of sexual assault. 
TAPP President Alec Vandenberg said the organization aimed to voice its opposition to Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination in light of recent allegations of sexual assault. He encouraged students to call their representatives to reject Kavanaugh’s nomination. 
Vandenberg also said that TAPP opposes Kavanaugh for his record as a judge.
“[Kavanaugh] has a record of not protecting the rights of women and their right to choose [to get an abortion],” Vandenberg said. “Looking at his record on the [Washington] D.C. circuit, we take offense with the fact that he would steer our Court far to the right, especially on social issues.”
Latinx Student Assembly Political Director Stephanie Solis attended and expressed her own concerns with Kavanaugh’s nomination.
“Coming from a state that only has access to one abortion clinic, I think having him in office just allows my state representatives and other state representatives to keep going on their path to deny women access,” said Solis, who is from Kentucky.
Vandenberg said TAPP is asking students to call their representatives to support the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. While the spending bill recently signed by President Donald Trump extended VAWA to Dec. 7, its future is uncertain.
TAPP member Natasha Shields said that there are institutional problems in protecting survivors of sexual assault in the country. Instead of having a long process for seeking justice, she said that survivors should be able to get help “instantaneously.”
“As someone who’s been a survivor, when you’re going through the process you end up having to stop yourself because of all the steps that are required to take,” Shields said. She said there were times she felt the entire process was not worth the result.
TAPP’s event occurred two days after a protest at the Price School of Public Policy against Professor James Moore, who sent a controversial email that said “accusers sometimes lie.” 
Solis called Moore’s statement “dangerous” and said he is “complicit to this rape culture that keeps perpetuating on campuses and in our nation.”

Esmeralda Bermudez, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, told students speaking two languages made her feel powerful growing up in the United States after immigrating from El Salvador. (Julia Rosher | Daily Trojan)
In April, Los Angeles Times reporter Esmeralda Bermudez was confronted by a women for speaking Spanish to her daughter at the park. “You’re confusing the poor girl,” the woman told her.
The alumna and journalist returned to campus Wednesday to speak about discrimination and the importance of language and culture. Nearly 30 students attended the event at Mark Taper Hall of Humanities.
“You would’ve seen when I left the park, I was in tears and later that night and for about two weeks, I was in tears,” Bermudez said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I just couldn’t stop crying. I couldn’t understand why, I just knew that I had this anger.” 
What the woman who confronted her that day did not know, Bermudez said, is that her daughter is trilingual and learning a fourth language. Bermudez is raising her daughter to speak English, Spanish and Armenian. The five-year-old is also learning French. 
The journalist said the incident brought back feelings of inferiority and insecurity from her past when she immigrated to the United States from El Salvador. 
“She made me feel like an outsider,” Bermudez said. “I instantly felt she was superior. Everything about me, from my dresses to my heavy, heavy accent did not belong and was not American.”
Bermudez explained she wanted to ensure her daughter had a strong foundation in language since she grew up not speaking English fluently. 
Despite her insecurities, Bermudez now considers language her “superpower.” 
“It made me feel 10 feet tall speaking two languages because I was a resource for my family,” Bermudez said. 
She also said language became “a window to a whole other culture” when she married her Armenian husband.
Bermudez initially tweeted about her experience at the park, which has now garnered nearly 400,000 likes. When it first began to go viral, her editor encouraged her to write about the experience for the L.A. Times.
Bermudez said she is inspired to share her story to motivate others to stand up for themselves and speak out. 
“Let people know that you have a voice, whatever it is,” Bermudez said. “No one should make you feel like you’re not whole as a human being.”

Kersti Kaljulaid, president of Estonia, discussed how being the world’s only digital society increased participation from marginalized groups, like female, rural and disabled citizens, in the job market. (Thomas Forman | Daily Trojan)
Estonia President Kersti Kaljulaid discussed her country’s use of cyber knowledge to achieve security and welfare Wednesday at Town and Gown.
The discussion, hosted by the School of International Relations, marked the two-year anniversary of her election in 2016.
“I’m very happy to be here in front of you representing the world’s only digital society,” Kaljulaid said. “We have gone through a societal disruption to make sure that our citizens and businesses have a totally digital environment to deal with the state and to deal with the private partners.”
Kaljulaid said that while Estonia is not necessarily a country that develops technology, it has found innovative ways to utilize digital tools. 
“The difference in Estonian society compared to the other developed societies … is not technology itself,” she said. “The innovation lies elsewhere. It is in the process of bringing businesses and government together to help all people, young and old … In other words, we are the quick followers, not creators, of technology.”
During her speech, Kaljulaid championed Estonia’s commitment to e-identity, a mandatory document for all citizens meant to authenticate digital identity, grant access to public services and pay taxes online.
One of the challenges that Estonia faced, however, was incorporating technology into the lives of citizens of all ages.
“It took some special effort to get all people in,” Kaljulaid said. “All generations, of course, need to use it, because otherwise, [there would] be division in society, not social cohesion … [older people] are normally those who are most reluctant.”
Estonia’s digital advances have also led to increased opportunities for marginalized groups to participate in the job market. Kaljulaid championed the fact that women, rural citizens and the disabled are able to enter into the labor force by participating in e-commerce and digital markets.
“Very often people say that digital takes jobs away and we should be scared, but it’s quite the contrary,” she said. “Digital makes job markets more equal, more accessible … and much bigger.” 
Kaljulaid also discussed Estonia’s commitment to national security and cyber safety, encouraging the audience to engage in what she has coined as “cyber-hygiene,” or the awareness of one’s digital presence.  
“Everybody can do one thing: You can train yourself,” Kaljulaid said. “Governments, if they want to teach people cyber-hygiene, have to offer them safe identification means.”
At the end of her speech, Kaljulaid mentioned Estonia’s bid to gain a seat on the United Nations Security Council. One week ago, Kaljulaid addressed the United Nations General Assembly and announced Estonia’s intent to run for the non-permanent seat at the UN Security Council in 2020.
Kaljulaid also noted that she is not considering expanding digital platforms to currency. She said it would be too expensive to implement and may ruin the reputation of successful technology. 
She also addressed concerns about preventing authoritarian states and actors from taking advantage of the technology.  
“Sorry to say, but technology does not solve humankind,” Kaljulaid said. “Whatever you do with technology, it will only reflect your society. Every e-state is a reflection of the state, you have nothing different.”

Since the end of spring semester, USC has been shaken by traumatic and unsettling events. We lost a beloved student leader in our residence hall and new details emerged about the disturbing behavior of a former student health physician. This summer we also began a presidential transition. As a result, students, faculty and staff expressed their distrust of the administration as well as their hopes and dreams for the next University president through the local newspaper and presidential search listening sessions. We are standing at the crossroads of a new University. What we do next will define who we are for the next century. This is both a monumental task and an awesome responsibility. 
This week we face yet another test of our values and character. Across the country, colleges and universities have entertained controversial speakers. Over the last couple weeks, I’ve listened to students express legitimate concerns related to a speaker invited to campus by a student organization. Student organizations have sponsored controversial speakers before, but the concerns generated by this speaker’s content ring a collective alarm. 
In preparation for this piece, I viewed some of the speaker’s YouTube videos. I found the content of his speech to be abhorrent, painful, offensive and hateful. My gut instincts question why a University cannot simply deny a speaker’s invitation to spread his message on their campus. The students have pointed out that this rhetoric has no place in an educational environment that places such a high value on diversity, inclusion and respect for all.
However if we believe that the mission of an educational institution is to seek truth, advance learning and disseminate knowledge, then free speech, even offensive speech, is a prerequisite. We cannot deny speakers who have been invited by the student community based on the content of their message. If we intend to have a critical perspective on what is true and what is false, we need to hear both sides. We could not fulfill our duties to teaching and learning if we barricade our campus from offensive content. 
It is true that our constitutional inability to deny or restrict hateful speech runs counter to our sincere efforts to advance equity and inclusion; however, I want to remind our community that no single speaker in one evening can set back all that has been achieved over the past decade. Our cultural centers, cultural assemblies and student leaders have made tremendous strides in making this campus a safer space for so many marginalized student populations. 
Is it really possible this speaker can unravel all that has been accomplished to make our University better? Should we grant any speaker that much power? I hope the answer to these questions is “Hell, no!” My challenge for our community is this: If we believe in freedom of speech and expression for all, we must be willing to acknowledge vastly different viewpoints.
I believe we have more light than the darkness any speaker has to share. We have had controversial speakers on this campus before and in every instance, Trojans have made this university proud by practicing their right to peacefully protest and remaining true to their values after the speaker is gone. I fully expect our students to show the nation that one evening with one speaker will not fundamentally alter who we are and how far we have come.

California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed a bill last weekend that would put a ban on “disruption and defiance” suspensions for fourth to eighth graders. Essentially, vetoing this bill allows students who are prone to acting out in the classroom to be pushed out of the classroom and directly into the school-to-prison pipeline.
Here’s how the pipeline works. Students who act out often do so because of developmental or familial issues that need attention. Consequently, administrators are inclined to suspend them. Moreover, schools implement zero-tolerance policies when they aren’t equipped to handle students’ emotional issues. Because teachers in overcrowded schools can’t give attention to individual students, it becomes easier for schools to give out suspensions than to actually help students deal with issues. 
Keeping students out of school is blatantly ineffective. It causes them to fall behind on schoolwork, makes them more likely to fail classes and, eventually, influences many to drop out of school. Refusing students the right to learn is the worst punishment. Instead of learning, these kids might end up getting into trouble and putting themselves into unsafe situations because they are denied the safety of a classroom.
The bill Brown vetoed extends a ban that already exists for students in grades K–3, but the “Keep Kids in School” Act would’ve made the ban permanent for K–5 students, and create a temporary ban for 6th to 8th graders that would expire in 2023. 
Brown says he vetoed the bill because he wants individual schools and classrooms to make disciplinary decisions, according to his statement to the California State Senate. But individual teachers and administrators often choose to suspend students not because it’s the best way to handle the students, but because it’s often the only option teachers have that allows them to continue teaching effectively. 
Instead of supporting “disruptive and defiant” students and addressing the root causes of their behavior, schools push these students out of the classroom because of overcrowding and lack of resources. One of Brown’s defenses for vetoing the bill was that part of the approved 2018 California budget included $15 million specifically for improving disciplinary practices in schools. This sounds promising, but when there are 7,508 public schools for elementary and middle school children in California, according to the California Department of Education, that comes out to just under $2,000 per school. 
As a result, schools will continue to punish students with suspension, the main contributor to the school-to-prison pipeline. 
Another part of the problem are so-called “school resource officers,” who, more often than not, are just regular policemen who have not set foot in a classroom since they were in school themselves. The presence of law enforcement in schools increases the possibility for student arrest, rather than school disciplinary action. These students can then can end up in juvenile detention centers. 
At this point, most of the kids don’t get an education at all, because they’re already in a watered-down prison. This further debilitates their ability to finish school, and means they already have a juvenile record before they would otherwise start high school. To make matters worse, students are often unable to return to school because they’ve already fallen so far behind. Without an education and with a juvenile record (which typically can’t be sealed until age 18 or five years after a conviction), these kids are unable to get jobs, and find themselves getting into more trouble. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 68 percent of state prisoners nationwide don’t have high school diplomas. 
Of course, it’s important to note how these policies disproportionately affect minority and disabled students. In California, African American and Latino boys made up half of all “defiance and disruption” suspensions in the 2016-17 school year, despite making up only 30.7 percent of all students, according to the ACLU of Southern California. Similarly, while students with disabilities make up 12 percent of California students, they made up 28 percent of suspensions in the state during the 2016-17 school year. 
The students who end up in this pipeline are already the most vulnerable. Instead of helping them, our current policies are telling them that they don’t belong in the classroom. A ban on these suspensions is a great way forward, but there’s also more schools can do with the right resources. 
Instead of employing “school resource officers,” we should invest in hiring counselors and social workers to help vulnerable students. Instead of overcrowding classrooms, we must reduce class sizes and give teachers bias and cultural competency training, so minority students are not disproportionately punished in the classroom. Instead of pushing students away from school, we need to implement restorative practices that make punishment a learning opportunity for students to improve their behavior.
Too often, schools inadvertently turn vulnerable students into criminals through excessive and unnecessary punishments. Schools are meant to be places of learning and development. Let’s give every student a fair chance before we kick them out.

I’m hungry. I need a hot dog.
It’s past midnight, and I’m slipping through a crowd of concert-goers. I am lost in a sea of other bodies, looking for an empty spot on the sidewalk to call their Lyft back home. Under the light-polluted sky, cradled by the billboards decorating Hollywood, a scent draws me along the sidewalk. Sizzling onions. Crackling bacon. The quiet hiss of a bun warming on a homemade grill. The Lyft doesn’t matter anymore. All that matters is the dirty dog.
I hand over five crumpled $1 bills to the nearest vendor I see, several lining  the sidewalks capturing concert-goers’ attentions — all grilling those same hot dogs on that same portable grill.
For those $5 the bacon-wrapped hot dog is adorned with grilled peppers, onions and three condiments: mayo, ketchup and mustard. It is the dirty dog, danger dog, the L.A. dog. It is distinctly Los Angeles: a mish-mashed product of Mexico and America sold on every popular street corner every night. And while it seems ubiquitous now, the dirty dog is the result of many generations of immigration, acclimation, and modification — a microcosm of the Mexican experience in Los Angeles.
The vendor asks me if I want all three condiments on my dog, and I nod my head vigorously. She hands me the dog wrapped in parchment paper. The sausage snaps as I bite into it, and I am greeted with a symphony of freshly roasted flavors. 
The dirty dog is widely considered to be the descendant of the Sonoran dog, a hot dog popularized in the Mexican state of Sonora in the mid-20th century. Here, the humble American hot dog is dressed with expert care: The typical makeup of a Sonoran dog is a bacon-wrapped dog served with pinto beans, tomatoes, grilled and raw onions, crema, mustard and salsa, served in a bolillo roll. 
As I rejoin the surging crowd, dog in hand, I feel a sense of camaraderie. Around me, cutting through the chatter, is the sizzling of bacon-wrapped hot dogs on a grill. At least a tenth of people I saw had a hot dog in hand, also appreciating the grease, the flavors, the smell. It is the preferred drunk food, high food, street food of this city. And its popularity shows. The danger dog knows nothing of time — more dogs are sold after clubs close and concerts end than at any point during the day. It flourishes in the dark, enticing the night owls of Los Angeles. 
Of course, it didn’t take long for the Sonoran dog to reach the United States, spreading through Texas, Arizona and the rest of the Southwest. Bolillo rolls were hard to come by, so Mexican immigrants in California began to swap the rolls for regular hot dog buns. Sonoran dogs had a pile of expensive toppings to fill out the roll, so the Californian version shrunk it down to a more refined selection of condiments. After all, it was still a bacon-wrapped hot dog full of grilled aromatics and sauce, and it was easy to reproduce and sell.
Because the dirty dog is such a staple of Los Angeles, it is bizarre to think of them as fineable offenses. Yet every day, the dogs are illegal, and Los Angeles is the only major city with strong limitations for street vendors.
For many, selling hot dogs is a primary source of income, especially for those who never received proper training to enter the workforce. Selling hot dogs on the street, even with the possible threat of police intervention, provides more autonomy than a job that pays below minimum wage for maximum labor. For undocumented immigrants, serving the dogs is a risk that endangers their own livelihoods. As it turns out, the “danger dog” carries more danger for the one serving it than the ones eating it.
Lawmakers and social advocates have fought for a better way to regulate street food for years, finally breaking through this year with State Senate Bill 949, a law that imposes new rules for cities to follow regarding their street vendors. Instead of police intimidation and bullying from the local government, the law requires cities to have a sensible licensing and regulation system. While Los Angeles has been in the process of creating new vending legislation, SB 949 will hopefully expedite this process. 
I finish my hot dog and lick the mustard off my fingers, crumpling up the parchment paper and tossing it into another vendor’s trash bag. Somehow, I already crave another, inhaling the smells of bacon and onion as hundreds of hot dogs roast along the street. By now, I’ve gotten far away enough from the concert venue to order a reasonably priced Lyft.
To taste a dirty dog, just walk outside the Coliseum on a game day, visit a nightclub on a weekend or drop by a popular music venue after a big show. Stroll through the streets of the Fashion District in Downtown Los Angeles, or maybe along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. If food safety is a concern, Dirt Dog on Figueroa Street serves a health department-approved version of the danger dog. But really, the dog is best enjoyed when most restaurants are closed.
Weekend nights in Los Angeles belong to the dirty dog. All across the city, hot dogs hit the grill, vendors balking at the dangers posed by enforcement and health department, searing bacon and browning peppers with grace and efficiency. It takes great effort to resist its mouth-watering, iconic smell. But some nights I cede, pay $5 and enjoy one of the best meals Los Angeles has to offer. 
SB 949 goes into effect in 2019. Hopefully, our danger dog won’t be a danger to its vendors anymore.

In her “Behind the Flesh” exhibit, interdisciplinary artist Paige Strabala depicts the complex nature of femininity and identity through a series of oil paintings. The exhibit opened Monday at the Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery. 
Strabala, a senior majoring in fine arts, expresses her own visions and thoughts about the female identity and the psychological masks people wear to control and shape their personas.  
“Behind the Flesh,” an exhibit of six oil paintings, utilizes figurative painting, a style of art that focuses on physical objects in the real world to portray women in different settings and various states of nudity. 
In one painting, a woman looks into a mirror to see someone similar to herself in appearance, but adorning a mask against a background of a different color. In another, two women sit  — one on a leisure chair, and another on a table gazing into the mirror with an expression of confidence. 
Strabala said that she imagines people possessing multiple masks or personas. These masks can be social constructs, like wealth and superiority, or personal dispositions, like vanity and obsession. 
“We learn that by projecting a persona, we can [affect] how others perceive us,” Strabala said.
To Strabala, individuals’  personas exist simultaneously and are constantly in flux, interacting with each other and society to constantly shape behaviors. She feels that people try on different masks as they continuously adapt to uncertain and shifting environments. Personas can represent who people want to be or cover qualities that people are ashamed of. 
“I depict the body, or rather the flesh, as a mask holding back the boundless world that exists beneath the surface of every individual and the constant state of flux between composure and the raw state of vulnerability,” Strabala said. 
She said that individuals create these personas, or masks, because of the many, many expectations and limitations placed on them by society. Different identities arise as people struggle to abide by these pressures; an individual’s mask creates a manufactured image they believe will be accepted and approved by society. These masks embody human desires and can be defense mechanisms that hide true feelings and vulnerabilities. 
However, personas and masks can slowly erode the differences between individual and social identities, Strabala said. 
“The more we slip into these alter egos, it becomes increasingly difficult to define where the shift from the individual starts and mask ends,” Strabala said.
The masks and personas are depicted in her paintings not only through literal masks, but through the female subjects themselves. 
“Behind the Flesh” attempts to capture the tension of maintaining multiple identities, some consciously chosen and others publicly adopted. 
The opening reception for “Behind the Flesh” will be held Thursday from 6 to 8 p.m. The exhibit will be open to the public Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. until Oct. 12.

Founded by Desmond Richardson and Dwight Rhoden in 1994, the Contemporary Complexions Ballet Company put on a performance at Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday. (Photo from Instagram)
On Tuesday, students and alumni filled Bovard Auditorium to be swept away by the Complexions Contemporary Ballet Company’s evening production of “Stardust: A Tribute to David Bowie plus Bach 25.”
Immediately after the lights dimmed for the Visions and Voices event and the prelude to “Bach 25” began, audience members collectively held their breaths. In the second half of the show, Complexions successfully brought the vigor of Bowie’s “Modern Love” and “Young Americans” to the stage.  
Founded in 1994, Complexions has been featured many times on “So You Think you Can Dance” and has won many awards, including The New York Times Critics Choice Award. Touring in over 20 countries, the dance company is known for its signature, nuanced style and study of human movement. Tuesday’s production focused on “genderbending” — evidenced by male dancers using point technique and female dancers lip syncing in Bowie’s stead — according to USC Kaufman School of Dance Vice Dean and Director Jodie Gates, who also facilitated a discussion after the performance. 
During the bridge of “Space Oddity” the male dancer lip syncing Bowie’s anthem broke from ballet tradition and began to stride across the stage in poised pointe technique. 
“My favorite part was when they did that flip … with the group, and changed leads,”  Rebecca Breinstein, a junior majoring in business administration, said of Bowie’s role as the music faded. 
When asked about the details of choreography and theme for productions such as “Stardust,” co-founders and co-artistic directors  Desmond Richardson and Dwight Rhoden explained how the performance came together to form the bold strokes and subtle arches of Complexions’ dance style.
“I was pantherlike, like hungrylike, big,” Richardson said.  “I didn’t understand the nuances until I saw it. And so I’d say about Complexions.  We’re bold, we have this particular structure and classicism.” 
In Richardson’s words, both their styles are “an amalgam of  many things,” and this allows for emotion to bleed through the forms and scenes they create. 
 Drawing from this combination of dancing styles produces a genre-bending blend of ballet, jazz and contemporary dance that succeeds in capturing both excitement and suffering in one graceful flourish. At the end of the song “Heroes,” the dancers formed a queue as one member tripped, was caught and subsequently caught each of his neighbors in a silent, gut-wrenching embrace.
Rhoden underscores the importance of dance as a means to communicate passion and spread understanding about the human condition. 
“I started dancing very late … I couldn’t believe the discipline before me. I was hooked [by] this sophisticated language that I had no idea about,” Rhoden said. 
Complexions, he hopes, serves as a means to “bring together a way to celebrate our differences as opposed to being divided by them.”
Cristyn Dang, a senior majoring in psychology with a minor in dance, spoke about her favorite aspects of the performances. 
“[It] was the polycentrism of their movements,” Dang said. “I’m currently taking a jazz class … and we talk a lot about the centers of the body. So poly, many, centrism, centers, and how you can articulate through the body using these different centers all moving at once.”
The founders of Complexions value personality and individuality as a tool for making connections with others and creating change; Rhoden himself abides by the maxim: “Energy usurps anything.”

Senior defender Ally Prisock has been a starter in every game she has played in since her freshman year. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
After suffering its first defeat of the season on Sunday to No. 1 Stanford in Palo Alto, the women’s soccer team look to start a new win streak with two home games against Arizona on Thursday and Arizona State on Sunday.
Claiming the seventh-best backfield average in the country, the Trojans 9-1-1 have consistently been one of toughest defensive lines in the Pac-12 with notable play from redshirt sophomore goalie Kaylie Collins and senior defender Ally Prisock. USC continues to prove its defensive strength, as Stanford’s goal was the first against the Trojans in 432 minutes and only the 4th goal USC has conceded this season. 
After a 1-0 overtime win against the Golden Bears last week, head coach Keidane McAlpine stressed the need for the Trojans to play every game at their highest level. 
“Often time you learn more in losses, so we can learn from this,” McAlpine said. “We played a really, really gritty game, but we have to be able to execute, especially as fatigue sets in.”  
The Wildcats tout a 8-2-1 record. Though Arizona is not as stout as Stanford, the Trojans will still need to control the pace and possession as they have been for a majority of games this season.  
The last time the Trojans faced the Wildcats, the game went into double overtime with  a game-winning penalty kick putting the Trojans up 1-0. Both teams created multiple scoring opportunities, as USC outshot Arizona 15-8, but their respective impressive defensive fronts are what ultimately sent them into overtime. 
The Trojans can expect the same level of defensive tenacity from the Wildcats but will also need to watch out for key offensive players like sophomore forward Jada Tally, who has 6 goals and 12 points this season. Not only will the Trojan defense need to hold down its end of the field, but the offensive line will also need to be aggressive, take possession early and seize all scoring opportunities. 
As for Arizona State, the Sun Devils have a 6-3-1 record and will be coming off of a 2-0 loss to Utah heading into this weekend’s game. 
Last time the Trojans took on the Sun Devils in Arizona, USC erased a 1-0 Sun Devil lead in the 60th minute to win the game with a final score of 2-1. An aggressive offense, with a successful penalty kick and a highlight worthy goal over the hands of the Sun Devil goalie, combined with a tenacious defense, led to a Sun Devil shutout in the second half.
With their loss last weekend, the Sun Devils will work on their offensive prowess, preparing to take on the strong Trojan defense. The Trojans will need to take control of the game early and secure their defensive line against standout Sun Devils like freshman forward Nicole Douglas, who has racked up 6 goals this season.        
USC will play the Wildcats on Thursday and the Sun Devils on Sunday at McAlister Field.

Freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown has tallied 396 receiving yards in his rookie season. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
USC focused on both its pass rush and pass protection at Wednesday’s practice, running drills designed around blitzes and pass-heavy concepts. Head coach Clay Helton singled out sophomore defensive lineman Brandon Pili, who was particularly impressive in this area and noted that the coaches pushed him throughout the week.
“He has some unique pass rush as a big man, and I thought he did a really nice job,” Helton said.
Even with senior star pass-rushing linebacker Porter Gustin sitting out practice this week with an ankle injury, defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said he was confident with his depth.
“When you have body types like [redshirt junior defensive lineman] Christian Rector and [redshirt freshman linebacker] Hunter Echols, it gives you some flexibility,” he said, also referring to redshirt freshman defensive lineman Jacob Lichtenstein as a possibility to fill in for Gustin.  
Helton said the bye week has been beneficial for positional coaches to identify the specific areas their respective players need to improve upon. 
“Take a fundamental or technique, and let’s improve it this week,” Helton said. “Let’s not try to do a hundred things, let’s focus on the one to two things that you know we have to get better for this upcoming game.”
Helton also stressed the importance of resting players with minor but recurring pains and injuries.
“We didn’t have this luxury last year, to be able to have a bye and get a couple of guys healed up that have a nagging injury week after week after week,” he said. “I think it’s really going to help us.”
The coaches’ final point of emphasis for the week was developing players who might have to play due to teammates’ injuries. With senior stars like linebacker Cam Smith and cornerback Iman Marshall sitting out for rest, young backups such as freshmen linebacker Palaie Gaoteote IV and cornerback Olaijah Griffin took more reps this week.
“Any time you have a bye week, you want to get some guys reps that don’t play a whole lot,” Pendergast said. “So getting those guys to develop more and getting them to communicate more, because their opportunities to play aren’t as much. We’re really forcing them to talk in group settings.”
This focus manifested itself as the younger players ran team meetings this week. Gustin chuckled when asked about the meetings, but said the young guys did a good job speaking up and showing their knowledge.
Pendergast said the younger players stepped up, naming defensive backs freshman Chase Williams and redshirt sophomore C.J. Pollard, along with Gaoteote and Griffin, as players that impressed him. 
“You can see it on tape,” Helton said of the young players’ improvement. “When you’re preparing for games, it’s so much harder to get them in there and get that amount of reps, and this is a great week to be able to do that.”
The Trojans will take an extra strength and conditioning day Thursday before taking a long weekend off, resuming practice on Monday.
Injury Updates
Gustin said he hopes to be 100 percent by Monday and participate fully in next week’s practices. Helton said that redshirt sophomore receiver Josh Imatorbhebhe is getting closer to returning from a sprained ankle that has hampered him since August.

I can normally tell when I’m being a homer. I’m pretty ardent about supporting my teams, and although I’ll roast the USC defense in private and under my breath, my m.o. in public is complete, blind, unfailing loyalty to whatever team I’ve adopted as my own.
This has meant getting into arguments about why Kansas point guard Frank Mason — who I know was undersized and overly specialized to college, but who cares — should’ve gone in the first round of the NBA Draft. No matter how strongly I’m arguing for a point, in general, I know when I’m being overly faithful.
All that being said, I don’t think I’m biased when I say that Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is going to be the best quarterback in the NFL in the next five years.
I really don’t believe this take is hot. Like, at all. Sure, we’ve only seen Mahomes play in five full NFL games so far, and yeah, young quarterbacks can start out hot and burn out quickly (just take a glance down south, where Deshaun Watson is floundering in Houston). But there’s something about this guy, something that goes beyond the stats and bleeds into that intangible category of the “it” factor.
But let’s get into the stats to start, because Mahomes also has all of the numbers to back up any amount of hype swirling around his first four games of this season. He’s already thrown for 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns, posting a quarterback rating of 126.5 and breaking Peyton Manning’s record for most touchdowns in the opening three games of the season.
And he has yet to throw an interception. Not a single one. I do know that someday, Mahomes will throw an interception, and it will be as sad and frustrating as any offensive turnover. But as of yet, he’s perfect. Fourteen touchdowns, zero interceptions. 
Statistically, Mahomes is the star of the show in the NFL so far. He has been back-to-back AFC Offensive Player of the Week. Tony Gonzalez believes he’s going to break the single-season touchdown record — as a rookie. And yet, somehow, there’s more magic to Mahomes than simply what can be read on the box score.
No matter what he does the rest of the season, when I talk about this “it” factor, I will always point to the final drive of Monday night’s game against Denver. On third-and-five on the 45-yard line, with Kansas City trailing by 3 points and the clock ticking down under three minutes, Mahomes took the snap and was immediately bombarded by a Broncos blitz. He backpedaled and darted to the left, with two defenders bearing down curling around his offensive line and flushing him into a full sprint towards the sideline.
And then Mahomes did the wildest thing: As a defender came crashing down behind him, wrapping both arms around his ankles and yanking Mahomes to the ground, he flipped the ball to his left hand. And then he threw it.
Let’s get something straight here. Mahomes didn’t toss a lateral or a pitch with his left hand, which is commonly done by a scrambling quarterback. No, this rookie had the audacity to juggle the ball from one hand to the other, cock back his left arm and throw a 10-yard pass to an open receiver for a first down.
That’s the thing about Mahomes. You can hear that he threw for 192 yards outside of the pocket against the Broncos and understand that he is wildly talented at scrambling. But then he does something like that, a mind boggling play that he makes look effortless, and it quickly becomes clear that Mahomes is set slightly apart from other “great” rookie quarterbacks.
I’ve never seen anything like him in a Chiefs uniform. The thing that gets me the most, however, is that Mahomes is the whole, complete, real deal. It’s not just who he is on the field. 
The kid refused to sign hometown sponsorship deals until after his first season as a starter, saying that he wanted to prove his worth to Kansas City before earning extra profit from its support. 
After his spectacular finish to Monday night’s game, he sought out offensive tackle Mitchell Schwartz — who spent the night blocking fearsome edge rusher Von Miller, holding the six-time Pro-Bowler to a single tackle — and presented him with the game ball, saying he didn’t earn it on his own.
Heck, Mahomes has an Instagram account for his pitbull (give @steelthepit a follow) specifically to “show the world that all of his breed isn’t ‘mean and aggressive.’” How much more wholesome can you get?
In short, if you’re not aboard the Patrick Mahomes hype train yet, it’s officially time to hop on. 
In a season when it’s clear that our established stars are beginning to reach the descents of their careers — Aaron Rodgers, Philip Rivers, Tom Brady and more — Mahomes is setting the bar for a new class of quarterback talent. And he has everything he needs to be the best of the best.
Mahomes might not be the best yet, but he’s working on it in record time. Get on the bandwagon now. It should be a fun ride.
