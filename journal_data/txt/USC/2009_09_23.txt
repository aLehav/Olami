After receiving a C+ on the Sustainable Endowment Institute’s College Sustainability Report Card last year, USC is now looking to bolster its green practices by reaching out to both students and faculty with a new initiative that encourages offices to make their workplace greener.
The USC Green Office Certification Program, headed by USC Sustainability Program Manager Matthew Oden, aims to help offices within the university implement sustainable habits. The program, which kicks off with a training session Thursday, evaluates the sustainability of individual offices and awards them a bronze, silver, gold or platinum rating.
Oden said the certification program’s main goal is to educate people on types of activities and basic changes that can be made to “go green.”
“A common question I get asked by staff is always, ‘What can I do?’” Oden said.
Oden said he hopes that by supporting basic changes in USC’s workplaces, the program, which officially launched on Friday, can become a tool to make major strides toward sustainability at the university.
Through the program, offices will be evaluated based on factors such as tendency to recycle, choice of lighting fixtures and use of Energy Star-qualified electronics whenever possible. Offices will have access to a “green” calculator, where they can input information about their practices and see their green rating. An official evaluation is then conducted before a certificate noting the office’s green rating is awarded.
Though some think the program is a step in the right direction, others said they think motivating their offices to participate will be a challenge.
Mansour Rahimi, associate professor of industrial and systems engineering at Viterbi and an expert in workplace design, said  although the program is a good step toward educating people, he thought it would be hard to convince staff members to participate.
“Staff are already under a tremendous time pressure,” he said. “For them to take extra time to perform new tasks takes away from their daily routine.”
Rahimi suggested that although the program may be an effective awareness campaign, it would need to be written into job descriptions and more attention would need to be paid to a clear task reward system.
Concerns were also raised about of the financial costs associated with going green — from buying Energy Star electronics to switching to fair-trade coffee.
But Oden insisted that costs would ultimately be minimal, and the program would help foot a small portion of the bill by providing complimentary signage and stickers for offices to publicize their green practices.
When it comes to the larger purchases, such as computers or printers, Oden said he doesn’t expect offices to purchase all new products immediately but to gradually change their purchasing habits.
“We want people to be thinking, ‘Next time we make that purchase, we’ll go and buy eco-products,’” he said.
The program aims to include both students and faculty members. According to Shana Rappaport, a graduate student studying communications management who is closely involved with the certification program, it makes the definition of “office” purposefully broad to be as inclusive as possible in inviting participants; even student organizations can participate.
“An office can be a room on a floor that has five people in it,” Rappaport said. “Or it can be an entire floor and multiple departments.”
Though there is no reward for earning a high rating — besides a certificate — Rappaport said offices should want to participate to make the school greener.
“USC takes a lot of pride in itself, and as environmental issues increase in importance, taking steps towards sustainability is something that our students, faculty and staff can all take pride in,” she said.
The hope is that once stickers and certificates make their way into offices as part of the Networking & Awareness category of the program, more people will be compelled to participate. Oden and Rappaport hope to have 100 offices certified by the end of the academic year.
The first training session was an incredible success!
We trained close to 20 people to roll the program out in offices throughout the university.
We’ve had 47 registrations for the training sessions since last Friday and they’re rolling in at an average of 1 per hour today.
Today, we had informative dialogue and even identified a strategies to engage people who might be resistant to change.
I think Dave is a bit narrow in his perception of where we are as a community. It’s all about mobilization and we are well on our way to being a leading university in the sustainability movement. Just ask my colleagues at the UC schools with whom I work closely.
Dave should know that this is one element of a much larger strategy. If many people in our community don’t know what “phantom power” is, then we have to start with things like stickers to engage everyone where they are at.
Many people are misinformed about basic things. For example, many think that our blue recycling bins are for paper only. WRONG – all recycling bins on the university are co-mingled (i.e., paper, glass, metal, plastic).
We have to start from scratch on some things and move quickly to take a leadership role internationally.
Cheers,
Matt Oden
I’m sorry, but I don’t see stickers and certificates as a way for USC to improve on its C+ mark.  Quite frankly, I feel USC has fallen so far behind other Universities (especially California universities), I don’t ever seeing them catching up.  If can’t beleive the answer lies in a sticker.

After a shoulder injury held quarterback Matt Barkley  out of last week’s upset loss to Washington, USC coach Pete Carroll named the true freshman the starter for Saturday’s game against Washington State after practice on Wednesday.
“We’re going to go with Matt in the game,” Carroll said after practice. “It’s clear that he had a very good day today.”

Quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates also noticed an uptick in Barkley’s performance Wednesday, which included a turnover-free practice on a day Carroll stressed would be all about ball security.
“Matt looks good, and he’s getting better every day,” Bates said.
Barkley’s performance on Wednesday was finally good enough for the coaching staff to reaffirm Barkley’s insistence Tuesday that he would be the starter against the Cougars, although the coaches did restrict Barkley’s attempts.
“He’s still controlled, we’re trying to make sure he makes it through practices every day,” Carroll said. “The way he responded today, we felt good about it.”
Redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp, last week’s starter, took a good percentage of the snaps in all offensive drills and looked good enough for the coaching staff to be reassured if anything were to happen to their starter.
“If [Barkley] has any problems Aaron’s ready to go,” Carroll said. “But right now, [Barkley] gives us the best chance to win.”
u
Injuries bothered USC last weekend, but many of the Trojans made steps on Wednesday that helped the coaches get a better sense of where everyone stood.
Senior safety Taylor Mays, who sat out last weekend’s game after spraining his knee against Ohio State, was finally able to return to practice on Wednesday and the staff was confident that he could return to action this weekend.
“Taylor had a good day, but we’ll see how he responds [Thursday],” Carroll said. “He will definitely have a chance to play this week.”
Junior linebacker Malcolm Smith had a sprained ankle that looked as though it would hold him out of action on Saturday, but Carroll described him as “better than they thought he would be” Wednesday.
Junior wide receiver Ronald Johnson, who broke his collarbone during the preseason scrimmage at the Coliseum, is making good progress as well.
“He’s coming out of the sling Saturday,” Carroll said. “He’s the fastest guy we’ve got and we miss his big strike ability, but he’s still a couple of weeks away.”
u
Redshirt junior Mitch Mustain, third on the quarterbacking depth chart, spent Wednesday’s practice working on his punting technique and impressed coaches with his speed.
“He’s a really good athlete and has the potential to be a really great [punter],” Carroll said. “He has a one-step kick, which gets the ball out very quickly.”
During 11-on-11 special teams drills, Mustain took just one snap as the punter, but was able to land the punt inside the 10-yard line and the kick coverage was able to down the kick at the one-yard line.
“He’s kicking about .300 right now, which would be great in baseball, but he’s got plenty of potential,” Carroll said.
Thank. God. Barkley’s. Back.

Standing among men made giants by pads and cleats, Frankie Telfort is almost dwarfed. He exudes an austerity punctuated only by the gold chain and diamond studs he decorates himself with. He rarely smiles.
Until late July of this year, the cusp of the new season, Telfort was one of the most highly touted football recruits in the country: a fast, slightly undersized outside linebacker known for the strength of his hits and the depth of his football intelligence.
Looking on · Frankie Telfort (right) was all set to play linebacker at USC. But after being diagnosed with a heart condition, Telfort has found a new role. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
One day in July, however, Telfort was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a congenital heart defect that could be deadly for a high-performing athlete. Telfort’s career as a player ended immediately. Standing among his fellow Trojans after a recent practice, he recalled those moments of loss with a detached honesty.
“It was pretty tough, just trying to transition from playing ball to not playing ball. It’s something you love and it gets stripped away from you,” Telfort said, his voice steady as he recalled the memory.
But Telfort’s words suggest that those few weeks after his diagnosis are a time still etched raw in his mind.
“I played ball for the last 10 years of my life and it kind of seemed like a bad dream or something like that,” Telfort said. “I had a lot of sleepless nights, a lot of nights I cried — I’m not afraid to say that.”
After his diagnosis, USC made the decision to honor Telfort’s full scholarship and to allow him to remain on the field as an assistant linebackers coach. Telfort threw his full weight into the responsibility, maintaining a strong visibility in practice by offering advice, doling out criticism and getting down in the mud with his former teammates.
“I’m just an extra set of eyes,” Telfort said. “I’m looking at what my linebackers are doing. I throw in my two cents every down and when they make a mistake or something like that.”
Defensive coordinator Rocky Seto has watched Telfort’s transition from player to coach in the little time that has passed and suggested that the young man has “tremendous potential.”
“One of the things that was his strength as a player was the knowledge that he had and how much he studied,” Seto said. “Coaches have to be really into it and dig in as much as they can. He’s already done that as a player, so if he continues to dig in I foresee great things for him as a coach.”
Though Telfort said he has had little trouble adapting to the sudden distance between himself and his teammates, he admitted the transition from player to coach has forced him to shift perspectives rather quickly.
“Let’s say you get like your bell rung one play or you’re out of breath, you’re not really thinking about your plays. Whereas as a coach, you’re always thinking about plays and what the players need to do and what assignments they have,” Telfort explained.
Seto, himself only a little more than a decade removed from the game as a player, remarked that while Telfort has suffered no disrespect from the older and more experienced players, the pure newness of his situation could make things hard for him.
“It’s so hard to have that separation,” Seto said. “I remember when I first started volunteering after I got done playing, there’s still a connection with your old teammates. He’s in the transitionary phase right now, where he’s trying to learn and see what coaching’s all about.”
Outside linebacker and fellow freshman Jarvis Jones praised Telfort’s presence on the sideline, particularly the palpable energy and experience that the coach brings every day.
“He’s pushing us real hard. He’s working on our blitzes, our get-offs, our cut-blocks and everything you could think of to become a better player,” Jones said. “Frankie is a great coach. He’s got a lot of energy. He tries to push us everyday to be the best players we can be.”
Jones not only spoke highly of Telfort’s effectiveness as a coach, but also of his presence as a rallying point for the team.
“When he gives us a pregame speech, when Frankie talks everybody’s really feeling it. He’s one of the best out of us because he can’t do it,” Jones said. “He’s just trying to play through us, and we play through Frankie. I love him like a brother, and everybody really respects Frankie and what he does for us.”
When asked about his future prospects on and off the field, Telfort displayed a practicality that belied his youth, expressing his belief that education is paramount to his future.
“I’ve got to graduate first. I want to major in creative writing with a pre-med path, so I got my hands full,” Telfort said. “Hopefully I can either go to med school here or back closer to home. I guess after that there’s always the coaching option, just because I love the game.”
Earl Sims, Telfort’s former football coach at Gulliver Preparatory School in Miami, reminisced about how Telfort’s drive pushed him through those first dark days after his diagnosis.
“He was devastated, and when I asked how he felt, whether or not he was feeling homesick, whether or not he wanted to give it up and come back home, he was adamant about not coming home because he left to pursue a plan and he didn’t want to give up, even if that plan had changed,” Sims said.
Telfort’s former coach remembers the neophyte coach’s writing ability fondly, remarking that while Telfort may still be searching for the next step in the face of a brave new world, he is well-suited to rewrite his story.
“I remember saying to him ‘God never makes mistakes. This might be his will for you to move on to something else.’ Everybody has a story, and everybody builds their story by their lives,” Sims said. “Frankie’s trying to figure out how to put together his own story now.”

Trying to address concerns raised by vegan and vegetarian students last semester, USC Hospitality has begun an initiative to increase the presence and awareness of alternative food options on campus.
The project, called V2O — which stands for vegan, vegetarian and organic — has three goals: expanding healthy eating options, labeling food more accurately and giving free weekly cooking demonstrations for students.
Got milk? · Sarah Kelly (left), a freshman majoring in cinema-television production, looks on as Thomas Moran (center),  associate executive chef at USC, cooks a vegetarian dish at EVK Wednesday. The demonstration was part of an initiative that aims to increase the availability of vegetarian options. - Young Kim | Daily Trojan
The idea for V2O came about after a number of students ate tamales labeled “vegan” at Everybody’s Kitchen in April, later discovering that the tamales had been made with chicken. The incident highlighted the need for accurate marking of food in the dining halls.
“I decided then to drive culinary initiatives and accommodate everybody’s needs,” said Thomas Moran, associate executive chef at USC, who is heading the project. “We are going to reach out to get more awareness of sustainability and vegetarians.”
For the first phase of the initiative, Moran and his culinary team decided to create new vegetarian, vegan or organic menu items for EVK and Parkside Residential Kitchen. The dining halls have so far offered more than a dozen V2O dishes, including roasted eggplant, squash, organic wheat berries and different kinds of potatoes, Moran said.
He added that there are more dishes to come.
“The options are infinite,” Moran said. “We want to not just provide food, but food for people to eat.”
Elizabeth Sandoval, a sophomore majoring in communication, said the new options were helping students make better decisions when eating at the dining halls.
“In general, you want to eat healthy, but it’s harder in these buffet-style restaurants,” she said. “I think it’s a good thing to offer more options to students.”
Even so, Sandoval said she is hesitant about how different the new food will taste.
“You might be eating healthy but the trade-off might be the taste,” Sandoval said. “It’s not going to work if it’s unappetizing healthy food.”
The second part of the initiative involved the creation of labels with the V2O logo to clearly identify food at the dining locations.
“It was always being referred to [as] the vegetarian, vegan, organic initiative so we decided to simplify it to something that clearly identifies the initiative and is not a mouthful,” said Alex Maloutas, a graphic designer from the USC Design Studio who worked with the visual aspect of the initiative.
Although the labeling process will include oversight from the director and the chef at the dining locations, Moran said the responsibility of accurate marking will ultimately fall to the staff at the dining facilities.
For students like Shaila Nathu, a junior majoring in philosophy who said the only meat she eats is chicken, the labeling ensures they know exactly what is in the food.
“It’s nice to know they are being proactive and doing something to reassure [us] that they care about health standards and hospitality,” Nathu said. “In general it’s very good to know what you’re eating.”
Moran will also offer free cooking demonstration, to educate students about healthy cooking as well as provide an open forum with the chef. The demos alternate between EVK and Parkside every Wednesday.
“The classes teach people how to cook and be a part of the culinary experience,” Moran said.
Roxanne Striar, a freshman majoring in theatre who participated in the first cooking class, said she enjoyed the experience.
“I love to cook so any chance to cook and eat healthy food I [take],” she said. “It was something to do on a Wednesday night that’s inexpensive, interactive and fun.”
USC Hospitality plans to expand the V2O initiative to include other dining locations and food options on campus, according to Maloutas, who added they also have a long-term plan to label grab-and-go items.
Moran said he wants to continue to increase the variety of vegan and vegetarian options offered.
“I’m driving this initiative from a food perspective,” Moran said. “We want to provide people the most variety, and separate our university from others.”
This is so great!  Go HONVO!  I’m glad we were heard, even if Trojan Hospitality never contacted us.  I’m so excited for more vegan options!
How can we contact HONVO?  USC Blood Donor Center. Thanks.

What do ’80s exercise tapes, children’s musicals and an instructional video for a masturbation device all have in common? Seemingly nothing. But when put together, they’re all kind of funny.
Daily Trojan
Marking its fifth anniversary, the Found Footage Festival, a live comedy show and screening hosted by childhood friends Nick Prueher and Joe Pickett, returns to Los Angeles Sept. 24 to splice together clips from old VHS tapes to place a whole new comedic spin on forgotten footage.
“[The new show is] what people have grown to love,” said Pickett, co-founder of the festival. “These are exclusive videos you can’t see anywhere else.”
Like the name of the festival suggests, all the videos featured must be found either by the hosts themselves or others who submit them.
As a result, the hilarious duo, with combined credits from the Onion, The Colbert Report and The Late Show with David Letterman, can often be spotted digging through thrift stores, garage sales and even Dumpsters to find the best of the worst.
“A lot of people expect stupid Internet video, but that’s not the case at all. It’s more of a guided tour of videos that we’ve become obsessed with,” Pickett said.
“We’re curators, and we take people through a guided tour of found videos,” Prueher added.
After officially kicking off the tour in April 2004, the pair  embarked on its quest for bad footage from the beginning.
As a sophomore in high school, Prueher worked at a McDonald’s in Wisconsin, where he was intrigued by a custodial training video that he found in the fast-food restaurant’s break room. The front cover of the video claimed it featured celebrities.
“[The video] was worth popping in to see what it was all about … I just could not believe how dumb it was, especially considering the size of the corporation of McDonald’s,” Prueher said. “I got to thinking that if there were videos this dumb, sitting around in break rooms collecting dust, that there has to be more cool stuff right under our noses.”
When Prueher showed the video to Pickett, it spawned a shared lifelong obsession that has steamrolled into a full-blown comedy show, complete with prerecorded bits and live sketches.
“Stupid videos are, for whatever reason, my passion. Some people have a passion for teaching children, and mine is watching these stupid videos,” Pickett said.
Organizing the show, however, isn’t a light affair. The two have to sift through hours of tapes to find the few needles in the haystack worth playing to a general audience.
“We’re sort of masochists that way. We have a pretty high tolerance for bad video,” Prueher said. “We find that one piece of footage that … You know is bad in just the right way is what makes it worth it for us. We just can’t wait to show it to people.”
The two consider themselves brothers, with a relationship spanning decades that provides a common background, keeping them going even through the arduous month-long editing process.
“It’s a safety in numbers thing,” said Pickett. “We hold hands and we dive in headfirst.”
Highlights for the LA show include completely new footage coupled with background stories and potential guest stars.
A new segment called “Adrian’s Corner” consists of videos they procured from a previous audience member, who invited them back to his home.
They stayed up until 6 a.m. watching the bizarre video collection while also admiring his other odd collections, including Barbies and photographs of barbecues.
“It’s the greatest job in the world. You get to go around and watch stupid videos and people bring stupid videos to you,” Prueher said. “We’re not getting rich off of this by any means, but it’s just cool.”
Prueher and Pickett also attempt to contact the people featured in their show, hoping to find out the back story and to invite them to participate.
“For us, meeting a guy from the McDonald’s training video is equivalent to someone else meeting Tom Cruise,” Prueher said.
As celebrities in their own right, guest stars often have audience members lining up for their autographs and to take their pictures.
“They go from total obscurity to slightly less obscurity,” said Prueher.
Over the years, the part-film festival, part-comedy show has attracted a cult following, with one fan attending six shows in one tour.
“We’re kind of amazed that our circle of friends finds this stuff as funny as we do,” Prueher said. “It’s part of the fun, taking a video or work that can be seen in public and putting it on a screen and getting a bunch of people in a room saying, ‘It’s okay to laugh at these.’”
Eventually, the creators envision turning the show into more than just a hobby, and hope to one day replace television’s classic, America’s Funniest Home Videos.
“We’re trying to make the world’s funniest live show of all time,” Prueher joked. “Actually, we never really had any goals other than we just wanted to show our video collection to people. That makes us happy and hopefully makes people who come happy, too.”

One of the great truths in Japanese film and television is that giant robots are rarely just that. Even in the shallowest works about great machines making ruins of Tokyo, the robots are often mirrors for their pilots — grand symbols of alienation and loss in a technological age.
Based on the Japanese TV anime produced in the ’90s that grew from low-budget origins to a multimillion-dollar industry, Hideaki Anno’s pretentiously titled Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone still stands as the best use of the modern Japanese metaphor in the genre’s history.
Celestial · The Japanese film Evangelion: 1.0, based on a popular ’90s television series, tackes adolescent themes in a post-apocalyptic backdrop. The film focuses on several disaffected teenagers forced to pilot giant robots against an army of grotesque monsters attacking a futuristic Tokyo. - Photo courtesy of Eleven Arts
As a nearly identical remake of the first few episodes of Anno’s series, however, the film serves at best as an exercise in pointless nostalgia for any American anime fans who were obsessed with the series as adolescents.
The classic story: a boy is called to an underground military installation erected in the wake of a near-apocalyptic cataclysm. He is charged by the group’s leader, also his estranged father, with fighting an invading alien force called angels by piloting a giant robot, the Evangelion.
That all sounds like the plot of a technophile-soap opera, which is often what the giant robot genre boils down to. Anno’s film, however, is more poetic than any description reveals. The film opens with a classically Japanese motif: the sound of summer cicadas over the crashing of waves. But the sea of Anno’s Japan is blood-red, and this introduction to his post-apocalyptic world is stunning. Evangelion: 1.0 moves quickly from this strangely poignant moment into a grand action sequence — protagonist Shinji’s arrival in Tokyo and his subsequent battle with an angel.
These opening scenes set the pace for the film, which is essentially a series of brutal, visceral fights between bleeding, humanoid giant robots and strange alien invaders spliced together with long moments of interpersonal dilemma and technobabble-heavy exposition.
The visuals convey a poetry of movement lacking in most Japanese giant monster movies; the camera sweeps down destroyed streets and up skyscrapers to reveal more than just two great bodies playing among a modern cityscape. The scenes removed from the battleground are marked by the same thoughtful visual design. Anno employs a deep, chiaroscuro-heavy style that complements the depth of his characters.
Those characters are the film’s strongest element, but its 98 minutes barely give the supporting players the room to breathe afforded by a television series, almost assuming that a fan-filled audience doesn’t need anything more than Sparknotes. Still, Shinji and the other main characters are given long moments of contemplation, and their relationships are built effectively.
Evangelion: 1.0 retains the bitter display of adolescent alienation that made its predecessor such a hit with teenagers here and in Japan.Protagonist Shinji’s struggle to find his identity is not only personified in his difficulty manning the Evangelion, but more obviously in his interactions with mother-figure Misato and sister-figure Rei. These conflicts are charged with a palpable sexual frustration and awkwardness.
The giant robots of Evangelion themselves are a far cry from the boxy robots of Power Rangers and Voltron. Anno’s monsters cast a positively menacing gaze that is compounded by the sharp angles and grotesquely human qualities of its body — the perfect metaphor for adolescence. Watching the creature go berserk in an early scene effectively conveys an element of real, uncontrollable terror.
The question Evangelion: 1.0 begs is whether or not it will have any appeal for neophyte viewers. The film is infused with sci-fi technobabble and moves rather quickly. The overused Christian symbols — cross-shaped explosions and the angels themselves — carry an air of meaningless pretension. There’s also a bit of awkward ephebophilia — or sexual preference for mid-adolescents — toward the end of the film as we get a prolonged and unnecessary shot of Rei — who I would like to remind the filmmakers is supposed to be 14 — putting on a skintight suit.
The quality of the visuals and the universality of the characters, however, are effective selling points.
Anno, who started his career drawing the grotesque giant “warrior” in anime master Hayao Miyazaki’s 1984 classic Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, is spinning his wheels. In recycling the story, music and images from his beloved work, Anno panders to fans and almost admits that he has nothing new to say.
Evangelion: 1.0 is the first piece of a tetralogy known as Rebuild of Evangelion, the second part of which has already premiered in Japan. The trailer after the credits of Evangelion: 1.0 suggests some interesting departures from the original storyline, but perhaps it might be better for the creative team to leave these classic characters where they stand and strike out on a new venture. After all, the giant robot is a surprisingly rich metaphor; their options are positively limitless.
Have you ever watched the original series of the anime?
If you haven’t, you really won’t understand the “meaning” behind the movie at all.
The thing about this anime is that, even though you do watch the original series and the movies, you don’t understand the entire story at all. You’ll understand the superficial part, but not the whole picture.
You don’t know who is good and evil. Maybe the Evangelion is the evil and the angel is good.
And finally, Rei is not a sister-figure for Shinji. She is more like a motherly-like figure, I mean she kinda is Shinji’s mother.

It takes relatively little effort to hijack a Facebook.
A combination of convenient timing, juvenile humor and a stellar poker face is often enough to wreak virtual havoc on any unsuspecting victim, who will only come to realize all the embarrassing alterations made to their profile following a torrent of comments from confused and amused witnesses.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
It takes considerably more effort to mass produce a nearly flawless hoax — a fake issue of one of the most storied publications in history.
In a move that would make Ashton Kutcher proud, a group known as the Yes Men printed and placed into circulation 100,000 fake copies of the New York Post Monday morning. Introduced by a front-page headline screaming “We’re Screwed!” in the tabloid’s ubiquitous bold print font, the central theme of the entire phony issue was rapid climate change and environmentalism. Even the famous “Page Six” gossip column and back sports sections followed suit, discussing celebrities and athletes taking part in the “green movement.”
The group is no stranger to the identity assumption business, having punk’d The New York Times, The World Trade Organization and McDonald’s in similar fashion before. But rather than following in the reckless footsteps of garden variety identity thieves, the Yes Men seek to send a legitimate message through their satirical antics, singling out what they perceive to be irresponsible corporate actions or, in some cases, inactions, to inflict a brand of vigilante justice that protects the public.
In this case, they attempt to call out a lack of progress in the effort to find a way to curb global warming, with a UN Summit meeting leading up to the UN Climate Change Conference serving as the perfect time to make an impression.
In responding to the elaborate prank, the New York Post offered a less than rousing attack against the activists, labeling it a “limp effort” and adding that the Yes Men Post had “none of the wit and insight New Yorkers expect from their favorite paper.”
The knockout punch was proclaimed that “the Post will not be hiring any of their headline writers.”
The tepid defense was no better than that of a freshly insulted fifth-grader seeking to avoid embarrassment by telling his tormentor that he was still cooler than him.
But while the New York Post seeks to put this event behind it and resigns itself to flinging acerbic comments at the activists, such a stunt should not be treated as benignly as having one’s profile picture changed to Keyboard Cat.
For starters, the sheer magnitude of the project should be room for worry — 100,000 papers is equivalent to almost one-sixth of the tabloid’s daily circulation. In comparison, the very paper in your hands reaches just 9,000, and it’s one of the largest student-run newspapers in the nation.
In their defense, the Yes Men claim that all factual information published in their version was completely true. But had there been anything over-the-top inflammatory or controversial in the issue, there would have been a huge public outcry, and the reputation of the New York Post would be subject to a barrage of bullets from the firing squad of public opinion just by name association.
And while the egg left on the face of the New York Post may have only been the size of a quail’s this time around, they still got hit.
In an industry where profits are falling faster than a certain team’s AP poll ranking numbers, it seems curious that this event hasn’t elicited a much greater response, especially out of one of the oldest papers in the country.
Where’s the pride?
If this incident has shown anything, it’s that as much as we would like to blame the declining fortunes of the print and broadcast fields on the rapid acceleration of online media and technology, a change in philosophy appears to be just as big a contributor.
As much as they hate to admit it, the New York Post is probably extremely happy right now, as the work of the Yes Men has helped to attract an onslaught of attention and buzz. Not over their own content, mind you, but over an incident in which they played no role other than unwilling a participant.
Integrity doesn’t pay the bills anymore.
As a former print journalism major who once dreamed of being able to take a stab at turning the downward trend of the medium the other way, I’m disheartened to see that the values have shifted so drastically in a profession that has endured through revolutions, depressions and wars.
The bottom line is that every ounce of respectability has to be clawed for and protected. There are more than enough sloppy news options online.
Unfortunately, right now it doesn’t appear that this is much of a fight.
Soojin Yoon is a junior majoring in public relations. His column, “Boy Meets Word,” runs Thursdays.
And regarding your comment, “there are more than enough sloppy news options online”… uh, there are plenty of sloppy news options on your television and at your newsstand, too, my friend.
Your perspective is kind of odd. The New York Post loses respectability because a bunch of pranksters pull an elaborate, illegal stunt at their expense? It doesn’t make sense. Respect is based on what you do and how you communicate, not on what other people do to you. Juvenile pranks only bring disrespect on the pranksters.

A decade ago, when grunge bands were no longer encompassing the emotional turmoil felt by the next generation, angst-ridden adolescents sat on their bedroom floors yearning for a style of music that would provide them with some solace during the awkward, unnerving high school years.
That’s around the time that alternative rock uncovered its sensitive side, which in turn fostered bands like The Get Up Kids.
The Get Up Kids
Hailing from Kansas City, Mo., The Get Up Kids infused its music with heartrending lyrics and softer melodies to allow kids to understand exactly what “constants aren’t so constant anymore” means in their own lives.
Though The Get Up Kids formed in 1995, its debut album, Four Minute Mile, was not released onto the alternative scene until 1997. Matthew Pryor (vocalist and guitar), Ryan Pope (drums), Robert Pope (bass), Jim Suptic (guitar) and James Dewees (keyboard) recorded Something To Write Home About in 1999 — an album that not only launched their careers, but also  Vagrant Records, which later signed other popular bands like Dashboard Confessional.
Despite its success, The Get Up Kids disbanded in 2005.
Each member of the band joined other music groups to keep their skills sharp. In fact, they have all played in a handful of bands since the initial break-up, including White Whale, Spoon, Reggie And The Full Effect and My Chemical Romance.
Yet this hiatus can only last so long. The Get Up Kids is returning to the music scene, bringing that sentimental adolescent experience to a whole new audience with the re-release of the groundbreaking album that put the band on the map: Something To Write Home About.
Along with the new issuing of the record, the release features a DVD of live performances in the band’s hometown, plus seven downloadable bonus tracks from the original demos. To promote the re-release, The Get Up Kids planned a headlining tour, which kicked off in Kansas City on Sept. 11.
“We all got together when Spoon was playing in Lawrence, Kan.,” Matt Pryor said. “It was mellow and fun hanging with them, and the tension was gone — not super stressful. We talked about it and we couldn’t see why we couldn’t do it. We thought, ‘Let’s do it for fun.’”
The Get Up Kids has been doing just that since it began gearing up for the new tour. The band reunited in November 2008 to film a 50-minute DVD, where the members perform the album from beginning to end.
The DVD gives older fans a chance to reconnect and reminisce about the shows back in the day, and will give new listeners a chance to check out what the band is all about. With close, multi-camera shots and home video vibe, it gives  fans a chance to feel like they are not just watching a video of its shows, but that they are actually a part of the experience.
Pryor and the band made sure to give longtime devotees the chance to see what The Get Up Kids look like behind the scenes. It is also there to expose younger music enthusiasts, as well as people who may not have ever heard of them before to them.
“People who saw us back in the day like to come out and pretend like they’re in their 20s again,” Pryor said. “We’ve also got their brothers and sisters starting to like the band. They hear that we have influenced bands that they like, and they want to hear what we are like. I love both of these kinds of fans.
After years of turmoil within the group, it appears the members have finally found common ground.
“From an internal level, we’re more grown up about stuff,” Pryor explained. “Not getting totally hammered all the time; everyone just gets along better.”
They have been having fun getting ready for their tour and promoting their album, but will there be a new The Get Up Kids album in the near future?
Not even Pryor knows the answer to that question.
“We’ve been writing and recording off and on,” he said. “We don’t know if we’re gonna do a traditional new record or just release singles. We’re taking it light for now to see.”
He is much more inclined to talk about the tour and how excited the band members are to be back with their fans.
“We’ve been given an excuse to come out and play some shows, and we are really glad for that,” Pryor said.
While the 14-year-old uncomfortable teenager may be older and less self-conscious now, The Get Up Kids tour allows these now-adults to go back and reminisce about a more awkward time and listen to the very songs that pulled them through it.

USC Trustee Edward Roski Jr.’s proposed NFL stadium is one step closer to making its LA debut.
The city of Walnut agreed to drop its lawsuit Tuesday against the building of an NFL stadium in the neighboring City of Industry, in return for a $9 million payment deal and other incentives, the Pasadena Star-News reported.
Walnut filed the lawsuit in March against the City of Industry and Roski-chaired Majestic Realty Co., insisting the Industry City Council approved the $800 million venue without reviewing and discussing its environmental and traffic impact.
Roski and Majestic Realty lobbied extensively to persuade the California State Assembly to ease the California Environmental Quality Act on the 75,000-seat development, arguing it would create 18,000 jobs. At the time, lobbyists for Los Angeles County were ordered to work against the bill.
The state assembly then passed a bill that waived the act on Sept. 11, according to the Whittier Daily News.
When the bill reached the State Senate, the Senate decided to send it back to Industry and Majestic Realty to be negotiated with the city of Walnut.
Specifics of the settlement entail that Industry will pay Walnut $9 million for traffic improvements in the local area, as well as make an annual payment to a Walnut “community fund.” The annual payment will vary year to year, depending on how many events are held at the stadium.
Industry also assured that it will control traffic and noise around the stadium, and will employ groups of local officials to guide and control traffic on event days. Industry also said events held at the stadium will not run past 10 p.m., the Pasadena Star-News reported.
Walnut City Council members voted 3-1 Tuesday to approve the settlement.
However, the Industry City Council will vote whether or not to approve the settlement Thursday.
If Industry doesn’t approve the settlement, the Senate agreed to hold a special meeting to discuss the bill again before the end of the month, according to the Pasadena Star-News.

It’s Friday night and you decide to hit up the 9-0, The Row or a couple of random parties on Ellendale with your friends.
Waking up the next morning in the clothes from the night before, reeking of God-knows-what and not remembering exactly how your night ended is always an adventure in itself. The last thing you can clearly remember is dancing inside some sort of cage, taking shots of Patron, alcohol running down the corners of your mouth (there may have been some Smirnoff involved too) and taking gangster pictures in the bathroom. But there, lying next to you, is your glistening beacon of hope. The one thing that can help you piece together your night. Your saving grace. Your trusted cell phone.
Courageously, you decide to scroll through your outgoing calls. Crap. You had good reason to be worried about your obnoxiously drunken stupor. You called all of your exes, your boss, your current fling and your mom.
Continuing to the text messages — there it is, clear as day. Guilty again.
An astounding 55 percent of people surveyed by Virgin Mobile have experienced similar early-morning scenarios. Those surveyed said that the morning after drinking, their first impulse was to reach for their cell phone to see who they had drunk-dialed the night before.
Just as the reality and shame of the past night sets in, you begin to think: FML. With all of these technological advancements we can’t get some kind of breathalyzer system on cell phones? Am I reaching for the stars here? Why is it that alcohol and a cell phone together produce such a lethal combination of humiliation the morning after?
Technology is making it effortless for us to make fools of ourselves. The immediate communication that cell phones allow can be great when sober. But for those wild nights, cell phones become the not-so-perfect way to confess your undying love to “just a friend,” how needy you are to the person you’ve only been dating for a week or to remind your ex of what an insecure psychopath you are. Classy.
According to the Virgin Mobile survey, 95 percent of respondents claimed to have previously drunk-dialed or drunk-texted, with one-third of the calls going to an ex-lover — an ex-lover that probably wasn’t all too enthused to get a message in the wee hours of the morning.
Cell phones, when used responsibly, can be a great way to surf the web, share pictures, download music and keep in contact with family and old friends. When used with zero self-restraint, however, they operate as powerful tools of social self-destruction that foster awkwardness long after the drunken text message and/or call was sent.
Here’s the rule of thumb: If it seems like a good idea after a few drinks and it involves a cell phone, you will most likely regret it in the morning, so just say no because you want to be the exception, not the pathetic statistic.
If for some reason you absolutely can’t manage to loosen the death grip you have on your cell phone at the time of intoxication and can’t control the raging impulse within to press “Send,” then the next time you wake up on a morning after and reach for your phone, please go to fmylife.com and post your traumatic story so the rest of us can laugh at your expense.
You’ve been warned.
Nina Tyler is a junior majoring in English.
Great writing. This is so funny and true!

Safety priorities
In his Sept. 18 opinion piece, “Uptick in Campus Safety Unnoticed,” Robert Fragoza was ignorant in his opinion of the vast majority of the student population, to say the least. While I admit that I am fervently trying to forget about the $250 fine which I received after biking across an intersection near campus, I think that most students are now well aware of the newly enforced biking laws, as well as the presence of the yellow-jacketed security personnel donned in yellow jackets. Fragoza’s claim was an over-generalization, which I do not believe adequately addressed the root of this particular problem — the continued frustration from students does not stem from a lack of effort by LAPD or the Department of Safety to improve safety, but rather is a disagreement with the ranking of priorities that they have placed in regards to our safety.
The citing of bicyclists is a perfect example of why many students believe LAPD and DPS have inadequately established their priorities. Is the punishment of students who are merely trying to compete with the horrific traffic flow issue at intersections really a better use of time and money than increasing the number of armed security personnel around student housing complexes, especially at night? I believe that many students would make the argument that, in the past, outsiders to the USC community have proved to do more harm to the students than the students have done to themselves. To illustrate this point, let us consider which issue is more severe: a little bumper action between two students in the middle of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street, or a hit-and-run accident at that same location which leaves us with one of our own tragically killed?
I agree with Fragoza that USC’s decrease in the number of crimes and increase in arrests made over the past few years is a positive finding that should not go unrecognized. Certainly, increased safety measures have been effective in reducing more preventative crimes such as personal theft and burglary. However, it is the prevalence of the high-profile crimes that have earned us the reputation as the “University of South Central” and that should be of utmost concern. It seems that high-profile crimes in our campus community have not decreased in the slightest, with a shooting, stabbing and hit-and-run accident all taking place in the last year. It is time for the proper authorities to shift their focus off of more trivial matters such as bike safety and hiring unarmed security personnel onto protecting the lives of fellow Trojans.
Fragoza also made the claim that although UCLA’s student population is denser, its per capita crime rate is almost equal to ours. While I think that most Trojans would, in fact, agree that the UCLA Bruins are “denser” than we are, are we really about to compare the nature of the crimes most common in Westwood to the events that have occurred in the slums surrounding USC? It is not only irrelevant, but slightly shameful to compare a laboratory accident that killed a UCLA student to the sickening and fatal crimes that have taken the lives of USC students in cold blood. The inherent problem in this comparison surrounds the backdrop of accident versus intent.
The issue of how USC should most effectively place its priorities concerning our safety has yet to been resolved. Hopefully, it will not take one more tragic event or life lost to realize that current safety procedures are simply unsubstantial and improperly directed. Fragoza is correct in saying that old stereotypes can “die hard,” but it remains the university’s responsibility to at least “fight on” ‘til the death.

History is on USC’s side. Recent history, that is.
If anyone has learned anything from the trend of losses to inferior, unranked opponents, it’s this: One loss does not end a season. Usually.
Somehow, some way, a strange brew of events over the last three years seems to give one-loss USC a shot at getting back in the national title picture.
Last year was an odd case. The voters and computers and everything else determined that USC’s one loss was worse than Florida’s one loss.
That is, a loss on the road on a Thursday night against a good Oregon State team after a blowout win over another BCS contender was worse than a loss at home to a good Mississippi team.
Scheduling Virginia, Ohio State and Notre Dame in non-conference games apparently carries less weight than Hawaii, Miami, the Citadel and Florida State.
But I digress.
So, two out of the last three years, one loss didn’t end the Trojans’ season.
Three years ago, the 6-0 Trojans were teetering on the edge with each passing week. They beat three straight conference opponents by an average of 6.3 points before the wheels fell off in Corvallis with a 33-31 loss to Oregon State.
But that didn’t end USC’s title hopes.
No, the Trojans were back in the national title picture a few weeks later, and all they had to do was beat UCLA at their place.
13-9, and that was done. But it was the second loss — not the first — that did USC in.
What about the next year, 2007? A 4-0 USC team falls 24-23 at home to Stanford.
But with the rallying cry that one loss doesn’t decide USC’s fate, the Trojans rebound with a 20-13 victory over Arizona and a 38-0 drubbing of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., led by backup quarterback Mark Sanchez.
Only after the 24-17 loss in Eugene to Oregon were USC’s national title hopes officially laid to rest.
So how was this made possible? Let’s just say that ESPN’s college football motto is, “Every week can change the season.”
In 2006, being ranked in the top five was a curse. Texas, LSU, Notre Dame, Auburn (twice), Florida, USC (twice), West Virginia, Louisville, Michigan and Arkansas all lost in that position.
In 2007, more of the same. Appalachian State delivered the keynote address with its stunning victory over Michigan in Ann Arbor.
Florida, Oklahoma (twice), West Virginia (twice), USC, Wisconsin, LSU (twice), Cal, South Florida, Boston College, Arizona State, Ohio State, Oregon, Kansas and Missouri all lost while ranked in the top five.
See where this is going? This year, the Trojans have already been joined by Oklahoma and Oklahoma State in the top-five-teams-that-get-upset category.
Yes, the Sooners lost because quarterback Sam Bradford was injured. But the Trojans were without Matt Barkley and Taylor Mays (if you ask me, one of the more underreported reasons for losing the game) in Seattle.
Injuries played a key role in 2007, when No. 2 Oregon went to Tucson in mid-November, only to see quarterback Dennis Dixon injure his knee and the Ducks’ national title hopes disappear.
Injuries happen; they’re the great equalizer. They’re impossible to predict, and often devastating.
That’s not to say that injuries will continue to play a significant role in this season’s title game chase, just that they might. They’ve happened before, and they can happen again.
So recent history is on USC’s side. But the history being written right now? Not so much.
The Trojans still have to run the gauntlet of ranked Pac-10 opponents on the road, which doesn’t even take into account the game in South Bend in a month.
They have to do with inexperience at quarterback, youth on defense (although that has yet to be an issue) and problems on special teams (which is a topic for an entire story itself).
So can it be done? Yes. The chips have been in place before. But will it be done? Let’s just say that a lot has to happen.
Luckily for USC, a lot has happened in the past.
“Thrilla on Manilla Paper” runs every other Thursday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Grant at tunkel@usc.edu.
Grant, Grant, Grant. I am disappointed. Did you do any homework before you wrote this article?
First off: introductions. I am an SEC fan who attends USC. Let me just start out by saying I love this school. I love the city, the people, and my department is highly respected around the world. But one thing that I simply can’t get past is this football nonsense. Granted, being an SEC fan all my life makes me a little biased, especially against USC. But this past weekend proved many things. Before reading this, I knew that it proved that the media darlings of USC were, yet again, overrated. However, after reading this and many similar articles, and having heard the talk on the street, I now know that it also proves USC will always rebound after a loss–with a tedious list of whiny excuses that championship teams simply shouldn’t make. This is the first time I’ve been in L.A., and needless to say, the first time I’ve ever witnessed a patented USC meltdown up close and personal. It was pathetic. The whining and excuse-making is unparalleled. Maybe some of you should go through high school again.
I wish Barkley would have played, I really do. Know why? Because SC would still have lost. And in that scenario, the excuses being thrown around would have been, “Barkley is a true freshman, he’s still new to the game.” SC was outplayed, bottom line–by a team that went 0-12 last year. Championship teams don’t lose to unranked teams annually. SC does. Give me a break, and give it a rest.
Let’s break down this gem: “Scheduling Virginia, Ohio State, and Notre Dame in non-conference games apparently carries less weight than Hawaii, Miami, Citadel and Florida State.”
Seriously? Ohio State? We ARE talking about the same Ohio State that got blown out by SEC teams two years in a row, right? The one that struggled to beat NAVY this year? And what’s this, you’re also citing Notre Dame in your favor? Notre Dame is perhaps the only team who rivals USC in terms of being overrated. This is a team who also lost to Michigan State, North Carolina, Pittsburgh, Boston College and Syracuse all in the same year. So remind me, how does this strengthen your argument? And VIRGINIA? Nice try, but I think you’re confusing them with the more formidable Virginia Tech, who also has a funny tendency to never live up to expectations (remember that LSU game?). The Virginia you’re talking about works against your argument, considering they went 5-7 that year. We all know that if Virginia’s joke of a football team ceased to exist tomorrow, only a small fraction of college football fans would even notice. Furthermore, your stab at Florida’s non-conference games is semi understood, but is there a reason you refuse to discuss conference games? Oh, right. Because you must know that Florida actually played 3 games against top 10 teams that year. USC played…. how many? Do you even know? If anyone is ever foolish enough to argue that USC is better than a top-notch SEC team, they should be advised to NEVER mentioning scheduling, and hope that the person who they’re arguing with is just as foolish as they are. Year in and year out, USC has one of the cushiest schedules in the country.
Quit making USC out to be a martyr. USC’s football team’s worst enemy is, quite simply, its inadequacy. Perhaps if USC would stop scheduling overrated media darlings like themselves, they’d get some credit from people who actually know what they’re talking about. But then again, scheduling overrated media darlings is the secret to USC’s success and winning records. Oh, by the way, it wouldn’t hurt if USC would actually stop losing to unranked teams. I swear, this is the only football program in the country that will lose to Oregon State and Stanford in the same year and still argue that they’ve earned any semblance of a right to call themselves BCS contenders.
Oh, my favorite sentence of the article: “The Trojans still have to run the gauntlet of ranked Pac-10 opponents on the road.” Is that a joke? What is this “gauntlet” you speak of? Cal is the only ranked team (#6) USC has left. And let’s be honest, California is not the number 6 team in the country. They never are. History proves that Cal is a good team, but not a great team by any means (they’ve gone 16-14 in the last two seasons). It’s almost like the author of this article wasn’t really thinking about what he was writing, because he expects most people who read this article to be idiots.
History is on USC’s side. You bet it is. Historically, USC plays one, MAYBE two above-average teams a year–the rest of the schedule is laughable. I’d love to see the look on Pete Carroll’s face if he had to play Alabama and LSU regularly. Bottom line, USC can moan and complain til the end of time. Consider yourselves lucky, because you’d be getting 4+ losses a year in the SEC.

Los Angeles residents love their cars. From beaten-up Durangos to two-door Maseratis, Angelenos form a symbiotic relationship with what they drive, refusing to separate from their leather seats and dashboards cluttered with plastic figurines.
Not long ago, Angelenos even watched movies from their cars.
They didn’t do it in the way that some children now watch The Wiggles in high definition in the back of their mothers’ stylish SUV, sipping organic apple juice in between yoga and art lessons.
They parked. They bit their nails. They may have even necked — but only during the boring parts, of course.
The humble drive-in theater may be a symbol of the postwar generation that spent its disposable income on hot rods, diners and sockhops, but some car-only theaters still exist — even in trendy Los Angeles.
Vineland Drive-In Movie Theater, located in the City of Industry, is one of the celluloid stragglers refusing to become obsolete. Housing five screens, the theater plays double features each night for $8 per ticket. Filmgoers choose their screen, drive with low headlights and pick one row of raised pavement to claim as their own.
Each screen has its own radio station, which pipes the movie’s dialogue to hundreds of minivans, sports cars and trucks, all filled with reclining, noisy patrons crunching on homemade snacks. Viewers won’t be graced with hyper-detailed picture quality or THX sound, but rather a slightly gray, pocked version of a film accompanied by a surround-sound score privy to interference from a neighboring car’s giant tin cooler filled with soda cans.
These details are forgivable, though. It’s a kind of no-frills leisure activity that keeps comfort and independence in mind, an experience for the restless among us who like to walk around during a film or drive from screen to screen in search for the perfect movie to watch with bare feet propped up on the dashboard.
A pairing of Sorority Row and Inglourious Basterds matched the periphery of industrial wasteland surrounding Vineland — and everyone from small children to middle-aged men felt at ease grasping onto their mothers and wives during the suspenseful bits.
The drive-in sits in a strange part of California — long asphalt roads, seemingly vacant storage spaces and looming warehouses broken up by veins of train tracks with clanking passenger cars that look just as archaic as Vineland. The washed-out, dated concession stands serve the usual popcorn and soda, but seem irrelevant because moviegoers can bring all the food they need.
Around the concession stands is the only place where all the drive-in attendees converge outside the safety of their cars. Mostly, it’s full of families clutching blankets lined up for the restrooms. One such group — two boys in matching plaid pajamas with their babysitting aunt — sipped juice outside during intermission.
“I love it here because it’s comfortable and cheaper than other places,” Ashley Gonzalez, a student at Whittier College, said as she hugged her nephews Carlos, 7, and Derek, 4.
There to watch Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, the boys needed the soda to prepare for their next conquest: Halloween 2. When asked if they were going to close their eyes, Carlos and Derek quickly responded, “No!”
As bathroom-goers rush back to their cars to catch the second feature, one can’t help but wonder what used to be here at this junction of Amtrak, projections, 18-wheelers and towering palm trees. Was it dusty, gray-washed chaparral wasteland dotted by spotted lizards and big rocks? A Wild West ghost town, vestiges of an untamed frontier for the unashamed and the unabashed?
Now there is only a giant parking lot whose day job is holding a swap meet, an ethereal place that changes when the sun sets and creates magic out of misery, entertainment out of simplicity, something out of nothing — and it all takes place within the very entity that conquered the empty West, making it hospitable to human beings: the car. Places like Vineland serve as old-fashioned reminders of that change.
The drive-in represents what movies did to the entire county — a desert terrain transformed into a lucrative, Hollywood machine that creates other worlds and alternate realities with a camera and some hardworking company folk zooming around the valleys with the help of good old Henry Ford.
Now, that same business seems to value exploding robots in 3-D. That’s not what the joy of movies originated from, the wonder that places like Vineland attempts to preserve. Going to the drive-in is a vestige of a time where escape could only come from being outside, a shared space near others of similar mindset.
Another Southern California drive-in theater, the Skyline Drive-In in Barstow, closed this past year. The closure hints at the drive-in’s role as the aging starlet in the Hollywood pantheon, stripped of all glamour and respect and valued for its cheapness. No amount of pancake makeup can cover up its deepening wrinkles and lagging profits.
But until the practice finally dies of natural causes, there will still be stubborn Angelenos finding spots on the lot for themselves and their precious cars.
Clare Sayas is a junior majoring  in public relations. Her column, “Lost & Found,” runs Thursdays.
Clare,  I found your article informative and I would add, the drive-in theatres also gave/give a large family a place to go and see movies for reasonable costs. When you have to pay out anywhere from $7.00-$10.00 per ticket to see one movie and sit thru unnecessary tv commericals, a drive-in is definitely a plus. Thankfully, we still many here in Kentucky and they do get used alot. What you should write about is WHY the movie theaters can get away with charging adult prices on children as they currently do. This, to me, is a real issue and it is totally an unfair pricing scheme.  Thank you for your article.  Janice. (Class of 63)
