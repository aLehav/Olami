Monday, USC community members participated in the second-ever University Forum to discuss topics such as communication, connectivity of campus stakeholders and well-being. With many senior administrators in attendance like President Carol Folt and Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp, the event provided a unique opportunity to directly communicate with key decision-makers on campus. 
The event also allowed students, faculty and staff at all levels to come together in a shared space to discuss topics important to our Trojan Family. In a time of key administrative change at USC, creating a space for all stakeholders to freely voice their opinion and provide leaders with specific input is imperative in moving forward from a couple turbulent years. 
The Trojan Council brings together the presidents and vice presidents of the four central governing bodies on campus: the Undergraduate Student Government, the Graduate Student Government, the Staff Assembly and the Academic Senate. Aside from our routine work to address issues of mutual concern, our group also prioritizes hosting community-wide events that provide opportunities for discussion between students, faculty and staff, including senior administrators. 
With commitment to our constituencies to take their feedback from the Forum and drive improvement across USC, the Trojan Council will continue to regularly meet to further establish our collective priorities and critically create concrete plans of action for each of our organizations. 
As the Trojan Council begins the process to build these priorities and plans, for the time being, I would like to take the opportunity to directly respond to a few of last night’s main topics by reflecting on my own personal summaries, rather than those of the Trojan Council at large.
Staff Assembly President Erika Chesley started the forum’s discussion by asking audience members their thoughts on the effectiveness of University communication and where all of us can improve when and how we communicate. Many voiced their frustrations with departmental decentralization and an unclear vision for the University, causing a lack of awareness of resources, particularly for students and their parents and not knowing where to provide day-to-day feedback. Many members expressed their wishes to move past listening sessions and have more-established spaces for direct engagement with senior USC decision-makers. 
In alignment with the Trojan Council’s mission to align students, staff, faculty and other stakeholders in the governance of the University, many participants last night brought up concerns about the siloed nature of USC’s schools and campuses. Despite our positioning as a research institution, representatives at the Health Sciences Campus voiced their concerns about the lack of databases available for individuals to connect and engage in dialogue about their topic of expertise. Moreover, graduate students across different campuses expressed worry about their access to administrators and decision-making tables that are generally concentrated at the University Park Campus. 
Many contributors also noted a need for increased University support for the Student Health Center and many of its programs — Counseling and Mental Health, Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and general medical care. One attendee noted the new fall break for students as a way to support their well-being and shared their hopes for a similar break for staff. There was also extensive conversation on the impact of lack of food, housing and financial insecurity on well-being, particularly for students and staff. Additionally, with the rising costs of tuition and living expenses, many in our community are struggling to pay for basic needs, which impacts their well-being and ability to thrive. 
Many other concerns, suggestions and questions were raised by those in attendance, including student worker support systems, discrimination and diversity, accountability and compliance, transfer and spring admit student inclusion, collaboration with future stakeholders regarding sustainability and increased support and awareness of community needs from the Board of Trustees.
In response to all of these details, the Trojan Council’s four governing bodies will use the input to shape our meetings with decision-makers on campus. Aside from this, it was also encouraging to see many senior administrators not only in attendance but actively taking notes throughout the event. In conversations with some of them following the forum, they expressed their gratitude for the feedback and eagerness to work on improvements in their departments. 
Moving forward, the feedback will help guide campus priorities with the aim to improve the University for all. As USG president, I pledge to double down on resource awareness and accessibility, expanding relationships between USC stakeholders and working to make sure students, staff and faculty are safe and appreciated as a part of the larger Trojan Family. 
Thank you to all those who attended the University Forum, and I urge you to continue to voice your input as USC looks toward the future. If you were unable to attend the event but would still like to provide input, I encourage you to email me at usgpres@usc.edu or stop by the USG office, TCC 224. Every voice deserves to be heard in this time of transition as we collectively work to improve both the University at large and the culture of the Trojan Family.

The Newman Recital Hall will swell with visual art and sounds Tuesday from the Visions and Voices showcase, “Paths of Glory, Visions of Horror: The Music and Art of World War I.”
History professor emerita Elinor Accampo and Strings Department Chair Ralph Kirshbaum will discuss their plans for the event commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles. They hope to bring together an eclectic showcase of emerging genres and student artists that will inspire audiences to contemplate the conflicting ideas that arose in the wake of World War I.
The production will begin with an introduction by Kirshbaum followed by student performances and short conversations on art pieces selected from this period directed by Accampo. Together, these conversations and performances will take audience members through the glory and horror of the First World War. Talented musicians from the Thornton School of Music will present evocative instrumental movements written by composers entrenched within American culture during the war.
“[The Paths of Glory concert and the following Piatigorsky Festival] are expressions, I would say, of the range of musical emotions that one can generate and capture on this great instrument — on the cello,” Kirshbaum said. “This program is something that’s been on my mind for many, many years … there had been wars and battles and so forth, but not of the nature of the First World War. And so it’s called the Great War for a reason.”
At the end of the First World War, musicians and visual artists all over Europe began to respond to changes they had seen in their countrymen’s ideals. During this period, militant drumbeats flanked the background of artists’ compositions, and jazz seeped its way into many of the pieces that will be performed Tuesday night. To illustrate a period of change, Kirshbaum notes that these composers’ works coexisted in an age of uncertainty not unlike our own.
“The point is that the composers who are being highlighted in this program all had varying degrees of profound reflections on their own lives and their creative being as a result of the First World War,” Kirshbaum said. 
Composer Maurice Ravel and painter-printmaker Otto Dix will be featured in the program. Both pioneers in their field, they knew only that they had to express something of the horrors they had witnessed on the battlefield or on the home front to get an emotional response from their audiences. Yet producing deeply emotional art does not come without risk; Kirshbaum connects this uncertainty to the need for disciplines in the arts today. 
“Is there a place for the arts in our modern society? … I think there’s more need for it now than ever,” Kirshbaum said. “The more that life excludes the beauty and the profundity of the arts, in my estimation, the more sterile that life is, no matter how successful it might be on other levels. And I think it’s that that degree of detachment from what is best and profound in humanity is what leads us to the kind of political upheavals that we’re seeing all over the world now.”
Kirshbaum and Accampo have been planning this program, which serves as a “prelude” to the March 2020 quadrennial Piatigorsky International Cello Festival, since last fall.
“As I taught World War I, I became very aware of the art that was produced before, during and after the war and how it really represented the cultural changes that were going on that in part led to war,” Accampo said. “I am [also] talking about the culture that preceded World War I — that made a lot of people accept violence and much of the age of mechanization … this age of machines and mechanization gave rise to this worship of speed and acceptance of violence. And so I want to raise the question: ‘Are we going through a similar age today with digitalization?’” 
Allan Hon, a doctoral candidate studying violoncello performance, has been preparing a piece by English composer Frank Bridge.
“I study with Andrew Shulman [principal cellist with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and adjunct associate professor at Thornton], and he’s been wanting me to play this piece for a while, and so when [Kirshbaum] talked to him about the possibility of programming it … Andrew thought that this would be a great piece for me to put together,” Hon said. 
Kirshbaum said the evening event is an opportunity for students to take advantage of an interdisciplinary collaboration between the visual and musical arts. The concert also allows visitors a glimpse at the grit and skill Thornton doctorate students have to offer. 
“You have the opportunity … to hear their fellow students play at a very high level,” Kirshbaum said. “What a cello can produce, from the most profound and sonorous notes in the lower register of the instrument to high-soaring, piercing sounds to very dry, rhythmic, percussive sounds — all of those things put together by a great composer create a very unique kind of impression.”
Doors for “Paths of Glory, Visions of Horror” open at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday.

On Oct. 15, the Association of American Universities released the results of a national survey looking at campus climate around sexual assault and sexual misconduct among 33 member universities. The results show that approximately one-third of undergraduate women at USC have experienced at least one incident of nonconsensual sexual contact involving physical force or inability to consent since starting school. On college campuses, sexual assault and sexual misconduct is not just a problem — it is a public health epidemic. 
To better understand the crisis at hand, it is essential to first know the discrepancies among the definitions of sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual violence. Incidents of sexual assault and sexual violence involve a person not consenting or being unable to consent to physical sexual activities. However, sexual assault is more likely to be used to discuss individual cases of misconduct, while sexual violence implies a more global scale. 
Sexual harassment can fall under the umbrella of sexual assault, as it can involve unwanted sexual advances or sexual requests in addition to verbal or physical conduct of sexual nature. Lastly, sexual misconduct is an overarching term that refers to any form of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual violence and stalking. 
It is important to note that these terms are not synonymous to each other. Sexual assault, sexual harrassment, sexual miconduct and sexual violence are nuanced terms that are distinctive within their usage. 
According to an analysis piece by The Washington Post, USC has the highest rates of female undergraduates experiencing nonconsensual sexual touching and nonconsensual sexual contact of any of the 33 universities that participated in the survey. Approximately 25% of female undergraduates report nonconsensual sexual touching, and 31% report nonconsensual sexual contact — and these statistics are from only those who chose to report the incidents. The Department of Justice indicates that the underreporting rate of sexual assault on college campuses is about 90%. 
Although USC reports some of the highest rates of sexual assault on campuses, universities around the country are all struggling with sexual assault on campuses as well. 
Because of the nature of this crisis on college campuses, it is time to shift the way people talk about sexual assault. Similarly to a wide-reaching outbreak of a disease, acts of sexual assault have physical, financial and emotional costs. For instance, a study on the effects of sexual victimization on suicidal ideation shows that one in four rape victims, compared to one in 20 non-victim women, have engaged in a suicidal act. 
Moreover, 94% of women experience symptoms of PTSD after an assault, and 30% of all cases of PTSD in the United States are caused by sexual assault. Suicide and PTSD are only two of the many consequences of sexual assault, and the impacts of sexual abuse on survivors vary on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, it is time to stop calling acts of sexual assault on college campuses a problem and instead approach them as part of an urgent public health epidemic. 
On the bright side, USC is aware of the gravity of the crisis and is responding to areas in which the University showed deficits in the survey results. For instance, the number of students who are “very knowledgeable” of campus resources to help victims of sexual assault has decreased substantially from 2015 to 2019. 
In an NPR interview, Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman at USC Student Health acknowledges this decline and introduces a newly established, in-person component of the University’s sexual assault training program for incoming first-year students. According to Van Orman, the addition aims to increase overall knowledge of campus resources among students. 
All first-year students at USC are now required to participate in a workshop called Trojans Respect Consent. The session takes place during their first semester in groups of about 15 students. The interactive worshop extends the sexual assault education curriculum into the academic year and helps sustain the conversation around safe practices. In addition to starting the discussion around sexual assault, the workshop exposes students to the different on-campus resources available in the cases that they or someone they know has been sexually assaulted. 
It is important to remember that sexual assault on college campuses in not an isolated issue — it is intrinsically linked to other crises in the world today, such as the revelations of Harvey Weinstein’s behavior that launched the #MeToo movement online. 
If changes on campus are not made, acts of sexual violence may continue to permeate throughout society and lead to other issues, such as increased sexual violence in the workplace. Therefore, by addressing the problem at the university level, USC is creating and offering comprehensive resources that teach students to recognize and potentially stop dangerous situations in their tracks. 
The University is pioneering new ways to educate students on this multifaceted issue, and other universities should change their sexual assault education programs to meet their own specific campuses’ needs as well. Although the results of the survey are upsetting, they are facilitating a much-needed dialogue around this public health crisis and will hopefully lead to institutional change to create a safer society for people in college, the workplace and beyond.

Sometimes a change in scenery is what an athlete needs to reach their full potential. We’ve seen it time and time again in professional sports — Randy Moss solidifies himself as a Hall of Famer on the Patriots; LeBron James wins his first championship in Miami; James Harden becomes an MVP-caliber player in Houston. However, leaving one program for another is still considered somewhat taboo at the college level, and this comes at the expense of the players.
On the whole, administrators and NCAA rulemakers are slowly accepting the notion of a player leaving their school for another in college football (and basketball for that matter). This spring, the NCAA loosened many of its regulations against transfers playing immediately for their new schools.
This is a good thing. In many cases, college football recruiting can mislead high-level recruits as to what their role on a team or experience at a school will be. Far too often, players arrive at a school and ride the bench for two to three seasons after being told they’d have a “chance” to start right away. What they weren’t told, however, was that that chance is usually slim to none.
Why bring this up now? Well, several transfers have set the college football world ablaze this season. In particular, LSU redshirt senior Joe Burrow, Ohio State sophomore Justin Fields and Oklahoma senior Jalen Hurts are all quarterbacks who have become Heisman favorites after being cast aside at their previous schools.
Hurts graduated from the University of Alabama last spring after going 26-2 as a starter. You’d think this would be a reasonably happy end to a college career, but not in this case. Hurts had been riding the bench behind junior Tua Tagovailoa since the National Championship game following the 2017 season, and he had one year of eligibility left. 
Thus, he followed the storied path of Sooners quarterbacks Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray and transferred to Oklahoma to learn under head coach Lincoln Riley. The result? More than 2,000 yards through the air and 700 on the ground thus far. What’s better? He’s resurrected his NFL chances at Oklahoma, and he’s on pace to have his best season yet.
Fields was one of the most highly rated recruits ever coming out of high school, and he committed to his hometown Georgia Bulldogs at the beginning of his senior year with the impression that he’d be able to compete with then-sophomore quarterback Jake Fromm for the starting job in 2018. Even after Fromm won the job, Fields believed he’d receive significant snaps throughout the season. In reality, Fields never had a real chance to dethrone Fromm, and the offense used his talents sparingly, if ever.
Fields transferred to Ohio State in the spring following the departure of current Washington Redskins quarterback Dwayne Haskins. Thus far, he’s been nothing short of electric for the undefeated Buckeyes, throwing 22 touchdowns and rushing for another eight.
Burrow, however, is the most compelling of the three. After riding the bench for two years at Ohio State behind former quarterback J.T. Barrett, Burrow battled Haskins for the starting job. After learning that Haskins would start, Burrow transferred to LSU in May 2018.
Burrow’s first year in Baton Rouge was a moderate success; he was a key offensive player for a team that won the Fiesta Bowl. But this year, Burrow has been simply unstoppable through the air, throwing for more than 300 yards in six of his eight games. If LSU stays undefeated, or if Burrow keeps up his production, the Heisman Trophy is his — plain and simple.
What makes all of these players’ stories so compelling is that there was no guarantee that any of their situations would pan out. It’s a potentially life-changing gamble, especially for those players who see football as their future. There are other transfer quarterbacks — like Missouri graduate Kelly Bryant and Washington junior Jacob Eason — who have resurrected their NFL dreams after being shunted aside at their previous schools, but these three have proven more than any others that, sometimes, all you need is a second chance.
As a college transfer myself, the pursuit of a better situation than the one you chose originally is near and dear to my heart. Again, there’s no guarantee you’ll find what you’re looking for in a new environment. In fact, it might even be worse, and there’s just no way to find out until it’s too late.
That’s why it’s always heartwarming to see transfers balling out on their new teams. For a select few players, transferring can be the opportunity that changes the trajectory of an entire career. For others, it’s a second chance to prove one’s talents in the game they love.
Sometimes, the grass actually is greener on the other side. Just ask Hurts — he’s waited a long time for an opportunity like this.

Coming off a pair of conference wins against Oregon State and Oregon, USC women’s volleyball managed to upset No. 15 Cal 3-1 before narrowly losing 3-2 to Stanford this past weekend.
The Trojans came out strong in their first set against Cal Friday, allowing only one tie and no lead changes en route to a 11-0 run to win the set.
In the second set, senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier shined, notching six kills. Lanier totaled 26 kills and 28 points on the match, matching her career-high in both categories. She continues to shred opposing defenses and has been a key leader and performer for the Trojans this season.
Lanier said she would not have been as successful against Cal  without her middle line.
“I have Raegan [LeGrand] and Jenna [Adams] behind me,” she said. “That’s one of the biggest things. They give me the confidence that even when I’m having an off night blocking, it’s not going to kill us and we’re not going to lose a game off of one skill. So I think that’s the biggest thing — just having confidence in each other.” 
The Trojans finished off the Bears 25-19 in the fourth set, riding on eight kills from Lanier. Along with Lanier’s firepower, Cal’s 32 errors in the game — compared to 12 for USC — were a major factor in the Trojans coming out on top.
The Trojans can draw a number of positives from the match. Sophomore setter Raquel Lázaro once again showed her ability to consistently produce for the Trojans with 43 assists on the night. She has dished out at least 33 assists in all of her matches so far and has been one of the Trojans’ biggest impact players. 
Following its decisive win against Cal, USC attempted to ride the wave of momentum into its match against Stanford Sunday.
Once again, the Trojans started out the match hot, winning the first two sets to put Stanford in a deep hole. Supported by explosive runs and consistent kills, the Trojans held a commanding two-set lead heading into the third.
However, No. 2 Stanford finally settled down and began to take over the match. Led by freshman outside hitter Kendall Kipp’s 23 kills, Stanford proceeded to pick apart the Trojans and won three straight sets in dominating fashion to capture the match. Despite their lackluster start, the Cardinal outplayed USC both offensively and defensively, out-blocking the Trojans 12 to 10 and putting up 75 kills compared to USC’s 57.
Lanier said there are still a few things that the Trojans must work on to be the team they want to be.
“We’re still trying to nitpick some things, fine-tune some things, and it’s getting better every day, every practice, so if we can just keep rolling with that,” Lanier said.
This loss marks USC’s seventh in a row against Stanford, but the Trojans will have at least one more chance to get revenge when they visit the Cardinal later this season.

Following its second conference defeat against Cal, No. 7 USC women’s soccer bounced back with a decisive 3-0 win over No. 19 Washington State Thursday before losing momentum in a 2-0 loss to Washington Sunday.
The Trojans dominated the Cougars offensively, putting up 17 shots, nine of which were on goal. Once again, it was forwards junior Tara McKeown and sophomore Penelope Hocking who were able to find the back of the net.
McKeown netted 2 goals in the first half to achieve her fourth brace of the season. Her first goal came less than five minutes into the game, and she followed with another less than 15 minutes later. Hocking scored the lone goal of the second half off a long assist from redshirt junior forward Samantha Bruder to ice the game for the Trojans.  
The WSU game was also          redshirt  junior goalkeeper Kaylie Collins’ first start since August. Collins made three saves and notched her third shutout on the year in only five games.
Although beating WSU was an important victory, USC was unable to replicate its performance against the Cougars’      in-state neighbors. The Trojans’                  2-0 defeat marked their third Pac-12 loss and second home defeat of the season.  
Washington scored off a long assist that left Collins in a tough one-on-one situation as well as a long free kick that soared out of Collins’ reach and hit the upper left corner.  
Washington is by no means a weak team. The Huskies have beaten a number of ranked opponents — including Cal, Arizona and TCU — and are likely to be ranked after their win over the Trojans. They have also competed in close games against powerhouses like UNC and UCLA.  
Washington’s experience against stronger opponents appeared to pay off, as the Trojans’ offense was unable to find the back of the net.  
“I thought we were very disconnected from the opening whistle,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “I give a lot of credit to the Huskies. They did what they planned to do. We didn’t execute well … and they capitalized [on that].”  
The Washington defense shut out the Trojans and turned defense into offense for their 2 goals on the day. Although USC put up 13 shots compared to six for Washington, the Huskies’ senior goalie Siena Ruelas remained strong in the net, saving all nine shots on goal. Meanwhile, Collins only posted one save. 
“Washington did a much better job organizationally with their defending and their back line than did Washington State,” McAlpine said. “I also thought we didn’t catch the breaks … with every blocked shot, with every miss, they gained energy and we lost it, and so I thought that was a big part of the problem today.”  
This loss will be particularly costly for the Trojans going forward, as USC and Washington were tied for second in the conference rankings entering the game. Now sitting at 5-3 in the conference, the Trojans can afford no more mistakes.  
“Every team in our conference is a tough opponent,” McAlpine said. “If you show up and you don’t bring the proper energy and intensity to the game, then you can get beat.”  
USC will travel north to face both Oregon and Oregon State this weekend before returning to Los Angeles for its final regular season game against crosstown rival UCLA.

On Wednesday night, brilliant blue lights bathed The Forum and the phrases “Kanye West” and “Jesus is King.” Nearly 10 or 12 thousand people filled the Inglewood venue for the premiere of Kanye West’s ninth studio album and a screening of his first IMAX film, both titled “Jesus is King,” at a free event dubbed “Jesus is King Album & Film Experience.” 
Upon arrival, attendees were required to secure their phones in Yondr pouches with locks, allowing people to remain in possession of their phones without accessing them to prevent recording of the unreleased material.
“At first, I didn’t mind the phone cases just because I was like, ‘OK cool, trying to keep people present and whatnot,’ but then I started to get really frustrated and flustered because [of] the fact that I didn’t know what time it was, and there were no clocks in there,” said Pilar Lee, a freshman majoring in journalism.
As hundreds of fans filed onto the floor of The Forum, they made their way through arrangements of tall potted plants while sounds of chirping crickets and running water played overhead. A gargantuan screen towered over the crowd, placed on the far side of the floor from the entrance. This was the first time Kanye incorporated this immersive element into the show, a collaboration with multimedia artist Meg Webster.
Kanye made his appearance near 8:30 p.m., flanked by family members and collaborators alike, to announce that about half the people were still waiting outside — but eventually the house lights went down and the film began.
Directed by Nico Ballesteros, the film featured several short scenes interspersed with verses from the Bible on-screen. “Jesus is King” aimed to capture the Sunday service experience on screen. Dozens of choir singers wearing matching uniforms of oversized, chestnut-colored T-shirts and sweatpants poured their souls into performances of gospel hymns. The film was enigmatic.
One stunning scene featured the camera looking up through a circular skylight, as one of the choir members vigorously conducted his congregation above it. The final shot was of a man holding a child, the image detailed enough to make out the cracks in his skin and the little wisps of hair on the baby’s head.
The film ran for half an hour. Then, armed with just his laptop, a microphone and a few members of his security detail, Ye geared up to play the album — church was almost in session.
He descended into the crowd and set up atop a small platform near the right side of the screen, standing upon one of the patches of grass. Fans swarmed toward the pseudo-stage, stopping at nothing to get a better view. Many attendees balanced precariously on the potted plants, while others pushed together like sardines to get as close as possible. 
“It had a whole different energy versus if you were at a concert ’cause I think you’re expecting them to perform, but with this, you were just experiencing it with him, so it was really cool,” Lee said. “He just seemed very down-to-earth, like, ‘Yeah, this is cool; this is cool. Yeah, I’m vibing with you.’ The energy in the room was great. I really enjoyed it.” 
While West has incorporated religion in his music since his first studio album, “The College Dropout,” with his early hit “Jesus Walks,” this album is by far his most explicitly religious to date. The sonic hallmark of “Jesus is King,” which will likely come as no surprise given the album’s title, is its gospel overtones. 
This album is rife with choir vocals and interpolations of church hymns, while scant with the rap features that have typically colored his previous releases. He departs from the line of the fractured experimental production he was pursuing with “Yeezus,” “The Life of Pablo” and “ye,” while retaining the grandiosity found in “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.” 
Lyrically, Kanye raps extensively about his newfound faith, referencing specific passages of scripture. He also continues his investigation of fame, at one point spitting, “I was looking at the ‘Gram and I don’t even like likes / I was screaming at my Dad, he told me, ‘It ain’t Christ-like’” on “Follow God.” 
Although this was the first time West played the final version of the album in public, many of the fans were familiar with the music and sang along to tracks that had been leaked weeks before. This didn’t seem to bother the artist, who smiled from ear to ear when people sang along to tracks like “Closed On Sunday,” in which he references Chick-fil-A and “Use This Gospel,” the Clipse- and Kenny G-assisted track featured prominently in the film’s closing sequence, marked by its anthemic “oh, oh, oh” melody.
“When he was doing his leaked songs, and I knew the lyrics from the leaked songs and the other people didn’t, I felt like I was more connected,” said Ben Lasky, a freshman majoring in music industry.
During his performance, West debuted a prototype for a new technology that he told the crowd he’s wanted to make since “Yeezus,” which released in 2013. He controlled the audio with a pocket-sized remote that allowed him to manipulate, in real time, volume and effect levels for individual stems, or discrete groups of audio tracks such as vocals or drums. He attempted to alter the songs in response to the audience’s reaction, creating a dynamic, reflexive experience. 
However, the device seemed to still have a few kinks to work out. Many songs, most notably “Follow God,” were stopped in the middle, only to restart from the beginning several times, disrupting the seamlessness of the listening experience.
“The transitions were my only issue,” said Rahul Manwani, a freshman majoring in animation who attended the event. “They were very abrasive and abrupt. That’s his whole thing — he’s very volatile and in and out of pockets of music. He would go from an 808 trap beat, rapping hard, to him, Ty Dolla $ign and The-Dream and a whole choir harmonizing. It was a bit jarring at times, but the gospel sections were gorgeous, they really hit.”

Dance runs in Rachel Harris’ blood. She hails from a family of professional dancers and loves the beautiful art and technical skill dancing requires. 
A senior at the Kaufman School of Dance, Harris knew early on that dance would play a major role in her life once she started taking dance lessons as a 2-year-old. While Harris was encouraged to dance by her mother, the art quickly transformed from a hobby into a necessity for Harris.
“I really just fell in love with it, so I danced on a competition team from outside of school for the majority of my life,” Harris said. “I wanted to keep studying it and fall more and more in love with it.” 
Harris caught the attention of the Black Student Assembly, which recently named her its October Artist of the Month. With this honor, she has been given the opportunity to showcase her work on BSA’s extensive platforms, such as the BSA Creative Experience Instagram page, promotional videos and marketing material geared toward a supportive and influential BSA alumni base.
Harris said she is excited to receive this honor since she has been a member of BSA since her freshman year. 
“Honestly, it makes me feel really esteemed and really appreciated,” Harris said. “Especially in October, in midterms season, there’s a lot of running around … It’s nice to know that I have a platform of people I know that are there to support and promote me and what I’m doing, especially as a senior because BSA has so many followers.” 
Fellow BSA member Caleb Griffin, a senior majoring in art, is a vocal supporter of Harris. Griffin, who met Harris in a Bible study during their freshman year, described Harris as “funny, talented, empathetic and compassionate.” 
“I think she mostly has begun mastering what she was already really great at coming in,” Griffin said. “It was a transformation seeing in perfection and execution and just falling in love confidently with what she’s doing and applying it in different ways.”
Harris is also working on a podcast and YouTube series called “Conversations With A Black Girl” with her friends Amaria Stern and Tolu Ogunremi, both USC students, that will launch in November. The series was created to ensure a safe space for Black women and women of color.
Stern, a senior and fellow Kaufman student. who quickly became best friends with Harris after their freshman year, said their shared experience as Black women propelled them to create a platform where their voices could be heard. 
“The biggest issue I’ve seen is that Black girls do not feel supported in their endeavors,” Stern said. “I hope all Black girls feel supported with this project and however that Black womanhood is expressed.” 
Harris was inspired to start the series after creating her own nonprofit in high school. Bey Queens, which stands for Beautiful Empowered Young Queens, and plays on Beyoncé’s nickname, was aimed at empowering 13- to 17-year-old girls of color to love themselves. 
“[We wanted to] address topics that are going on at that age that are extremely pivotal but how young African American woman views herself and views her society that she’s around,” Harris said.
 Along with studying dance and working on her podcast, Harris is pursuing a minor in architecture and hopes to find a career that integrates the two fields. She said she feels fortunate to have been involved in dance throughout her life, but she understands that it is an extremely expensive passion to pursue, especially for people in her community. 
“I would love to somehow incorporate architecture with technology and recreate and design my own studio that is more efficient and a good space for dance,” Harris said.
Once she graduates, Harris hopes to design and build a dance studio that uses sustainable technology to make professional dance more affordable for people from underrepresented communities.
“Just anything like that to really have that power come from the dancers themselves rather than paying all this extraneous money to do it will make it accessible for more communities,” Harris said.

If you’ve ever been to the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, you’ve seen a glimpse of the contrast between classic and contemporary art: You have your Spanish Colonial art, highly religious and its meaning highly obvious, but you also get some 21st-century abstractions, highly confounding and their meaning highly obscured. The latter is the kind that casual observers like to bully around: “How is this art? My kid could’ve done that!”
Most of us like our art to be upfront; we don’t want to think about it all that much: “Oh look, it’s a field and some wheat. Beautiful. Got it. Moving on.” That’s why contemporary, abstract pieces are uncomfortable — because they slow us down. But, as we know from many a parody of snobby art critics, these paintings can conjure up myriad meanings if only we would take our time with them. 
It’s precisely because they’re so specific, unique and seemingly abstract that they can be applied to an eclectic set of interpretations. If you have a painting of a lady smirking at her painter, you’re confined to its frames; it’s likely you’re only thinking about what she may be thinking. Whereas, if you have a blue blob on a grey canvas, you can extrapolate many other meanings. It’s so specific, so detached from reality that it lends itself to different readings.  
Forgive me for taking the scenic route. My point, which is quite paradoxical, is this: The more specific the art, the more universal the interpretations.
I’m vindicated by Wayne Federman, professor of comedy at USC and recent Foundations of Comedy lecture guest. Federman told our class that he found his hit sitcom “Everybody Loves Raymond” — which showed very specific, personal characters, behaviors and situations — resonated with so many people. Thus, he concluded by encouraging the class to write personal, unique characters; though they are abstract on the page, we may find they are more universal than we think.
As our world gets increasingly complex, our filmmakers strive to send some sort of universal message to a wider audience, an expression of their frustrations with the world. Most of the time, this is preachy or just too ambitious (like “Jojo Rabbit” or “Joker”); but, the intention is there. 
In a world going slightly mad, an artist’s reflex is to emote and explain through their art. They can’t help it.
It’s already hard to make a movie; to make a good movie is even harder; to make a good movie that enlightens us with fresh, creative perspectives on the world … ever heard of Halley’s Comet? 
This is why I doubt “your kid could’ve made that.” Making art that can be read in multiple ways requires a highly creative, highly insightful mind (nothing against your kid, most of us are in the same boat). It’s generally rare, but these past years have actually seen a number of these insightful movies. Here’s the thing: Our world is so messed up that even this rare type of film has been steadily produced. There’s too much to work with. It’s a creative playground that’s already yielded some of the best films of this year.
South Korean director Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite” and Robert Eggers’ “The Lighthouse” are very specific, creative movies. In “Parasite,” a lower-class South Korean family cunningly seeps into a rich family’s life after being hired as houseworkers. In “The Lighthouse,” two men work a lighthouse for several months, slowly succumbing to some peculiar sort of madness. 
“Parasite” is one of my favorite movies of the year, and “The Lighthouse” may fall in the higher mid-tier. But, both are so specific in their premise, so unique in execution, that they merit appreciation if only because of the conversations they can start and the interpretations they can prompt. These movies are like parables: They tell a specific story that can be applied beyond the screen and generate truths about the real world. 
Remember the paradox. What’s more specific than the first scene of “Parasite,” where our protagonists are roaming about their semi-basement home, scraping their phones along the ceiling to piggyback on a free Wi-Fi signal? The answer: Willem Dafoe blubbering “go make the coffee” in late-19th-century sailor speak as a chunk of scrambled egg projects out of his mouth onto his burly beard. 
There’s a reason why critics fawn over movies like “The Lighthouse.” They give us so much to work with. In contrast to the ubiquitous superhero movies that don’t tell very specific stories — just generic ones of good versus evil — films like the latter two challenge us to think deeply and precisely because they seem so abstract and specific.  
Yes, Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson are very acutely drawn characters, but you can read different themes onto them, and that’s my favorite part about this movie and others like it. It’s not the cinematography, acting or even the specific dialogue — though I’m as big a fan of 19th-century Captain Ahab-esque talk as the next guy — it’s the story and how it compels our minds to discern what the film might be saying. 
“The Lighthouse” is about cabin fever, madness, divisions between young and old, father and son; it’s about brotherhood, marriage, love and lust, heaven and hell, flying too close to the sun, class divisions, guilt, greed, gluttony, wrath, mother nature, gods, superstition, truth, myth. 
“The Lighthouse” is not the best movie of the year, but at this point I don’t even want to talk about “best” and “worst” movies; I just want to talk about movies and what they have to say. 
And, any movie that allows my mind to play around in that grand list of themes is worth my money, my attention and my time, even if that’s just an extra second before moving on to the next superhero blockbuster.
