The USC College Republicans hosted a panel discussion Wednesday night focusing on President Barack Obama’s policies and actions regarding the U.S. economy, the recent health care reform bill and the state of the country’s foreign relationships.

The “Teach-In to Oppose Obama’s Radical Transformation of America” featured input from Sally Pipes, president and CEO of the Pacific Research Institute; David Bahnsen, an economics expert who heads a firm on Wall Street; and Victor Davis Hanson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and professor at Cal State Fresno.
The panel, sponsored by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, questioned the effectiveness of health care reform, citing a conflict between the cost of reform and benefits of changing the health insurance system.
“People make it clear they don’t want higher taxes, they don’t want higher deficits and they certainly don’t want rationed care,” Pipes said of health care reform.
Examining health care through the lens of economic policy, Bahnsen said Obama’s past stimulus and bailout efforts were proof of the president’s lack of success in crafting economic policy.
“The economic policies I lament in President Obama are not merely political difference, the differences are above all else a conflict in visions,” Bahnsen said. “May we stop this madness before we go past the tipping point.”
Hanson discussed Obama’s foreign policy relations with Russia, Iran, Israel and European world powers. He said he thinks Obama does not have a strong investment in protecting America’s interests on the worldwide level.
“There are going to be a lot of people who think they can make radical re-adjustments in the balance of power … because they think the United States is going to sympathize with them,” Hanson said.
The College Republicans held the panel to educate students about issues that have come up after the passage of the health care reform bill, said USC College Republicans President Alexa Ekman.
“This is about educating these people … There are so many things in the health care bill that us laymen would never have known,” Ekman said.
Kimberly Linares, a senior majoring in political science and theatre and a Democrat, said she appreciated the chance to listen to other opinions on Obama’s administration but disagreed with the panel’s characterization of the president.
“I don’t think they covered it completely fairly,” Linares said. “There were a lot of ideological biases, and then I think at the same time I felt they attacked Obama.”
Whether they agreed with the panel’s arguments or not, students who were in attendance said the panel was good opportunity to expand their knowledge on health care reform and other Obama policies.
“I would say some arguments were really good to me, I wouldn’t say I agree 100 percent with everything that was said,” said Michael Young, a sophomore majoring in political science and a Republican. “The three panelists are incredibly knowledgeable.”

Census Day is here and officials are continuing to work to make sure USC students understand the importance of being counted.
Thursday is Census Day — the day the government will use to take a snapshot of the country’s demographics. Residents across the country are asked to fill out the 10-question Census form based on where they are on April 1 and mail it back.
The Census Bureau has made an effort to ensure students know how to participate, but many students still say they are unclear about the census process or don’t feel the need to participate.
“I don’t really know what it entails — I haven’t really thought about it,” said Alex Beltran, a senior majoring in history.
The Constitution requires the national population to be counted every 10 years; the government uses these numbers to distribute federal funds for education, housing and health care programs. The census totals also determine the balance of power in Congress, since each state is allocated a number of seats based on its population.
The Census Bureau estimated that undercounting Californians in the 1990 Census cost the state more than $2 billion over the decade. Current trends indicate California might not gain any seats for the first time since it joined the union in 1850, and if the undercount is bad enough this year, it might even lose one.
“The census is extremely important for USC, as it helps to decide the allocation of federal financial aid, as well as funding for programs to improve the neighborhood surrounding USC,” said Marilyn Katzman, a junior majoring in international relations and psychology and an intern for the Census Bureau.
To enhance its awareness efforts at USC, the Census Bureau recently set up a table in Leavey Library to answer students’ questions.
Andrew Wright, a senior majoring in theatre and a Census Bureau employee, said about 20 students visit the table during the course of a day. He said the most common question students have is whether they should be counted at home or at school.
“It says so explicitly on the form they should be counted here,” Wright said.
This goes for international students as well, though many are unaware they need to participate in the census.
“The [international students] don’t count towards the congressional seats, but they do count towards how many people are using facilities,” Wright said.
Tony Tambascia, assistant dean for student affairs and executive director of the Office of International Services, said OIS has been working to create awareness about the census among USC’s international community through announcements on its website, Facebook page and weekly e-mail newsletter.
Still, some say they are not sure they will participate.
“If someone asked me, I’d probably do it, but no one’s asked me to fill out a survey,” said Natalia Dhirani, a senior majoring in fine arts who is originally from India.
Dhirani said she hasn’t seen any e-mails or ads and right now does not intend to participate.
Other students, however, said they will participate.
Mansour Alsaleh, a first-year graduate student from Saudi Arabia studying industrial and systems engineering, said he is used to filling out the census because he has done it in Saudi Arabia.
“I received their mail in my inbox,” he said. “I did this in my country. They count the number of people in the country to do a certain level of planning for the future.”
Dear Parent,
My name is Virginia Jimenez. I am a Partnership Specialist with the Census Bureau working on the Los Angeles West Central region which includes USC. As you correctly said, the Census form states NOT to include college students on the family’s form (unless they live with them and commute to college).The Census Bureau counts students where theyattend college or university through a variety of methods.
Students residing in group quarters, such as a dormitory, residence hall, sorority or fraternity house, receive census forms between April 1 and May 21, 2010. Each student should complete and return a form. Residence Life and Housing Staff work with Census Bureau employees to distribute and collect these forms. 
Students living off campos should have received their questionnaires already, like everyone else.
All students living at a particular off-campus address are considered part of one household, so only one form should be completed. It should include information about all the people living at that address. The form should be returned in the U.S.mail envelope provided.
For more information, please visit the census website at : http://www.2010census.gov/2010census
Thank You
I wonder how students living in fraternities and sororities are counted?  The official census form specifically states NOT to include a student on the family’s form.  Is USC/the Census Bureau reaching out to those students?  It is important, both short-term and long-term, to include everyone in the count.

The university has decided to reward its high-achieving students the best way it knows how — by letting them do more work in multiple fields of study.
The Academic Achievement Award, introduced Sunday by the Office of Undergraduate Programs, allows students who have at least a 3.75 grade point average and are pursuing a double major or minor to take up to 20 units for the price of 18 units. Without the award, every unit more than 18 costs $1,299 .
“The goal is to make it easier for students with excellent academic records to graduate with multiple programs of study and still graduate in four years,” said Gene Bickers, vice provost of undergraduate programs. “If they are capable of doing 20 units in a semester, then we’ll make it possible without an extra cost.”
In addition to holding a 3.75 GPA at the time they apply for the award, students also must have completed 32 units, including at least 12 units at USC, and must be able to demonstrate that taking additional units would contribute toward earning multiple degrees.
Students must also have declared a double major, a double degree or any form of a major-minor combination by the time they submit their applications. The diversity of the fields of study does not matter.
Unlike the Renaissance Scholarship, another award for students who study diverse fields that is awarded to 10 graduating seniors annually, the achievement award is not a competition. If all criteria are met, a student is guaranteed an award every semester an application is submitted.
Most merit-based awards, such as Trustee and Presidential Scholarships, are awarded before students commit to USC. The new award aims to recognize the efforts of transfers, spring admits and students who did not receive a scholarship. Bickers did note that transfer students are substantially less likely to pursue multiple studies than freshmen admits.
Bickers acknowledged the difficulty of determining how many students are interested in multiple programs of study, but he expects about 200 students to receive the award for the fall semester.
Ray Gonzales, senior director of research and reporting for the Office of Academic Records and Registrar, said 775 out of 16,000 undergraduates are enrolled in more than 18 units currently.
The university sent an e-mail Sunday to the more than 2,500 students with 3.7 GPAs and above, announcing the new award. Of those, only about 1,000 students have already declared multiple programs of study. Bickers said within 24 hours, his office received about 50 applications.
Applications will be processed beginning in mid-April. Bickers said students who apply before April 30 would be notified of an award decision before the end of finals.
Students have until Aug. 20, the Friday before fall classes begin, to apply for the award. More students could become eligible for the award after this semester’s grades are finalized, Bickers said. A student’s eligibility is based on his GPA when he applies — if a student’s GPA falls below 3.75 after they are granted the award, he will still receive the funding.
Bickers said students who believe they meet or will meet the requirements should register for 19 or 20 units before receiving an award notification. Students have until the third week of classes before they are billed for their units.
To accommodate the new program, USC’s schools have agreed to accept slightly less money per unit to redistribute tuition revenue to the achievement award. While 30 percent of tuition funds financial aid, 70 percent typically goes back to the schools, depending on the number of units taken within each school. The latter percentage will now marginally decrease.
Scott Macklin, a junior majoring in astronautical engineering, said he had been considering completing a minor but had trouble fitting it into his schedule without taking more than 18 units.
“I really would have liked the opportunity to minor in something unrelated to engineering, and this may have been enough encouragement to do that,” he said.
Lucas Biging, a junior majoring in geography, said although he does not qualify he would have pursued an extra degree if he could have done it in less than five years.
“If I could swing a big course load of 20 units and manage a 3.75, then I don’t see any reason why not to pursue this opportunity,” he said. “A little tuition break makes sense to me.”
Kelsey Ezer, a freshman majoring in business administration who will qualify for the award at semester’s end, said taking five or six classes seems tough, but she would consider it if needed.
“It’s a good idea if it can get you to graduate in four years if you couldn’t otherwise while taking a minor,” she said.
Bickers said the idea is not to push students to do too much but to help the students who can still excel while completing multiple objectives.

Chances are, if you use the word “Leo” in a sentence, you’re referring to Leonardo DiCaprio. This is neither unacceptable nor unjustified. Leonardo DiCaprio has become quite the accomplished actor, catapulting his career with blockbuster after blockbuster (Titanic, Blood Diamond, Catch Me If You Can, The Aviator and The Departed, just to name a few). But while “Leo” is indeed a contemporary starlet, I can’t help but feel our generation too often neglects his namesake, Leonardo DaVinci.
For example, how many USC students do you estimate saw DiCaprio’s latest triumph, Shutter Island? Now how many USC students do you estimate will go to see the DaVinci exhibit at the Getty? The fascinating collection of sketches and sculptures is on loan from Queen Elizabeth II, and is only appearing at the Getty for two months.
Drooling, I stared in awe at the sketches when I attended the free exhibit last Saturday. DaVinci was as eclectic as he was eccentric, and his genius is apparent even on his veritable scratch paper. It would be like if someone ripped the designated “doodle” page out of my notebook, then displayed it 500 years after my death. But I guarantee my one doodle page would not include sketches of war machines, horse musculature, profiles of nobles, gears, a furnace, cadaver sex (yes, you read that right) and drafts for landmarks. I’d be lucky if it included a childish sunset scene, a couple flowers and some song lyrics (written right-side up and left to right, not the cool DaVinci way).
I have an overdeveloped love for film, and DiCaprio is indeed one of my favorite actors, but I don’t want to see an appreciation for the rest of the arts die with the older generations. So this weekend, when the temperature at the beach suddenly drops below freezing (aka below 70°F), consider viewing the works of Leo, the elder. Whether you’re in it for the culture or the canoodling cadavers, you’ll be glad you did.

In an effort to increase efficiency and cater health care more toward students, USC has decided to switch its student health insurance plan from Anthem Blue Cross to Aetna Student Health insurance beginning in the fall.
In good health · Officials from the University Park Health Center re-evaluate student health insurance every five to six years. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan 
All students at USC are required to have health insurance, but those who can show proof they have other insurance do not have to get insured through the university.
Student health insurance at USC is offered through a third-party health insurance provider, and officials at the University Park Health Center re-examine the university’s health insurance plan every five or six years, according to Cathy DeFrancesco, senior clinical administrator for the UPHC.
“The reason we wanted to shop the market was because it was time and we listened to our students’ feedback about Anthem,” DeFrancesco said. “Some students complained that they didn’t feel that the customer service was student-oriented.”
Aetna, Anthem and three other health insurance companies pitched their plans last month to a student health advisory committee comprised of health administration officials, graduate and undergraduate representatives and USC officials.
In the end, DeFrancesco said, Aetna’s health insurance plan stood out as the best option for students.
“One of the reasons I think they did so well in the [bidding] process is that all the customers are students, and that’s a big change from Anthem,” DeFrancesco said.
While Anthem is a large health provider for both individuals and groups — such as universities — Aetna Student Health serves only students and is more familiar with the ins and outs of a college, DeFrancesco said.
With the switch to Aetna, however, the health insurance rate will jump from $985 to $1040 yearly. This rate increase, however, also comes with an increase in the yearly coverage limit, which will grow from $500,000 under Anthem to $750,000 with Aetna.
Also new with Aetna, referrals to doctors outside USC will be electronic and immediate so students will not be left hanging if their paper referral doesn’t come through, DeFrancesco said.
“Right now, sometimes students will show up at the specialist’s office and the carrier does not have record of the referral in place,” she said.
Working with Aetna’s advanced information technology, the UPHC also hopes to institute an online waiver system to help students speed up the process of opting out of USC student health insurance.
“Getting the waiver done was a bit of a pain,” said Jessica Hsueh, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “It took a while for my parents to mail me all the paperwork, and I was afraid I wasn’t going to get my insurance waived on time.”
In choosing the new plan, administrators also considered health insurance for graduate students, which has been complicated in the past, according to Jenny Farah, the graduate student representative on the student health insurance advisory committee.
“A lot of the concerns that I got from students that were graduate student-specific were the costs of adding dependents to their plan, and if many of them have children and they are reliant on the school’s plan,” Farah said.
Based on input from graduate students and the committee, the new plan will allow dependents to join Aetna Student Health for 60 percent less than what Anthem had charged, DeFrancesco said.
Robert Ward, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration, said any change in health care efficiency will help both graduates and undergraduates.
“Health care is obviously a big issue right now, and if USC can do anything to make it easier for students to get access to medical services, it’s a good thing,” Ward said.

A program that many community college transfers say was vital to their USC experience is now on the chopping block, another victim of the tough economy.
For four years, the SCholars Program at USC has helped bring community college transfers to the university and integrate them into USC life. But the program’s funding, which came from a $1 million grant from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, has run dry.
Organizers searched extensively for a solution but found only dead ends. Now, they have announced the end of the SCholars Program.
“We have tried just about every angle and unfortunately, because of the economy and other factors, we will not be able to continue as of August 2010,” said Judi Garbuio, associate dean of Academic Recognition and Scholars Programs..
The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation gave USC the grant in 2006 to establish the SCholars Program. It was designed to help first-generation and low-income students transfer to a four-year university by providing programs to introduce them to the curriculum, as well as to pay for the additional academic costs of attending USC.
USC began looking for another source of funding when it realized money was running out. The program needs between $200,000 and $250,000 per year to run, and the foundation could not renew the grant.
“Unfortunately, nobody has an extra $250,000 to give out,” Garbuio said.
For students currently in the SCholars Program, the end of the program means the end of their extra help and extra funding.
“These students go through financial aid for their tuition for USC, but SCholars helps them do exceptional things,” Garbuio said.
Garbuio said the SCholars Program held a number of events for its students, connecting them with faculty and aiding them with their academics.
“Our big cornerstone was the immersion week where they come to school two weeks before and go through a Writing 340 boot camp and do programs to acclimate them,” Garbuio said.
The SCholars Program also helped its participants by funding some of the extra expenses that might not have been covered by financial aid.
“They will not have some of the exceptional funding and programs,” Garbuio said. “Books, grants, attending conferences within their discipline, as well as paying for honors societies that they get accepted to but cannot afford will not be able to be provided through the program.”
Another important aspect of the SCholars Program is its work with local community colleges. The program reached out to a number of community colleges in the area to encourage students to consider attending four-year universities and to let students know what opportunities were available to them.
Garbuio said the end of the SCholars Program could affect the number of transfer applications USC receives from these community colleges.
“We will still have a large number of transfer applications, but we probably wont get as many of these types of students,” Garbuio said.
Since its establishment, the SCholars Program has provided opportunities to more than 60 students.
“Many of the students credit the program to helping them even come to USC,” said K.C. Mmeje, the SCholars Program director.
Mmeje said a number of the SCholars participants are disappointed the program is coming to a close.
“Obviously the students want the program to continue, but they understand what we were up against in terms of funding. It’s a tough situation for everyone involved,” Mmeje said.
Garbuio said current SCholars participants are working on ways to keep the program alive in spirit.
“When we had our meeting about the program ending, they said, ‘You know what, we will take care of ourselves, we are here,’” Garbuio said. “They want to start a student organization to provide the opportunities they had been given to come to USC to other students.”

Ben Malcolmson, the former Daily Trojan staffer and creator of the popular USCRipsIt website, is the most recent member of the Trojan family lured north by Pete Carroll.
Malcolmson is leaving the Trojans and his website behind to take a similar position with the Seattle Seahawks.  Malcolmson will remain with the team through the end of this week and will continue providing a scaled back version of the blog during that time.
Malcolmson tried out for the team in 2006 as part of a story for the Daily Trojan.  He made the team, and played in the Notre Dame game that season.  Before the start of the next season, Malcolmson, with Carroll’s approval, started the blog and website.  The website gave inside information about the Trojans to all who wanted it.
It was named CNBC’s No. 1 all-access blog in sports in fall 2009 by blogger Darren Rovell. The USC Sports Information department is already hard at work trying to find a replacement, with numerous candidates being considered, according to Malcolmson.  The website and blog are expected to continue in some form in the future.

With the final two home games of the year upon the USC men’s volleyball team this weekend, the Trojans find themselves in a spot that was unimaginable at the beginning of the season — seventh place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
“We definitely didn’t think we would be here,” said junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy. “But we still got a pretty good opportunity ahead of us with six games left.”
Recovering · Junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy hopes to lead the No. 6 Trojans to victory in home matches against UC Irvine and UCLA. - Gage Allard | Daily Trojan 
But the Trojans (11-9, 8-8) are still ranked sixth in the nation and will play two of those six games during their last homestand this weekend.
USC plays No. 11 UC Irvine (11-12, 6-10) in a rematch of the 2009 national championship game tonight and hosts No. 7 UCLA (14-9, 9-7) Saturday night in the home finale.
The Trojans defeated UC Irvine 3-2 in their last meeting in January, but both programs are not the championship squads they were in a year ago.
USC started the season 6-1 and No. 1 in the nation, but since then it has gone just 5-8 and slid down the national and conference rankings. Irvine also has been unable to put together a consistent run all year as well.
“We were both the belle of the ball last year, and now we’re in rental tuxes,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said jokingly.
Even though the Trojans made the 2009 championship match, they were in relatively the same position at this time last year. But the feeling around the team is a little different now.
“This time last year we sort of felt like we had nothing to lose. We had never been there before,” Troy said. “This year, we had higher expectations for ourselves, and we’re not fulfilling them.”
It’s been an up and down year for USC, with a lot more down than up recently. While the Trojans did defeat D-II Grand Canyon State last week, they are 1-3 in their last four games.
Ferguson has pointed to a shortened fall practice schedule because of injuries and national team commitments that hurt the team, but with the playoffs three weeks away, he has used the last two weeks of nearly uninterrupted practice to get his team to a new height.
“We’re at a whole different level than where we were three weeks ago,” Ferguson said. “Offensively, I think you’re going to see a whole different deal tomorrow night. We’ve been working on it big time, and these guys have improved a ton. I think it’ll be a little bit more exciting to watch us play volleyball.”
USC has tried to fix the problem by shuffling players around in the hope that one lineup will click. Last year, USC used just six different starting lineups, and five starters from the opening match of the season started the NCAA championship game.
This year, USC has already used seven different starting lineups, and four Trojans started in different positions for its match two games ago against BYU — than for its season opening match.
“As a coach, you walk the fine line of sticking with something and having continuity versus if something is not working and you need to make a change,” Ferguson said. “You never want to make a change for the sake of making a change, but you always want to better your situation. We feel like we’re getting close to where we want to be, and we’ll keep trying whatever we need to until we get something that works.”
First of all these are matches not games. Second the team lost only one starter in Libero, Luke Morris from last year’s championship final against Irvine with others gaining valuable experience from the unexpected great run at the end of the season. The coaching staff has to share some of the failures not preparing the team mentally once things started to go bad. Hopefully they can blast  the bruins on senior night at least!

In college baseball’s heavyweight division, every series is a grueling battle. This weekend’s Pac-10 prizefight is no different.
USC begins its home conference schedule at 7 p.m. when the Trojans welcome No. 21 Oregon State to Dedeaux Field to start a three-game series.
The Beavers (16-5) open up conference play after losing back-to-back games for the first time this season. They dropped a doubleheader against Long Beach State in Corvallis, Ore., falling by a combined score of 15-5.
But that has not been indicative of their play this year.
The Beavers opened with three wins in four games at Hawai’i and followed that series by taking two of three from Tennessee.
And before the last two games against the 49ers, they rattled off 10 wins in a row — allowing more than four runs just twice in that stretch.
USC (13-12, 1-2) has been looking for that kind of consistency all season long.
The Trojans continue to ride a wave of up-and-down play. They defeated Loyola Marymount 9-7 on Tuesday, but that came after they dropped two of three against Stanford last weekend.
They outslugged the Cardinal in the first game, 13-8, but lost the next two. The Trojans were right in the mix in both games but fell victim to Stanford’s timely hitting in the late innings.
The Cardinal won the middle game with a walk-off hit in the ninth inning and took the series finale with a tiebreaking single in the seventh.
Finding that consistency will be difficult against the Beavers.
They field one of the best pitching staffs in the conference, led by a couple of solid starters.
Oregon State’s Greg Peavey is 2-0 with a 2.32 ERA and opponents are hitting just .198 against him. Tanner Robles is off to a similar start with a 4-2 record and a 2.41 ERA.
At the plate, Oregon State has the lowest team batting average in the conference, but a few stars have paced the Beavers’ offense.
Stefen Romero is batting .352 with six home runs and 20 RBIs, both team-leading totals. He also sports a .461 on-base percentage and is perfect on the base paths with three steals in as many attempts. 
Carter Bell and Parker Berberet have also chipped in at the plate, each batting over .300 with eight and 17 RBI, respectively.
USC has dominated the series with the Beavers over the years, as well as recently. The Trojans have won five of the last six games against Oregon State, including a series sweep when the two teams met at Dedeaux Field in 2008.
But the Beavers have been a mainstay on the college baseball radar since winning back-to-back national titles in 2006 and 2007. Sweeping them again will be a difficult task.
USC will throw senior Kevin Couture in tonight’s opener against Peavey. Couture last pitched Friday against Stanford and lasted just four innings, allowing seven runs.
Sophomore Ben Mount will face Robles in Friday’s game, at 7 p.m. Mount continues to pitch well for USC, amassing a 2-1 record and a 3.54 ERA. He went seven innings Saturday against Stanford but picked up a no-decision in USC’s loss.
Fellow sophomore Andrew Triggs will start for the Trojans in Saturday’s series finale at 1 p.m., but the Beavers have yet to announce a starter. Triggs lasted into the seventh inning against the Cardinal but also recorded a no decision.

The No. 1 USC women’s water polo team will take a break from its grueling Mountain Pacific Sports Federation slate as it hosts No. 20 Brown at McDonald’s Swim Stadium tonight, in what could prove to be a challenging nonconference contest.
Scorer · Freshman two-meter Patricia Jancso is second on the team in goals so far this season with 22. She has put up an average of nearly two goals in her last six matches, including a hat trick in a win over No. 1 Stanford. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
That is because the Bears (15-6, 0-0) have won five out of their last seven games, including a strong showing in last weekend’s Road Runner Invitational, where they were just a few goals shy of upending UC Davis to take home the tournament title. As a result, the Bears have the full attention of the Women of Troy (14-1, 4-0) despite the fact the game is nonconference.
Brown is coming off dominating victories over Pomona-Pitzer College and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in which Bears senior Sarah Glick scored a combined seven goals and had seven combined assists.
“We’re still preparing for the game like it’s a big conference game,” said senior goalie Tumua Anae.” As a team, we make the decision to take every game seriously, especially for the seniors in our last year — it’s an opportunity to play a game.”
Instead of worrying too much about Brown, the Women of Troy will rely on their strengths as they aim to extend their winning streak to a season-high 13 games.
“For the most part, we just need to go over the game plan that we’ve had from the beginning,” said senior two-meter Kami Craig, who has netted 18 goals this season. “We just need to stick to our game, stick to our defense and take it one possession by one possession.”
One of the recent trends that has enabled USC to not only keep its winning streak alive but also defeat its opponents rather handily is its strong play in the first half. This was seen in the team’s last two matchups against Long Beach State and San Diego State.
Against the 49ers, the Women of Troy scored seven first quarter goals, while simultaneously keeping the 49ers off the scoreboard until the 1:26 mark in the second period. Two days later against the Aztecs, the unit scored six first-half goals in comparison to just one from San Diego State.
And as usual, the team was quick to credit its defense despite strong offensive displays.
“I think our focus on defense has enabled us to play well early,” Anae said. “If you do well on defense, it helps fuel your offense. You have more pride not to give up goals.”
Provided that type of mantra can carry over to tonight’s matchup with Brown, the Women of Troy might notch yet another victory.

For the USC track and field team, everything is bigger in Texas.
That’s because the Trojans will face what USC head coach Ron Allice calls “the best competition in the country” at the Texas Relays in Austin, Texas, from April 1 through April 3. The meet comes a week after the team rested most of its best athletes in lieu of the Stanford Invitational.
Over and out · Women of Troy senior hurdler Shalina Clarke currently holds the fastest 100-meter hurdle time in the nation at 13.41 seconds. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“This will be our biggest test of the season,” Allice said. “It will be a very intense, very competitive meet.”
When asked what kind of performance he expected from his team considering the quality of the competition, Allice simply said, “We’ll see.”
Allice has reason to be cautious with his prognosticating. The Texas Relays feature some of the top track programs in the country, including Florida State, Oklahoma, Baylor and the host Longhorns.
“We’ve got our work cut out for us,” Allice said. “These are some of the best athletes in the nation.”
He noted that he is not sure the athletes that will compete for USC this week will be the ones he will choose to race at some of the later, more crucial meets of the season.
“Our sprint relays are kind of a makeshift deal right now because we don’t necessarily have the four people that will be on [the final team] yet,” Allice said. “For example, we’ll put out a good 4×400-meter team at the relays that won’t necessarily be the best team we put on the track later on.”
He said the health and energy of his athletes is what spurred him to hold back his best combinations until later in the season.
“You just have to make decisions as you go through the season to keep people from getting injured,” Allice said. “But you still want to stay in a competitive mode, especially in Texas, because we’ll have all we can handle. If we survive Texas with some of the combinations we have, that will be a very good thing. But we could have some setbacks too, so we’ll see.”
Allice said he would hold some of USC’s more “dinged up” competitors out of the Texas Relays to keep them fresh and instead send them to the Cal State San Marcos Mangrum Invitational in San Diego. Among those staying in California are senior men’s triple jumper Aven Wright and sophomore men’s hurdler and sprinter Duane Walker.
“We can’t take chances,” Allice said. “The UCLA Dual Meet is the first day of May, and we want to be prepared.” 
USC should still have a very strong showing in some of the individual events in Texas. Freshman standout Reggie Wyatt will run in the men’s 400-meter hurdles.
Junior Brendan Ames will compete in the men’s 110-meter hurdles.
For the USC women, senior Shalina Clarke will run in the women’s 100-meter hurdles, an event in which she currently holds the fastest time in the nation at 13.41 seconds.
Whatever the results, USC should have a much better idea of where it stands in the nation’s hierarchy of the best track programs in the country at the end of the weekend.
“Everything before this has led up to this,” Allice said. “It will be interesting to see where we stand when it’s over.”
This is the kind of meet needed at Loker Stadium to get interest back for track & field especially when you have only one home meet all season.

Taking place in a parallel universe in which zeppelins land on the Empire State Building and Motorola Razr prototypes were invented by the military in the 1960s, Fringe explores exciting stories and scientific theories that are quite literally out of this world.

This science-fiction series, co-created by J.J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, will premiere its third season tonight with an episode titled “Peter” at 9 p.m. on Fox.
Lost creator Abrams decided to make Fringe less complicated and more accessible to viewers who haven’t necessarily seen every episode. Although the series picks up roughly where the last season left off, several episodes explore mini plots that allow viewers to tune in whenever they can. The show itself explores fringe science, a field of study different from mainstream science with theories that many scientists typically consider questionable and highly disputed.
Adding to the recurring theme of fringe science in the series, the show repeatedly depicts a parallel universe discovered by mad scientist Dr. Walter Bishop, played by John Noble. In this universe, the same characters exist, but the environment itself is a distortion of reality — the World Trade Center was not destroyed, for instance — and society is more technologically advanced.
Season two ended shockingly with FBI special agent Olivia (Anna Torv) discovering that Peter, Walter’s son, is actually from the parallel universe that appears throughout the show. Walter ends the season finale by asking Olivia not to tell Peter, revealing that his son has no recollection of ever living in the other universe.
Peter died from a rare flu at an early age when his father was unable to discover a suitable cure to save him in time. The show suggests that Walter, counting on the fact that there was a “duplicate” Peter in the other universe, kidnaps his son from the other realm to replace him at home. As the first two seasons past, viewers were appalled by Walter’s behavior, claiming that his actions were selfish, and keeping the truth about Peter’s origins from him was wrong.
Though some moments in season three’s premiere episode are quite radical, the episode provides viewers a better understanding of Peter’s past and why his father kept the truth a secret. Several unanswered questions are touched upon in this gripping episode and Noble gives an amazingly emotional yet convincing performance, showing a side of Walter’s character never seen before.
Although the explanations provided in this episode might not put all accusations pointed at Walter to rest, viewers will sympathize and appreciate the emotional side of this science-fiction thriller.
That said, the episode also offers several radical explanations for events and scientific theories that just seem a little too convenient. The writers should focus more on developing the theories explored in the show and slowly arriving at scientific solutions to keep the show from being any more implausible than it absolutely has to be.
In addition to answering many of the most perplexing questions from season two, tonight’s premiere also gives a first glimpse at a flashback from the 1960s, when Walter was younger and Peter was just seven years old. Though the plot itself is dubious at times, viewers will find the differences between the 1960s and present day intriguing and slightly humorous.
For those who do not watch the show already, Fox has put together a crash course on its website titled “Fringe 101.” The web brief allows new viewers to become familiar with the show’s main storyline. In addition to some basics, the website also provides viewers with four essential episodes to view before the premiere.
Without giving too much away before tonight’s much-awaited premiere, the episode definitely provides a gripping tale and a great balance between the science-fiction thriller and meaningful storyline. But with only some questions answered and many more reaching the surface, the season will continue to depict the battles between the two realities, making for an out-of-this-world experience for its viewers.

Even with all of the fans lining the barrier of Cromwell Field on Wednesday, USC’s annual pro day was a somewhat subdued spectacle.
Maybe it was Texas’ concurrent pro day drawing away scouts. Maybe it was the fact that Pete Carroll didn’t make a return to Los Angeles — instead he was in Austin, Texas, scouting Longhorns. Or maybe it was the lack of a player like Mark Sanchez to draw everyone in.
In any case, Wednesday’s audition for the NFL draft lacked the hyperbole that normally accompanies such events. Former Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford and former Oklahoma State wide receiver Dez Bryant received more attention for their individual workouts than more than dozen Trojans.
But even in such a quiet setting, there were still plenty of small opportunities for many USC players to sway NFL teams.
For safety Taylor Mays, it seemed odd that he was even on campus. Touted as one of the best physical specimens in college football since his freshman year, Mays seemed like a lock to leave after his junior season. But Mays has found that even the most physically gifted prospects are closely scrutinized.
“It’s like I’m a newborn baby,” Mays said. “It’s what everybody has to do; it’s part of the process. That’s what makes it special, having to prove yourself again.”
After running a disputed yet undoubtedly fast 40-yard dash time at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis, Mays elected not to run the drill at USC. But the safety still had something to prove to scouts in attendance and participated in defensive back drills.
“These drills were most important to me because they show what I don’t show on film,” Mays said. “They know I can run fast and hit, but being able to be a big safety and move is the biggest question mark.”
Part of Mays’ preparation for the NFL has been a rewiring of his playing style. After meeting with several NFL teams, Mays realized that the role he played at USC will be different from the one on his future team.
“I was taught to go for the receiver. In the NFL, you get paid to make interceptions,” Mays said. “I wasn’t really coached to do it at USC, but I know I can do it in the NFL.”
Fellow safety Will Harris might have had the most impressive day of anyone in attendance. After making the most of his sole year as a full-time starter, Harris ran a 4.59 40-yard dash and posted an incredible 35 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press.
Harris doesn’t generate the same kind of recognition that Mays or USC’s other elite prospects do, so making the most of this opportunity could prove critical in catching a team’s attention.
“There are a couple of things I could have done better, but I did well on a lot of things, so at the end of the day I’m happy,” Harris said.
Joe McKnight used the day as a means of distancing himself from his USC career. The running back repeatedly stated that he felt his three years in Los Angeles did not live up to expectations. After a somewhat tumultuous ending to his time at the school, McKnight is looking forward to starting a new chapter.
“I could have done more these past three years,” he said. “But things happen for a reason.”
Comparisons to Reggie Bush followed McKnight around USC since his arrival as a freshman from Louisiana. As he moves on to the professional level, McKnight just wants the chance to be himself.
“I tried to do too much of the stuff [Bush] did instead of playing my ball,” McKnight said of his playing career at USC.
For running back Stafon Johnson, the day was an opportunity to restate his perseverance — not that anyone needed confirmation of that. Johnson has remained resolute in returning to football since a grisly weightlifting accident forced him to undergo emergency surgery on his vocal cords.
Johnson proved that he belonged by returning to the field and working out at the level of any other prospect expecting to get drafted. Wearing a shirt that said “God has a plan” on the back, Johnson displayed confidence in his performance and NFL future.
“Mentally, I’m stronger than ever,” Johnson said. “Right now, just going through the process had made me mature and more determined to get the job done.”
If there was one thing that was universal for all of the players Wednesday, it was the sense that the process was wearing on them. With three weeks until draft day, there’s only so much the players can do before the process comes to an end.
Maybe then it will be easier to find meaning in this pro day.

On a sunny afternoon in Los Angeles, nearly a hundred NFL coaches and scouts descended upon Cromwell Field for USC’s annual pro day to evaluate the Trojans’ top prospects in preparation for this month’s NFL draft.
Quick · Safety Taylor Mays, who played four seasons as a Trojan, didn’t run the 40-yard dash at Wednesday’s pro day, but he did run both the short and long shuttles and competed in individual defensive back drills. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
With the draft looming on the horizon, many former Trojans were looking to use Wednesday’s workouts as an opportunity to move up the draft boards. At this point in time, however, it’s unclear whether any of them significantly improved their draft stock.
Safety Taylor Mays, along with tight end Anthony McCoy, running back Joe McKnight and wide receiver Damian Williams, opted out of the 40-yard dash, the most weighted drill of the program.
Nonetheless, Mays, who ran a 4.43 last month at the NFL scouting combine, still had a solid performance in some of the position drills conducted by NFL coaches and later noted the importance.
While McCoy and Williams’ workouts were rather nondescript, McKnight’s afternoon was noteworthy simply because he failed to meet expectations once again. The Louisiana native struggled in both the short- and long-shuttle runs, tripping up twice in the latter. In an interview with the NFL Network, McKnight claimed that he had re-aggravated a toe injury before the workout.
“Everything happens for a reason,” McKnight said. “Hopefully something good will come out of this.”
But while the day did not seem to radically improve the draft stock of some players, it might pay big dividends for others.
Defensive end Everson Griffen, whose 40-yard dash time at the combine last month was second best among defensive lineman at 4.66 seconds, saw a significant improvement when he recorded a personal best of 4.59 seconds.
“I just showed them that I’m ready to go,” Griffen said. “I can contribute. I’m ready to work at any given time. I’m just wishing for the best right now.”
While scouts in attendance noted that the 6-foot-3 defensive lineman might have launched himself into the first round, his draft slot doesn’t seem to be his biggest concern.
“Wherever I end up, I’m ready to play,” Griffen said. “First round, second round, it doesn’t really matter to me. I just want to play football. Put me on a team, and I’m going to contribute.”
In addition to Griffen’s strong effort, there were others who also raised eyebrows.
Cornerback Kevin Thomas ran a 4.43 in the 40-yard dash, which was the fastest for any Trojan, and offensive lineman Alex Parsons posted a 4.90, one of the best times that any lineman has posted this spring.
Safety Will Harris had one of the more surprising  performers with 35 bench press reps of 225 pounds — second best on the team and even besting offensive lineman Jeff Byers and defensive tackle Averell Spicer.
“I made sure I went out and dedicated my life to this training,” said Harris, who finished with six interceptions last season. “I know I had to come out here and put on a show for these guys, and that’s exactly what happened.”
All in all, Wednesday’s pro day provided an opportunity for many Trojans to eventually earn an NFL spot and an opportunity to build upon their time spent with Pete Carroll’s USC program.
In particular, individuals such as Griffen and McKnight are looking to use the NFL draft process as an opportunity to experience better professional careers after underachieving during their collegiate years.
“We didn’t win a national championship or score a lot,” McKnight noted. “I just felt my career didn’t go as I wanted it to. But I got a chance to make up for it, and I’m going to try my best.”
Perhaps no one values the opportunity for a second chance more than Stafon Johnson. After suffering a life-threatening neck injury last September, Johnson got back on the football field for the first time in the Senior Bowl last January and is now looking to prove that he is more than deserving of a spot in this month’s draft.
“Today was a day where I had to show that I was back to normal,” said Johnson, who posted a 4.62 40-yard dash time. “I’m at full speed. Each month, I’ve been getting stronger and faster. I’m the same running back that I was before.”
If Johnson’s past few months are any indication, every experience like this one is an opportunity for players to work toward a better future.

Don McKay is writer/director Jake Goldberger’s feature film debut. The independent film premiered almost a year ago at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival and is finally getting a wider release in Los Angeles, New York and Boston this week. Starring Thomas Haden Church (Sideways), Elizabeth Shue (Leaving Lost Vegas) and Melissa Leo (Frozen Rivers), the film is an odd, eerie and humorous tale of secrets, lies and murder.
Bloody mess · Thomas Haden Church plays janitor Don McKay. - Photo courtesy of Image Entertainment 
Don McKay (Church) is a down-and-out janitor who receives a mysterious letter from his high school girlfriend, Sonny (Shue), informing him that she is dying and wants him to come see her. Don rushes to her side but finds that she has changed dramatically from the last time he saw her, when he left his hometown 25 years ago. Unsure of how to act when everyone he encounters evaluates him with suspicious eyes, Don slowly begins to unravel the truth behind Sonny’s plea for him to return and, as a result, has to come to terms with the current condition of his own life.
Goldberger’s admiration for the twisted humor and outrageous storytelling techniques of the Coen brothers is clearly evident, but he has difficultly blending multiple genres. McKay starts off with an overly kitschy feel, and many of its scenes are laugh-out-loud funny, especially those between Don and Samuel (M. Emmet Walsh), the hard-of-hearing cabdriver who Don befriends.
It’s often unclear, however, whether the audience is meant to laugh. The humor is not pushed far enough to counter the film’s underlying creepiness.
Steve Bramson’s delicate, moody score is present throughout the opening sequences, which is often misleading when the film is supposedly not taking itself seriously. Similarly, the scenes in the film that are supposed to be the most disturbing feel limp, without any real sense of danger or fear.
The cinematography in Don McKay, as executed by Phil Parmet, employs the film noir technique of combining stark darks and lights to create constant tension. Nonetheless, the overall look of the film is uninspiring, and the fact that it is a low-budget indie could not be more obvious.
The film’s major weakness is its lack of a strong protagonist. Considering he lends his name to the film’s title, we expect Don to possess a particularly compelling personality. Instead, he functions primarily as a prop, moving as robotically as a game token in a board game. Granted, as a lumbering, lonely man with nothing to live for, we cannot expect him to portray much chutzpah, but his glazed, emotionless expression quickly loses its ironic appeal.
Church does an excellent job of squinting and looking confused for the majority of the film, but he inevitably becomes the least interesting element of the story. The strong comedic thrust Church has displayed in past films is not present here, and, as a result, the actor loses most of his charm.
The story is really propelled by the disturbing antics of Sonny, who is simultaneously intolerable and infectious. Her character is bipolar, alternating between shrill and overly sweet. Shue masters Sonny’s two-faced nature so well that we long for more screen time with her, just to see what she’ll do next. Unfortunately, Sonny’s frantic displays of attachment to Don also make us question why in the world Don decides to stay by her side. He does provide an explanation near the end of the film, but his reasoning is so ludicrous you’ll want to clock him on the head.
The character of Marie (Leo), meanwhile, is a villain pulled right out of Hitchcockian lore — indeed, she could pass as the identical twin of Mrs. Danvers, the sinister housekeeper in Rebecca.
Marie gives Don the obligatory melodramatic evil eye at the end of each of her scenes and lurks conspicuously in the background of important conversations between Don and Sonny. Leo’s performance is spot-on, straddling the right level of ridiculous and eerie to make her scenes simultaneously funny and deeply disturbing.
By the film’s conclusion, we have taken a long look at a man who is so haunted by his past that he has built walls of illusion around himself. The question that lingers is how Don will reshape his life to make sense of the madness he’s encountered and finally figure out what it is that he wants.
Goldberger’s script is an excellent character examination, but his attempt to combine drama with a tense horror film is ultimately a bit clumsy. In addition, the script suffers from some undeveloped characters (such as Don’s childhood friend Otis) and a couple unresolved plot points, which ultimately leave the viewer feeling unsatisfied.
Don McKay is an admirable first filmmaking attempt, but Goldberger still has a long way to go before he masters his skills at directing.

Everyone has heard the warning: Don’t put images or statements online that you wouldn’t want potential employers to see.
Now more than ever, companies are checking the public online profiles of prospective new hires. So if you upload that incriminating photo from your friend’s 21st birthday party or Tweet a nasty comment about a former boss, you could be saying, “So long, new job.”
This warning has been drilled into our heads by parents, teachers and career seminars, but is it just a fear tactic designed to make youth cut back on their Internet-advertised debauchery — or does the argument actually hold true?
As it turns out, it does. A recent survey from Microsoft said that 70 percent of U.S. hiring managers have rejected an applicant based on something the applicant posted online, and that number is only going to go up as more companies turn to the Internet to scope out potential employees.
Understandably, this might make you a bit paranoid about what you do online. What specifically are they doing to check on applicants?
Companies have embraced the online world, and are quite savvy at foraging through your public resources. They search for information on applicants via e-mail addresses, not names, so simply changing your screen name on Facebook or Twitter — a recent trend — is not going to help.
There have been many cases of people ranting about their jobs online, only for their bosses to see it and fire them. The Internet is a pulpit for opinion, but we have to remember that it is also public.
If the Internet can be so costly to our future in the job market, then should we continue to use it? I highly doubt people would abandon Facebook in order to remain scandal-free for jobs, but if using it is detrimental to our future, it might not be worth it.
But not every online presence is negative. The truth is the Internet can actually help with your career in the long run — the trick is to use it to your advantage. While the research from Microsoft mostly reflects how an honest Internet comment can be detrimental to hiring, it also showed that good content online can help you get that job you want. A strong, positive Internet presence demonstrates technological savvy and networking skills that many employers look for these days.
In fact, if you have a strong Internet presence that shows off a wide range of skills, then it can negate some of the unsuitable content. If you run a website or blog that demonstrates an expertise in an area that you are looking for a job in, then the site could help show that you have the skills for the position.
A friend of mine is a great example of this. He has a well-viewed video online where he shotguns a can of beer. At the same time though, he runs three websites that are not only very serious but show off his skill at research, technology and web television.
So if an employer were to search for him online, they would find a large range of information on him, and more than likely the good content would outweigh the content seen as inappropriate.
This isn’t to say that as long as you have good content online that you can post anything on the Internet and not worry about how it can affect your career. Keep some common sense in mind with what you post online. If you think something would make you look bad, don’t post it. Watch your language, especially if you are talking about work, and just be aware that employers are checking.
There are ways to help make your online presence more favorable for employment. It helps to sometimes set up multiple e-mail accounts — one professional, the other personal. This allows you to put the professional e-mail on your résumé, keeping some more personal aspects of your life away from employers, and even helps to organize your e-mails as a whole.
In addition to promoting yourself online, you can use the Internet to help find jobs. Sites like LinkedIn.com allow for professional networking between companies and potential employees. Users can set up a strong list of contacts, references and even recommend others for positions through the site. They can also post their résumés for employers to look at.
Then there are websites for job listings. Instead of having to call and track down employers, applications and search filters for jobs are clicks away.
Taking advantage of these resources can help you not only find a job but get an application in quicker. The internet should be a tool to help you further your career, not stop it in its tracks. So don’t let some photos or comments keep you from landing that dream job. We are supposed to be the tech-savvy, networking generation. Let’s use that to our advantage.

Every year during spring, we encounter urge to succumb to the temptation of the siren’s call. For years, scientists and poets have mislabeled the phenomenon of her allure as “spring fever.” But it is no fever, nor is it passed from human to human.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
Springtime is a seductive mistress, constantly pulling us to a warm grassy spot to count the number of white cloud that float by.
Maybe the only contagious part of spring is seeing others fall under spring’s spell. When they succumb, it can lessen our own resistance as we feel that same tug toward lackadaisical irresponsibility.
The six weeks post-spring break and pre-summer might well be the most challenging time of the academic year for college students, not necessarily because of the workload or course requirements — though this period does coincide with the much-celebrated midterm season — or because we’re forced to sit and study for long, tedious hours.
It is because the spring extends its wanton invitation to throw our responsibilities out the window and go frolicking down to Red Mango. But we must not give in. Or if we do, only in small bites.
The process of recovering from spring break is compounded by an all-consuming focus on the hope and promise of summer, which can often be enough to thoroughly derail a student’s motivation from anything academic.
Jesse Mentz, a sophomore majoring in international relations, articulates this quandary: “Spring break is like a glimpse of summer; as soon as you get it, you just want more,” he said. “And so at about the time you start getting used to the lifestyle of spring break or summer, you have to go back to classes. Then you’re just really excited for summer or spring break again, and you can’t really get back into the work mode.”
Spring’s mystical powers were especially strong last weekend; the warm weather and glorious sunlight only served to further excite us about the prospect of summer and what undiscovered sunny treasures it holds.
A quick walk around campus affirms that students have begun to partake in warm-weather activities. The campus has been filled with sunbathing or sport-playing students.
All jesting aside, there is biological substantiation for the apathetic mood that tends to grip the masses about this time of year. The New York Times states the biological process this way: “The increasing intensity and longevity of sunlight in spring is somehow measured by the brain, probably through the eyes. This information is then transmitted to the pineal gland in the base of the cerebrum, which responds by reducing its secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences mood and energy levels.”
Therefore, in the same way that a good-smelling meal encourages the secretion of saliva and excites us about the prospect of eating, the sun as an external stimulus encourages the secretion of hormones that make us feel alert.
The change of seasons gives students a distinct feeling of revival, as the return of sunlight breaks gloom of winter.
So are we to flee sunshine altogether and find refuge in dark places? Probably not, for I’m quite sure no one would entertain such a suggestion. Alternatively, should we lash out in rebellion against spring? Chances are its effects are already being felt so strongly that few could be bothered to take action requiring that much energy. So the best course of action is to give in to springtime temptations in well-measured moderation. While it might be idyllic to spend the day in sunny reverie, schoolwork also calls; we must encourage a balance between the two. Indulge with temperance and use outdoor activities as a reward for diligence and concentration.
Better yet, study outside with friends. Studies have shown that these habits tend to increase focus anyway.
Mental fortitude and careful preparation are necessary to combat the allure of spring, so be wary and ready yourself, giving into the call only in healthy intervals.
If you should fall prey, you can rest comfortably in knowing that the consequences of the reckless frolic are likely to burn a few extra calories and regain a bit of mental health that will make you more effective when you develop the resolve to refocus.

Every morning I go through the same routine: eat breakfast, watch Good Morning America, sit through negative commercials about California’s gubernatorial candidates and go to class.
Lately, I have become a victim of pre-election bickering at its worst. Republican candidates Meg Whitman and Steve Poizner have made it clear that they’re running against each other in California’s gubernatorial election, and they’re doing whatever it takes to bring each other down on the way to the finish line.
On the Democratic front, candidates Richard Aguirre and Attorney General Jerry Brown have taken the high road and refrained from as much mudslinging.
What’s lacking in these candidates’ campaigns are more positive, informational advertisements that will reach a large audience. Until voters get a sense of the candidates’ platforms from a passive medium, such as television, they will not actively search for more information on the Internet or in newspapers.
Whitman frequently features an advertisement on television called “Why we can’t trust Steve Poizner,” and as a rebuttal, Poizner has created a commercial to deflate Whitman’s platform by calling her a liberal candidate. Sticks and stones, guys.
But what really pushes my buttons about these commercials is that they don’t actually inform me about either candidate’s merits. Rather, they turn me off from wanting to vote for either of them.
Typically, my opinion wouldn’t stand out among those of the rest of the American people, and the gubernatorial candidates could do whatever the majority voter demographic wanted them to do. But recently, college students have proven to have some influence on election outcomes, such as in the 2008 presidential election in which the outpouring of student support helped to push Obama’s campaign over the top.
According to the Center for Information Research on Civic Learning Engagement, those in the 18 to 29 national age demographic made up 18 percent of voters in the last presidential election. What’s more, 66 percent of those voters supported Obama. It appears, then, that the candidates for governor would be well served by listening to student opinions and appealing to them through the emphasis on positive campaign goals, much like President Obama did with his campaign for “change.”
Several students said they do not approve of the publicly advertised candidate brawls.
“I don’t respect it … when candidates use negative campaigning because it sort of makes me feel that they don’t have enough good things to say about themselves if that’s what they’re depending on,” said Katherine Wittig, a sophomore majoring in mathematics.
Deb Berman | Daily Trojan
Those students also said campaign smearing could affect their decision in favor of a candidate who did not partake in the activity.
“I do think that it does negatively affect my opinion of their ideals because if you’re strong enough as a candidate on your own, then I believe you can use your own ideas and present that to the people and not have to rely on tearing down your opponent,” said Debbie Ngai, a senior majoring in chemical engineering.
Political mudslinging is not a new phenomenon; it allows candidates to differentiate themselves from competitors in a race in order to garner as much support as possible.
“I’ll say everything bad about what another pitcher can do because I’m a pitcher. But that pitcher might be an outstanding athlete,” said Jake Hamblin, an undecided freshman. “So [the candidates are] really just attacking each other’s weaknesses, and that makes sense because they’re in competition with each other trying to win a job.”
It could even have bigger strategic implications for the parties in question.
“Since both sides of the campaign are enacting negative tactics, I think this not only makes the race more interesting but keeps the candidates on their toes, and by doing so keeps the attention on the Republican candidates,” said Alexa Ekman, president of USC College Republicans.
But while this  process of back and forth is commonplace in all political elections, it seems to be much more prevalent in this current gubernatorial election.  More than the candidates’ ability to tattletale, students are concerned with their platforms and self-described qualifications, which are incredibly important considering this will be the first gubernatorial election that many current undergraduate students will have the opportunity to participate in.
The three main issues affecting students are education, the environment and job creation, said Bobby Almeida, president of the USC College Democrats. However, these are not the issues candidates have been discussing in their advertisements thus far in the campaign.
“I’m looking for someone who can turn California around and bring us back to good economic times and good educational times.
And although I’m not the biggest tree hugger on campus, I worry that global warming will greatly affect my life as well as my family members’ lives in the future.
In addition, I’m concerned about the amount of jobs that will be available to me after my college graduation. And what about my family members who plan to attend a California state university soon? Will they pay too much money for a subpar education because of budget cuts?
In order to feel confident about voting for a specific candidate, I need one of them to address and fight for the issues that impact my family and me. Is that selfish? Yes. But now that I have potentially 18 percent of the total vote to back me up on my concerns, I should no longer seem so insignificant.
To all the candidates running in the gubernatorial election: You’re better off shifting the focus from thinking of snarky negative comments about other candidates to getting the word out about what makes you superior. If I don’t know about your commendable qualities and efforts to address my concerns, I might have to rely on the false accusations your opposing candidate has assured me makes you unqualified to be the next governor of California. And if that’s what students have to rely on, even the nastiest of mudslingers might not get very far in the race.

1. Jerry Brown hasn’t gone negative because Richard Aguirre is far from a worthy opponent. Brown is a shoe-in -Aguirre has zero name ID. Brown doesn’t have to differentiate himself from a candidate whom no one knows. Aguirre hasn’t tried to take down Brown because he doesn’t have the money to do so.
2. Whitman and Poizner have a relatively competitive primary until June, which is indicative of their decisions to go negative. Nearly all competitive races around the country, on both sides of the aisle, go negative to supplement their message.
3. Whitman and Poizner aren’t entirely negative. They started their campaigns by doing their introductory ads and have gone on air to push their messages. Many candidates will run on the anti-establishment, anti-D.C. platforms which is testament to a lack of substance in issue stances. You’ll see plenty of “fix washington, cut taxes, control spending” type of ads aside from what you misconceived (and misreported for that matter) as only negative campaigns.
4. The age cohort you mentioned, of which 66% voted for President Obama, will likely not vote again because he isn’t on the ballot. President Obama was a fantastic candidate and drew voters to the polls that would have never pointed. Watch for a significant drop in 2010 voter turnout.
I don’t want to be the typical web commenter who accuses the media of being too liberal. However, your bias is clear and the seat is warm atop your high horse.
May I point out the obvious?
One: You are a journalist for a liberal newspaper and 95% likely to vote for the Democrat, so the Republican candidates don’t matter to you either way.
Two: I correct myself: you’re about 10% likely to vote for the Democrat, because college students ALMOST NEVER go to the polls except in Presidential election years. But if you DO go, you’ll vote for whatever Democrat you see on the ballot.
Three: The major issue (one) is the economic and fiscal disaster currently unfolding in Sacramento due to uncontrolled spending and indefinitely escalating taxes, which are pushing the state toward bankruptcy, due to the fact that we keep electing Democrats who are controlled by the public sector unions. The only solution to the problem is electing Republicans this year, probably a futile struggle in this hopeless state. But whether it succeeds or not, NO USC STUDENT IS GOING TO BE A PART OF IT because you’re all going to vote based on “global warming” or some such nonsense that Jon Stewart tells you is the important issue.

Last Wednesday, At the Movies was finally, tragically canceled. The movie review television show — originally made famous by Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert — will air for the last time this August.
Even current co-host A. O. Scott, one of the nation’s sharpest minds in film criticism, expressed a certain not-surprise at receiving the news. The show has been headed in this direction for some time and over the years, it’s been like watching the brick-by-brick collapse of a once-towering cultural pillar.
Scott knew, I knew — everyone knew this was coming. But even the inevitable can still sting.
A lot has been said about what this means. Some people are calling it the end of an era. I like pop-culture critic Ken Tucker’s remark best: “There will be a lot of wailing about At The Movies disappearing, but such protestations are like the ones that abounded when Conan O’Brien was ousted from The Tonight Show — i.e., it’s likely that few of the people who now regret the passing of At The Movies are actually watching it every week these days.”
Ken’s right. At the Movies has become a show most people know about — it’s the thumbs-up, thumbs-down show, right? (not anymore, actually) — but few actually watch. I’m one of the few.
Some of it is our fault as viewers (or non-viewers), some of it is Disney-ABC Domestic Television’s. Despite mistakes in the past, Disney redeemed itself by bringing in Scott and Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips as the new hosts. Their rigorous intellectual debate on the show harks back to Siskel and Ebert’s. And the web exclusives aren’t too shabby, either.
But it obviously wasn’t enough. It’s exasperating, but we can’t be mad. Our appetite for wholesome film criticism — the stuff Scott and Phillips put out each week — has been curbed by a steady diet of blog-post chaff. In the age of Twitter, who needs stuffy Ivy Leaguers spinning out esoteric appraisals of little-seen films from the comfort of their plushy armchairs?
It boils down to this: criticism is necessary because it keeps artists producing art. Once we stop thinking critically about something — once we stop talking about it — it stops trying to improve itself. The cancellation of At the Movies will not ruin movies, obviously, but it signifies a not-so-subtle shift in our priorities.
Do we need middle-aged men telling us which movies we should see, rent or skip? Sure, maybe, but that was never the point of At the Movies. It was to chat for 30 minutes each week about why certain films work and why others don’t. It’s a conversation we’ve been having for all time — and one we must not let be silenced.

Lane Kiffin announced Tuesday USC’s new policy for football practice access.
In order to gain admittance to practice, guests must request access from the USC athletic department as least 24 hours beforehand. Even so, this opportunity will not be available to anyone.
Those who can take advantage of the approval policy are parents, guardians, siblings and spouses of current players. Other guests, escorted by USC administrators, may also be admitted. Furthermore, USC student access will not be affected.
Those primarily banned from entering practice are agents, their employees or their representatives.
Guests admitted to practice may only have contact with coaches and athletic department employees.
Kiffin’s decision to implement these new policies is likely a response to a suggestion from the NCAA committee that conducted USC’s hearing for alleged recruiting violations last month. By denying entrance to agents, USC hopes to protect its players from infringing upon NCAA stipulations that bar a college player’s conducting business with an agent.
The previous practice policy which former coach Pete Carroll had in place was one of the most relaxed in college football. While many Trojans fans enjoyed being able to watch the football practices, it left the door open for agents to being fraternizing with players. Furthermore, it gave other teams the option to maximize scouting efforts against the Trojans and perhaps steal some of the team’s plays.
