Peace Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet, Congresswoman Karen Bass (D-Calif.), U.S. State Department Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Public Affairs Karen Richardson and returned Peace Corps volunteer Ravi Shah met Friday in the Sol Price School of Public Policy to discuss how serving in the Peace Corps facilitates international diplomacy.
The event was part of the “State of the Union: Cabinet in Your Community” tour, where Cabinet officials have had the opportunity to discuss issues of national importance following President Obama’s State of the Union address. The event also followed a Peace Corps announcement in October 2015 of a 40-year record high in application numbers. California ranked as the top Peace Corps volunteer state in 2015.
The event began with Richardson highlighting the rise of terrorism, which she said has led many Americans to question whether or not the United States should continue getting involved in foreign affairs.
Richardson responded to this notion by alluding to Secretary of State John Kerry’s address to the University of Virginia, where he stated that “there is nothing foreign about foreign affairs.” With this quote, she opened the discussion so other participants could give their opinion regarding the role of the Peace Corps in initiating international conversation.
Hessler-Radelet said the United States needs more global-minded citizens as the world is increasingly connected.
“Our security and economy is inextricably connected to that of other countries, and we need people that understand the world,” Hassler-Radelet said.
She also stressed how a global perspective is essential for business within the United States.
“In addition, our country is becoming increasingly multicultural. From recent research, I have uncovered, I have learned that organizations that solicit ideas from other cultures are stronger,” she said.
As a volunteer in Ukraine, Ravi Shah explained how the Peace Corps influenced his understanding of the world.
“Without [the] Peace Corps, without having gone to Crimea or Ukraine, we would have less of a perspective of what is going on there,” Shah said.
Hessler-Radelet explained the importance of a multicultural understanding by revealing an untold story of Peace Corps volunteers in West Africa during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. While they had to be removed from their communities due to safety precautions, many continued working closely with the Center for Disease Control. This was helpful because of their rich understanding of West African communities.
“[The CDC] often tells us they could not have done their work without our staff,” Hessler- Radelet said.
The discussion also focused on the intangible benefits of volunteering with the Peace Corps.
“You come away with a multicultural understanding, you mature, you grow,” Shah stated.
Sam Moore, a graduate student studying public policy, spoke about how his Peace Corps experience helped in his development.
“You learn about yourself. You become comfortable with yourself and you learn how strong you really are,” Moore stated.
Jared Thomas, a graduate student studying public administration, explained why he chose to attend the event.
“I wanted to learn about international diplomacy and the international conversation,” he said. “I understand that to be a leader, you need to understand the international conversation.”

After breaking into the Top 25 rankings for the first time since March 2014, the Women of Troy suffered their third loss of the season in a 73-61 defeat to Washington State.
With No. 25 USC (14-3, 2-3) missing starters Jordan Adams and Brianna Barrett, reigning Pac-12 Player of the Week Temi Fagbenle finished with 10 points and 15 rebounds while fellow forward Kristen Simon chipped in a team-high 19 points along with 8 rebounds. Freshman Aliyah Mazyck did an admirable job filling in for Barrett with 10 points and four assists; however, she also committed five turnovers and struggled down the stretch.
Washington State’s freshman sensation Borislava Hristova had 21 points and Louise Brown finished with 10 points and 13 rebounds in the win for the Cougars (12-5, 3-3).
After a close start to the game, Coach Cynthia Cooper was not happy with the team’s performance and called a timeout with six minutes left in the second quarter. The Women of Troy immediately responded with an 11-0 run that extended a two-point lead to 13. USC ended the half with a seven-point lead.
But the Cougars weren’t done. Following a basket by Simon to start the second half, the Cougars went on a 20-2 run to take a nine-point lead with four minutes remaining in the third quarter. The Trojans were able to stop the bleeding with a layup by Alexis Lloyd and cut the Cougar lead to one at the beginning of the fourth quarter, but the Cougars soon went on another run to extend the lead to eight and never looked back.
“We just lost our focus,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “We didn’t come out ready to play and they outplayed us. They hustled more and just played better than us.”
It was a tale of two halves for Fagbenle. After finishing the first half with 10 points, she was held scoreless as the Women of Troy were outscored by 19 in the second half.
“They made her work extremely hard,” Cooper-Dyke said. “They double-teamed her, played extremely physical and we didn’t do a good job of getting her the ball.”
With the loss, USC is now 14-3 and 2-3 in conference play. Jordan Adams has not played in all three losses. USC faces a tough upcoming schedule with games against Washington, No. 11 Stanford, and Cal.
