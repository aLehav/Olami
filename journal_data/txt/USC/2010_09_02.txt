After its return from a grueling trip to sweltering Texas, the USC women’s soccer team (1-1-1) hopes that its inspired play last weekend will carry over to the Fullerton Tournament this weekend. On Friday, the Women of Troy will play a 5 p.m. game against No. 18 UNC Greensboro (3-0-0). After a day off, they will return to the same pitch for an 11 a.m. clash with Purdue (2-1-1) on Sunday.

According to Soccer America, No. 18 UNC Greensboro is the first nationally ranked team that the Women of Troy will compete against this season. Though early-season national rankings can be fickle, the Spartans still represent the Women of Troy’s toughest opponent on the young season. With victories against East Carolina and Utah, as well as a 2-1 upset over Wake Forest that launched it into the top 20, UNC Greensboro is off to the best start in its program’s history. Junior goalkeeper Kelsey Kearney has saved 14 of 15 shots launched at her, while sophomore forward Tabitha Padgett leads a diverse scoring attack with two goals.
No slouch itself, Purdue possesses a 2-1-1 record after tying Miami 1-1 and beating St. Bonaventure 4-1 last week. Junior midfielders Lauren Montenegro and Kellie Phillips and sophomore forward Marta Lynch are all players to watch in this match, as each has tallied two goals so far.
In regard and adjustments he plans to make for the Fullerton Tournament, coach Ali Khosroshahin said he had none.
“We don’t have any adjustments for this weekend, but we’re trying to get better at taking care of the ball. Playing a player down [in last week’s game against the Texas Longhorns] opened the players’ eyes a little bit. It showed them what they’re capable of.”
Although the team does not plan to make any tactical adjustments, Khosroshahin will have to alter his lineup to replace freshman center back Allie Harrison, who cannot play against UNC Greensboro after receiving a red card against Texas. Expected to replace Harrison in the backfield is senior forward Megan Ohai.
True to form thus far this season, Khosroshahin has not broken down scouting reports of opponents during practices. When asked for a scouting report on the two teams, Khosroshahin said he had one, but had not yet even glanced at it.
“We really don’t look at [scouting reports]. We just worry about ourselves,” Ohai said. “On the day before or on the day of the game, we’ll briefly go over that stuff.”
With strong performances this weekend, the Women of Troy, already recipients of votes for Soccer America’s top 20, can find themselves once again in the national contender discussion. A team that figures only to improve as the season progresses and as its young talent matures, USC women’s soccer faces a challenging schedule this weekend. This team, however, has proven so far that it will not let the title of “underdog” diminish its vigor.

Until Thursday, the USC football team hadn’t played a game for exactly 250 days.
Long time, isn’t it? Dec. 26, 2009 to Sept. 2, 2010.
Really quite a bit of time. So much happened between those two games, too.
Don’t believe me?
Let’s get to it. I think you’ll find the course of the events resembles a wooden roller coaster.
So, the Trojans won that game in December against Boston College in the Emerald Bowl. Of course, even playing in that game was fairly out of character for USC, which had won seven consecutive Pac-10 championships and thus qualified for seven consecutive Rose Bowls.
Fast forward two weeks to get the first shock of the offseason, quarterback Aaron Corp, who, just five short months earlier, was slated to be the Trojans’ starting signal-caller. On Jan. 8, Corp announced plans to transfer to the University of Richmond, where he would go on to win the starting job.
Little did Corp know that if he had only waited until June, he would’ve been able to freely transfer to any out-of-conference school in the nation without being forced to sit out a year.
But we’ll get to that.
Anyway, Corp transferred on a Friday. By Sunday, rumors were floating — no, swirling — that then-coach Pete Carroll would resign to coach the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks.
On Monday, the first day of the spring semester, those rumors were confirmed. Carroll held a final press conference in the Heritage Hall auditorium, where he defended his “business” decision.
By Wednesday, former Athletic Director Mike Garrett — we’ll get to him soon — had named a replacement, former USC assistant Lane Kiffin.
Kiffin, of course, brought with him a significant following —both bad and good — frenzied by his whirlwind departure from Knoxville, Tenn. Death threats to Kiffin and his wife occurred. In one memorable moment, a Tennessee transplant observing his opening press conference outside Heritage Hall expressed a lack of understanding to how Kiffin could so openly betray Volunteer fans.
Kiffin had three weeks to re-recruit the Trojans’ 2010 class, and he did so with gusto — securing the commitments of Seantrel Henderson, Nickell Robey and Markeith Ambles, among others.
All-everything freshmen Kyle Prater and Dillon Baxter even enrolled early.
The next month, a number of current and former USC staffers met with NCAA investigators in Tempe, Ariz., for an official hearing relating to the Reggie Bush case and a supposed lack of institutional control.
Present that weekend were Carroll and then-running backs coach Todd McNair, who brought along his legal counsel. We wondered why at the time.
Also at that time, I wrote in this very column: “The worst-case scenario … is some combination of sanctions that force the football team to vacate the wins from past years, lose scholarships and a ban from postseason play for the next few seasons.”
Whoops.
Anyway, the NCAA was expected to report back with their findings sometime in mid-April. The Trojans proceeded with spring practice, which came and went without too much hullabaloo — although hotshot then-freshman quarterback Matt Barkley did hurt his hand (gasp!) on teammate Jurrell Casey’s helmet during the spring scrimmage at the Coliseum. Senior defensive tackle Christian Tupou, the backbone of the Trojan defense, also went down in that game and was lost for the season with a knee injury.
That was May 1.
On June 10, the NCAA report was finally released — slapping USC with a two-year bowl ban, a loss of 30 scholarships that takes effect next year and a vacation of past wins.
The Trojans were placed on four years’ probation — and all USC juniors and seniors were allowed to transfer to Football Bowl Subdivision schools without sitting out a year. Many of them would do so over the next two months.
As far as a response, Kiffin announced immediate plans to appeal, Garrett told a reporter he wasn’t worried about his job but the reporter should be worried about his own, and USC fans grieved.
At one point, Thursday’s game wasn’t even supposed to happen. The NCAA threatened to take away the Trojans’ 13th game because of stated penalties limiting teams on probation to only 12 games a season.
But it stayed.
Then, on a lazy Tuesday in mid-July, news broke that new university president C.L. Max Nikias would replace Garrett with former Trojan quarterback Pat Haden.
Haden brought with him a scot-free reputation for success in many ventures of life — giving USC a positive spin heading into fall camp, set to begin on Aug. 4. Before that, however, two other things had to happen.
Kiffin made news again with the hiring of Tennessee Titans running backs coach — and USC alum — Kennedy Pola, allegedly going behind Titans’ coach Jeff Fisher’s back to do so.
Tennessee actually filed a lawsuit, which brings us to the second thing that happened: Pac-10 Media Day, where Kiffin wore shades at the podium on the Rose Bowl field and limited the shock value of his remarks — until late in the lunch session with reporters, when he dropped the nugget that he thought the Titans sued simply because of the state in which they were located.
That gave sports talk hosts material for a couple days.
Things that made news during camp: Senior fullback Stanley Havili was suspended for a day for his role in an altercation with junior cornerback T.J. Bryant, freshman defensive back Patrick Hall was suspended indefinitely for unspecified reasons and Kiffin made practices tackle-free to limit injuries.
An eventful eight months for sure — all leading up to Thursday.
Voilá.

The incessant chatter hasn’t stopped. Eight months removed from a 7-6 win over UCLA in the NCAA championship game to secure a second consecutive national title, talk of a possible three-peat in 2010 hasn’t subsided in the least. For the No. 4 USC men’s water polo team, that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
High expectations are the norm.
Experience · Redshirt sophomore two-meter Brian Boswell, who was part of both championship teams, is expected to lead USC this season. - Joel Zink | Daily Trojan 
“We have a really good shot at three-peating,” said junior two-meter Matt Burton. “Everyone’s been working really hard this summer, so I think you’ll see us in the NCAA finals again this year.”
Burton’s confidence shouldn’t come as a surprise. Over the last two seasons, USC has compiled an overall mark of 55-2 en route to two NCAA championships. It is arguably the best two-year run in program history. But for now, the Trojans’ focus is planted solely on its season opening matchups against Redlands and Whittier as a part of this weekend’s UCI Invitational at the Anteater Complex in Irvine, Calif.
“All our guys are highly motivated, and have the same dreams and aspirations,” Burton said. “We’re going at this as hard as we ever have.”
Though there is little to question about the team’s work ethic, the 2010 Trojans remain somewhat of an enigma, largely an inexperienced unit after the loss of eight seniors from a season ago.
“This is a young group,” coach Jovan Vavic said. “We’ll really need all our younger guys to step up.”
Some players, such as redshirt sophomores two-meter Brian Boswell and driver Michael Rosenthal, have championship-level experience and were a part of USC’s previous NCAA title runs. However, neither Boswell nor Rosenthal had a starting role where the team’s success was dependent upon his scoring and defensive performance.
“They’ll need to do a great job this year,” Vavic said.
Playing top-notch defense and remaining fundamentally sound are arguably the most important focuses for this USC team. The two major difficulties it will face include opening the season on the road and simultaneously breaking in a new starting unit with just three returners: goalie Joel Dennerley, driver Peter Kurzeka and Burton, all juniors.
“If we’re going to go out and win, it’s going to have to be defensive-oriented,” Burton said.
Vavic echoed similar sentiments.
“We’re going to have to play a different style than before,” the veteran coach said. “We’ll need to play great defense, as well as rely a lot on [Dennerley].”
But neither challenge should be overly tasking for USC. A year ago, the Trojans ranked first in the nation in team defense, allowing just 5.5 goals per game. In addition,  they’ll once again feature Dennerley in goal, and Vavic has great confidence in the player, calling Dennerley the best he’s ever coached at the position.
“He does whatever he needs to do to prepare,” Vavic said. “He’s very conscientious and doesn’t leave things to accident. It’s really what separates him.”
With enough familiar faces returning and an influx of talent into the rotation, it’s easy to see why swagger has become synonymous with the Trojan program as it begins its quest for a three-peat just down the road in Irvine.

It is a rare feeling to be surprised by films these days. In the age of the Internet, instant information-sharing is taking over the world — not that there’s anything wrong with that. But still, I’d venture that about 95 percent of the time, if not more, I more or less know how I’m going to feel about a movie before I even step foot inside the theater. The film itself generally only confirms my previously held beliefs.
Natural crisis · Beautiful Islands visits various locales such as Alaska to show the deterioration of their resources, letting the footage and the locations’ residents to explain the consequence of global warming. - Photo courtesy of Horizon Features 
The remaining 5 percent, however, is why I watch movies.
Beautiful Islands by Japanese filmmaker Tomoko Kana is part of that 5 percent.
Going in, my expectations of the film — a documentary about global warming — were not high. Like many others, I am worn out by the seemingly endless parade of An Inconvenient Truth imitators who trot out the same tired rhetoric time after time after time, pounding the same dry facts into my skull, turning my brain to mush, rendering me more or less apathetic about the whole thing.
Beautiful Islands is different. It knows how to shut up, get out of the way and allow the beauty of nature unfold before the screen — and make an argument on its own behalf that’s more compelling than any windblown, second rate, left-wing university professor/environmentalist/whatever could ever hope to make.
Yes, Beautiful Islands is indeed beautiful. For 106 minutes it captures the reality of three disparate locales: Tuvalu in the South Pacific, Venice in Italy and Shishmaref in Alaska. Each place is threatened by the effects of climate change, either by rising tides or receding ice floes.
But the story is told silently. There is no soundtrack, no narration, little talking in general and certainly no music. The only things we hear are the islands themselves. The wind rustling gently through the palm trees of Tuvalu. Water lapping against the bricks of the Piazza San Marco. Ice floes collapsing in Shishmaref.
The only words we ever hear are spoken by the islanders themselves, and regardless of where they reside — on a poor island nation or in a highly cultured western city — they repeat the same mantra: “Surely,  God would not allow our way of life to be destroyed.”
But not everyone feels the same about the simplicity of the documentary.
Read most any negative review (and there are, unfortunately, more than a few), and they almost universally criticize Beautiful Islands for being what it’s not: liberal propaganda.
Perhaps I’m wrong, but I fail to see how a film with no soundtrack, that tells its story exclusively from the perspective of an impartial observer could possibly be considered propaganda. No doubt the attitude of the director can be inferred from the subject matter, but still.
The explicitly stated purpose of Beautiful Islands is to capture the beauty of nature before it is lost forever. How is this propaganda?
I blame environmentalists. So if you stand in the middle of the political road (like I do), and despise propaganda on either side, and one of your environmentally inclined friends drags you to this film, I recommend that you keep him (or her) locked in the trunk of your car so that you can enjoy the film in peace.
There. I’m done. Rant over.
To put it simply, go see this film. Relax and enjoy the scenery as Tomoko Kana takes you on a beautiful journey around the world. It is a rare blessing to be treated to raw footage as beautiful as this. This is real life, and that is something rarely seen in movies. Beautiful Islands takes you from a tribal ceremony in the South Pacific, to a masquerade ball in Italy, to a seal hunt in Alaska.
How many films can do that?  How many films can capture that subtle thread of unity that runs through humanity, regardless of race, class or tradition? The answer is, not many. So don’t allow your preconceived notions to color your opinion of this film. You’re doing yourself a disservice if you do, for the beauty stands on its own.

Whoever said the Germans don’t have a sense of humor is wrong. But there just might be a truth to the beer-nuzzling and kinky German stereotype, at least according to Soul Kitchen, a comedy from Turkish-German filmmaker Fatih Akin, which opens in theaters today.
Viewers who have never watched Akin’s previous works might be surprised to find out that his two previous award-winning films, Head-On and The Edge of Heaven, dealt with serious topics such as loss and depression. Not to say Soul Kitchen doesn’t deal with loss and depression as well — it just handles the subjects in a light-hearted way, meeting the characters’ anguish with only more chuckles.
Soul Kitchen is the name of the restaurant run by Zinos Kazantzakis (Adam Bousdoukos). The movie centers on the ups and downs of this creaky diner in an obscure area in Hamburg, where the extensive menu offers 40 different kinds of dishes — all of which are frozen, dehydrated and smothered in the same cream sauce. Every night, Zinos, the lone chef in the house, frantically plops frozen fish sticks into a household deep fryer and spoons out store-bought potato salad onto mismatched plates.
Things could be better, but Zinos is satisfied. He has a loyal gathering of customers and he forms a comfortable alliance with his two loyal employees. But unexpected trials start confronting him in a continuous chain, testing Zinos’ opportunistic nature. Each misfortune, however, is injected with slapstick comedy and lewd humor.
His gorgeous girlfriend, Nadine (Pheline Roggan) leaves for Shanghai, resorting to steamy Skype sessions to keep their relationship going. He breaks his back while trying to move a broken dishwasher. His crooked brother Illias (Moritz Bleibtreu) turns up, paroled, begging for a job so he can stay out of jail. But that’s not the end of it.
Soul Kitchen, the only thing Zinos really owns, is in trouble. A tax collector shows up and confiscates the sound system. Zinos hires a new chef, Shayn (Birol Unel), to cook while Zinos mends his back, but the unshaven, salt-and-pepper-haired chef is a temperamental food snob who was fired from a high-end restaurant after he answered a customer asking for microwaved gazpacho with a butcher knife.
When faced with Zinos’ processed-food-loving crowd, Shayn denounces the group as “culinary racists,” telling it to get pizza at the supermarket instead. Unsurprisingly, all of the few customers Zinos had leave in a huff, presumably to the nearest supermarket.
Then Zinos’ thuggish old friend Neumann (Wotan Wilke Möhring) shows up in his gleaming Audi and uses every unscrupulous way imaginable to coax Zinos into selling his restaurant so he can flatten it to build a brothel.
It’s drama after drama. From robberies to sibling betrayals to a funeral crashing — and even a full-out orgy party thanks to an aphrodisiac dessert overdose. All of this is hilariously interjected with Zinos’ crippled hobble and plenty of shot glasses.
The most engaging quality about this movie, however, is not the brisk, enthusiastic plot but its endearing characters. No matter how wicked, flawed or exasperating the characters are, every one of them is so real and sincere that one can’t help becoming emotionally invested in them.
Shayn, despite his hotheadedness, is passionate about his craft, and patiently teaches Zino how to properly julienne zucchini and whip egg whites to a stiff peak. Illias might be a thief and compulsive gambler, but he has sweet, goofy moments that touch the audience’s heart. And of course there’s Zinos, the 21st-century Job, who bears all calamity with as much dignity as he fails to muster.
Akin also has a way with handling the camera that moves seamlessly with the characters. It twists and turns together with the character’s movements, sometimes abruptly zooming in and out to add an element of surprise or suspense. But when it is focused on a female character, the camera turns soft, almost seeming to caress their curves and natural faces with a seductive glow, as if to defy Hollywood’s rail-thin beauty standards.
The music — a vibrant, eclectic mixture of blues, R&B, rock ‘n’ roll and hip-hop — is also appropriately chosen to fit the movie’s modern, multicultural spirit. For non-German speakers, the movie has English subtitles, but it’s worth listening to the deep, throaty language, which suddenly loses the crude harshness that German is mistakenly known for. Instead, the language takes on a delightful, soulful quality that befits the expressive moods and emotions of the characters.
Soul Kitchen might be based around the restaurant, but it really is a fine-tuning of the different tastes and seasonings of each character’s personality. Shayn has a favorite saying: “The traveler hasn’t reached his destination yet.” That’s what the movie is all about — a soulful, continuous journey in savoring all that life has to offer.
Another great review! Soul Kitchen seems like one of those movies that always has something going on, never a dull moment type of movie. You always find the perfect words to get your message across, “it really is a fine-tuning of the different tastes and seasonings of each character’s personality.” Say no more my friend :-)
[…] Ever heard of Soul Kitchen? I think whether you’re a foodie or not, German or non-German, you’ll love this movie. Check […]

For students whose culinary choices peak at the Burrito Ultimo or the Six Dollar Burger, the Ronald Tutor Campus Center’s brand-new Lemonade might seem daunting — beets with pickled red onions and hazelnut vinaigrette, broccoli and ricotta with a champagne vinaigrette, and cantaloupe and Persian cucumbers with prosciutto and arugula. And that is just the side selection.
Spicing things up · Lemonade offers delicious and equally creative options such as Israeli couscous with truffle oil and Parmesan cheese, as well as a grilled ham sandwich with manchego and quince preserves. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
Open to a very busy lunch crowd, Lemonade also offers meaty braises, crustless quiches, grilled sandwiches, fresh soups, desserts and, of course, an impressive selection of lemonade.
The menu is so sweeping that Lemonade would leave a single food critic overwhelmed. That is why we bring you two — two foodies who hacked our way through Lemonade’s sides and sweets — and discovered what is currently USC’s best dining option.

Sophia: The concept is simple. Bring together that old-fashioned lemonade stand nostalgia with fresh, innovative cooking, and you have a modern cafeteria for those seeking something more adventurous than chicken nuggets.
You grab a tray, line up, point at what you want, and the cafeteria workers plop food into your plate — except your servers actually smile, and they don’t serve mystery meat. All the food here is made from scratch with quality ingredients, and instead of looking like alien mush, they form an edible, colorful work of art on your plate.
Mimi: Right off the bat, the open-view line of various marketplace salads caught our eye. From quinoa to sweet potatoes to beets, these salads aren’t just a plate of tossed lettuce.
Sophia: Many vegetables might be strange to the common diner, from hearts of palm to spaghetti squash to watermelon radish. If you couldn’t handle Brussels sprouts as a child, try Lemonade’s upgraded version — Brussels tossed in a sticky, tangy balsamic dressing and thinly shaved Parmesan cheese. These aren’t your average boiled cabbage balls.
Mimi: Likewise, the Israeli couscous is coated in truffle oil and Parmesan cheese, and the cauliflower comes mixed with raisins and curry powder. For sides, the beets with hazelnuts are an earthy and delicious combo. The broccoli, sharing plate space with ricotta cubes, is zesty and sweet.
A great feature of the sides menu is that you can split portions. For example, one portion can be half a lentil dish and half a butternut squash dish — perfect for the indecisive lunch-goer.
You can also choose cold proteins to go with your salads. Any cafeteria that dares to serve half-raw ahi tuna has confidence in its quality. The seared ahi tuna with citrus ponzu dressing is particularly good, though another popular entree was the buttermilk chicken.
Sophia: If you’re still ambivalent toward raw tuna, have a hand on Lemonade’s sandwiches. Just don’t expect PB&Js. Lemonade puts its own unique twist on traditional sandwiches.
The boring ham and cheese sandwich is transformed into a sandwich of grilled ham, manchego and quince preserves on chewy rosemary bread. Sick of tuna salad? Try one with crunchy cucumbers and creamy green tartar on rich potato bread. For vegetarians, they also offer a mozzarella, tomato, basil and sherry focaccia sandwich, a slight tweak on classic Italian flavors.
Mimi: For the meat lovers, Lemonade also has a selection of hot braises, from the exotic red miso beef short ribs as well as a lamb tagine with figs, apricot and almonds, to comfort food catchalls like beef stroganoff and turkey in gravy. The robust red miso beef short rib was a standout, and hearty enough to tide even the most muscly football player over until dinner.
Of course, there is the titular lemonade. Lemonade scores points for interesting flavor combos, such as watermelon rosemary and peach ginger. The actual drinks, however, will bring a diabetic back from depths of a blood sugar crash. Seriously, it took my roommate three hours to finish hers.
Save some sugar room for dessert. Forget cast-off stale pie slices from most cafeterias. Lemonade smirks at your waistline with an army of towering cakes, cookies, fruit, nut bars, brownies and macaroons. The macaroons in particular are a perfect end to a nice lunch — think of an elegant whoopie pie. The filling is a sweet layer of buttercream, and the pastry is light and chewy. The pistachio was the standout among chocolate and caramel.
Sophia: One word of advice about the peanut butter milk chocolate crunch bars: Resist — for a while. Pick one up, sprint back home to stick into your freezer and then distract yourself for about an hour. It’s good by itself, but delicious served cold and hard. The peanut butter and milk chocolate on top becomes a sticky, creamy layer of fudge, and the rice crispy crust gets chewy and crunchy at the same time.
By the time you’ve piled your tray high and reached the registers, be mentally prepared for the price. Yes, it’s fast food, but Lemonade is hardly the dollar menu. Expect to pay at least $9 (plus tax) for a single sandwich and about $4 for your macaroon. But for the quality and quantity they serve you, the price is justified. Lemonade is heavy on the helpings as well as on flavor. It’s not a place you want to break the bank on every single day, but if you’re looking for a break from Subway foot-long sandwiches, or want the occasional self-pampering treat, Lemonade is the place to pucker up.
—
Pucker up soon, however, because word is getting around about Lemonade, and the crowds are getting larger. Blake Wills, a sophomore majoring in economics, was already on his second trip.
“I’m here for both the flavor and the health factor,” he said. “This place is great. I’ll definitely be back often.”
As of now, Lemonade is only open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., which gives USC students just four hours to squeeze in and stake out a spot in the small eatery. One student arrived a few minutes too late and found the doors already locked.
But packed tables mean satisfied eaters. Use the time spent in line to plot out your lunch — you’re going to need it. But no need to stress. Most of the food is delicious, and a great adventure for both eaters and foodies alike.
Wow! Either you two definitely know how to write, and make food sound great, or this place really is as great as it sounds and just made your job that much easier. I think it was a bit of both ;-). I wants me some Lemonade :-P. Great review ladies!
[…] Check out the review on Lemonade that Mimi and I co-wrote together! I think we make a dynamic writing team. The editor liked it so […]
[…] as well pimp the review Sophia and I wrote for it… Which randomly inspired me to make a Ginger-Nectarine Omelet  […]

The Keck School of Medicine’s epidemiological cancer surveillance research program has been awarded $23.5 million of federal funding to advance its research.
Granted · The USC Department of Preventative Medicine will use the $23.5 million to fund epidemiology research at USC’s cancer center. - Neha Jain | Daily Trojan
The USC Department of Preventative Medicine has received funding since 1992, but this award provides the epidemiological program with enough financial stability to continue research in the coming years.
“Most funding comes from the government and typically only for one to three years, so you are constantly unsure of what you will do five years from now and [unable] to count on seven years of funding,” said Dennis Deapen, director of the Cancer Surveillance Program.
The program, part of the National Cancer Institute, will receive the award over the course of seven years.
“This funding allows me and my colleagues to focus on our researching instead of writing new grants. We hope to not only be able to help those people who have cancer but to also prevent cancer from starting,” Deapen said.
About 65 faculty, staff and graduate students from USC, UCLA and other area universities also involved in the institute’s research on cancer prevention, eye diseases, childhood obesity and cardiovascular problems, among other health issues.
“Each researcher will obtain names of cancer patients from [a] hospital and then the researcher will ask the patient if he or she would like to be interviewed about risk factors from their diet, to exercise, to family medical history,” Deapen said.
The researchers look at how trends and patterns differ by racial groups, age groups and sexes. The main goal of the program is to make a surveillance registry and electronic account of all cases of cancer in hopes of discovering methods to prevent cancer in other individuals.
As the number of cancer cases continues to increase, Deapen said he believes the funding from the recent grant will help in discovering breakthroughs in cancer research, which could improve the quality of life of cancer patients.
“I love this position because it gives me a chance to both direct a program and to research in the program,” Deapen said. “The funding will truly make sure that it is high quality, timely and invested in the overall quality of the community.”
Loraine Agustin, a student researcher for the program who is pursuing a doctorate in epidemiology, said she was glad to hear about the funding and to be a part of the program.
“I decided to stay at USC because the research is exactly what I want to do and Los Angeles has such diversity in ethnicities for what we are studying,” Agustin said. “I’m very happy because I am getting full benefits, and I can explain and share my research to the community.”

USC’s Graduate and Professional Student Senate officials say they hope to create a greater sense of community among graduate and professional students on both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses in the upcoming year.
Office space · The Graduate and Professional Student Senate has moved to a new location in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. - Hayden Bennett | Daily Trojan 
This year, the GPSS offices moved from room 103 of the Student Union to room 224 of the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center, with the new graduate student lounge just two floors above.
“I love it,” GPSS President Jenny Novak said. “I like being located close to USG, like being close to the center of campus, like being close to the lounge.”
GPSS plans to work with all departments this year to foster a community relationship within the university and with alumni. GPSS also hopes to focus on improving social programming, creating a better subsidized transit system, fostering “green” initiatives and increasing summer funding for doctoral students. This year, GPSS is working with a budget of about $1 million, Novak said.
GPSS also hopes to improve its campus visibility.
“It’s still very common to ask a grad student about GPSS and they will have no idea what it is,” Vice President Aliya Hussaini said.
To achieve a greater sense of graduate student community, Public Relations Chair Swati Gupta hopes to focus on leadership events within the graduate student body, including summits, networking opportunities and a new leadership initiative she calls “Project ‘Why?’”
Other upcoming activities include a NFL kickoff party, a boat trip, an ice cream social, a community service trip to the L.A. County Fair with the Undergraduate Student Government, academic workshops and Grad Bar nights.
On Grad Bar nights, GPSS will bring students from USC, UCLA and Caltech together to go to bars around Los Angeles.
Though GPSS is the graduate counterpart to USG, Novak said she thinks that working with graduate students is different than working with undergraduates.
“A lot of graduate students are older, so there’s a difference in maturity … graduate students are [also] more segregated by programs,” she said. “They have bigger [academic] projects and a different lifestyle … It’s difficult to build a community.”
Gupta said graduate students don’t want as many social activities as undergraduates, but still have the same needs, including later operating hours at Doheny Library and more “off-campus ventures.” They also have unique improvements they’d like to see, such as increased technical training for teacher’s assistants and a way to bridge the gap between distance and on-campus learning.
“[Graduate students have] a lot more work, [and they’re] not looking to get involved,” Gupta said. “[Academics are] more important for them.”
GPSS is also trying to take advantage of its new graduate student lounge, specifically through different events. Weekly lunches are held Mondays in the lounge where students bring their lunches and GPSS provides free coffee and dessert.
“I think the grad lounge is a great addition to the campus center and really shows that GPSS is trying to unify all of the disciplines of graduate students and allow for more conversations and interactions,” said Ben Kastroll, a graduate student studying engineering management.

A record-breaking number of USC students registered for this year’s sorority and fraternity fall recruitment, according to the Interfraternity and Panhellenic councils.
What a rush · Greek members relax at a the Tri-Delt sorority welcome back barbecue Thursday afternoon. Fraternities and sororities saw record rush numbers this year. - Jessica Granger | Daily Trojan 
Almost 1,000 students — 977 — registered for fraternity rush and the 23 fraternities gave out a record number of bids with 476, said Parker Adams, IFC vice president for public relations.
The Panhellenic Council also saw an increase, with about 960 girls registered for sorority recruitment and about 700 girls receiving bids, according to Panhellenic President Laura Redfern.
Alex Bozzo, IFC vice president of recruitment, credited IFC’s new approach to marketing the Greek system to students as the reason behind the increase.
“The type of student USC is attracting is changing and frats have to change how they market themselves,” Bozzo said. “We noticed we’re getting a lot of kids who are first-generation college students whose parents may not be familiar with the Greek system.”
IFC recruitment lasted for one week while Panhellenic’s rush was only five days long.
“As a guy you have to have a more proactive approach to rush and really go out and search for yourself and not just fall into a house,” Adams said.  “The way our rush is structured we really give [potential new members] the freedom to find which house is right for them.”
The rush process for the 10 sororities on The Row is more formal than for fraternities, Redfern said, and not as representative of the Greek system as she would like.
“I definitely think that girls’ recruitment is not the most genuine display of the girls in the house because everything is so staged. It truly is a superficial introduction into a sorority,” Redfern said.  “Thank goodness it’s only five days long, because then after that [the new members] get to really know the girls’ personalities in the house.”
Though Redfern said that “rush is like a circus,” she said she believes the formal structure is the most efficient way to handle recruitment.
“We have to have it so organized and staged because that’s the nature of girls,” Redfern said.  “It wouldn’t be fair if it were as informal as the guys’ recruitment because there would be too much dirty rushing.”
Adams said that the informal process of IFC rush makes it more genuine.
“I like how real our rush is and the guys that are doing it really genuinely want to share their college experiences and their houses with [the rushees],” Adams said. “I know girls make up sentimental stories for rush, but we make it in a way so that rush basically can’t be fake.”
IFC is also hosting a secondary rush event Friday for students who might not have been offered a bid or who did not like the bid they were given.

USC Gould School of Law Professor Elyn Saks saw her expansive legal work in the mental health industry pay off — literally. The MacArthur Foundation selected Saks as a 2009 fellow, giving her $500,000 and no restrictions on what she could spend it on.
Genius · Professor Elyn Saks will use her MacArthur Foundation genius grant to fund the institute. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Saks has decided to use a portion of her winnings to create the Saks Institute for Mental Health Law, Policy and Ethics, a research-based facility that will use a legal lens to focus on critical issues in mental health.
“I am totally honored and so gratified to be able to bring people interested in this issue together,” Saks said.
Faculty members from seven different university departments plan to contribute to the institute’s investigations. Participating departments include psychiatry, psychology, social work, gerontology, philosophy, engineering and law.
With its headquarters at the law school, the institute will feature lectures from mental health experts in the fall semester followed by a spring symposium aimed at producing innovative laws and policies that would expand the rights of mental health patients. The institute will then publish its findings and recommendations for reform.
Saks was one of 24 recipients of the genius grant — the fellowship’s informal name — which the MacArthur Foundation annually awards to individuals who display “exceptional creativity” and “manifest promise for important future advances.”
The foundation evaluates candidates on the significance and scope of their achievements. Saks has published numerous scholarly articles and books, including her 2007 memoir The Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness.
Diagnosed with schizophrenia in her early 20s, Saks possesses the perspective of a patient as well as the legal knowledge of a professional.
According to the MacArthur Foundation’s recipient descriptions, Saks’ firsthand experiences make her an “important contributor to national debates on mental health policy.”
“Saks is a terrific scholar and the ideal person to start this institution,” said Scott Altman, the vice dean of Gould.
Law professor Michael Shapiro, a colleague of Saks’ and a member of her institute’s executive board said she can offer her varied expertise to the institute.
Saks has “a view from everywhere; she is a scholar, teacher, patient and psychologist,” he said.
Shapiro said he believes this unique perspective will set Saks’ institute apart from others.
Saks plans to use her institute to help spread ethical awareness among lawmakers and the general community.
A chief priority will be “getting [patients] rights to refuse treatment and rights to receive expensive treatment,” she said.
The Saks Institute will welcome students to participate in this ongoing project. They will have the opportunity to perform background research, receive stipends and possibly publish their work.
Mechanical restraints in psychiatric hospitals will be the institute’s first topic of concern for the current academic year.
Ultimately, Saks said she hopes to discover how to convince mental health patients to want treatment, so that there will be no need for legal protections against force-feeding and physical restraints.
“It’s a wonderful addition to USC,” said Margaret Gatz, professor of psychology. “Saks’ vision and foresight should be commended.”
This is ONE amazing woman!
She has accomplished more in her life than most

Think back to the memories from freshman year. The good ones, the bad ones and the ones I can only laugh about now — everything was so new and exciting. New faces and friends, trepidation over the unfamiliar academic requirements. I also remember standing on the vast shore of extracurricular options at USC and wondering where to go first.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The summer before freshman year, I was bombarded with e-mails and literature telling me to get involved. It was perplexing to see all these letters take on an almost Harry Potter-esque manner of flying through my mailbox, blanketing my desk with all shades of cardinal and gold. “Get involved,” they cried at me. In what? As an incoming freshman with uninformed expectations of what happens at college, my definition of being involved definitely didn’t seem like something the administration would advocate.
Discovering the true collegiate definition of “getting involved” set my head spinning with all the pressure and possibility packed into the phrase as well as the overstuffed packets USC kept sending to my front door. Promotions for clubs such as the Trojan Knights, Surf Club and all sorts of singing and improve organizations came in constant streams. I, being the conscientious overachiever that I was, felt overwhelmed by the daunting new task of sorting through all the pamphlets and deciding which clubs and organizations to join.
Turns out there are even more organizations than the ones advertised. “USC has almost 700 recognized student organizations,” boasts SCampus, the student guidebook. For whatever interest you might have, there’s an organization for that. If you’re into the whole leadership thing, try Building Government. Want to get more acquainted with a higher power? There are plenty of religious groups. If you want to kick that two-left-feet habit you’ve been sporting since middle school, try salsa dancing.
Now, for some students, involvement translates into résumé-building. I know I have sometimes fallen captive to this mindset, raising my hand compulsively when a professor asks for team leaders or club starters, or, better yet, systematically working my way through the involvement fair collecting fliers from every booth — anything to bolster the nebulous and ever-daunting prospect of my future career.
But while a good amount of résumé-building can help quell your fear of the future, a more palpable and potentially less self-serving purpose of involvement is community service. I know a select few people who are truly passionate about community service in one form or another, but the majority of people with whom I’ve discussed the subject take the posture of apologetic undercommitment — we’re very much supportive of the idea, but very regretful that we haven’t yet found a means or time to do much community service.
But here again, there’s a solution for that — student organizations can provide the answer. Some organizations that exist for other purposes, notably the Emerging Leaders Program, often coordinate community service events for students in exactly the quandary mentioned above.
In an effort to practice what I preach, I’m going to pick one of the community service options and let you know how it works out during the semester. You should, too.
However we choose to plug-in — as an upperclassman wanting to try something new or as an incoming freshman just figuring out where to fit in — involvement at USC can be a fun and often easy way to do some great things while you’re still on campus. And it’s yet another reason to get excited about being a Trojan.

I thought the article was well written
Hmm the intro doesn’t really make sense. The subject is not consistent throughout the first paragraph. It changes from an imperative to the reader to something more introspective and personal without any transition. I don’t know but something just doesn’t flow right to me…

At first glance, the presence of an 18-plus on-campus bar at a school that has a zero-tolerance underage drinking policy seems contradictory. Yet Traditions Bar & Grill, USC’s historic watering hole, has gone to great lengths to prevent on-site underage drinking while ensuring that all students have a fun, safe place to hang out without having to leaving the confines of the campus.
Traddies, as it’s affectionately called by students, faculty and alumni, has a new look to go along with its new location in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The combination of bar and general lounge area makes it a perfect spot to spend time with friends and meet new people, whether at a concert or during a game of pool.
The fact that students over the age of 18 — but under the legal drinking age — are allowed into the bar has sparked conversation across campus. Traddies never previously allowed underage students access to the venue, and clearly the alcohol policy has not changed. Department of Public Safety officers line the entrance to the bar and check IDs, and with proof of 21-plus identification, you are rewarded with a wristband. This wristband does well in identifying who is allowed to drink, and if that wasn’t enough, more security officers inside keep a watchful eye on the patrons.
The extent of the security on the premises is the main reason why Traddies is right to accommodate underage students. By denying them, the school would be denying those students a concert venue, pool hall and place to eat. Consumption of alcohol is far from the only attribute of the revamped Traddies.
Doubters claim that, once inside, students will inevitably find ways of obtaining alcohol. There is strict security at almost every stop outside Traditions, however, and the security within makes it difficult to exchange wristbands. When I walked into Traddies on a Saturday night and took a step toward the bar to check out the televisions and seating area, a security guard immediately instructed me to head toward the other side of the venue and away from the bar. Once students get a good look at the tight security, they probably won’t even bother trying to get alcohol. A huge deterrent, on top of the security, is the sanctions that could be imposed on students caught with alcohol in Traddies — the most severe of which is expulsion from the university. If an underage student was looking to get drunk, I doubt he would go to an on-campus bar and risk buying alcohol right in front of DPS.
Skeptics also insist the heightened security at Traddies will force underage students to go to liquor stores or other bars in supposedly dangerous areas for an opportunity to drink. But Traddies in fact provides an alternative to off-campus bars, by giving students a great place to relax and pass the time in a safe environment — even if they can’t drink.
Let’s face it: Students are going to find ways to drink, whether on university premises or not. A zero-tolerance policy can only do so much and alcohol-related incidents are not uncommon. But the student body is intelligent enough to recognize the strict security at Traddies and know this isn’t the place to drink if you are underage.

Machete  [rated R]
Remember those gloriously tacky fake trailers that preceded Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino’s ambitious 2007 tribute to exploitation cinema Grindhouse? Fans responded so positively to one particularly outrageous trailer involving illegal immigration, a rifle-toting priest and the craggy-faced Danny Trejo wielding an enormous machete, that Rodriguez made a feature-length version of Machete as his very next project. Joining Trejo are Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan (portraying a nun), the legendary Robert De Niro and the equally legendary Steven Seagal.
The American  [rated R]
George Clooney plays against type for his newest starring role in music video director Anton Corbjin’s thriller, The American. After botching a mission and retiring to the Italian countryside, an assassin (Clooney) falls for a beautiful local woman, forming a relationship that could prove to be extremely dangerous. The breathtaking cinematography has been hailed as reason enough to see this tense character study.
Going the Distance   [rated R]
Drew Barrymore returns in front of the camera after a short stint in the director’s chair for a new romantic comedy. Funnyman Justin Long plays her romantic counterpart who, after meeting the girl of his dreams in New York, attempts to keep the newly developed relationship afloat after he travels back home to San Francisco. Comedic veterans Jason Sudeikis, Christina Applegate and Ron Livingston round out an impressive cast.
The Tillman Story [rated R]
In 2002, NFL player Pat Tillman turned down a contract worth millions of dollars to enlist in the United States Army and fight in Iraq. On April 22, 2004, Tillman was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan. This documentary reveals the U.S. government’s attempt to cover-up the specifics behind Tillman’s death from the soldier’s family and the rest of America in order to maintain an unspoiled heroic story. The film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at last year’s Sundance Film Festival.

Tonight’s game kicks off at 8:00 on the West Coast and 5:00 Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time (HST).  All updates will be timestamped using local time. Be sure to check out our Twitter feed for instant info at www.twitter.com/dailytrojan
8:40-(49-30 USC)- TOUCHDOWN USC! After a series in which backup quarterback Mitch Mustain engineered a dismal drive followed by a Warrior score, Barkley came back in the game and it paid off immediately. He handed the ball off to tailback Marc Tyler, who zig and zagged through the defense for a 44-yard touchdown run. This game is over.
8:18– (42-23 USC)- USC takes over at its own 44-yard line after a Hawaiian drive that went up and back thanks to some big plays on both sides of the ball. Lane Kiffin is pulling his starters and the second string unit is out there, with quarterback Mitch Mustain leading the way. Barkley finishes the game 18-23 for 257 yards and 5 touchdowns. If there were any doubts, he put those away today. The kid is here.
8:01- (42-23 USC)- TOUCHDOWN USC- end of 3rd quarter! And just like that the Trojans scored with a 4-play, 79-yard drive that took just 1:27. The Hawaiian defense has got to be demoralized. Barkley completed a 3 yard pass to Johnson for the score. That gives Barkley 5 touchdowns on the day, which ties a school record held by 4 other people. Johnson isn’t having a shabby day himself, as his 3 touchdown catches ties a school record held by a lot of other people. And that doesn’t take into account his punt return for a touchdown. Seems like the only outcome in doubt is whether the Trojans will cover the 21.5 point spread.
7:55- (34-23 USC)- TOUCHDOWN Hawaii. Quarterback Bryant Moniz gets the lights knocked out of him on a 13 yard run to the five yard line by linebacker Michael Morgan, but backup Brent Rausch comes in and executes a two-play drive capped by a one-yard touchdown run by Alex Green. But the Trojan offense is back on the field and Barkley just completed a 15 yard pass to Ronald Johnson when he rolled out to the right. He followed that by a 49 yard pass down the right sideline to fullback Stanley Havili. The Trojans are once again responding to a Hawaiian score with a quick, efficient drive.
7:34– (34-16 USC)- TOUCHDOWN USC! Just when it looked like Hawaii might threaten to score, Ronald Johnson returns a punt 89 yards for a touchdown. The punt was short and high and it looked like most of the Hawaiian team expected him to fair catch it. Only he didn’t and proceeded to break a few tackles and outsprint the rest of the coverage down the sideline for his third touchdown of the game (2 receiving, one punt return). This most likely seals the deal for USC tonight. The offense has looked too sharp and disciplined and the defense has proved it can play really well at times.
7:30– (27-16 USC)- The third quarter has started and Marc Tyler was a shoestring tackle away from scoring a 70+ yard touchdown. He’s at 98 yards right now and poised to go over 100 yards for the first time in his career at USC. The Trojans were forced to punt and now Hawaii is threatening after a 47-yard pass on 3rd and 25 from the 8-yard line (it was a free play thanks to a defensive lineman jumping offsides and Hawaii quarterback Bryant Moniz just heaved it up there and Salas caught it near midfield).
7:00- (27-16 USC)- HALFTIME. The Warriors almost closed the half with a touchdown but receiver Greg Salas was down at the one and the call stood after an official review. Hawai’i closed the half with a field goal.
The Trojans are looking good on offense, especially Barkley who’s having a heck of a game.  Barkley lost 10 pounds in the offseason and it shows, as he’s scrambled multiple times to complete long passes. Overall, he’s 15-for-19 for 190 yards and 4 touchdowns. Two of those touchdowns were to senior receiver Ronald Johnson, who was almost forgotten about in the preseason. Marc Tyler is shredding the defense as well, rushing 11 times for 70 yards.
On the defensive side, the Trojans are showing the effects of not having tackled anyone for weeks. Hawaiian receiver Greg Salas has caught numerous balls over the middle and simply out-run or breezed past multiple defenders. Missed tackles are the story thus far but the defense has held Hawaii to just 16 points, although it could be more. The biggest surprise of this game is the relative emptiness of the stadium. It gets loud but it’s only about 75 percent filled up.
6:43- (27-13 USC)- We’re back! Thanks to a super cool TimeWarner guy we now have internet again. Since we left you, Barkley has thrown 2 more touchdowns, one to Rhett Ellison and one to Ronald Johnson and he now is 15-19 for 190 yards and 4 touchdowns. The offense is moving the ball with little opposition but the defense still is having trouble tackling.
Update: The Internet is currently down at Aloha Stadium. We’ll begin posting as soon as we can. We’re able to update our Twitter feed more reliably — www.twitter.com/dailytrojan.
5:43– (14-3 USC)- TOUCHDOWN USC! After a solid drive down the field that included 32 yards rushing for Marc Tyler on just four carries, Matt Barkley found senior receiver Ronald Johnson for a one-yard touchdown and then again for the two-point conversion. Defense has got to tackle now.
5:37- (6-3 USC) Hey guys, we are finally up and running after a few technical difficulties but it’s all good because we’re in Hawaii. Anyhow, great start for the offense to the first quarter. Opening drive Barkley throw a 10 yard out route to David Ausberry who was isolated on the right side, broke a tackle and sprinted the rest of the way to the end zone for a 46 yard touchdown (missed XP) . On Hawaii’s next drive, they drove to the 3 yard line before USC’s defnese stopped the Warriors three straight times.

California lawmakers approved a bill Wednesday to ban the automatic pay raises that led to the grossly inflated salaries of Bell City officials.
Pay raises of city officials must now not exceed the cost of living index built into their contracts, according to Assembly Bill 900.
AB 900 will also offer $2.9 million tax refunds to Bell City residents who were overcharged to pay the salaries of officials such as the city manager, who received $800,000 last year.
The bill was written by Assemblyman Kevin De Leon (D- Los Angeles).
Residents of Bell City said they are happy with the outcome of the investigation and legislative action taken after the salary scandal.
“Unfortunately, our city has been labeled as one of the most corrupt cities and poorest,” said 45-year-old Hilda Villalpando to the Los Angeles Times. “But I want my city to be known as the city that led to reformation of the government.”

Today is 9/02/10 — so naturally, something cheesy and Beverly Hills-esque has to occur to celebrate the city’s infamous zip code. And who could be better to help trumpet something pointless than the Kardashians?
The city plans to give the Kardashian-Jenner clan the key to Beverly Hills tonight in an event at the Taste of Beverly Hills Wine and Food Festival, featuring performances by Natasha Bedingfield and Ne-Yo.
Giving away the key to a city is a strange practice that seems to flatter talented people with a big, fake key that doesn’t open anything. It’s confusing, then, that the Kardashians — whose wheelhouse includes selling things, prancing around and arguing on television — are being hailed by the little city synonymous with big name talent.
Sure, lawyer Robert Kardashian was a famous member of O.J. Simpson’s dream team, and daughter Kim made an appearance on Dancing With The Stars (and other videos now circulating around the Internet), but surely Beverly Hills isn’t pressed to honor these fine accomplishments.
Still, the Kardashian’s fame and popularity can’t really be ignored. And hey, Robert Kardashian is part of the Trojan family — which, in a way, makes us all Kardashians.

After spending the offseason answering question after question into a microphone or tape recorder, the Trojans finally get to answer them on the only place it really matters: the field.

The No. 14 Trojans begin the post-Pete Carroll and -sanctions era tonight in Honolulu, against Hawai’i. Kickoff is at 8 p.m. and the game will be nationally televised on ESPN.
Last time the Trojans traveled to Hawaii, they stomped the Warriors 63-17 to begin their defense of the 2004 championship run on a team led by Reggie Bush.
With the fallout from Bush’s actions reverberating through Heritage Hall, expect a very different Trojan team to take the field.
The Lane Kiffin-led Trojans are entering a whole new gridiron landscape where most college football experts expect them to have a down year. Not only is depth an issue — the Trojans have only 74 scholarship players — but NCAA-imposed sanctions prohibit them from playing in a bowl game this season and next.
However, Hawai’i coach Greg McMackin isn’t expecting anything less from USC.
“They’re really focused for this year,” McMackin said in a conference call. “These distractions have really brought them together. We’re expecting their best shot.”
Focused · Lane Kiffin opens his USC head coaching career tonight in Hawaii. Kiffin has previously been the head coach of the Oakland Raiders and the Tennessee Volunteers. He has an all-time record of 12-21 and said he’s never been “more unsure of a team in my life” than this year. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
The Trojans enter the game as a heavy favorite. Their offense, led by sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley, looks to be much improved from a year ago. Barkley has had a strong spring and fall camp and, after being recently voted a team captain, is at the helm of the offensive attack.
Barkley started 12 of 13 games last season, leading the Trojans to a 9-3 record when he was behind center. As the season progressed so did his mistakes. He finished with 15 touchdowns to go with 14 interceptions.
Redshirt junior running back Marc Tyler will make his first start for the Trojans. He beat out senior Allen Bradford for the spot after Bradford was slowed by a knee bruise. Bradford is almost fully recovered and will probably get carries as well.
The starting offensive line, which has been hampered by injuries and depth issues, finally got the chance to practice together as a full unit for the first time Monday. The unit, anchored by senior center Kristofer O’Dowd, is a major concern heading into this season.
“That’s going to be a big question mark,” Kiffin said.
Despite the O-line issues, USC is expected to put up points on the Warriors. It is on the defensive side where things could get a little more uncertain.
Hawai’i employs a run-and-shoot style of offense, which attempts to spread defenses out and relies on short passes to quick receivers. Its attack, led by junior quarterback Bryant Moniz, ranked third nationally in total passing last season and 14th in total offense.
The task will fall on USC’s defense, which was inconsistent at best last season to slow the Hawai’i attack, a task the Warriors’ coach recognizes is a huge challenge.
“A defense can never be right,” McMackin said. “Every route is adjustable. If the quarterback, receivers and running backs get on the same page, it’s tough.”
USC has the right tools in the front seven to disrupt the Hawai’i attack. Junior defensive tackle Jurrell Casey — who is listed on several national watch lists for postseason awards — and defensive ends Wes Horton, a redshirt sophomore, and Armond Armstead, a junior, give the Trojans plenty of firepower up front as they will look to get to Hawai’i quarterback Bryant Minoz.
Behind them, experience reigns as the unit of linebackers- Malcolm Smith, Michael Morgan and Devon Kennard- return from last year. If any of them get hurt, backup Chris Galippo will be more than ready to step into his place.
However, it is behind those front seven where question marks lie. The Trojan secondary features four new starters, three of whom are of sophomore standing or younger.
Adding to the defensive concern for the Trojans is that they have not had many full-contact practices. Kiffin decided a few weeks ago to prohibit tackling because the risk of injury was too great.
“I have never been more unsure of a team in my life,” Kiffin said.
As uncertain as Kiffin is, he’ll finally be getting some answers about his Trojan team tonight.
Regarding the Video summation of USC’s off season troubles, it’s bad enough having to relive recent history without it being presented in such an amateurish fashion. I’m speaking of the narration done by (I presume) a student for whom diction and projection each seem to be skills not yet visited, let alone mastered. I expect better from this university, given the talent pool one would think might be available on campus. 
Bill Baldwin, Jr.
USC 1967
I believe the person doing the narration was perhaps the writer himself. Bill I believe your opinion of summation was just a tad harsh. The video conveyed the information we wanted to know and we must keep in mind who the audience is. The majority of viewers will be students, staff and alums of the university. It is not, in my opinion, intended as a large scale broadcast so it simply can’t be held to those standards. I agree that the narrator should be more careful with diction but we don’t need to overkill things. Either that or find someone else to narrate, but really its not that big a deal. 
Also, are you sure the audio settings on your computer are properly adjusted to hear the video?
tjay…taking money from an agent isnt illegal…its not against the law…
Look at what Reggie Bush (& others like him) have done to OUR team!
Why does he get off scott free? Is it a racial thing? If Bush were white,
I suspect that he’d be behind bars—>prison bars…
not the kind of bars that celebrities frequent, as Bush does.

It sets up like a scene from a Road Runner cartoon.
Wile E. Coyote, the ever-so-cunning and physically superior beast constructs an apparently flawless contraption on the side of a mountain complete with a slingshot, boulders from the set of Raiders of the Lost Ark and 20 sticks of ACME dynamite to catch the speedy Road Runner.
It looks like this is finally the day Wile E. catches his enemy.
Now, replace Wile E. Coyote with the Hawai’i offense and Road Runner with the USC secondary and you’ll see what I’m getting at.
For years, the Warriors have had one of the most potent offenses in the NCAA, but time and again the USC secondary has sped right past them.
There was 2003, when Tommy Chang — who set just about as many NCAA passing records as Wilt Chamberlain had women — and his team marched into the Coliseum, only to get demolished 61-32.
Then there was 2005, when the Trojans traveled down to the islands to face another gunslinger in Colt Brennan, which resulted in a 63-17 domination.
Now it’s 2010, and USC again travels to Hawaii to face a loaded-gun offense. Only, this time, the Warriors have the upper hand. Hawai’i returns an offense complete with veteran players at the skill positions while the Trojans bring a secondary that has a Ph.D. in inexperience.
Junior quarterback Bryant Moniz returns to lead a squad that threw across America. The Warriors ranked third nationally in passing and 14th in total offense in 2009. Moniz was the key component after becoming the starter in October, throwing for 2,396 yards and 14 touchdowns in just eight games.
He probably wouldn’t have been able to put up those numbers, however, if it hadn’t been for the presence of wide receivers Greg Salas and Kealoha Pilares. Salas wears the No. 1 jersey and that’s no coincidence. The 6-foot-2, 210-pound receiver ranked fourth nationally with 1,590 receiving yards and sixth in the nation with 106 receptions. To complicate things, Salas plays in the slot position and not as an outside receiver as someone of his stature usually would.
Moniz, Salas and company will be going up against a secondary that lost all four starters from last year. Senior cornerback Shareece Wright is the most experienced player in the defensive backfield, but even that’s not saying much because he only played in one game last year. He was suspended for the entire season until the bowl game because of academic ineligibility.
In fact, three of the four players slated to start for the Trojans in the secondary — Wright, sophomore safetys Jawanza Starling and T.J. McDonald — had just 10 tackles and one interception combined last season, and that’s not including freshman Nickell Robey. The problem is that those 10 tackles are 10 more than they’ve had since fall camp started, as coach Lane Kiffin hasn’t allowed his team to tackle because of a very thin roster.
The Trojans haven’t been this green in the secondary in recent history, if ever. If Robey starts like he’s supposed to, he will become the first true freshman to start at cornerback since records began being kept after World War II. That’s how thin and inexperienced the Trojans are at that position.
Unfortunately, if there’s any team and passing attack you don’t want to make someone face as the first true freshman to start at cornerback since the FDR administration, it’s Hawai’i.
This means the young secondary is going to have to grow up fast to give the Trojans a healthy shot at winning.
Although it all starts with USC’s outstanding defensive line putting pressure on an almost completely new offensive line for the Warriors, the X-factor for the Trojans will be the secondary. They need to keep Salas from getting too much space and wrap him up when he inevitably gets the ball.
USC sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley and his troops will put up numbers on offense against a very shaky Hawai’i defense. USC’s defensive line and linebackers will get pressure on Moniz and stop the run. But it’s up to the secondary to keep the game from becoming a shootout, as the Trojan offense isn’t exactly built for that type of scoring.
How the secondary performs tonight will indicate how the season will go for one of the most mysterious teams in the NCAA. If they can keep Moniz and Salas out of the end zone (for the most part) and in front of them, they will have the confidence going forward knowing that they can contain almost any passing attack.
But if the Warriors exploit the youthfulness of the Trojans in the defensive backfield, it could be a long night and an even longer season for USC.
Will Wile E. Coyote finally snatch the Road Runner? Or will this episode end like all the other ones, with Wile E. foiling his own diabolical plot and the Road Runner sprinting off into the distance, victorious again?

Although finishing one stroke shy of a national championship last season was a disappointing ending for the USC women’s golf team, the upcoming season is already off to a good start.
Looking forward · Senior Lizette Salas will lead the Women of Troy this season. Coming off a second-place finish at the NCAA championships last year, USC looks to do one better and win for the first time since 2008. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information Department  
Despite losing two All-Americans in Jennifer Song and Belen Mozo, the Women of Troy have been ranked No. 1 by the preseason Golf World coaches’ poll. The ranking is not unfamiliar territory to the team, which has been in and out of the No. 1 spot throughout the decade. USC won the NCAA championship in 2003 and 2008, and has finished in the top four in six of the last eight seasons.
The Women of Troy will be led by three-time All-American senior Lizette Salas and the lone remnant from the 2008 championship roster. Salas had four top-six finishes last year  and was the 2009 Pac-10 Player of the Year. Coming into this year, she needs only five more rounds in the 60s to tie Song for the USC women’s record for most rounds in the 60s (15).
Also returning are junior Inah Park and sophomore Cyna Rodriguez, both members of last season’s national runners-up roster.
The Women of Troy will also count on incoming transfer Lisa McCloskey, a junior from Pepperdine. McCloskey is a two-time All-American with three career collegiate victories that bring instant experience to the young team.
Joining McCloskey in the incoming class are freshmen Rachel Morris and Sophia Popov, both coming off impressive amateur wins this summer. Morris captured the Pacific Northwest Amateur title, and Popov won the International European Ladies Amateur Championship.
Probably the most improbable contributor to this year’s team will be freshman Pearl Jin, a 15-year-old, who at age 12 became the youngest qualifier in U.S. Women’s Amateur history. She finished the stroke play portion of the event in 18th place and advanced to the second-round of the match-play where she lost to another 12-year-old.
What might be her most amazing feat is the fact that she made a hole-in-one in 2006 on a 256-yard par 4. Jin skipped three grades to enter college this fall, becoming just the third female golfer in history to enter college at 15 years of age.
However, Jin’s status is uncertain for the upcoming season, as she suffers from osteochondritis dissecans, more commonly known as “Little League elbow,” which is a bone bruise. The only treatment is rest though no known cure exists.
This young team will be led by coach Andrea Gaston, entering her 15th year with the Women of Troy.
The team earned nine of 33 first-place votes in the poll, just enough to finish ahead of Pac-10 rival UCLA and defending national champion Purdue. Rounding out the top 10 are Alabama, Duke, Auburn, Arizona, Wake Forest, Virginia and Vanderbilt.
