Many anticipated that new USC President Carol Folt would clean house within the athletic department once she assumed office July 1. It took some time to come to fruition, but ultimately it happened. 
On Monday, Lynn Swann officially resigned from his position as athletic director months after an embarrassing admissions scandal. The football and men’s basketball teams also finished with losing records in the same season that the scandal took place.
“I am writing to share my sincere appreciation for Lynn Swann, who has decided to resign from his position as the Director of Athletics effective today,” wrote Folt in a message to the USC community. “Lynn has been a leader on and off the field at USC for nearly five decades, and he will forever be a valued member of the Trojan family.”
According to the Los Angeles Times, Folt’s, or, um, Swann’s decision had nothing to do with the scandal that resulted in the arrests of several coaches and senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel. It’s fair to take that information with a grain of salt. Swann’s tenure has been marred by scandals surrounding teams that have won (like water polo) and ineptitude from teams that have stayed clean (like football). It was never a sustainable combination for an administrator operating one of the most heavily scrutinized programs in the country. 
Many reporters, myself included, have written about the admissions scandal and the Tony Bland FBI investigation in length. So instead of looking back on Swann’s uneven tenure, I’m going to look forward at the type of person Folt should hire to bring USC’s athletic program back to national prominence — for the right reasons. 
First things first, she should avoid hiring someone with the “USC” tagline. The school’s past three athletic directors were all “USC guys” to their core. Mike Garrett, Pat Haden and Swann were all former Trojan football players who had limited administrative experience before becoming athletic directors. All were successful broadcasters and had some success in the business world. Accomplished men for sure, but so is Lee Corso. No one’s asking him to run an athletic department. 
It’s time for USC to stop hiring people who symbolize USC’s rich athletic past and hire someone who can propel the program into the future. The University needs to hire a true administrator who can seek out dynamic coaches while navigating the NCAA’s stringent amatuer rules. Bringing in someone with USC ties should be viewed as more of a negative than positive. That strategy simply hasn’t worked out in the past. 
Look at what head coach Clay Helton did in thinking outside the box and hiring offensive coordinator Graham Harrell. USC is traditionally a run-heavy team, with four Heisman Trophy-winning running backs in school history (five if you count Reggie Bush, which you should). 
Understandably, fans were concerned the Trojans would shift too far away from that tradition by hiring an Air-Raid offensive coordinator. So far, Helton’s bold decision has paid off: The offense looked unstoppable last weekend against Stanford, humming its way to 492 total yards. 
In finding someone to save the offense — and, by extension, his job — Helton didn’t hire someone from within or look to someone from the heralded Pete Carroll era to restore glory. He went against the grain, and it’s looking like it could be one of the best decisions of his tenure. 
Folt needs to make a similar move in order to save the athletic department. And the answer isn’t “hire Urban Meyer,” as many fans have speculated on the internet. While Meyer has had success at every school he’s coached at, his ability to oversee an athletic department should be questioned given his mishandling of the Zach Smith debacle at Ohio State. USC needs to avoid scandals going forward, and Meyer has been at the center of far too many over his career. Plus, it would create an ultra-uncomfortable situation for Helton in the middle of the season. He’s already on the hot seat. The last thing he needs is to be answering to his potential replacement. 
Folt would be wise to start her search by looking within the conference. Take Colorado’s Rick George and Washington State’s Patrick Chun. Both inherited athletic programs in dire need of upgrades and were able to raise the money to make it happen. Imagine what they could accomplish with the abundance of resources at USC. 
Whatever direction Folt decides to go, she made a smart and bold decision in moving on from the Swann era. Now it’s time to ignore history and make a groundbreaking hire that brings USC Athletics into a brand new era.

After their dominant 45-20 win over Pac-12 rival Stanford, the Trojans are preparing to continue their hot start and make a strong impression in their first road battle of the season against the Brigham Young Cougars Saturday.
With the news of former athletic director Lynn Swann’s resignation, former four-star recruit Devon Williams entering the transfer portal and speculation surrounding head coach Clay Helton’s job security, USC football seems unfazed and laser focused on game results as it hits the road.
Led by freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis, who threw for 377 yards and three touchdowns against the Cardinal, USC’s offense will look to keep up with other conference powerhouses through the first three weeks of the 2019 season, including No. 11 Utah, No. 15 Oregon and No. 23 Washington. Slovis, who led the Spirit of Troy after his illustrious debut, helped propel USC to No. 24 in the AP Top 25 Poll.
“The fast pace, the tempo and the simplicity just allows our guys to play fast,” Slovis said of the Air Raid offense led by offensive coordinator Graham Harrell. “[The wide receivers] don’t have to think too much, they kinda just play naturally.”
Brigham Young is currently 1-1 on the season and coming off a win in double overtime over the Tennessee Volunteers. Sophomore quarterback Zach Wilson’s 64-yard pass to senior receiver Micah Simon helped set up a game-tying field goal with one second left in regulation. BYU’s comeback made national headlines as Tennessee started its season 0-2 for the first time since 1988.
“There were some things that were surprising to us, but I’m really pleased with how our coaches responded with adjusting some of the things that we did on both sides of the ball,” BYU head coach Kalani Sitake said. “We made some improvements from Week 1 to Week 2, but I’d like to see it continue.”
USC and BYU have only faced off twice in history — during the 2003 and 2004 seasons — with the Trojans coming out victorious in both games. During those two seasons, USC went on to become national champions.
BYU’s only national championship was in 1984 when the Cougars beat the Michigan Wolverines in the Holiday Bowl under legendary head coach LaVell Edwards, whom Sitake played under as a fullback from 1998 to 2000. However, both programs are looking toward the future: USC is placing a heavy emphasis on defense this week.
“[The defense] just looks fresher when they come off the field,” defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said. “It’s allowing us to play more guys, which I’m really happy about so far.”
Redshirt senior linebacker John Houston and sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga lead USC with 18 tackles, while senior defensive lineman Christian Rector and freshman defensive end Drake Jackson lead the Trojans’ pass rush. USC only has two interceptions on the year, one each for redshirt sophomore safety Isaiah Pola-Mao and redshirt sophomore cornerback Greg Johnson, but players such as sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin and freshman cornerback Chris Steele will look to add to the team’s total this week.
Collectively, the USC defense’s biggest challenge will be trying to get past BYU junior offensive lineman and Notre Dame transfer Tristen Hoge, while the offensive line, led by junior tackle Austin Jackson and redshirt sophomore guard Alijah Vera-Tucker, will look to fend off BYU sophomore defensive end Alden Tofa.
USC’s matchup at BYU is set to kick off live on ABC at 12:30 p.m.

Randolph Hall, vice president of research, will step down from his position at the end of the year, Interim Provost Elizabeth Graddy announced Tuesday
“USC has grown into a top-tier research university, and Dr. Hall’s leadership has been critical to this evolution,” Graddy wrote in an email to University faculty and staff.
Hall told the Daily Trojan that his decision to leave the University came after some personal reflection — and after working at the school for 14 years. 
“[I’ve] come to realize that what I care most about is impact on the innovation, universities broadly,” Hall said. “And, particularly how universities can bring together innovation across three main elements, the education, research and clinical research clinical programs that universities have and how they might be integrated.”
Part of Hall’s  job includes overseeing over $800 million dollars in research funds at the University. Hall held the position of assistant dean for research at the Viterbi School of Engineering for four years.
Hall said he is most proud of launching the Washington, D.C. Office of Research Advancement which finds funding in the nation’s capital for research projects promoting social change. He also contributed to the Total Access for Research Administration, a system that helps manage research awards, proposals, laboratories and overall protocols.
“A big part of what I did was look at how universities can adapt to digital technology and our practices, practices research in particular,” Hall said. “So, that partly was writing policies to enable and reward innovation, partly creating services that enable collaboration.”
After leaving, Hall hopes to visit other universities and stakeholders. He hopes to collect information about ranking universities, their accreditation, their scientific procedures, funding and leadership. Hall plans on later writing a book about universities and innovation with this knowledge.
According to a University spokesperson, an advisory search committee with the task of finding a new vice president of research will be launched soon. Incoming Provost Chip Zukosi will be involved in the committee.
“Across our university’s history, our best leaders have worked for the good of our campus community and for the public at large, and Dr. Hall has embodied this spirit of generosity for the entirety of his service,” Graddy wrote in the email. “Through informed risk-taking, a spirit of collaboration, and a commitment to positive, lasting impact, Dr. Hall has demonstrated how to achieve excellence in research.”

Nearly 3,000 American flags flanked the pathway at the entrance of USC Village Wednesday in memory of the lives lost in the Sept. 11 terror attacks in 2001. The project was organized by the USC chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, a national conservative political organization.
The memorial was part of the 9/11: Never Forget Project, an initiative started by the national foundation in 2003 when members “discovered that most college campuses were either completely ignoring the anniversary or holding a politically correct event instead,” according to its website. Wednesday’s event was the first to take place on USC’s campus, although YAF chapters at other universities have participated in the past. 
The Sept. 11 attacks were the deadliest terror attacks in United States history. Nineteen members of the Islamic extremist group al-Qaeda hijacked four planes and ultimately killed 2,977 people in three different states. 
Lawmakers recently extended the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund through 2090, ensuring that billions of dollars will go toward the medical treatment and monetary compensation of thousands of people who have been impacted by that fateful day.  
YAF Activities Chair Kailee Evans stressed that although YAF identifies as a conservative group, members tried to make the event “as apolitical as possible.” 
A table manned by students throughout the day displayed pins that read “9/11: Never Forget” and “YAF Believes in America,” in addition to pocket-sized copies of the U.S. Constitution. Unlike other YAF events, members said they decided not to include their more political souvenirs, such as stickers that support the Second Amendment. 
“I don’t want to polarize anyone and make them not feel included in this event because they don’t necessarily agree with those political standpoints,” said Evans, a junior majoring in business administration. 
Jay Goldstuck, a junior majoring in film production, said she chose not to interact with the memorial because of her disagreement with previous YAF activities, including an event that the group hosted featuring conservative commentator Ben Shapiro last October.  
While Goldstuck, an international student from South Africa, said she understood the importance of memorializing the lives lost in 9/11, she said the event could only be viewed as apolitical “in a bubble.” 
The Sept. 11 attacks prompted a military campaign known as the War on Terror, which has led to over 480,000 deaths in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to a 2018 study from Brown University. Hate crimes against Muslim people surged by 1,600% in the year following the attacks, according to FBI data. 
“Each flag represented someone who was killed,” Goldstuck said. “But it was kind of an attempt to group them all as Americans and not as … having identities beyond being American, which is how the right turns the discourse about 9/11 to be an Islamophobic conversation.”
Members spoke about the memorial’s importance, especially because a growing number of students have little to no memories of the event. Those born on Sept. 12, 2001, will turn 18 Thursday, making them the first adults to be born after the attacks took place. 
YAF Chairman Maxwell Brandon said that last year’s anniversary was the first during which YAF was an official campus organization, but members weren’t able to reserve a lawn for the display. This year, he said, YAF members were organized and secured a spot at USC Village, although he said he would have preferred a more central location like Alumni Park.
Brandon, a senior majoring in accounting and business administration, said YAF members purchased the flags for around $400 using a discount provided by the national organization.
Although USC chapter members stressed that the project was meant to be bipartisan, the national foundation urges students to participate in the project in an online step-by-step guide that reads, “Don’t let the Left appropriate this day to promote their politically correct, socialist agenda” and suggests that students invite a conservative speaker to campus in connection with the project.  
Evans said she would have considered co-organizing the event with a more liberal campus organization but that doing so would have complicated the terms under which Young America’s Foundation would have been able to sponsor the campus event. 
YAF is hosting a discussion Thursday night at the Von KleinSmid Center with two former FBI agents, Jason Weiss and Jim Watkins, as a follow-up to Wednesday’s memorial. YAF Recruitment Chair Justin Weiss said his father, who is one of the speakers, was involved in forensic analysis following the 9/11 attacks and plans to speak about his experience.

The ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives at USC, the world’s largest collection of LGBTQ materials in the world, will complete its archive of historical documents by November. ONE Archives, which is located on West Adams Boulevard, is the oldest existing LGBTQ organization in the United States and houses over two million items, including texts and art from the 1900s.
Michael Gorse, assistant director of the LGBT Resource Center, said that digitizing the material will uphold the archives’ mission to make historical resources more accessible while promoting awareness of LGBTQ history. The project is currently in its final stages of digitization.
“I think often times throughout history, LGBT history even, in history of marginalized communities [there] has often been attempts to be erased or forgotten intentionally by folks who are anti-us,” Gorse said. “Before [digitizing] … students would still have to go in person to see it, so there’s a physical barrier … This allows increased access to these materials,  expand our reach of education and the preservation of knowledge, and in case something ever happens to the physical documents … to have another format.”
The digitization of the collection, entitled “Out Front: 60 Years of LGBTQ Political Graphics at the ONE Archives,” began in 2017 after the ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives and the USC Digital Library realized there was a large collection of posters and political memorabilia that has been mostly uncatalogued for many years. 
Gorse said that as a result, most people haven’t been able to see the archives. The digitization project provides easier access to the graphics for documentaries, books, websites and historical accounts.
Emily Johnson, a sophomore majoring in political science and French, said she visited the archives during her first semester at USC as part of an outing during Welcome Week with a group of students led by writing lecturer Christina Belcher. She hopes that digitizing the archives will help more people see them and learn about their history.
“I don’t think a lot of people know that it exists or realize what’s there,” Johnson said. “It seems like there’s not a lot of outreach to students about the fact that it exists, so I think [digitizing] some of the content or at least having a web page for people to search … would be very helpful.”
If they can, Johnson said people should still visit the archives in person to see and learn about their history. 
The collection is slated to include handmade signs from public demonstrations at the White House during the 1960s; picket signs from Act Up, a vocal group from the ‘80s that tried to raise awareness for AIDS; photographs from the Annual Reminders protests of 1965; and iconic posters from the Gay Liberation from the 1970s. All of these early protests focused on equality, inclusion and equal protections under the law. 
The archives include a poster advertising a “Gay-In” at Griffith Park with the description “come together … reach out and join hands with your brothers and sisters.” Another sign that reads “Stop Police Brutality and Entrapment of Homosexuals!”
The digitization started when USC Libraries received a grant from the Council on Library and International Relations, an independent nonprofit that collaborates with educational institutions to enhance research and learning, called Digitizing Hidden Collections. Since 2015, the grant has given about $4 million to institutions known for their research, teaching and learning environments each year.
ONE Archives librarian Loni Shibuyama said the initiative was challenging because of organizational barriers that come with archiving old material.
“The challenges are that these materials are difficult to organize and difficult to handle. Because they were oversized items,” Shibuyama said. “You kind of have to go through and organize it, catalog it individually and also digitizing it is difficult too. I’m proud that it will soon be available to more and more people who can see the long history and diversity within the collection.”

The California State Senate unanimously passed Senate Bill 206 Wednesday, which would make collegiate athletes eligible for compensation from the use of their name, image or likeness. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has 30 days to sign the bill or veto it.
Under the bill, student-athletes would also be able to hire agents while maintaining eligibility at the college level.
The California Senate has received backlash from the NCAA, which stated in a letter to Newsom prior to the bill’s passing that it would “erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletics.”
The NCAA has argued that the bill would give California schools an unfair advantage recruiting because athletes would be drawn to schools where they could potentially profit. The NCAA threatened that if SB206 is signed into law, the organization would prohibit 58 California collegiate programs from participating in NCAA competition.
This would mean that some of the NCAA’s top athletic programs — including USC, Stanford, UCLA and Cal — would be barred from competing.
After reaching out, the University gave the Daily Trojan the same statement it did when the bill was first introduced in February by the California government.
“USC opposes SB206 because the proposed California law would encourage student-athletes to violate NCAA bylaws relating to amateurism and receiving outside compensation,” the statement read.
The University also cited the warning from the NCAA as support for its decision.
“Because the proposed state law conflicts with NCAA bylaws, students would become athletically ineligible, and athletic programs and athletic departments would be put at risk,” the University wrote. “When a single student-athlete engages in any activity that violates NCAA rules, the entire team and program could be negatively impacted by NCAA sanctions.”
Myra “Miki” Turner, an assistant professor of professional practice at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, said she wants college athletes to be compensated but is worried about how the change will affect them.
“When you start to make money off your likeness and image, you can really no longer be considered an amateur athlete,” Turner said.
Turner also said that if the California schools are banned from competing in the NCAA, athletes might be incentivized to jump from high school to the pros, missing out on the social and cultural opportunities of college.
“I hope it doesn’t come to that,” Turner said. “I hope that there is some middle ground somewhere that the athletes can be compensated and still maintain their status to play in the NCAA.”
The bill, which was approved by a unanimous 72-0 vote in the state Senate, will go into effect Jan. 1, 2023 if signed.

Imagine this: A parent is helping their child, an incoming freshman, move into their dorm during Welcome Week. Overwhelmed by everything involved with moving in, all they want to do is make the transition easier. Soapy Joe’s, a laundry service catered to students, has a table advertising its service set up outside the dorms. In the uncertainty of the moment, they sign their child up. It will just be one less thing to worry about, they tell themselves. 
Signing up for the laundry service is completely well-intentioned and seems like a good idea at the time, but parents and students don’t realize the consequences of relying on a student laundry provider in a collegiate setting. 
By missing the opportunity to learn basic skills before graduating, the detrimental effects of depending on a company like Soapy Joe’s are far-reaching. 
Soapy Joe’s Laundry Service is a “pick up and delivery full garment care service for students” in which all “loads are professionally washed” within a 24-hour turnaround time. Self-described as “USC’s most trusted name in laundry since 2005,” the company advertises three primary reasons for why students should utilize the amenity.
The first reason explains how the service allows students to “catch up on studies” and “focus on what’s important in life.” Many people view college solely as a means to an end — the required step to reach an academic or career goal. What many fail to realize is that college is more than classes. For most, college is the first time students live independently. And this includes doing their laundry for the first time. 
Living on a college campus is the ideal place to transition from childhood to adulthood, surrounded by students experiencing the same changes, challenges and adjustments. Nick Lander, associate director of residence life at Kansas State University, believes in the value of becoming self-sufficient in a college atmosphere. On students doing their own laundry for the first time, Lander believes that the “collaborative environment, where there’s support and people” to share those experiences with has a “very positive impact.”
It is important to note that in some cases, it is the parent signing the student up for the laundry service to make themselves feel better about their child moving away for the first time, and the student does not have any say. Parents should be cautioned against signing their student up because of its apparent impact on their development and collegiate experience, as described by Lander. 
The second benefit Soapy Joe’s advertises on its website is how it gives students time to “improve [their] well being.” The website continues to explain how “balance is the key to a successful life.” However, this rationale does not apply because if someone is leading a balanced life — managing their studies, extracurriculars and personal well-being — they should not have to rely on a student laundry service as a crutch.
According to a study in the Sage Journal analyzing the impact of time management on undergraduate engineering students’ academic performance, those with better time management behaviors have a higher GPA. Through establishing a definitive link between time management and GPA, the results shed light upon an obstacle to academic success and open up the conversation to ways to improve a student’s time management skills. However, if a student is not even responsible for their own laundry, how can they be expected to improve upon their time management skills in the first place? 
The third and final reason to subscribe to Soapy Joe’s service, is how it offers students the opportunity to “have fun and live weekends to the fullest.” First off, this explanation gives the impression that doing laundry — the reality for the vast majority of the world — prevents people from “having fun,” which isn’t true. More importantly, if students are out “having fun” every weekend, how will they be prepared after they leave college to embark on their career? Post-college life isn’t always just fun.
Soapy Joe’s is doing a disservice to USC students by readily supplying them with a loophole to escape independence. There are many benefits of doing laundry, from learning how to manage time and becoming self-sufficient to meeting new people in the laundry room and being resourceful — and students should not miss out on any of it. College is the time to transition alongside peers, and if students are incapable of doing their own laundry, it is unreasonable to expect them to be self-sufficient after leaving the University. 
Taking steps to fully integrate into the residential experiences of living on a college campus — which includes doing laundry — allows students to truly maximize collegiate life,  preparing students for what’s ahead.

Recently, Netflix placed billboards featuring its upcoming show “The Politician” around the USC campus. Set against a loud shade of pink stands the tasteful quote, “I bought their way in, too.” Actress Gwyneth Paltrow and her two fictional sons stand simultaneously smug and 
self-righteous, the men decked out in USC’s signature cardinal and gold, their collars turned up at an angle indicative of absurd privilege. 
This move by Netflix can only be construed as a well-planned publicity campaign. Though the show — which satirizes privilege and power and touches on the particularly relevant college admissions scandal — was filmed prior to the outbreak of the investigations, the location and not-so-subtle choice of colors makes the advertisement’s intent obvious. 
Despite being a cheap shot at such a highly publicized wound, the accusation is accurate, unsurprising and in some ways completely warranted. 
This has been a half year of exposure and retribution for USC and its fellow upper-crust universities. Since early March, federal prosecutors have continued to unroll a seemingly endless string of bribery and fraud charges against parents and university officials alike. The details follow a now-tired pattern: privileged parent pays off college admissions consultant William Singer and various members of administration in order to ensure the student’s college acceptance.
It would be decidedly best to embrace this comedic exposure so generously gifted by Netflix and allow the light of day to burn away remaining suspicions surrounding USC’s admissions process. With the recent changes in the administration and appointment of President Carol Folt, a new age of genuine prosperity and growth lies within reach. However, the window for this opportunity is quickly dwindling. If kept under wraps for too long, it will only become infected and fester, leaving a legacy of corruption, downfall and missed opportunities. 
The ability to stay relevant and on-trend is essential for survival — and Netflix is doing just that. The $157.3-billion company functions as a predator in this capitalistic food chain. Ironically, the same can be said of the accused USC parents and the educational institution itself. 
Months of scandal and investigation have weakened USC, leaving the University as easy prey for a power-hungry enterprise such as Netflix. With the billboard attacks, the streaming company has gone straight for those existing vulnerabilities, gorging itself on USC’s still-bleeding reputation. 
The University needs to take advantage of this opportunity and assume an active role in rebuilding its soiled reputation. Allowing the “The Politician” publicity to work for both sides would be enough to start some change. In this age of liability, there is no place for empty posturing. Silence may seem to be the best answer, but in reality, it only communicates haughtiness — something that does not benefit a place casually known as the “University of Spoiled Children.” By using Netflix’s billboards for its own rebranding, USC can reestablish some control over its public image without seeming like a whining baby choking on its silver spoon.

Greedley Harris III attended his first USC football game only days ago, sporting his custom cardinal and gold Nikes that he designed three years back. 
“I’ve always had an affinity for USC,” said Harris, the newly appointed director of the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs.
Harris, who previously served as the interim director for African Student Programs at UC Riverside, arrived at USC only three months ago. But despite the short amount of time he’s been at the University, Harris has already implemented a number of changes at CBCSA.
Harris replaced previous director Rosalind Conerly, who took a job as the director of Black Community Service Centers at Stanford University.
Since his arrival, Harris reworked the physical layout of the CBCSA office. In an effort  to make the center seem more welcoming to students, Harris proposed moving the student lounge to the back of the room and placing the front desk and student workers near the door — the room’s layout had previously been reversed, with the front desk located at the back and couches directly in front of the door. Though a seemingly small change, Harris hopes this will allow for students to be greeted and assisted upon their arrival.
“In my mind, that’s kind of intimidating,” Harris said of the old layout. “We just changed our physical space because we want our front desk staff and our student staff, that are amazing, to catch those [new] folks and be that first point of contact.” 
However, Harris hopes to create more changes to CBCSA than simply modifying the space. He has four overarching goals this school year: strengthening the inner workings of CBCSA, ushering new students into the center, creating relationships with other USC departments and formalizing aspects of CBCSA processing.
He also hopes to welcome new students to CBCSA. Whether a freshman or transfer student, Harris wants the community to know about the space and resources the organization has to offer.
“We ran a little bit of data and about 80% of students [that] come into the space are junior, senior [or] graduate [students], and that’s great. But, we want our first year students to know about this space,” Harris said. “The earlier they know about it the earlier they get connected to resources and the earlier they get connected and interjected into the community.”
Harris, who describes himself as a “relational” person, wants to improve the relationship between CBCSA and USC organizations. He seeks to collaborate with departments, organizations and clubs like the Trojan Food Pantry and other cultural centers.
Harris also hopes to tackle one of the main issues he believes affects Black students on campus: representation. 
According to Harris, retention of both staff and student resources plays a key role in bringing more Black students, staff and faculty to USC. According to University statistics, 5.6% of students identified as Black/African American during the Fall 2018 semester. While staffing isn’t necessarily in Harris’ job description, it’s a task he still feels the need to address.
“The Black faculty and staff are the role models, they are the mentors, they are the resources to our Black students,” Harris said. “If our Black faculty and staff are constantly cycling in and out … there’s not a lot of stability.”
Harris believes that the issue of Black faculty retention and student representation is an institutional issue and acknowledges that CBCSA cannot fix this issue alone. 
“That’s something that we need to … do a better job as an institution …  and again, this office can help with that. But you know, they’ll need to be institutional support for that as well,” Harris said. “We’re not recruiting Black faculty staff, but retaining them.”
Working with student leaders is also crucial to Harris’ vision for CBCSA. Harris, who has a background in working with Black student leaders and organizations, has already began monthly meetings with USC’s Black Student Assembly.
“We’re even thinking about creating orientations for our Black student organizations out of this office to give some more support — that’s a crucial component,” Harris said.
Jasmine Blevins, the BSA programming chair, had the opportunity to work directly with Greedley in furthering developing the Somerville Floor, CBCSA’s Black residential community floor in Fluor Tower. Blevins is also a resident assistant for Somerville Floor.
“He’s very knowledgeable on … how to bring people together, especially the incoming class because freshman year, as a lot of us know, can be an adventure,” Blevins said. “With Greedley’s help and all his guidance that he’s made … we’re going to be making a lot of great strides in terms of turning Somerville into a greater space.”
Blevins hopes to see Harris bring unity within CBCSA for both undergraduate and graduate students. She believes Harris’ and CBCSA’s new use of Dinka symbols throughout the center is a first step in accomplishing that sense of unity.
“They’re West African symbols that symbolize different traits, leadership traits,” Blevins said. “He’s making sure that every initiative that they put forward, … that they collaborate with another cultural floor or any other organization on campus has something to do with those traits … and building some type of trait in us, us as students and putting that in the forefront of everything that we do.”
Jaya Hinton, a new student worker at CBCSA, believes Harris’ previous work at other institutions will allow him to tackle USC’s problems in a new manner.
“There was a lot of turnover within the University as a whole last year but it’s always nice to get, you know, a fresh face, someone who’s … always willing to go a little bit more above and beyond when they first start because it’s all their new initiatives,” Hinton said. “It’s what they did with them beforehand and it’s without kind of being jaded from whatever hasn’t worked at University beforehand.”
Most importantly, Harris wants to continue contributing to CBCSA’s lasting legacy.
“This particular department been around since 1977. So, it’s older than some of the colleges here,” Harris said. “I want it to be seen as an important part of Trojan history, [an] important institution, [an] important resource for Trojans, Black Trojans, but also a part of Trojan history.”

The Undergraduate Student Government released a public statement Tuesday reaffirming its commitment to campus mental health following the deaths of two students last week. 
The statement, authored by Speaker Emily Donahue and Sen. Benjamin Shiff and sponsored by 10 USG senators, said the Senate will provide a record of mental health initiatives it’s pursuing by Oct. 15. 
“We are going to be providing a list of steps we’ve taken and initiatives, even if they’ve fallen on deaf ears with administrators,” Donahue told the Daily Trojan. “We are just trying to be more transparent as a Senate.”
The statement also emphasized a need for diverse and substantive mental health services for the USC community. 
“Students from all backgrounds and experiences deserve accessible mental health resources that accommodate their needs,” the statement said. “We vow this commitment will be met with concrete actions … Senators are committing to working on and prioritizing initiatives that address this need on our campus and in our community.”
The Senate released the statement in hopes of getting feedback from the student body on how to improve mental health resources at USC. 
 Donahue said she hopes USG initiatives will collaborate with the Engemann Student Health Center on marketing initiatives to educate students on the warning signs of suicide and the current mental health programs available to the campus community. 
Student Health has also unveiled plans to dedicate the renovated fifth floor of the health center to mental health resources. The floor is set to open in November. Donahue said she wishes to hold the health center accountable for any promises of new initiatives and make sure there are an adequate number of counselors for students.
 USG has worked on mental health initiatives in recent years, including OT 299, “THRIVE: Foundations of Well-Being,” a course piloted last year that teaches students wellness strategies, including stress management techniques and positive psychology. The course was designed in part by former USG Vice President Blake Ackerman along with other USG members and USC professors. 
Students dealing with mental health concerns can walk in to USC Student Health centers or contact the 24/7 phone line  (213) 740-9355 for professional assistance. Faculty and staff members can reach out to the Center for Work and Family Life at (213) 821-0800. Students, faculty and staff members concerned about a fellow Trojan can notify Campus Support and Intervention by calling (213) 821-4710.

Music has always played a major role in Matt Richards’ life — he’s been playing saxophone and woodwinds since he was 7, and the Thornton School of Music became the ideal place for him to develop his passion professionally.
“Thornton was definitely the place to go,” said the senior majoring in jazz studies (saxophone performance).
Thornton has become a catalyst for his music. Thanks to USC, he plays in two different ensembles.
“It’s really been about finding who I can make the best relationships with musically and personally, too,” he said.
But his music isn’t limited to USC. The saxophonist recently finished a show with Grammy Award-winning jazz ensemble The Yellowjackets. 
“I played a show with them in Napa Valley College,” Richards said. “That was an incredible experience for sure. The leader of that group is the chair of the Jazz Studies department. I studied with him my freshman year privately.”
Along with making connections outside of the school, Richards has also helped start a rock/hip-hop band called Cab Ellis — and has even performed at the legendary concert venue, the Troubadour. With Cab Ellis, he plays both clarinet and sax and also gets to write much of the music. 
Along with his musical endeavors, Richards still has to manage classes — and it takes hard work and late nights. 
“Something I’ve learned [to do] is looking ahead because a lot of my classes have to do with writing music and composing music, which is not a quick endeavor,” Richards said. “It really takes time to write what you have in your head.”
A music industry minor, Richards is not only preparing for a successful artistic career, but also for confronting difficult real-world scenarios — like reading and understanding contracts — on the path to success.
“With Cab Ellis, we are releasing our first song in late September, so knowing exactly where the money comes, knowing exactly what kind of deals we can make to get the song out there and really getting the hard numbers of where the money is going is helpful,” he said. “If you’re good at the business side, it allows you to be more creative because you’re able to invest in yourself.”
Richards is determined to make music his full-time occupation after leaving USC.
“[I want] to have the means to be able to do what I’m doing now,” Richards said. “In college, you have some free time to be able to rehearse until 2 a.m. on a Tuesday. My main goal is for the business to be in music, to be able to go into the studio with Cab Ellis and be creative for the whole day.”
Richards can be heard on David Ayscue’s record “Southwood Waltz” on Spotify.  Cab Ellis’ single, “Suburbia,” will be out later this month on Spotify.

Under the vibrant orange hue of fluorescent lights, thousands have gathered, arms outstretched toward a new temple offering a singular form of solace: chicken. 
For years, it has been neglected, cast in the shadow under other chicken-serving giants. But now, it had emerged, blinking in the morning sun … a chance — at long last — in the spotlight. 
Have you heard about the Popeye’s Chicken Sandwich?
A humble creation, with no bells and whistles: Popeye’s chicken, brioche bun, mayonnaise, pickles. It came unadorned, unabashed and inexpensive, a natural extension of the Popeye’s oeuvre, a simplistic-yet-satisfying product. After years of relative silence, Popeye’s burst back into the public eye with a media fireball that is only growing.
News of Popeye’s poultry product spread quickly, and instead of traditional advertising, it was a chorus of thousands of people on Twitter that propelled the Popeye’s chicken sandwich into a national sensation.
 What started as a few stray tweets transformed into a full-blown chicken sandwich panic: Over the course of a few weeks from Aug. 12 to 27, heated fast food debates, hour-long drive-thru lines and countless memes spawned from the Popeye’s sandwich.
The Popeye’s chicken sandwich has gone viral. 
But, another product had already gone before it.
Slinking in the shadows of early 2019, glinting from the curled hand of that girl at that one party, was an alcoholic beverage so neutral, so affable, so harmless that it was destined to be a sensation. A natural response to the rejection of sugary sodas and acceptance of lighter carbonated beverages, young America was so willing to embrace a healthier alternative to binge-drinking that White Claw eased its way to the top of every 23-year-old’s grocery list. 
A drink lighter than wine, but heavier than beer, with cleaner marketing and a smoother taste: In many ways, White Claw embodies the desire to improve our unhealthy behaviors without sacrificing them. The company experienced steady growth over the course of three years until this summer, when social media again turned this product into a phenomenon.
Like the similarly marketed “healthier for you than the real thing but not really” vape Juul, White Claw cultivated itself within a community of fraternity brothers and overconfident college students, resulting in a prompt tsunami of memes, viral videos and inside jokes about the product. White Claw spread by word of mouth, and hard seltzer became the drink of the summer. 
While other brands like Henry’s, Truly Hard Seltzer or even the forsaken 14% ABV Four Loko Seltzer also enjoy the online-driven success of spiked seltzer, White Claw reigns supreme. 
Simply put, White Claw has gone viral.
Virality, while a source of insurmountable power and fame, is a difficult-to-handle weapon.
Like Icarus, both Popeye’s and White Claw have flown too close to the sun. 
Slammed with an impossibly high demand for the chicken sandwich, Popeye’s removed it from the menu Aug. 27, sparking national outrage. Real, honest tears were shed over the temporary death of the Popeye’s sandwich. Those late to the trend were left to mourn over the thought of what could have been.
The Popeye’s chicken sandwich will return to the menu once the chain is better equipped to handle the demand, and with it, the most successful business period Popeye’s has ever had.
Similarly, White Claw has been struggling with its newfound fame, unable to physically produce enough to match the demand. The United States is entering a White Claw shortage (the fraternity brother Great Depression). The refrigerated aisle of beer across supermarket chains now contains an empty, White-Claw shaped gash in its seltzer section.
Despite their temporary setbacks, White Claw and Popeye’s are both experiencing a moment of mainstream popularity carried by social media — through memes, reviews and word of mouth, these products have inadvertently become a part of internet culture. While far from being the first examples of social media bolstering a dormant brand, the online frenzy around White Claw and Popeye’s this summer has been exceptionally effective. 
It’s clear that brands and companies are aware of the power of social media: Look to Twitter accounts for brands like Wendy’s, SunnyD and Denny’s, infused with millennial and Gen-Z humor while still promoting new products. While this is a brilliant way of maintaining relevance in the public eye, the viral success of Popeye’s and White Claw isn’t the same case: It never felt intentional. Jokes came from the consumers, not from the marketers. 
As the ravenous crowds surrounding Popeye’s wean off, and White Claw secures a quicker method of production, it will be interesting to see how brands interpret the series of events that transformed these products into cultural icons. Will brands try to start their own memes? Will they hire companies to plant the joke deep into Twitter culture? Is nothing sacred?
The explosive success of the Popeye’s chicken sandwich and White Claw hard seltzer indicates that virality is not just for people but also for brands — a double-edged sword, so long as companies are equipped to handle the fame.
