With an 8-0 record, the Women of Troy have set a new program record for number of consecutive games won and the Trojans’ 17-4 victory against Dartmouth on Wednesday marked the team’s fifth double-digit win.
Next up, the Trojans take on Oregon at McAlister Field on Sunday afternoon.
With a No. 8 ranking, the team is looking to continue to assert their dominance with each game presenting a new opportunity to prove themselves. 
“It’s a big mission of our team this year to not just show that we can win games but show that we can dominate games for a full 60 minutes,” junior attacker Michaela Michael said. “Last year we had a hard time doing that. We would come away with wins but they would be a lot closer than we wanted them to be.” 
Michael has been a crucial member of the Trojan offense notching her 20th career hat trick against Dartmouth, scoring four goals and recording three assists. The offense has been a force to be reckoned with as the team has outscored their opponents 129-37 at this point in the season, averaging 11.5 goals per game. 
“Offensively right now we have a number of different people who are being threats which is really great,” head coach Lindsay Munday said. “If someone isn’t having their best game, we have other people that can step up and really take charge and I think that’s been a great thing for our offense right now.” 
In addition to a powerful offense, the Women of Troy can attribute their success to a solid defense, holding their opponents to under ten goals in seven out of their eight games.
“The defense is playing phenomenal,” Munday said. “We’re really playing as a unit. They’ve been playing together now for three and four years so they communicate really well back there, they’re on the same page.” 
However, even when the Trojans are winning by double digits, the girls look to focus on their goals and executing what they set out to do. 
“In lacrosse, you can score goals really quickly so I don’t think we’re ever really comfortable with a lead,” Munday said. “Really we’re just trying to focus on us and make sure that no matter what the score is — whether we are up by 10 or down by 10 — that we are committing to the things that we want to do as a program so the score really doesn’t matter. We are always just trying to make sure that we are disciplined, focused and that we’re executing.” 
Against Oregon, the Trojans are 2-2, winning 13-11 in their last encounter in April 2015. With a current 6-3 record, the Ducks boast a powerful offense of their own featuring Bella Pyne, who has scored 18 goals this season and national assist leader Cambi Cukar, who has notched 30 assists. 
“Oregon is a great team, they are very physical,” Munday said. “They can score goals really quickly. We found that out last year.”
Despite their success thus far in the season, the Trojans are never complacent and look to improve each time that they step out on the field. 
“We definitely need to continue to get better,” Munday said. “That’s really been our motto from day one of this program. Every single day, we need to continue to get better both individually and collectively as well, so that motto has really never changed for us no matter how the season is going.”

Written by Andrew Bovell and brought to life by the Aeneid Theatre Company, When the Rain Stops Falling is the tale of a disillusioned family that undergoes several generations of death, pain and depravity. This nonlinear narrative starts in England and later changes setting to Australia over a timeframe of roughly 60-70 minutes. Although that can occasionally lead to confusion, once things start to click, the show becomes very gripping.
The main players in this ensemble cast are lovers Gabriel Law and Gabrielle York, their illegitimate son who is also named Gabriel, his son Andrew York, Gabriel Law’s parents (Elizabeth and Henry) and Gabrielle’s husband Joe Ryan. It’s a complicated family tree, and as a result much of the first act is dedicated to establishing the relationships between all of the characters. This means that the show starts off kind of slow and leans a little too heavily on exposition at first, but by the second act once everything gets set up Bovell takes the opportunity to shock the audience by taking his characters to extremely dark, morbid and occasionally disturbing places.
This sense of foreboding is conveyed well by the play’s direction. Director Katharine Stocker does a very good job getting the most of her actors, all of whom turn in very believable performances. The hunkered down Elizabeth Law, who transforms before the audience’s very eyes from a vibrant young women to a broken, bitter old lady is a particularly noteworthy character. While the accents for the most part are done very well, the Australian accents weren’t always as clear as the English ones.
It’s the relationships between the characters, however, that makes this story so compelling. Gabriel Law’s tenuous relationship with his mother, Elizabeth’s slowly crumbling marriage with Henry and Gabrielle’s unloving marriage to Joe are all examples of intriguing storylines that intersect in extremely engaging ways. There aren’t any plot points that feel like filler.
The play flows effortlessly between scenes. There are very few transitions where the lights simply fade to black. Characters who aren’t participating in the current scene are often already on stage preparing for when the spotlight starts to shine on them, and while this is occasionally bizarrely abstract and jarring, for the most part it comes of naturally.
The set, lighting and sound design are also well done in this play. The stage accommodates a myriad of different settings, most of which are inside due to the fact that in every scene, no matter what year it is, it is almost constantly raining outside. The lighting helps accentuate this with a very deliberate use of blues, and the sound design of the omnipresent rain in the background is noticeable without being overwhelming.
The costume design also lends itself well to the overall dourness of the play. Most of the characters are dressed very plainly with a lot of beige, whites and pale yellows. Although the costumes don’t always do a great job conveying the time period (characters that are living in 2020 are dressed as if they were living in 1920), overall the play is methodically designed with a great attention to detail.
When the Rain Stops Falling is an investment. It takes some effort to wrap your head around what exactly is going on for most of the first act and some things that become hugely important and meaningful later in the play come off as superfluous and confusing at first. However, when this show hits its peak in the second act it’s deeply fascinating, and this foreboding, pseudo-apocalyptic narrative was well worth watching.
