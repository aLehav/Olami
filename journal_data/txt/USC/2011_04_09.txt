Spring fever? No worries, USC – there are plenty of hot trailers to whet your cinematic appetite for upcoming movies.
Hangover II

That’s right, folks – the highly anticipated sequel to the raunchy-buddy-roofie comedy hits theaters May 26 and puts Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha and Ken Jeong in exotic Thailand. Directed by Todd Phillips, who knows what kinds of shenanigans the wolfpack will endure?
Watch the trailer here.
Crazy Stupid Love 
Take a very shirtless Ryan Gosling, a moping Steve Carell and Hollywood’s two favorite redheads, Emma Stone and Julianne Moore, and you’ve got a recipe for a promising romantic comedy hitting theaters July 29. Sure, Carell’s past forays onto screen may have been mixed (the forgettable Date Night, the adorable Despicable Me), but the memorable veteran Moore (The Kids are All Right) and the adorable newcomer Stone (Easy A) should make this ensemble more than just crazy stupid.

Hesher
The ubiquitous Natalie Portman forays into producing with this ahem, interesting, looking indie that stars both herself and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It’ll at least be a delight to hipsters everywhere. This strange flick hits theaters May 13.
Watch the trailer here.
Everything Must Go
Poor Will Ferrell. He just seems to play the most hapless of losers. This serious Ferrell joint employs a new motif, though: He’s got an adorable little guy to help him sell his stuff after his wife leaves him and he gets laid off. This Stranger Than Fiction-like movie hits theaters May 13.

Paramore has had a lot on its plate lately and the band plans to keep it that way for awhile.
A couple weeks ago, singer Hayley Williams, guitarist Taylor York and bassist Jeremy Davis, laid down some tracks with producer Rob Cavallo for their next album. While many of the songs are finished being recorded, the band doesn’t expect to release anything until summer.
Amid recording in Los Angeles, the group decided to contribute to Japan’s earthquake and tsunami relief efforts by holding an auction the band named “Paramore Yard Sale,” which took place online on April 2 and 4.
Auction items included used gear and old clothes worn during past tours and other occasions. All of the proceeds were given to the Red Cross.
Between recording new music, philanthropic work, being added to select dates for this summer’s Vans Warped Tour and most recently battling Green Day for MTV’s Musical March Madness, the names and faces of the band have been all over the place.
While Paramore may be getting a lot of attention, Williams managed to steal some of the spotlight by gracing the cover of the May issue of Cosmopolitan Magazine.
On the band’s LiveJournal blog, Williams talked about being hesitant to say yes to Cosmo because she was used to saying no to other magazines, such as Blender when she was 19.
Her goal has been to keep the focus less on her and more on the band, but obviously that has never worked in the past.
Williams has decided to embrace the attention to use it as a way to show girls how to be true to themselves and love themselves for the way they are.
“All three of us in Paramore have our own roles and finally I will accept mine. I’m going to be okay with being a ‘powerful female’ and if that’s what it is… I’m going to use that role to make a difference,” she wrote.

As Republicans and Democrats continue to spar over this year’s budget, the prospect of a partial government shutdown looms.
Both  parties have agreed that they want to avoid a government shutdown at  all costs, however, a government shutdown may hinge on funding for  Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which provides reproductive  health materials and child health services to Americans free of charge.
Republicans  refuse to pass a budget deal that supports Planned Parenthood,  asserting that Planned Parenthood uses government funds to cover the  cost of abortions, a key policy issue for Republicans.
Democrats  have accused Republicans of becoming bogged down in policy and moral  issues rather than considering the fragile state of the American  economy.
If  a budget deal is not reached by late tonight, starting tomorrow  non-essential government services will be suspended. Those include  passport services, National Parks, and national museums amongst other  services and government entities.
As many as 800,000 government employees could be affected by a partial government shutdown.
U.S. Military, air transportation, Amtrak and the U.S. Postal Service will continue to operate and function according to plan.
Although  tax refunds for those filing on paper could be delayed, federal income  taxes are still required to be paid by April 16, according to the  Internal Revenue Services.
The  last government shutdown, which occurred in 2005 under then-President  Clinton, cost the government approximately $1.5 billion.
