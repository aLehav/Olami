Reacting to the stalled economy, the  Alternative Winter and Spring Break programs are giving students more choices in domestic destinations for the service trips and helping them find creative ways to fund their trips.
Though the number of participants in Alternative Winter and Spring Break programs remains the same as last year, more students than ever are asking about scholarship opportunities, payment options and fundraising, according to Melissa Gaeke, director of Alternative Spring Break.
Gaeke said the Alternative Winter and Spring Break programs are doing their best to accommodate possible participants who are concerned about the cost of the trips in order to ensure a successful spring break for all who are interested.
Already, Gaeke said, fundraising efforts have increased.
“We are doing a lot more fundraising this year. The fundraising has been done through places like California Pizza Kitchen, 21 Choices and Yogurtland,” said Gaeke. “We’re trying any way to reduce the cost as much as possible for the students and their families.”
To keep costs down, Alternative Spring Break is also boosting the number of local options offered. Gaeke hopes these local destinations will be more affordable choices for those who think the international service programs are too costly.
Though international programs can cost anywhere from $915 to $2,500, domestic programs range from free trips to ones costing $800.
Alice Hyun, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the new Alternative Spring Break options are a better fit for her budget.
“If cost were not a problem at all, I would have applied to go to an international site, Guatemala, but I’m going to have to apply to a domestic site instead,”  Hyun said. “Even though cost is an issue, I still want to do something productive with my spring break.”
Some of the new, domestic programs include a civic leadership program in Atlanta and a program on Catalina Island in partnership with the Wrigley Institute.
Despite the fundraising and increase in domestic destinations, some students still find Alternative Break programs too costly.
“I was considering doing alternative spring break, but extra fundraising can only go so far,” said Ravi Mahesh, a sophomore majoring in economics. “I’m really sad that I can’t do one of the volunteer programs. I’ll probably end up volunteering somewhere closer to home where the costs are less expensive instead.”
Though some students have chosen not to apply, Gaeke emphasized that interest is still strong because people still want to serve the community and to travel.
“The reason students are applying isn’t different,” Gaeke said. “More and more students recognize these are interesting opportunities, want to travel and see parts of the world or the country other than road-tripping with their friends, and learn more about themselves through community service.”

With Swine Flu continuing to plague the nation, the rising number of cases on crowded, concentrated colleges campuses has prompted some schools to restrict parties and other social activities, a step USC health officials say they won’t consider.
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in upstate New York made headlines recently with their aggressive approach to H1N1. In a standard weekly email, RPI’s Health Director Dr. Leslie Lawrence urged students to avoid drinking games.
RPI is not the first school to recognize the dangers of drinking games and drink sharing. In September, Cornell University banned fraternity parties for a brief period because of a growing number of H1N1 cases. Other schools have taken similar steps.
But Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center, said USC would not take any similar precautions.
Neinstein recognized the connection between sharing drinks and Swine Flu. He said the number of Swine Flu cases on campus was highest at the start of the semester, a fact he credits to the partying that accompanies rush and other crowded social gatherings.
Yet, Neinstein said, parties are not the only way H1N1 spreads.
Sharing liquids is “one of 50 things that are public health related,” Neinstein said. “Why do you choose one? I don’t think that it’s enforceable. You need to get people to know and take personal responsibility for their health.”
Still, students said they think USC should consider issuing a warning specific to parties and drinking games.
“It is important for USC to try and support a healthy and safe community,” said Will Obre, a junior majoring in public relations. “It is especially important to promote smart health decisions in one of the biggest Greek communities on the west coast. So, I believe that USC should issue a similar warning [to RPI’s] to the entire campus.”
Should the number of cases rise to an unmanageable level USC would alter its course of action accordingly, Neinstein said.
“There are potential actions that could be done at that secondary higher level, but no one’s saying that we’re even close to that,” Neinstein said. “Suppressing beer games when you’ve got that kind of level is not where you’d need to look at. You’d have to look at social events, athletic events, concerts, teaching methods, and more.”
Ultimately, Neinstein said the best way to see the greatest possible reduction in Swine Flu among college students is for students to get vaccinated with the newly released flu shot. USC students can be vaccinated free of charge at the Lyon Center on November 3 and 4.

On a sleepy August morning, a man sorting through a Buena Park Dumpster found a suitcase stuffed with the mangled remains of a female body.
Authorities identified her as Jasmine Fiore, a swimsuit model. They believed that the man she was last seen with — Ryan Jenkins, a contestant and finalist on VH1 reality show Megan Wants a Millionaire — had murdered her.
Criminal mind · Charles Manson is led to court after being arrested. He is one of the many notorious figures in LA’s gruesome crime history. - Photo courtesy of LIFE
Jenkins was later found dead in a Canadian motel room after he hanged himself.
American historian and Cal State Fullerton  lecturer on American Studies Craig Loftin, who earned his doctorate from USC, calls Fiore’s murder just another classic LA crime. The location of her corpse, how it was mutilated and how Jenkins subsequently hanged himself falls in line with the other tragedies that have made the LA area famous.
The first, and perhaps most infamous of these atrocities, the Black Dahlia murder, took place during the city’s postwar economic boom. A young Elizabeth Short — who, like many others, had come to Los Angeles to reinvent herself as an actress — was found cut to pieces and left in an abandoned lot in Leimert Park.
The crime remains unsolved.
Such grisliness was not just played over repeatedly in the newspaper headlines, but also by the noir of the LA crime reality, amplified and sensationalized by the media machine that existed at the birth of the city­ — and even more so now.
“LA has a real dichotomy,” Loftin said. “People come here to make it big. There’s this kind of ‘sunniness’ about the place … The reality is that … people don’t become celebrities. They find the city alienating.”
The inherent loneliness in LA’s surroundings to outsiders is seen in how filmmakers depict the city in films like Sunset Boulevard, LA Confidential and Changeling. They create what Loftin calls a “visual vocabulary” that reinforces the idea that things aren’t what they seem.
Loftin believes girls like the Black Dahlia are “the victim of these evil forces that seem to be lurking in the shadows of the city.”
To make matters darker, the police seem to be ineffective in the face of truly violent crimes like the Charles Manson murders and recent Fiore/Jenkins travesty.
“There’s a long history of lawlessness … the police are … just as bad as the criminals,” Loftin said. “If you can’t go to the police, who can you trust? That’s the noir world in a nutshell.”
In this melodrama of mistrust and mishap, there’s a sense of fatalism. Los Angeles’ landscape seems like the perfect place for murder; the open canyons act like gaping mouths ready to swallow the weak and wicked whole.
Loftin credits the city’s unique situation as a “celebrity factory” for the prominence of LA atrocities. Crimes such as the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson, countless celebrity overdoses and other strange deaths — not to mention the recently media-revived Roman Polanski crime — will inherently be magnified by the press that creates those celebrities.
“The media coats our mind with the idea that there’s this unspeakable evil here,” Loftin said. “With Jenkins … the mystery, the excess … taps into … this bizarre fascination with celebrities and their dark side.”
It’s even glaringly easy to find the addresses of the residences in which these crimes took place. Three such high profile, legendary cases are within 15-minute drives of each other.
The property where members of Manson’s “hippie cult” slaughtered Hollywood elites has since been rebuilt, but the same lonely, narrow road the murders traveled still remains.
No streetlights illuminate Cielo Drive, and in place of the original house is an estate covered by a towering wooden gate, the slats resembling ominous yellowing teeth.
Nearby in Laurel Canyon lies the original stucco house where the 1981 Wonderland Avenue murders took place. In this instance, someone brutally clobbered five people with a lead pipe, killing four of them — and left gallons of blood on the walls.
The other 1970s-era houses seem harmless enough with charming Halloween decorations and well-kept trees, but the notorious house leaves its garage open, like the gaping mouth of a cave with a dusty Jeep inside. Steep stairs lead up to a metal door with no doorbell.
West of Wonderland Avenue lies the site of the Menendez killings, where two brothers shot their parents and marred their mother’s face past the point of recognition.
The two had been known to engage in a lavish lifestyle, but, after their parents’ death, they immediately started to chip away at their $14-million settlement.
Though the two brothers still live in separate cells in different prisons — both, curiously enough, with prison correspondence wives — the mansion where they slaughtered their parents is being massively refurbished.
On a Friday night in the wealthy neighborhood, teenagers park their brand new sports cars to attend what appears to be some 11th-grader’s red-cup reception. One can’t help but wonder if these teenagers know that next door, two children of the same Hollywood royalty they belong to now once committed an unspeakable act.
At the end of a hidden Beverly Hills private driveway — eerily named Elm Street — is a gated property with politely taped public notices of demolition times. The property within, obscured by a chain-link fence and scaffolding, seems a massive black mass with unnervingly deep-looking ditches.
Even if Angelenos don’t believe in ghosts, they obsess over those memories and are haunted by the crimes of their fellow city-dwellers who seemed to have lost their humanity somewhere in the search for money and fame.
We all know, after all, what it’s like to gaze into the valleys below and see the darkness below — and within.

It seemed like such a good idea in August. You didn’t have too much work for class. You were fresh of a relaxing family vaction.  Of course you’ll want to see your parents in October. Parents weekend! Perfect!
But now it’s two days away and all of a sudden tailgating with Mom and Dad does not seem as fun as it did. Plus you have midterms and papers and projects and booty calls— there’s just not enough time.
And on top of all that, your mom is texting you every four minutes to confirm their estimated time of arrival, and to make sure you made reservations and to confirm “the Vagabond Inn isn’t that bad, is it?”
Yes, it can all be a bit overwhelming. But remember why you really wanted them here in the first place: to show off! To dazzle them with your newfound independence and self-sufficiency! To remind them why they agreed to let you move a thousand miles away from home and live with a bunch of glorified teenagers!
And once you’re done showing them how responsible and independent you are, they can take you to Costco to buy food. Because really, Lucky Charms is not an acceptable dinner food.

Not long after the his inaugural address, President Barack Obama mentioned that he was planning to use some of his influence to get college football into a playoff system and eliminate the controversial BCS computer ranking system that is being used today to determine who plays for the National Championship.
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, whose undefeated state home team was shunned from the national championship last season, is urging that Obama make a decision now rather than later in a 10-page letter where he is advocating an antitrust probe against the BCS rankings.
Hatch thinks that the BCS has a “strong case” of violating antitrust laws, stating that the system “has been designed to limit the number of teams from non-privileged conferences that will play in BCS games.”
Hatch quoted the Sherman Antitrust Act, saying the BCS constitutes a “contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce.”
Utah is not alone in the BCS controversy. USC was ranked No. 1 in the AP and USA Today polls in 2003, but was No. 3 in the BCS, so was not eligible to play in the national championship game.
In 2004, five teams ended the season undefeated — USC, Oklahoma, Auburn, Utah, and Boise State. USC and Oklahoma were selected by the BCS to play in the national championship at the Orange Bowl.
This isn’t just about letting fair be fair, however; Hatch’s intentions also come down to the amount of revenue generated by bowl playing teams, and the things that that money can do to help out a school’s athletic prowess.
The hundreds of millions of dollars generated by college football “are hardly trivial sums,” according to Hatch, and that many schools use the money to fund other athletic programs.
The Justice Department said the letter would be reviewed and responded to as appropriate, and both the White House and BCS officials declined to comment.

The USC women’s tennis team is sending nine of its 10 players to compete today in the 2009 Wilson/ITA Southwest Regional held at the Barnes Tennis Center in San Diego, Calif.
In contrast to the Trojans’ last ITA tournament, the Riviera, which involved a selection of Division-I players throughout the nation, this tournament focuses on their region, with competition from two Arizona schools and six Southern California schools.
Repeat · Maria Sanchez hopes to match her success in San Diego. - Jonathan Wong | Daily Trojan
Junior Maria Sanchez topped the singles and the doubles competition during last fall’s Regional play. And this weekend, Sanchez is hoping for the same kind of result.
During last year’s Regionals, three of the four players in the semifinals were from USC, which later led to an all-USC finals matchup between Sanchez and then-freshman Ali Ramos.
Although playing against a teammate happens mostly in the fall during individual tournaments, Sanchez said it’s never easy.
“It’s always tough playing a teammate because you want them to do well, but then you want to win when you play,” Sanchez said.
Two weeks ago, freshman Danielle Lao impressed her teammates during the Riviera by winning seven straight singles matches. Lao said she feels some pressure to produce again this weekend.
“People now know who you are and expect to see good things. That pressure is great enough to motivate me to perform and compete well,” Lao said.
Meanwhile, the other freshman on the team, Valeria Pulido, will play with the defending doubles champion Sanchez, while Lao will play with junior Lyndsay Kinstler. Juniors Leyla Entekhabi and Cristie Andrews and senior Sarah Fansler and Ramos will also represent the doubles teams.

Golden Tate was pretty good this past Saturday, but wait until you see what the other guys can do.
The Notre Dame junior receiver took a USC defense that had barely bent all season — and was almost never broken — and, well, broke it a bit.
Mighty threat · The 5-foot-6, 190-pound Oregon State running back Jacquizz Rodgers ran all over the Trojans in an upset victory in 2008. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
He had eight catches for 117 yards and two touchdowns — the first two through the air against USC all season long.
Now imagine what two Golden Tates could do against USC’s defense. Scary, right?
That’s the problem the Trojans will face Saturday, when Oregon State comes to town with the Rodgers brothers, Jacquizz and James.
Twice the skill, twice the playmaking ability.
USC will have its hands full.
“The Rodgers brothers are ridiculous,” USC coach Pete Carroll said Tuesday. “They’re both terrific football players. They can get you a number of different ways.”
Jacquizz can run between the tackles and outside of them. He dances through seams like a man on a tightrope, delicately measuring each step on his way to accomplishing some grand feat.
“He’s the style of runner that really demands of it your defense,” Carroll said. “You give him a crack, he can take it. If you make a mistake he’s going to take advantage of it.”
And did he ever take advantage of it last year. No one will forget the sophomore running back’s 186-yard, two-touchdown performance in the Beavers’ 27-21 victory in Corvallis, Ore. a season ago.
Jacquizz Rodgers became a household name.
This year, he’s on a staggering pace. In six games, he’s rushed for nearly 700 yards and 13 touchdowns — running behind a line with one starting senior.
He can catch the ball, too: 38 receptions for 269 yards.
“There’s no magic to it,” Oregon State coach Mike Riley said of his running back. “He’s a good player.”
A very good player.
When the ball is in his hands, look out. Thirteen touchdowns don’t happen by accident.
And his brother James?
His two-touchdown performance in last year’s upset seems to slip through the cracks, but nothing the junior wide receiver is doing is slipping through the cracks this year.
He leads the team in receptions with 43, receiving yards with 544, and has four touchdowns. He’s also averaging 15 yards per punt return and almost 23 yards per kick return.
He’s an electrifying player with incredible skills.
All of this presents a major problem for USC. How will the Trojans match up against the likes of two talented playmakers?
We saw the way Tate gave USC’s defense fits this past Saturday. He broke a big play on an incredible catch for a touchdown, beating redshirt senior cornerback Josh Pinkard to the ball. He prolonged the potential game-tying drive with a leaping catch over the middle.
Now imagine two players who can light it up like Tate on the field at the same time. Both can run and catch. They can make the plays to grind out yards just as well as they can burn you for the big play.
“We’ve got to put together a great week of preparation,” Carroll said. “It really calls for a strict approach to it this week.”
Carroll was pleased with the way his team started this week off in practice, but will that be enough to contain the Rodgers brothers?
The Trojans had two weeks to prepare for Tate, yet he nearly beat them in the second half, making six of his eight grabs in the final 30 minutes and scoring twice.
Yes, Tate does have junior quarterback Jimmy Clausen throwing him the football, and the Notre Dame line is ripe with seniors. And no, Oregon State senior quarterback Sean Canfield is not on Clausen’s level.
But Canfield is beginning to hit his stride, and the Beavers’ offense is clicking with three straight games of 28-plus points.
That means the offense is as explosive as it has been — and the Rodgers brothers are at the center of it.
Now it’s up to the Trojans to stop Jacquizz and James on Saturday. If they can’t, the fourth quarter won’t be the only troublesome quarter for USC.

In a week full of questions, one thing is certain. Fullback Stanley Havili doesn’t need surgery, at least not for now.
Havili dislocated his shoulder and tore ligaments during the game at Notre Dame. He hasn’t practiced all week and is questionable for the game Saturday against Oregon State. But it’ll take more than that for the senior fullback to miss a significant amount of time.
Status in doubt · Fullback Stanley Havili separated his shoulder against Notre Dame and is questionable for Saturday. MRI results revealed torn ligaments, but the redshirt junior will not have surgery this season. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
“We didn’t talk about [surgery] at all. I’m not having that conversation until the end of the season,” Havili said. “I’m not getting surgery during the season.”
With surgery out of the question, Havili is stabilizing his shoulder. But while Havili stays on the sidelines, the Trojans will turn to sophomore D.J. Shoemate to fill his shoes.
Until recently, USC coach Pete Carroll feared the day that Havili couldn’t play for the Trojans. But then Shoemate came along.
“We thought for the longest time we couldn’t find anyone that could replace Stanley. But I do think D.J.’s very capable of doing everything that Stanley can,” Carroll said. “He’s been out of the backfield more than Stanley has as far as lining up and running around. So he’s a really good kid for the position.”
Carroll actually recruited Shoemate to be a slot receiver. Shoemate played that position early in his high school career and then moved to running back his senior year. Carroll wanted Shoemate to get touches in the backfield, so fullback became his destination.
“He has shown that he can do everything and he has the kinds of qualities you need for the fullback spot,” Carroll said. “You have to be able to run, to catch. We thought we might be able to do something special with him and he winded up at fullback.”

Redshirt sophomore tailback Marc Tyler will need surgery on his foot. Tyler has been out with a sprained big toe since Sept. 10. He will most likely undergo surgery next week and he won’t be able to start jogging until January.
This leaves USC with only four scholarship tailbacks, as senior Stafon Johnson is also out for the year.
u
While it seems the Trojans are falling victim to the injury bug every week, one player is ready to rejoin the team. After crashing his motorcycle on the 110 Freeway Sept. 17, redshirt freshman Brian Baucham has resumed practice and is back in the competition for the third cornerback spot.
Baucham was the third cornerback before the accident, and T.J. Bryant has taken his spot in the nickel package. But Bryant still has favor with the coaching staff.
“Bach coming back changes things,” Carroll said. “But Bryant had a particularly good day today and yesterday. And he’s been playing on the inside which Bach hasn’t done.”
As for now, Baucham will remain behind Bryant on the depth chart.
u
Oregon State running back Jacquizz Rodgers has drawn heaps of praise from Carroll this week. Carroll expressed amazement about Rodgers’ streak of holding on to the football.
In his Beavers career, Rodgers has 387 rushes and 67 receptions, and he hasn’t lost one fumble.
“I can’t even imagine how he’s been able to get through that with all the carries,” Carroll said. “This is a guy that’s an every down, lead your team kind of guy. It’s really an amazing statistic.”

Defense wins championships.
This phrase may be cliché, but in the sports world, a solid defense almost seems like an afterthought — after all, you do need goals in soccer, runs in baseball or points in football to emerge victorious.
At USC, a star-studded offense overshadows a Trojan defense that has not been given enough credit for its play this season.
Taking flight · Sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo celebrates after the Trojans defense held off Notre Dame’s last-minute rally. Galippo anchors a defense that ranks fifth nationally, letting up only 11.7 points per game. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
The surplus of running backs at USC is always mentioned. True freshman quarterback Matt Barkley grabbed headlines after he was named the starter at the beginning of the season. Junior running back Joe McKnight and junior wide receiver Damian Williams are praised for their spectacular playmaking ability.
But what happened to the Trojans’ defense?
Other than senior safety Taylor Mays, this defense is largely unrecognized and perhaps underappreciated for its work so far this season.
After losing eight key players last year, it’s understandable to think that this would be a rebuilding year for the defense. But at USC, the plethora of talent is neverending.
Concerns over who would step in and fill those voids were raised prior to the start of the season. But the solid play of the new starters should put to rest any other doubts that may still be present.
Sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo is one of those players who has stepped in and played a significant role for the defense.
“He’s a terrific football player. He’s very bright and savvy and makes a lot of great decisions,” said USC coach Pete Carroll.
Galippo is the leading tackler for a team that is surrendering only 11.7 points per game, which ranks fifth nationally in scoring defense.
In addition to keeping opponents out of the end zone, the Trojans are holding opposing offenses to just 260 yards per game, which ranks ninth nationally in total defense. They are also only allowing 67.7 rushing yards, which ranks fourth nationally.
“These guys took the challenge that they wouldn’t allow this defense to take a step backwards because of the guys leaving,” Carroll said.
The backbone of last year’s defense was the core of linebackers that included Rey Maualuga, Brian Cushing, Clay Matthews and Kaluka Maiava. All four players moved onto the NFL and were arguably the best group of linebackers in college football history.
Last year, they anchored a defense that only allowed nine points per game, 221.7 yards per game and 87.4 rushing yards per game.
This year’s defense has held its own through the first six games of the season.
“They’ve played great football. They’ve played the run really well, taken care of the deep balls and the passing game is really difficult on our opponents,” Carroll said.
Prior to the contest versus Notre Dame last weekend, the USC defense had not allowed a touchdown through the air.
Galippo is healthy for the first time in his USC career. The former standout from Servite High School only played three games his freshman year because of to a herniated disc that required season-ending back surgery. In 2008, Galippo underwent another back surgery prior to the football season, but he served as the backup middle linebacker that season.
After undergoing two back surgeries, Galippo reflects on his time off from playing football.
“It made me work harder … and sitting behind guys like Rey, Cushing and guys like that, I learned a lot,” he said.
Now, he is getting an opportunity to showcase his abilities.
In the second game of the season versus then-No. 8 Ohio State, Galippo intercepted a pass thrown by quarterback Terrelle Pryor and returned it to the two-yard line. The interception set up the first touchdown of the game for the Trojans and the score proved critical in a game in which both offenses were stymied.
Meanwhile, it was the defense that would not budge and held Ohio State to three-and-outs. It was the defense that would not let Ohio State steal a victory. This defense was solid throughout the entire game and gave the offense a chance to win at the end.
Against Cal, the USC defense held Heisman-hopeful running back, junior running back Jahvid Best, to just 47 rushing yards on 14 carries. Not too bad considering Best was averaging almost seven yards per carry prior to the contest.
Even when the Trojans’ defense is not at its best, its resiliency and determination shine through.
This past weekend at Notre Dame was a huge test for the defense as it tried to slow down Heisman-candidate junior quarterback Jimmy Clausen and the electrifying junior wide receiver, Golden Tate.
Through the first three quarters, the Trojans continually pressured Clausen and shut down the Fighting Irish’s running game.
In the final quarter, Notre Dame cut the lead to a single touchdown. With nine seconds to play and the Fighting Irish at the USC four-yard line, the Trojans’ defense held strong in a goal line stand.
“We are much better this year than we were last year,” Mays said.
Now that Galippo is finally healthy, his contributions and stellar play have provided stability for the defensive unit. Playing for one of the top football programs in the nation, he said, “is something [he] always dreamed of” and it is no surprise that he is fulfilling, and perhaps exceeding, the expectations that heralded him a five-star recruit out of high school.
“He’s done a tremendous job and [the coaching staff] is pleased with the way he’s been developing,” said USC defensive coordinator Rocky Seto.
With Galippo in the middle anchoring the linebackers and Mays providing an experienced, imposing presence in the secondary, can the Trojans’ defense play any better?
“We’re still trying to get better and we’re still trying to improve,” Seto said.
So far, the defense has been nothing but rock solid.

Entering the room in a sunny yellow dress like the last breath of summer, Kristen Bell looks the part of a glamorous, unattainable movie star. But right away, she proves that she can roll with the punches.
With a smile as infectious as her laugh, Bell’s demeanor permeates the room with good humor and a side of loveable sarcasm. In person she is sassy, evoking her character Veronica Mars more than one would expect.
Up and away · Astro Boy follows a newly created robot as he tries to find an identity in the human world. Along the way, he befriends Cora (Kirsten Bell), a spunky, tough-talking orphan. The movie is Bell’s second voice-over work; previously, she lent her voice to a 2008 video game. - Photo courtesy of Summit Entertainment
Bell’s roles display not only her talent but also her versatility. From debuting as a teenage detective in Veronica Mars to having guest stints on Heroes, voicing the deliciously evil narrator on Gossip Girl and becoming one of Judd Apatow’s leading ladies in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, it appears that Bell is on the brink of superstardom — which makes her latest choice of projects so fascinating. It doesn’t appear as if she will be portraying any Nicole Kidman-esque wilting flowers any time soon.
“I mean for me, my appearance lends itself more to being cast as an ingénue, but so often ingénues are boring,” Bell said. “They don’t have a lot of depth.”
So bring on the sass. Bell prefers the challenge of a strong female character, which is evident in her newest project, Astro Boy. A huge pop culture icon in Japan, Astro Boy comes with a heavy history behind it — something Bell was not familiar with before.
“I had known the name in the back of my head for a while, but I didn’t know why he was so significant or what the story really was,” Bell said. “But after I read the script, I became familiar with how iconic he was overseas and how he’s kind of the Mickey Mouse of Japan.”
Not entirely new to the field of voice-over work (she lent her voice to Ubisoft’s 2008 game Assassin’s Creed), Bell was excited to once again test her vocal chops on this film. But, some of the same challenges still arose.
“In the recording booth you have to give the director the option of a less intense line or a more intense line depending on what your co-star gives,” Bell explained.
Another challenge? Wardrobe.
“You don’t realize that animated characters don’t change clothes. In a movie you can tell a lot about a character by how they dress: Are they preppy or are they disheveled? You have one choice in the animated characters life, you show one outfit,” Bell said.
Despite the lack of wardrobe choices, it seems that Bell had no problem connecting with her character, Cora, a down-and-out orphan who befriends Astro. The two shared (what else?) sassiness.
“She’s spunky, she’s opinionated, she’s kind of rebellious. She’s got a tough exterior but she’s a marshmallow on the inside and all of that appealed to me,” she said. “I sometimes have a tougher exterior and it’s always covering up for some insecurity or another. I’m probably just as sassy as she is.”
With a smile full of mischief, Bell adds: “People have said that.”
But it wasn’t just Cora’s character that intrigued Bell. The screenplay and the subtleties in the writing were an added bonus.
“I just really liked the script in general. It had a lot of really great themes and I was excited to be a part of it. It has a great message that’s not shoved down your throat,” Bell said. “It’s a great adventure movie and despite the name I think little girls will like it as well. I mean I get to say that because I’m representing the females in this film.”
Being the only girl with a gaggle of guys is no new feat for Bell. She recently starred Couples Retreat with comedy heroes Vince Vaughn and her on-screen husband Jason Bateman, who were as funny off-screen as they were on.
“One thing I can say about them is they are exactly how you want them to be. They are two of the funniest and nicest guys that you’ll ever meet,” Bell confessed. “Jason prided himself every morning by telling me how bloated I looked because he knew it would make me laugh.”
With two movies opening within two weeks — the other being Couples Retreat — and a series of others to follow (When In Rome, Sheepish and You Again) it appears that Bell has no intention of slowing down. Although the business can be a harsh environment, it is refreshing to find that Bell always strives to keep it light.
“I realized you’re kind of a joke if you ever get jaded because this job is fun, it’s meant to be fun and it’ll be fun until you’re 87,” Bell said.

Before talking about what the Kings of Convenience’s new album Declaration of Dependence is, let’s clarify what it isn’t: experimental or innovative. That’s not to say that it’s a boring, irrelevant album — in fact, the track list flows brilliantly, which is more than some other modern albums can say — but if you’re expecting to be shocked and awe-stricken, you will be disappointed.
For everyone else, you’re in luck.
Safe and sound · Norway’s Kings of Convenience delivers another round of intimate acoustic ballads on its latest release, Declaration of Dependence. As with its previous three albums, the folk duo’s song lyrics delve into the well-explored themes of love and romance. - Photo courtesy of EMI
Kings of Convenience, from Bergen, Norway, is comprised of Erlend Øye and Eirik Bøe. The duo has received critical acclaim for its specific brand of quiet, intricate folk music, and Dependence continues to deliver. Here, the band skillfully weaves songs with a common thread: the trials and tribulations of love. Even if the subject material isn’t exactly new, its willingness to sing about bare emotions without pretense or irony is refreshing.
Kings of Convenience channels its inner Simon and Garfunkel, revamping the famous folk team with modern indie sensibilities. It makes for solidly written, poetic music, but it lacks experimentation or innovation in recording technique or songwriting. The result snares the listener with calm, catchy melodies, but fails to expand on it.
There isn’t much to be hidden, lyrically speaking. The duo sings straightforwardly without seeming corny, which, these days, seems to be a gift.
She’ll be gone soon/You can have me for yourself, the two croon in harmony on the album opener “24-25,” But do give, just give me today/Or you will just scare me away. Lyrics like this prove Dependence is not a political rant or a swaggering monologue, but rather a moving look at the experience of romance.
Although songs about love could lead to a minefield of musical clichés, Dependence is somehow able to navigate this warzone without much ado, primarily because the songs don’t disintegrate into anthems of loneliness, á la Dashboard Confessional.  Instead, Øye and Bøe merely seem to reflect on observations made through experience. The lyrics avoid stereotypical heartache and that makes up for the safe sounds that accompany them.
Admittedly, there is a formula in place. All the songs feature delicately intricate instrumental melodies and harmonized vocals. The songs seem indistinguishable from one another at first, which might turn some people off. With patience, the tunes become unique entities.
“Mrs. Cold,” for instance, takes inspiration from Brazilian bossa nova with a jaunty double bass groove while “Boat Behind” combines wistful poetry with a melody delivered via viola. And then there are songs, such as “Rule My World” and “Freedom and Its Owner,” that are executed with the traditional dual attack of intertwined acoustic guitars.
In this age of over-processed, overbearing music, maybe their lack of experimentation is appropriate. Kings of Convenience doesn’t lose sight of what’s important about songwriting in the first place and instead proves that songs can be great not only because of what they are, but also because of what they’re not.

Clue No. 1: “What three  Downtown streets intersect where Saint Peter turns Japanese?”
This was CityRace. It wasn’t The Amazing Race, but it sure seemed like it on the Saturday morning in September when my team members and I — we cleverly called ourselves Team Daily Trojan — read the first clue and felt the adrenaline of competition. It was like a victorious Rocky scene, if the four of us girls could be muscular men. We didn’t know or care what the prize was, but we wanted it.
Sarah Bennett | Daily Trojan
The localized scavenger hunt, CityRace, and it’s citywide counterpart, Race/LA, were created by John Hennessy to give people the real-life experience that those on reality shows like The Amazing Race are able to have: the rush of a race, the intensity of solving a puzzle or math problem and the feeling of accomplishment when it’s all over.
“The Amazing Race is totally my favorite show,” Hennessey confessed.
Hennessy began his hunt-organizing business with Race/LA, investigating and constructing all of the scavenger hunt’s clues on his own, and using volunteers and part-time staff members to help run the race itself.
“We surveyed everyone who did Race/LA when it was over and a lot of people told us that they wished there were more mental challenges than physical,” Hennessy said.
So while Race/LA aims to put on a day-long, physically challenging race that is completed mostly by car through all of Los Angeles, Hennessy created CityRace to give contestants a similar experience in less time but with more mental challenges. CityRaces are three-hour mini races and tours around a specific section of Los Angeles, like Little Tokyo or Hollywood, with no running, driving or physicality involved.
Although CityRace is more relaxed and can be completed in teams of two, three or four, Race/LA is done in teams of two and at least one member of the team must be 21 years of age. In essence, Race/LA is much more like the television show than CityRace, but both programs have been wildly successful (Race/LA has been running since 2004, CityRace since 2007) as a way for tourists and even native Angelenos to spend a day or less learning about Los Angeles in a more interactive way than sitting on a sightseeing bus.
At first, CityRace can seem like an impossible task (and Race/LA is likely even more daunting). If you’re anything like Team Daily Trojan, that first clue is enough to make you run far, far away and not even attempt the race. But Hennessy ensures that the races aren’t too difficult.
“After I create each of the races, I do a test run-through and make sure the clues make sense and aren’t impossible to figure out. Sometimes people are willing to test [the races] out for me after they have done CityRaces before,” Hennessy said. “And it’s only happened a few times where people couldn’t finish.
Even then, that was because they were sick or something, and left a message at our office.”
But especially since these races aren’t free (CityRace is $35 per person), why quit? Get to work, like my team members did, and continue reading the clue packet. While the first 25 clues may be altogether unintelligible, clue 26 may be able to get you started. Once a team finds just one answer — which they will, even if they know nothing about LA — momentum builds.
“I like when a team is really super competitive, because I think that’s how I would be. When people come and run from the start, it’s always exciting,” Hennessy said.
Our team did a little bit of running, but the clues were fairly easy to solve in three hours without running. Some clues were pictures or puzzles, while others were fill-in-the-blank type answers; a few were even math-related. After three hours, we were exhausted but satisfied. We had answered every clue and arrived earlier than other teams, which can be beneficial if two teams tie for first, since time is then taken into account.
Once everyone arrived back at “base camp,” Hennessy read off the answers to the clues — Clue No. 1 was looking for where San Pedro Street becomes Judge John Aiso Street at 1st Street — and announced the winners. We came in third place, losing to a team that had previously done a CityRace. Of course we ultimately wanted to win, but the experience itself was satisfying enough. For the price of dinner and a movie, we had learned more about Little Tokyo than we would ever need to know, and felt great about it.
“I want people to say that they had seen a part of the city they and never seen before,” Hennessy said. “That’s kind of the exciting thing about it — that people are always discovering new places.”

As a general rule, when something is broken, it’s in the interest of at least one party to try to fix it.
The task of remedying the situation is made even easier if the root of the problem is easily identifiable.

These statements seem like no-brainers that merit no further argument.
Unless, of course, you’re the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen.
On Friday, Sept. 12, 2008, a Metrolink commuter train collided head-on with a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, Calif., leaving 25 people dead and more than 135 injured in what turned out to be the deadliest US train crash in the last 15 years.
The resulting investigation into the cause of the crash determined that the conductor of the Metrolink train failed to stop at a red light that indicated it was unsafe to proceed.
While records show that the operator of the other train deployed emergency brakes immediately before the crash, the operator of the Metrolink train, engineer Rob Sanchez, failed to do so.
Though fatigue was thought to be a prime contributor to the crash, after further digging it investigators discovered that Sanchez had been texting on his cell phone throughout the entire train ride, including a message that was sent just 22 seconds before the time of the crash.
Though there were not regulations in place at the time of the incident, the Federal Railroad Administration passed an order restricting the use of personal electronic or electric devices by railroad operators shortly after the incident.
In direct response to the Chatsworth incident, Metrolink announced a plan to outfit all of its 52 passenger trains with cameras in the cab of each locomotive, where the engineer controls the movement of the train cars.
The idea is that the placement of cameras will help to promote safety by providing a live feed of what’s going on inside and outside of the train.
Also, by placing a camera near the control panel for the train, the hope is that train engineers and conductors will become acutely aware of the fact that they are being watched and refrain from any questionable behavior — like the type that could potentially cause another deadly train crash.
Problem solved.
Unfortunately, the union that represents Metrolink conductors, the aforementioned Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, has taken issue with this new policy and has filed a federal lawsuit to stop the implementation of camera systems aboard Metrolink’s commuter trains.
According to the lawsuit, cameras in the locomotive cab violate the right to privacy granted to the trainmen and passengers alike by the federal government. Ironically, they propose the illegal jamming of cell phones and texting signals as a better alternative to help curb any distracting activities.
Realistically, what privacy issues could arise from having a camera inside of the cab? The pressure of knowing that someone is monitoring your on-the-job actions isn’t unheard of in the world of employment. In fact, their bus driver brethren seem to be doing just fine with cameras mounted at the front of busses.
If anything, the norm is that issues of personal privacy are secondary to work safety and productivity in the professional world — just ask any number of employees who have been reprimanded or fired for the content of questionable emails.
The dramatic concern over this policy to prevent future accidents begs the question: What exactly goes on inside of these cabs that warrants such uproar about privacy rights?
The size of a typical locomotive cab is not much larger than that of an airplane cockpit, and is not wholly conducive to small-scale dance parties, cage fighting or any other potentially distracting activity.
Such constraints make it hard to believe that there is much room to do anything other than sit and monitor the progress of the train, especially given the great responsibility of ensuring the safety and well-being of the multitude of passengers being transported.
So where again does privacy fit into the equation?
It doesn’t.
One can logically assume, then, that privacy is only a means of saying that they’d rather not get caught slacking off on the job.
Maybe the greater issue is that trainmen and railroaders face long, fatiguing shifts that put them in situations where lapses in attention could occur.
But to let off steam regarding “privacy” issues seems curious and raises questions about the professionalism of the railroad workers.
If the goal of the union is to protect the reputation of locomotive engineers and trainmen by preventing exposure of shoddy on-the-job habits, it appears they’ve only succeeded in derailing the cause.

Last Sunday’s AIDS Walk served as an enlightening, and perhaps haunting, reminder to many about the prevalent pandemic. Despite the ample attention, money and effort being poured into generating awareness about HIV, it continues to be a destructive presence: 7,500 new people are infected with HIV every day, and AIDS remains the fourth leading cause of death globally.
Clearly, battling the onslaught of AIDS is a struggle for our generation.
With the announcement of relative success for a preliminary AIDS vaccine, one would expect a celebratory response from the international community. Such a pre-emptive action would significantly lower the risk of contracting the disease before it even takes root and subsequently minimize the number of infected people.
Results published Tuesday from a six-year study — a collaboration between entities such as the Thai Health Ministry and the United States military — tested an AIDS vaccine on more than 16,000 volunteers, who reported a lowered risk of infection by 31.2 percent. The study was the first hint that a successful vaccine for the disease was even possible. However, a simultaneous analysis was released citing that the success was only “modest” and the trend of the protection wasn’t statistically significant.
The two analyses, particularly the second one, were met with a lackluster, less-than-sanguine response from critics, who were overwhelmingly doubtful of the vaccine’s success. Many already have qualms about such a discovery — as if a cure were too good to be true given our current resources and means.
Attitudes like these, tainted by pessimism rather than hope, unfortunately undermine further research to find an effective AIDS vaccine. In fact, spending for vaccine research and development has dropped 10 percent since last year and has been eclipsed by efforts for treatment instead.
Whether it’s through governments, non-governmental organizations or private coalitions, innovative action needs to be taken to battle AIDS. Despite the cost that vaccine research entails, it ought to be pursued. Reliance solely on treatment surely cannot be the solution.
Although treatment is clearly helpful and a source of hope for those infected, it only allays the onslaught of the pandemic and doesn’t make any strides to abolish it.
Programs such as the (RED) campaign and the World Health Organization’s “3 by 5” Initiative are commendable for their efforts to treat those afflicted with HIV, but these short-term accomplishments won’t do as much to directly benefit posterity as a preventative cure would. And for our generation, mere treatment doesn’t stop the spread.
“We, for the first time, have evidence of protection,” Dr. Alan Bernstein, executive director of the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise, told the Associated Press. “And the nitty-gritty [arguments] to me don’t matter a damn.”
If a scientist can disregard setbacks like this, the general public should follow suit.
Believing that the AIDS vaccine is impossible engenders an attitude of inaction. But, if we “imagine a world without AIDS,” as the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative supports, the optimism just may parlay into something concrete, useful and lifesaving. We’re selling ourselves short by not entertaining the idea of an AIDS vaccine, and it might serve us well to maintain some sort of optimism when it comes to discovering a cure for the disease.
Nadine Tan is a sophomore majoring in business administration (international relations).
Why YES, Nadine, this is brilliant. Let’s just ignore the reality, that the so-called vaccine is hardly promising at all, and put on a happy face! That will solve everything! Oh, and of course we must spend lots more money on misguided research by “scientists” who “disregard setbacks” … fighting a disease that can be pretty much avoided completely by using your brain and, oh I don’t know, a condom. Or whatever. Why is so much money being spent on this disease that is largely preventable? Politicized science is the worst kind, because its “results” are not to be trusted.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Department of Public Safety crime/incident summary between Friday, Oct. 16 and Wednesday, Oct. 20.
Crimes against a person
On oct. 19 at 8:10 p.m. a suspect approached a student from behind as she exited the Norris Medical Center and punched her in the side of the head without provocation. The suspect then fled on foot and could not be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers.
Miscellaneous incidents
on oct. 16 at 6:20 p.m. a student reported that a suspect knocked on the door of her apartment in the City Park complex and she did not answer because she did not recognize him when she looked through the peep hole.  The student continued to stand by the door and observed the suspect unlock it.  When the suspect pushed the door open the student slammed it closed and yelled that she was calling the police.  The suspect then fled and he could not be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers.
on oct. 16 at 3:50 a.m. a male student who was sleepwalking walked into a female student’s Century apartment and used the restroom. The female student did not know this person and notified DPS that a stranger entered her apartment.
on oct. 19 at 6:10 p.m. a student drove her vehicle into the rear of a university tram driven by a staff member, causing minor damage to the tram and moderate damage to the student’s vehicle.
on oct. 20 at 1 a.m. DPS officers responded to a report of students at the Moon apartment complex making excessive noise and swimming in the pool after hours.  The officers heard no noise upon their arrival, and when they contacted the students one of them admitted that he had been swimming in the pool.  The students were cooperative and the officers cleared the scene after advising them to keep the noise down and stay out of the pool.
Re: Sleeppeeing
LOCK YOUR DOORS how the heck does a stranger enter an apartment at 4am?!? this is why crime happens (aside from sleeppeeing). do your families leave your front doors unlocked at night?
