No. 10 Women’s soccer secured a comeback victory over No. 9 Stanford Sunday in front of fans at Soni McAlister Field. Despite entering halftime with a 2-0 deficit, goal contributions from leading season goalscorer, junior midfielder Croix Bethune, and freshman forward Simone Jackson led the Trojans to a victory for their last home game of the conference season. 
In the 32nd minute, USC conceded the first goal when a deflection from senior defender Kaylin Martin granted Stanford a lead through an own goal. 
Stanford subsequently doubled its lead when junior midfielder Katie Duong sent a lob pass from a free kick to the penalty box, which eventually gave room to senior defender Naomi Girma who scored eight seconds before halftime. Stanford outshot USC 8-2 in the first half. 
“Our overall energy in the game wasn’t high enough in the first half which allowed [Stanford] a lot of possession and a lot of opportunities to shoot on goal,” said Head Coach Keidane McAlpine in a postgame interview. “We had to change the energy at halftime.”
The Trojans promptly responded to the deficit eight minutes into the second half when Jackson cut into the middle of the box and scored her fourth goal of the Pac-12 season. 
USC tied the match two minutes later when senior midfielder Savannah DeMelo provided a ground pass across the edge of the penalty box where Jackson allowed the ball to pass between her feet to allow Bethune to score the equalizer. The second half mirrored the first as USC outshot Stanford 8-2 en route to their equalizer. After 90 minutes, the score remained level as the game headed into overtime.
Three minutes into the first overtime period, DeMelo lobbed a pass to Bethune, who controlled possession in the penalty box, before rounding Stanford’s goalkeeper and slotting the winner into the empty net. 
Jackson received her third straight start as a replacement for injured senior forward Penelope Hocking. The freshman provided a goal and an assist en route to the Trojans’ comeback victory over Stanford. 
“I thought [Jackson] did a great job in the first half, especially against Washington, and she has carried that confidence forward,” McAlpine said. “With [Hocking] out, she has given us another threat out there to kind of take on and get after people.” 
Bethune’s heroics added to her prolific goal contribution tally this season, providing 8 goals and 6 assists in 10 Pac-12 matches. The midfielder, who plays as a forward under McAlpine’s system, scored five goals in her last three matches. 
“Croix was extremely important, especially in that second half,” McAlpine said. “She was a little frustrated in the first half, but I thought in the second half her energy changed [and the] team’s energy changed.”
USC’s comeback victory over Stanford continued the Trojans’ prolific run in the Pac-12 as they remain unbeaten in Pac-12 play with an 8-0-2 record. Following its efforts Sunday, USC have officially won all of its home games in the Pac-12. 
“This was another massive game for us,” McAlpine said. “Today’s huge, and it’s massive that we can get this kind of pressure against us and still come out on the other side.”
The Trojans’ victory sets stage for their final match of the Pac-12 season as they face crosstown rivals No. 5 UCLA in their conference title match that, in a draw or a win, would clinch the title for USC. The two teams will face off at 7 p.m. Friday at Wallis Annenberg Stadium.

For the past two semesters, the Daily Trojan has collected data for the diversity report as a way to hold ourselves accountable for the makeup of our staff and how newsroom diversity affects the paper’s reporting. This semester, we used the Spring 2021 Diversity Staff Report as a guideline for recruitment, especially considering we could expand recruitment with USC’s return to in-person classes. 
This report intends to both highlight diversity’s importance in the newsroom and to highlight the Daily Trojan’s areas of improvement.
It is also important to reflect on areas of improvement to maintain and cherish inclusive spaces for reporters who come from different backgrounds and identities. Throughout the spring 2021 and fall 2021 semesters, 12.54% of staffers identify as bisexual. And the number of staffers with a disability increased from 10.88% to 11.23%, bringing forth a voice so often lost in a majority non-disabled newsroom. 
Ultimately, the Daily Trojan conducts the following report because representation and inclusion  are of paramount importance to both the Daily Trojan and journalism as a whole. 
Methodology 
As done in the previous two semesters, the report asked staffers their class standing, race/ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality, student status — which includes the following identities: international, low-income, first-generation, spring admit, those receiving need-based financial aid and transfer status — and record of disability. 
The report documented these responses for both the entire staff and the individual Daily Trojan sections: news, opinion, arts & entertainment, sports, copy, features, photo, video, online projects, design, art, audience engagement, diversity & inclusion, data & investigative, podcasts, wellness & outreach, managing and the masthead, which consists of managing and section editors. 
The Daily Trojan recorded 204 staff responses to the survey out of 252 staffers, which is a  80.95% response rate — a 3.35% decrease from the Spring 2021 report’s 84.34% response rate. Sections with 100% responses from staffers included opinion, art, design, audience engagement, copy, diversity & inclusion, managing and the masthead. 
Analysis
Most numbers from the Spring 2021 Staff Report remained consistent in the fall. For example, the number of staffers who receive need-based financial aid was 22.57%. The number of transfer, first-generation and low-income staffers also remained consistent. The number of Black staffers, 5.13%, slightly increased from the spring 2021 semester of 4.35% but decreased from the fall 2020 semester, where Black students made up 6% of staffers. The number of Latinx staffers slightly increased for the fall semester, 15.95%, compared to the 15.68% of the spring 2021 semester.   
Areas where the Daily Trojan has usually reported high numbers experienced some declines.
South Asian staffers decreased from 14% to 10.54%; women on staff decreased from 72% to 63.58%. The number of male staffers in sports remains the majority, while the number of women staffers in both news and arts & entertainment make up the majority. 
However, the number of staffers who are trans women and nonbinary increased. Last semester, zero trans women were on staff, which increased to .33% in Fall 2021, while the number of nonbinary staffers increased from 1% to 3.31%. This increase is not sufficient but can be a stepping stone to curate a more welcoming environment for non-cis USC students. 
The masthead, which is made up of managing and section editors, is split almost 50-50 between men and women, 22.5% white and 53.33% straight. About 14% of the masthead disclosed living with a disability, 13.04% who are low-income, 30.43% who receive need-based financial aid and 21.74% are first-generation. 
Recognizing the masthead makeup is important because this group communicates most with the majority of staffers, who come from different backgrounds and identities. 
Next Steps 
The Fall 2021 staff saw new increases in inclusive representation, particularly in the numbers of trans women, nonbinary staffers and disabled people. To maintain an increase in representation from groups who are often not represented in reporting, the Daily Trojan must reflect on how to be more accessible and inclusive to these communities. 
The newsroom should also determine the reasons behind decreases or stagnant low numbers in key populations such as the number of Latinx staffers and its impact on reporting. For example, how did returning to campus either encourage or discourage students from joining the Daily Trojan? 
While this reflection on the staff report is only the first step toward creating a more diverse newsroom, we must also recognize the staff’s composition now and tend to the needs of the Daily Trojan for the semester. This attention means cultivating an inclusive community and communicating with the masthead so that staffers feel like a meaningful part of the newsroom and return in future semesters. 
In addition to this reflection, we must acknowledge our shortcomings in addressing our newsroom diversity from the goals outlined in the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 Diversity reports. We must go beyond simply reflection and outline tangible goals so that future reports actually depict progress in newsroom diversity. 
In Spring 2022, the Daily Trojan must use the opportunity of in-person learning to conduct outreach to specific underrepresented populations and work to encourage student participation in the physical newsroom. For instance, the Daily Trojan can expand its recruitment efforts beyond the Involvement Fair and reach out to student organizations  to connect with students from diverse backgrounds and magnify underrepresented voices in our newsroom. 
We will also reach out to other underrepresented groups by communicating with student leaders in campus organizations, such as the Latinx Student Assembly, LGBTQ+ Student Center, Native American Student Assembly and Asian Pacific American Student Services. From these communications, we hope to establish new avenues for inviting students into the Daily Trojan. 
In addition to creating new outreach with underrepresented groups, we plan on gauging current staffer attitude toward newsroom bias and representation through a survey, which we will send out before recruitment for the spring 2022 semester. These results will highlight current newsroom factors that contribute to a lack of inclusive representation and possible steps to remediate these issues, such as mandatory diversity and awareness training for all staffers. 
We also look to enact an effort to analyze internal roadblocks in our newsroom work environment that may contribute to insufficient representation for students with disabilities. We acknowledge newsroom culture can exacerbate stress, especially for students with disabilities, and we understand how this culture may reduce involvement from these students. 
To continue combating this issue, we plan to expand our wellness & outreach coordinator responsibilities and support specific students whose disabilities may compromise their newsroom involvement. As a result, we hope to accommodate students with disabilities appropriately so they feel welcomed and supported at the Daily Trojan. 
Through these efforts, we will continue expanding newsroom perspectives to reflect our commitments to diversity and inclusion.

Warning: This review contains spoilers. 
Directed by Edgar Wright, “Last Night in Soho” closely starts off like the story of every chick flick: A young, eager girl named Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie) moves to the big city — in this case, London — to pursue her dreams of becoming a successful fashion designer. This time, however, the girl can see ghosts. Coupled with Eloise’s mysterious nighttime trips to the 1960s through the life of a young aspiring starlet Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), “Last Night in Soho” is eerie, haunting (literally) and a thrill ride of a story.
It’s fascinating how subversive the narrative is. Just when one might think it’s one of those heartwarming coming-of-age films, the film quickly shows it’s anything but. While on the way to Eloise’s school, for example, what initially seems like a friendly and well-meaning taxi driver begins making offhand sexual remarks about Eloise. As Eloise becomes visibly uncomfortable, the taxi driver hints that he might stalk her. Eloise ends up getting off the cab early and hiding behind a shelf in a local grocery store, peeking to see if the taxi has left. 
At another moment, a romantic encounter between Eloise and her classmate John (Michael Ajao) ends up being one of the most terrifying moments in the film as Eloise simultaneously witnesses a visceral scene of violence from Sandie’s past. There’s a lot of flickering back and forth between the past and the present. As Eloise becomes more invested in Sandie’s narrative, she soon discovers that venturing into the 1960s isn’t only limited to her trips in the nighttime. 
Of course, the darker elements of the film don’t end there. The initial moments of the time travel feel optimistic, like Eloise might have something to learn from Sandie in the quaintness of the past. Eloise dyes her hair blonde just to look like Sandie and, inspired by Sandie’s star quality, begins gaining confidence in herself and her designs. Yet “Last Night in Soho” quickly takes a swerve into murder mystery territory as Eloise suspects Sandie’s manager Jack (Matt Smith) may have been involved in Sandie’s purported violent demise. 
The shine and glamour of Eloise’s first visit quickly dissipates, and she must piece together the truth of what really happened to Sandie – all the while she’s haunted by the ghosts of Sandie’s past, courtesy of Eloise’s special ability. 
When Eloise navigates the city, so does the audience. This connection is done in the most engaging way, where the viewer is looking at the setting just as Eloise is. Soho, as the site of tension, is arguably the most central character. For Eloise, the city is both a source of inspiration and an antagonist. There’s an unnerving life to the truths that emerge about Sandie and Soho. Slowly, the city’s two identities begin to merge just as the lives of Eloise and Sandie do.  
Taylor-Joy is positively charismatic as Sandie, an initially self-assured and unruffled performer swept up in London’s destructive quality. Similarly, Taylor-Joy loses herself and adopts her characters’ grit as she chases a dream that seems so far away. She performs as an entertainer with an emotional complexity that’s difficult to mimic. The fashion is beautiful and mesmerizing, and it’s no surprise that Sandie’s outfits become the inspiration for Eloise’s own designs. McKenzie, too, is compelling as the wide-eyed and uniquely relatable ingénue who doesn’t feel like she belongs with the other girls at her school. Sandie seems like a dreamlike catalyst for Eloise’s self-discovery, but she instead becomes a nightmare. 
The best part about “Last Night in Soho” is the way that these two characters thematically parallel one another: It’s not only ghosts from the past that haunt the present but dreams and deeds. This is rendered stunningly in the frazzled colors, cinematography and editing that all shed light on the two characters’ decline. 
Wright’s use of music is gripping and enchanting all at once, evoking a degree of nostalgia but also foreboding for the narrative (In this regard, Taylor-Joy’s special rendition of the 1964 Petula Clark song “Downtown” for the movie is a major highlight). It’s unfortunate that the film loses those qualities amid the consistent use of shock value that becomes more tiring than thrilling. Many jump scares are used that could be eliminated for the sake of grounding the film in more narrative clarity. 
In that sense, “Last Night in Soho” tries to do a little too much. Near the end, there’s an uninspired montage that feels like the “kill count” of a slasher film. Coupled with Eloise’s attempts to find belonging in fashion school, the supernatural and psychological drama aspects often get tied up in knots and are difficult to unravel. A few logistical gaps aren’t given enough explanation. The storyline about Ellie bearing a social stigma for her family trauma, for example, is briefly mentioned throughout the film but doesn’t really flesh out her character, nor does it illuminate her deterioration throughout the film as much as her preoccupation with Sandie does. 
Still, the film doesn’t disappoint. Watching “Last Night in Soho” is like spending an exciting and brilliant night in the city. Sure it’s sometimes dizzying and disorienting, but you’ll never want it to be your last.

Halloween weekend, as anyone would expect, was jam-packed with spirited events and themed parties throughout Los Angeles to celebrate the holiday that embraces creativity and implores us to be juvenile. For Silent Planet — a new arts collective emerging on campus — it was the perfect time to host its first event. 
After passing the initial white curtain that serves as the entrance to the Alley, the event, which was cleverly titled Monster Alley, was filled with hundreds of people celebrating Halloween who were ready for a rave. Hosted in downtown Los Angeles, Monster Alley was a perfect tap into an underground arts scene at USC and the local area. 
Featuring DJ sets from CZARA, Yesterdayneverhappened, brainb0mbs, ariannbrotherhoood and superwhiteguy9 and music from Crystal Cathedral, the Halloween-inspired rave created a space that felt free and spirited. Similar in genre and atmosphere as other parties such as Subculture Party and Heav3n, Monster Alley was a space for queer people and people of color to celebrate in a space that felt truly inclusive. 
“The type of music itself, like hyperpop, and this kind of music is very different from what would be normally played at USC parties,” said Grace Zhang, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture and American studies and ethnicity and a designer for Silent Planet. “If you see the crowd itself, people are a lot more creative … That’s something we wanted to create — for people to be able to express themselves.”
In comparison to Subculture Party and Heav3n, Monster Alley provided the same environment but was more accessible to USC students, according to Zhang. Helen Hu, a sophomore majoring in computer science who attended the event, said the welcoming space is what drew them to attend. 
“In a place like USC where it’s predominately white, I think it’s great to find spaces that are mostly [filled with] people who are queer, [people] of color,” Hu said. “I think there’s a beauty in that we’re all into the same niche type of interest.” 
Alongside the live music, jewelry-makers Harlot Hands and Fuchsia Peach Rings sold handmade necklaces and rings while tattoo artists @icedwines and @artbyptp offered a flash sheet selection of their work. The event was not only a place for live music and dancing but also allowed artists to share and promote their work — which is Silent Planet’s main intention, according to Durga Arjun, one of the co-founders. 
“What we really want to do is both write about [artists] and then give them a platform through which they can share their work,” said Arjun, a junior majoring in economics, narrative studies and international relations. “We know that we’re able to pull a good audience; we know that the people who we are pulling are people who are interested in this stuff.”
Silent Planet is a central hub for creative talent in the USC area that acts as a canvas to highlight artists’ voices through editorial coverage, networking support and event production. A self-described passion project by co-founders Arjun and Tyler Sinness, a junior majoring in narrative studies, the arts collective focuses on community and collaboration. 
In opposition to mainstream art publications or event companies that, according to Arjun and Sinness, can at times be unwelcoming, Silent Planet’s prioritizes writing about and supporting smaller artists who don’t get covered as often but are still producing professional-level work. 
“It’s important to us that we feature the voices of course that historically do not get the same representation in media,” Sinness said. “The wonderful thing that I saw at Monster Alley, and what I suspected, is that our community is incredibly diverse, incredibly queer and so inclusive of everyone.”
According to Hu, a big part of the reason they enjoyed the event was that it felt authentic in its effort to champion diversity. 
“It’s a platform for queer [people] and [BIPOC] and that’s exactly who it’s run by, and I think it’s great that it’s actually run by people from the communities that it’s reaching out to give a platform to,” Hu said.
In addition to focusing on a diverse pool of talent, Silent Planet is also committed to highlighting an array of artistic mediums rather than focusing on just one, Sinness said. From student film screenings to intimate house shows, the group showcases a variety of work.
What started out as a late-night brainstorm session in January between Arjun and Sinness on their front porch  has quickly grown into an arts community that is founded on the connections they’ve made and the relationships they’ve fostered with creatives on campus. 
“I think putting the Monster Alley event together and being able to put our Instagram page together and seeing the following growth has really shown us that we can build something incredible just based off of the friendships that we’ve made here,” Arjun said. “We value these people, we value their work, we want to see them shine.”
As the Silent Planet team basks in the success that was their launch event, Arjun said they are now focused on recruiting and preparing for the slated release of its editorial magazine next January. Rather than aiming for a specific style or niche, Silent Planet aims to follow the lead of the artists it features instead. 
“I think that the biggest problem that we’ve had with current publications is that it’s a top-down curatorial aesthetic,” Sinness said. “It is one person who is dictating how other artists are going to make the magazine or publication look. Rather, we are trying to base our aesthetic off of quality rather than aesthetic … The whole point of our platform is to feature individuals’ art and to do that we have to be a canvas for creatives, rather than an aesthetic choice.”
Although Monster Alley was a designated success, which was made abundantly clear by attendees at the rave, it is just the beginning for what Silent Planet hopes to accomplish with the community it’s building. 
“We really love that we were able to create that sort of environment where people just felt really free to be able to let go and just be silly for a little bit,” Arjun said. “We want to continue creating spaces where people will just feel good about themselves and feel free to fully express who they are without any type of roadblock in the way.”
