Provost Michael Quick released a memo on Monday detailing issues in the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund that the University plans to solve with its new expansion efforts.

The administration’s most recent action regarding the Topping Fund was the removal of Christina Yokoyama’s position as Topping director, which was effective on Thursday. 
Quick’s memo noted that diversity and inclusion are at the forefront of the University’s values. 
“I am pleased with the direction we’re headed, but I am well aware that there’s more to accomplish,” Quick said in the memo. “We must continue to do what universities do best: discuss, debate and determine the best path forward to reach our goals. 
Quick then shifted his focus to the program. Even though Quick values it as “the genesis of our diversity mission,” he addresses four points that he plans to touch on through restructuring.
Quick found fault in the program’s allocation of funds. According to Quick, an average of more than a third of the program’s account were not used at all, and the cost to run the program is “many times greater per student than other important programs and services.”
Additionally, while there are 7,200 undergraduate and 9,600 graduate students who are eligible for the program, only 115 are current Topping scholars, Quick said.
“That does not seem right, at a time when there is so much financial need,” Quick said in the memo. “With all the available funds, that does not seem equitable.”
Quick said that by expanding the Topping Fund, the University plans to include more than five graduate students in the program, since “the original intent of the Topping Fund calls for between a third and a half of the scholars to be comprised of graduate students.”
In response to the memo, Topping Governing Board scholarship representative Yaneiry Barrios said that these changes can potentially lessen the quality of the program by being less exclusive.
“They make it seem like it’s so easy to get Topping, [but] it’s not just about being first-generation, being low-income, it’s also about going after a community … providing assistance, being aware of surroundings, not just like an application,” Barrios said.
Topping Governing Board Chair Sierra Williams said that the memo falsely assumed the scholars were against the idea of expansion of the Topping Fund and believes that the University is at fault for the way it is handling the program’s restructuring.
“I just think that they’re so stuck in their decision that they don’t want to change anything, but … no one’s against increasing [the Fund],” Williams said. “We’re against … how [they] want to go about the way of doing this.”
According to Williams, the Topping Fund’s charter specifically states that only five graduate students could be involved in the program at a time to ensure that they will act as mentors to undergraduate scholars. 
“The fellowship is marketed as an undergraduate program … so that was its original focus and the graduate students are more so there to be like mentors for the students,” Williams said. “I don’t know where the numbers came from. It was three, but I think two to three years ago, they increased to five.”
In the memo, Quick referred to the Topping scholars’ “Call to Action” meeting at the Radisson Ballroom on Jan. 9. At the meeting, scholars, Yokoyama and faculty members further discussed Yokoyama’s elimination. Quick stated his disapproval of the scholars using money from the program to rent the room.
“While I respect the right of our scholars to disagree with decisions, I do not believe this is a legitimate use of Topping money,” Quick said in the memo. “I will look further into this allegation, and if substantiated, I will reimburse the Fund using other resources.”
 Williams said that due to the urgency in addressing the Provost’s changes, the location of the meeting was planned last-minute, and the scholars quickly paid its rental fee. 
“Because it was a Topping event, and at the time, we needed the permission of the director … so it’s not like going against anything,” Williams said. “It was just … we needed a place to do it, and the Radisson was the only room available on a Tuesday night. It wasn’t like, ‘We’re going to pay so much for this room because we want to,’ but it was the only one available for the day.” 
Williams and Topping scholar Sabrina Enriquez, who is working to potentially have the Topping Fund established in the Division of Student Affairs, will be meeting with Quick on Thursday to further discuss future changes to the program.

Trojan Advocates for Political Progress hosted a forum for Undergraduate Student Government senate candidates Monday. 
The 10 USG senate candidates who attended the forum spoke about implementing student resources, increasing communication between Greek organizations and USG and health care costs. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
Ten of the 15 senatorial candidates attended and discussed issues ranging from USG and administration’s relationship with Greek life to welcoming spring admits and transfer students to campus.
Senate candidate Shayan Kohanteb emphasized the importance of USG supporting Greek organizations, one of his major platform ideas. 
“The IFC [Interfraternity Council] said that USG has never even had a role in anything they’ve ever done,” Kohanteb said. “USG needs to step up and maybe add a representative that goes to the interfraternity council or panhellenic council [meetings].”
Senate candidate Amy Chong said her experience as a transfer student informed her candidacy and agenda.
“When I stepped on campus, the feeling I felt was neglection and isolation,” Chong said. “Students should not feel that way when they’re on campus, especially at a university they worked so hard to get into.”
Senate candidates Max Geschwind, Michaela Murphy and Will Sherman also spoke about making campus more welcoming for transfer students and spring admits.
Murphy noted that she wanted to address accessibility to health-related aid on campus. 
“We need student health transparency and we need full-cost coverage for STI, STD, and HIV screenings on our campus for students both on and off USC health insurance,” she said.
Senatorial candidate Gabriel Savage said all of the positions in the USG Senate will be filled by newcomers.
“We are at risk of losing a year’s worth progress on initiatives,” he said. ”People here right now who are senate aides, who are close to people in the legislative branch, they are your best chance for continuity in your student government.”
Senate candidate Meagan Lane emphasized her ability to be diplomatic and cater to diverse perspectives as a useful quality for an incoming senator.
Senate candidate Neal Sivadas argued for more partnerships with organizations and local retailers in order to provide students with discounts both on-and-off campus.
Senate candidate Andre Luna pitched the addition of a newsletter  for first-generation college students in order to inform them of the resources available at USC.
Senate candidate Cody Ela explained his proposal for the implementation of contraceptive machines in all dormitories, which he said would be subsidized by USG. He argued that this would make these resources more accessible and conspicuous to students.
Annenberg Media will be hosting the final presidential forum, the “Inclusion Town Hall,” on Tuesday at 7:45 p.m. in Wallis Annenberg Hall.

USC researchers recently discovered a cellular mechanism that accounts for at least 10 percent of each amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia cases. 
The gene mutation in the C9 gene increases the risk of ALS and frontotemporal dementia cases. Photo from USC Keck School of Medicine News Release.
The mechanism limits the number of “cellular janitors,” like lysosomes, in the nervous system leading to increased risk for the two neurodegenerative diseases.
Yingxiao Shi and Shaoyu Sebastian of the Justin Ichida Laboratory at USC said that a mutation in a gene labeled “C9ORF72” leads to toxicity in nerve cells, which is a factor in at least 10 percent of both ALS and frontotemporal diseases.
The C9ORF72, or C9 gene, produces a protein required to make lysosomes that grab and remove toxic proteins and garbage, according to Ichida, an assistant professor of stem cell and regenerative medicine at the Keck School of Medicine. It acts as a cellular chain reaction. Without a normal number of lysosomes, the motor nerve cells collect toxic garbage, which includes a large toxic protein produced by the C9 mutation and molecules that receive signals from the glutamate and die.
“We figured out how the most common form of ALS causes nerve cell death, and nerve cell death is what causes patients to become paralyzed or lose control of neuromuscular functions,” Ichida said in a news release from Keck.
To understand the process, the researchers removed blood from ALS patients carrying the C9 mutation and reprogrammed these blood cells into motor nerve cells that degenerate and die in the disease, according to the news release. In addition, they extracted blood from healthy patients, reprogrammed these blood cells into motor nerve cells and used gene editing to delete the C9 gene, according to the news release.
Both groups with the mutated motor nerve cells had a reduced number of proteins normally made by the C9 gene. By adding the supplemental C9 protein, the researchers were able to stop the motor nerve cells from degenerating.
The Ichida Lab is now using the patient-derived motor nerve cells to test potential drugs, focusing on those that affect lysosomes. They are looking to find potential drugs that slow or stop degeneration of these motor nerve cells, and hope to eventually use these drugs on patients, according to the news release.

The official transcript of last week’s hearing regarding allegations brought against the Mai & Brianna presidential ticket was updated Monday with previously excluded portions of the transcript. The updated transcript now includes a closing statement from the Mai & Brianna ticket as well as elevated dialogue between the two tickets.
The new transcript shows that of the comments made by the Mai & Brianna ticket, approximately 50 percent of their comments were either partially or fully excluded. For the  Debbie & Blake campaign members, approximately 25 percent of their comments were partially or fully excluded. Some comments made by the Elections Commission, including those made by Nillani Anandakugan, Proxy Chair of the Elections Commission, were also partially or fully excluded.
Both Debbie Lee and Mai Mizuno, the two presidential candidates, told the Daily Trojan that they were not officially notified by the Undergraduate Student Government of the update to the transcript. Addison Adkins, Mai & Brianna’s campaign manager, however, said that she was notified of the changes directly.
Neither the USG Elections and Recruitment Team nor USG’s Director of Communications responded to repeated requests for comment.
“USG realizes that some dialogue from this hearing was missing and have since updated this hearing transcript for full transparency,” USG’s statement above the updated transcript said. “We strive to ensure full transparency and apologize for the issue.”
Lee said that she had not noticed any inconsistencies in the original transcript but was “relieved to find the information intact.”
“We understood that transcripts could be modified during any point but weren’t explicitly notified about the specific changes made to the transcript,” Lee said.
Adkins said it was important that the updates were made to the transcript, including the inclusion of a closing statement from Adkins regarding not recommending sanctions against the Debbie & Blake ticket.
“I don’t think we need to recommend any sanctions,” Adkins said at the hearing, according to the updated transcript. “They’re just trying to do what’s best for their campaign just like we’re trying to do what’s best for ours.”
Mizuno said that this statement from Adkins was something that her campaign wanted to emphasize.
“We’re really happy to have the transcripts reflect the sentiments that we expressed at the end of the hearing,” Mizuno said.
The verdict of last Monday’s hearing had found that “no infraction occurred” with the Mai & Brianna ticket.
After the publication of the verdict Wednesday, the Daily Trojan requested an official transcript copy of the Jan. 29 hearing, but was denied. USG released a statement and the first transcript of the hearing the following day.
According to the Elections Code XIII.D, “a written copy of the transcript will be released to both the general public and the press.”
USG’s statement Thursday also said that the Elections Code required that the transcript be made available within “the 24-hour window,” but no such time frame is listed in the Elections Code. Instead, the code states that “the transcript shall be available in the USG office for public consumption as soon as a verdict is reached.”
The USG statement had attributed the transcript’s delay to “unforeseen circumstances and technical difficulties” and said that the team is “ardently working on developing a more efficient method of releasing future hearing transcripts.”

Arya Roshanian | Daily Trojan
I always hear music inside my head. I know that sounds strange, and I promise I don’t mean it in an uneasy, schizophrenic sort of way. Sometimes the music is mild, like I have a metronome inside my head and my footsteps are the beat, or my hands typing on the keyboard strings together a harmony with the sounds of chatter from bystanders. 
Other times, it’s much more severe, as if there is literally a radio inside my head that refuses to turn off. I can sometimes feel distinct melodies floating throughout my mind. I also find that in times of crisis, when I’m most sad or even uncomfortable, the music is at its loudest, as if to tune out the real world around me. But I don’t discourage the music. In fact, I find that it’s the only thing keeping me sane in this garbage dump that my days have become.
The last time the music was at its loudest was on Friday. Before that, I can’t remember it ever being that loud. It completely consumed me. 
Since starting graduate school, I’ve had to make sacrifices in order to balance the daunting task of working 40 hours a week in tandem with being a full-time student. For someone who used to go out every weekend, the adjustment has been surprisingly smooth. But I’d been feeling antsy for that entire week and needed a night on the town and to destroy a few brain cells to restore my sanity. So I decided to set time aside to hit the town. I had deserved it — but soon I found out that my mind disagreed.
My intended goal  was to rage into the wee hours of the morning. My boyfriend Matt and I planned to meet friends at Eagle L.A. around 10 p.m. and go from there. We arrived to a small crowd that eventually tripled in less than an hour. Our friends met us one by one and everything started out pleasant. And overall, it was. 
But that’s about as much information as I can relay, because I can’t recall a single thing about what happened at the bar or what I even talked about with my friends. I don’t know if I was just tired from the long work day or if subconsciously I was unhappy with the company, but I completely checked out mentally. As I watched new and old friends converse and laugh together, I stood against a wall, expressionless, living inside my internal dialogue. And for the entire hour and 45 minutes I was at the bar, I was in the world of Bernstein’s Candide. 
Candide, which alongside West Side Story is known as one of Leonard Bernstein’s most popular work, is currently on-stage at L.A. Opera (which also troubles me, considering I work for the company and seem to be carrying the burden of my job at all times). 
Art by Grace Cillo | Daily Trojan
Though the opera’s acclaim has been mixed since its 1956 premiere, the slapstick farce that makes light of traumatic events seems to be a commercial success today, primarily — I believe — because of its music. And it’s that same music that served as my mind’s playlist on Friday night. I heard “Glitter and Be Gay,” the opera’s best-known aria, over and over and over again. 
This fiery showstopper is not only a toe-tapper, but the lyrics are much grittier than what the light melody suggests. It is sung by the character Cunegonde, who has lived twice as many lives as the average person. As the daughter of a baron, she grew up insanely wealthy. Incidentally, being both rich and beautiful, no one ever expected much of her, other than to cater to the male gaze. After her life is turned upside down following the the eruption of war, she is raped repeatedly and sold to different men (did I mention that Candide is supposed to be a comic operetta?). She is eventually given an ample supply of jewels to appease her condition. 
“Glitter and Be Gay” is an aria that I’ve known for years. I’ve heard it performed by a multitude of sopranos, both bad and good. However, it was only very recently that I watched the operetta in its entirety and listened to the aria in context of the show. And it’s really depressing. 
I understand that in the 18th century, the standards women were held to are different than they are now (arguably, not by much, but there is still a difference). But to the men who bought Cunegonde for a small sum and then drowned her in rubies and sapphires: What difference would that have on her psyche? Cunegonde may be painted as unintelligent, but she’s much smarter than she lets on. She knows your tricks. Her complicity is a sham. She’s taking your jewels while plotting your demise.
These are the lighthearted thoughts that devoured my mind on Friday night.
My intended all-nighter of partying ended before midnight, because I simply couldn’t stand to be out-and-about any longer. Perhaps this is a sign that I’m beginning to favor my thoughts over physical company. Or maybe it was the three bowls I smoked before heading to the club. 
You know what, now that I think about it, it definitely was. But for the sake of romanticizing my experience, let’s just assume there is a phantom reason to my mental coma. Maybe I’ve outgrown the bar scene. I’m too socially anxious for it, anyways. But at least I know that if I’m forced to go out again, I’ll have my mind as company.

When Justin Timberlake announced his new album Man of the Woods would be inspired by his roots and his family, fans and critics were immediately skeptical. What would a country album from the singer of “Sexy Back” sound like? The album’s announcement seemed to indicate a more acoustic, Southern sound, but it was followed up with the heavy, electronic lead single “Filthy.”
The song was shocking in that it was vastly different from what Timberlake had originally advertised the album to be. “Filthy,” like a lot of the pop singer’s past efforts, takes a while to get used to. It doesn’t live up to Timberlake’s past efforts like “Suit and Tie.” 
In fact, the entire album has moments reminiscent of Timberlake’s past greatness, but it never comes close to the previous heights reached in the singer’s career. He attempts to blend folk and Americana with the R&B-infused dance pop that made him famous. He tries his hand at a deeper, more meaningful project, but  is ultimately too ambitious.
The mixture of sounds comes close to working on tracks like “Sauce,” “Higher Higher,” “Wave” and “Say Something,” but completely misses the mark on others like “Morning Light,” “Flannel” and “Midnight Summer Jam.”
Justin Timberlake’s fifth studio album ‘Man of the Woods’ is trite and thematically disjointed. Photo courtesy of RCA Record.
The album finds Timberlake desperately attempting to evolve and produce something fresh and new. His efforts are commendable, but the amalgamation of genres ultimately does not work to his benefit. The record often comes across as cheesy, with songs like the laughable “Flannel” and uninspired “Morning Light” featuring banal lyrics like “In the whole world of guys, I must be the luckiest alive.” The cliches continue with Timberlake’s wife Jessica Biel attempting to add artistic depth with spoken word sprinkled within tracks like “Hers (Interlude).” Finally, Timberlake follows in the footsteps of Beyoncé and Adele by closing the album with a dedication to his son Silas, whose name actually means “man of the forest.” It’s a well-composed track, but it feels unoriginal when compared to the similar tracks released by the aforementioned pop stars.
The best moments on the record lie in the strong vocal performance, and the intriguing but inconsistent sonics. The lyrics are never deep, but some of the songs benefit from a bold production. “Filthy” and “Supplies,” while completely out of place relative to the rest of the album, offer danceable beats, and standouts “Montana” and “Breeze Off the Pond” finally deliver the signature Timberlake sound that made the singer famous. 
Man of the Woods is overall a drastic change from the discography of the former *NSYNC member. Timberlake took several risks and hit the mark with a few songs. He even offers up some meaningful things to say, preaching confidence and self-assuredness, but he tries to do too much. In trying to do it all, the pop star sacrifices what could have been intriguing and new for under-whelming, recycled sounds.

#OscarsSoWhite. #MeToo. #TimesUp. 
Anyone who has an Instagram, Twitter or Facebook account should recognize these hashtags and the movements they represent. In recent years, as the smartphone has risen in popularity, so has social media activism. And as angry, politically-charged posts continue to flood our timelines, one may ask the question: Do hashtags work? 
The television producer — and political activist in her own right — Shonda Rhimes says no. At Dartmouth College’s 2014 commencement, Rhimes ended her speech with the comment “Hashtags are very pretty on Twitter. But a hashtag is not a movement. A hashtag does not make you Dr. King. A hashtag does not change anything. It’s a hashtag. It’s you, sitting on your butt, typing on your computer and then going back to binge-watching your favorite show.” In a sense, Rhimes is correct. 
A simple hashtag on social media will not change the world. It will not change preconceived notions of racism, nor will it change the misogynistic attitudes that form the foundation of our nation’s rape culture. If people want to create tangible change — particularly in the realm of public policy — they cannot demand it from their couches. That much is true. 
But, of course, that all depends on the goals of the movement. For instance, if people actually wanted to change gun control legislation, perhaps they should utilize more resources than the apps on their phone. But in the case of #MeToo, the objective of the campaign is to simply raise awareness of sexual assault cases and create some solidarity among victims. But the campaign far exceeded expectations: Acting as a story-advancing mechanism, it kept the subject of sexual assault relevant in public discourse, encouraging more women to share their stories and allowing more journalists to uncover the truth about once-respected public figures. 
Furthermore, the advent of social media activism dramatically increases opportunities for people to make their voices heard. It is logical to assume that a political bystander may not participate in a protest after watching one broadcast on the evening news. But if people see their friends sharing content, they may be more likely to click on the retweeted article and share it themselves. Perhaps after reading the content on their timelines, they decide to further research the issue and maybe even find some way to become politically engaged. Not the most likely case, but at least they’ll be more educated on the issue. 
College students in particular play a crucial role in this type of activism: Millennials dominate social media both in terms of user numbers and tech-savviness. Virtual protests put on by this age group can go viral in minutes, dramatically facilitating the process by which words can turn into action. For example, in 2015, waves of social media activism at the University of Missouri in response to the rise of the Black Lives Matter forced the university’s president and chancellor to resign — and spread to over 100 universities and colleges within weeks. 
At USC, the most recent social media demonstration against administration concerned the removal of the Director of the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, Christina Yokoyama. And although there was no viral hashtag to dramatically take down University officials, the simple act of sharing of an article on Facebook could make students more aware of an important change to their school’s administration.
Maybe that’s all we need sometimes. In its entirety, the concept of social media activism is what people make of it. Sometimes a particularly viral issue can influence change, and sometimes a hashtag can act as a simple supplement to the fight against a larger political issue. In the end, sharing content or using a hashtag cannot cause any harm to political progress. But to truly become a political activist, to truly create a movement, one’s best bet is to get off the couch and actually move.

Last week, The New York Times published an in-depth, investigative piece titled “The Follower Factory.” The story followed the virtual black market of fake followers on social media, bought by companies, organizations, public figures and even journalists. 
Buying followers, to many familiar with internet culture, is not a new phenomenon; however, the story revealed frightening details about the large number of bots that exist across the digital ecosystem — specifically, how easily they can be bought and how, in the wrong hands, they can be utilized to spread false and divisive content across platforms. 
Twitter’s numbers were the most surprising, as the Times reported about 15 percent (or 48 million) of Twitter’s active users could be automated accounts, simulating the interactions and identities of real people. Despite these projected numbers, the platform has failed to systematically combat these bot networks and the shadow companies behind them. 
Yet, a larger concern looms behind this topic. The Times’ piece also lists the names of media personnel who bought their online followings. The list varies from a media columnist at The Hill to correspondents at E! News and CBS to an Infowars reporter. Most notably, Chicago Sun-Times’ film critic Richard Roeper was put on leave without detailed explanation, as the paper announced an investigation into his social media activity.
But in Washington Post reporter Paul Farhi’s response to Roeper’s leave, Farhi reports how many news organizations, from NPR to the Times, do not have explicit social media policies against purchasing followers, mainly because the topic has never had to be addressed before. 
Since Roeper identifies as a film critic and not as a reporter, his role at the Sun-Times is slightly different. His writing consists more of opinions and commentary; therefore, Farhi interprets Roeper’s fake followers as an ego boost instead of a deceptive action.

Yet, the inflation of a journalist’s follower count to increase social perception of one’s influence and trustworthiness in the trade can be construed as deceptive. Journalists are bound by their ethics to the sources they report on and the audiences they inform. 
Credibility, transparency, and honesty are a few of the traits that journalists — at every age and stage in their career — should strive to embody, especially in an era in which the news media is constantly being questioned for its veracity. Purchasing large numbers of automated followers creates a false narrative about a journalist’s career and can alter perceptions of the influence of their writing or online presence.
Social media has undeniably altered audience engagement and growth for media organizations, and along with that shift, journalists’ personal identities and their voices have become both increasingly amplified and scrutinized. Besides the scrutiny, however, many journalists have adopted masses of dedicated followings, boosting them to the status of online fame. 
Vox editor-at-large Ezra Klein and The New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman are just two examples of the well-known journalists with hundreds of thousands — or, in Klein’s case, millions — of followers, which affirm their informational credibility and influence.
The bot phenomenon, however, is not just restricted to journalists. Many artists, politicians and entrepreneurs have capitalized on this commodified fame, allowing them to expand their agenda and appear more influential than they claim to be.
For online influencers who are being paid to promote products, these actions could be found fraudulent by the companies paying them. But for those seeking to increase social capital for the growth of their careers or businesses, bots still fall into a legal gray area that remains undisputed.
