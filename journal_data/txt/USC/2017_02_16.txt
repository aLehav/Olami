President C. L. Max Nikias delivered his State of the University address to the public on Thursday at Bovard Auditorium. Nikias spoke about inclusivity in the current political climate, the University Village and the Campaign for USC.
“Being a member of the USC community for the past 25 years has been one of the greatest joys of my life,” Nikias said. “I have always admired our community’s competitiveness and ambition, creativity and foresight, collaborative spirit and commitment to the most sacred values of the academy, which are ancient yet forever youthful.”
American universities, he said, have been a magnet for people from all continents because diversity, inclusion and innovation have defined their character for generations. 
In the light of President Donald Trump’s travel ban, Nikias brought up the issue of two American values coming into conflict — national security and the openness of the United States to the outside world. Even though he emphasized the importance of safety, he remained unwavering in the University’s support for immigrants.
“We honor efforts to keep our nation safe,” Nikias said. “However, we will champion the inclusiveness and openness that set our nation and its top universities apart.”
Nikias said he believed USC was founded with a commitment to international diversity, nourishing greatness through the rich exchange of ideas, spanning a limitless range of nationalities and religions.
“If we lose the inclusive spirit, my fellow Trojans, we lose our souls,” Nikias said.
Due to USC’s academic scope and breadth, independence as a private university, history of public service and vigorous entrepreneurial spirit, Nikias expressed his desire for USC to shape this century.
He went on to say that faculty are the foundation of all academic excellence and expressed his condolences about the passing of Professor Bosco Tjan.
“We honor him by celebrating his example as a scholar and as a person, and we are also seriously addressing the faculty-student relationships for the well-being of our entire USC community,” Nikias said.
One of these opportunities for enhancing student life is the University Village, Nikias said, calling it an elite residential academic environment, housing 2600 students and composed of eight colleges with their own flags and symbols, giving rise to powerful new student life and traditions.
“Make no mistake about it, my fellow Trojans,” Nikias said. “The Village will be the envy of American higher education.”
With an eye toward the future, Nikias mentioned that the University has an obligation to steer students to career placement opportunities. While the Trojan family is a powerful network, Nikias said, more investments in student job placement are necessary, especially since the career landscape changes rapidly. 
He announced that the University will begin fundraising for the construction of a new hospital on the Health Sciences Campus. It will include the expansion of operating rooms, intensive care units and cancer patient programs. According to Nikias, the state-of-the-art facility will reflect the needs of the future as far as revolutionary technology.
“It will make a statement that we are the destination to treat very sick patients,” Nikias said.
Another area where USC has excelled is its presence and initiative in Los Angeles, Nikias said.
“Not only are we the largest private employer in the city of Los Angeles, but also USC’s economic impact on this region is $8 billion annually,” Nikias said.
Nikias said that the Campaign for USC, the initiative to raise $6 billion, will be completed 18 months ahead of schedule. Due to its success, Nikias announced that the University will be extending its campaign for five more years.
He emphasized that academic investment remains crucial and key to making new friends, while promoting USC’s academic initiatives.
“My wife Niki and I are as excited as ever by the challenge, because we know it will bring our university to its ultimate, final and glorious destination,” Nikias said. “My fellow Trojans: Let us always, always remember that our dreams do have a deadline. Therefore, urgently … let us continue gathering resources to make them a reality.”
Nikias acknowledged that while USC has made great progress, the challenge is far from over.
“My fellow Trojans, I honestly believe we are exactly at that moment of our academic ascent,” Nikias said. “We have caught our own glimpse of an ocean of grand possibilities, the promise of a brighter future as an undisputedly elite academic institution. Let us therefore go forward with passion, with confidence and determination. And let us transform the promise into a magnificent reality.”
Sadly, Trump’s contentious issue is yet one more that makes being an international student difficult, on top of our already complex culture and language. Assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on their life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   An award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.    
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who have the loudest voice!

Undergraduate suites in the University Village Housing buildings have filled up, a few days into the housing assignment selection period. 
Construction on the USC Village began in 2014 and will be completed in Fall 2017. The $700 million project will include a new residential college — the McCarthy Honors College — for freshmen and four buildings for undergraduate housing. Some students cite the excitement around the USC Village as the reason they applied to live there in the fall. 
“The University was hyping the Village up so much and making it seem like a big deal,” said Sophia Comeau, a freshman majoring in journalism. “They made it seem like you should want to live in the village.” 
Returning undergraduates who want to live in university housing must participate in the general lottery. After submitting an online application, these students are given a selection time through a random lottery. 
According to Director of Housing Keenan Cheung, bed spaces in the USC Village buildings filled up by the end of Tuesday. While Cheung says USC Housing anticipated the high level of demand, many students didn’t. Eden Roehr, a freshman majoring in law, history and culture, signed a contract with her friends for a loft in USC Village Building No. 9. 
“We wanted a two-bedroom, four-person room. We also would have been happy with a six-man or a five-man, but all that was left were lofts,” Roehr said. “Now we’re debating if we want to keep our spot in the village.”
Students have voiced that the current selection system is flawed. Individuals with earlier selection times can secure a suite not only for themselves but also for their roommates, regardless of when their roommates’ selection times occur. Cheung maintains that the current system is the best way to assign housing. 
“Nothing changed with our processes with the addition of the village,” Cheung said. “Being that our lottery system is assigned completely by random, we believe it is the fairest way and gives any person that wants to live together a better chance.”
Some students believe there are ways to reform the selection system for the future, including limiting the number of roommates an individual can reserve bed spaces for, or opening a limited number of spots for each building a day — like how class registration is set up — so that students who have much later selection times still have a chance at getting the option they want. 
Eager for a chance to live in USC Village, some students have posted in the “University of Southern California Class of 2020” Facebook page, offering money for a bed space in a suite, or to swap suites. 
Sam Hardy, a freshman majoring in psychology, will be living in a two-bedroom, four-person suite in USC Village Building No. 6 and feels fortunate that one of her roommates was able to select housing at 8:30 a.m. on Monday. She says that she’s noticed tension among her peers. 
“It’s cutthroat,” Hardy said. “You don’t want to promote that you got it because people are so angry about not getting it.” 
Really disappointed in USC this time. The freshman and sophomores are going to be here for 2 or 3 more years. Meanwhile, the juniors who are going to be seniors never even had a chance to live here for their last school year. I really wanted to live here for my last school year. I just don’t understand why USC didn’t think this one through.

When Shaun Harper was young, you wouldn’t find him outside playing soccer with the other boys. He would be inside, playing school.
“I would always have to play the teacher,” Harper said. “My bedroom wall was my chalkboard.”
Harper is the founder of the new USC Race and Equity Center, where he will work with faculty from USC’s academic schools to solve racial problems inside and outside of the classroom. The center opens in July.
Harper returns to USC after 10 years at the University of Pennsylvania, where he led the Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education. Harper was an assistant professor of clinical education at USC from 2003-2005.
Having grown up in Thomasville, Ga., Harper is no stranger to racial discrimination. According to Harper, racial politics run so deep in the town that the high school he attended still has two homecoming queens each year, one black and one white.
“I know it sounds like I grew up in the ’50s, but we’re talking about the ’70s and ’80s,” Harper said. “I noticed very early on that most of the black people were poor, and most of the white people were rich. They were in charge of things, and they owned things and they seemed to have lots of power and authority. My people, not so much. It became an intellectual question for me as a kid. I was like this kid, young social scientist, wondering, ‘Why are things so unequal?’”
According to Harper, it was his personal experiences of discrimination that propelled him to pursue a career in education.
“I remember walking to school one day,” Harper said. “I cut across the grass of someone’s lawn, and a white woman came out, and she said, ‘I don’t like n—— on my grass.’ You know, that was very mean to say to a kid, right. But at least I knew where I stood. In corporations, and sometimes in higher education, and in other workplace settings, people don’t want n—— on their grass, or on their staffs or in their executive suite, but they’ll never say it. They’ll just find all sorts of ways to keep us out of those places.”
Harper enrolled at Albany State University, a historically black university, as an education major. While serving on the search committee in charge of finding the university’s new president, Harper realized he wanted a future working in higher education.
“I remember being so impressed by these black people,” Harper said. “They were scholars, leaders. I was like, ‘Oh, wow, I want to be like this.’”
Harper recalls how the professors knew how to make their students succeed, as, according to Harper, over 50 percent of African Americans with doctoral degrees completed their undergraduate years at historically black universities.
Harper wants to bring that feeling of community to all colleges and find a way to help black students perform better in their studies. He believes that when tackling issues regarding diversity in education, an interdisciplinary approach is often the most effective.
“I cannot effectively understand, nor respond to racial inequities in education without also understanding how poverty intersects with race [and] how access to high quality healthcare affects students’ educational outcome,” Harper said.
According to Harper, tackling a problem like racism requires dedication and commitment.
“It’s really important to be disciplined,” Harper said. “If you’re going to be a scholar, you have to pick a problem, and you have to stick to it.”
At  the University of Pennsylvania, Harper worked to unite diversity-minded professors from all areas of the school in common conversation. Harper wants to bring this same approach to the USC Race and Equity Center.
“My vision for the USC Race and Equity Center is that the most important conversations about race will be had here,” Harper said. “Through conferences, through speaker series, through digital products, I want USC to be the place that people know they can turn to for expert analysis, for deep thinking and for solutions.”
This is very exciting news! Proud alum here!

From Feb. 22 to 26, the USC Shinso Ito Center for Japanese Religions and Culture will host the third Hapa Japanese Festival. Hapa refers to a person who is partially Asian or Pacific Islander and the event focuses on celebrating the mixed roots and mixed cultures of Japanese people.
“Roughly 40 percent of the community is mixed race and by the time of the next Census in 2020, Japanese Americans will be the first Asian American group to be majority multiracial,” said associate professor Duncan Williams, the director of CJRC and the founder of the Hapa Japan Project.
The first Hapa Japanese Festival first took place in San Francisco in 2001 and attracted about 1,000 people. By the second one in 2004, the number of participants quadrupled. This is be the first time that USC will host this event.
“The goal of the festival is to showcase through music, food, film and academic presentations the contributions of mixed-race Japanese people,” he said.
The festival includes a myriad of cultural activities and is also the site of the three-day Critical Mixed Studies Conference. The conference will include talks from some of the most esteemed Hapa thinkers including Yasuko Takezawa of Kyoto University and Paul Spickard of UC Santa Barbara. Beyond the academic conference, there will be hapa film screenings, panels, jam sessions, interviews and live performances.
Isabelle Nazha | Daily Trojan
The theme of this year’s event is “trans,” which encompases issues regarding transgender, trangressions, transmigrations and the struggles of being transracial. The festival will bring up very important discussions regarding the “mixed face” and different perspectives on beauty, being an Japanese American during World War II, mixed race identities and Hapa queer and transgender art. The festival will start conversations about the many different kinds of Hapa individuals and their histories.
One of the most anticipated events of the festival is a performance by Kina Grannis, a USC alumna and winner of the the Doritos Crash the Super Bowl Contest where she received a contract with Interscope Records. Grannis attended USC from 2003-2007, and though she graduated with a degree in psychology, she recorded her first EP at the Thornton School of Music.
“USC was really where I got to try out what it meant to be an artist for the first time,” she said. “I had started writing music in high school, but my time at USC was when I started playing shows for the first time, delved even deeper into songwriting and my identity of being a songwriter.”
Gannis is also a hapa individual who has embraced her multiculturality.
“I liked that I could identify with multiple cultures. I liked that we took our shoes off at home, ate sushi, used words like ‘ohashi and ‘shoyu’ around the house,” Grannis said. “I also liked knowing that I had ancestors from England and Ireland and France, and ancestors that traveled to America generations and generations ago.”
Grannis mentioned how her rich heritage influenced her music. Her philosophies resound those of the festival — to celebrate one’s history and connect with those who share it.
“[Being hapa] made me feel more connected to everyone, as opposed to feeling like I belonged strictly to one particular group, and I think that’s something that has really influenced my music,” she said. “When I write songs, my goal is to connect to as many people as possible — to make people feel less alone in the experience of being alive and being a human.”
The Hapa Japanese Festival will commence next Wednesday and run until Sunday. Gannis will perform along with Marié Digby, Kris Roch and Andy Suzuki & The Method on Saturday at 7 p.m. at Bovard Auditorium. The festival and concert are free to USC students.

On what was otherwise a normal Wednesday afternoon, students noticed something out of the ordinary sold by a campus vendor on Trousdale Parkway. According to reports from the Daily Trojan, the booth sold T-shirts and albums with the swastika symbol.
The booth set off debates between nearby students. Many found the presence of the products on campus to be a disturbing representation of the most grotesque genocide in human history. Others defended the vendor, citing his actions to be well within his freedom of speech rights. 
We won’t discount the purported historical origins of the symbol, which the vendor said he wanted to reclaim. But we will address the meaning of free speech on our campus and how to exercise that right responsibly. 
As members of the press corps, our first instinct as student journalists is to defend the first amendment, as it is a pillar of the field in which we tirelessly work. Any form of punishment as a result of someone speaking their mind is, quite frankly, censorship.
Incidents such as the appearance of the swastika on our campus, however, are more than just a “difference of opinion.” What was more concerning was that the vendor reportedly brushed off concerns, telling a student she should grow “tough skin.” This symbol, however, is not something people can dust off and simply walk away from.
The swastika has been marred by a history of hatred. It represents the death of more than 6 million innocent people during the Holocaust and was recognized by the Anti-Defamation League as a hate symbol in 2010. 
On a college campus, students’ understanding of the swastika has been shaped by years of learning about the Holocaust. We are taught from our pre-college education that the swastika is an emblem of evil. 
And it hits close to home — the majority of those witnessing the event were deeply disturbed by the presence of the swastika on campus. For some students, the symbol represents not only a heinous crime on humanity but also the death of family members. The vendor’s actions were grossly offensive.
Members and contributors to the USC community have a right to free speech, but provocative statements should not be made for the sake of being provocative. They should be the products of thoughtful discussion. Perhaps there is some merit in a conversation about whether the swastika can ever be reclaimed, but to begin this discussion by selling swastika T-shirts only serves to offend and shock students rather than promote a productive dialogue.
Offensive iconography is not conducive to a productive campus environment and only breeds more hatred. Instead, it validates other forms of hatred and makes respect expendable.
Over the past few months, the energy of the Trump administration has employed and empowered anti-Semitic individuals and incited a wave of Holocaust denial and Nazi sympathizers. So when a vendor on campus sells swastika T-shirts, even if we are to assume that he did so to reclaim the symbol, the message that bystanders receive is not of redemption but of anti-Semitism. And the reaction is justifiable shock.
We as a community are at a time in our national consciousness in which we are increasingly susceptible to incendiary provocateurs whose actions carry grave consequences. Firebrands like Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller thrive off of the attention from intentionally inflammatory anti-Semitic statements. It is this context which makes a vendor’s decision to sell swastika T-shirts under the guise of a thoughtful academic reclamation even more irresponsible. Anti-Semitism is alive and well, and we must protect our campus from it.
Here at USC, the community spirit of the Trojan Family is boundless. At football games, we hug strangers seated next to us when our team scores a touchdown. There’s a sense of shared pride when fellow Trojans collect accolades under the University’s name. This will all collapse if we fail to speak and act in ways that stand up for our fellow Trojans. And that means decrying anti-Semitism and ensuring responsible free speech on campus.
Daily Trojan Spring 2017 Editorial Board
Lol. This campus newspaper is trash. Used to be decent few years ago though
The free speech test consists of tolerating – not accepting – any expression that offends you.  It is not an easy task.  Unfortunately, people on the Left define free speech as any expression they agree with. All other expressions are objectionable and usually labeled “Fascistic”.

In its recent parody of the creepy ‘80s thriller Fatal Attraction, Saturday Night Live has perhaps reached the pinnacle of its political commentary.
Nearly four minutes long, the skit is carefully filmed and edited, previously recorded and hosts a cast of criticisms as Conway hassles CNN correspondent Jake Tapper for airtime. The skit lays bare everything from Conway’s transparent willingness to pathologically lie (“You made up a massacre,” Bennett’s Tapper stammers) to her desperation for airtime (“Is this the tie you wore on the news today?” — Conway grabs his jacket lapels and licks Tapper’s tie — “It tastes like the news!”) to her total disregard for the conflicts of interest and her nearly inhuman ethos of dead eyes and shriveled grins. Conway even snaps herself back together after she falls out of Tapper’s apartment window. Gone are the days of the SNL that poked momentary fun with “A Day Off” or their Chicago musical parody, “Kellyanne Conway.” Make no mistake: President Donald Trump’s adviser was not just the fodder for another laugh. She was eviscerated, artfully and purposefully.
Coupled with SNL actress Melissa McCarthy’s own two masterclasses in Sean Spicer impressions and Alec Baldwin’s continued badgering of Trump via impression, it appears that the writers, producers and actors all have turned their focus away from lighthearted humor. Attention is now focused on an echoing, precise review of what is slowly shaping up to be the regime of an autocratic demagogue and his cast of goons. The show was not always destined to be only political commentary — it was social commentary first, political commentary second. Clearly, that changed during and after 2016. More than any other political comedy on air today, SNL is beginning to fulfill a very important and pertinent historical role in response to a regime deaf to criticism. 
The French Revolution saw its own satirists and cartoonists illustrate the much-hated monarchy in twisted and sharp manners. It is characteristic, unfortunately, of satire to emerge front-and-center when traditional written criticism is suppressed. It is in this same fashion that the Trump administration has encouraged the mistrust of traditional, unbiased news, to the point where even CNN is largely questioned and The New York Times seems almost entirely dismissed. 
Thus it comes as no surprise that, with Trump’s ties to Russia, comments about women and the “inner cities,” egregious Muslim ban, comments toward public officials and habit of hanging up on world leaders and now the Flynn scandal, that we are facing a regime that will almost certainly not respond to intelligent written criticism. The best denigration of autocratic regimes throughout history has always been image-based. Just as we watch the erosion of our democracy and democratic values, so too do we watch the natural emergence of responses that are only too telling about the political climate at hand. So we’ll enjoy SNL — at least until Trump bans it via Executive Tweet. 
The Trump regime’s masterful ability to goad the American public into a complete distrust of the fourth estate — the one respectable, democratic institution consistently responsible for maintaining an accountable democracy — has resulted in the discrediting of the traditional centrist media. Said regime is a circus of buffoons that don’t care about the nation’s values, the purpose of their offices and certainly not about the intellectual think pieces and credible news accounts that, because of their 100-IQ minimum required for reading, are carved out only for those peskily intelligent “liberal elites.” But they do care about their portrayal on SNL — which Donald Trump makes a habit of bashing on Twitter at around 3 a.m.
And that’s the best part of SNL’s commentary, and what makes it so popular. SNL merely takes the administration as it is, and forces its eyes to meet the mirror. The impression is more telling than the thinkpiece. It forces viewers to think — to compare the two, the impression and the man, and ask themselves if the two are really that different.
And SNL knows it — if its commitment to female actors portraying all of Trump’s misogynist goons is anything to go by. McKinnon herself tackled professional racist Attorney General Jeff Sessions last Saturday with one very piercing stand-alone line in an over-the-top Southern warble: “So, we all know there’s two types of crime: Regular and black.” 
When we study revolutions and regimes of the past, the most telling sources to describe how the people felt are always art. The impressions go on and on, each one sharper than the last: Trump, Spicer, Conway, Sessions, Vice President Mike Pence and First Lady Melania Trump. It is certainly an interesting time to be alive — that is, when a parody show is more transparent and telling than the regime it seeks to embody.

The men’s basketball team heads across the city to rematch with No. 6 UCLA on Saturday, facing off against a Bruins team hungry for revenge. 
The last time these two teams met, the Trojans delivered a stinging 84-76 loss in the Galen Center. At the time, UCLA was sitting at No. 8 in the country, carried on the back of standout freshman Lonzo Ball. At guard, Ball averages 35.7 points per game and delivers explosive performances that earned him a spot on the shortlist for the Wooden Award. 
But at the Galen Center against the Trojans, Ball’s offensive spark sputtered out, sinking only 15 points as the unranked Trojans knocked off their fiercest rivals.
Now, the Trojans must travel to the UCLA home court to compete against a team that used that loss as a springboard. UCLA took a hit in their ranking after falling to USC. But after manhandling Washington and Washington State, the Bruins took down Oregon to climb back into the top 10 and knock on the door of the top five rankings.
After their loss at the Galen Center, Ball and the Bruins made it clear that the loss would only fuel them in the future. No matter what, the team has made it clear — losing will not be an option for the Bruins on Saturday.
“Even losing one is uncomfortable, let alone four in a row,” UCLA center Thomas Welsh said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. “This is a big game for sure. We want to keep our win steak going and end that losing streak against USC.”
But the Trojans won’t be the same team that the Bruins faced back in January either. The return of sophomore Bennie Boatwright at the start of February paved the way to a win streak that was only ended by No. 7 Oregon. Although they remain unranked nationally, the Trojans sit on the cusp of breaking into the AP Top 25 poll with 16 votes. In the Pac-12, the team sits in fifth place, just behind unranked 9-4 Cal. The other teams ahead of USC — Arizona, Oregon and UCLA — are all ranked in the AP Top 10.
If the last five games have proved anything for the Trojans, it’s that they can hang with the top in the conference and the top in the country. Despite losing to Oregon at home, the Trojans surged into a comeback late in the game, pulling within 3 points in the final quarter. A dry spell from the field sent the comeback to a grinding halt, but the Trojans took away a note of hope from the game.
“It shows we can play with anybody,” freshman guard De’Anthony Melton said. “We need to learn how to close out games.”
Against UCLA, the Trojans will face several factors in their search for a regular season sweep of their crosstown rivals. They’ll need to shut down Ball on both the interior and the exterior. Keeping the freshman out of the paint and out of his element from behind the line was the key to the Trojans’ first victory, but it’s not a performance that Ball will look to repeat. 
Finally, the Trojans must find a spark outside of the typical scoring core of Boatwright, junior guard Jordan McLaughlin and sophomore forward Chimezie Metu. Last game, that was redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron, who earned Pac-12 Player of the Week after notching a career-high 23 points against the Bruins.
Although the top three teams are dominating the discussion of the Pac-12 Championship race, a victory on Saturday could keep USC in that conversation.
The past month has shown that the Trojans can play with anybody. On Saturday, they’ll have the chance to prove that they’re here to win, not just play.

With one conference win under their belts, the No. 4 Trojan lacrosse team will take on No. 9 Northwestern on Saturday at noon. Due to imminent weather conditions, the game has been rescheduled to Murdock Stadium at El Camino College in Torrance, Calif., where it will be played on their turf field. 
With a 1-0 record, the Trojans are looking to build off the strong momentum from last season as the reigning MPSF regular-season tournament champion. The team also made program history, competing in the NCAA quarterfinals to end the 2015-2016 season with a 20-1 overall record. 
In their four encounters, the Wildcats lead the all-times series 3-1 against the Trojans, but USC claimed its first win last spring with a 14-11 win in Evanston, Ill. Northwestern, which is head coach Lindsay Munday’s alma mater, presents a tough opposing team with a strong defensive unit, highlighted by sophomore goalie Mallory Weisse, who notched double-digit saves nine times in her career and earned the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week on Tuesday. 
Setting the tone with a 20-2 victory in its season opener against St. Mary’s, USC exhibited depth and offensive prowess with goals from 12 different Trojans. In the wake of this commanding win, the Trojans look to take it one game at a time and continue to focus on improving each and every day. 
“For us, it’s always about focusing on ourselves and getting better from the day before and the game before, but we need to be ready for a full 60 minute battle,” Munday said. “They’re a phenomenal team, so we need to be ready to battle.” 
With this competitive mindset, the Trojans are concentrating on restricting the Wildcat offense and maintaining ball control. 
“We want to make sure we stop some of their big shooters that rip pretty far outside,” senior attacker Kylie Drexel said. “We want to make sure that we slow them down and limit our turnovers and transition.”
With the loss of 15 graduating seniors from last year’s roster, returning veteran attackers Michaela Michael, Drexel and the Trojan seniors have risen to the challenge of leading by example. 
“They’ve done a great job of really taking all of these younger players under their wings and being great role models and leaders for the younger group,” Munday said. 
This year, USC has added nine freshmen to the squad, and Munday feels that  their youth has contributed a fresh perspective and commitment to building on the success that the team has created in just five years of the program.
“They bring a new energy and they just continue to buy into the foundation of the program,” Munday said. 
One of the key factors in the Trojans’ success has been the camaraderie between the girls and confidence that each member has in themselves and the team.
“We have players that buy in and they believe — from day one of this program, people have really bought in, and they believe that we can get to where we are right now,” Munday said. “For us, that’s all we can ask as coaches — for people to work hard, to have fun and believe in themselves and each other and this group. And they’ve really done that.”

USC men’s basketball’s win over UCLA at home last month prompted nothing short of euphoria for Trojan hoops fans. It was the perfect storm: Not only had the Trojans toppled their archrivals, but it was also the fourth straight win over UCLA, a top 10 team with national championship aspirations. 
Coupled with football’s back-to-back blowout wins over the Bruins in 2015 and 2016, the win marked a sudden spike in interest in men’s basketball, a spike high enough to garner a rarely seen sellout crowd of 10,258 at the Galen Center. 
Given the state of the two programs — USC is up-and-coming and still trying to find consistent footing in the Pac-12, while UCLA is stacked with talent across the board — it is a little strange how dominant the Trojans have been over their crosstown rivals; if they beat the Bruins on Saturday at Pauley Pavilion, they will have their longest win streak over UCLA since 1943. 
But anyone expecting it to be a breeze should be forewarned. The Bruins seem to have awoken and rediscovered that they are, indeed, good at basketball — and it might have been the Trojans’ win last month that provided the spark.
Since losing 84-76 to USC on Jan. 25, the Bruins have cruised past four opponents — they blew out Washington State and Oregon State, dropped 107 points on Washington and followed it up by toppling No. 5 Oregon — climbing back to the No. 6 ranking nationally.
“The USC game kind of woke us up, put us back in [our] place and we’ve been playing better basketball ever since,” UCLA freshman guard Lonzo Ball told the Los Angeles Times. 
Their win over the Ducks last Thursday did enough to quiet any doubters about whether the Bruins were ranked too high. They overcame a 19-point deficit, with their dynamic offense (which averages 91.9 points per game and leads all of college basketball) roaring to life and young phenoms from Aaron Holiday to Ball stepping up and hitting clutch shots. 
It was Ball who iced the game with an insane, Steph Curry-like step-back 3-pointer from well beyond the arc, the kind of shot that makes you wonder how it’s fair for a 19-year-old to do these things with a basketball.
Two days later, USC had its chance at Oregon at the Galen Center, but couldn’t pull off the upset despite taking a brief lead in the second half and keeping the score close down the stretch. 
While the Trojans losing to a better team was no surprise, the way they lost was more noteworthy. They shot themselves in the foot, committing 17 turnovers, missed open shots and couldn’t seem to inbound the ball properly. 
Their respective results against Oregon are indicative of what sets USC and UCLA apart right now. The Bruins have a stockpile of NBA-caliber talent, capable of unleashing an offensive tirade at any moment, while the Trojans have a strong roster — albeit nowhere near the talent that UCLA possesses — but lack in consistency and experience.
In a few ways, any hype that USC now “owns” UCLA in basketball is a bit overblown. Their 3-0 season sweep over the Bruins last season came in a down year for the school in Westwood, a campaign that saw UCLA drop five straight games late in the season and missed the NCAA Tournament entirely after two straight appearances in the Sweet Sixteen. This was a team with Bryce Alford and Isaac Hamilton doing everything, a team that didn’t yet have top recruits TJ Leaf or Ball or a more-developed Holiday. 
Now, this is a team leading the nation in scoring with six players averaging double figures, shooting 53.3 percent from the field and 41.8 percent from 3-point range. Those are monster stats, by any account.
That’s not to say the Trojans should be discredited for their recent stretch of success against UCLA, especially the home win last month that is arguably the biggest in head coach Andy Enfield’s tenure to date. They executed to perfection, spreading the floor, knocking down shots and stifling the Bruins’ dynamic offense with a zone defense that prevented big men Thomas Welsh and Leaf from making an impact. 
They also forced 17 turnovers from UCLA, including seven from Ball alone, as the freshman star could not make his usual impact.
We’ll find out on Saturday if the Bruins adjust, or if the Trojans are simply their Achilles’ heel. We’ll see if the Trojans learned from their mistakes against Oregon, if they can get through this brutal stretch of conference play — they face No. 5 Arizona next Thursday to wrap up three consecutive games against top-10 opponents — with at least one statement win.
It would not be a shocker if the Trojans suffer a blowout loss on Saturday against a hungry, rolling Bruins squad that won’t be as lackluster and careless as it was at the Galen Center last month. But, just as that game was a pleasant surprise, this one could be too. 
In the long run, this matchup doesn’t mean a lot. Both teams will probably make the NCAA Tournament: UCLA as a high seed who some will pick to win it all in their brackets, USC as a lower seed aiming to catch fire and make a run up the bracket. 
Nonetheless, it is USC versus UCLA, a rivalry no matter the sport or scenario. And though UCLA looks better on paper and USC’s recent edge in the crosstown matchup may not be that relevant, we know this to be true: The Bruins don’t run L.A. hoops — at least, until they can beat the Trojans.

It’ll probably be raining by the time this goes to print, which means everyone will skip their Friday classes and either stay in watching Netflix or contemplate going to the gym. It’s always a toss-up at the Lyon Center on rainy days.
On the days I brave the precipitation for a gym session, I spend most of my miserable walk over there working up the motivation to overcome my dread of the treadmill. This workout machine of nightmares isn’t particularly difficult, but it can be boring beyond belief. There’s something so mentally frustrating about exerting so much effort and not going anywhere.
In fact, the earliest treadmill was practically a torture device. During the 1800s, the British actually forced prisoners to use a treadmill as a method of hard labor. The treadmill’s power would pump water or grind corn or simply do nothing at all except torture the prisoners. According to The Washington Post, running on a treadmill was considered one of the harshest forms of punishment for almost 100 years. It was outlawed in British prisons in 1889.
It’s not hard to see why. Treadmills are monotonous in a way that outdoor runs will never be. There are no quick dips in the sidewalk when you come to a driveway. There aren’t any traffic lights to give you an excuse to take a two-minute breather. There is no change of scenery, just a little flashing green dot that never seems to be going as fast as your legs are.
However, when I figured out how to use the pace consistency to my advantage, I discovered the secret to treadmill workouts. It’s pushing the pace. The faster you run, the faster you can get off the darned contraption. I started by just upping the speed with every lap that I completed. Every lap became a much harder challenge than the one before, but I surprised myself by how quickly I could get comfortable at a new pace. Before I knew it, I was running much faster than I ever do outside, and I shaved several minutes off of my usual 5K jog.
I found out treadmills are also great for speed workouts, which is one of the most underappreciated and underused training methods for casual runners. Ultimately, running is all about muscle memory, so forcing your legs and lungs to learn a new pace is the key to getting faster. Of course, most people can’t run much faster for long periods of time, so that’s where speed workouts come in. 
The idea is to alternate between a fast and slow pace, usually with a 1:2 ratio. That could mean running all out for one minute, and then walking for two minutes. It could also mean running a certain distance, and slow jogging twice that distance to recover. One of my favorite methods is to sprint during the chorus of songs in my running playlists and then take it easy during the verses. Silly speed workouts like that one remind me of how ironic it is that these torture machines of the past have ultimately become an element of modern-day leisure. 
Today, treadmills are a main staple in gyms and homes all over the world. Almost 40 percent of the $3.5 billion of fitness equipment retail sales in North America come from treadmills. 
What you’re paying for is control. The powerful thing about treadmills is that it gives you complete autonomy over your pace, your incline, your distance, your workout. I usually get off the treadmill after about 35 minutes, feeling a little unsteady on solid ground again but very confident that I completed a run that satisfied all of my physical goals for the day. 
When I get up the next day, the soreness from my treadmill workout has settled into my muscles overnight. I want to stretch out my legs on an easy run, but I can hear the cars splashing through puddles outside the window and know that it’s another nasty day without even looking. As much as I hate treadmills, I appreciate that it gives me the option to run on rainy days.

On Saturday, Angelenos will have their final opportunity to explore the exhibition Patrick Martinez: All Season Portfolio at the Charlie James Gallery in Chinatown. Artistically conscious audiences or those immersed in modern hip-hop culture are sure to have heard of Patrick Martinez.
As a Los Angeles native, Martinez’s Filipino, Mexican and Native American background lends itself to his work. Having been acquainted with art initially through graffiti culture, Martinez genuinely captures the raw aspects of everyday life and human emotion. 
Innovative, extremely eclectic, comforting and strangely familiar, his work goes beyond gorgeous aesthetics. His neons, ceramic and painted work stand as beacons of light at a time when many feel surrounded by a darkness propagated by a lack of empathy. The driving force behind this darkness, and an issue eloquently tackled by Martinez, is a lack of attention.
Modern day America, particularly Los Angeles, is ridden with excess. Experiences are manufactured, memory is disposable and history is temporary. For his work, Martinez uses objects traditionally deemed as copious, disposable and forgettable to scream messages at their viewers.
 The neon signs that shine on the facades of nail salons and liquor stores are updated in this exhibit. Martinez’s use of neon signage exceeds the emotional consciousness of big-name contemporaries Tracey Emin and Jung Lee. 
Martinez’s work soars past emotion into the realm of politics, race and equality. Although controversial, Martinez is not afraid to create socially impactful works. 
His neon signage reads with messages like “THEN THEY CAME FOR ME,” “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA” with the word “UNITED” deliberately left unlit and “CURRENCY MEANS NOTHIN’ IF YOU STILL AIN’T FREE” — famous lyrics by rapper Tupac Shakur.
 The political outspokenness is typical of his work. His series of Pee-Chee folders depicting images of police brutality victims create a stark contrast between an everyday object of considerable innocence and a societal horror. 
He not only creates these pieces, but he also takes it upon himself to freely distribute them to students at a number of public schools throughout Los Angeles.
 At a time where artifice seems to be particularly inescapable, Martinez has found a way to communicate truth to the masses. His work oversees a plethora of connotations. His illuminated signage and ceramic work writhe with electric color establishing his ability, like that of Mark Rothko, to activate emotion through nuances in pigmentation.
The words on his neon signs and portraits on his folders force viewers to ponder issues of gender inequality and police injustice. The media which he chooses to create act as reminders to pay less attention to objects and more attention to the ideologies they represent.
 The potency of his work lies in his ability to deliver messages where they are not typically sought out. 
His pieces are familiar, but the stark realities they represent leave the room with a tinge of discomfort. Martinez’s use of America as a motif in his art reflects a time when people are questioning what it means to be American.
He illustrates through his choice of medium that anyone old enough to carry a folder or recognize a neon sign is old enough to be politically and socially conscious. 
His Pee-Chee folders silently scream that the answers to intolerance and injustice are not simple but lie in education. Despite the viewer’s political stance, they cannot dismiss that Martinez’s artwork gracefully and unapologetically forces the viewer to pay attention, and for that, he is an artistic force to be reckoned with.
Correction: An earlier version of this article contained a deck that stated that Paul Martinez was the artist. The artist’s name is actually Patrick Martinez. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Big Little Lies, HBO’s new limited series, explores the dramatic lives of three apparently ideal housewives as they deal with a homicide in the picturesque, wealthy town of Monterey, Calif.
The series, which based on Liane Moriarty’s bestselling novel, contains a dual storyline including a dramatic narrative about the materialism and social status of the Monterey housewives and a suspenseful investigation of a murder mystery. 
The series begins on the first day of school at Otter Bay Elementary. As the parents of first-grade students congregate at the campus to pick up their children, they are advised by the teacher to stay for a quick meeting. In front of both the children and parents, the teacher calls attention to an unfortunate incident that has taken place during the school day.
One of the students has choked another student, evident by bruises on the child’s neck. The teacher tells the victim to point out the choker in front of the entire crowd. The child points to the innocent new boy, who has just moved to Monterey with his mom, Jane, to start a new life.
The situation creates the initial tensions among many of the housewives, which quickly develop into a series of betrayals, conflicts and murder. As the intriguing story unfolds, the audience is exposed to the occurrences behind the closed doors of each housewife’s seemingly perfect mansion. 
Big Little Lies has three strong female lead characters: Madeline (Reese Witherspoon), Celeste (Nicole Kidman) and Jane (Shailene Woodley). 
Madeline is the image-obsessed socialite of Monterey. She is immediately typecasted into a static role as the materialistic villain among the other first-grade moms in this series. Madeline’s villainous character trait is repeatedly overemphasized in the script, overshadowing the positive and emotional personality traits that make up her character. 
Although Witherspoon is able to deliver her lines effortlessly and depict the appropriate emotions and expressions on cue, she is unable to transform her role as Madeline into a multidimensional character. This is because of the troubled script, rather than Witherspoon’s acting.
Celeste is the reserved housewife known for having a deceivingly perfect marriage. According to Celeste’s Facebook page and her perceived appearance, she seems to have it all: She has healthy twin boys, a sexy younger husband and plenty of money. However, Celeste’s happiness and marriage is a façade: Her husband is abusive and she constantly feels trapped in her enclosed life. 
Kidman took a sensitive approach when embodying the character of Celeste to create depth within her character. Kidman draws upon emotions and body language to gain sympathy from the audience regarding Celeste’s reality as a victim of domestic violence. At the same time, Kidman uses facial cues to expose Celeste’s darker side — the side that exudes power and pleasure from the gender dynamic with her husband. 
Jane is Monterey’s newest housewife; she is a young single mom who has just moved from Santa Cruz in order to start a new life. The relationship that Woodley is able to convey between her character Jane and her on-screen son feels natural, authentic and true. 
Woodley’s calm tone of voice, reserved body positioning and subtle facial expressions perfectly match the personality traits intended for Jane. These deliberate acting choices cast Jane as not only an outsider among her peers, but also someone who has something to hide. 
Big Little Lies, HBO’s new seven-episode series will premiere on Sunday.

Athena Lim | Daily Trojan
One of the best things about living in Los Angeles is our exposure to different cultures. Los Angeles Chinatown is one of my favorite places to visit in the city, with its many restaurants, colorful pagodas and special events. During the day, the stores open early, selling everything from Chinese qibaos, paper fans, toys and so much more. As the day progresses and the sky darkens, lanterns hanging between the buildings light up, lighting up the space with colorful reds and golds.
Let’s start with a little history. In 1938, California Gov. Frank Merriam dedicated the Los Angeles Chinatown Central Plaza in a ceremony. The plaza was built to serve as a center for the vibrant Chinese American community in Los Angeles. Fast forward to 2017, and people still find that the space really does capture the Chinese American community and its unique culture.
I’ve been to Chinatown so many times in my three years in L.A., but I’ve never had a chance to go there during the Lunar New Year celebration. This year, though, I made a promise to myself that I would go there for the festivities. I was unable to go there during the New Year weekend, but I went there the weekend after to see the parade.
Athena Lim | Daily Trojan
It was a party in every sense. Confetti flew merrily in the air and covered the ground in brightly colored paper. Street vendors and food trucks filled the air with the aroma of delicious foods and snacks. Visitors dressed in traditional Chinese clothing took pictures with the red lanterns in the background. Shaolin masters and apprentices showed their skills and took photos with children. People lined up on the streets to watch the festive parade floats passing by.
I noticed that people of all backgrounds came there to celebrate. It wasn’t only the Chinese Americans. I talked to a Mexican American college student who learned Shaolin martial arts and who appreciated Chinese culture in general. I met a South African girl, a Swedish family and a Vietnamese couple who absolutely loved the parade. It was then that I realized just how wonderfully diverse Los Angeles is. Places like Chinatown preserve its culture and invite others to join the community at the same time. I find that truly amazing.
There are also a lot of other special events in Chinatown. In the summer, there is the “Chinatown Summer Nights,” a popular event featuring food trucks, cooking demonstrations, Chinese cultural activities and concerts and dance parties in the Central Plaza. The Mid-Autumn festival, better known as the “Moon Festival,” features cultural acts including lion dances and kung fu performances, Chinese cultural workshops, art gallery openings, storytelling and ping pong tournaments.
What a poorly written article.  No references, no celebration dates, nothing.  This is the work of an 8th grader submitting a writing assignment.  It’s a “C” paper..
Terrible!
Pssst, Athena:  “Who, What, When, Where and Why”.

Photo from Tech Op
Why is Siri female? 
Apple’s personal assistant on its devices has a voice that is distinctly female. We order Amazon Echo’s Alexa to perform the tasks that the we want. Microsoft’s Cortana, Google’s S Voice and countless other voice command software in GPS navigation systems, apps and websites are all programmed as female. There’s a reason for this: Studies repeatedly show that people overwhelmingly prefer female voices to male voices when it comes to digital assistants.
Both cultural bias and our dependence on technology influence the way that we often program AI to be female. Traditionally, “helper” roles such as telephone operators, personal assistants, and secretaries have been female or portrayed as female in popular media. Clifford Nass, a researcher from Stanford, writes in his book that people expect help from female voices and characters, while a male voice is considered more authoritative. It’s no wonder, then, that we’re hardwired to expect digital assistants to have female voices, and that companies make the strategic choice to have programmers and scriptwriters characterize them as such. 
The movies Her and Ex Machina are also demonstrations of this pattern. Scarlett Johansson voices the personal AI companion, Samantha, in the former, and the protagonist Theodore unwittingly falls in love with her before ultimately learning that she has millions of other representations operating for a multitude of different users. In Ex Machina, we see a self-aware, intelligent, strong AI robot called Ava, created by a tech CEO named Nathan, invoke passionate feelings of both love and lust, influencing and even manipulating Nathan’s employee, Caleb, to meet his death. 
The characterizations of these AI women in sci-fi films speak to the fetishization and eroticization of female bots by media as well as by our larger society, creating concerns about constructing a gendered, highly-sexualized, and raced robot body. It sets a precarious precedent for the way we view women and how stereotypes are maintained and perpetuated. When women are sexualized through the robot or AI body, we are presented with the possible dehumanization of female characters.
It’s interesting to consider that gender roles and stereotypes are embedded into technology by decisions made by programmers or higher-ups in tech companies and entertainment studios, to name a few. 
Consider the simplest form of machine learning — an internet search. Researchers from Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in Brazil searched using keywords for “beautiful” and “ugly” women in 59 different countries, then categorized the resulting photos into different racial and age categories. They discovered that “beautiful” women tended to be white and young, while the “ugly” keyword returned images of older, black or Asian women. All searches are determined by algorithms that determine what internet users see in search results; these human-determined algorithms perpetuate racial and gender stereotypes and reinforce biases already present in society. 
Another study done by a team of researchers at Google in 2013 parsed vector spaces from a database of 3 million words taken from Google News. What they found was that when examining relationships between words, the database search would return results such as “father : doctor :: mother : x”, then x = nurse. The query “man : computer programmer :: woman : x” would give x = homemaker. Blatant sexism, even on platforms controlled by those considered to be professional journalists, could be demonstrated with a simple algorithm.
But if AI and technology that we view and use in our everyday lives are all determined by algorithms and human decisions, there’s tangible progress that we can make to combat stereotypes and biases. For example, we can apply de-biasing algorithms to the same search engines or vector spaces to return results that promote the opposite of the status quo and offer more equal representation. We can make sure that search results for certain keywords don’t offer skewed outcomes. There’s a lot more work to be done to analyze the societal implications of programming and characterizing AI as female as we continue our rapid developments in AI and machine learning, but much room for positive change.

Before coming to London in January for a semester, most of my opinions of London were based on ‘90s romantic comedies. In fact, I have watched a young, tongue-tied Hugh Grant fall in love with a pretty brunette in London so many times, that I half expected him to greet me at Heathrow International Airport as seen in Love Actually. Spoiler alert, it did not happen, and thus love, actually, is not all around. From sheepish travel bookstore owner Hugh Grant in Notting Hill to young, heartthrob Prime Minister Hugh Grant in Love Actually to painfully shy and perpetual wedding attendee Hugh Grant in Four Weddings and a Funeral, I was pretty sure London was just one big Hugh Grant movie and this semester I got to be a supporting cast member.
So, because I couldn’t let Hugh down, I spent my first few weeks visiting every major British rom-com landmark. I was on a time-traveling tour back to the golden age of rom coms. I perused secondhand books in the pastel, picturesque wonderland of Notting Hill like American Anna Scott in Notting Hill, I explored Harrods, primped and made-up with holiday decorations, and waited far too long for gift-wrapping like Alan Rickman in Love Actually, and even attended mass in a British Cathedral (though it was neither a wedding or a funeral, it was as close as I could get to the plot points of Four Weddings and a Funeral).
Emma Peplow | Daily Trojan
Though these cinematic masterpieces (before you scoff, lest I remind you that Four Weddings and a Funeral received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture?) were a useful springboard for experiencing London, ultimately I took not being greeted by Hugh Grant at each location as a sign that I needed to create my own London experience. The classic 1999 film may have brought me to Notting Hill, but the charming beauty and quiet vibrance is what brought me back. Just as the movie shows, Notting Hill is a quiet community in West London best known for its narrow, colorful houses and quaint shops. On weekends, the city comes alive for a market held on the main road, Portobello Road. Stalls carrying everything from records to books to antique tea sets to some of the best falafel I’ve ever consumed line the two-mile road. White tents are set up above the antiques and vintage goods, shielding them from the always present threat of rainfall, and lying just below the pastel blues and cotton candy pinks of the houses that rise along the skyline behind them.

After a month in London, there is one thing that I have learned for sure: Londoners do not take markets lightly. Rain or shine (though mostly rain), people from all over the United Kingdom and the world come out to street markets for their diverse array of food and goods. Though there are countless markets around London, what makes Notting Hill’s special is the vintage goods and character of the vendors. Notting Hill used to be a hub for the ’70s British rock and roll scene and there is still a poignant sense of this history and culture that lies in the streets. Behind the picturesque, almost movie-set looking view of suburbia the colorful houses present lie shops commemorating the music history and cultural revolution that the town played a part in. Street art litters the walls a few blocks past the Easter egg-looking homes — a graffiti outline of Amelia Earhart stares boldly at you with “Courage has no gender” scribbled underneath, two Virgin Marys embrace each other in a religious and politically charged depiction. All this speaks to the inner tension in Notting Hill. Past the manicured, perfectly painted doors lies evidence of the clamor, spontaneity and instability of ‘70s rock and roll.

To me, Notting Hill was the beautiful wonderland tailor-made for love stories between beautiful bookish people, but after visiting I learned it was so much more than just the Notting Hill Bookshop. It’s where contemporary arts and culture meets Victorian townhomes, where the old greets the new, and where the locals welcome the travelers. 
Anna Scott may have come to Notting Hill to ask a boy to love her, but I came as a girl standing in front of a whole city asking to be a part of it. 
So will Notting Hill and I live happily ever after like Anna Scott and William Thacker? Well, let’s just say I have a lot more London to explore before we can be exclusive, so stay tuned.
