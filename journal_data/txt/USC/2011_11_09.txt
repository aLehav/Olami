A Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market grocery store is slated to open for the holiday season around either December or January, according to University Gateway.
Market value · Superior Grocers is the closest supermarket to campus. The opening of Fresh & Easy Neighbor Market is slated for the end of the semester. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
Construction of the store, which will be the fourth in the Los Angeles area,  began Tuesday at University Gateway, amid great student interest and anticipation.
It has been speculated the new store will attract customers from university students living on the south side of campus.
Though Ralphs is situated about a half-mile away from campus and a Superior Grocers is available in University Village, student shoppers have vocalized the need for a more conveniently located grocery store near campus.
“A grocery store at Gateway would be very optimal for students living on campus, especially freshmen who don’t have cars to go to Ralphs or Target,” said Rip Singh, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “There aren’t a lot of options for students around USC to get groceries so it should alleviate that demand a bit.”
Johann Manning, a freshman majoring in business administration, said Fresh & Easy would provide a more student-oriented supermarket.
“I like the idea of a grocery store more for students that is somewhere in between the dining dollar system of Seeds, which is way too expensive, and Superior, which usually doesn’t carry quality produce,” Manning said.
Gabrielle Miller, an undecided freshman, said she believes there is no need for another supermarket near the USC campus.
“I don’t think it’s necessary because we have Superior at University Village, which isn’t too far away,” Miller said. “If they opened a Target there, that would be a very different story.”
Fresh & Easy’s proximity to campus and the variety of food it will offer will attract students, said Anandi Hira, a graduate student studying computer science.
“Having a grocery store right next to campus will be nice,” Hira said. “I will probably start shopping at the Fresh & Easy instead of going to Superior, which has fewer and lower quality produce in my opinion.”
Fresh and Easy?  YUCK!  Why not Trader Joes?
Superior will be gone  with village at USC. Fresh & Easy will be a need for a  few years.
Downtown residents have been craving an alternative to Ralphs Fresh Fare.  I wonder how many of them will head south on the Expo Line to shop at Fresh & Easy.
How does this affect a potential Trader Joe’s at The Village?
FYI there is a Target opening soon downtown at 7th & Fig which students can get to via light rail when the expo line opens in the next month or two.

One of the major obstacles for students seeking internships and jobs in Los Angeles is the availability and accessibility of public transportation to and from the job location.
Getting around · Increasing public transportation in the Los Angeles area could benefit students who intern around the city. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
Four out of five voters in Southern California are in favor of expansion of public transportation, according to a study released by the Southern California Association of Governments this month.
Carl Martellino, executive director of the USC Career Planning and Placement Center, said increased access to public transportation would expand students’ internship and job opportunities.
“The more transportation improves, the more opportunities for internships in different parts of the city could open up,” Martellino said.
Expanded transportation would help alleviate the stress and time it takes students to travel to their internships, Martellino said.
“Students are pretty adaptable and find ways to get to their internship or they figure out how public transportation could work,” Martellino said. “Part of this is because we are so centrally located, but the easier we can make the access the better it is going to be.”
Catherine Burke, associate professor of public policy and a public transportation expert, said the current construction of new train lines, including the new Expo Line that will stop at USC, will benefit students seeking internships and jobs in Los Angeles.
“The new train system near campus will be very helpful for students,” Burke said. “Students will be able to take the [Expo] Line up to Union Station, and then they will have access to all the other trains giving students access.”
Burke, however, said the city needs to do more to expand Los Angeles’ public transportation system.
“Los Angeles needs much more cost effective transportation so that they can run 24/7,” Burke said. “It would give students a lot more access than they realize.”
Bridget McAnany, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said getting to her internship downtown would be difficult without public transportation.
“Because I don’t have a car on campus, if I didn’t have access to public transportation, I wouldn’t be able to have a job,” McAnany said.
Shakyra Moore, a sophomore majoring in business administration, takes the bus to her internship downtown as well. She said increasing public transportation in the city would help students with internships as well as other Angelinos.
“Los Angeles is super spread out and there’s a lot of people here,” Moore said. “Not everyone wants to drive because of traffic. Even if I did have a car, it would probably take me longer to get down there than taking the bus would.”

Events focused on the relationship between the United States and China this week highlight the increasingly strong ties USC has forged with China.
Clayton Dube, associate director of the USC U.S.-China Institute said he encourages students to be aware of the United States-China relationship because it will likely affect their personal and professional futures.
“There are a lot of opportunities for students that choose to focus on China because there are more job prospects,” Dube said. “Student’s can’t escape being affected by the U.S.-China relationship. It is only going to become increasingly close, complex and important.”
On Wednesday, the USC U.S.-China Institute hosted Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China, an event that showcased Ezra Vogel, author and scholar of East Asia, as part of USC’s increased emphasis on China.
Vogel summarized his 10-year study and book on Xiaoping’s leadership. Xiaoping held various political positions, primarily in the Communist Party of China, between 1929 and 1989. Xiaoping modernized the country by focusing his efforts on the improvement of education, science and technology, Vogel said.
Though Xiaoping died in 1997, “he had more impact on the 21st century than any other leader,” Vogel said.
Phillip Wilcox, a graduate student studying politics and international relations, said he appreciates all of the connections USC has with China and that he intends to take advantage of them.
“There are so many resources at USC, especially the U.S.-China Institute that has events where they bring great people to speak,” Wilcox said. “It’s important to have a nuanced knowledge of China’s culture and history so we can understand their global outlook.”
Dube said China is growing as an economic power and is becoming an integral part of American life. Through policies, such as free trade, citizens of both countries are being positively and negatively affected.
“On one hand, [free trade] made it easier for consumers because we all benefit from low priced goods,” Dube said. “On the other hand the amount of U.S. manufacturers have decreased and energy is created less efficiently leading to more pollution.”
The existing cultural exchange between the two countries can be seen on campus. Several schools within the university give students the opportunity to study in China and there are 2,515 students from China attending USC, according to Dube.
In the 1970’s, interaction between the United States and China was preoccupied with geopolitical issues rather than economics and culture, Dube said.
“Today’s relationship is multidimensional and much deeper than it was in the past,” Dube said. “When it was first formed, very few people were involved but now everyone is somehow touched by the connection.”
Sarah Francis, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said China offers vast opportunities for USC students.
“Any major can be applicable by going to China,” Francis said. “There is only so much you can learn in the classroom, but there is an invaluable experience in going there and learning firsthand.”
Catherine Uong, a sophomore majoring in business administration and East Asian language and cultures, spent spring break 2011 in Shanghai as part of the Global Leadership Program, an organization in the USC Marshall School of Business that allows students to visit foreign countries.
“China is becoming a superpower, so people are looking into that direction more and more and want to study or intern there,” Uong said. “It pushes students to have a more of an open mind and become global citizens rather than just American citizens.”
I’m a 2009 marshall grad living in Beijing.  Sure, China might be growing.  However, this is largely due to the fact that the country is so large and never opened itself to the West for development until a few decades ago. There are laborers employed a few hundred feet from where I live that just shovel dirt through a sifter all day.  Even though the US is experiencing some difficult economic times, the standard of living is 10x higher.  Come see for yourself first hand if you don’t believe me.  Fighting on from Beijing.
Anyway, situation is changing. We still need more time to adjust ourselves to the international track of development. It’s unfair for a young country to learn in a short time what takes centuries for the western world .

A fully healthy football team is practically an oxymoron, but it is close to being a reality for the No. 18 Trojans.
USC coach Lane Kiffin said Wednesday that just about everyone on USC’s roster could be available for Saturday’s game against Pac-12 foe Washington.
“Everybody did a lot of stuff today outside of [senior defensive tackle] DaJohn Harris,” Kiffin said. “[Redshirt sophomore cornerback] Torin Harris was even able to do some things today. We have the anticipation that everybody could be playing Saturday, which is obviously good for us.”
The younger Harris, who is one of two USC starting cornerbacks, has not played since he injured a nerve in his shoulder on Sept. 24 in a loss to Arizona State.
—
Junior tailback Curtis McNeal is set to make another start for USC on Saturday, but the team will continue to use the other tailbacks at its disposal. Despite missing the Trojans’ last game at Colorado on Friday, senior tailback Marc Tyler is expected to factor into the rotation, as well as freshman Amir Carlisle, who nabbed his first touchdown of his career against the Buffaloes.
“Most likely, Curtis [McNeal] will start, and we’ll look for [Tyler] to play as well,” Kiffin said.
—
After a game without its starting safeties, the Trojans anticipate the return of starting junior Jawanza Starling and junior T.J. McDonald.
“Prior to injury, Jawanza [Starling] was paying very well, playing some of his best ball since he’s been here,” Kiffin said. “And then T.J. [McDonald has] been playing at a really high level. We’ve been playing Drew [McAllister] the last few weeks anyway, so we’ll continue to make sure to get him in the game.”
—
Sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey has come on strong with his play recently, and was noticeably energetic in practice this week. But Kiffin insists this is Robey’s normal work ethic.
“That’s who he is since the first day I ever met him when he came onto our campus at Tennessee,” Kiffin said. “[He was] first in every line, first in every drill, wanted extra work, was staying after with [associate head coach Monte Kiffin] getting work in between sessions at camp. He’s so dedicated to being great.”
Saturday’s game might be even bigger for Robey. This weekend would have been the birthday of his mother, who passed away shortly after Robey committed to USC in February 2010.
“A bunch of his family will be out here to celebrate [his mother’s birthday],” Kiffin said. “It’s even more special for him this week, and he wants to make some big plays.”

With No. 18 USC just two days away from hosting Washington at the Coliseum, Huskies coaches haven’t had many qualms about being the least bit frank when speaking with the media.
First, coach Steve Sarkisian told reporters during Monday’s press conference he would rather have junior quarterback Matt Barkley on his NFL team than Stanford signal caller Andrew Luck, the consensus No. 1 overall pick in next April’s NFL draft.
But it was defensive coordinator Nick Holt who provided the more incendiary comment.
“We’ll be okay against these guys,” Holt said of the Trojans. “I’d rather play USC than Oregon, quite honestly.”
At first glance, it really isn’t all that big of a deal. He’d rather play USC than Oregon? Who wouldn’t? Oregon sports a better, faster offense and has lost only to No. 1 LSU this season after falling to Auburn in the BCS National Championship game last year.
It’s not the boldest assertion for Holt to say he’d like to avoid the Ducks. But it’s the first part of the quote that should anger USC more. Within that seemingly innocent comment, Holt is hinting he holds a secret to stopping USC’s offense.
Holt’s history with USC is extensive. He was the team’s linebacker coach from 2001 to 2003 and the defensive coordinator from 2006 to 2008 before heading to Washington with Sarkisian for the 2009 season. USC coach Lane Kiffin was with USC for some of that time, too, so Holt might know some of his tendencies.
What’s more, Washington has defeated USC each of the last two years, so Holt should come in with some level of confidence. But there are some problems with that.
As few will forget, Barkley did not play in 2009. Last year, it wasn’t Washington’s defense that won the game, as it surrendered 31 points. If not for a masterful 10-play, 62-yard drive led by quarterback Jake Locker with 2:34 left in the fourth quarter — which included a clutch 18-yard pass on 4th-and-10 — to give Washington a game-winning field goal, the Huskies would have lost.
Holt has more of a problem on his hands than he realizes. The duo of Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods has been nearly unstoppable this season, and proves a tough attack to prepare for. Sure, Holt might decide the best course of action is to double cover Woods on most plays. But then there’s freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee, nearly as talented as Woods, on the other side of the field.
Just because USC doesn’t run a high-tempo spread offense with speed at pretty much every position doesn’t mean there aren’t complications in trying to stop its attack.
Then again, maybe Holt was just blowing smoke. Maybe he doesn’t really put any stock into what he said. Maybe he’s taking this game just as seriously as he took the game against Oregon. Maybe it’s all a plan to rile up the Trojans, much like Sarkisian’s comments about Barkley and Luck appeared to be.
It’s doubtful anyone at USC needs more motivation to win this game. Sure, the bowl stakes are negligible. But since Sarkisian and Holt defected to Washington, they haven’t felt the sting of losing to USC.
Barkley will show up, even though he doesn’t get another shot to beat Locker. Woods and Lee will show up. Junior and senior tailbacks Curtis McNeal and Marc Tyler will show up. The whole team is going to be focused on winning this game.
Washington’s defense might not be winded every play after dealing with the quick legs of Oregon’s LaMichael James, Kenjon Barner and De’Anthony Thomas. It might not have to deal with triple options, sweeps and nonsensical audible cards on the sideline.
But if USC has anything to say about it, Saturday’s game will be just as tough on the Huskies’ defense as last week’s was. Holt’s comments might have been about 60 game minutes premature.

When redshirt sophomore center Dewayne Dedmon and junior center James Blasczyk graduated from high school in 2008, each had a better shot at knocking down a blindfolded full-court heave than knowing what the future had in store for them on the basketball court.
Filling big shoes · Redshirt sophomore center Dewayne Dedmon is expected to make an immediate impact for the Trojans this season. - Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan
Dedmon was headed to Antelope Valley College to go to school part-time, while simultaneously honing the basketball skills he’d just discovered playing organized basketball for the first time his senior year.
Blasczyk, on the other hand, was ranked as a top-50 prospect in the state of Texas by Texashoops.com, and had decided to attend Texas A&M.
Three-and-a-half years and several transfers later, the two 7-foot centers have joined forces, hoping to serve as a formidable front court duo for the USC men’s basketball team this season.
“That’s a big matchup problem, because you’ve got two seven-footers that can rebound the ball,” Dedmon said. “If the other team has just one predominant big man, then the little guy is going to have to guard the other seven-footer on the team, so it’ll be a mismatch down low with that, and we’ll have openings.”
After averaging 6.6 points and 7.8 rebounds for Antelope Valley College, Dedmon transferred to USC in 2010, sitting out all of last season in order to preserve three years of eligibility. Despite Dedmon’s inexperience, USC coach Kevin O’Neill insists Dedmon will be a future NBA draft selection — if he were to leave — come June.
“There’s no question [Dedmon is] a first-round pick,” O’Neill told ESPN.com last summer. “And he’ll average a double-double in his first year [at USC].”
Even still, Dedmon isn’t daunted by his pending Division-I debut.
“It adds pressure, but at the same time, you’ve just got to keep playing your game,” Dedmon said.
“Playing your game” is a bit tougher when wearing a cast, as Dedmon recently discovered. After breaking his right hand during a team practice Oct. 11, the 7-foot, 255-pound big man decided to turn his misfortune into inspiration by developing his naturally dominant, but little-used, left hand.
“I’m actually left-handed, I just play with my right hand,” Dedmon said. “If I had a choice to go left or right, I would always go right. But now that this is forcing me to go left every time, I’m a lot more confident in it. I’ll definitely use both hands [in games].”
The cast, however, was removed during the Trojans’ closed scrimmage Saturday against Air Force, and Dedmon is expected to be back in the lineup when the season begins Friday against CSU Northridge.
According to Dedmon, a stronger left hand has helped him develop.
“I feel like I’ve improved in every way,” Dedmon said.
Blasczyk, a 7-foot-1, 260-pound bruiser with a soft shooting touch, is anxious to return to the hardwood after transferring twice that took him from Texas A&M to Lee College before eventually finding the right fit at USC.
“I’ve pretty much been sitting out three years, so I’m ready to play,” Blasczyk said. “I redshirted twice, and I sat out at A&M.”
Blasczyk’s interest in the Trojans stems from the warm, family vibe he feels from O’Neill and the rest of his staff.
“I can walk into [Coach O’Neill’s] office any time I want,” Blasczyk said. “At A&M I had to schedule three weeks ahead of time to talk to [coach Mark] Turgeon. Even when I wanted to transfer, I had to schedule an appointment to tell them I wanted to transfer.”
Now that Blasczyk has finally found his comfort zone at USC, he hopes to continue to progress in skills specific to his position.
Dedmon is projected to be the Trojans’ starting center, but Blasczyk will play an important role coming off the bench and should log major minutes.
In some instances, O’Neill might opt to send his two big men into the fray at the same time.
“It gives us NBA-type size on the floor,” O’Neill said. “We’re experimenting a lot …  with Dewayne at the three spot because he’s agile enough to do that, and a good enough shooter. We’re just trying to figure [who are] going to be our best five guys to have on the floor.”
As for Dedmon’s anticipated responsibilities on the team, he has a number of goals in mind to assist the Trojans.
“That’s why I’m here — to rebound, make shots and help us win,” Dedmon said.
Blasczyk, on the other hand, identified one trait in particular he and Dedmon are determined to emulate all season long.
“Toughness,” Blasczyk said.
We have winners on the court and off represented in this piece. The focus of the piece is great and the players worth following, but this writing is remarkable and shows another star in the making. Leaps and bounds beyond the usual!
This is yet another article written by a very talented and knowledgeable guy…I’ve been following his writings throughout high school and delighted to see that his talents are being developed and honed by such a fine university.  I look forward to more of his comments.

USC coach Ali Khosroshahin talks about one of the loves of his life as you would expect anyone so deeply entrenched in a committed relationship to speak of it. This love, Khosroshahin said, “put a bounce in my step, brought a smile to my face.” And it has captured him for as long as he can remember.
“One of my first memories is arguing with my mom to let me stay up and watch a soccer match, even though it was supposed to be my naptime,” Khosroshahin said.
Carlo Acenas & Kate Mock | Daily Trojan
Khosroshahin is in love with his sport. His passion is visible — be it on the field coaching or in the office slaving over depth charts, recruits and set plays at the end of a 12-hour day.
So it should come as no surprise that the team’s most recent season is not an easy one for him to talk about. Ranked No. 25 to start the year, the USC women’s soccer team went just 7-13 overall and 4-7 in the rugged Pac-12. At one point, it lost eight straight. And eight of its 13 losses came by a mere one-goal margin.
“This has been the most difficult season of my coaching career,” Khosroshahin said without hesitation before the Women of Troy’s season finale — a 5-2 loss to No. 2 UCLA. “It’s been difficult; it’s been challenging. Most of all, it’s been hard to see the kids suffer. It’s made me feel absolutely helpless at times.”
After a slow 0-3 start, it seemed the Women of Troy had gotten back on track when they ran off three straight victories to even their record at 3-3. Then, the season took a nosedive. They outplayed No. 2 Oklahoma State but fell 1-0. They blew a lead in the last 10 minutes to Texas at home before losing in double overtime. Portland, Washington State, Oregon State in overtime, Oregon: all one-goal losses.
But they did turn things around to some degree, winning four of their last six games, including an emotional 1-0 victory over Arizona on Senior Day.
But Khosroshahin is aware of, and even talks openly about, the expectations of all athletic programs at USC, where 7-13 and no postseason just doesn’t cut it.
“This type of season is something this school hasn’t seen before,” Khosroshahin says. “And I haven’t either. It’s out of character for both of us.”
It’s the first time in Khosroshahin’s five-year tenure with USC that his squad will sit out the postseason, and the first time since 2004 that a Khosroshahin-coached team will not be seen in the NCAA tournament. Perhaps most shockingly, it’s the program’s first losing season since 1992.

Soccer is deeply entrenched into Khosroshahin’s background.
A native of Iran, Khosroshahin says when he moved to Logan, Utah, at age six, he knew two phrases in English: “hello” and “shut up.”
“You aren’t going to make any friends saying just ‘hello’ and ‘shut up’ to people,” Khosroshahin said with a laugh. “And I needed to make some friends. Soccer was the thing that allowed me to be accepted.”
Khosroshahin played competitively at Cal State Los Angeles for coach Leo Cuéllar, a man Khosroshahin speaks of with incredible reverence.
“Leo has been my biggest mentor, my teacher, my father, my big brother,” Khosroshahin said. “He’s been everything in my career for me. He saw something in me as a coach. As soon as I finished playing for him, he hired me. Right out of school.”
After a short time under Cuéllar, Cal State Fullerton called and offered him a job as an assistant.
“It was for a pay cut, they had no benefits. I was gonna turn the position down,” Khosroshahin said. “And I went and I spoke with Leo and told him I got this offer. I felt like I had so much more to learn from him. But when I told him that Fullerton had called, he said, ‘You have to go.’”
It caught him by surprise.
“My first reaction was, ‘What have I done wrong?’” Khosroshahin said. “But he said, ‘Ali, this is an opportunity you can’t pass.’ It was jumping from Division-II to Division-I. So I went.”
Khosroshahin was quickly put in charge of the women’s program at Fullerton, and in 2001 took the program to the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history.
The program progressed year-by-year, and in 2005, Fullerton knocked off USC in the second round of the NCAA tournament.
“I remember looking across the field and looking at their players,” Khosroshahin said. “And just thinking, ‘Wow, give me a chance with those players. Let me show what I can really do.’ I remember that vividly.”
Down 1-0 at halftime, the Titans scored three goals in the second half to advance to the Sweet 16.
“It was, at that point, one of the highlights of my coaching career, to beat USC,” Khosroshahin said.
—
His whole career, Khosroshahin had been the little man: David, forced to deal with Goliaths like USC.
“But I felt like we had done everything we could do [at Fullerton],” Khosroshahin said. “And for whatever reason I checked ’SC’s website after the season was over and I saw the position was open. I picked up the phone and left a message.”
When Khosroshahin found out he got the job, he said he fell down to his knees while on the phone with former associate athletic director Steve Lopes, unable to control himself.
“And then we came in here in 2007 and did something special,” Khosroshahin said with a hint of nostalgia.
The Women of Troy won the national championship in 2007, playing five of their six games on the road.
Khosroshahin talks quite fondly of how his team went to watch the West Virginia men’s team in their tournament game before a scheduled Elite Eight matchup against the Mountaineers’ women’s team.
“We get to the stadium, in all our USC gear, and everyone starts booing us,” Khosroshahin recalls. “And it was the coolest feeling.”
That is Ali Khosroshahin in a nutshell. He loves competition. He thrives off of it. After USC went up 2-0 in the national championship game over Florida State, he said he was yelling louder than anyone in the stadium. Not cheering, but yelling — at his players.
“I wasn’t about to let anyone think the game was over,” he said.
Khosroshahin yells a lot when he coaches. How he is not completely hoarse at the end of games is a great mystery. But he is not yelling at his players. He is yelling to them.
“One of the biggest misconceptions of me is that my passion for the game comes across as anger,” Khosroshahin says. “When I’m yelling on the sideline, I’m teaching. My players hear information.”
That’s how Khosroshahin describes himself as a coach: “a teacher.”
“Coaching has always been a part of what I do,” Khosroshahin says. “I was coaching high school while I was playing at Fullerton. For whatever reason, the kids have always seemed to listen to me.”
But even as a teacher, this season’s trials have taught him plenty.
“Life is about experiences,” Khosroshahin reflects. “It’s about what you do with those experiences and how you react to them.”
The same could be said for soccer.
 
 
Just think if the Coach wasn’t so committed where the program would be today. You win the national title your first year with players mainly Rodriguez and Hughes both seniors who were Parade AA from the previous coaching regime and now this four years later. One last chance to get back on track next year or thanks for the memory.

Ra Ra Riot
Remember last year’s Welcome Week concert? Of course you do, given that indie up-and-comers Ra Ra Riot left a lasting impression.
The band comprises an eclectic mix of instruments including a cellist and violinist among the tried and true bassist, guitarist and vocalist, has been on the rise since its 2010 Coachella performance as well as the incorporation of its song, “Can You Tell,” in The Last Song soundtrack.
Other notable yet underrated tracks include “Ghost Under Rocks,” “Too Dramatic” and “Dying is Fine.” With its endearingly frenetic energy and cute lyrics of love and loss, this charismatic and eclectic group is sure to win you over if it hasn’t already.
Ra Ra Riot will perform at the El Rey Theatre Thursday at 7 p.m. with tickets, available on Ticketmaster per usual, starting at $20.
Be sure to get your indie fill. You want to be able to say you saw Ra Ra Riot before the band made it big.
Vigil
This weekend is the perfect opportunity to embrace your inner thespian.
The dark comedy Vigil, starring Oscar-winning actors Olympia Dukakis and Marco Barricelli, follows the story of a man, Kemp, who travels to see his aunt Grace after 30 years of separation.
Kemp is eagerly waiting for Grace to die — but the problem is, she won’t die fast enough.
The pair tackles issues of human compassion and mortality, all with the feeling of good, dark humor and, of course, solid acting.
Vigil will be playing at the Ahmanson Theatre through Dec. 18 with tickets beginning at $30 on the Ahmanson website.
This weekend, why don’t you give your tried and true routine of video games and movies a break, and head back to the basics — it’s time we all enjoyed a delightful night at the theater.
Into the Abyss
The inner psyche of a killer — we don’t want to admit it, but the workings of psychotic felons fascinate us.
Thus comes Into the Abyss, a foreboding yet insightful investigation into the triple homicide case in Conroe, Texas, that delves into the logic behind the murders and the death penalty alike.
This Saturday, filmmaker Werner Herzog, director of Grizzly Man and Cave of Forgotten Dreams, will make an appearance at The Landmark Theatre for the 7:20 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. showings of the film.
Herzog himself describes the film as “a gaze into the abyss of the human soul.”
If you’re a fan of the chilling In Cold Blood, then Into the Abyss is sure to please. Here’s looking to a dark and ominous weekend.
‘Naked Hollywood: Weegee in Los Angeles’
Sex appeal, naked mannequins, celebrities, strippers and costume shops: What better way to describe the work of acclaimed tabloid photographer Weegee?
After leaving New York City in 1947, Weegee transferred his attention to sex, stars and Los Angeles; this exhibition serves as a testament to the scandalous and noteworthy subjects that caught Weegee’s attention.
This L.A. focus allows “Naked Hollywood: Weegee in Los Angeles” to serve as the perfect fit for the Getty’s massive art initiative, “Pacific Standard Time,” which brings more than 60 art institutions together to tell the story of the rise of the L.A. art scene in addition to its current state.
As USC students, and cultured individuals at that, we owe it to ourselves to be educated on the previous, current and progressive L.A. aesthetic. With a subject as intriguing as the infamously scandalous Hollywood and all it encompasses, you practically don’t have a choice in the matter.
“Naked Hollywood: Weegee in Los Angeles” will be on display at MOCA beginning Sunday and running through Feb. 27.

Nathan Lang started his career as a broadcast journalist. After interviewing people on the street and getting a feel for what it was like to peer into the minds of strangers, he became inspired.
“Five years ago, I was thinking to myself, ‘What was this image of God,’” Lang said. “What does he look like and what does he look like to others?”
Thinking inside the box · Filmmaker Nathan Lang put interview boxes on street corners around the country to film his latest project God in the Box. In the documentary, passersby elucidate their conceptions of God and divinity, exploring a profound and sometimes controversial topic. - Photo courtesy of K.O. PR
It’s a controversial question to ask. Some don’t believe in God, some staunchly believe in a God and others are still grappling with their conception of God.
Though Lang’s film God in the Box has no permanent release date, Lang’s film premieres Thursday at 8 p.m. at the ArcLight Hollywood. It was an official selection of the Heartland Film Festival and was voted as one of the 10 films selected to screen at the ArcLight Documentary Film Festival thanks to heavy votes from fans on the film’s YouTube trailer.
Stumbling randomly upon a situation that makes you face your views on an abstract belief can be pretty intimidating, but for Lang, that’s what fueled the film.
“Peering inside the mind’s eyes, I started getting these visions of this box in the streets of New York City and that was the inspiration,” Lang said.
Put yourself in that situation. Imagine stumbling upon a box bigger than a photo booth in the middle of the street, walking into the box and being completely alone with your thoughts as you search your mind for the answer to the question of what God means and looks like to you.
That’s exactly what Lang created for hundreds of random individuals when he put his large box on street corners all over the country.
Lang was intrigued by the idea that there was a group of people  rarely seen on television — the religious middle — and wanted to find a way to tell their stories.
“When you look at religious news today, you tend to see extremists,” Lang said. “The news tends to [publicize] anti-abortionists, but what you don’t see is all these incredible populations of people in the middle who are moderate and not extremists and have very reasonable ideas in their heads about what God means to them.”
Lang shows viewers a wide range of beliefs in the film that come to represent the enormity of the question itself.
It’s Lang’s first film and he managed to make it on what he called a “microbudget”: He partnered with Nick Calderone, Troy Browder and Jim Manley, all former journalists and current video producers, and used money out of his own pocket to set up a box in which people would give answers about what God meant to them on film.
Though Lang won’t reveal too much about his own religious views for fear of spoiling the film, he said seeing what others thought was truly fascinating.
“We explore the really abstract people who see God in ways that haven’t been pictured in art or literature,” Lang said. “Some see it as abstract descriptions like energy or love … there are people who are spiritual people, but don’t necessarily believe in the description of God that they’ve been taught in their religion.”
Lang stressed he’s not looking to challenge any religious institutions with this film, or take one side over the other. What he’s hoping to do is start a conversation that delves into the true feelings people are often afraid to share.
“There are so many of us with questions in the [religious] middle that we find it comforting to see [experts] who say it’s ok to have questions,” Lang said. “To be able to experience these feelings and explore these questions of God and not feel cornered about is really one of the great characteristics of the film.”

It’s hard to miss the entrance to the new “it” restaurant in West Hollywood. The cars in line for the valet stretch for blocks down Santa Monica Boulevard. The wait for a table inside the restaurant is more than an hour.
It’s called Mercato di Vetro, and it’s an Italian food lover’s heaven.
A project of famous L.A. hospitality group sbe (known for Katsuya and Gladstones), Mercato di Vetro opened its doors Oct. 3 and has been packed ever since.
The contemporary-looking restaurant spans two levels and includes four kitchens — one for antipasti, cheese and charcuterie, another with a wood-burning oven for pizza and a pasta-making station, another for cocktails and a final traditional restaurant kitchen for composed dishes.
The design feels rustic yet modern, with plenty of dark cherry wood and crisp white marble. Though the space is large, it’s divided into sections by walls of wine bottles that stretch from floor to ceiling.
With an eager staff, service is prompt and attentive. Once seated, an iPad to be used as a drink menu is brought to the table. Patrons are able to flick through a wide array of wines and an assortment of unusual cocktails, including pomegranate martinis and Sex on the Beach.
The vast menu has a range of Italian classics, from the Margherita pizza to a less traditional raw fish bar. With a wide variety, it’s safe to assume every diner can find a dish they’ll like. Servers suggest you read the menu in a clockwise motion, starting with the antipasti selection and moving toward the raw bar, salads, meat, fish, pasta and pizza. The idea behind the menu is to encourage groups to order a variety of dishes from each section to share among one another.
Starters include hen of the woods with aioli and parmesan, squash blossoms, farro salad and prosciutto with burrata. Contrary to its name, hen of the woods does not include any element of poultry. In fact, the dish presents a wild mushroom commonly found in the woods — hence the creative name. The mushroom dish is the most memorable starter. Served with a garlicky-mayonnaise sauce and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese, the appetizer literally melts in your mouth.
The squash blossoms resemble vegetables as much as french fries do. The battered and deep fried squash tastes nothing like a healthy vegetable, and is served with a tangy yogurt sauce — it’s sure to surprise anyone.
The Farro salad is the least impressive of the bunch. The farro salad is served cold over roasted vegetables and sits on top of a bed of lettuce soaked in oil.
The final appetizer is the prosciutto with burrata. From the small plates menu, the dish is tiny, but packed with full flavors. Though the dish isn’t overly complex, the prosciutto is delicious. The creamy burrata serves as the perfect balance to the salty meat.
With four kitchens, the food tends to arrive at haphazard moments rather than as regularly timed courses, and the extensive dinner menu might be overwhelming to some, but the restaurant’s standout dishes — tomato ricotta pizza, a four-cheese pizza and scallops with risotto — make everything worthwhile.
All three meals are classic Italian dishes with no surprises. The scallops are perfectly cooked and cut like butter, far from the all-too-common rubber consistency. They are served over creamy ricotta cheese and topped with brown butter. Though not the largest of portions (a mere three scallops), all of the varying flavors mesh perfectly, creating a delicious entrée.
The pizzas come directly from the wood-burning oven with their cheeses still bubbling. Both pizzas, although very different from one another, do not disappoint. The four-cheese pizza consists of valdeon, mozzarella, talegglo and parmesan, combining four distinct flavors into one delicious concoction.
The tomato ricotta pizza is topped with huge slices of fresh tomato, parmesan cheese and balsamic vinegar. The rectangular pizzas are perfect for sharing — with large portions and rich ingredients, they are nearly impossible to finish alone.
The dessert menu finishes with a few traditional Italian delicacies, including gelato and cannolis, paired with American favorites, such as hot fudge brownies served with vanilla ice cream.
For those with a soft spot for sweets, the best dessert dish is the bombolone. The Tuscan treasure consists of fried dough filled with warm custard.
Mercato di Vetro has managed to combine affordable prices with delicious food — something uncommon in Los Angeles. And with its additional retail area, which showcases extra-virgin olive oil, jarred pasta sauces, handmade pasta and various cured products, customers are able to enjoy Mercato di Vetro’s flavors at home.
 
Mercato di Vetro is located at 9077 Santa Monica Blvd. in West Hollywood.

Sometimes art involves a little more than just painting on canvas and hoping to get displayed in a gallery.
For the Bulgarian-born artist Christo, art means stretching 5.9 miles of fabric in suspended panels over 42 miles of the Arkansas River in Colorado. Recently approved by United States federal regulators and slated for completion in 2014, Christo’s latest project, “Over the River,” has stirred up controversy from environmental groups and neighboring communities.

Though the project might have been approved, more permits are still required, and not all residents are convinced Christo’s work of art deserves federal approval. Other organizations, such as Rags Over the Arkansas River, have complained regulators were swayed by ideas such as “artistic vision” and are not taking other factors into consideration. Some organizations, such as the Colorado Wildlife Commission, are concerned about the well-being of animal populations in the area, especially bighorn sheep.
Such controversy is the nature of environmental art, a genre in which artists either shape nature or use its resources for their pieces — often with divisive results.
Environmental art has transformed throughout the years, becoming more complex as artists got more creative with their visual interpretations. The genre came to fruition in the ’60s when artists were looking to push audiences to pay more attention to their surroundings and to view them in a different light.
Artist Walter de Maria, for instance, took it upon himself in 1977 to fill up a New York room with dirt. “The New York Earth Room,” which was 22 inches and 250 cubic yards of earth, stressed the viewer’s need to be in tune with nature.
More recently, there has been much buzz about LACMA’s upcoming exhibition “Levitated Mass,” a monumental Michael Heizer piece, which consists of a 340-ton boulder placed in a gap in the ground at LACMA. Heizer’s is obviously no ordinary-sized rock. With this piece, as with De Maria’s, it’s not so much about invading nature as it is about nature invading the traditional art space.
Yet Heizer and De Maria’s pieces, which incorporate elements of nature, are philosophically separate from Christo’s, which looks to use the outdoors as a canvas. The wide range of interpretation raises an interesting fact about nature art: It’s still mostly undefined. Each artist will continue to bring his or her own vision to the genre.
Still, though the ’60s environmental art movement might seem outdated today, there’s something about it that’s lacking from Christo’s controversial piece. Works like “Spiral Jetty,” a seminal example of environmental art created by Robert Smithson, evokes something that “Over the River” perhaps cannot.
Smithson’s work is a stunning, glittering 1,500 foot spiral, formed using rocks over the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Smithson’s piece caused a bit of an uproar because it involved using bulldozers, which many felt were too invasive toward the landscape’s tranquility. But today, Smithson’s work is intact and integrated into its environment, disappearing when the water level rises.
Here is where Christo’s work is different: The segmented pieces of fabric will no doubt look beautiful against the landscape, but the piece far from smoothly meshes with its surroundings.
If “Over the River” is like other Christo pieces, it will stay at the site for a limited time, while “Spiral Jetty” still remains on the lake and is open for the public to visit. “Spiral Jetty” has become a part of nature, showcasing its beauty for others to appreciate. “Over the River,” on the other hand, creates an aesthetically pleasing piece but doesn’t showcase nature’s beauty to its fullest.
Similarly, “Levitated Mass,” which will likely only stay at LACMA for a limited amount of time, exists as an exhibition within a museum with works from a variety of time periods and cultures. “Spiral Jetty,” on the other hand, exists in its own space. While “Levitated Mass” and “Over the River” are impressive in their magnanimity, “Spiral Jetty” manages to become one with nature in a way those pieces cannot.
Environmental artists will have to continue to grapple with the question of whether they should manipulate nature, as Christo does, or mesh with it, a la Smithson’s “Spiral Jetty.” There will always be something particularly magical about a piece that uses nature practically as its medium to become a permanent fixture.
The controversy caused by “Over the River” is far from over, and with it the questions and challenges of environmental art will keep growing. But “Spiral Jetty” and similar examples of environmental art prove something magical can occur within the genre of natural art.

Hi,
Thanks for your article we’re going to add to our international press review, here : http://obsart.blogspot.com
But two points are not very debatable:
1- “Still, though the ’60s environmental art movement might seem outdated today” Outdated ? We don’t have the same news…
2- “Similarly, “Levitated Mass,” which will likely only stay at LACMA for a limited amount of time” We also don’t have the same news… LACMA announcement is clear, Levitated Mass will be a permanent exhibition, and according to the several months of schedule difficulties and so on, The Rock is there for a very long time !
All the best

A sea of hipsters, dressed in an assortment of flannels and thrift store Christmas sweaters, flocked to the Vista Theatre for the holy trinity of underrated artistic geniuses: indie sensation Sufjan Stevens, alternative-folk artist Raymond Raposa and documentary-filmmaker Kaleo La Belle.
Live duet · Sufjan Stevens (left) and Raymond Raposa joined Kaleo La Belle (not pictured) for a screening and live performance of Beyond This Place Tuesday at Hollywood’s Vista Theatre. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
The trio came together Tuesday night for a screening of La Belle’s emotive 2010 documentary, Beyond This Place, which investigates La Belle’s relationship, or lack thereof, with his free-spirited father, Cloud Rock. The documentary was accompanied by folk talents Raposa and Stevens live rendition of the film’s subtle yet powerful score.
Coon-skin caps, mismatched vintage styles and nonchalant attitudes could not hide the audience’s excitement; beneath the cool exteriors of this alternative audience existed a riling anticipation, a need for the two empty seats flanking the front of the stage to be taken by Stevens and Raposa and for the burgundy curtains to open and reveal the film.
Calm demeanor and serious artistic attitudes in tow, Stevens and Raposa took their places as accompanists to embark alongside the emotional journey of father and son reconnecting.
What began as a competition between the film and live score vying for the audience’s attention quickly melded into one cohesive experience, allowing the thought-provoking themes of the story and the present, twangy and folk-infused string instruments to enrapture viewers and listeners.
Though the documentary intrigues viewers, it is the film’s music that heightens the experience and reinforces the film’s emotional impact.
As a prime example, psychedelic guitar rifts perfectly accompany nature-infused camera shots and descriptions of being high on mushrooms. Visuals and instrumentals work together as a collective force, enabling the viewer to become mesmerized by the film and forget that the musical duo is even in the room.
For one to forget they were sitting 20 feet away from Sufjan Stevens was a major feat; the artistic medium clearly finds its effective middle ground.
With Stevens and Raposa now part of the film and not some separate and distracting musical entity, Beyond This Place shaped itself as its own noteworthy film. It tackles issues of childhood abandonment and the longing for a drug abusing, hippie father figure to fulfill years of expectations over the course of an extensive biking and camping trip.
In a question and answer session after the screening, La Belle explained his motivation for taking on such a heavy emotional burden, saying, “I approached this project as a filmmaker. I recognized my relationship with my father as a good story.”
But the film’s story is a little more personal than that.
The film delves into the meaning of fatherhood and its expectations.
“Pre-psychedelics, Cloud Rock’s name was Gordon,” La Belle notes. “What would Gordon have been like as a father?”
Moreover, one of Cloud Rock’s friends questions the meaning of genetics and “how much of you is your dad?”
From this, the audience can gather that Beyond This Place is an emotional confession for La Belle, an exploration into the inner psyche of a seemingly oblivious father and the effects of his father’s preference for a free-spirited lifestyle.
La Belle made it clear the film is not meant as a therapy session.
“I always wanted to connect with my father,” La Belle said. “It wasn’t really though until I became a father myself. Right at that moment it was like magic.”
La Belle’s motivations aside, Beyond This Place pulls at heartstrings as it makes viewers question paternal expectations, the bond between father and son and typical conceptions of love. These themes come together full force through the subtleties of the banjo, emotionally driven organ accompaniment and beautifully simple vocals, used only when needed at the beginning and end of the documentary feature.
“What is this f–king love I feel for Cloud Rock?” La Belle bluntly says in the film. “I would love to be angry with him but I’m not.”
We all have a lot to learn from La Belle’s compassion and understanding. The meaning of La Belle’s moral is heightened through the guise of the unique mixture of artistic media in this emotionally striking musical and cinematic event.

“Banks prey on students just like us.”
That’s what Gabe Albarian, a graduate student at the USC Marshall School of Business and author of Financial Swagger, is trying to tell students. On Nov. 8 at 7:00 p.m., Albarian gave a presentation that spelled out how undergraduates should take care of their financial education and learning while avoiding debt and credit card fees.
“My inspiration, in a nutshell, are the same mistakes I made as an undergraduate,” Albarian said. “It’s my trials and tribulations with financial education, and we had [to] commit our own mistakes.”
Financial Swagger, which was completed in July, goes through basic aspects of finance in order to introduce students to “practical personal finance,” according to Albarian. The book is intended for ages 18 to 30, and topics include basic banking, credit scores, credit history report, student loans, basic investing tips and jobs.
“Most of the popular speakers focus on people who are already in debt,” Albarian said. “I want for students to avoid debt at all.”
The lecture was put on by the Academic Culture Assembly (ACA) and also included a talk by speaker Gina Rudan, author of Practical Genius and president of Geniune Insights Inc. Called Practical Swagger, it was co-hosted by the Program Board’s Speaker’s Committee.
“We want students to be financially sound while successful,” Juan Espinoza, the Speakers director and a senior majoring in communications and international relations, said. “It’s about the small details of finance and innovative ideas.”

On the first day of the early signing period, USC basketball coach Kevin O’Neill announced he received signed National Letters of Intent from two players, guard J.T. Terrell and forward Strahinja Gavrilovic.
The 6-foot-3 Terrell, who attends Peninsula Junior College in Washington, was the No. 1 junior college player in America by Swannys Roundball Review.
As a freshman, Terrell played at Wake Forest, averaging 11.1 points, which was second on the team and fifth among Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) freshman. He also shot 35.7 percent from beyond the arc.
“J.T. is a dynamic scorer that will be able to impact our team offensively next year,” O’Neill said in a statement. “He’s as talented a perimeter player as I’ve coached in college.”
Gavrilovic, a 6-foot-8 forward from Serbia, is now in the United States and will play his senior year at La Jolla Prep (Calif.). He played with the Serbian U-18 team at the European Championships, and his father, Zoran, played professionally in Europe for more than a decade.
“Strahinja is a very skilled forward who has the ability to use both hands and score inside and outside,” O’Neill said. “Once he adjusts to the college game, we expect him to have a key role in our future.”
Freshman guard Danilo Dragovic is also from Serbia.
The Trojans could still add other players in the fall or spring signing periods.
Next season, transfer forwards Ari Stewart and Eric Wise will also be eligible to play for USC, after practicing with the team this season.
Stewart, a teammate of Terrell’s at Wake Forest, averaged 8.5 points per game as a sophomore with the Demon Deacons.
Wise, who comes from UC Irvine, averaged 16.3 points and a team-high 8.1 rebounds per game as a junior.
The Trojans open the 2011-2012 season at home on Friday against CS Northridge at 8:00 p.m.

The last two times USC has met Washington on the gridiron, things did not end well for the Trojans. Former USC coordinators and current Washington coaches Steve Sarkisian and Nick Holt have gotten the better of the Trojans two straight years, notching a 16-13 win in Seattle in 2009 and a 32-31 victory in Los Angeles a year ago. USC will look to right the ship this Saturday against the Huskies, but this task will not be an easy one to achieve.
Washington is led by redshirt sophomore quarterback Keith Price. In his first season as the Huskies signal caller, Price has exceeded all expectations. The Compton, Calif. native is ranked 14th nationally in passing efficiency with a rating of 155.97.
This score, which is the NCAA equivalent of the NFL’s passer rating, ranks Price above some of America’s most highly touted quarterbacks including Oklahoma’s Landry Jones, Clemson’s Tajh Boyd and, Matt Barkley of USC. The Trojans’ secondary will certainly have their work cut out for them against one of the nation’s best on Saturday.
As is the case against most opponents, USC should have the edge on the offensive side of the ball. Matt Barkley and company should have a field day against the 113th ranked Husky pass defense. Washington is yielding 283 yards through the air per game, and Matt Barkley should be able to continue his special connection with Robert Woods and Marqise Lee.
Look for another shootout at the Coliseum this Saturday with two of the nation’s best quarterbacks on display. It’s Barkley vs. Price, Kiffin vs. Sarkisian — what more could you ask for?

In a network-savvy move, the USC Admissions Office took its question-and-answer session online from 12:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. Wednesday. The Twitter-based information session allowed interested applicants and families to sit in on an admissions answer session remotely, as officers tweeted updates.
From 1:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m., the floor belonged to those remote Twitter users, who were able to ask the admissions officers questions by posting tweets with the hashtag #admitusc.
The USC Admissions Office answered questions on topics ranging from scholarship application deadlines to required test scores. By using Twitter as a forum, the office allowed participants to have their questions answered in real-time by a reputable source. Other users, such as the Los Angeles Teenshop, a non-profit organization that works to empower teenage girls, were able to retweet USC’s admissions information to their followers.
Many non-applicants chimed in as well, posting encouraging tweets such as “So many tweets from @USCedu for #admitusc! Coming to USC was by far the best decision I ever made :-) Fight On Future Trojans! Good Luck!,” from junior Cassie Bussing. One of the most retweeted messages was undoubtedly “@USCedu: The USC experience doesn’t end when you graduate. We have a strong Trojan Family #admitusc.”
Twitter allows the Admissions Office to reach a wider applicant base, and also permits them to supply important information, such as links to admissions counselors, in a direct manner. This is one of the first times the university has used social media in this manner, and it boasts a number of advantages in regards to accessibility of information. With time, perhaps all of USC’s information sessions will be broadcast on Twitter and allow user interaction.

A few songs that you might or might not have heard on the radio in the last year: “Till the World Ends,” “Blow,” “Price Tag,” “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)” and basically every other Katy Perry hit to dominate airplay.
So what do these songs have in common? They are all mainstream, pop, Top 40 material for sure, but they also all share the same producer.
Lukasz Gottwald, better known by his production name Dr. Luke, has been creating those massive radio hits we all love and grow to hate since he gained mainstream exposure on Kelly Clarkson’s “Since U Been Gone” and “Behind These Hazel Eyes.”
Besides being the producer of Katy Perry’s newest No.1-contending single “The One That Got Away,” Dr. Luke is also in the news due to a contract instituted between the producer and Sony/BMG.
In Sony’s quest to become the largest, most powerful record company of them all, the firm has offered Gottwald his own label under the Sony umbrella, Kemosabe Records. This wold essentially render Gottwald an in-house producer for the company, a practice that has generally been left by the wayside these days as artists like to explore different producers and sounds.
But here’s the kicker — Dr. Luke will only be allowed to produce Sony artists.
So, what’s the big deal?
There’s no issue for Ke$ha, a Dr. Luke favorite, since she falls in the Sony domain. Even Beyonce may be able to tap into Gottwald’s radio magic — although it seems she’s happy staying on the funkier side of pop music.
Looking at Katy Perry’s latest record, Teenage Dream, Gottwald produced five of the six singles on the album. However, Perry is signed under Capitol Records, a division of EMI. She will no longer be able to seek the services of Dr. Luke, whom, for better or worse, molded her into the massive superstar that she is now. Can she survive without her hit-maker?

Voters in Mississippi struck down the controversial “personhood” ballot initiative Nov. 8, which would have effectively banned abortion in all cases including incest and rape, among other forms of birth control.
Initiative 26 would have amended the state constitution to define “personhood” at the moment an egg is fertilized, making it illegal to harm or prohibit the implantation of that egg. This would include some forms of birth control — such as the IUD —that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a women’s uterus, and fertility treatments that involve implanting fertilized eggs in hopes of creating a pregnancy.
The amendment was defeated 58 percent to 42 percent by the end of the day, coming as a surprise to many who believed the measure would pass in one of the nation’s most conservative and religious states.
“Even in a conservative state, tonight’s vote reaffirms that people do not want government intruding in personal decisions best made by a woman, her family and her doctor,” the ACLU’s Jennifer Dalven said in a prepared statement Tuesday night.
Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour declined to endorse the measure, calling it too ambiguous.
If passed, the measure would have faced federal opposition in light of the long-standing Roe v. Wade case.
Similar attempts at banning abortion by declaring early “personhood” were defeated in Colorado in both 2008 and 2010, but a handful of states are planning on putting this issue on their ballots in the next election cycle.
“This is the third time an amendment like this has failed. Legislators around the country should listen to the voters of Mississippi and stop playing politics with women’s health,” Davlen said.

Programs must publicize 
Karla Chavez and Mellissa Linton’s “Free concerts deserve greater publicity” (Nov. 7) diagnoses one of USC’s most unfortunate cultural ailments: Most students attend very few musical events on campus besides Program Board’s “big three.”
That the average $5 house party — bound as it is these days to be broken up promptly at midnight — is much more widely attended than any free concert is unfortunate.
The benefits of all-you-can-drink jungle juice aside, our community would benefit from a little more “cultural enrichment,” to use Chavez and Linton’s words.
But I disagree with the columnists’ argument that the university should promote free events on campus.
In reality, it is not the university but student organizations, including USG’s Program Board, that put on the shows and should promote them.
Yet, Chavez and Linton’s point demonstrates that the organizations that host concerts and the students who want to see them are not connecting.
I’m the Music Director at KXSC, the student radio station, which hosts regular concerts on and off campus. The station hosts a show every Friday at 1 p.m. in Tommy’s Place in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center that is free and open to the public and broadcasts over the air. KXSC is also preparing to put on its fourth annual music festival next semester.
Last year’s free KXSC Fest, which featured Flying Lotus, Abe Vigoda and Puro Instinct, among others, was our best-attended event in recent memory, but unfortunately, most of the visitors were not USC students. The station also hosts other events, like the free screening of the new film Nirvana: Live at the Paramount on Wednesday.
That Chavez and Linton did not come across KXSC in their research for Tuesday’s article is proof that we have not managed to reach the student body as well as we want to, and we’ve been working hard lately to change that.
I would also like to take this moment on the soap box to mention a university policy that harms a student organization’s ability to publicize themselves: the systematic removal of bulletin boards for the purpose of campus beautification. The International Plaza by the campus center is the most heavily trafficked area of campus, but there is not a single place to post flyers or other community messages.
Thanks to Chavez and Linton for bringing this issue forward. We hope to see them and many other students at our festival next semester.

Last Sunday, USC students, faculty and community members had the unique privilege of spending “An Evening with Luis Moreno-Ocampo.”
The event, hosted by the Gould School of Law and School of Cinematic Arts, featured a conversation between Ocampo, prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, and several notable individuals connected to USC who have been involved in campaigns to end genocide and other human rights abuses.
Ocampo and his fellow participants spoke of world issues of the highest caliber, of great horrors and great triumphs and of fascinating activist initiatives the average listener likely never considers.
One of the most prevalent topics is how media technology, combined with the best creative talent, could effect enormous change in how human rights advocacy is conducted and in resolution of the issues.
Implicit in this discussion was an appeal to the creative community at USC: Take notice of these problems, use your abilities and make a change. Our institution desperately needs to respond to that appeal.
Because USC boasts some of the world’s best programs in creative media, it has an obligation to live up to that standard. USC students and alumni tend to do pretty well in this arena. Sometimes, however, we fall short when it comes to extending compassion to a suffering global community.
This is not for lack of a role to play. Human rights campaigns and other non-profit efforts often desperately need creative people to back them up. A brilliant organizing mind can only go so far without an effective means of gaining support from the community.
There is a general lack of interest within the student body when it comes to human rights issues. Students are not necessarily quick to respond to statistics about rape, famine, poverty and child soldiers, no matter how staggering they might be, without an emotionally impacting message. They can’t simply be urged to action; they have to be driven to take it. And that’s where the USC community can come in.
USC recently added minors in both human rights and peace and conflict studies. Despite their limited following nationwide, these fields are both very legitimate and very relevant to the crises our nation and world face every day.
The university has taken appropriate action in these fields, but should expand minors to majors and work their themes into other programs of study to open doors for students and faculty alike. USC students can play a even more significant humanitarian role. They can respond to Ocampo’s petition by becoming active community members and reaching out to those who need help.
The student body should be more aware of the world’s most pressing issues. Students must also recognize how the resources and expertise we gain as students at USC can help us bring about positive global change.
Jedidiah Jenkins, a USC alumnus and  director of ideology for the Southern California-based activist organization Invisible Children, was among the guests at Sunday’s event. Invisible Children attempts to use film, creativity and social action to end the atrocities and use of child soldiers in the Ugandan conflict — a civil conflict where a rebel army is treating Ugandans just as poorly, if not moreso, than their government is.
USC students are more than capable of creating initiatives just like Jenkins’ now world-renowned organization. Our own busy and important lives can often get in the way. It doesn’t take much, however, to make a community like ours a little more globally conscious.
Consider making a documentary about genocide for your summer film project or investigate the growing media opportunities with non-profit organizations. With the talent and creative drive we have at USC, there is absolutely no reason for USC not to put itself at the forefront of a new generation of activist efforts.

Have you ever had a question you didn’t want to voice aloud?
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
I’m not talking about that time you fell asleep in class and had to ask your professor to repeat something obvious. I’m talking about questions that betray personal information; questions that no one in your vicinity could answer; questions that unearth taboos.
You can always Google the answer.
The Internet is vast enough to host venues for every question imaginable, no matter how serious or banal. People go on Yahoo! Answers to ask about everything from sports to relationship advice. Some people send their questions to advice bloggers with impressive followings. As a high school senior, I went on College Confidential — a popular forum for students — to pick a USC dorm.
The worth of these answers, however, depends on the kinds of questions being asked. Online advice isn’t always credible, but its lack of credibility doesn’t prevent it from being useful.
The Internet is a blessing for people who have trouble with social norms. A few decades ago, these same people had few outlets to express themselves.
Consider the example of a teenager questioning his sexuality in a homophobic environment. Online, a question like “What’s wrong with me?” can be answered by bigots — but people with tolerant mindsets can also weigh in. Because anyone with an Internet connection can respond, online questions reveal diverse outlooks. They present people who’ve been exposed to just one line of thinking with the option to view things differently.
The Internet, however, is no replacement for human contact. That confused teenager could probably use a supportive friend or mentor. But the Internet is better than nothing; it empowers people by letting them know they aren’t alone.
When questions involve hard facts, however, online answers become trickier. Internet anonymity makes it tough to evaluate people’s credentials. Many educators fear that asking a question online means opening yourself up to a slew of faulty information.
One Slate article, for example, looked at this Yahoo! Answers question: “What beliefs and customs did many of the Native Americans have in common?” The answer that was chosen as best is “American pie.” It’s hard not to look at that thread and lose a little faith in the Internet.
Nevertheless, there’s nothing inherently bad about having alternatives to expert opinions. Experts often have difficulty translating their knowledge to laypeople.
Who would you rather have tell you how to fix a minor problem with your laptop: a seasoned techie or an average person who’s faced the exact same problem? The Internet makes it easy to take the latter option.
In addition, many people suffer from some variation of a supremacy complex where many consider answers on the Internet to be factual. Their belief in their correctness prevents them from really considering alternatives.
A certain amount of skepticism toward expert opinions is healthy. It’s why people turn to Google when they’re sick. Though we’re taught that conventional medicine is completely dependable, the reality is far less comforting. Doctors do fail. The Internet gives people access to a range of alternative cures.
A problem arises when skepticism turns into unwavering belief in a random comment on the Internet.  It’s the idea that drives the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence: Many great solutions come from groups of random individuals working together.
Collective intelligence also harnesses the power of specific knowledge. Doctors go through years of training, but a 50-year-old woman in Alabama might share your weird, inexplicable allergy. The Internet allows you to talk to her.
In many ways, typing a question into Google is the equivalent of yelling into a crowd and expecting a coherent response. People contradict each other, and the loudest people don’t always make sense.
You have to know what you’re looking for.

Try this one: “How many people, and what kinds (Jews, others) were REALLY killed in the H0locaust, by whom, when, why, where, and by what means?”
If you fail rapidly to express full acceptance of the first, loudest, and most-frequent answer (starting with 6 million Jews), you WILL be sorry you asked this question, or even appeared to hear the “wrong” answers.
You are NOT to question the loudest answer to THIS question, which has been shouted, with increasing volume and vehemence, for over 60 years now.
Maya, I MUST say your column is VERY thought-provoking. Eloquent, too!
