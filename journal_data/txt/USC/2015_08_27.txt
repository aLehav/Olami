A new poll by Policy Analysis for California Education and the Rossier School of Education indicated that 63 percent of voters favor of extending Proposition 30 to bring more money to public schools. The proposition is set to expire at the end of 2016.
By extending Prop. 30, voters would be agreeing to a tax increase for those with high incomes, a general sales tax increase or possibly both.
According to the polls, only 28 percent of voters oppose a tax increase.
The last time Prop. 30 was modified, it resulted in a quarter-cent tax increase for the state as well as a higher personal income tax for those with incomes larger than $250,000 a year. All tax increases funded public schools and government programs.
Rossier Dean Karen Gallagher said the poll clearly shows that Californians are not opposed to funding public schools with taxes.
“Since the inception of this poll in 2012, we have identified valuable trends that not only reflect the opinions of the state’s voters, but also influence policymakers in Sacramento,” Gallagher said in a statement released by USC News. “The latest results indicate a growing confidence in our public school system as voters are clearly willing to provide greater financial support to education.”
According to USC News, the amount of voters who believe public schools have gotten better has increased by 10 percent to 17 percent in the last three years.
David Plank, executive director of PACE, said residents are happy with the changes, but expect more to come.
“Voters are clearly not satisfied with the State of California’s public education system, but they are beginning to see their schools moving in the right direction,” Plank said in a statement released by USC News. “They still see a lot of room for improvement, but this is a very encouraging trend.”
Tax increases are not necessary to fund schools. Those that want tax increases are only voting for more poverty for themselves and their neighbors in one of the Highest Taxed States in the Union.
And the funds are always misappropriated and/or embezzled somehow. Irresponsible liberals.

School of Cinematic Arts 2012 alumnus and director A.J. Goodrich has finished editing his film, The Road Less Traveled By, a documentary following his 3,600-mile walk across the United States in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. The project took four years from inception to completion, and with the help of the current crowdfunding campaign, the documentary is ready to enter the post-production phase and hit the film festival circuit this year.
Goodrich is attempting to raise $35,000 by Sept. 17 through the crowdfunding campaign in order to pay for post-production sound editing, sound mixing, color correction, music rights, archival rights and festival fees.
“The biggest challenge was that I was doing the editing alone,” Goodrich said. “During the walk, even though it was really difficult at times, I had the crew with me, but keeping the focus to see it through over four years took a lot of perseverance. What always got me through was remembering that I walked across the whole country, and I felt like I owed it not only to myself but the people who walked with me and the people we met along the way to see the project through to the end.”
After editing and condensing more than 400 hours of footage and 31,000 photos over the course of four years, Goodrich is submitting the film to Sundance and other major film festivals around the world in addition to festivals with an emphasis in documentary film and LGBT specific festivals, such as Outfest in Los Angeles. The ultimate goal is to obtain distribution for the film on HBO documentaries, Netflix, PBS or the Travel Channel.
“I would like to see it go global,” said producer Mark Metivier. “I would like people in England or Australia or China to watch it because people who have never experienced America and don’t know what is going on here will learn so much. Also historically, 10 years from now, this film will be important.”
What began as a political grassroots campaign from Venice Beach to New York City quickly transformed into a journey about self-discovery, the idea of love and friendship and simple human connection. Goodrich and the group of friends who went on the trip with him met a wide variety of individuals with varying perspectives on their eight-month journey, from a queer commune in New Mexico to an Islamic gravedigger in the Mojave Desert. This unique human interaction made the trip much more insightful than Goodrich initially anticipated and proved that individuals across the country are bonded through universal issues and ideas.
“As long as the editing process was, it actually ended up being perfect timing with the Supreme Court passing gay marriage in June,” Goodrich said. “I think the movie provides a unique window into one of the most important human rights issues of our time and a snapshot of a point when public opinion was rapidly shifting.”
Goodrich hopes that the film’s final message to viewers is of hope and faith in humanity that will inspire young LGBT people to have more confidence in themselves and for heterosexual individuals to have a better understanding of what it means to be a part of the LGBT community.
“I am really looking forward to seeing The Road Less Traveled By,” said Audrey Emerson, a documentary film producer and junior majoring in critical studies. “It’s not just a story about an incredible personal journey, but about the larger things that bring us together and reaffirm our humanity. Traveling opens up worlds between people who appear to have nothing in common, and I think documentary film is a really amazing way to make us feel connected to one another.”

Phi Beta Kappa, the nation’s oldest academic honors society, has honored Durga Ghosh, a senior majoring in political economy, with a writing internship for the society’s online publication The Key Reporter. Ghosh is the first ever USC student to be accepted into the internship program.
When Ghosh was inducted into the USC chapter of Phi Beta Kappa last spring, she became interested  in involvement opportunities with programs the society has to offer.  After speaking with Dr. Robins Romans, associate provost and president of USC’s Epsilon Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, Ghosh was inspired to apply for the society’s prestigious writing internship.
The internship is offered to university students who are recommend by their institution’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter and also possess talent and demonstrate interest in research and writing.
Ghosh, a frequent contributor for Neon Tommy and previously the Daily Trojan, has had a background in journalistic writing—specifically sports—as well as travel writing. Ghosh became interested in travel writing while backpacking through Europe over the summer and began to compile a list of helpful tips while abroad.
“I would take notes on things I did to save money, and when I came back I explained it to my friends. ” Ghosh explains on where her interest on the topic first began. Telling her friends about the feasibility of traveling through Europe on a limited budget got them excited to do trips of their own.  The positive responses Ghosh received inspired her to write more on the topic for both The Key Reporter as well as for “The Traveling Stilettos”—an online travel and fashion blog.
In addition to being involved with USC’s chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa society, Ghosh volunteers for Troy Camp which serves youth who live around the USC campus year round, interns for the PAC-12 and works as a Spanish tutor, as well as a student advisor in the theater department.
“Durga is an exceptional student who has a strong commitment to interdisciplinary approaches to liberal arts studies,” Romans said. “This is evidenced by her major, which combines the study of politics and economics and her interest in theater.”
For the rest of the articles Ghosh intends to submit to The Key Reporter, she plans to focus on topics regarding health economics. As an political economy major ,Ghosh has spent a great deal of time researching the economics of the American healthcare system for her honors thesis, specifically analyzing the Affordable Care Act. However, she also plans to widen her lens to health economics in other parts of the world.
“I’ve taken a lot of global classes, so it branches out to not just what’s centric in the United States, but what’s relevant around the world,” she said.
Ghosh’s first article, which will be published on The Key Reporter’s website on Sept. 1st, will discuss the possible downsides of studying abroad.

I’m sorry: a phrase that has become too common in sports.  Over the years, we’ve heard it come out of the mouths of some of the world’s most accomplished athletes and sports figures — adulterer Tiger Woods and doper Alex Rodriguez are a couple of good examples among many more.
USC football coach Steve Sarkisian echoed this very same apologetic phrase not once, but twice in a press conference before the team’s practice on Tuesday. Sarkisian appeared somewhat defeated and dispirited while he opened up and apologized about his misconduct in front of hundreds of alumni and donors at last weekend’s Salute to Troy event.
It was as down as I’ve seen Sarkisian, or any college football coach for that matter, during his tenure at USC — even worse than the team’s last-second loss last year to Arizona State.
Sarkisian said the moral of the story is that when you mix medicine with alcohol, you sometimes say or do things that you regret, and he’s absolutely correct — his judgment at the time obviously wasn’t right, he acted inappropriately in a situation where he was supposed to properly represent the program and the university, and he said some things that he shouldn’t have said.
Now that this fiasco is almost last week’s news, though, I think that it’s time for everyone to put Sarkisian’s actions on the back burner.
Sometimes, saying you’re sorry and taking responsibility for your wrongdoing simply isn’t enough, like in the cases of Woods and Rodriguez, who forever tarnished their reputations for what they did.  Sarkisian’s actions, though, don’t even go near that.
In Sarkisian’s case, the time certainly did fit the crime. His apology, which came off as very genuine and sincere, was just enough. Not to forget the up-downs that his players punished him with on Monday.
Some people don’t think that should be the case, though.
Earlier this week, there were reports that angry alumni were contacting athletic department officials to say they wanted Sarkisian fired.
He surely doesn’t need to be stripped of his coaching duties, nor does he need to be reprimanded by being suspended for a game or two.
What good would that do?
The only benefit I can see in further punishment would be Athletic Director Pat Haden getting the chance to show that he holds his coaches accountable — like when he suspended former men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill for the 2011 Pac-10 Tournament after he engaged in an alcohol-related confrontation with an Arizona booster in a Los Angeles hotel lobby.
From an actual football standpoint, though, there is no incentive whatsoever to terminate or suspend Sarkisian.
This program has been through enough drama in what seems to be a never-ending soap opera with constant twists and turns and the occasional curve ball out of left field with Josh Shaw’s PR nightmare last fall.
The best remedy at this point for all parties involved is to simply try and move on from this unfortunate occurrence.
It’s in the best interest of fans, best interest of the team, and most importantly, the best interest of coach Sarkisian.
While it still remains unclear what exact problems Sarkisian is dealing with — whether it has to do with alcohol, family matters or other personal issues — he made it clear that he is, indeed, going through a hard time.
Last April, it was announced that the 41-year-old coach was in the process of getting a divorce from his wife of more than 17 years. The couple also has three children.
Earlier this month, Sarkisian  sold his Rolling Hills home for a mere $8.55 million, according to the Los Angeles Times. The 8,250-square-foot home reportedly had 18 TVs as well — that sure is a lot of TVs for watching college football.
Nonetheless, it seems like Sarkisian’s been going through quite a lot off the field, and I don’t think he’s gotten enough credit for manning up and opening up about his issues in front of reporters — not an easy thing to do.
Hopefully, Sarkisian is able to undergo whatever type of treatment he has arranged for himself so that he’s able to get through these tough times.
People can continue to make all of the jokes they want about Sarkisian not being able to hold his liquor or about him being an alcoholic, but at the end of the day, his team believes in him, his team leaders believe in him and, most importantly, he believes in himself to move on and coach a very talented football team.
And if this year’s team wants any chance at playing in the   Pac-12 championship game or even the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship Game, they’re going to need Sarkisian — not in rehab, not at home, but on the sidelines with his headset on and ready to go.
Darian Nourian is a senior majoring in print and digital journalism. He is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Persian Persuasion,” runs Fridays.
Sark needs more time. It’s difficult to explain just how much sanctions hurt the program, not to mention lane kiffin. 
Why would anyone at a university give a f*ck about football? Shouldn’t university students be interested in things that are actually important?
You’re in college now, Mr. Nourian. Time to grow up.
“From an actual football standpoint, though, there is no incentive whatsoever to terminate or suspend Sarkisian.”
“And if this year’s team wants any chance at playing in the   Pac-12 championship game or even the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship Game, they’re going to need Sarkisian — not in rehab, not at home, but on the sidelines with his headset on and ready to go”
someone needs to look closely in the mirror.

The USC women’s soccer team started their 2015 season with a bang; despite walking away from the past weekend with both a win and a loss, they effectively made a bold statement.
By defeating preseason-ranked No. 15 Texas Tech on Friday and keeping a close match against defending national champions and top-ranked Florida State on Sunday, the Women of Troy set a precedent for the rest of the season.
This Friday, USC will venture off Trojan grounds to take on the UC Riverside Highlanders (1-1) for their third game and second win of the Fall 2015 season.
The team hopes to continue its momentum and lead into this game with the buoyancy that rightfully defines it.
Senior forward Jamie Fink, a strong voice both on and off the field for USC, agrees that success through such a competitively demanding weekend sparked both confidence and drive that will keep the team on their toes and ready for anything that may come their way this season.
“It showed that we’re not going to give up, and we’re going to fight,” Fink said. “All it’s going to take is that extra ‘umph’ and that desire and heart. That is going to help us throughout                             the upcoming season.”
A tough battle not only requires a firm punch, but a sense of protection as well. The Women of Troy exemplified that having a strong defensive unit is crucial when going head-to-head with challenging teams.
“We’ve been focusing on our defensive tactics; they are setting the tone right now for our offensive,” Fink said.
Going off of Fink’s notion of interdependence, head coach Keidane McAlpine agreed that USC’s success stems from the combined camaraderie of every individual representing the Cardinal and Gold.
“It begins with our forwards, it begins with the total team defending,” McAlpine said. “It’s just the unity throughout the lines, and in that back line — in the mission, the cause, the detail work — that has paid off so far.”
After having to sit out last season due to her in-conference transfer from Oregon State, goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme is now in charge of covering the last line of defense for the Trojans.
After a shutout this past weekend against Texas Tech, spectators eagerly look forward to seeing more of her guiding performances throughout both the duration of the season and in-game versus the Highlanders this weekend.
“I know they are a tough team and have a high-pressure style of play,” Prudhomme said. “It will be a lot on our defense to make sure we are constantly focused and on our game.”
McAlpine shows the utmost certainty that Prudhomme and her backline, as well as Fink and her attacking end, are both ready to march into Highlander territory with a sense of harmony and togetherness to secure a successful performance.
”Some of the confidence and correcting some of the mistakes are some of the issues, but also trying to deepen the bench a little bit and add a few more players to the rotation,” McAlpine said. “I think that’s going to be important for our longevity.”
Over the weekend, USC defense pulled through with 173 scoreless minutes. As difficult as it may seem to mirror such a noteworthy statistic, the Women of Troy do not by any means consider the task out of reach.
“I think the best way to keep that up is to continue to play together,” Prudhomme said.
With their trip to Albuquerque behind them, USC will travel to Riverside to continue their evolution as a solitary unit. While there, the Women of Troy, led by McAlpine, hope to progress and keep pushing forward.
“My biggest hopes for the weekend are to continue to build on the momentum that we’ve gained playing two great opponents this past weekend,” McAlpine said. “Really just try to continue to grow, that’s the biggest goal out of the weekend.”
A team bound by its season motto and comprised of resilient players, USC soccer advances on its journey.
“I just want this team to have the utmost success and to conquer our goals, which are ‘one moment, one now,’ and to take it one game at a time,” Fink said.

The USC women’s volleyball team will be put to the test early as they host two of the nation’s finest teams at the Women of Troy Baden Invitational this Friday and Saturday.
The No. 22-ranked Women of Troy will open the 2015 regular season with matches against No. 7-ranked North Carolina and No. 11-ranked BYU at the Galen Center.
In addition, USC will be meeting Chicago State for the first time in the program’s history.
With two national powerhouses coming to Troy, head coach Mick Haley knows that his team has their work cut out for them.
“We’ve got two great tests ahead of us so it’s a heck of a weekend for us to start out this way but everybody’s really excited for the season to start,” Haley said. “There’s some apprehension in that this is a completely different team from last year, and we really haven’t played anybody yet so we’re in some uncharted waters right now, but I really like our players.”
As always, USC will be led by senior captain and two-time AVCA All-American outside hitter Samantha Bricio.
Bricio has been a mainstay in the USC lineup since she first came to Los Angeles as a freshman in 2012, and she hopes to leave her mark in her final season donning the cardinal and gold.
There’s a number of other returning players who will need to step up this year as well, according to Haley.
“Our sophomore Brittany Abercrombie on the right side is really ready to come into her own and we need Alicia Ogoms to be a shutdown middle blocker,” Haley said. “Junior setter Alice Pizzasegola needs to come into her own too this year, and Taylor Whittingham has demonstrated that she can be one of the better liberos, so we have the pieces, we just need to put them together.”
One of those pieces mentioned is junior libero Taylor Whittingham, who earned AVCA All-America Honorable Mention last season in her first year as a starter.
Like Haley, Whittingham is anxious for the season to start, noting that the culture in the gym is much different compared to last year.
“We’re really excited to get started, it’s a new season, a new team, a new system,” Whittingham said. “We have some fresh faces coming in, we’re really physical, we’re tall and our athleticism is really helping us in this new system, so we want to go out there and do our best to win every single game.”
Haley will also be showcasing a revamped lineup with a number of different players inserted into starting roles. Two of the newcomers making their Trojan debuts are freshmen Alyse Ford and Baylee Johnson.
Ford, an athletic 5’10” outside hitter with a big vertical leap, and Johnson, a physical 6’0” setter and hitter combo at the net, will both see significant playing time to start their USC careers.
USC will open up its season by taking on ACC powerhouse North Carolina on Friday at           8 p.m.
The Tarheels eliminated the Women of Troy in the second round of last year’s NCAA tournament with a 3-1 win in Chapel Hill, but now that USC will be at home in the friendly confines of the Galen Center, the Women of Troy are looking to avenge that season-ending loss.
On Saturday, USC will face off against two Cougar teams. The first match of the day will be against Chicago State at 10 a.m.
The  Cougars are coming off a 2014 season in which they finished with a 6-24 overall record, and it will be the first ever meeting between the two teams.
Later that night, USC will wrap up the Baden Invitational with a match against 2014 NCAA runner-up and current No. 11-ranked BYU.
The last time these two teams met, USC eliminated the Cougars in the 2013 NCAA regional semifinal held at the Galen Center.
Bricio had a season high of 30.0 points in the 3-1 win as USC improved to 11-5 all-time against BYU and 6-1 in postseason matches against the Cougars.
BYU , however, is coming off a 2014 season in which they pulled off an improbable run, being the first unseeded team to make it all the way to the national championship game before they fell to Penn State.
The BYU Cougars and Women of Troy face off at 8 p.m. and the match will broadcast on the  Pac-12 Networks.
It will be a challenging weekend for the Women of Troy with a tough slate of competitors ahead, but a good showing against two of the nation’s most accomplished programs could provide some early season confidence for Mick Haley and his new squad.
“This type of competition we have is competition that we expect to beat if we want to do anything in the NCAA tournament come December, so this is a true test,” Haley said. “We have good players, and if we can get them to play together and trust each other, they’re good enough to beat anyone in the country on any given night.”
This is it for Coach Haley, produce or be gone. Too many good recruits /players have left the program after one year or two.
Team missing a good second middle blocker. Noticed no mention of Elise Ruddins who in her third year should be at the top of her game which is not the case. Men volleyball coach Ferguson was let go after a better season than Haley so who knows
with Haden as A.D. what is in his mind.

There’s a time and place to sit down and read a thousand-page novel, and that’s preferably during a long flight or a relaxing summer. On the contrary, there are also many times when the thought of reading a book that weighs more than a brick is simply intolerable. With the beginning of a new school year, the free time and headspace to read can be greatly reduced, and a little book that can be polished off between classes or picked up for 10 minutes here and there is definitely a more attractive option than embarking on an epic novel. Well, not to worry. These six exquisite books, all under 150 pages, do not take weeks to read and will fit nicely into an overflowing handbag or backpack. They have captured my imagination and stayed with me just as much as books 10 times their size.
1. The Last Day of a Condemned Man by Victor Hugo
At 130 pages, this book is the longest on the list. It is still included simply because of how undervalued and absolutely haunting it is. From the author of Les Misérables comes the tale of a man who has been condemned to die by guillotine in 19th-century France. The book is in the form of a diary, in which the protagonist recounts the psychological effects of knowing he has mere hours left to live. Deeply moving and terrifyingly vivid, The Last Day of a Condemned Man does not fall short of Les Misérables.
2. Bluebeard by Angela Carter
This is an ideal book for anyone who is pressed for time and just doesn’t have the energy for anything too heavy. The book itself is composed of a series of classic fairy tales (think Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood and more), all told with a slight twist. What is so charming and special about Carter’s retelling of these deeply loved stories is her adherence to the quaint, old-fashioned language that most people associate with fairy tales. Each one is so fresh and magical, making this book perfect to pick up at the end of a long day.
3. The Diamond as Big as the Ritz by F. Scott Fitzgerald
This is one of Fitzgerald’s lesser-known novels and also possibly the most unique of his writings. It still bears his signature descriptions of opulence and old-money glamor, but this time in a much more sinister fashion. A mixture between a thriller and a fairytale, this novella is definitely worth a read. Fitzgerald has truly let his imagination run wild with a semi-magical mansion set atop a mountain made of solid diamond, where the inhabitants murder their guests to ensure their secret is never revealed.
4. The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway
This book not only won a Pulitzer, but also was cited as one of the key works that led to Hemingway’s Nobel Prize in 1954. Within the pages of this incredibly short novel is an epic story of a fisherman and his battle with a fish of gargantuan proportions. Hemingway is often praised for his minimalist style, and this novel is an excellent example of it. Every word is absolutely essential to the story, and yet Hemingway manages to say so much in such a beautiful way with absolute simplicity. This is an absolute classic that proves the timelessness of literature.
5. The Stranger by Albert Camus
The Stranger, adopted from the French title L’Etranger, is another classic novel. Camus masterfully tells the story of a French-Algerian man who, following his mother’s death, emotionlessly murders another man. During his trial, it becomes clear that the protagonist is not being judged based on his guilt or innocence, but rather for his apathetic feelings toward the crime. The book raises very interesting questions about the criminal justice system, race and segregation in French-dominated Algeria as well as how a society’s expectation of how an individual should react to a situation can be more important than the truth. Camus is one of the most brilliant and celebrated authors of the 20th century, but his existentialist prose can be a little difficult at times. This is why The Stranger is a perfect read; it is short and can be read in one sitting but will provide the reader with the questions and attitudes that shaped not only literature, but also popular culture and European thought in the years following its publication.
6. Heartburn by Nora Ephron
What makes this book so ideal for reading during a busy day is not just its length, but also its light tone. Though the plot follows the breakdown of a woman’s marriage, Ephron brings such humor to her prose that tears from laughter are guaranteed. It’s easy to see that the author of this book is the same woman who wrote the screenplays for When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle, and crafted such hilarious one-liners and touching moments throughout the films. If that wasn’t enough, Ephron throws some delicious food into the mix with a protagonist who happens to be a cookbook author who blends recipes in seamlessly with the plot.

BierBeisl Imbiss, the brainchild of Chef Bernhard Mairinger, is one of the newest eateries to open up in downtown Los Angeles. With its cool warehouse-chic vibe that pairs perfectly with the somewhat dated decorations of the Spring Arcade Building where it is nestled, BBI offers hungry crowds a relaxed environment that (almost) always has its front door invitingly swung open.
Swashes of white paint on the gray flooring, juxtaposed with rough, unfinished granite pillars combined with cool lighting make for an interesting yet inviting ambience. The artwork that adorns the whitewashed walls and the murals outside the restaurant are the work of one of BBI’s investors. These architectural photographs showcase the rich history of downtown Los Angeles in black and white, giving BBI a touch of nostalgia in the midst of modern downtown L.A. that captures the spirit of the eatery’s concept: rustic Austrian street food reinvented with contemporary twists.
Greeted with a smile by the waiter, he proceeded to give detailed descriptions of menu selections, making the already difficult decision-making process even more so. In the end, the list consisted of a sampler of three types of sausages for $15 — the Käsekrainer, a swiss cheese infused Polish link made of pork and beef; the Weisswurst, which consists of all veal with a pork casing poached in milk; and the Grillwurst, a peppery, coarse and crispy seared sausage made of pork and veal. It was served with three types of bread — Bierbeisl, pretzel and whole grain. They offer the “Bratl” sandwich, a crispy pork belly served on a pretzel roll in a bed of horseradish-cabbage slaw and mustard-pickled cucumbers, for $12. What’s more, an organic fried egg can be added to the order of “Bratl,” per the waiter’s recommendation, for $2. For sides, the curry fries and sauerkraut made for worthy companions of the main dishes. Each side costs $5, and there is a total selection of six different dishes, namely shoestring fries, curry fries, sauerkraut, potato salad, speck-cabbage salad and organic mixed greens.
The food was served in a paper platter on a specially made wooden board with indentations designed to hold various elements of a meal: a space for a cup of fries, a rectangle for the main dish and another made to hold a flagon of beer or to slot in a glass of wine. The sausage sampler came with five different types of condiments: a tomato confit chutney, spicy mustard, brown mustard, sweet mustard and freshly-ground horseradish. The chutney was pleasantly sweet, with juicy tomato chunks that went well with the rich saltiness of the Käsekrainer. The three mustards all lacked the sharp tang that was expected of them, and the sweet mustard was unexpectedly sugary. The ground horseradish remained untouched after being mistaken for Parmesan cheese. The Weisswurst made for a smooth medley, with an almost milky texture that was surprisingly enjoyable. The crispy skin of the Grillwurst offered an exciting contrast. All the sausages were made using the chef’s secret recipe, making it all the more special.
Be prepared to get your hands dirty when digging into the “Bratl,” without which one would not be able to fully immerse in the symphony of ingredients. The pieces of pork belly were a little on the dry side, but made up for it in flavor. The slaw offset the denseness of the pretzel roll as the hard bread soaked up the juices, and one will have a hard time trying to keep everything together in a neat pile. The homemade pickles were the highlight, with a perfect balance of tanginess and freshness that tied everything together nicely. It did not leave the strange aftertaste that is characteristic of most pickles. Rather, it served as a palate cleanser incorporated into the dish itself that allowed patrons to better taste and distinguish other flavors.
Make no mistake — the side dishes were anything but foils. One might even dare to venture that the curry fries were the star of the show. The golden fritters were coated generously with seasoning, giving off a delicious smell that curry spices can emit. A perfectly cooked, crispy outside combined nicely with a fluffy inside made each piping hot fry a joy to devour. The only chink in the armor is that BBI could better the fries with an even stronger curry flavor. The sauerkraut, which according to the waiter, had been “simmering all day,” was tender and well-balanced flavor-wise. It complements without overpowering the “Bratl” with much finesse.
BBI featured a thoroughly enjoyable meal in a lovely setting that puts people immediately at ease, along with a promise to return not long after.

In an era of divided politics, so-called millennial disenchantment and historically low voter turnout in local and state races, especially within Los Angeles, I feel compelled to contribute to some sort of positive change. But it’s easy for millennials to feel lost and outnumbered by the growing crowd of lackluster politicians who offer hollow promises — many of whom are disengaged because we feel that the officials who enact laws do not weigh our beliefs as heavily as they do for those who are a part of their generation. As a result, political participation in Los Angeles has remained bleak and disappointing for officials, politically minded fellows and those who understand the ramifications of failing to take the political process seriously.
Considering that 35 percent of people in Los Angeles are under 25, millennials have a unique stake in the political process. But the question is whether or not these young voters are using their capacity to influence change by taking action. That’s where this column comes in. With the many — sometimes even daily — changes to policy in the city, it’s difficult to keep up. Each week, I promise to select a political issue in the city of Los Angeles that requires your attention and will allow you to actively contribute to the political process. This week’s issue is not only one which will grab your interest as a politically active citizen, meaning one who cares about the policies implemented, but one which ties into your interests as a student. I intend to display how the interplay of mandated law and change in USC’s surrounding community can positively and negatively impact your time here — whether or not you are a native Angeleno.
USC students are all too familiar with Uber. It’s not just convenience that the ridesharing company, marketed so well — it’s also safety, cost efficiency, environmental friendliness and simplicity. With a touch of a few buttons, a fully coherent or even an inebriated individual can request a ride from whichever destination they require. On campus, the University’s partnership with Uber to create free rides has made its students safer and alleviated some of the burden on its Campus Cruiser service.
But the legality of Uber’s simple ridesharing program has created significant buzz among constituents and Los Angeles City officials in the past few months. On Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council lifted their sanction banning ridesharing companies such as Uber and Lyft from picking up passengers at arrival terminals from Los Angeles International Airport with a 9-6 vote. In the past, ridesharing companies were allowed to drop passengers off at departure but were legally barred from waiting to pick up customers. This, in turn, allowed the taxi company business to remain lucrative without fear of competing for cheaper ride fares from other sources.
The council’s vote, allowing passengers to be picked up by rideshare companies, suggests that traditional government protocol must follow adaptations to modernizations in new innovation. And governmental policy should be ready to adapt because great changes are coming, industry by industry. Whether it be in the hotel or taxi industry, you’ve already witnessed firsthand the power of new innovation. Yet it seems that many are failing to take these new businesses as seriously as they should.
Though the city council’s decision is a big feat for students who cannot afford the fare from taxi companies, opposition from proponents of exclusivity rights among taxi companies has not been unwarranted. Just last week, prosecutors from San Francisco and Los Angeles made their case against the legitimacy of Uber’s safety protocols during the company’s process of hiring new drivers. Claims against the company state that felons and criminals with misdemeanors have been overlooked and that Uber must revamp and include additional safety measures when hiring drivers.
But this calls into question the legitimacy of perceiving one company’s “safety measures” as more superior than the other when both companies run state and local government-mandated safety checks. And when you analyze both sides, you realize that the prosecutors’ claims against Uber and Lyft seem less legitimate and more politically motivated. According to the Los Angeles Times, while taxis are regulated by the city and require fingerprinting, app-based companies are mandated to use social security numbers to collect data on criminal records.
Government-mandated safety measures need to be more equal — especially in the eyes of the consumer, City officials should do their best to ensure an equal playing ground for mandated safety protocol. While the playing field cannot always be equal among competing ridesharing and taxi companies, it is imperative that elected officials at least address an important concern on constituents’ minds: safety.

In the past few weeks, Democratic leaders have been scrambling to garner support — largely from their own party — for the Iran deal. There has been bipartisan opposition in both Congress and in the general public. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, who many believe will take over Harry Reid’s position as Senate Democratic leader, has publicly opposed the deal, and 56 percent of Americans think Congress should reject the deal, according to a new CNN-ORC poll. Those in favor of it claim that the alternative is war.
This rhetoric worries hundreds of thousands of Iranian-Americans in this country, many of whom live in Los Angeles. Here at USC, many Iranian-American students worry for their families and the Iranian people as a whole, and this deal gives them hope. Supporters of the deal have perpetuated a false dilemma — they assert that our only two options are approving this deal or going to war with Iran. As a result, many of those USC students and other Iranian-Americans might believe that the deal allows the U.S. to avoid conflict with Iran. They don’t want their family members to have to suffer the inevitable destruction a war would bring to Iran. They also recognize the negative domestic implications war with Iran carries for Iranian-Americans — misguided leadership and fervent public emotion could lead to persecution of Iranian-American citizens should war break out. These concerns are well-founded and earnest, but the Iran deal is not the solution.
Those in favor of the deal assume that when sanctions are lifted, Iran will experience economic relief, which translates into financial relief for the average Iranian citizen. This assumption fails to recognize that the Iranian economy is not driven by market forces; the economic health of the country is at the mercy of the government. Almost all of the new income and wealth generated from the deal will fall into the hands of the ayatollahs and their cronies. The $150 billion worth of frozen assets that is inexplicably being returned to Iran will only further empower this group of enormously wealthy religious extremists. In effect, this deal enables the Iranian government, arguably the most egregious abuser of human rights in the world, to continue to line its own pockets while it kills Iranian citizens.
Not only does the deal threaten the Iranian people, but it also — contrary to the assertions of those in favor of the deal — endangers U.S. national security and increases the likelihood of eventual war. The deal allows Iran to maintain the infrastructure necessary to develop a nuclear bomb. It allows Iran to continue enriching a small amount of uranium every year, and to continue some levels of nuclear research. To give these concessions to a country that has violated agreements regarding its nuclear program a countless number of times is foolish.
Iran cannot be trusted, and this is a deal based on trust. In 15 years, the restrictions on enrichment will expire. By this time, Iran will have the resources to expedite development of nuclear warheads. When that happens, the U.S. will not have the options it has now — it will almost certainly be forced to go to war.
To believe Iran will not do everything it can to build a weapons program is to forget that the Iranian government is the world’s largest sponsor of terrorism; it is to forget that the Iranian government organizes “Death to America” rallies while stifling popular protests for peace with violence. Tragically, a portion of the money that Iran receives as a result of this deal will likely go to groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas that use a perverted view of Islam to justify horrific acts of violence and war. These groups have specifically targeted America as the ultimate enemy.
All of this is not to say that Secretary of State John Kerry did not have good intentions negotiating this deal. The intentions of those who favor the deal are also undoubtedly good. But the U.S cannot afford to lose leverage. The concessions Iran made seem unsubstantial compared to the ones the U.S. made.  U.S. leaders did not even make an earnest effort to bring home the American hostages Iran is holding.
The alternative to this deal is not war — it’s a better deal. Iranian-Americans need to recognize that anything that empowers the Iranian government endangers the Iranian people, and all American citizens need to recognize that the Iranian government and the Iranian people are two different entities. Any Iranian-American who has visited the country will tell you that most people living there hold America in high regard. Iranian people want peace, and this deal brings nothing but uncertainty.
Too late, Nima. Iran has outsmarted Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry and has achieved what it wanted: The end of sanctions and freedom to proceed without effective inspections of its nuclear weapons production. Further, the Dem leadership has lined up enough votes to assure that Congress will not be able to nix the deal. And our allies, desperate for trade with Iran, especially for oil, are rushing to sign huge new contracts with the mighty Ayatollahs. How about this? Did you notice that the UK has now re-opened its embassy in Iran? 
Was the deal good for the US? Bad? Not particularly. Iran will begin violating it immediately, and there is nothing we can do to reinstate the sanctions. If nothing else, this deal was simply a silly, empty exercise to show that Mr. Obama is a great statesman, able to negotiate “deals” with a virulent enemy. But this is not new. UK PM Neville Chamberlain thought that he had achieved a similar brilliant diplomatic triumph at the Munich Conference back in 1938. In fact, he announced that he was positive that Adolf Hitler was honest, sincere, and could be trusted. Right. Just like the Iranian ayatollahs of today.
Why does there need to be a “deal” with Iran? Why cannot they choose their own destiny like every other nation? There is no single atomic bomb or score of bombs that threaten the very existence of these united states. Why do the leaders of the USA seek to guide the destiny of ANY other nation?

Marshall School of Business senior Josh Gorokhovsky and his cousin Jeffrey Morgenstein launched their app Oust in the Apple App store this summer, creating a real-time market platform of activities to do and places to go for Angelenos.
The process to create Oust has been in the works since 2013. Morgenstein, a UCLA alumnus, taught himself how to code and created the program for Oust from scratch. Gorokhovsky has focused on the design of the app, from the initial sketches on paper to developing the app design for the iPhone screen.
“How Oust looked in sketches on paper to what it is now is day and night,” Gorokhovsky said. “This, the way Oust looks now, is probably the 80th design.”
The idea for Oust was created as a solution to the boredom Morgenstein and Gorokhovsky faced while trying to decide what to do in Los Angeles. There was no simple solution that recommended specially curated activities. Sites such as Yelp require users to know what to search for beforehand. Sites such as Groupon give ideas of different activities but can’t guarantee a good vendor or experience. Gorokhovsky and Morgenstein felt they needed to create Oust to fill that void.
“Oust is a one-stop shop to figure out what you want to do. The best part about it is that most people haven’t heard of these activities,” Morgenstein said.
Gorokhovsky manually created the special curation of activities and places. The duo hopes to create an electronic mechanism to implement crawlers in order to help Gorokhovsky with his curation process.
“I find the places through a curating process that I’ve developed,” Gorokhovsky said. “Right now, it is all manual, and I’ve put the leg work in to find all these vendors.”
The automatic system that Morgenstein plans to create will enable the crawlers to cross reference various activity based blogs to curate activities.
Morgenstein and Gorokhovsky prioritized making the activity feed for users personal through the curation process. Oust uses data from Facebook and tracks the user’s preferences made within the app to create an experience tailored to each user.
“Ideally the app is like your best friend that knows what you like already,” Morgenstein said.
Gorokhovsky said he utilized the lessons he has learned and friends he has made at Marshall to create Oust.
“I took a lot of entrepreneurial classes that sort of gave me a leg up, especially with taking calculated steps and moving fast while I do it,” Gorokhovsky said. “Before I would see the problem and try to solve it on paper instead of just actually doing something about it.”
Gorokhovsky and Morgenstein have been working on the next steps for Oust. They plan to phase out vendors’ abilities to submit real time deals for customers on the same night on the app to drive business with potential customers. They also plan to partner with specific vendors to create the Oust Experience, which would be achieved through Oust forming partnerships with specific vendors and paying through the Oust app ahead of time.
The founders of Oust hope to have created an app that USC students will find useful and fun.
“We are working right now to secure more places around USC for students to go to, and we hope we can get some Trojan support,” Gorokhovsky said.
Alexis Hunter, a senior majoring in psychology, said she enjoys the app because of its efficiency.
“The interface is really great. It’s always good to have a pretty design and they do that well. I like the function too,” Hunter said. “If I can find something that is both cheap, and I could do it right now, I think that is the best selling point.”
Nicolette Canale, a senior majoring in biological sciences, said she appreciates the way Oust gives users a new way to make the best use of their time in Los Angeles.
“I think it’s really good that it’s real time,” Canale said. “When people are bored the first thing you do is scroll through your social media so if Oust taps into that boredom they could get a lot more people into the app.”

Though construction of The Village is well underway, it’s not the only project that will provide more housing to USC students. Thanks to a donation from trustee Malcolm Currie and his wife, Barbara, this month, the new residence hall at the Health Sciences Campus will be named after the family. The hall is set to open by August 2016.
Currie’s $10 million gift will support both on-campus student housing at the Health Science Campus and the Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience. The gift will be allocated such that $9 million will go toward housing construction at HSC and $1 million will go towards the Michelson Center.  In recognition of the gift, both the residence hall and the Michelson Center lobby will be named in honor of the Currie family.
Laurie Stone, associate senior vice president of Real Estate and Asset Management at USC, said there will be 167 apartment-style units with 450 bed spaces for students in the new housing building. Units will range from one bedroom to four bedrooms, and each bedroom will have its own bathroom. The residence building will be open to any student enrolled in a program at HSC. Amenities will also include a ground floor day care center for the campus.
The project is overseen by American Campus Communities, the owner and manager of the student housing component. Since the project is being built by American Campus Communities, its management will not be controlled or operated by USC Auxiliary services.
Stone said the origins of the project go back to 2010 when a master plan was created for the building.
“Student housing was identified by campus stakeholders as a need,” Stone said. “The medical students, pharmacy students — they work very long hours so this provides convenience and housing in a safe campus setting.”
The remaining $1 million will support construction of the Michelson Center. Scheduled for completion in 2017, the center will add 190,000 square feet of space to host new laboratories and offices for researchers in various engineering and science disciplines. When it’s finished, it will be the largest building on the University Park Campus.
Scott Fraser, provost professor of biological sciences and biomedical engineering, will be one of many professors moving his or her lab into the Michelson Center. His work includes microscopic imaging that is capable of visualizing the beating heart of an embryonic organism as it matures.
“[The Michelson Center will] create a nexus on campus for next-generation work that spans disciplines and scales,” Fraser said. “This generous gift will go toward shaping the building so that it serves the needs of it users.”
Bethany Jarvis, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, thinks the gift’s two beneficiaries — a new residence hall and the Michelson Center — will serve to complement each other.
“I think this is a great opportunity for the scientific community at USC,” Jarvis said. “A new residence hall at HSC will attract more students to USC while the Michelson Center will recruit renowned faculty members and researchers.”

Growing up in Southern California, Amy Ross was anything but typical. As a nine-year-old, she turned her playhouse into a laboratory where she worked on science experiments. She spent her days dissecting rattlesnakes and gophers and found herself somewhat of an outcast among the typical preteen crowd.
Thirty years later, Ross, a cancer researcher, co-founded the Lambda LGBT Alumni Association, served as president of the Alumni Association Board of Governors and, most recently, was named a trustee.
The La Crescenta, California, native grew up with her mother, father and two younger sisters.
“It was the ideal southern California suburban lifestyle,” Ross said.
Ross said her family was an athletic one.
“We rode horses and my dad was an avid golfer,” Ross said. “We were the only house with three girls living in it that had a basketball hoop over the garage.”
Ross graduated from Crescenta Valley High School in 1970 before heading to University of California, Irvine as the first college student in her family. As she started her collegiate career, budget cuts and slashes to school funding had spread across the country. Many professors chose not to show up to class at all.
“I was really disheartened,” Ross said. “You get into college and the professors are saying because of the budget cuts they can’t teach their class.”
She worked at a laundromat for a few years, but soon decided that she had a craving for learning and research. Ross said quitting school after her freshman year was one of the worst things she could have done. Ready to hit the books, Ross returned to school and attended California State University at Northridge, which she chose because of the heavily research-oriented labs. Ross said she was able to gain hands-on experience at Northridge — her first since her days as a little girl playing in her childhood lab.
“In those days, to do a lot of hands-on undergraduate research was not the norm,” Ross said.
After graduating from CSUN, Ross earned her Ph.D. from the Keck School of Medicine at USC in experimental pathology in 1986. Academic research brought Ross to USC just as it had led her to Cal State Northridge.
Shortly after graduating from Keck, Ross received postdoctoral training at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the cancer and blood institute. Afterward, she began a cancer diagnostics lab in conjunction with a transplant surgeon from Cedars. After years of working in the lab, she transitioned into retirement while serving as an associate biologist at the California Institute of Technology.
After years of dedicating herself to cancer research, Ross hung up her lab coat in 1992 and became one of the founders of USC’s first alumni group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Trojans. Showing her dedication toward the school, she helped set up the Lambda LGBT Alumni Association to help connect LGBT students and alumni. In 2000, Ross began funding a scholarship called the Amy Ross Scholarship in LGBT Health Studies.
After serving as president of the USCAA Board of Governors for years, Ross was elected to serve in an even larger role — USC trustee. She hopes to bring her broad experience in the community and with the school alumni association to her new position.
“I think I have a slightly different background in terms of some diversity issues,” Ross said. “It will be an honor to continue to serve USC.”
Because of her background, she hopes to advance the university’s excellence in terms of improving academics and research. She also brings wisdom from the things she herself has learned in life.
“Try. There is no shame in failure,” Ross said. “Explore your world. Expand your boundaries. It’s the best time of your life to explore. Take advantage of the university and all it has to offer.”
Ross said she can’t wait for the semester to start so she can begin improving the school’s academics and research labs.

As part of a three-day workshop on the past, present and future of the state of California, the Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study hosted Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles. Wednesday’s event, moderated by Professor Manuel Pastor, was integrated into the workshop’s programming on the theme, “California: Past Imagined, Present Innovation and Future Sustainability.”
The workshop’s opening night focused on the state’s past was hosted on the University Park Campus while Thursday’s events on California’s present will be based at Clockshop in Elysian Park. The event will conclude on Friday at the Huntington Library in San Marino, where participants will examine the state’s future and sustainability.
“The Polymathic Academy is dedicated to interdisciplinary thinking, trying to bring people from all different backgrounds to solve problems holistically, like we’re doing with California in this conference,” said Andrew Schmidt, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law.  Schmidt now serves as a program assistant for the Academy.
“Villaraigosa is an important figure in California’s recent past as the previous L.A. mayor, but also with the initiatives for California that he has continued with after he was mayor, he’s very forward-looking. He’s a nice bridge for those two facets of the conference,” said Maureen Lenker, a 2011 USC graduate and a member of the Harman Academy’s second graduating class.
In the discussion, Villaraigosa and Pastor explored a number of subjects related to the state, including the notion of the California dream, immigration, income inequality and transportation. Both men argued that in the future, policymakers and scholars would need to “reimagine” the California dream, rather than completely reinvent its identity.
“The dream isn’t as alive in the African American and Latino communities,” Villaraigosa said. “Disproportionately, we see not enough high school graduates … We see a prison pipeline that has disproportionate numbers of African American and Latino males. We see that health outcomes are very different in some groups. A lot of this is based on race and ethnicity, yet at the same time, we’re seeing more African Americans and Latinos going to college than ever before.”
Villaraigosa claimed that the recent decision to raise L.A.’s minimum wage to $15 an hour alone would not be enough to address disparities in opportunity. He also named greater investment in workforce development and strengthening the community college system as a necessary step to bridging the gap.
“Even though mayors don’t have responsibilities for schools, I said ‘forget that.’ If the anchor of a great neighborhood is a great public school, then the anchor of great cities, states and nations is a great public school system. In no small part because I benefited from [Los Angeles public schools],” Villaraigosa said.
The former mayor identified low voter turnout as the state’s largest obstacle for restoring economic prosperity and reimagining the California dream.
The idea for the three-day conference was pitched by Professor Geoffrey Cowan, who serves on the Polymathic Academy’s advisory board. After several months of planning, the workshop was brought to fruition by Tara McPherson, director of the Polymathic Academy, Karin Huebner, academic director of programs,  Cowan, Lenker and Schmidt.
Huebner described the planning process behind the workshop and the academy’s effort to remain true to its multidisciplinary roots.
“Being a part of the Polymathic Academy, I wanted to make sure that we approached the topic from multiple registers — art, industry demographics, politics, diversity, infrastructure — so if you look at all the speaker panels, you’ll see how that is reflected in this workshop,” Huebner said. “There’s no way to get a comprehensive look at California in three days, but you can start to tap into it and see that there’s more to explore.”
To apply for participation in the conference, students were asked to pitch a proposal to the next Governor of California, the Los Angeles Times or the New York Times on how the state of California could be a positive force domestically and globally in the future. Huebner named the diversity of the students participating, in terms of area of study and background, as an integral factor for the workshop’s success.
For the fall semester, the Polymathic Academy has six signature “Polymathic Pizza” events based in USC Libraries,  which engage students through critical and integrative thinking and communication.
“The library is such an important  part of the university because it is the center. Everyone comes to the library to research or to study or to center their academic life. That’s the reason the Polymathic Academy is based here,” Schmidt said.
In November, the Polymathic Academy will host a one-day conference celebrating the centennial of Einstein’s general theory of relativity, an event pitched by Clifford Johnson, a professor in the physics department.
