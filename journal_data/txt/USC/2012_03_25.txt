The Graduate Student Government will elect its executive board members this week after electing Yael Adef, a first year student in the Masters of Social Work program, as GSG president.
Adef said as president she will advocate on behalf of students before the administration and will work toward helping graduate students from all schools feel part of the larger USC community.
“The graduate student experience is definitely different,” Adef said. “Many graduate and professional students commute and have other things in their lives, but we are all still part of one Trojan Family.”

As president, Adef said she hopes to facilitate more interaction between the various graduate and professional schools.
“So often graduate students are so passionate about what they’re doing, they spend all their time investing in only their one program,” Adef said. “I want to help students feel like they are part of something bigger, part of the larger USC community.”
Adef currently serves as the social chair on the GSG executive board. Adef said she will work specifically on linking the University Park Campus and the Health Sciences Campus by increasing the frequency and efficiency of shuttle services.
Adef is also a residential coordinator in the Birnkrant Residential College and earned a bachelor’s degree in political science and psychology from USC. Adef said she wants to increase programming between GSG and USG.
Adef said she will use her experiences in the social work program and GSG to help her interact with graduate students and achieve her goals as president.
“I went to law school after my undergrad at USC and ended up working as a litigator at an extremely large firm,” Adef said. “I found myself unhappy with the adversarial nature of the work I was doing, however, and wanted to really refocus on helping people.”
Though Adef has many new ideas and plans for her administration, she said she also hopes to continue the work initiated by current GSG President Ryan Estes.
“I was able to accomplish four main things,” Estes said. “Changing the name from [Graduate and Professional Student Senate] to [Graduate Student Government], starting the Metro TAP program, which allows graduate students to use public transportation at an extremely discounted rate, revamping the conference travel grant website and revising election procedures.”
Before this year, every executive board member was chosen by a Senate vote, but now only the President, vice president and Health Sciences Campus director are chosen by direct vote, Estes said.
“All other directors and executive board members will be chosen by a committee consisting of the incoming and outgoing presidents, the person who formerly held the position and two senators,” Estes said. “This ensures that all GSG officers are qualified and have the credentials necessary to lead.”
Though Adef was elected by a direct vote of the Senate, she will participate in the new election procedures this week as executive board members are chosen by a committee.

Crimes against a person
At 4:04 p.m. on March 22, a staff member at the Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Research Institute reported that during the past two weeks she has been the target of harassment by another staff member while driving a university tram.
Crimes against property
at 1:48 p.m. on March 23, a student reported that an unknown subject smashed a beer bottle against a wall of Delta Chi fraternity and it damaged the driver’s side taillight on his vehicle. The student subsequently learned that the bottle was thrown from a neighboring fraternity house and the vice president of that fraternity agreed to pay for the damage when contacted by DPS officers.
At 4:09 P.m. on March 22, a suspect entered a classroom while a class was in session and removed wallets from two students’ purses.  The students followed the suspect, who dropped the wallets as she left the classroom. The suspect fled into another building and was detained by DPS officers who responded to the scene.  The students positively identified the suspect, who was arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 1:43 a.m. on March 23, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect attempting to detach the front wheel from a bicycle secured to a rack outside Fluor Tower and detained him for investigation. The bike was registered to a student and, when the officers contacted her, she said no one had permission to remove it. The suspect was arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
at 12:24 A.m. on March 23, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated non-USC female who chipped two teeth and sustained a cut to her nose when she tripped and fell outside Sigma Chi fraternity. An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #10 responded.  The RA Unit examined the female and transported her to California Hospital for medical treatment.
At 6:43 p.m. on March 22, DPS officers responded to a report of a non-USC male yelling at passing vehicles while standing in the middle of the street near 30th Street and Vermont Avenue. The officers detained the subject and found him to be intoxicated and unable to care for himself.  The male was arrested and transported to S/W station for booking.
At 11:40 a.m. on March 22, a staff member in Parking Structure A reported that an emblem was missing from his department- issued hat.

Every time a group of young elementary school children stroll down Trousdale Parkway admiring what most Trojans take for granted, USC students are reminded of the university’s dedication to helping neighborhood children earn a college degree.
It was not until after the riots of 1992, however, that USC began to establish programs with local schools, said Tammara Anderson, executive director of the Joint Educational Project.
“[Former] President [Steven B.] Sample wanted to re-evaluate how USC works with the community and Sample believed we should connect with a few local schools,” Anderson said.
What began as a network of five local schools soon transformed into the USC Family of Schools that adopts thousands of neighborhood children from 15 schools around the University Park Campus and Health Sciences Campus into the Trojan Family. The goal of the program is to provide neighborhood students the resources they need to reach the college of their dreams, Anderson said.
“USC pushed me to explore and expand my academic boundaries,” said Jesus Moran, a graduate of Manuel Arts High School who will attend Harvard University next year to pursue a degree in political science. “USC students, JEP mentors and [Neighborhood Academic Initiative] alumni visited my school and pushed me to become a better student by showing me that going to a great college was possible.”
The Neighborhood Academic Initiative is a program within the USC Family of Schools that enrolls sixth-grade students into a six-year college preparation course that features daily morning classes at USC and Saturday schools.
Though Moran said the program is rigorous and many students drop, most students who stay on the NAI track get into a four-year college and receive a full-tuition scholarship.
“There are many requirements,” Moran said. “You have to maintain a 2.5 GPA, have a 92 percent attendance rate on Saturdays and your parents have to attend meetings too, but it is feasible and possible.”
Kim Barrios, executive director of NAI, said 100 percent of the students who currently complete the NAI program get into college, 35 percent earning acceptance to USC.
“It’s about changing the question from ‘Am I going to college?’ to ‘Where am I going to college?’” Barrios said. “Before this program, few students who went to high school near the USC neighborhood got accepted into college and fewer graduated.”
Barrios said all students attending a school in the USC Family of Schools are eligible to participate in the NAI program. Students who begin the NAI program but transfer out of a USC Family School lose their NAI eligibility.
Jasmine Torres, a sophomore majoring in sociology, lost her NAI eligibility when she moved schools but still found a way to USC.
“NAI is a terrific program but not everyone is able to participate,” Torres said. “There are so many kids that pass by USC or come to campus to play basketball or soccer but they don’t believe that they could ever be a student here.”
Barrios said the most important benefit students gain from the USC Family of Schools programs is the interaction with USC students.
“My son went to Foshay Learning Center and when he was in the second grade he was in the USC ReadersPlus program,” Barrios said. “I picked him up one day and he said ‘Mom! Mom! There’s my buddy.’ All I saw was a big giant kid that had to be a football player when my son said ‘Him! Him! He’s my reading buddy!’”
Barrios said a core mission of the USC Family of Schools is to get elementary, middle and high school students excited to work with USC students.
“It’s about having someone who cares for them, another adult who genuinely wants them to succeed,” Barrios said.

The Los Angeles Times and Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences released a poll Sunday about the support for Republican presidential candidates and how they would perform against President Barack Obama.
The poll shows that Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney carries the support of many of the Republican voters in California, with 42 percent of registered Republicans saying they would vote for Romney if the California primary were held today. Romney’s closest rival, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, captured about 23 percent of votes.
Source: Los Angeles Times Dornsife Poll, Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
If the November presidential election were held today between Obama and Romney, Obama would receive 57 percent of the vote in California and Romney would receive 36 percent, according to the poll.
The poll also showed discontent with the current options for presidential candidates. Approximately half of the Republican voters said they wished there were other candidates running for president.
In November 2011, the Los Angeles Times and Dornsife released a poll showing a remarkably different race, with Romney leading by only 27 percent of the vote among Republican presidential candidates and former business executive Herman Cain being Romney’s closest competitor.
Kevin Koeller, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the Republican Party has many strong candidates and the election process, which some people have considered detrimental, could actually help Republicans influence more voters.
“Any of the [Republican] candidates have the capacity to be good leaders since they all are experienced and knowledgeable about the [United States],” Koeller said. “The election process is great for the party, because it gives more publicity to the candidates and better shows the public their values and beliefs.”
Kaya Masler, political director for USC College Democrats, said the Republican Party’s drawn-out election process will not be as important in the general election because most voters focus on the issues rather than the process.
“People assume that [the Republican primaries] will hurt them more than it will because the candidate will eventually be chosen and the rest of the party will consolidate their support,” Masler said. “What could hurt [the Republican Party] more is their focus on social issues right now, when they have a strong opportunity to talk about economics.”
The California Republican primary will be held June 5.

The average person’s life consists of a lot of shopping: roaming the aisles of stores for groceries, clothes, appliances and furniture, and repeatedly doling out money.
But the city would be too boring if all the stores in it were just for basic necessities. And if any one store could counteract the everyday shopping experience, it’s the Echo Park Time Travel Mart.
Among clustered city streets lies this quirky gem, which greets you with the phrase “Whenever you are, we’re already then” printed on its storefront; there’s also a giant robot interacting with a caveman on display behind the store’s giant windows.
There’s a deceiving air of familiarity when you enter the mart. You see the usual signs hanging overhead, describing each aisle’s contents. The prices are marked, the names clear to read.
But there’s something very different about the store — upon closer inspection, the shelves are filled with rare treasures.
Where could you possibly purchase a bottle of Professor Clutterbuck’s Elixir of Eternal Life? Or a legitimate piece of chainmail? Or pins with the faces of your favorite dead authors?
As if the kooky items weren’t enough, the store also features a humor all its own. The “Time-Freezy Hyper Slush” machine has a piece of paper taped to it that reads “Out of order — come back yesterday.” The mart also includes refrigerators that look ordinary, except for what hides inside: One case has a sign that reads “Fresh! Dinosaur eggs.” Inside are large spotted eggs, one of which is cracked with a tiny dinosaur peeking out from inside.
Another similar area, labeled “specialties,” houses a variety of unique reads, while another holds bottles labeled “anti-robot fluid,” which looks suspiciously like water.
If you ever despaired about not being able to possess your own robot, you need not grieve any longer. The stores let you “adopt” a robot, small creations with names like Sparklz and Spinney, that cost less than $20.
The store also supplies things like an evil-robot memory eraser — a small device meant to help with any robot gone rogue — and a decent supply of “robot emotions,” USBs meant to inject your robot with emotions like boredom and guilt. It’s a dream come true for any robot fanatic.
Though the store carries semi-normal goods, some household items get their own twist: If you want to try to time travel, the store carries “time-travel sickness pills” complete with specific dosages on the label, just like any other common medicine.
If it’s all too overwhelming and you can’t choose what to buy, the store offers surprise bags, which come in two sizes and hold various items from the store.
Besides offering a good laugh and some rare items to shoppers who swing by, the store also houses and supports 826LA, a non-profit writing and tutoring center that provides students with help when it comes to reading and writing everything from essays to fiction.
The center is part of 826 National, a program that was formed in San Francisco in 2002 by author Dave Eggers and educator Nínive Calegari, and the mart has a room in which tutoring sessions take place.
When you walk up to pay for your goods, you can browse through books containing work from the students in 826LA, as well as information for volunteering or internship involvement.
The back of the Echo Park Time Travel Mart separates the tutoring center from the store with a plastic curtain, creating a separate but united feeling between the unique store and the program. The locale also houses workshops tailored to certain age groups and each is constructed around a specific theme.
The mart’s connection to a supportive, enriching organization makes it even more of a hidden gem. Even if you don’t purchase anything, just walking around the store is highly entertaining, more so than any trip to your local mall or grocery store.
Turns out shopping doesn’t have to be so dull and predictable — and time travel doesn’t require a time machine, after all.
 
Echo Park Time Travel Mart is located on 1714 W. Sunset Blvd.

In developing a modern interpretation of Snow White with the cutting edge Ballet Preljocaj, artistic director and choreographer Angelin Preljocaj realized that the Snow White fable was one that had a generous amount of modern themes.
The conflict between the Queen and Snow White, for example, is representative of modern feminism; the events and conflicts of the play occur through the actions of a mother and a daughter, rather than through a traditional, ideal form of masculinity.
It’s this contemporary context that acts as the foundation of the libretto, creating what Preljocaj hoped would be a ballet that is modern yet magical, and something that is expressive rather than abstract. He wanted to bring back storytelling to modern ballet.
Updated fable · Nagisa Shirai (left) and Céline Galli (right) took center stage in a previous production of Snow White. Shirai, who also stars in the L.A. show, continues to impress in her execution of the stunning choreography. - Photo courtesy of JC Carbonne
Ballet Preljocaj’s Snow White premiered on Friday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, introducing American audiences to an expressionistic version of Snow White. The tale has certainly proven to be a viable fable for adaptation recently —  two cinematic versions of Snow White coming out in the near future shows the story’s unique versatility.
In Ballet Preljocaj’s version, there is more emphasis on the Queen’s desire to kill Snow White; Preljocaj believes the wicked stepmother is the central character of the tale, and her narcissistic determination to destroy her daughter is a psychoanalytical comment on modern feminism. With that in mind, the Queen, played with a fierce bravado by Gaëlle Chappaz, is shown as a villainous force of nature, strutting around in a dominatrix-inspired dress with two cat-minions following her every step.
That dress is of note: The costumes were designed by fashion legend Jean Paul Gaultier, who was the original “enfant terrible” of the fashion world and is also known for his costume designs for the 1997 French thriller The Fifth Element.
Gaultier worked closely with Preljocaj to keep the costumes in line with the storytelling quality of the play, and succeeds here: His work is so complementary to the dancers that the designs resemble an artist’s brushstrokes, giving the dancers a lightness that seems to let them float across the stage.
The choreography is sharp and pristine, giving it the fluid, humanist aesthetic of contemporary ballet but with the expressionism and emotion to accentuate the storytelling.
There’s a lovely and interesting sensuality in the characters, yet everything retains the grace of a Romantic-era painting. The music of Gustav Mahler also brings a romantic and hallowing quality to the performance, although it acts more as a complement than a driving force behind the melodic movements of the dancers.
The minimalist set design by Thierry Leproust is a sight to behold. Through the lighting, certain scenes feel like a painting coming to life; the scenes range from the futurist-abstract ballroom to the dark, yet beautiful forest.
One of the highlights is the dwarves’ mine: The seven dwarves dance in midair and sideways along the cavernous wall, creating a colorful spectacle that could only exist in modern ballet.
The character of Snow White, performed with cultivated perfection by Nagisa Shirai, is more seductive than in the common tale. Each of her transgressions are as much about her blossoming womanhood as they are about her feathery demeanor. Snow White’s costume is also revealing and angelic, and she is portrayed not simply as an object of obsession and desire but as an empowered pursuer of her own affections.
Two scenes in particular are so beautiful they are nearly transcendental. The climactic scene where the Queen, disguised as an old witch, gives the apple to Snow White, is treated as a battle for dominance, becoming more and more ferocious and primal. When the princess finally succumbs, the Queen stands over her, a true “Oedipus in reverse” that Preljocaj believes is instrumental to the fable’s modern feminist sensibilities.
And in the subsequent scene, the Prince (Fabrizo Clemente) tries desperately to bring Snow White back from the dead, dancing with her lifeless form.
Shirai’s body during this sequence moves with such fluidity and perfection that she seems more like an animated character than a human being. It is this level of physical perfection that demonstrates the true capabilities of modern ballet.
Ballet Preljocaj’s Snow White fable is graceful, powerful, sensual and heavenly.
With a renewed fascination in fairy tales and fables, Snow White stands as a unique, serene interpretation and a modern, avant-garde ballet — but one that never forgets to highlight the classic story that it’s built upon.

The Hunger Games deals with twisted subjects, such as survival of the fittest, rarely discussed in mainstream media.
It involves children being forced to brutally kill one another and details a violent world run by a ruthless government yet the film has somehow swept the nation in a craze of fandom.
Survival of the fittest · Elizabeth Banks (left) and Jennifer Lawrence (right) star in Gary Ross’ The Hunger Games, a film that critiques society as it calls a cruel and oppressive government into question. - Photo courtesy of Lionsgate
Beneath the violence and inhumanity of the film’s premise, though, lies the story of a heroine whose perseverance, resilience, compassion and self-discovery yield the rare capability to expose truth and catalyze meaningful action in anyone who sees the film.
Brilliantly directed by Gary Ross, The Hunger Games is set in the post-apocalyptic dystopian nation of Panem, comprised of 12 Districts under the cruel governing body known as the Capitol — the governing body that imposes an annual nationally televised event known as The Hunger Games in which one boy and one girl from each district must fight to the death, and only one can win.
Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a 16-year-old girl who lives in the poor and starving District 12, volunteers as a tribute in the Games in place of her younger sister Primrose. Katniss, along with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), the male tribute selected from District 12, are whisked off to the Capitol where they undergo training and mentorship from the drunken former Games champion Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) to prepare them for the immeasurable challenges of the games and help them win public favor.
But the Games are first and foremost a form of entertainment, so when Katniss and Peeta develop a friendship and hint at something more, the game-makers are quick to manipulate the rules to capitalize on this budding romance, further compromising and complicating the lives of the tributes and forcing Katniss to question everything she ever knew about sacrifice, survival, humanity and the world she is expected to accept.
From start to finish, The Hunger Games is mesmerizing.
The world of Panem is so estranged from our modern world, yet so many haunting aspects to that world parallel ours in a way that invites the viewer to truly analyze society in an unexpected, unprecedented way.
The parallel of the nationally televised Hunger Games with the prevalence of reality television in our society spotlights the frightening concept of taking pleasure in and celebrating the misfortune and pain of others — a notion that is rarely addressed in the modern media.
For those familiar with The Hunger Games trilogy, the film adheres faithfully to the books, leaving out a few minor details and not sacrificing any of the heart and integrity of the series.
Furthermore, the film adds a welcome dimension to the story that is not present in the book by intermittently cutting to the action at the Capitol and in the districts rather than remaining in Katniss’ viewpoint during the Games, which only enhances the story by displaying the implications of the Games throughout the nation rather than confining them to Katniss’ imagination.
And though The Hunger Games adheres to the series, certain aspects of the film might elude the grasp of those who are not familiar with the books.
The entire cast’s acting is superb, although Lawrence undoubtedly steals the show as heroine Katniss.
Lawrence, a lesser-known actress whose credentials include mostly independent films, commands the role of Katniss with mastery. She is able to impeccably marry the strength and confidence of the heroic Katniss with the humility and graciousness that are also paramount to her character.
It is all too common in this day and age that female characters intended to be heroines amount to nothing more than weak “damsel in distress” archetypes — for example, Twilight’s Bella Swan — usually balking at the first indication of trouble and caring about nothing more than falling in love.
Katniss Everdeen embodies everything the weak female stereotype lacks — strength, independence, self-confidence and courage — without losing an ounce of her femininity and appeal as she steals the hearts of Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta, as well as the affections of Panem.
One of USC’s own, sophomore film and theatre major Alexander Ludwig, makes an appearance in the film as Cato, the most fearsome of the tributes who has been preparing to compete in the Games his entire life.
For most of the Games, Cato appears impenetrable and unfazed — able and willing to kill anything and anyone who crosses his path.
Yet it is vital that the audience recognizes Cato is still human. Ludwig brings that humanity to the role through subtle yet immeasurably powerful moments, lending insight into the implications of this cruel government on the soul and humanity of these young people.
Hutcherson perfectly embodies the role of Peeta, capturing his charm, innocence, gentleness and courage that make it impossible not to adore and root for him alongside Katniss.
Through and through, The Hunger Games succeeds with flying colors.
The life-changing journey taken by every character in the film involving the juxtaposition of their humanity with the innate need to survive seeps into the viewer’s experience, making the impact of the film extend far beyond the two and a half hours it takes to watch.
Was the same premise the Tagline in the Schwarzeneggar Movie “Running Man” (1987)? Been there, Done that.
I guess “Everything Old is New Again”.

Before USC begins its stretch of Pac-12 play, the USC men’s tennis team will host one last nonconference opponent and hope to add yet another tally to their 38-match win streak.
The No. 1 Trojans (18-0) will take on No. 42 Boise State (16-5) today at 3 p.m. at Marks Stadium in USC’s effort to remain undefeated entering conference play, which begins Friday.
Streaking alongside his squad is No. 2 senior Steve Johnson, who remains undefeated in singles this year and has won 51 consecutive singles matches dating to last January.

“[Johnson] is a great example for everyone. We reflect and talk about it all the time — how hungry he is and how motivated he is,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “A lot of that comes with confidence and he’s extremely confident right now.”
Fellow senior Daniel Nguyen, who is ranked No. 16 in singles, is also in a groove with nine straight singles wins.
Besides the two seniors, USC features four other ranked players in singles, including sophomores Ray Sarmiento and Emilio Gomez — ranked No. 24 and No. 41, respectively — and freshmen Yannick Hanfmann and Roberto Quiroz, ranked No. 30 and No. 121, respectively.
In doubles action, Johnson and Hanfmann comprise the No. 6 duo in the nation, but Smith has recently featured a new combination of Johnson and Quiroz, who have won four in a row together.
“It was actually just an experiment at first, but it’s going pretty well,” Smith said. “We’ll have some very good options down the road.”
Nguyen and Sarmiento, however, have remained a constant pair and stand at No. 21 in the nation with a 17-4 record for the season.
With experience playing beside one another in the fall, Hanfmann and Gomez make up USC’s third pair and have gone 3-1 together in the dual match season.
USC’s 6-1 victory over No. 10 Florida last Monday marked the Trojans’ sixth win over a top-10 opponent.
Although the Trojans will face a weaker opponent in the Broncos, Smith insists there is no place for complacency on his team.
“In anything, if you ever think you’ve made it, you’re done,” Smith said. “You’re always on a journey upwards. Every single guy has a lot of things to work on.”
Boise State, riding an eight-game win streak, features two ranked singles players in No. 48 James Meredith and No. 55 Damian Hume.
The match against the Broncos will be USC’s last home match before kicking off conference play with a four-match road trip.
“It’s always special playing at home, but we’re going to take it like another match and continue to build and improve,” Sarmiento said.
The Trojans claim that their longstanding win streak dating to last February speaks to their high standards as a tennis power seeking their fourth consecutive NCAA championship in May.
“We won three [championships] in a row. This is nothing new to us,” Smith said. “There’s an expectation level here that is unlike any other school in the country.”
Thats not Steve he is not that good looking.  Scary man wins again.
You should proofread your photos…as I’m sure you got a lot of people writing in that the picture isn’t Steve Johnson….I think that is eric johnson?

The USC track and field team defended home ground during Saturday’s Trojan Invitational at Loker Stadium. The meet was not only the first outdoor event of the year to be held at USC, but the first to pit USC against more skilled competition consisting of teams ranked in the top 25.
The invitational was an important benchmark for the team in the outdoor season. Its performance gave an early idea as to how the squad might perform as the season goes on.
Taking first place in 12 different events, the team barely inched past rivals Oregon and Texas A&M, both of whom won 10 events. Texas A&M has defended the NCAA men’s outdoor title for the past three years and Oregon just recently won the NCAA women’s indoor title.
Regardless of past performances, these three teams dominated the invitational and regularly placed in the top three during both days of the meet. The competition remained close to the very end, culminating in the men’s 4×400-meter relay, a neck-and-neck battle between Texas A&M and USC that featured several dramatic lead changes.
Despite the intense competition, USC prevailed in the men’s 4×400-meter, simultaneously taking most event wins while preventing Texas A&M from tying for the same title. With that victory, the men’s 4×400-meter relay team (consisting of sophomore Josh Mance, junior Reggie Wyatt and seniors Joey Hughes and Bryshon Nellum) set a school record and world-leading time of 3:02.24 for the 2012 outdoor season.
Key victories for USC on the field included first-place finishes in both men’s and women’s long jump.
Junior Alitta Boyd won the women’s event while USC football wide receiver Marqise Lee won the men’s event. Freshman Melia Cox won the women’s triple jump, while fellow freshman Alexandra Collatz finished first in women’s discus throw. Freshman Daniel Szabo and senior captain Marissa Minderler both won the men’s and women’s hammer throw respectively.
USC also clinched several key victories on the track, a number of them over rival Texas A&M. Sophomore Aaron Brown took first place in the men’s 100-meter, although Texas A&M’s Dominique Duncan beat sophomore Loudia Laarman in the women’s 100-meter.
Senior Zsofia Erdelyi secured the first win for the Women of Troy, taking top honors in the women’s 3000-meter. Mance won the men’s 400-meter while Wyatt won the men’s 400-meter hurdles.
Great Job Trojan Track & Field Teams. Please come out and support our wonderful athletes.
Beating Oregon & Tax. a&m is huge.  Fight ON!

USC athletic director Pat Haden’s rationale for retaining men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill, despite a 6-26 record last season, has always been simple: His players go to class, graduate and keep their noses clean.
For months, he has reiterated as much.
Questions · USC coach Kevin O’Neill is known for running a clean program, but the arrests of two players are making that image blurred. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
“He graduates kids, and the kids don’t get into trouble,” Haden told the Los Angeles Times on March 7.
That remains, to a large degree, why O’Neill will return for a fourth season as head of the Trojans’ basketball program. And that’s more than fair. Running a clean program is nothing to scoff at.
But that general perception is fading.
Last month, junior forward Ari Stewart, who had been sitting out the season because of NCAA transfer rules, was arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in Arizona while traveling with the Trojans on a road trip. Charges are still pending after the case was referred to the Maricopa County attorney’s office last week.
Next season, Stewart will likely start for USC, along with incoming junior college transfer guard J.T. Terrell, who carries his own baggage, so to speak.
Terrell left Wake Forest in September after he was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated.
Neither charge is unheard of in today’s world of big-time college basketball, sure. Neither is exactly shocking.
But remember this is one of the primary reasons O’Neill is back: He runs a clean program and his players stay out of trouble. Yet, two players, with arrest records, could start for the Trojans when the season tips off come November. And that’s fine, but they better win. They can’t afford to wallow in mediocrity much longer.
The saving grace for O’Neill, who holds a rather pedestrian 41-55 mark in three seasons with USC, has been two-fold: He’s managed a mess in the wake of NCAA sanctions stemming from improper benefits former guard O.J. Mayo received while with the program in 2008, and his players have been high-character guys.
But Stewart and Terrell’s pasts devalue that latter notion and frustrate a growingly apathetic fanbase. Perhaps more than anything, they increase pressure on O’Neill to win in his fourth season, pressure that will only grow as the season draws nearer.
O’Neill said he expects things to turn around. He said USC will be markedly better in 2013, that the team’s performance from last season was, by and large, an anomaly.
“That will be our goal — To be in the NCAA tournament — and I think we have a chance,” O’Neill said about his team’s prospects following its season-ending 55-40 loss to UCLA in the Pac-12 tournament.
Haden has uttered similar statements.
After a six-win season, it’d be pretty tough not to recognize USC has to be better.
Coaches don’t typically get the benefit of the doubt forever. Eventually they have to win.
At some point, if O’Neill hopes to keep his job in the coming seasons, USC has to get back to the Big Dance. It can’t afford not to. He recognizes that. After all, USC loses money when it comes to basketball.
It suffered losses of $464,000 and $1.1 million, during the 2010-2011 and 2009-2010 seasons, respectively, according to the NCAA Equity in Athletics report. Data is not available for its most recent season.
Interest among alumni and students is waning too. USC averaged just 3,970 fans at the Galen Center last season — the lowest in the six-year history of the venue. All signs indicate general indifference among fans.
It all means one thing: USC can’t afford to slip up when it comes to graduation rates and run-ins with the law. There is little room left for error for O’Neill at this point. Brushes with the law are generally bad. That goes without saying for the most part. But they’re even worse when a program is coming off a school record for losses in a single season. It’s one thing to lose. It’s another thing to lose and have players arrested on drug charges in the middle of a roadtrip.
Eventually, O’Neill will be judged, to a large degree, on his record. How many games does he win? How much money can he help the program make?
But his clock is ticking, and unfortunately — at least for his job security — arrests and criminal charges only make it tick faster.

What Ari Stewart was arrested for isn’t even a crime in the state of California.
this season has made me sick.  I watch the big dance and get sicker. It amazes me that our coachescan’t find 4 decent players out of thousands who play this game in high schookl. what cAN WE DO.  hOWCOME NO ONE WITH ANY POWER AT T UNIV. GIVES A CRAP?
The administration has made it clear it could not care less about winning in basketball or about the fans/alums who do care about the program.
Frankly, this column also missed a major piece when KO’s own misadventures at the Pac-10 tournament were not mentioned.
Why is it acceptable for KO to get a fourth season? By his long history of complete mediocrity? He holds a sub .500 record after more than 400 games as a head coach, which is actually a difficult accomplishment in major college basketball with the state of non-conference schedules. He is not some young up-and-comer with some sort of promise. He’s failed at almost every head position he’s ever had outside of Marquette 20 years ago. He’s a divisive personality who most former players and fanbases despise. He refuses to practice any sort of offense and only believes in one defensive set. Attendance is completely down from its already subpar levels, the Galen Center is hemorrhaging money, and excitement is at an all-time low. All of this in the worst major conference in NCAA history.
the fact that our AD has made it explicit that only things that are important are “discipline and graduation” has its own problems. however, he hasn’t accomplished either of these either. 6 players have been run off, 6 players who will never have a USC degree. I fail to see the graduation of a single walk-on this year as any measure of success. We have completely given up on recruiting HS athletes because the coach publicly “doesn’t want to deal with them” anymore after the MD commit had the audacity to say he wanted to take  official visits to a few other schools, which was met with a pulling of his scholarship. 
I could go on for pages more.

On Saturday, the USC football team kicked off its first spring scrimmage at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Trojans are aiming to continue their early momentum from the early successes in spring practices.
USC coach Lane Kiffin announced that sophomore Tre Madden will stay at running back for the duration of spring practice.
Work in progress · Sophomore Tre Madden has been seeing time this spring at running back, although he was recruited as a linebacker. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“Madden did some special things,” Kiffin said. “The ability to stay up at 225 pounds with that forward lean, and then you see the speed from a big guy too.”
Madden originally came to USC with the intentions of being a linebacker for the Trojans. During the 2011 season, he recorded 15 tackles for the Trojans.
 
Redshirt freshman quarterback Max Wittek is becoming more comfortable during spring practices.
“I feel great and I feel very comfortable with my decisions and my reads,” Wittek said.
Though his first pass was deflected, Wittek moved forward with a positive attitude.
“He got his hand up in the passing lane and made a great play and was able to pick it off,” Wittek said. “I just put it behind me and said let’s move forward from there.
 
Offensively, the Trojan roster has endured woes during spring workouts. A full scrimmage could not be run because of the fact that offensive numbers were too low. Despite a low turnout because of injuries, transfers and players participating in track, Kiffin remained optimistic about the offense’s performance on Saturday.
“The offense did a lot better than I thought they would have with the personnel out there, so that was good to see,” Kiffin said.
Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee chose to forgo Saturday’s practice to represent the Trojans in the Trojan Invitational at Loker Stadium. Lee was victorious in the men’s long jump.
Junior cornerback Nickell Robey, who would have competed against Lee, chose to attend football practice instead.
“I made the right choice for myself by coming out here with my team,” Robey said. “I’m a competitor, so I’ll be a little disappointed. But this is for the team, so I had to put my personal problems out of the way.”
 
Many of the Trojans’ top performers were unable to participate in Saturday’s scrimmage because of numerous injuries. Redshirt freshman running back Javorious Allen (hamstring), redshirt sophomore quarterback Jesse Scroggins (hip), sophomore wide receiver George Farmer (hamstring), and senior center Khaled Holmes (calf) did not practice on Saturday. Tight ends Xavier Grimble (toe) and Randall Telfer (hamstring), both redshirt sophomores, did not practice, while redshirt sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey was limited. Redshirt freshman fullback Soma Vainuku injured his back during Saturday’s practice at the Coliseum.
Kiffin believes that most of the injured players will return to practice on Tuesday.
The Trojans will continue spring practice culminating in the annual spring football game, which will be held in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday, April 14.

The No. 2 USC men’s volleyball team beat visiting George Mason University Patriots in straight sets by scores of 25-18, 25-16 and 25-21 in front of a raucous crowd in the North Gym on Friday.
“The first set was sloppy but we picked it up,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “We’ve been focusing too much on the score and not the quality of play. We talked about our internal scoreboard after the first set and it showed in how focused we played.”
Never in doubt · Senior middle blocker Steven Shandirck and the Trojans swept George Mason in straight sets at the North Gym. played its home matches there until 2006. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
This was the Trojans’ first time playing in the Physical Education Building’s North Gym since 2006. It was the team’s original gym from 1970-1988 and sporadically from 1997-2006. The Trojans will play their next two matches in the North Gym.
“It’s important that we got used to the venue and got closer to our roots,” Ferguson said. “I had a mile-long email chain from a bunch of alumni after they found out we were returning to the North Gym sharing old pictures.”
The Trojans won their 11th straight match to improve to a 16-4 overall mark, 13-4 in-conference, while the Patriots fell to 7-12 overall.
The Trojans rested starters junior opposite hitter Maddison McKibbin and sophomore libero Henry Cassiday.
“We had a good level of focus and we were careful not to take them lightly,” senior middle blocker and co-captain Steven Shandrick said. “It was important that the reserves held themselves to the same high standard as the starters would, and it was good that we could beat them in three.”
Senior outside hitter and co-captain Tony Ciarelli led the charge with 13 kills and two aces. Redshirt sophomore opposite hitter Tanner Jansen followed with nine kills and three aces.
“It’s been good working on connecting with the guys better and I feel like our team chemistry has improved,” freshman setter Micah Christensen said.
The Trojans won in dominating fashion offensively, defensively and from the service line. The Trojans hit .273 and held the Patriots to a .014 clip, had 10.5 blocks to George Mason’s six and served 10 aces to Mason’s four.
“I’m pleased with the serving and our overall focus,” Ferguson said. “But we need to get [freshman middle blocker Robert] Feathers and Shandrick the ball more because they had only five and three attempts, respectively.”
Ferguson was also presented before the game with an honorary game ball to commemorate his  100th career win from the March 16 match against UC Santa Barbara.
good job guys…..Keep the Focus and lets beat Pacific & The Farm this weekend. WE CAN DO THIS!!!!
Eyes on the PRIZE!  Final 4 is at Galen…we gotta be there..
Keep on Dancing,
Fight ON!

Support the Half in Ten bill to help Los Angeles’ poor. 
As a social worker at the Good Shepherd Center serving the homeless women and children of Los Angeles, I have seen dozens of people who are newly homeless at age 50.
Many people have paid their own way their whole lives, only to be laid off a decade away from retirement.
Their 401(k) retirement accounts are now nearly worthless because of the economic situation, and because their unemployment benefits didn’t last long enough to help them weather the recession, they have had to spend their retirement money regardless of the heavy penalties on that money for early withdrawal.
Current figures of unemployment in the country are starting to drop, which may indicate to some people in the country that the fight is over.
But for the people of Los Angeles, this is going to be a long, hard slog. We’ve been looking at high unemployment rates  for years.
The formula for computing poverty was developed in the 1960s, and it is now out of date. Rent, gas and health insurance are our biggest expenses and the current poverty line is based solely on the cost of food.
This calculation error translates to a population that is underserved by the safety net meant to help them get through economic downturns and personal hardship.
The Half in Ten bill hopes to fix that and many other issues by extending broad reforms to the service workforce that makes up such a huge percentage of the working poor in America. These are the people with multiple jobs paying high rates for child care, insurance and rent in an economy that is just starting to produce tangible results for the people who need it the most.
The bill mandates affordable child care, flexible schedules for families with children, extending federal aid to our beleaguered state college system and providing more public sector jobs.
It also provides more money for public works projects in the short term to help the economy transition during this fragile time, while providing funding toward recalibrating the poverty measure.
Many representatives in Congress are already cosponsoring this bill.
Nevertheless, our senators need to be reminded of the pressing nature of the economic problems here in Los Angeles.

Male condoms, like penises, come in many different shapes and sizes. Some are longer, shorter, wider or thinner.
So why do condoms have a bad “wrap?”
We’ve all heard the excuses: They’re annoying, uncomfortable, expensive and even unnecessary when coupled with oral contraceptives.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
In a study of college women from a Southern Californian university, “Negative attitudes (61 percent) about condoms were … demonstrated as a key factor in the lack of condom use.”
That number needs to be lower.
Though there are hurdles to overcome with almost every form of contraception, when condoms are used correctly, their benefits outweigh the so-called hassle.
According to the Mayo Clinic, with correct use, male condoms should fail only 2 percent of the time; in practice, they fail 14-15 percent of the time. Though this method is not perfect, it is an effective way to lower your risk of pregnancy and contracting sexually transmitted infections. And the more you know about condom use, the lower your risk.
With the addition of spermicide or oral contraceptives, condoms are a great way to further prevent pregnancy. Still, students should remember that neither spermicide nor oral contraceptives protect against sexually transmitted diseases when used alone.
If condoms are so reliable, why do people complain about them?
Many people say that the condom falls off during intercourse. In that case, most likely, the condom isn’t fitting properly. It’s up to you and your partner to decide what works best.
Most condoms are made of latex. If you are allergic to latex — or if you suspect you might be because of reactions after use — you can also find equally effective condoms that are made of polyurethane.
As for others that say sex with a condom “doesn’t feel as good,” they should consider if herpes or a baby are worth the risk. If two people are in a committed relationship and both regularly test negative for STIs, they might reasonably choose to have sexual intercourse without a condom, but they should use another means to prevent pregnancy.
Condom manufacturers have also made condoms less of a buzz kill by adding lubricants and textured exteriors to condoms. Using more lubrication also helps prevent minor tears in the tissue caused by friction, further reducing the risk of STIs.
Finally, many people are uncomfortable with the idea of putting on a condom, saying it is “weird” or that it “ruins the heat of the moment.” But you can avoid awkward fumbling by becoming more familiar with condoms. Practice putting condoms on in a non-sexual context. Who’s to know?
Contrary to popular opinion, men aren’t the only ones who need practice in this area. If you are female, see what it feels like to correctly insert and remove a female condom.
As for killing the mood, get creative and incorporate the condom into foreplay. Believe it or not, condoms don’t need to be a turn off. They can actually be a turn-on.
Condoms should be given a fair chance in the arena of contraceptives. Before you write them off, experiment with your options — and have fun in the process.

Max Rubin–that cartoon is amazing! Natalie, Brook and Lucas–I think I may have met two of you or your coworkers when I interviewed Paula Swinford the Director of USC Health and Wellness in January about the LA Condom Mandate. You all bring up good points about the right of partners to choose how they want to engage in sexual intercourse. Some people may feel they are unnecessary if they know their partner’s STI status or wish to become pregnant or are using birth control. The decision ought to be left to the female and the male to choose.
there is a perfect solution for fit called TheyFit – they make condoms in 95 different sizes, all combinations of length and width. 
It’s not enough to say small/medium/large as some men are long but narrow, some are short but wide – and all the other variations in-between! I used to use Trojan but switched to a custom size of TheyFit and boy, what a difference :-) http://www.theyfit.com highly recommended
John, 
I read that TheyFit condoms have not been approved (by the FDA) in the US and technically cannot even be sold in the US.  
I will trust my STI protection and pregnancy prevention to a different brand until this changes!
This is a great and very necessary article. We applaud you for getting this message out.
You are absolutely correct the majority of condom failures are due to men wearing the wrong size condom.
(You mean there are different condom sizes? Why yes, there are.)  
Accurate condom sizing is critical for safety and pleasure! 
When a condom is too small for a man at best he feels discomfort and loses his erection, at worst, the condom breaks. (He needs a larger condom.) When a condom is too large for a man at best it slips and slides, at worst leaking occurs or it comes off entirely. (He needs a “standard” condom or he requires a smaller condom.) Whether too big or too small, the man is focused on his discomfort. Both pleasure and safety are severely compromised.
Anyhow, our site: LuckyBloke.com can help you determine what size condoms you need.
After that, you can explore the many options available for your size.
For readers that would like to know more about condom sizing, check this article out:
