Justin Chapman | Daily TrojanA secular affair · Bart Campolo, whose father was Bill Clinton’s spiritual adviser, serves as chaplain and adviser of the Secular Student Fellowship.
The USC campus boasts more than 80 religious organizations for students, with chaplains to supervise nearly all of them, but only one caters to the ever-growing community of nonbelievers.
The Secular Student Fellowship of USC, which meets at 7 p.m. every Monday in room 203B at the University Religious Center, is a “friendly, diverse community of undergraduates and graduate students engaged in an ongoing conversation about how to apply reason and science to live better lives and build better societies,” according to its page on the Office of Religious Life’s website. The group’s adviser is Bart Campolo, USC’s first Humanist Chaplain, a volunteer position he created two years ago.
In his role as Humanist Chaplain, Campolo counsels students who don’t believe in God. He is on campus most days of the week, in his office at URC 203A. On any given day he interacts with about three or four students.
“I’m like the rabbi/priest/minister/imam to all the students who don’t believe in God,” Campolo said. “If someone’s dad gets diagnosed with cancer and they’re trying to make sense of it, or someone’s having a hard time making friends on campus, or a senior doesn’t know what they’re going to do after they graduate, they come talk to me.”
Campolo, 53, is the son of famous evangelical preacher Tony Campolo, who served as former President Bill Clinton’s spiritual adviser. Bart Campolo himself spent many years as a public and influential evangelical Christian leader, but began having doubts about his own faith. After suffering a concussion from a bike accident, he decided at age 51 that he no longer believed in God. He has since devoted himself to secular humanism, which he defines as “creating a community where people pursue love and goodness collectively on the basis of reason.”
“My position is supervised by the dean of religious life because he wants me here,” Campolo said. “The dean understands that I’m trying to help students answer some of life’s ultimate questions using science and reason instead of supernaturalism, but that I’m still a religious leader. I’m still pursuing: ‘Where do we come from? What happens when we die? What’s the basis of good and evil? What makes something right or wrong? How do you make the most of this life? How do you deal with your finitude in the midst of a huge universe?’”
A recent Pew Research Center study found that more Americans than ever are increasingly becoming less religious, especially millennials. While no data currently exists for how many people on campus are religious versus nonreligious according to the Office of Religious Life, Campolo said his anecdotal experience tells him that about half of the students he talks to around campus don’t identify with a religion or don’t believe in God.
“How many people here believe in a magical god who actually intervenes in the lives of human beings? I’m going to guess about 40 to 50 percent,” Campolo said. “USC tends to skew more towards the religious, and yet, the faculty is a whole other story. Very few professors are people of faith, and yet very many of them are professors because they want to contribute to the advancement of life.”
Campolo said that his goal on campus is not to criticize religions or religious people, but rather to create a positive community for those who don’t happen to believe in God.
“A lot of atheist groups I researched had very negative agendas,” said Campolo. “They were like, ‘Let’s talk about another reason it’s stupid to believe in God,’ or ‘Let’s really focus on the separation of church and state because I’m sick of ‘In God we trust’ on the currency.’ You can’t build a movement around all this negative stuff. Ridiculing religion only gets people to double down. Maybe it’d be better if we go build a community where people could pursue love and goodness in a rational way and don’t have to believe in anything.”
Now in his third year as Humanist Chaplain, Campolo has found that many students are discovering and valuing his services.
“USC is a big, busy place,” Campolo said. “A lot of people don’t feel like they have a lot of friends on campus. They don’t feel connected. They don’t feel like anybody really cares.”
That’s why Campolo and his wife started hosting dinners for the secular community on campus in the URC dining room every other Sunday, a tradition that continues this semester.
“Since ‘non-religious’ is the fastest growing demographic in the United States, we think it’s important that a community like this exists to bring us together to pursue goodness without a god, which for many people is a novel concept,” said Katie Bolton, a junior majoring in environmental studies and NGOs and social change who serves as one of the leaders of the Secular Student Fellowship. “Bart is a true pioneer of this movement; he is able to inspire people like few others. I hope that more people will have the chance to know him like I do, because he has something to offer everyone. He just beams goodness to all who cross his path.”
Fellow SSF leader Joseph Krieger, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering, said having a Humanist Chaplain and a secular student organization on campus is “a huge comfort.”
“There are so many people on campus who don’t believe in a god, but want to have conversations about how to make the world a better place, either through improving interpersonal relationships or supporting causes that we believe in,” Krieger said. “Bart’s intuition, foresight and understanding of how people think make him a master of relationships.”
Campolo is also working with Irshad Manji, a senior fellow at the USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy, to create a chapter of her Moral Courage Project on campus.
Filmmaker John Wright is currently wrapping up a documentary about Campolo’s relationship with his father Tony following the revelation that he was no longer a Christian. The film, With Whom I Am Well Pleased, is expected to be released by the end of the year. The two Campolos are also working on a book together based on the same idea, due out early next year.
“All these religions have endured for thousands of years, not because their narratives make any sense at all, because they don’t, but because they get together every week, they have cool rituals, they sing really well and they take care of each other,” Campolo said. “They endure despite their crazy narratives, not because of them. Secular humanists have a much better narrative, and every fact that gets discovered affirms that narrative. But we’ve got to build a better community.”

The USC Center for Body Computing and the USC Roski Eye Institute teamed up with nationwide eye care insurer Vision Service Plan to create a wearable technology for improving fitness that works through a participant’s glasses. The pilot study, which kicked off Aug. 27, outfitted USC staff with the eyewear as well as an app, known as Level, developed in conjunction with VSP’s Global Innovation Lab.
The glasses seem like a standard pair at first glance, said Andrew Kiebel, a digital health fellow at the CBC who worked on the project. However, high-tech additions such as Bluetooth connectivity and a strong battery are all built into the eyewear. 
“These [features] can track your step count, your calories burned, your activity time, and your distance traveled,” Kiebel said. “It can pretty much do all the same measurement that are most common for those in leading fitness.”
The app, which has a “find my glasses” function as well as a social network, engages users by making their progress available to others who can monitor and encourage them. The biggest job the app has is to further VSP’s charity initiative, Eyes of Hope. 
“The Bluetooth syncs with an app on your phone, which sinks with VSP, and their charity Eyes of Hope,” Kiebel said. “Through that, every time a participant accrues enough steps for daily points to achieve a goal they’ve decided for themselves, it will trigger a donation for a comprehensive eye exam and eye glasses to someone in need through VSP’s charity initiative.” 
Users can select one of four charities that support veterans, the homeless, school-aged children or senior citizens. Once their goal is reached, they can redeem their points to send eye exams and glasses to those impacted by their charity of choice.
“This incentive not only motivates me to be more proactive, but it helps to know every step is towards a deeper meaning of humanity,” said Albert Jacobs, a participant in the study who works for the Ostrow School of Dentistry at USC.
 The solution does not accommodate everyone. If an individual wears contact lenses, or does not need glasses at all, there is no way for him or her to participate.
“My prescription is so high, I choose to wear contacts because it’s easier at work,” said Dr. Gloria Chiu, an assistant professor of clinical ophthalmology and the chief optometrist at the USC Roski Eye Institute. “Right now, because it’s a pilot study, they’re focusing on people who need to wear glasses so that they collect more data. People who have a prescription need their glasses in order to see, drive and go to work.”
The study has been looking into alternatives for people who cannot wear the glasses, but as of now they have not found any. Chiu proposed modifying the technology to work for sunglasses, but admitted that this idea has its own flaws.
“The problem is if you’re walking inside, or at the gym, you might not want to wear your glasses,” Chiu said. “It kind of defeats the purpose of tracking all of your activity if you don’t wear your sunglasses most of the time.”
Still, Chiu saw the glasses as an improvement on traditional wrist-worn technologies, as a bracelet can be forgotten at home when the wearer is in a rush, but eyeglasses are essential. Researchers also said that this wearable technology’s location on the body makes the eyewear ideal for data collection.
“Because of its positioning on the head, which is the center of gravity, it gives a different context of data compared to wrist worn centers,” Kiebler said. “In the future, hopefully it should give us some information on gait and posture.”
Jacobs said that participating in the study allowed him a closer look at an innovation that may become commonly used in the future because of its convenience for the wearer. 
“Placing a fitness tracking device inside a pair of eyewear frames is pure genius,” Jacobs said. “I’m forced to wear glasses regularly because of my bad eyesight, so why not add a device that tracks my steps and calories burned?”
Kiebel said that although the project’s charitable aspirations — which no other wearable device is incorporating at the moment — make it stand out, its technological prowess truly sets it apart from other developments in this area. 
“I think it really demonstrates USC’s commitment to research and innovation,” Kiebel said. “It shows how USC is really on the frontier and forefront, and is really committed to the novel technology developed in the field right now.”

Almost 40 percent of the freshman class at USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering are women. The rest of the world, however, isn’t nearly as close to equality in tech industries. Panelists discussed this lack of equal representation after a screening of the documentary CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap at the Ray Stark Family Theatre on Wednesday.
The film traced the history of women in U.S. tech industries and the gradual decline of women graduates in mathematics in the 1980s. The panel featured Robin Hauser Reynolds, the director of the documentary, Viterbi professors Shirin Laor-Raz Salemnia, Trina Gregory and Rob Parke and Karen Wilkins-Mickey, senior manager of inclusion strategies at Expedia, Inc. The panelists talked about their personal experiences with sexism and gender disparity in the workspace.
“When the film first came out, I was so happy that someone was finally showing things that occur daily in the workspace,” Shirin Laor-Raz Salemnia said. “When I come out and say it, I’m just one person … But when you’re watching a movie about it, it becomes something much greater.” 
Some students feel that though efforts have been made to encourage women to join computer science, the disparity between genders here on campus is still an issue.
“I just came from a class where there were probably four girls in a class of like 35 students,” said Nandhini Sivam, a sophomore majoring in computer science. “There’s definitely a gap and it’s closing. I know that it’s closing, because we have like three clubs on campus: Women in Computing, Girls in Tech and [Society for Women Engineers], so it’s definitely closing but not quite there yet.”
Other students feel that the lack of diversity in engineering is not just a social issue, but could potentially prevent coding from progressing.
“I’m a firm believer that if you have diversity of people in a field, you also have a diversity of approaches and ideas that can come out,” said Adam Espinoza, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration. “ [A greater] representation of women and POC can provide insights and possible solutions to common problems … because to minorities, the injustices are more profound, so minorities are more likely to fix things through the fields that they’re engaged in.”
CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap was created in order to explore the lack of diversity within coding and portray it as something engaging, creative and rewarding, according to the film’s website. This feature film hopes that by exposing audiences to girls who code, the fear of joining the male-dominated technology industry will dissipate.
“It’s not something that’s hard to do,” Sivam said. “It’s a matter of exposure and what’s portrayed in public media. There’s a lot more guys: male CEOs of these big companies, and you don’t really see women computing in the news; There’s never really a breakthrough that’s publicized as a woman figuring it out.”
Viterbi consists of 13.5 percent female faculty, 1.5 percent below the national average at engineering schools, said Amy Blumenthal, a spokesperson for Viterbi. However, the school is implementing programs locally and nationwide in order to even out the gender gap. 
These efforts include the creation of the Institute of Engineering Community and Cultural Competence, also known as IEC3, which encourages girls from K-12 to cultivate an interest in code. Last year, Dean of Viterbi Yannis C. Yortsos spearheaded an effort targeted at the White House to encourage deans from engineering schools to commit to diversity. More than 170 deans have signed this pledge at this point. The school has also made an effort to get a TV show made about a female engineer background. 
“We’re really changing the model,” Laor-Raz Salamenia said. “Here at USC, we’re very adamant about getting everyone into engineering…It shouldn’t be an issue of gender. We don’t live in a bubble of girls only, boys only.”

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanFreshman phenom · Freshman Khalia Lanier has made an immediate impact for the Trojans. The outside hitter notched 50 kills and 38 digs at the USC Radisson Classic, earning her MVP honors for the tournament.
The No. 24 USC Women’s Volleyball team rebounded from their tough start the first weekend of matches. The team won the USC Radisson Classic, improving their overall record to 3-3. The Women of Troy swept No. 23 Kentucky in three sets (25-20, 32-30, 27-25), Northern Iowa State in four sets (25-21, 25-21, 24-26, 25-23) and No. 22 Creighton in five sets (25-27, 25-23, 25-22, 19-25, 15-10). 
“I like the fact that we came back and fought,” head coach Mick Haley said. 
Along with claiming the tournament crown, USC had three players make the all-tournament team. Freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier was the tournament’s Most Valuable Player and joined by senior middle blocker Elise Ruddins and senior libero Taylor Whittingham on the all-tournament team. 
“You talk about freshmen coming in and making an impact,” Haley said. “And she’s been really, really good.”
Lanier put up 50 kills over the weekend and recorded 38 digs. Lanier has put up four double-doubles in five matches (three consecutively). Against Creighton, she had a season-high of 21 kills, 17 digs and 24.0 points.
“She’s carried a heavy load,” Haley said. “But she’s a good one, no question.”
During practices last week, one of Haley’s goals for the team was to reduce their number of hitting and serving errors. In the Radisson Invitational, they reduced their errors by roughly a third. 
“That’s why we felt like we were successful,” Haley said. “But, we need to reduce them a lot more.”
Along with continuing to reduce errors, Haley wants the team to be better at attacking when they’re out of their system, meaning he wants the team to always look for the kill even when they can’t run their set plays. Just because a setter received the first ball or they don’t get the best pass off their opponents’ hit doesn’t mean the point is lost. 
“We’re trying to get our hitters to be more kill-oriented off of the high balls,” Haley said. “We don’t like to play slow but sometimes we have to.”
Senior setter Alexa Strange, two-time national champion and All-American with the USC beach volleyball team, decided to leave the team for her final semester at USC. 
“I tried to get her to stay but I think she’s focused on getting her degree,” Haley said. “She always plays with a fire, and that’s what we lose from [her leaving].”
As the Women of Troy head out to Houston, it’ll be their first matches away from home. 
“That’s probably the first crowd that will be kind of an anti-crowd because we’ve played at home all year,” Haley said. “So we’ll see how we adjust to that.”
Despite playing on the road, Haley’s goals for the team remain basically the same.
“We’d like to come out of there 3-0. Of course that’s important,” Haley said. “We would like to be able to handle the other teams.”
The Women of Troy kick-off the Rice Adidas Invitational against Sam Houston State (4-3) Friday, and Oakland (4-3) and Rice (3-4) on Saturday.

In his monthly State of Troy address on Wednesday, Athletic Director Lynn Swann offered encouragement following USC’s blowout opening season loss to Alabama. 
Swann said that the disparity on the scoreboard — the Crimson Tide won 52-6 — last Saturday was a result of mistakes, missed assignments and Alabama’s talent.
“One game, especially the first game, does not make a season and does not break a season,” Swann said. “Everyone in the Trojan Family would have liked to have been on the right side of an upset win over the No. 1 team in the country, but we are a better football team than the score indicated.”
Swann, who is just a few months into his tenure as Athletic Director after taking over from the retired Pat Haden in July, said the team’s goal is still to win the Pac-12 conference and be in Rose Bowl contention. 
“You find the resolve to come back and play the next week,” Swann said. “We always learn more from the difficult things we endure in life than the easy wins. We celebrate the victories, but we learn from the mistakes.” 
Swann noted that the mistakes made last Saturday are correctable, and that college football teams usually see improvements in between the season’s first and third games. 
USC plays Utah State on Saturday. The Trojans are 16-point favorites to win their home opener and have not lost to a team from the Mountain West Conference since 1992. 
“We are looking for a lot of improvement in terms of assignments, not making mistakes and playing better football in the second game of the season against Utah State,” Swann said.

Photo courtesy Sports Information“A whole new level” · Redshirt senior Sammy Jo Prudhomme earned Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Week honors last week after consecutive shutouts.
Consistency will be key for the women’s soccer team as the Trojans gear up for one of their last weekends of non-conference play against Loyola Marymount and North Carolina. 
After sweeping the Auburn Classic with road victories over Georgia and Auburn last weekend, the team’s confidence is at its highest of the season. The Trojans started the tourney with a 3-0 victory against Georgia in the midst of smothering Southern heat, then grinded for a 2-0 win over Auburn two days later.
At the forefront of the Trojans’ success was redshirt senior Sammy Jo Prudhomme, who tallied nine saves against Georgia and eight against Auburn. This is Prudhomme’s second year as starting keeper, and head coach Keidane McAlpine believes this is the best he has seen her in her USC career.
“We’ve seen a whole new level from Sammy Jo this year,” McAlpine said. “She’s sharp and she’s continuously coming up with big saves when we need her game in and game out. This is the most locked in I’ve ever seen her.”
Prudhomme’s performance cemented a growing weekend for a young backline, which remained something of a question mark for McAlpine heading into both games in Georgia. Last year, his squad’s style of play was defined from the get-go — defense first, giving more time and breathing room to an offensive front line that often struggled to convert opportunities into points.
This year, that isn’t quite the case. A less-experienced defense has forced Prudhomme to step up as a vocal leader on the pitch to organize her line. At the same time, a fresh set of strikers have brought efficiency in finishing to the Trojans’ front line, resulting in higher scoring matches early in the season. 
McAlpine has seen the team’s ratio of finishes to opportunities — known as a “strike rate” — drop to one-to-five or one-to-four so far this season. Last year, he would’ve placed that ratio closer to one-to-10.
“Last year we created a lot of chances, but this year we’re turning that into actual goals,” McAlpine said. “We’re seeing the chemistry in our partnerships form, and that’s helping us with growing and playing consistently as a unit.”
At this point, it comes down to chemistry and consistency on both sides of the ball. McAlpine’s squad has seen more depth of players scoring and creating opportunities in the box. Six different Trojans have found the back of the net so far, with redshirt junior Alex Anthony leading the team after 3 goals in three separate games. 
This balanced attack is reassuring to McAlpine, but he feels that the team isn’t quite a finished product yet. His main goal is to develop a more consistent team that is more able to attack and pressure for a full 90 minutes.
“Right now, we’ll have that consistency for 15 or 20 minutes at a time,” McAlpine said. “And in those 15 or 20 minutes, we’ll look really good. But we’re not holding that level of play for an entire game, and we haven’t started our second halves well. Once we’re doing that, once we’re [playing] with that consistency, I think you’ll really see it start to come together.”
That consistency will be necessary in this upcoming weekend, particularly against a stacked No. 8 North Carolina team that has yet to give up a match this season. Last year, the teams faced off in a hard-fought match that ended in a 2-1 loss for the Trojans. But the game was considered a turning point for the 2015 season, after which the Trojans went on a six-game streak without a loss.
This year, however, the Trojans aren’t settling for anything but victory. North Carolina is esteemed as one of the great powerhouses of women’s collegiate soccer, but McAlpine feels that his strengthened frontline and veteran keeper have the confidence and energy level to match the Tar Heels. The high pressure game will be yet another barometer for McAlpine to test how ready his team is for this year’s regular season.
“Our energy level is up a lot the past few weeks,” McAlpine said. “I think the players feel good about the offense and several clean sheets in a row is giving them confidence. They know there’s things to work on, but they’re looking forward to this weekend. They know they can get in there and play with the best, and they’re going to have a good time with it.”

Nick Saban has not been afraid to discipline players despite ongoing investigations – Photo courtesy of Library of Congress
When head coach Clay Helton was hired, there was a sigh of relief from fans who expected him to be the one to clean up the football program. Ever since the Reggie Bush debacle sent USC into a full-blown tailspin it has yet to recover from, there have been innumerable issues including the arrest and suspension of former tight end Bryce Dixon for second-degree robbery and the suspension of former cornerback Josh Shaw who lied about the cause of injuries sustained from leaping from a balcony.
Helton is not this type of guy. He is a down-to-earth, blue-collar coach who I expected to instill a strong sense of moral obligation to the University and a dedicated work ethic.
Of course, the blame for this year’s incidents does not solely fall on the shoulders of Helton, but the tone is set at the top and Helton has the power to make an impression on the young Men of Troy.
Already this year, four football players have been suspended. Cornerback Isaiah Langley did not play in the Alabama game, serving a suspension rendered in July after Langley was arrested for suspicion of trespassing, intoxication and resisting arrest at a fraternity party at UCLA in May. Langley was disciplined later in the month for violating team rules.
In Saturday’s game against Alabama, linebacker Jabari Ruffin was ejected immediately after he stomped on Alabama player Minkah Fitzpatrick’s groin. His punishment for this offense — a suspension for the first half of the game against Utah State and a required letter of apology. I would love to read the letter from the guy who has been on circulating videos from SportsCenter of the “Top 10 Cheap Shots of All Time.”
More notably, linebacker Osa Masina and defensive end Don Hill have been suspended for both the Alabama game and the Utah State game for their involvement in sexual assault investigations. Both are allowed to practice with the team and attend their classes. Given the sensitivity of this particular accusation, this is the area where discipline enters a gray area. It would be easy to take one side or the other and say that clearly these two players need to be disciplined more harshly, or that they have the right to be treated as normal citizens because they are innocent until proven guilty.
I do not think the answer is as clear cut.
In all of these situations, the argument could be made that Helton has missed his chance to come in as a new coach and set a strict tone of what is and is not acceptable, but Helton hasn’t done anything that isn’t considered standard protocol across college football.
In comparison with Alabama, the top team in the country this year and several years running, there has been an equally disturbing trend of crime among football players, but half-hearted disciplinary measures.
Alabama’s All-SEC left tackle Cam Robinson was arrested on drug and weapons charges in May, but the case was dropped by the district attorney citing insufficient evidence. After what head coach Nick Saban described as internal discipline, Robinson played in the season opener against USC last weekend. He was even named one of the 10 impact players for Alabama by their coaching staff. However, even though the charges were dropped eventually, Robinson was suspended indefinitely by the football team, proving that just because the university says the athlete is allowed to attend class does not mean the team is required to keep him around.
Alabama indefinitely suspended another player, Alphonse Taylor, after he was arrested and charged with drunk driving in July. In August, Saban allowed Taylor to begin practicing with the team, and he served a one-game suspension last weekend, and is now eligible to compete for a starting spot.
While many may argue that these punishments are not severe enough, the main difference I would like to highlight between Alabama’s handling of their disciplinary matters and USC’s is that with Alabama, the players were suspended indefinitely before their charges were fully processed, whereas USC responds with allowing two men accused of rape to practice with the rest of the team.
Just because they have not been found guilty does not mean they are people who should be representing the University. Athletes should be held to a higher standard than regular students because they are in a more high-profile situation where outsiders automatically associate the quality of the university based on the football team. It also hurts the situation of other football players and athletes, most of whom are normal, kind and morally responsible people.
I admire the bravery of Nick Saban to suspend some of his star players just because of the association between the athlete and the crime. When the facts are settled and the dust has cleared, Saban still has the wherewithal to adjust the punishment as necessary, but removing the athlete from the team for an indefinite amount of time is the better option for the team as a whole.

What goes on in team meetings is extremely important. This is a team, not a group of individuals and what one does, it reflects on everyone else. The coach is responsible for everything that his players do and his response to a breach of team rules reverberates throughout the program. I’m a firm believer in “platoon discipline” as a means to make everyone keep things moving in the right direction. Running the whole team for 2 hours before practice when one member screws up will bring out the internal discipline that even the coach can’t administer. Create a team that disciplines itself and the coach can concentrate on the details.
what a horrible article. So 2 Alabama players are arrested for drug and weapon charges. Smoking weed in a car, with a gun on their lap. Charges are filed, but prosecutor decides not to prosecute them because he “refuses to ruin the lives of two young men who have spent their adolescence and their teenage years working and sweating while we were all home in the air conditioning.” So basically, the only reason they aren’t in jail is because they are football players. Drugs and guns while driving a car, guilty as can be, yet Saban plays them in week 1. And you “admire” this coach because he “suspended the players indefinitely” for a couple days until the prosecutor dropped the charges, admittedly, for no good reason? Does that make any sense, honey?
Heltons hands are tied with Masina not because “innocent until proven guilty” but because he hasn’t even been charged. The school is allowing him to attend classes. So you are all upset that Helton allows the guy on football field for 2 hours a day, without a women in site… Yet the USC administrators allow him to sit in class next to female USC students all he wants, and you have no concerns with that? Again, how does that make any sense?
The funny thing about your article and about the whole situation is that if Osa Masina was on Bama with your “admired” cosch saban, not only would he not be suspended, but he would have PLAYED in their first game – under the same logic that he used before. It’s been weeks since the story broke and the player still hasn’t been charged with a crime. At any sec school, he would be playing, not just practicing and sitting.
If Masina were to be charged, Helton would suspend him that minute. 
Do some homework next time
trigggguuurrrrred
she clearly said that although Saban’s punishments weren’t harsh enough, he at least handed out punishments that were heavier.
what kind of punishment is being suspended for the first half of the game against Utah?!
You said she “had no concerns” with Osa Masina going to class… YET SHE CLEARLY MAKES IT A POINT THAT IT’S STRANGE THAT HE IS STILL ALLOWED TO PRACTICE AND GO TO CLASS. You clearly didn’t read the article.
Helton should have suspended Ruffin indefinitely for that stomp. 
and why’d you say “honey”. weirdo.

Nick Entin | Daily TrojanToning it down · The football team drew attention for its entrance against Alabama prior to a 52-6 loss at AT&T Stadium to open the season.
When the football team comes out of the tunnel on Saturday against Utah State, its entrance will likely be subdued — at least compared to last week. 
USC’s shenanigans coming out of the tunnel prior to playing Alabama last Saturday was a topic of discussion during Wednesday’s practice at Howard Jones Field as the team continued preparations for its home opener against Utah State.
New Day, Different Controversy
Junior JuJu Smith-Schuster made headlines when he sparked an inter-squad scuffle during USC’s practice on Tuesday, but the wideout was back on the field with a more level head come Wednesday. Instead, the buzz shifted to the team’s unusual pre-game entrance onto the field at AT&T Stadium last weekend, when a few Trojan players drew attention to themselves with some dramatic posturing at the mouth of the tunnel.
Head coach Clay Helton said the staff was less than impressed by Saturday’s display and had addressed the issue with the squad.
“We had a couple kids who decided to let the pageantry mean more than the game,” he said. “It’s a learning lesson for us. Like I said, we’re not only building a team here but also a program and a culture.”
Sophomore linebacker Cameron Smith said he didn’t even see the entrance until he logged onto social media after the game, but he didn’t anticipate a repeat performance this weekend at the Coliseum.
“Some of the coaches said some stuff,” he said. “So I don’t know if that’ll be happening again.”
Aggie Adjustment
Returning to issues on the gridiron, the Trojans have spent the week digesting their mistakes against the Tide and preparing for their newest challenge against Utah State. It isn’t easy simultaneously gleaning lessons from a season opener against the defending national champions and getting ready for another game in three days, but the team is raring to go and rising to the challenge.
“No one’s feeling sorry for us, so we can’t feel sorry for ourselves,” Smith said. “We have to move on and play the next game.”
Junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson echoed his teammate’s comments and remained bullish on the rest of USC’s football season.
“We’re pretty hungry to get out there and play,” he said. “A lot of people think this is the end of the season for us, but we’ll come out stronger. One game doesn’t define you.”
Utah State will arrive in Los Angeles hunting for an upset over unranked USC, who dropped out of the AP Top 25 this week after starting the preseason at No. 20. Helton described his upcoming opponent as a “good coverage team,” and the Trojan defense has been preparing for the Aggies’ dual-threat quarterback, junior Kent Myers.
Of course, it was a fleet-of-foot signal caller who wreaked havoc against USC in Arlington last week, and Trojan defenders are keen to put their mistakes against Alabama quarterback Jalen Hurts behind them.
“They beat us on missed communications and missed assignments—you know, busted coverages and things like that,” safety Chris Hawkins said. 
Injury Update
Junior center Toa Lobendahn remained out of practice with a knee injury, and Helton said the team was awaiting the results of an MRI before proceeding any further. Redshirt junior defensive tackle Khaliel Rodgers was also sidelined with a hamstring issue. Sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett had his practice cut short with a shoulder sprain, and junior safety John Plattenburg continued to move through concussion protocol. Sophomore Noah Jefferson was still out with a shoulder injury.

Photo courtesy of Dan CameronPerfect canvas · Art curator Dan Cameron spoke at the USC Roski School of the Art and Design about the wide variety of exhibits he spearheaded. Many were inspired by Spanish and Latin American artists.
Esteemed art curator Dan Cameron visited the USC Roski School of the Art and Design Tuesday evening to speak about the myriad of different exhibits he planned over the years. Cameron, a native New Yorker, has worked at U.S. and international museums to create unique, versatile collections.
Cameron began by discussing how exhibits, unlike many other art forms, are ephemeral by comparing them to fruit. 
“The fruits of our labor, are well, like fruit,” Cameron said.
He said that it was important for him to make sure that his exhibits were as useful as possible. He strives to send a message and change the world with his collections. 
Cameron has stuck to that philosophy since the beginning of his career in 1982 with his first exhibit, “Extended Sensibilities,” which focused on gay and lesbian sensibilities in contemporary art. Though controversial, the exhibit helped Cameron establish a name in the art industry. 
“This was a time when no one wanted to talk about sexual identity,” Cameron said.
His next big project, “Art and Its Double,” was displayed in Madrid in 1986 at La Caixa. This was Cameron’s  first large international exhibit during a period when Spain was going through a political and cultural transition. As the dictatorship of Francisc Franco came to a close, the art in Spain changed from neo-expressionist and graffiti to a more conceptual, Art Pop style. Cameron brought the newest American art developments to Spain, and the exhibit was very popular for the year that it ran.
He was inspired by Spanish and Latin American artists after working with Felix Gonzalez-Torres, a renowned Cuban visual artist, in 1991. Cameron claimed that American art was “too limited” and that his time in Spain allowed him to view very different kinds of art that had not yet diffused to the United States. 
His time with Gonzales-Torres helped him foment ideas for his next exhibit “Cocido y Crudo” in Madrid in 1994. This exhibit featured the work of Jimmie Durham, an exiled Cherokee whose work, “Self Portrait”, was a reflection of the American treatment of Native Americans and Xu Bing’s “Book From the Sky,” a collection of books full of Mandarin-looking characters that were actually meaningless.
After spending nearly a decade in Spain, Cameron returned to the United States to the New Museum of Contemporary Art. He wanted to create a collection that no other large New York museum had done yet by bringing back the important artists from the sixties and seventies. This included Faith Ringgold, who combined painting and quilt making in her piece “Dancing at the Louvre,” and David Wojnarowicz’s “Fever,” a collection of pieces that protested the homophobia of the Catholic church. 
From 2002 to 2011, Cameron worked on several projects. In the United States, he was the senior curator for the New Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Internationally, he designed the political exhibit “Poetic Justice” in Istanbul in 2003 before the advent of the Iraq War.
His next major endeavor, Prospect 1, has been very impactful. During the Hurricane Katrina cleanup in New Orleans in 2007, Cameron wanted to start the cultural rebuilding of the city. He knew that trying to rebuild from what was once there would not be enough.
“You have to bring collections, you have to bring artists, you have to bring curators,” he said. 
He raised $4.5 million to use for the exhibit that has since then had a $25 million impact on the city. Though Cameron resigned from Prospect 1 in 2011, the project had a massive influence of the art culture of New Orleans.
Currently, Cameron is working on two exhibits in South America. The first XIII Biennial de Cuenca in Ecuador will open in late October. It features the theme of impermanence in art and includes pieces made of flimsy mediums such as cardboard and even an installation made from human hair. 
The second project, titled “The Surroundings,” will take place on the small Chilean island Chiloe. Cameron is hoping that this exhibit will help develop the infrastructure of this economically devastated area. 
This collection will open to the public in 2018. Cameron continues to ensure that his exhibits make a statement and has yet again shown how art can have an incredible impact on society.

Long limbs move gracefully through space, extending  and retracting like thick taffy. Tactful toes spread into the marley, pushing against the soft canvas slippers. Arms extend forward, bestowing the tender skin that screams, “Take me, I’m yours!”
This movement, feminine in form, presents the paradoxical nature of ballet. The women must be strong yet soft, controlled yet helpless, technical yet emotional. These antitheses, as previously discussed last week, have the ability to either create constant harmony, constant conflict or both. 
The lattermost outcome, to my understanding, is most in accordance with reality. While these antitheses create order by instituting guidelines to adhere by, leaning too far in one direction can destabilize one’s sense of being. This uncertainty causes female ballet dancers to question themselves, grappling with the fact that they’ll never achieve perfection — technically, emotionally and most destructively, physically. Before I was vegan, I had a terribly unhealthy relationship with food. Obsessively logging my calories in MyFitnessPal became a habitual practice my sophomore year of high school. 
Unfortunately, the female struggle to acquire and maintain a slim physique is not exclusive to the world of ballet. Every day, women are fed the ideal that equates thinness to beauty. Take, for example, Victoria’s Secret ads that feature lean models running around in their underwear, Brandy Melville’s “One Size Fits Most” clothing that really only fits sizes small and medium, or Ariana Grande, Kendall Jenner and every other thin celebrity or model that posts racy images of their bodies on social media platforms. Scarily enough, these examples don’t even address the entertainment industry that tend to glorify thin women. 
Luckily, there has been an increasing amount of opposition to the thin ideal. Meghan Trainor’s song, “All About That Bass,” celebrates curviness, Aerie’s #AerieREAL campaign challenges supermodel standards by featuring untouched photos of everyday women, and Dove’s Self Esteem Project strives to reduce girls’ anxiety over their appearances.
However, the obsession and glamorization of feminine thinness nevertheless prevails over reason. The push and pull of the antitheses and the constant pressure to be thin result in the need for control. This control manifests itself in the form of eating disorders. In fact, 20 million reported females suffer from eating disorders on a daily basis. 
When I wasn’t comfortable with my body, I excessively worked out every day of the week, in addition to my already demanding dance training. My family life was a mess and restricting what I ate served as my only source of control. If I went a day without logging my calories, I would look in the mirror and perceive myself as fat. After logging my calories, I suddenly looked skinny. This body dysmorphia I developed negatively affected my psyche. If I ate something I wasn’t supposed to — usually in private — I would break down in tears and shame myself for indulging. I went to bed hungry every night, feeling a sense of accomplishment at the rumbles coming from my empty stomach. 
Fortunately, I began to eat more my junior year, after I realized I was slowly killing myself. The 15 pounds I gained back that year still managed to upset me, even though I regained my healthy figure.
When I became a vegan during my senior year, my relationship with food unexpectedly changed. 
I began to eat food to fuel my body, counting the array of colors on my plate, instead of the calories. Instead of being judgmental of myself and others, I became more open-minded and generous, as I increased my sphere of compassion to the animals, which in turn infiltrated into the neglected private sphere (myself) and public sphere (friends, family, and strangers). In changing my mindset, I changed my lifestyle, and doing so helped me begin to redefine my definition of beauty. 
Beauty is not determined by the size of your clothing, the measurement of your hips, or the definition of your abs. All of those quantities and qualities are superficial and subjective, whereas strength of character and healthiness of the mind, body and spirit are beautiful in nature. After all, once you grow older, what are you going to look back on with pride? How taut and thin your body was or your life accomplishments? To empower yourself and others is truly a blessing. Let’s redefine beauty rather than succumb to the unattainable thin ideal.

Have you read The Vegan Studies Project?  There’s a lot of material in it about this very issue!  Thanks for sharing your experience.
I have not, thanks for the recommendation! I will check it out. :)

At the edge of East 9th Street in the heart of the L.A. Fashion District, the restaurant combines fresh ingredients and homemade recipes to curb lunchtime hunger.
Stepping into Kachi, it is clear that the restaurant is not made for a group of more than 10 people. The little space that they do have, however, is decorated and furnished in a way that visually expands the room. A major structure that aids the most in this expansion is the glass slab that allows customers to see the chef in action. This also allows validation that the food is made to order and as fresh as it comes. Along with this visibility is the ability for Kachi to also keep with the artsy atmosphere that surrounds them, with customer seating including solid metal chairs and wooden benches. The menu itself is written on a wooden board, hanging from the ceiling with thick rope, a testament to the minimalistic theme that the restaurant pushes.
Being a newly minted health fanatic, the advice of the man at the counter, was enlisted to sort through the many veggie combinations and house favorites. The Gaucho Bowl is the fan favorite of the restaurant, containing arugula, quinoa, cherry tomato, avocado and steak slices. If this bowl seems too heavy, the Super Food Salad is another favorite, boasting an all-star ingredient list with baby kale, chia and beets being a few of the components. If seafood is the craving, the Fish Taco Bowl combines cod with typical fish taco ingredients such as brown rice, corn and kidney beans. Even though the Super Food Salad was enticing, the Gaucho Bowl was the winner. To intensify the taste of South America, two empanadas were ordered as well.
The empanadas came out relatively fast after putting in the order, around four minutes later. They were served on a small, silver brushed platter and with chimichurri sauce on the side. The kale and spinach empanada was the first to be tasted and contained an ample amount of melted queso cheese as well as kale, spinach and onion. Diving into this dish first was a great way to get the show started. The crust was flaky and not greasy in the least. The melted queso was the glue that held the kale and spinach together within the empanada, while still not overpowering the empanada itself. There could have been, however, more kale within the filling since it seemed to be very sparse. Adding the chimichurri sauce did add a satisfying tanginess that was unexpected. Overall, it was a good empanada at an affordable price of $2.20.
The chicken empanada, however, was hands down the best dish out of the Gaucho Bowl and the spinach and kale empanada. Like Beyoncé at this year’s VMAs, it swept the competition with its incredible flavor, characterized by the beautiful blend of spices, chicken and onion filling within the lightweight golden crust. While  the chimichurri sauce was required to enhance the flavor of the kale and spinach, it was not needed in the case of the chicken. Though it did not harm the empanada, it did not enhance it either.
The Gaucho Bowl was the final dish served, presented itself in a simple plastic white bowl. The visual appeal of the dish was enhancedwith the avocado and steak strips lying atop the arugula in such a way that prompted an Instagram post. The excitement increased as the fork made contact with the bowl; It faltered once the first bite was taken. The bland beef was not hot or cold, which left the question of whether the semi-warm temperature was intentional. The chimichurri drizzled atop helped bring flavor into the otherwise flavorless meat. The crunchiness of the tomatoes and the texture of the quinoa combined with the smoothness of the avocado helped to keep the dish balanced, but the problem arose once the bowl was almost finished. The lemon vinaigrette became too sour and began to overpower the rest of the components of the bowl, leaving an uncomfortable sour sensation in the mouth. For $11.90 and the ability to get a cheaper bowl elsewhere, it is advisable to reconsider this menu choice.
In addition to the signature salads and bowls that range from $8-$12, Kachi offers burgers and sandwiches, as well as the option to build your own bowl. Even though the menu is on the shorter side, the portions of the dishes are more than filling, as well as having the benefit of the freshest ingredients around. With a location in the heart of downtown L.A., Kachi is putting its foot in the door as a Latin alternative to the eateries surrounding it. Though it still has some tweaking to do, it is headed in the right direction for success.

As Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump faced the national security test with his speech on Wednesday night, it brought up an important issue of what the next administration is going to do about ISIS. The United States’ current stance is with an understanding that, as President Barack Obama stated, “ISIS is not an existential threat.” However, popular consensus is pretty unanimous: It’s bad. No one predicted ISIS to be the effective and potent force it is now. Yet, Americans have been told that everything is okay and that ISIS poses no threat to us. But it’s hard to blame the Obama Administration entirely, because their take on these issues has been in accordance with the polls — popular sentiment calls for the U.S. not to involve itself in another Middle Eastern quagmire in the form of conflict with ISIS.
The current political climate has seen a revival in the populist mentality of American isolationism. Trump often throws around this kind of rhetoric mixed with the usual “maybe” or “I don’t know,” never really certain of what just exited his mouth. Regardless, the popular opinion to remain uninvolved is unacceptable. We shouldn’t lack concern. We can’t. Regardless of this nation’s war-fatigue or how many times a toupee-haired man disburses empty, passive-aggressive bellicosity, the United States absolutely has a responsibility to deal with the Islamic State as the leading nation of the world. Whoever wins the 2016 Election will inherit that responsibility — and both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton must recognize the immediate necessity to address this hindrance to world security and human rights. 
“Leading nation” does not mean to denote the claim “greatest nation in the world.” By pure, indisputable numbers the U.S. happens to have the world’s largest economy and military — and therefore, the largest influence. So whether we like it or not, having that kind of success means there are responsibilities that come with it. There’s a price you must pay when you’re the most powerful country on earth: Involvement everywhere. Wherever you go, you’ll be noticed and watched. Hence, the U.S. doesn’t have the luxury to sit by while the Levant goes up in flames.
VICE’s Ben Anderson makes it clear in his video report “Fighting ISIS” that Islamic State’s potency is forceful and effective despite the group’s disorganized coordination, which is why it is disturbing when Obama declared, “ISIS is not an existential threat to the United States,” in his interview with The Atlantic. Even his response to both ISIS-inspired shootings from last December in San Bernardino and this past June in Orlando have been to shift the attention of the issue on gun control, not the Islamic State. The President cannot ignore the fact that these shootings were as direct as ISIS could get to attacking the U.S. The very civil liberties and ways of life he fought to see protected by law — like gay marriage, et cetera — are being shot apart by a group that Obama insists does not pose a threat to the existence of the American people and their way of life.
We really have a dwarfed understanding of the kind of power that this ideologically-driven group possesses. If America does nothing more now, it will deal with an enemy that is becoming more battle hardened by the day. We will face an enemy mistakenly convinced that the world is silent from fear rather than strategic sequestration and encouraged to turn the once-fantastical intent of world domination into an unchallenged campaign. Yet ever increasingly, Americans are OK with an apathetic response to terror groups like ISIS. 
We weren’t always like this. Americans are known for their value of character. We’re known for the national persona of being stubborn, self-confident and sacrificial. The Korean War would never have happened if one man didn’t see further than what was fashionable. We must value our character above our comforts. As the people of the United States of America, our actions are seen by the world. In an age of globalization, everything is interconnected and if the only times our presidents reacted to war or atrocity was if it were popular then what a terrible example of a leader we are. When the president doesn’t react to genocidal activities in the Middle East because it isn’t popular, that says a lot about our character. It’s time we should change that to show ISIS, the world and ourselves why we fight.
Your article is like a breath of fresh air, good thoughts heading in to the election.  We need leadership not cronyism politics.

On Sept. 2, TIME Magazine tweeted, “Stanford swimmer Brock Turner to be released from jail Friday.” A few days later when Turner was registered as a sex offender, media outlets followed TIME’s precedent for a headline. BuzzFeed News tweeted, “Ex-Stanford swimmer Brock Turner registers as sex offender.” The Associated Press followed suit with a tweet reading “Ex-Stanford swimmer convicted of sexually assaulting unconscious woman registers as sex offender in Ohio.” However, it wasn’t just the headlines about Turner that were uniform; The responses to these headlines was rather uniform as well. Namely, there was one very common correction.
Some politely tweeted the various Twitter accounts questions like “Do you mean rapist?” Others went for more blatant snark with tweets like “It’s r-a-p-i-s-t not s-w-i-m-m-e-r ” and “I think you misspelled criminal.” But perhaps my favorite tweet came from Anup Kaphle: “Hey TIME, was he in jail for swimming?” 
This backlash against labeling Brock Turner a swimmer, however, is only the latest Twitter outrage related to the case. In fact, Turner’s narrative is inextricably linked to social media. The victim of his brutal sexual assault wrote a powerful letter that went viral. In fact, the letter gained so much attention on social media sites that it was eventually read aloud in the U.S. House of Representatives.      
When Turner was sentenced to a mere six months for his violent crime, a host of online petitions cropped up. The petitions ranged from asking for a longer sentence to demanding the removal of the judge who sentenced Turner, Judge Aaron Persky. So, when the news broke that Turner would serve only three months of his six-month sentence, it was hardly surprising that people quickly took to social media expressing outrage over Turner’s lenient treatment both by the media and by the criminal justice system. 
While Turner’s case is undoubtedly a glaring reminder of injustice, it is also a reminder of the difference many voices can make. Social media activism often gets a bad rap, and for good reason. The articles I share probably don’t make a difference most of the time and definitely shouldn’t be a substitute for organizing for change in real life. However, in the case of the #StanfordRapist, social media undoubtedly held people accountable when other systems failed. 
More than one million people signed a Change.org petition to remove Persky from the bench. At the end of August, CNN reported, “At his own request, the California judge facing a recall effort for his handling of a sexual assault case involving a Stanford student will no longer hear criminal cases.” There is an important debate about whether recalling Persky is an ethical move considering the judicial branch is meant to be independent from political pressure. However, it is clear that the recall movement is the result of the criminal justice system’s failure to adequately address sexual assault and its own endemic racism and classism. 
Furthermore, the viral attention Turner received resulted in legislative action in California. Just days before Turner’s early release, the California legislature passed a bill that closed loopholes in current sexual assault statutes and mandated harsher sentencing for perpetrators in cases like Turner’s. In an interview with The New York Times, Assemblyman Bill Dodd attributed the bill’s success to “the lax sentence in the Brock Turner case that drew international scorn.” Again, there is room for meaningful debate. Mandatory minimums and harsher sentencing may not solve the problem of rape on college campuses. However, the outrage on social media and the mobilization to remedy this injustice led to concrete efforts to fix a system that too often ignores sexual assault. 
Facebook shares, online petitions and retweets are not sufficient enough to end rape culture. They won’t prevent every judge from granting leniency to defendants based on their race or socioeconomic status. But last week, Twitter users proved they’re going to stay up-to-date with Turner’s story and, while doing so, demand accountability from legislatures, judges and journalists.

I always imagined studying in Scotland would be a step outside of my comfort zone, but I’ve been dropped on the other side of the Atlantic with my comfort nowhere in sight. 
There’s a powerful charm in the oldness here. In just the first week, I’ve walked past the birthplace of Arthur Conan Doyle, stumbled upon the residence of then-medical student Charles Darwin, and sipped on coffee in the same shop where J.K. Rowling penned Harry Potter. When wandering around the city, it’s impossible to miss the gigantic, looming 12th-century Edinburgh Castle that was once a strategic military fortress.
 
Sonali Seth | Daily Trojan
 
In everyday living, the history comes with a price. For a millennial like me, it’s a subtle shock to not have the 21st-century comforts that I’ve come to know so well. It means fumbling around with old locks and doors that don’t quite work anymore and walking five flights of stairs up to my flat because there is no elevator. It means that when I purchased my railcard, I watched someone print out my photo, cut it out, and paste it onto a physical card instead of uploading an electronic photo like one might see in the States.
Edinburgh isn’t totally stuck in the past, though. Cobblestone alleys and centuries old pubs line the Old Town, but just across the main bridge lies a humongous outdoor mall sprawling from the state-of-the-art rail system. The city is a majestic fusion of modernity and antiquity.

Centuries old or not, it’s all new to me now. When I wake up in the morning, I expect to be back home in a couple days, but then I’m struck with the surreal realization that this is my life now. 
There’s value in randomness – as an nineteen-year-old Indian American, what I saw as a whiskey-laden and sheep-filled country the size of South Carolina seemed like the last place I would find myself relating to. Maybe that’s one of the reasons I chose it; I never realized my complacency in normalcy until I found myself taking in new experiences with every breath.
Like a tourist, I’m enchanted with the novelty of it all, but I’m lucky enough to have the time to explore the nuances of a place that are so often overlooked by the rest of the world. In an attempt to redraw the mental caricature I have so far of Scotland, for the next five weeks, I will be studying Scottish history, culture and politics – entrenched in questions of Scottish national identity, regional policy problems and broader issues in political economy (yes, Brexit). Then, I’ll be spending the rest of my time working in public service to the Scottish people as a research aide in the Scottish Parliament.
I’m tremendously excited – excited at the new, but also excited for the new to become the old.
