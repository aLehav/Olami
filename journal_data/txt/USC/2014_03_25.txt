As spring break comes to an end, people enjoy being able to share stories of places they’ve traveled to and fun activities they did. The USC women’s water polo team will not find it hard to join the conversation as the No. 1 Women of Troy (18-0, 4-0) had a successful three-game road campaign that landed them in Honolulu last week.
The Women of Troy asserted their dominance over three powerhouse opponents in a brief two-day stint. In the first day of action, the squad posted a 15-5 victory over No. 14 Indiana. Despite a varied collection of offensive production led by freshman driver Stephania Haralabidis’ hat trick, it was the team’s stiff defense that propelled the conquest. In the rout, USC held the Hoosiers scoreless for more than 16 minutes spanning from the second quarter to the final period, helping them build an insurmountable lead.
Anchoring the terrific USC defense was reigning Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week and senior goalie Flora Bolonyai, who accounted for 12 saves in the triumph.
“She’s definitely someone you can count on. Hearing her voice in the cage directing and telling you what to do makes things a bit easier,” said senior driver Olivia Cummins. “Knowing that we have a great goalie as our final line of defense gives us great confidence as a defender.”
Saturday’s agenda was a bit more crowded, featuring a day-night double-header. Still, the Women of Troy remained poised and handled business as usual. In the day’s opening 12-3 throttling of No. 12 Long Beach State, three different Trojans recorded hat tricks capped off by junior two-meter Eike Daube’s fourth-quarter excellence.
After an intense meeting with the 49ers to begin the day, the Women of Troy did not let fatigue set in and wasted no time jumping on host Hawai’i. The Cardinal and Gold registered the first 10 goals of the contest before allowing the Rainbow Wahine to squeak one through just before halftime. Two different USC players tallied first-half hat tricks, including junior driver Monica Vavic’s second of the trip. After totaling six saves through the first three quarters, Bolonyai was relieved by sophomore goalie Alegra Hueso, who finished off a 14-6 victory for the Women of Troy.
“We put in a lot of work during the week so it was building off the momentum of things that we’ve learned, what we’ve been practicing, and applying it to the game,” said senior two-meter and captain Maddie Rosenthal. “After a really hard week of practicing, you want to prove that you can apply the new stuff that you’ve learned.”
Creating big leads has been a common occurrence in the early stages of the season for USC, opening the door for many underclassmen to gain invaluable in-game experience and display the depth of USC’s talent.
“I love being able to get a lead and have the young girls get in and show the coaches and us what they’ve been working for. Everyone is competing,” Cummins said. “We are on a team but everyone is competing for playing time. I love when everyone is able to get a chance to get in and show how hard they’ve been working.”
Vavic’s performance over the course of the tropical trip earned her a third career MPSF Player of the Week award, her first of the season. USC’s No. 8 all-time leading scorer registered nine total goals over the three-game span and is just five goals away from climbing another spot in USC’s record book.
The standout junior will be able to continue her pursuit tomorrow afternoon as the Hartwick Hawks (15-8) make the trip to challenge the unbeaten Women of Troy at home in the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
Though they have just returned from a lengthy road trip facing three top-tier opponents, the Women of Troy are focused and ready to do what it takes to continue their success in the pool.
“We start preparing at the beginning of the season for every team,” Cummins said. “We are definitely going to study their players, know their best shooters, their drivers, two-meters, defenders and take it like every other game.”
The Women of Troy are not the only hot team entering the contest and need to account for a hot Hartwick squad. The Hawks enter the game having won six of their past seven games, including an impressive 15-12 road victory over No. 8 Loyola Marymount.
Cummins and the Women of Troy put their unblemished record on the line with game time slated for 5:00 p.m on Thursday.

The No. 1 USC women’s golf team rode a 7-under par performance yesterday during the second round of the SDSU Farms Invitational to overtake co-host San Diego State and tie fellow Pac-12 competitor Arizona State for third place. With just 18 holes left to play tomorrow at the Farms C.C. in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., the USC women’s golf team hopes to overtake crosstown rival No. 2 UCLA for the championship trophy. The Bruins lead the Women of Troy by eight strokes.

Sophomore Annie Park and freshman Karen Chung provided the Women of Troy with two solid rounds of 68 yesterday, the only pair of teammates in the tournament to produce scores in the 60s during the second round of play. Sophia Popov arguably proved to be the difference maker for USC, posting a 2-under 70 yesterday, improving on her 10-over par round on Monday.
After 36 holes, the Women of Troy have their work cut out for them, trailing the first place UCLA Bruins and the second place Stanford Cardinal. The Bruins remain the only team with under par performances for both the first and second rounds, led by freshman Alison Lee, who strung together scores of 68 and 73.
Both No. 9 Stanford and No. 4 Arizona State performed well enough yesterday to strengthen their chances at catching UCLA. The Cardinal remain the only team with three competitors under par in the tournament, with freshman Casey Danielson and sophomore Lauren Kim impressively finishing both rounds at 4-under par.
Individual leader Emma Henrikson of unranked San Diego State posted consistent scores of 68 and 69 during the first two rounds to sit at 7-under par. Her fellow Aztecs failed to contribute to their team effort with no other player under par; they trail the first place Bruins by 13 strokes. USC’s Karen Chung leads the Women of Troy at 2-under on the tournament, placing her in a tie for fifth on the individual leaderboard.
After winning the Bruin Wave Invitational on March 4, the Women of Troy hope to continue their momentum with another victory tomorrow. Annie Park recorded her record setting ninth round in the 60s for the Women of Troy at the Bruin Invitational and extended that record to 10 rounds after posting a stellar 4-under 68 Tuesday.
This promising second round by the USC women’s golf team will hopefully give the team the push they need to win their second straight tournament this month. For the top ranked Women of Troy, this third round could not provide a better stage to showcase their chemistry as a team, as well as their individual skill as golfers.

The cloudy gloom over Marks Stadium couldn’t cast a shadow over the USC men’s tennis team’s fiery playing style in yesterday’s matchup against No. 75 San Diego State. The newly minted No. 1 Trojans dominated with a 7-0 sweep — their ninth straight victory.
Vroom vroom · Sophomore Max de Vroome battled back to win his singles match against San Diego State’s Hunter Nicholas by a score of 6-4, 5-7, 1-0 (10-2). No. 100 de Vroome also picked up a doubles win. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Sophomore Max de Vroome and junior Eric Johnson scored a quick 8-2 win over the Aztecs’ Andranik Khachatryan and Hunter Nicholas, setting the tone in doubles action. Though the win was expected, what wasn’t expected was head coach Peter Smith’s unconventional coaching style going into this matchup.
“I wanted to make it as tough on us as possible,” Smith said, referring to his unconventional lineup. “I wanted to play as many guys as I could, and make it tough.”
Smith’s team was up for the task, and handled themselves well. Freshman Nick Crystal played with previous Pac-12 player of the week Roberto Quiroz, who beat out their teammates on court three and secured an 8-5 win over Freddy Gelbrich and Hendrik Jebens.
“Nick [Crystal] played great,” Smith said. “I think that would be our third team.”
Smith’s unexpected lineup achieved exactly what he wanted: a chance for underutilized players to win.
In singles, freshman Rob Bellamy drummed up a quick 6-1, 6-1 win over Khachatryan for a lift to a 2-0 lead for USC — and for the freshman’s seventh straight victory. Next, Michael Grant took down SDSU’s Milen Ianakiev in a 6-0, 6-2 to make it 3-0. Sealing the Trojans’ team win was No. 56 junior Roberto Quiroz. Quiroz claimed his eighth victory in a row over Thorsten Bertsch in a 4-0 lead.
Next in line with a straight-set win for USC was Eric Johnson, whose 6-1, 7-5 win over Freddy Gelbrich at court three extended his lead to 5-0. At the No. 5 spot, Jonny Wang rang up a 6-2, 6-3 win, coming back in his second set to beat Juan Florez and boost USC to the 6-0 advantage.
“I fought my heart out, tried my hardest, and stayed positive,” Wang said.
USC achieved straight-set wins in every singles match but one — No. 2. Despite a slow start, Max de Vroome clinched a win in the second set by pummeling his opponent Nicholas in a tiebreaker. De Vroome finished his match and the game with an action-packed 6-4, 5-7, 1-0 (10-2) win.
Though the Trojans are no strangers to being No. 1, this marks the first time the Trojans have held the position since the close of the 2012 season, when USC finished off its fourth consecutive national championship run.
Coach Smith credited his team’s success to its competitive nature.
“If you look at the scores,” Smith said. “There was a lot of 5-0, 7-0. It wasn’t about easing [the team’s] way into it, it was about ramming [the team’s] way onto the court.”
USC’s coming road trip will take the Trojans to the Pacific Northwest. The Trojans battle  Oregon in a 1:30 match on Friday before traveling to Washington at 1 p.m. on Saturday.

I was having my coffee this morning when I saw a really rude Facebook status update. A friend of mine, a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan, was relieved that wide receiver Desean Jackson was talking to Chip Kelly and looking to stay with the Eagles. “Especially,” he wrote, “after hearing that we’re gonna sign Mark ‘Butt Fumble’ Sanchez. Isn’t it bad enough that we already have one crappy Trojan QB on our team?” He was, of course, referring to former USC quarterback and current Philadelphia Eagles backup Matt Barkley.
It was rude, but my friend had a point. The Trojans have not been known for producing the most enthralling quarterbacks in the professional ranks. Matt Leinart, a former Heisman Trophy winner, is currently not on any professional roster. Former USC quarterback Matt Barkley has been less-than-thrilling in his three appearances for the Eagles, somehow managing to amass four interceptions with zero touchdowns.
And then there was the “Sanchise.” The former New York Jets quarterback left USC early against the wishes of former head coach Pete Carroll. He impressed the Jets enough to the point that they traded three players and their first and second-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft to take him as the fifth selection overall. Sanchez’s tenure with the Jets thereafter was mired in inconsistencies. When he wasn’t getting caught eating hot dogs on the sideline during the game, Sanchez was being made the scapegoat for a constantly underperforming Jets offense.
Aside from Carson Palmer (two appearances) and Matt Cassel (one), no Trojan quarterback has made the Pro Bowl. No USC quarterback has ever played in the Super Bowl, either. Yet the Trojans continue to recruit some of the top talent in the nation at the position. Leinart was the No. 1 quarterback in the nation coming out of high school. Current Trojans quarterback Cody Kessler was a four-star recruit, and redshirt freshman Max Browne was the No. 1 pro-style quarterback in his class.
So why do Trojan quarterbacks falter in the pros? The Trojans have every single tool at their disposal to have quarterbacks succeed at the professional level. On top of the world-class talent surrounding them, the team runs a pro-style offense and has one of the largest fan bases in college football. If anything was to prepare a college player for the pros, it’s the near-pro experience of being a quarterback at USC.
USC operates like a microcosm for the professional quarterback experience. But when high school players make the transition from their local and state-level games to the college level, the first aspect of the game that changes is speed. Decision-making is distilled to a five-second blur of jerseys and defenders. The high school game is far more forgiving, and quarterbacks who are able to adjust to adversity without bumps in the road are rare. In theory, creating an environment that allows players to play in a comfortable system eases the transition from high school to college.
This approach is counter-intuitive to a quarterback’s development in one key area: the ability to adjust to adversity. The change in speed between the college game and the professional game is dramatic. The change in pressure is astronomic. Quarterbacks go from representing a single school to entire cities and, in some cases, national fan bases (for example, the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys).
The USC school of quarterback development fails to account for this single crucial factor of a signal caller’s development. Another school that employs a pro-style offense with a massive fan base is the University of Alabama, and the Crimson Tide have yet to produce a noteworthy quarterback from their system. So it’s not necessarily the school specifically, but the system of offense that sets up its quarterbacks for unreasonable expectations at the professional level.
Sanchez struggled to adjust to the NFL for myriad reasons, including the fact that the New York media routinely lambasted him for underperforming. But Sanchez only started at USC for one season and dove headlong into the draft process, setting himself up for the unreal pressure of playing for a professional team without a true idea of what that entailed.
Sanchez’s career at USC was not without controversy. He spent a night in jail on a sexual assault charge that was eventually dropped. The pressure of playing at USC had taken its toll before he had taken his first snap as the starter for the Trojans. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the former Mission Viejo High School star is done in the NFL. Sanchez has had time to learn the speed of the game at the professional level. It’s not entirely unfeasible that he comes back to have a solid pro career.
But the adjustment from the college to the pros is perhaps the most trying transition in an athlete’s life. Sanchez’s rise from USC star to a starting spot for the notoriously unforgiving market in New York City was as meteoric as it was eerily seamless. There was no room for adversity along the way, no festering in a little-known or mid-level program, no chip on his shoulder and no time to pick up the psychological challenges that came with the professional-level learning curve.
How Matt Barkley and Mark Sanchez progress in the overall NFL landscape remains to be seen. Eagles head coach Chip Kelly has the type of up-tempo offensive system that can make or break a quarterback’s career. But the Trojans who enjoyed the convenience of having superior skill players for the majority of their college careers will have to learn how to adjust to the speed of the professional game — quickly.

Wait didn’t Mark Sanchez take the Jets to the NFC Championship two years in a row?? I think what we’re looking at there is a failure to play in NYC. 
As for Barkley… I don’t think he ever knew what adversity meant. Look at this guy– prepped from the start to be the QB for USC. He never had to play in a big game, either– he never won a bowl game while he was here. I remember seeing it in the UCLA game two years ago: when the pressure was in his face, he never could avoid it. 
At the NFL level, you have to be an athlete, but you also have to have the composure. The problem with this article is that it takes a ham-fisted approach with 1) a short memory about events that happened only three or four years ago, and 2) the QBs’ “adversity.” The problem is, I don’t think USC QBs ever have to know what pressure is like. They’re mini-celebrities who are under no impetus to make new solutions to problems, such as defensive pressure. At the college level, they can rely on talent alone; but, to make an effective transition to the NFL, they have to be smart, creative, and have those intangibles we’ve all seen in one form or another. #TimeForBaseballSeason
SC needs to stop looking at southern California, or CA high schools in general, for QBs. Texas produces great QBs. Look at Andrew Luck, formerly of Stanford. He’s from Texas. Texas is a football-producing state, high school wise. 
Look in Texas if you want great QBs…because that other team across town supposedly recruited a highly touted QB.

The USC women’s basketball team’s season came to an abrupt end last Saturday, when St. John’s handed the No. 24 Women of Troy a first-round NCAA tournament loss. Still, the team exceeded expectations in its first year under head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, a season that was highlighted by a remarkable upset of Stanford in the Pac-12 tournament.

Though the team’s success was somewhat unexpected, it adds to a long tradition of success for USC women’s basketball. From 1991-1994, the program made four consecutive trips to the NCAA tournament. Much of this success was driven by women’s basketball legend and pioneer Lisa Leslie, who was selected to four All-Pac-10 teams and set numerous conference records in her time at USC. Later, Leslie would go on to make eight WNBA all-star teams and be named MVP of the league three times. The Gardena, Calif. native also won four gold medals in four Olympic appearances. Today, Leslie is heavily involved in the Capital One Cup, annually awarded to best men’s and women’s collegiate athletics programs in the country. Daily Trojan Sports Editor Aubrey Kragen sat down with Leslie last weekend.
 
DT: Can you explain what the Capital One Cup is and your involvement with it?
Leslie: I’m on the advisory board for the Capital One Cup and I enjoy following all the sports throughout the college sports season, but of course basketball is my favorite and every sport has bragging rights — every sport. And whether it’s soccer or basketball, the Capital One Cup really represents the ultimate bragging rights in college sports. I’m really pulling for USC. We’re ranked No. 14 right now on the women’s side, which is great. But we’ve got to win some more national championships, of course. I’m always biased when I’m talking about the Capital One Cup because I always have to throw in USC. Actually, our men are ranked No. 18, so we’re not doing terrible, but we could definitely move up in the rankings and earn more points. The winner can earn 60 points if you win a national championship for the school, so right now Penn State’s women are No. 1, and UCLA is actually No. 2, so I’m not too happy about that. And then on the men’s side, Florida State leads the way. The winner for the men’s and women’s athletic program wins the Capital One Cup trophy, which we will present at the ESPYs. And they also get a combined $400,000 in athlete scholarships at the end of the spring athletic season.
 
DT: Do you think senior forward Cassie Harberts has what it takes to succeed in the WNBA?
Leslie: I’ve seen her improve every year, year in and year out. I really love the new move she’s added with that turnaround fadeaway jumper that she’s been able to make consistently, so I think Cassie has really improved every year. That’s what you want to see, especially in your senior year. It’s great that she’s been able to lead her team to the title, with Coach [Cooper-Dyke] as well. So I’m really excited about her possibilities at the next level.
 
DT: In general, what do you think it takes to be successful in the professional leagues?
Leslie: Well, the first thing I would suggest for Cassie is to get a personal trainer because it’s a very physical league and that’s probably the biggest transition I would say that I remember coming from the WNBA when it began — how physical it was on my body. It’s very taxing, so you need to get in the weight room, make sure that you’re physically fit from a standpoint of stamina. Because she’s not gonna come in and be a starter, but if you’re talking about being the 10th or 11th player on a team, you have to be physically fit and ready to come in. I think she should start from there, and then you never know. You get into the try-outs, and you’ve got to give it your all. Like I said, I like her jump shot. I would say she has to focus more on rebounding, because rebounding offensively is really key and just focusing on a lot of the small things and figuring out what she can bring and add to a team.
 
DT: Why is it important for women to participate in sports and for that to be rewarded?
Leslie: Statistics show that girls who play sports are more likely not to do drugs, more likely not to get pregnant early, they’re more likely to go to college, they’re more likely to finish college. They’re more likely to excel in the business world. There are so many positive things surrounding what happens when you participate in sports and any extracurricular activities. I found that basketball, for me, has really helped me be the person that I am. I’m able to deal with just life situations, good or bad. Things that are tough, it’s been tough in a game before. Things get hard, we always say you learn more about people during hard times. In good times, it’s easy. So I’m a huge promoter of girls and women in sports just because you’re more likely to be able to succeed when you’re done with your basketball career.

The USC football team returned to Howard Jones Field on Tuesday after a 10-day hiatus, as it entered its second full week of spring practice under new head coach Steve Sarkisian.

Sarkisian applauded the team for its ability to stay in shape following the team’s spring break.
“From a physical standpoint, our conditioning was pretty good and that just shows their willingness to working during spring break to keep up with the pace of practice,” Sarkisian said.
On the practice field, the team continues to adapt to Sarkisian’s much faster playing style and new system in general, while a lot of players continue to compete with their teammates in key position battles.
Quarterback Duel 
Coming into the spring, everyone knew that the most intriguing position battle would come at quarterback. Sarkisian  could elect to go with incumbent redshirt junior Cody Kessler or up-and-coming redshirt freshman Max Browne, both of whom are still learning to adapt to Sarkisian’s newly installed no-huddle offense.
“Each and every day and every rep, it comes more smoothly and you get more comfortable every time you get out there in the team setting,” Browne said.
Browne claimed that he benefited from the break, using it to watch film and see what he has to work on with his mechanics.
Kessler agreed, saying that as the offense continues to play with each other and gets used to the system, the tempo of play will come along with it.
“Once you start getting into the rhythm of things and running the same plays, guys are going to be flying around,” Kessler said.
Sarkisian seemed to be happy with the performance of all quarterbacks in just the team’s fourth practice this spring.
“The quarterbacks made much quicker decisions today,” Sarkisian said.
The  offensive line also appears to getting more comfortable on the field, especially center Max Tuerk, who looks like he is starting to snap the ball better.
Gettting feisty
There was a lot of extracurricular activity after the whistle in the 7-on-7 set on Tuesday.
It also got chippy at times, particularly when redshirt junior wide receiver Victor Blackwell and junior cornerback Kevon Seymour got into a little quarrel towards the end of practice.
Sarkisian liked the feistiness to an extent as it showed that the team has aggressiveness, but he does not appreciate it with respect to the pace of play.
“If guys feel like they have time to yap at the guy across from them, we’re not snapping the ball fast enough,” Sarkisian said.
He did praise the defense, however, for their improved communication and also said he thought they showed a great ability to impact and strip the football.
Quick Takes
 Tailback Javorius ‘Buck’ Allen is getting looks in the wheel route and on one instance caught a long touchdown pass from Kessler.
Freshman offensive lineman Toa Lobendahn took a lot of reps with the first team at the guard position.
USC commits Damien Mama and Adoree’ Jackson were present at practice on Tuesday, while 2015 verbal commit Ricky Town was also in attendance.

The Marshall School of Business announced Tuesday that it will launch a new Master of Science in Entrepreneurship and Innovation degree through its highly ranked Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurship Studies.
James G. Ellis, dean of Marshall, said the new program will address the increased desire for professionals with entrepreneurial backgrounds.
“There is a growing demand among students with technical backgrounds for a consolidated, MBA-type degree that has a real focus on young enterprises,” Ellis said in a press release. “With the Master of Science in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, the Greif Center is meeting this need — equipping technically proficient students with critical business skills for long-term career success.”
The experimental program, which can be completed in as little as 12 months, will welcome its inaugural class in fall 2014. There will be approximately 25 students accepted into the program from a four-year baccalaureate program along with working professionals and those with advanced degrees.
Both full-time and part-time programs will be offered, with classes beginning during a brief pre-fall semester. The part-time program can be completed in two years, with many classes being offered at night to accommodate the needs of working professionals. All 26 units needed to complete the degree will be taught at the University Park Campus.
The new program continues the trend at Marshall of introducing new curriculum focused on entrepreneurship to prospective students. Earlier this year, Marshall introduced a master’s focused on social entrepreneurship through the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab.
Andrea Belz, academic director of the new MSEI program and a professor at Marshall, elaborated on the potential of the newly formed program.
“It is a focused curriculum for people interested in launching new ventures, whether it’s an existing company or a startup,” Belz said.
The program will culminate with a capstone course, taught by Belz, called Venture Initiation, that focuses on how to get a business off the ground and turn a concept into reality.
Belz also discussed certain challenges the program seeks to address for its startup-minded students.
“Entrepreneurs get asked a lot of hard questions, in particular during the fundraising phase, such as, ‘What is your Plan B or Plan C, also questions about sales projections, payroll and information technology, to name a few,” Belz said.
She noted how investors in the L.A. area will come and speak with students on the best way to address these challenges.
“We bring in a number of experts from the Los Angeles fundraising market to discuss these issues with students, the best ways to address them and other tips for pitch meetings,” Belz said. “Students can learn what venture capital and other investors look for in potential investments directly from the source. This allows students to answer these questions in the classroom prior to a live pitch meeting and provides a strong foundation for our students     post-graduation.”

President C. L. Max Nikias announced this month that USC will be providing scholarships for high school students whose parents have served or are currently serving in the military.
The scholarship will allow children of military families to attend a summer session at USC. The announcement was made on March 13 at a conference in D.C.
Mark Todd, associate provost of Academic Affairs who oversees the Office of Continuing Education and Summer Programs, explained that the scholarship will offer classes over a wide variety of subjects.
“With the scholarship, the children will be able to take one of the 21 classes offered by Summer@USC program, a program directed towards high school students,” Todd said. “Students that win the scholarship will then be able to take a class in a subject like architecture, engineering, pre-law, business, global studies, journalism, writing, critical thinking or the performing arts.”
Todd noted that in order to be eligible, students must be the son or daughter of a current or former U.S. military service member and be in either 10th, 11th or 12th grade.
USC will cover the costs of tuition, flights, room, board and lab costs for scholarship winners who will have the opportunity to see what their freshmen year might be like. The announcement was made at a conference in D.C. on March 14, where President Nikias and other university administrators met with key legislators.
The initiative is a continuation of a relationship USC has maintained with the military beginning in 1914. Since 1940, the university has partnered with ROTC and has offered two master’s degrees related to the military: a master’s in social work with a concentration in military service and a master of business for veterans.
The School of Social Work has also created the Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families, where researchers study topics such as how different educational settings affect the children of military servicemen. It also helps integrate military families into civilian life.
Todd said the university has been hoping to provide scholarships to military families for quite some time.
“President Nikias has always wanted to provide assistance to active military, veterans, their spouses and families. Therefore, in order to help, Provost Elizabeth Garrett created this scholarship,” Todd said.
Many people are pleased with the scholarship as it can relieve families from financial stress as well as help them to better adjust to civilian life.
Tyler Driskill, a USC alumnus and the son of a U.S. Air Force Commandant, spoke about the financial difficulties many enlisted officers face.
“They have a huge financial burden with life in general,” Driskill said. “Many of them have a family member that works day and night to pay off debts. They are extraordinary individuals, and to have scholarships for their children, it would help them out significantly.”
Brian Lim, a sophomore in USC ROTC, also discussed the sacrifices military families make.
“In the case of military children, they leave their friends, schools and homes every few years when they have to move to a new duty station,” Lim said. “This scholarship provides these children with an opportunity they would otherwise not have.”
Arie Bogard, a sophomore at George Mason University and the son of a Foreign Officer in the Army, said the scholarship creates one less thing for military families to worry about.
“This scholarship also provides families that are overseas with comfort knowing that their children are safe and that they don’t have to budget in order to pay for expensive housing,” Bogard said.
Mireille Olivo, a sophomore at American University and the daughter of an Officer Colonel, noted this summer opportunity could motivate students to attend university.
“Allowing children to attend amazing institutions like USC would give them the motivation and skills to get into great college,” Olivo said. “They often miss out on their parents’ guidance while applying to universities since they are away.”
Ron Avi Astor, a professor in the School of Social Work and the Rossier School of Education, hopes that in the future USC will extend its efforts beyond children in their K-12 years and lead the effort in its inclusion of military families at the university level.
“Our partnerships in elementary, middle and high schools already work on helping military families provide the support veterans and their families need when they adjust to civilian life,” Astor said. “Perhaps other universities will emulate this USC initiative so that they can help children of the warriors that serve our country.”
Astor also mentioned that the announced summer scholarship will be the perfect environment for military children.
“What USC is doing is great since the friendly military environment it fosters will make these high school students feel welcomed,” Astor said. “USC is a place that is warm and welcoming. These talented and experienced students from military families with great leadership skills need places where they belong, and in my opinion USC will be the best place.”

Last night’s USG meeting featured presentations from incoming Chief of Staff Hassaan Ebrahim and President Elect Andrew Menard, as well as a presentation on behalf of USG’s latest program board organization, the Environmental Student Assembly.
Menard announced the appointment of new executive officers to assist in the direction of USG.
“It was extremely competitive this year; we had a ton of outstanding applications. I’m totally confident in their ability,” said Menard.
These new executives are resolved to help Menard in his plan to improve the efficiency of USG and its member organizations.
“We really want to push the internal efficiency of USG,” Ebrahim said.
To this effect, Ebrahim and Menard proposed a variety of amendments to USG’s bylaws. These various amendments deal with reducing the working hours of USG positions, such as Parliamentarian, and restructuring USG organizations for greater efficiency within  student government.
The Senate will discuss and vote on the proposed amendments next week.
Vice President Ryan Park gave a presentation on behalf of the Environmental Student Assembly, the newest organization to join USG’s Program Board.
ESA was established in the spring of 2013 to promote sustainability and environmental awareness on campus.
“We found there was a huge need among students for environmentally friendly practices that wasn’t necessarily being met,” Park said.
Since then, ESA has become a permanent member of USG’s Program Board and has grown in terms of its membership and outreach.
“They’ve built attendance and gotten students out for their events. They also have nine new member organizations,” Park said.
The nine member organizations within ESA have diverse emphases, but are united by a common concern for environmental sustainability.
Park believes that ESA’s upcoming Earth Month will illustrate the organization’s growth and success.
“Even with the limited budget they have, they have an awesome program lined up,” Park said.

Sir Ken Robinson spoke Tuesday night to a crowd of USC students, faculty and their guests about how the modern educational system neglects students’ natural talents and creativity in the Ronald Tutor Center Grand Ballroom.
Imagine · Sir Ken Robinson is well-known for having the most-watched TED talk in history, in which he urges his audience members to imagine an education system that encourages creativity instead of limiting it. – Matt Zheng | Daily Trojan
“Creativity is a conversation and it’s a very unexpected one,” he said.
Sir Ken Robinson is known for giving the most-watched TED talk of all time on how schools kill creativity, with more than 20 million views from the TED website. He is also the author of numerous books, including The New York Times 2009 bestseller The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything.
The event was hosted by  Academic Culture Assembly of USC Program Board in celebration of EdMonth.
USC Program Board started EdMonth at USC two years ago as the first national student-led movement and discussion about the state of education in our country.
During his lecture, Robinson argued that there are three principles that drive mass education: academic ability, compliance and the false belief that life is linear. These principles, he said, do not foster people’s individual talents.
“I have always believed that human beings have deep natural talents,” Robinson said. “But that most people don’t discover them … The consequence of that is that they never develop those talents.”
Robinson used examples from his life as well as current cultural and technological inventions such as the iPhone and Google Glass to underscore how important creativity is. He also emphasized that creativity and the ability to use imagination is what sets human beings apart from other living organisms.
“Creativity is at the heart of human culture,” he said. “You might call it applied imagination.”
He also discussed how educational systems in Asian countries award students with academic ability, but said that these are areas with the highest amounts of depression among students. He argued for educational reform and said that creative acts and “doing something” should be at the heart of educational systems, rather than academic ability.
“Our education system is obsessed with a certain type of academic conformity,“ he said. “But if all we had is academic ability, most of human culture wouldn’t have happened, would it?”
A revolution, he said, is happening in the world because of technology and demographics. Because of this, he continued, the educational system needs to be rethought with an emphasis on creativity.
A further concern he addressed was how the educational system is currently failing students. He mentioned that 13 percent of students who start the ninth grade do not make it to graduation.
“Sounds like they failed the system,” he said. “[It is] much more probable that the system failed them.”

Ever feel like the world is crashing down on you? That is how I feel about being back at school after what should have felt like a fairly long spring break. But not to worry, Trojans, summer is only six weeks away, and then your freedom begins.
Spring break was awesome: I went to the beach and even got some color — albeit at the cost of a sunburn and the lovely threat of skin cancer. Though Los Angeles might not be its usual sunny self at the moment, the arrival of consistent sun and heat is just around the corner — so preparation for protection is in order.
I am a fan of multipurpose items: cleaning supplies, furniture, articles of clothing and, most importantly, food. Multipurpose items help college kids save money and time, of which we have little. There is a scene in Disney’s The Princess Diaries where Mia Thermopolis gets a makeover — her nails are done, her hair is cut and shaped, her eyebrows are tweezed and cucumber is placed on her eyes. Her stylist, the funny and very Italian Paolo, eats one of the cucumbers during Mia’s spa treatment while telling his assistants that there is no point to the vegetable and that it is just something that people made up for the sake of relaxation. Cucumbers, however, are actually a very versatile vegetable. They are wonderful for beautification and also for a healthy snack. So, sorry Paolo, they do have a purpose.
Ever heard of avocado facials? Exactly. Long story short, food is not only food in your stomach, but also on your face and for your face. Here are three useful ways that I protect my skin and satisfy the munchies, brought to you with the helpful advice of Fitness Magazine.
I never used to be a yogurt person — ask my mother, I was a complete struggle when it came to eating breakfast — but with time, I learned to love it and now I eat yogurt with granola, honey and sliced banana every morning. Not only is yogurt healthy, providing a good 10 grams of protein to your diet, but the lactose-laden dairy product also prevents wrinkles — talk about multitasking.
Picture this: It is a lazy Sunday morning and you just got out of your long, refreshing shower and you look for some healthy breakfast grub. Then, you realize that you are out of lotion, so you put your breakfast on your face. OK, kidding, I do not recommend doing that — it will not serve a purpose and will make you look silly — but feel free to take a selfie and send it my way if you do. Regardless, the protein in yogurt helps firm skin and ultimately makes your complexion smoother. One serving a day will keep your face not astray. To my lactose intolerant friends, do not fret — a lack of yogurt in your diet will not prevent you from having clear skin.
Next week it will be April and the sun will be out and shining — we are pretending that April showers do not exist in California, but if they do, this next drinkable item is sure to cure the heat and humidity’s effect on your face as well as warm your heart. Green tea is full of antioxidants, and several studies have proven that it helps fight inflammation. Think of it this way: If the weather stresses you out, you can cuddle up with some warm tea that makes you look great. Now that is multitasking.
I have a small obsession with bell peppers. They are great and extremely versatile. Bell peppers are good in salads, sautéed, fried, baked and even as desserts — when I am trying to limit my dessert intake, I just eat a bell pepper because the red and orange ones are so sweet. Not only are bell peppers tasty, but they are also beneficial in preventing crow’s feet — that is, the squinty part of your eye that wrinkles up when exposed to the sun. In California, that potential is very real. Just think of the number of times you go to the beach — sure, sunglasses serve a purpose, but wouldn’t you rather munch on something refreshing at the beach and maintain your movie star good looks? I know I would.

Eating eco-friendly doesn’t have to be a good homecooked meal bought from the local farmers market. This is the idea behind Justice Urban Tavern, the new American restaurant on the border between Little Tokyo and Civic Center boasting a menu using locally sourced ingredients.

The menu itself is pretty standard fare, featuring typical burger, pasta and various types of grilled meats ranging from steak to barbeque ribs. In all honesty, not much stands out. You pick your dish, and choose from one of five sides to complement it. The appetizers are a little more eclectic, but nevertheless feature pretty standard fare.
One of the better dishes is their Angel City IPA Battered Pacific Cod, which is battered using beer from Angel City brewery, less than a 15 minute walk away in the Arts district.
The most striking feature of Justice Urban Tavern is the tasteful design of the space. The indoor space has high ceilings and is well lit by a combination of skylights and warm lights, leading to a brightly sunlit area during the day and a warmer, cozier lighting at night.
The interior décor is a mix of rustic and modern, featuring countryside–inspired touches such as wooden floorboards and slate columns. The furniture itself is widely spaced, and organized in such a manner that the restaurant itself manages to feel spacious yet intimate. This even carries over into the utensils and plating, with the water glasses being served in a glass the color of a wine bottle, and a water pitcher that resembles a large bottle.
The outside is much more modern, featuring a large outdoor patio with tables and chairs. Some chairs are your typical outdoor patio chairs while others are large rocks whose tops have been cut flat and polished, with cushions  placed on top to form large, and very unusual benches.
The food itself is hit or miss, however. Their specialty is “The Barrister Burger” a burger on a brioche bun with American cheese, butter lettuce, roasted tomatoes and house pickles. The side that immediately comes to mind to accompany this dish are the hand-cut fries with spiced ketchup. The burger itself is a lesson in elegant execution, with its simple ingredients forming a whole greater than the sum of its parts. I ordered it medium rare, and it came out grilled to perfection. Very slightly charred on the outside, with a juicy and savory inside, the patty comes across as simple and beautifully done.
The burger itself draws immediate comparisons with In-N-Out. Both are simple, and do not contain exotic ingredients that other restaurants, such as Chego and Umami Burger, add into their burger. The Barrister burger however, is significantly more expensive at $12. That extra cost nets you a significantly thicker grilled patty, as well as quality ingredients and several sides. The fries themselves are mediocre. They are well fried on the outside, but are very mushy on the inside and overall just average. The house pickles have a spicy kick to them, while the roasted tomato comes across as clean and flavorful. Combined, they are the perfect palate cleanser.
The “Roasted Spring Veggie Paperdelle Pasta” however, did not fare as well. Served with spring vegetables such as carrots, asparagus and broccoli, as well as pan seared tomatoes and shaved dry jack cheese, the pasta was dull at best. One would imagine that ingredients with such strong taste such as asparagus and tomatoes would come across as incredibly flavorful and pleasant to eat. In reality, the dish is fairly tasteless. The tomatoes were undetectable, if present at all, and the carrots and broccoli were nearly devoid of taste. Even the asparagus was largely flavorless. Though the pasta noodles themselves were decent, cooked just to al dente, they were largely unremarkable and the dish as a whole overwhelmingly tasted mildly of cheese and a light creamy mushroom sauce. The pasta was ordered with a side of asparagus and mushrooms. Surprisingly, the asparagus in the side was much better tasting, though it was a little too heavily salted.
The service at Justice Urban Tavern is fantastic. The waiters are attentive and polite, and catered to every need. There was a slight mishap when our table was confused for another, but that was quickly fixed and the rest of the time there was spent without issue. The food came out surprisingly quickly, and they were also very quick in bringing our check, despite the fact that there were many other people dining there as well.
Though some may not find the higher price tag worth a simple, delectable, brilliantly grilled burger, Justice Urban Tavern is definitely worth a look. The service is great, the atmosphere and décor are amazing and the food, while hit and miss, is definitely worth trying. It might not be as much of a value as the $10 ramen at nearby Daikokuya, but the extra few dollars nets you a better environment, significantly better service and a much shorter wait in line.

This weekend, student radio station KXSC will host the sixth annual KXSC Fest in Founders Park. The festival will feature live visual art installations, vintage clothes for sale, street art vendors, food trucks and, of course, the performing artists.
Festivus for the rest of us · KXSC Fest’s 2012 lineup featured indie-pop band STRFKR (pictured). This year’s lineup includes notable acts such as DJ Rasad + DJ Spin, Sun Araw, Kirin J. Callinan and more. – Andrea Shen | KXSC
 
“This year we are bringing it back outside, after we had it down in the ballroom,” Concerts Director Mikayla  Cowley said. “If it’s outside, it’s the best. Our headliners are featuring DJ Rashad and DJ Spinn — they’re hyped up and really awesome and rooted in the footwork scene … It’s just really great dancing music. And we have a special guest who I so wish we could announce, but we can’t because we have to wait to day of show.”
Despite the fact that 2,000 festivalgoers are expected to attend, Cowley said that the event had more humble beginnings just a few years ago.
“[In 2011], it was the first year where we brought in a huge crowd because we added Flying Lotus as the headliner of the fest,” Cowley said. “I was a freshman and totally jaded by the whole, ‘We’re having a music festival’ thing. The people before were like, ‘We kind of just put it on the lawn and picnic,’ but then it totally exploded. It really changed the scene and set the standard … It was a really great introduction to what the station does — seeing it grow from a few hundred people to a thousand in a matter of two hours that night was absolutely insane.”
Cowley said that one of the major differences between KXSC Fest and other music festivals is the emphasis placed on up-and-coming acts.
“We really want to bring out emerging artists because that’s what we’re interested in,” Cowley said. “We love scoping out what’s coming up next, who’s going to be big … We got STRFKR before they exploded via Facebook. I think to put a social media estimate on it, they had about 70,000 likes on their Facebook when we had them, and then we noticed that a bunch of other venues around L.A. were also booking STRFKR in the months after. Now STRFKR has 139,000 likes on Facebook … We like being able to show the world that these are good people you should be listening to because they are great artists.”
Though undiscovered talent does mean being the first to dig up undiscovered gems, Cowley said the process of booking acts is a long and tumultuous one, beginning with a mass email that she sends out to the KXSC staff and DJs, asking for the names of artists who they would be interested in seeing.
“I get several names in, and I also work in conjunction with our music director,” Cowley said. “We sit down and click around on blogs and websites. He’s seeing new music everyday — whether it’s good or bad — and he just throws names at me. I’ll sit there and think, ‘Will this person pair well with this person?’ It’s something that has to have a musical flow — you don’t want to interrupt it, you don’t want to have a jolting noise between two artists.”
Cowley said that it’s always important to take risks when it comes to networking and connecting with artists.
“I’m always of the belief of just try asking anyone — stay within budget, but why not ask this higher profile person because maybe they’ll do something,” she said. “We’re said ‘no’ to just as much as we’re said ‘yes’ to.”
Despite all of the excitement and good-natured fun surrounding the event, KXSC Fest encountered some challenges this past year when it came to funding.
“We are independent from the university, so all of our funding is via donations, sponsors we reach out to, or applying for funding, but there is never a set budget for Fest from USC or from the benefactor,” Cowley said. “Fest is something we begin planning in September. It’s really a yearlong venture, even though it’s just seemingly a spring event. It’s a money hunt — we’re reaching out to people who we want to work with but who are also interested in supporting the station.”
On top of that, the station’s costs increased this year due to increased security regulations, which arose last year when USC became a closed campus as a result of an on-campus shooting.
“When it was outside in previous years, we didn’t have to pay for fencing and we didn’t have to pay for a select number of DPS officers,” Cowley said. “Now we also have to pay for the fencing and even more DPS officers because of the new security additions that were added when USC became a closed campus. It definitely puts more of a financial strain because that cost falls on the student organizations — it’s not covered by the university.”
KXSC General Manager Anya Lehr said that, after reaching out to more than 200 sponsors, the station was only able to partner with three.
Cowley said that in addition to funding from sponsors, Fest received donations from alumni. KXSC’s family-like quality proved helpful in both fundraising and scouting for artists.
“Kirin J. Callinan was someone who we saw at the College Music Journal Fest in New York, and that was someone who we were like, ‘We want to bring him to Fest,’” Cowley said. “It’s totally a station-connected fest. Past years have also been the same, but this year it was really like reaching out to friends or people who are interested, and people came to us, too. It’s really cool when someone says, ‘Can we play Fest?’ especially in past years, when we needed to find someone. Our profile has risen.”
Despite the initial difficulty, the festival is bound to be a good time for all.
“We love bringing people together,” Cowley said. “What I think really is the core of the KXSC Fest is just bringing the community together through music — that’s what we do … I encourage everyone to come. We’re a big fan of people who dance, so you should be in the crowd dancing.”

On March 12, Everdream Pictures uploaded a fan-made commercial for the Tesla Model S titled “Modern Spaceship” to its YouTube channel. The video, which stars a young boy pretending to be an astronaut, has since garnered more than 350,000 views. The spot was produced by class of 2013 alumnus James Khabushani, who co-founded Everdream Pictures in his junior year at USC with a group of Chapman University students.
“It was … small,” said Khabushani. “We were just doing favors for people … We were doing small music videos for $2,000.”
Khabushani, who goes by his middle name James, graduated from Marshall in December 2013 with a B.S. degree in business administration. In his last semester at USC, Khabushani took a new media course in the School of Cinematic Arts taught by entrepreneur Diego Berdakin.
“It was by far my favorite class that I’ve taken at ’SC, and it was my last class,” Khabushani said.
Troy Carter, a music manager known for his role in establishing the career of Lady Gaga, was invited to give a guest lecture for the class. At the time, Berdakin was aware that Khabushani was working on a fan-made Tesla commercial, and encouraged him to show the unfinished product to Carter.
“And, well … He loved it,” Khabushani said.
Carter admired the product so much, he invited Khabushani to come share the project with employees at his management company, Atom Factory. Eventually, this led to the formation of a joint venture between Everdream Pictures and Atomic Factory. Right out of college, Khabushani found himself partnered with one of the heaviest hitters in the music and entertainment industry.
“It’s a big deal,” Khabushani said. “He’s a very sought-after individual, and to be partnered with him right out of school is incredible.”
The team at Everdream ended up finishing the commercial in November 2013, at which point they tried to get in contact with Tesla without success. Finally, in December, Everdream succeeded in meeting with Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.
“[Musk] loved the commercial. He said, ‘Stay in touch. Maybe we can do something in the future,’” Khabushani said.
From there, Everdream Pictures spent a few months planning the release of the commercial with the support of Tesla Motors, before finally premiering the commercial in early March.
“I want to strongly stress that this was a team effort,” Khabushani said.
The inspiration for the commercial actually came from directors Joe Sill and Andreas Attai.
“They got into a car accident together, and then they slept over at each others’ house, and somehow, they came up with the idea of doing a car commercial.”
Once the team had decided on a subject car, Khabushani reached out to his roommate, whose father owned a Model S, and traveled with a crew to his roommate’s San Francisco home to shoot the commercial.
Fan-made commercials for the Tesla Model S aren’t without precedent, partly due to the fact that Tesla Motors themselves have yet to produce an official commercial. “Gallons of Light,” another fan-made commercial which featured a family road trip in the Model S, was uploaded to YouTube more than a year before “Modern Spaceship.” Khabushani said that their commercial, however, was not inspired by any previous fan-made productions.
Khabushani also said his goal is to inspire current students.
“At USC, there’s this very subtle structure that exists. If you’re a finance guy, you have to go into banking, et cetera,” Khabushani said. “I was going down the investment banking path, and I just decided that I wanted to be an entrepreneur — to take the leap of faith … and right now is the best time to do this.”
Regarding Elon Musk’s proposal of working with Everdream in the future, Kabushani revealed only a few details.
“We’re definitely in the process of making more [commercials], probably making a few,” Khabushani said. “I’d probably give it a couple of months, though, for the next one to arrive.”

The semester is quickly drawing to a close, but that doesn’t mean the learning will be over by a long shot: A large number of USC students will spend their summers working at internships in their respective fields of expertise — of which many will be unpaid. Many students see unpaid internships as “paying dues” in an industry and providing prospective employers with a trial employment run. These unpaid internships are increasingly becoming the equivalent of part-time or full-time jobs. The fact remains, however, that unpaid internships are not only time-consuming for students whose time may be at a premium, but are also grossly advantageous to the companies who employ them.
Zach Schonfeld of Newsweek wrote an article last week stating that unpaid interns are not legally entitled to rights protecting employees, including basic civil protections against sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace.
Schonfeld cited the case of Lihuan Wang, a Chinese national who was an unpaid intern for Phoenix Satellite Television in New York City. Wang, who was sexually harassed by her supervisor at Phoenix, filed suit against her employer. Wang’s case was then dismissed in court on the grounds that as an unpaid intern she was not technically an employee of the company. The case exposed a legal loophole wherein employers could subject unpaid interns to discrimination and sexual harassment with relative impunity.
Though D.C. and the state of Oregon have protections in place to provide basic rights for unpaid interns, the state of California has yet to adopt such legislation. In Dec. 2013, Lydia O’Connor of the Huffington Post reported that Democrat Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner (Berkeley) would be introducing legislation in California to protect unpaid interns. But the law has yet to pass.
The debate on whether or not unpaid interns deserve similar basic protections as employees is not actually a debate — or is it? Cameron Keng argued that interns should be paid, if only because it protects companies from liability in lawsuits with regard to currently existing legislation regulating the extent of an unpaid intern’s duties.
Keng posts that interns are provided “the opportunity to build [a] resume,” and that interns ought to be paid if “they’re going to be entitled and possibly slap [companies] with lawsuits.”
There’s a troubling aspect of Keng’s statement here that actually reveals the crux of the problem with unpaid internships: Companies rely on the “hunger” or competitive drive of applicants to make it through hostile work environments. They rely on the “don’t ask, won’t tell” aspect of employment in order to take advantage of the free labor. Complaining about a hostile work environment or a lack of pay, in the eyes of those who share the views of Keng, is “entitled” behavior. Those who speak up for their rights face being labeled as a “whistleblower” or someone who “can’t stand the heat.” And nobody, including the writer whose name appears in the byline for this article, wants to be “that guy or girl.” But something needs to be said for the protection of basic rights for unpaid interns.
There’s a saying that nothing comes free, but the labor a company enjoys from an unpaid internship comes pretty damned close. So why not provide these workers’ basic rights? Shouldn’t a worker have the right to speak up after being inappropriately touched or interacted with in the workplace, in the context of a professional relationship, and not having to worry about losing his or her job, or worse, his or her reputation and opportunities for future employment?
On the flip side, unpaid internships can provide once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. Students have undoubtedly heard stories of the types of real-life professional experience they can gain from working at a big-time company. But all unpaid internships are not created equal, and the fact that unpaid internships are seen as an opportunity to get “a foot in the door,” reducing employment to a socioeconomic war of attrition, doesn’t make it more comforting.
The wisest compromise, of course, is an appropriate balance: no student should feel compelled to take on unpaid internships. The reality of the U.S. current job market, however, necessitates that interns “put in the work” to find out whether or not they are a “proper fit” for an organization. But legislation needs to be established that protects the rights of these workers.
The deceptively simple solution of paying these interns is actually not so simple: the amount of time required for “training,” which usually entails explaining legal procedures and reporting policies, can eat up valuable time and cost employers a considerable premium.
The current state of unpaid internships, however, is unacceptable. No worker, paid or unpaid, should have to worry about basic workplace rights. It’s time the California state legislature, and all states without such protections, move forward to establish the appropriate protections for unpaid interns.

In today’s world, schools and teachers are expected to provide more services and opportunities to their students than ever before. In addition to a top-notch education, U.S. public schools are mandated to provide healthy meals, exercise opportunities, financial literacy, productive and  after-school programs and amiable social settings for the thousands of children matriculating through the system each year. To meet these needs, many teachers are often asked to reach into their own pockets. According to the Los Angeles Times, a new initiative announced on Monday seeks to reduce the financial burden teachers regularly face. The initiative also has the potential to change the morale of teachers within the city.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
The initiative, called Grants HQ, seeks to educate teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District on how to write grants in order to request and subsequently receive funding for school programs and projects they are involved in. The Los Angeles Fund for Public Education, which was founded in 2011 as a way to create unconventional partnerships in order to improve students’ education, is sponsoring the initiative.
Through the initiative, teachers will be able to use a website with a searchable database to find grants that apply to the projects and programs they are focusing on in the classroom, according to the L.A. Fund website. The database will ideally help connect the LAUSD teachers to philanthropic organizations that could provide them with money for funding, according to the L.A. Times. For example, if a teacher is in charge of the robotics club, he or she can apply for a grant that financially supports the materials needed for building robots.
In addition, the initiative will offer workshops to teach grant writing, review all proposals and write letters of endorsement for selected ones, according to the  L.A. Fund website. This type of assistance for teachers is critical. The other tasks that they are paid to focus on should not be overshadowed by the growing importance of attempting to find funding for activities.
Furthermore, the initiative comes at a time when LAUSD is facing the possibility of losing $200 million in funding in the coming years, according to the Huffington Post. Nationally, teachers are experiencing the same cash-strapped scenarios.
According to a recent study by insurance firm Horace Mann, teachers are spending more of their personal funds for classroom supplies than in previous years because of school budgets across the country being slashed. The study showed that each year, 30 percent of teachers spend between $200-$400 of their own money on supplies, which has a larger impact considering teachers receive some of the lowest salaries in the country.
Though the initiative provides another outlet for teachers to alleviate their additional burdens, it should not turn the conversation away from the importance of pouring more directed money into a school system. Without that conversation taking place, the perennial problem of teachers having to find alternative routes of funding educational programs will not be addressed.
Overall, the initiative proves that teachers still have something to learn. Though teachers — for the most part — seamlessly impart knowledge to students in the classroom every day, an understanding of the process of receiving grants and funding to continue critical school programs is still lacking.
Grants HQ is a necessary first step in helping teachers provide a quality and holistic education to students. If successfully implemented, this pilot program could change the amount of avenues teachers have to fund activities in the classroom. It will also show the school system as a whole that there are other ways of contributing to children’s educations.
Despite its benefits, it should not replace the need to reevaluate the amount of funding school systems are receiving. But in the meantime, teaching teachers one more lesson can go a long way in contributing to students receiving the best education possible.

Hi Jordyn,
Thanks for informative article. I agree with you that this is a good move for the district to empower their teachers with this important information. However, it is definitely not a solution to the larger challenge at hand.  Grants HQ sounds like an interesting concept and I’m curious if you know of any other school district(s) doing something similar?

DJ Rashad and DJ Spinn won’t be the only big names hitting the sixth annual KXSC Fest this Saturday. Adding to the list of vintage clothing, art and record vendors are three of L.A.’s most popular food trucks, The Grilled Cheese Truck, Kogi Truck and Coolhaus, bringing a tasty treat to the evening of music in E.F. Hutton Park.

What’s not to love about America’s ultimate comfort food?
What started as a plan to enter their Cheesy Mac and Rib Melt in LA’s 7th Annual Grilled Cheese Invitational in 2007, the Grilled Cheese Truck has gained national recognition and widespread popularity. The craze for these sandwiches shows no signs of stopping, with food truck-goers waiting for as long as two hours for a sandwich during high-traffic meal times.
Putting a spin on the classic bread, cheese and butter sandwich, the Grilled Cheese Truck offers a classic plain and simple melt with eight cheese options and a variety of savory and sweet additions. Flavors range from the Sweet Sriracha Chicken Melt to the Cheesycake Melt, but the original Cheesy Mac and Rib has remained the truck’s bestseller.
Kogi Truck
When Mark Manguera and Roy Choi first thought of combining Korean and Mexican food, they didn’t expect much to come of their Korean barbecue tacos. Six years, and more than 2,000 Yelp reviews, later, Kogi Truck has become an icon of LA’s street food, offering a short and simple menu mixing the two very different cuisines.
Signature dishes, like the short rib tacos (corn tortillas topped with Korean-Mexican caramelized BBQ short ribs, salsa roja, cilantro-onion-lime relish and Kogi Truck’s signature soy Kogi slaw), are an LA staple, and other dishes, like the kimchi quesadilla and the Sriracha dessert bar, highlight the innovation behind Kogi Truck.
Coolhaus
Four words: custom ice cream sandwiches.

In 2008, Natasha Case and Freya Esteller found a way to combine food and architecture by baking cookies, making ice cream and naming flavor combinations after famous architects. In 2009, the two presented their Craigslist-bought food truck at Coachella and returned to L.A. with a huge fan base. Five years later, Coolhaus has 11 trucks, a store in Culver City and sandwiches in Whole Foods nationwide, all while maintaining its all-natural, handmade and organic reputation.
Coolhaus offers 16 different cookies and 65 rotating ice cream flavors (including vegan and gluten-free options for both), including classics like Mies Vanilla Rohe (vanilla ice cream, chocolate chip cookies) and Frank Berry (strawberry ice cream, snickerdoodle cookies), and some atypical options, like fried chicken & waffles, lychee martini sorbet and nutella rocky road and cookies comme chocolate chunk pretzel and potato chip & butterscotch. Customers can mix things up more by requesting different top and bottom cookies, and all wrappers are 100 percent edible and environmentally friendly.

While she was no Bella or Katniss, Divergent’s Tris Prior managed her debut just fine. The latest young adult fantasy adaptation from Lionsgate, Divergent, opened to a commendable $54.6M over the weekend.  While that’s lower than Twilight’s $69.6M and nowhere near The Hunger Games’ record-breaking $152.5M opening in 2012, it’s still a great launch for the film and stands as the third-largest opening for an action film with a female lead.
There was a lot riding on Divergent, not just for Lionsgate but for the young adult market. Nearly all of the recent young-adult adaptations have outright bombed, from Beautiful Creatures ($7.58M), The Host ($10.6M), and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones ($9.34M).
Lionsgate has fully committed to the property, though, giving the film a bigger budget than the first Hunger Games and getting some marquee names, including Oscar winner Kate Winslet. They are so committed to its success that they already plan to complete the trilogy, with Insurgent and Allegiant, lined up for March 2015 and 2016 releases respectively.
The marketing has been on overdrive since its trailer debut with The Hunger Games: Catching Fire in November. However, there was still some concern over just how well it would open. Both Twilight and The Hunger Games had the advantage of clearly defined conflicts: Bella and Edward’s romance is universally relatable and Katniss’s fight for survival in a post-apocalyptic America rings true not just with young adults, but with a wide range of audiences.
With Divergent, however, the stakes were never clearly defined. Trailers and sneak peeks never made clear just what, exactly, makes Shailene Woodley’s Tris Prior “different” or “special” beyond showing clips of people telling her that she’s different and that she’s at risk because of it.
Poor reviews likely won’t help convert people, with the primary complaint being that it really was trying too hard to be like Hunger Games. Its robust social media presence (it has the most Instagram followers of any film on the service) should, however, give it enough to make Lionsgate happy with its decision to move forward with the sequels.
Opening in second place was Muppets Most Wanted with $17M, which is slightly under modest expectations for the return of Kermit and company. Taking the motley crew on a European adventure akin to The Great Muppet Caper, the prominent marketing resulted in an opening that’s good for the franchise but not up to par for Disney.
The 2011 relaunch of The Muppets was executed about as well as possible, but its final gross of $88.63M had to be considered a bit disappointing considering it had the Disney marketing machine, received near-universal praise, opened on Thanksgiving weekend and had three Oscar-nominated songs.  It didn’t even have great legs, making 40% of its gross during its opening five days.
The sad truth is that one of the running jokes in The Muppets is a sad reality: many people may have simply stopped caring about the Muppets. While the 2011 film worked wonderfully as a love letter to fans and the forty-year-old characters, it seems to have done nothing to convert a younger generation that didn’t grow up with The Muppet Show or Muppet Babies. Outside of a relaunching of The Muppet Show, there may just be a limit to how well a Muppet movie can do in this day and age.
The biggest surprise this weekend was the Christian-based film God’s Not Dead, which managed $9.24M over the weekend, working out to a great $10,979 theater average, nearly twice as much as Muppets Most Wanted. The story of a student challenging an atheist philosophy professor (played by Hercules’ Kevin Sorbo) spoke directly to the devout and an appearance by Duck Dynasty’s Willie Robertson certainly helped.
