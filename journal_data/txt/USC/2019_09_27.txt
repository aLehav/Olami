The USC women’s volleyball team took a tough five-set loss to UCLA Wednesday at Pauley Pavilion. 
The Trojans came out of the gate firing on all cylinders. They executed kill opportunities and played effective defense, taking the first set by a wide margin of 25-12. 
The second set was a different story. The Bruins jumped out to an early 4-point lead, and service errors helped cause the Trojans’ comeback attempt to fall short. 
The third set didn’t go quite as USC planned, either. The Trojans struggled to find their rhythm and, like the rest of the game, were plagued by service errors. Sophomore setter Raquel Lázaro led an inspired comeback effort by diving all over the floor on defense, but it wasn’t enough. 
After jumping out to an early 1-0 set lead, the Trojans had given it up and trailed 2-1. 
The fourth set was an entirely different story as USC appeared to get its rhythm and chemistry back. A back-and-forth frame ultimately ended in the Trojans’ favor, 28-26, with the help of strong kills and key defensive stops. 
Despite serving first in the fifth set, the Trojans struggled. UCLA’s offense took off and USC had a hard time slowing it down. After finding themselves stuck with an early deficit, the Trojans started mounting a comeback, but the hole proved too deep. They lost the final set 15-12 and the match 3-2. 
Though USC lost in its first Pac-12 game of the season, head coach Brent Crouch said after the game that he isn’t worried about his team in the long run. 
“We think we’re a better team than what we showed tonight, and I don’t think we’re lacking in confidence,” he said. 
The team struggled to serve effectively all match, piling up 21 service errors. While the Trojans also struggled to communicate, senior middle blocker Jasmine Gross found a silver lining in their ability to nearly pull out a victory despite not playing their best game. 
“It’s cool because we have so much to improve and we were still so close,” Gross said. “So I think if we keep working everyday in practice [and] just on those little minor adjustments … if we clean up the tiny little things then you can prevent that from happening.”
USC’s schedule doesn’t get any easier from here. Gross and Crouch both agreed that the team will need to execute much better to take down 10-2 Arizona on Saturday. 
The Trojans picked up a hard-fought 3-2 victory the last time the two teams matched up, and USC is 65-22 all-time against the Wildcats. However, USC is still getting back into its rhythm after injuries disrupted the start of its season, and the Wildcats have opened the year on fire. 
Arizona has a strong defense that has tallied 606 digs this season in addition to 33 solo blocks. 
The Trojans hope for a packed Galen Center in their second home conference game of the season. 
“Volleyball is a fun sport and I don’t think people really understand,” Gross said. “It would be amazing if people could come support us … the crowd obviously helps a lot. 
The Trojans enter the match a perfect 3-0 at home this year and hope to extend this streak starting Saturday at 7 p.m.

Health officials announced that all surgeries at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center will be halted after mold contamination was discovered in a room used for sterilizing surgical equipment.
The hospital, located near the Health Sciences Campus, is under the jurisdiction of the L.A. County Department of Health Services. According to the Los Angeles Times, LAC+USC will be unable to perform surgery and other medical operations and procedures for an estimated two weeks. The Times reported that dental procedures will not be affected because its equipment is sterilized at another location.
The Times obtained an internal email from Chief Medical Officer Brad Spellberg that informed the hospital’s medical personnel about the discovery. In the email, Spellberg wrote that the Central Sterile processing room, which is used to sterilize all clinical supplies and equipment, suffered from mold contamination and water damage.
The Daily Trojan was unable to obtain the email. DHS and LAC+USC did not respond in time for publication.
It is unclear how many patients will be affected by the surgery or how many patients will be transferred to other facilities.
LAC+USC is a 600-bed facility and is one of the largest public hospitals in the nation. The center is affiliated with the Keck School of Medicine at USC and operates special units including a Burn Center, Trauma Center and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Many physicians and residents at the medical center, located in Boyle Heights, comprise USC faculty and students. 
According to the Times, the email said mold was discovered in the room in the last day or so and as of now, there is no information about who made the discovery. LAC+USC opened its doors in 2008.

Nearly 30 students silently walked out during an event hosted by USC’s Young Americans for Freedom Thursday that featured conservative speaker Michael Knowles, calling his rhetoric hateful, sexist and transphobic. Organizations that walked out of the event “Men Are Not Women and Other Uncomfortable Truths” are calling on the University to revoke YAF’s status as a Recognized Student Organization. 
More than 100 students came to watch Knowles, who opened the event with a joke concerning the validity of climate change. Shortly after, students from Trojan Advocates for Political Progress, Queer and Ally Students Assembly and other student organizations that were scattered among the crowd stood up and walked out, leaving behind a printed statement on their chairs that called for YAF’s RSO status to be revoked.  
The students then organized on the steps outside Doheny Memorial Library to ensure students knew their organizations provided safe spaces for students. Some members of the organizations also went to dinner afterward to discuss the event and help students decompress. Students said Knowles’ transphobic views and YAF’s sponsorship of speakers that use hateful rhetoric prompted them to leave. 
Knowles was set to begin his speaking tour in April at the University of Missouri-Kansas City at an event hosted by the campus’ YAF chapter. About 20 minutes into Knowles’ speech, a student protester disrupted the event when he threw a bleach-like substance onto Knowles, UMKC’s University News reported. The student was arrested and tazed by police. At USC, approximately eight officers from DPS and LAPD were present at the event. 
TAPP members left a printed statement on their chairs calling for USC to revoke YAF’s status as an RSO. TAPP claimed the University is unable to promote inclusivity if it also supports speakers like Knowles.
“YAF is an RSO, which grants them the privilege to reserve spaces and security for events like this,” the statement read. “However, hosting speakers who verbally attack women, as well as the LGBTQ+, disabled, Latinx, Muslim and Black communities blatantly violates one of the main responsibilities of an RSO.”
According to the USC Campus Activities website, RSOs cannot base membership, elections or other decisions and matters “on the basis of race, creed or religion, sex, age, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, medical condition and national origin.”
YAF Chairman Maxwell Brandon denied claims that YAF had discriminatory practices because he said any student could join the organization. He said students should be open to hearing all viewpoints and that a speaker’s controversial opinion does not make them invalid. 
“By [TAPP’s] logic, I could claim that College Democrats is discriminatory because I don’t agree with what they espouse, so since I’m not comfortable going to their meetings … they’re discriminating against me,” Brandon said.
During his address, Knowles said feminism and being transgender are mutually exclusive.
“The transgender definition of womanhood is often a caricature,” Knowles said. “Often it involves heavy makeup, sexualized clothing, big eyes, big eyelashes — I am thinking about ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race.’ That is one view of womanhood, and I am willing to wage that is not the view of womanhood that most feminists hold.”
Despite Knowles’ claims, there is no “transgender definition of womanhood.” According to the Human Rights Campaign, transgender is an umbrella term “for people whose gender identity and/or expression are different from cultural expectations based on the sex they were assigned at birth.”
TAPP Vice President of External Affairs Jessica O’Connor helped plan the walkout with members of the executive board and said she felt they should protest his transphobic rhetoric. TAPP also reached out to members of QuASA, Latinx Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly and the Native American Student Union to join them. 
“We wanted to walk out because we wanted to demonstrate that there are allies out here of the trans community,” O’Connor said. “There are students here who are paying attention, who are going to stand in solidarity.”
In its statement, TAPP said USC should not fund events like Knowles’ visit and the security that accompanied it. Brandon said YAF covered all funding for the event, including security costs, which he estimated totaled to about $7,000. When conservative commentator and Daily Wire editor-in-chief Ben Shapiro spoke on campus last October, Undergraduate Student Government covered $4,100 in security fees. 
Executive Director of QuASA Steven Vargas said inviting speakers like Knowles to campus fuels hate speech and could lead to harmful actions against the queer community and other minority groups. 
“Free speech is not discriminatory,” Vargas said. “The reason that free speech is there is so that people who are oppressed in our community are able to speak up against those who oppress us, and the kind of free speech that they are expressing is putting out and hammering down on what has been our history of discrimination, of oppressing the minority groups.”
Presley Baker, a member of YAF, said she enjoyed the opportunity to hear a conservative viewpoint on campus. She said TAPP and other organizations had the right to walk out, and she said she was glad everything was handled in a respectful manner. 
“I know we’re always trying to bring in more conservative speakers … so it’s great to have the difference of perspective,” said Baker, a sophomore majoring in journalism.
Prior to his visit, Knowles made headlines for his comments on Fox News Monday night about 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg after her speech to the United Nations on the risks posed by climate change.
“The climate hysteria movement is not about science,” Knowles said on Fox. “If it were about science, it would be led by scientists, rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left.”
Thunberg is one of the organizers of the #FridaysForFuture movement, a climate strike that involves thousands of students across the world march outside of local city halls and government buildings every Friday. She has since won the Right Livelihood Award, known as the “Alternative Nobel Prize,” and has also been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Fox apologized for Knowles’ comments on Thunberg, who has Asperger’s syndrome, in a statement to several media outlets. O’Connor said TAPP decided to organize the walkout before Knowles’ appearance on Fox.
“We didn’t want to give him any of our time. He’s not worth any of our time,” O’Connor said. “Nothing he has to say is worth our time. He illustrated that pretty well when he got banned from Fox News. He’s not even worth Fox News’ time.”

The USC Thornton Symphony has been performing on campus and around the country since the 1900s, with notable alumni performing in prestigious concert halls across the country and the world. Students in the symphony put in long hours both inside and outside of the classroom. And that is no different for the symphony’s performance this Friday, its second concert of the semester.
Friday’s performance will be conducted by Sharon Lavery, a Thornton School of Music associate professor and resident conductor of the symphony. Lavery teaches classical performance and composition, has conducted at Carnegie Hall and has served as music director of the Downey Symphony Orchestra since 2007. 
“I am most excited about seeing the students’ smiles of pride and accomplishment as they exit the stage after the last note,” Lavery said. “This will have been, for many of them, their second concert in just five short weeks of school.”
The symphony’s rehearsal schedule is intense, with hours of practice leading up to the concert. 
“The two-week preparation period begins with what we call sectionals, where we separate the wind players from the string players and invite various faculty members into the rehearsal to help coach them,” Lavery said. “For the second rehearsal, we bring everyone together for what we call a ‘tutti’ — meaning ‘all’ in Italian — rehearsal. By the time we get to Friday night’s concert, we will have had three more rehearsals after that.”
Students will perform the work of Antonín Dvorák, a Czech composer born in 1841. His compositions fuse the sounds of eastern Europe with influences from his time in the United States. They will be playing two pieces: “Carnival Overture” and “New World Symphony.” 
“In classical music, it’s not often that you find European composers influenced by American music,” said Aaron Blick, a second year graduate student studying musical performance and the symphony’s principal bassist. “Part of what makes this concert special is that a lot of [the music] is based on things that he heard when he was traveling through America in the 1800s.”
The bass, according to Blick, is an essential part of the symphony.
“The bass line is the lowest register, so we are playing all the lowest notes that you hear in the orchestra, most of the time in a rhythmic and supportive context,” Blick said. “It is the foundation of all the sound that is being put out.” 
Blick and the other bassists work with professor David Allen Moore, a Thornton graduate and renowned bassist. The opportunity to work with Moore is what draws many students — including Blick himself — to the program. 
“David’s an incredible teacher and musician,” Blick said. “Most of my lessons are spent working on new technical things that he’s been working out himself. A lot of times they are new ideas and ways of approaching the instrument that I haven’t really come across before.” 
The bassists are a close-knit group. They spend time together outside of the classroom and create a supportive learning environment within the symphony. They spend long hours together — when walking through Thornton, it is not uncommon to hear students practicing outside in the sunny California atmosphere. And they make time for one another outside of rehearsal, whether at beach days or just hanging out. 
“It is incredibly special,” Blick said. “Everyone here is extremely supportive.”
Admission to the symphony’s performance Friday is free and open to the public. The performance begins at 7:30 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium.

“Don’t you know? What matters the most is keeping humanity.” 
That line in the film may have been delivered as a moral declaration, but it is also a basic question of screenwriting 101: How can we best bring a character to life, as a believable and three-dimensional person without relying on tropes that render them flat and utterly predictable?
Takashi Miike has a masterclass to offer on this subject in his body of work, a streak he continues in his latest film “First Love.” 
The film was screened for students and faculty at the School of Cinematic Arts’ Michelle and Kevin Douglas IMAX Theatre Tuesday as part of SCA’s weekly Outside the Box [Office] international film showcase. 
The noir-tinged gangster action-comedy follows an unlikely pairing between up-and-coming boxer Leo (Masataka Kubota), who has recently learned he has mere weeks to live, and drug-addicted call girl Monica (Sakurako Konishi). Monica runs into Leo while escaping the hallucinated ghost of her abusive father on the grimy streets of Tokyo.
Through a string of crazy coincidences (which make the film a true Miike narrative), the two somehow become scapegoats in a drug heist by mid-level gangster Kase (Shôta Sometani) during a fierce turf war between a waning local Yakuza branch and the Chinese Triads encroaching on their territory. What ensues is a beautiful chaos of personalities, blood and betrayals that gets more and more fun as the night goes on.  
In spite of the lost and hopeless souls that navigate the narrative, Miike imbues the film with a flippant ‘c’est la vie’ sort of attitude that might be distantly discomforting. He makes a dancing joke out of the ghost of Yuri’s abusive father, and as Kase’s failed wannabe-Machiavellian trysts continue to churn out an unintentional yet brutal body count, you can’t help but laugh at the outrageous, morbid ways in which things have gone wrong because of the blasé way he shrugs them off as nothing more than a grating inconvenience. It’s a little tame by Miike standards (for comparison, his 2001 “Ichi the Killer” was banned for showing and distribution in several countries due to its graphic content), but overall, it is quick-witted and wildly entertaining. 
You never doubt that Miike loves all his characters. It is Monica’s circumstances, not her character, that make her an object of pity, and Miike never ceases to remind us that through a bout of chance on one crazy night, those circumstances can be redeemed. Leo’s journey from wayward fighter without purpose to reluctant hero with no fear of death (which is, in a way, a superpower) brews with potential and hope. 
With such a large ensemble cast, there is a feeling that none of them get as much screen time as they should, but from their introductions to their untimely deaths, each character arc is made thoroughly memorable. And amid rolling heads and ringing shots, this is still a sweet story of blossoming trust between a boy and girl — a little clichéd, a little simple to follow, but genuine nevertheless. It’s a crowd-pleaser for sure. 
So while the level of ultraviolence may be daunting and most of the players are not left standing at the end of the film, in a roundabout way there’s a saccharine-sweet core to this morbid Yakuza flick. Even the most sentimental (though maybe not squeamish) viewers will be heartened to know that in his 103rd feature, the veteran Miike doesn’t fail to capture the essence of Hatsukoi — of sweet, sincere “First Love.”

I was 9 years old when “Modern Family” first aired in 2009, and I watched the show religiously. I remember how much of a hit it was for children and adults alike, how lauded it was for its progressive material. Wednesday night, ABC aired the first episode of the show’s 11th and final season. That struck a nostalgic chord in me, and I found myself rewatching the pilot. That’s when I realized — a lot has changed in 10 years, and we’ve been around for all of it.
Rewatching the pilot made me feel like I was experiencing a tangible manifestation of social change. When it began airing, “Modern Family” was praised for being progressive — it was one of the first network sitcoms that followed a gay couple, Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cam (Eric Stonestreet), on their journey to adopt a baby. It was applauded for its ethnic diversity in the casting of Sofia Vergara as Gloria and Rico Rodriguez as Manny. In 2010, it won six Emmy Awards, including the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. The consensus was overwhelmingly positive: “Modern Family” was taking a big step in the right direction.
And while that still holds true a decade later, the show’s pilot probably wouldn’t even meet anyone’s standards today. I’m not just saying that to be a stickler — watching that same pilot in 2019, the lack of representation and sensitivity jumped out at me. Aside from Gloria and Manny, the main cast does not feature a single person of color. The Dunphys, while hilarious, are a white, upper-middle-class family from California — far from the average American family. Gloria’s character is a two-dimensional trope of negative Latinx stereotypes. Need a little more convincing? Jay Pritchett (Ed O’Neill), Mitch’s dad, refers to his son’s newly adopted Vietnamese baby as a “potsticker.” Yikes.
What really got me thinking, though, was the fact that every couple in the pilot was married except for Mitch and Cam — and not because they didn’t want to get married, but because in 2009, gay marriage was illegal, even in California. 
Though the 2009 pilot does not fit into a 2019 framework, that’s not a bad thing. In fact, it is quite the opposite. It’s a great thing that in the past decade — a decade my peers and I experienced and played a significant role in — enough has changed that something viewed as highly progressive in 2009 can be astutely criticized today. It’s a great thing that the issue of representation in the media has become so prevalent that the show’s shortcomings presented themselves to me as big, fat red flags. Most importantly, it was a wild feeling to watch that pilot as a 20-year-old and think, “From start to finish, we’ve been here for all of this.” It makes progress feel tangible, and it makes me hopeful that our generation will continue to witness and enact change on a greater scale, at greater velocity, throughout the rest of our lives.  
At a time when it’s easy to feel disillusioned and to focus on all the work that has yet to be done in our society, we tend to forget that we are an integral part of the work being done right now. It may take patience to reap the fruits of change, but paradigms have shifted and are continuing to shift. The show’s trajectory throughout the last decade is a testament to that.
And as the show’s time on air comes to an end, I have no doubt that the next hit family sitcom will make up for what “Modern Family” lacked in representation, in social awareness, in substance. I have no doubt that its pilot will be celebrated for the progress it reflects. And I have no doubt that 10 years from now, we’ll have conquered yet another slew of beasts and will be taking on the next challenge.
