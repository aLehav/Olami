The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Friday, March 28, and Saturday, March 29. 
 
Crimes against a person
at 1:18 a.m. on March 29, a security guard reported that a student punched him in the chest after being denied entry to a party at the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity house and also struck him with a piece of lumber when he was pursued into a construction site. DPS officers located and detained the student and he was arrested and transferred to Metropolitan Detention Center for booking.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 1:50 a.m. on  March 28, an undisclosed number of USC students were cited for possession of fake IDs at the 901 Bar & Grill.
at 8:11 p.m. on March 28, a USC employee reported he found a clear plastic bag  outside the Elizabeth von Kleinsmid Memorial Residence Hall that appeared to contain marijuana. The bag was booked as evidence.
at 1:40 a.m. on March 29, a student reported that another student spat on him and attempted to slap him several times during an argument on Adams Boulevard.
at 4:05 p.m. on March 29, DPS officers confiscated a sword from a non-USC male at Cromwell Field. Upon doing so, the officers were contacted by a staff member who stated that the sword belonged to her and it was being used as a prop for an event. The officers advised the staff member that it was a violation of the law and university policy to bring the sword on campus, and she complied when they instructed her to place it in her vehicle for the duration of the event.

Amid concerns and claims of unprofessional police interactions in the past few years, students, faculty and law enforcement officers gathered at a Black Student Assembly meeting Monday evening to discuss police accountability and student rights.
Candid · Officers from the Department of Public Safety, Los Angeles Police Department and California Highway Patrol answer questions. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Held in Grace Ford Salvatori Hall, more than 50 people attended and participated in the conversation.
The topic centered on educating students on how to interact with the police when they are stopped on and around campus.
“It’s critical and important to know what to do when you interact with law enforcement and go about effectively voicing your redress,” said Dept. of Public Safety Chief John Thomas.
Various law enforcement agencies, such as the Los Angeles Police Department, California Highway Patrol and Los Angeles County Sheriff, were represented at the meeting, which was co-sponsored by the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and the USC Department of Public Safety.
When Chief Thomas asked if anyone in the room had ever been stopped by law enforcement, particularly by a member of LAPD, several students raised their hands.
Last May, 79 LAPD officers broke up a predominantly African-American student party which led students to claim racial profiling and use of excessive force. This resulted in students hosting forums and sit-ins during the last few weeks of the 2012-13 school year.
When explaining how to address being stopped by a member of law enforcement, the officers said that it is important to follow the instructions of the officer and then ask the necessary questions later.
In addition, all the officers stressed that one of the most important elements is keeping lines of communication open with the agencies.
“Don’t ever feel like you need to do something spectacular like write long letters and memos,” said Lt. Kerry Carter of the Los Angeles Sheriff Department. “All you really need to do is report it.”
All of the agencies said that they can be reached in person, by email, phone and even on Facebook. The panelists also told students that when they are in the process of reporting an officer, students should make it clear that they would like to formally file a complaint.
“As community members you have a lot of power — with great power comes great responsibility,” said Officer Dave Love of LAPD. “I encourage you to make the complaint when necessary. But I also encourage you to write a letter when an officer does something good.”
In addition, officers told students that they should be treated with professionalism in order to build better ties between residents and law enforcement.
“People are owed an explanation, but to some officers they feel that if telling you why it weakens the position,” said DPS Captain Ed Palmer, who formerly worked at LAPD for 28 years. “It doesn’t weaken the officer’s position, it actually strengthens community ties.”
Briana Savage, a sophomore majoring in international relations, found the panel particularly valuable because she was a student not familiar with the local law enforcement.
“This event was … educational,” said Briana Savage, who is originally from the East Coast. “I commend the panel for shedding light on the shortcomings within the various departments instead of masking the issues.”
Overall, officers stressed the importance of students’ voices, especially among students who have had negative experiences with law enforcement.
“Don’t think that your voice is not heard,” said Veta Fleeton of the California Highway Patrol. “Don’t just talk to someone about it. Talk to someone who can do something about it.”

A two-day conference hosted by the USC School of Social Work has spawned a new data collaboration between researchers and policymakers.
The Children’s Data Network kicked off at the event, titled “Advancing Science of Children’s Services Through Large Data,” with the goal of using administrative data to generate research relating to policies and programs affecting children.
More than 100 people participated in the event, representing state and county governments, researchers, foundations and L.A. partner organizations. This kind of collaboration between such a diverse group of children’s health professionals and academics is unusual.
“It is exceptionally rare to bring together the most prominent thought leaders in child welfare for the exchange of ideas about future data development, issues in large administrative database use and other related questions,” said Marilyn Flynn, dean of the School of Social Work, in a press release. “It changes and advances the dialogue on how we can better understand and create relevant policies addressing children’s needs.”
A major breakthrough resulted from this conference will be the linking together of state- and county-level data sources. This will allow both social workers, researchers and others involved in child welfare to have a more complete profile of the factors affecting a child. The collaboration between universities, local and state governments will hopefully make strides in the study of social work in addition to more effective policymaking.
The presentations focused on the importance of linking data, making data available to universities and community stakeholders, the use of data in holistic evaluation of children and the appropriate methods for obtaining and organizing data.
“The CDN is not just about researchers in an academic setting crunching numbers,” said assistant professor Emily Putnam-Hornstein in a press release. ”We want it to be a collaborative project where the work that emerges is actionable and relevant.”
Putnam-Hornstein noted that as a whole, the conference served to garner interest in the new program.
“We viewed the convening as an opportunity to get people excited about the potential of the network,” Putnam-Hornstein said in a press release.

On Monday evening, Brandon Stanton, founder of the popular photography blog “Humans of New York,” spoke to students in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Grand Ballroom about how he went from being a bonds trader in Chicago to a photojournalist in New York City.
Cross country · Brandon Stanton, founder of the photography blog “Humans of New York,” spoke to audience members about the benefits of photography and his journey in photojournalism in the Ronald Tutor Center Ballroom on Monday night. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
The event was a collaboration between USC Spectrum, USC Speakers Committee, USC Performing Arts Committee and USC Special Events Committee. It was part of the university’s first annual Arts Week, which has events running from March 31 to April 6.
Stanton has been photographing and interviewing people in New York for his site since November 2010. The blog has gained a mass following, with currently more than 4 million likes on Facebook. Stanton also has a New York Times bestselling book, Humans of New York.
Each photograph of a pedestrian on the streets of the city is accompanied by a short quote or anecdote that the subject told Stanton.
“As long as someone is being open and honest, I’ll sit with them for as long as it takes,” Stanton said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I’m normally looking for a quote specific to that person, that I’ve never heard before. Normally that comes in the form of a story.”
Throughout his talk, Stanton emphasized how “Humans of New York” became successful because he focused on his work and on being unique in a sea of photographers.
“It’s more important to be different than to be good if you want to get noticed,” Stanton said.
To get to the point that it’s at now, Stanton said “Humans of New York” went through many evolutions.
“Every time I found something that I thought was different than what everybody else was doing, I immediately stopped focusing on everything else,” he said.
The unique format of “Humans of New York,” as well as its popularity and success, has inspired many spinoff blogs for other cities. Victoria Kasar, a senior majoring in business administration and international relations (global business), even created a “Humans of USC” Facebook page in January.
“Part of the reason why I started it is because, much like New York, much like L.A., there’s so much diversity at this school,” Kasar said. “But not necessarily that [people are] aware of one another, because everyone has their own community.”
During the question and answer session that followed Stanton’s presentation, Kasar asked him about what he thinks of spinoff blogs.
“To be absolutely honest, when I was first getting started I was nervous because I hadn’t made an income yet,” Stanton said. “Because ‘Humans of New York’ is a very awesome concept, but it was also kind of a brand for my art at this time.”
Stanton said, however, that he has since changed his perspective.
“If you let go of this idea of, like, watermarking everything … then you kind of unlock the magic of the Internet, which is for people to kind of stumble upon your work in unconventional ways,” he said.
Though the blog has had multiple incarnations, Stanton was able to sum up its current form in one sentence.
“Really at its core, it’s telling intimate stories about strangers.”
Students’ reactions to event were very positive.
Asher Genoot, a sophomore majoring in accounting and business administration, considered Stanton’s journey to be admirable.
“I came into it very open-minded … I just find it kind of amazing, like, how really his whole mentality of just work hard and everything will pay off and that’s what I’ve seen,” Genoot said.
Waiz Rahim, a sophomore  majoring in industrial and systems engineering, noted Brandon’s journey has inspired his own work ethic.
“The way he got emotional talking about his entire experience — and as an artist myself — it really reminds you to focus on your content rather than your expectations,” Rahim said.

When former USC head coach Ed Orgeron sent in his resignation to Athletic Director Pat Haden, Trojan fans must have been experiencing that “Here we go again” feeling. Two months earlier, following a 21-point loss to Arizona State, Haden chose to make a coaching change midseason. Two months later, after USC’s 21-point loss to UCLA, its second straight loss to the Bruins and first at home since 1997, USC players were again forced into a transitional phase.
Steve Sarkisian was announced as USC’s newest head coach on Dec. 2, 2013, and though the decision was met with shock and excitement, it also brought about questions: Was he a “big name?” Who else was available? And why make this decision now?
But perhaps the biggest question was how Sarkisian would be able to earn favor among his new players, and whether or not the team’s morale would plummet after yet another change in the coaching staff.
Ever since the bottom fell out of USC’s 2013 season during the team’s abysmal 1-5 finish to the season, a black cloud seemed to loom over former coach Lane Kiffin and the rest of the program. When Kiffin was let go and Orgeron was chosen to replace him, his tenure got off to a rocky start after a seven-point win over Arizona and a 14-10 loss to rival Notre Dame.
The team’s fortunes turned around in a hurry, with Orgeron preaching love and toughness and the players embracing the new mantra, “One team, one heartbeat.” The wins piled up and team leaders such as redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler and redshirt senior linebacker Hayes Pullard constantly pledged their loyalty to the man they called Coach O.
But just as quickly as Orgeron seemed to brighten spirits around the John McKay Center, the atmosphere surrounding USC football changed. When Sarkisian was tabbed as the new head coach, Orgeron immediately resigned and was reportedly “outraged” about being passed over. Current offensive coordinator Clay Helton was named interim head coach for the Las Vegas Bowl, a middle-tier bowl game against feisty non-BCS Fresno State that appeared to have all the makings of a letdown performance from the Trojans.
Unlike last season’s Sun Bowl, USC didn’t lay down for this game. Instead, the Trojans dominated with a 45-20 dismantling of the No. 21 Bulldogs behind a career-high 344-yard passing performance by Kessler.
From that day forward, a buzz has surrounded the program, and Sarkisian has wisely embraced it. In his first meeting with the team, Sarkisian took the approach that he needed to win over his new locker room. In the months since, it appears as if he is well on his way to doing just that.
“He’s a great coach, and we look up to him as a defense,” Pullard said. “We’re buying into everything he’s doing and looking to be able to capitalize on it when we come on the field.”
Where Kiffin was often tense and reserved with the media, Sarkisian is relaxed and outgoing, attributes that translate to the practice field with his players.
With an offense predicated on quick pace, Sarkisian and his assistants are constantly running, diving and hollering with players during drills and scrimmages. Shouts of “No walking!” are routinely heard, with players scrambling to their proper assignments in a frenzy of controlled chaos.
An emphasis on speed has naturally led to an increase in mistakes as the players adapt to a new system. These mistakes are not punished, or even reprimanded, but rather embraced and viewed as opportunities for improvement.
“When you make a mistake, you don’t want to get yelled at, because it puts you in a mood like you don’t know how to play,” said redshirt freshman cornerback Chris Hawkins. “When you make a mistake, and [Sarkisian] says, ‘Don’t worry about it, we’re gonna fix it,’ that keeps you in the spirit, and you can still play fast.”
With a philosophy centered on positivity and constant activity, Sarkisian seems to have found a winning combination.
“When I was a player, I always appreciated the practices that went quickly, where you get a lot of work done in a short amount of time,” Sarkisian said. “I think [the players] appreciate that they’re not standing out here for three hours and losing focus and interest. We keep them focused, we keep them upbeat and energized. We have a lot of fun, but we work hard, and I think the players appreciate that.”
Though last year’s 10-4 record, given the players’ adverse conditions, was somewhat of a miracle, the harsh reality is that more wins will be expected, basically immediately. With a bevy of talented players returning on both sides of the ball, losses to UCLA and Notre Dame will not be tolerated, and Sarkisian is fully aware of that fact.
With the team’s season opener a long five months away, however, positive practices will have to do when trying to assess the Trojans’ new head coach, and by that measure the new era of USC football is off to a good start.
For a team that’s seen so much change in the past year, perhaps the players can finally settle into a routine — move quickly, and ask questions later.

Last week, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that a group of football players at Northwestern had the legal right to form a union and engage in collective bargaining, reigniting the age-old debate about whether or not college athletes deserve to be compensated. Daily Trojan sports columnists Nick Selbe, Will Laws, Darian Nourian and Nick Burton as well as Sports Editor Will Hanley gave their opinions on the complexities of the issue regarding paying college athletes.
Pay-for-play · Athletic Director Pat Haden has previously stated that student-athletes at USC are treated well and have no reason to unionize. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Q: Do you think college athletes deserve to unionize?
Nourian: I don’t believe they have the right to unionize because, at the end of the day, they are student-athletes of the university, not employees. Players unionizing to collectively bargain calls into question the aspect of amateurism among these athletes and jeopardizes the integrity of college athletics. These players were initially recruited to play for their respective schools and represent their colors loud and proud, while receiving a discounted and quality education simultaneously. This is an opportunity that is rare and not given to everyone, so student-athletes should take advantage of it and embrace their four or five years, rather than trying to “change the game” by forever altering the scope of college athletics.
Burton: I’m torn. My first reaction is sure, why not? They work very hard and really do have some extra responsibilities from “normal” students. I do not think they should be paid, however, and I do believe unionization sets us down that path.
Hanley: Absolutely. Even if you feel that NCAA athletes should not receive salaries for their play beyond a scholarship, you can still accept their unionization. According to the National College Players’ Association’s website, the group has five goals. Interestingly, as Jason Kirk of SB Nation notes, not one of these goals mentions salary for play. Most of the union’s goals deal with keeping college athletes medically and academically sound, areas in which the NCAA is seriously lacking. Because of the limitations of even a “full” scholarship, many former college football players are left out in the cold when dealing with post-career injuries. All the union seeks to do is improve the lives of these student-athletes in basic areas.
Q: Do you think NCAA athletes will receive some form of compensation in the near future?
Nourian: No, just simply because it’s not feasible or possible. Like in professional sports, there are big markets (big schools) and small markets (small schools) and there is no universal dollar amount that will make all schools happy.
Burton: First of all, a full (or partial) scholarship is a fairly significant form of compensation in and of itself. At USC, the value of a four-year full scholarship is probably in excess of a quarter-million dollars. In the near future, I don’t see that changing.
Laws: Yes. The Ed O’Bannon case was one of the first big steps in casting a poor light on the NCAA, which has created a unique situation for itself. The extensive media coverage of college athletics rakes in millions of dollars for the NCAA — but it also has created high-profile personalities out of athletes who were not compensated for their accomplishments in college. Pro-reform advocates and former student-athletes such as Jay Bilas now have enormous platforms on ESPN and other broadcast networks to reveal the hypocrisy of the NCAA and pressure them into paying the college athletes of the future.
Selbe: I think that NCAA athletes deserve the freedom to pursue their own personal interests outside of payment from the schools. Players should be able to receive payment for game-used jerseys, tickets or having their likeness used in video games. Punishing players for selling things that belong to them doesn’t seem right to me.
 
Q: Do you think college athletes should receive additional compensation, aside from scholarship benefits?
Nourian: I’m all in favor of additional or increased stipends to student-athletes since their job is basically playing varsity athletics and they don’t have time to partake in a separate money-making job. I feel that this would be beneficial in allowing students to make a better and more comfortable living while at school.
Selbe: I don’t think schools should have to give athletes more than a scholarship. When people advocate an increase in pay for college athletes, they mostly point to the huge profits that schools make on athletics. But this profit comes almost entirely from football programs (sometimes men’s basketball), and these profit-making programs fund all other athletic programs. I don’t think that schools should have to pay more for athletes of programs that cost the school money in the first place.
Hanley: I do, to an extent. A large portion of the obscene amount of money that a university makes from its athletes should be allocated to beefing up the medical and academic resources given to those student-athletes. The question of whether college athletes deserve a pure pay-for-play system, however, troubles me. Whatever its limitations, and there are many, an athletic scholarship is an incredibly valuable resource that should not be taken lightly. At a private school like USC, the monetary value of a full scholarship is $184,000 in tuition alone over four years. At a public school like Arizona State, a four-year full scholarship would be worth $40,000 or less in tuition. I can’t say I’ll ever really know if a college football player deserves more than this for their play.
 
Q: If so, would some athletes deserve more than others?
Nourian: No, this is exactly why it’s not plausible to actually compensate athletes in the first place. All athletes would have to receive the same benefit or stipend should the system be considered to be fair and nondiscriminatory.
Burton: This is actually the very reason I don’t believe college athletes should be paid. It would be logistically impossible. If some make more than others, it’s unfair. If everyone makes the same amount, that is also unfair.
Laws: I don’t think so. That could create a hyper-competitive culture within college teams that just wouldn’t feel right among the “purity” of college sports. If college athletes are to be paid for attending a school, they must receive the same amount. And if they’re going to reap the royalties from profits gained from jersey sales and other merchandise that use their likeness, I’d think that there would have to be some sort of revenue-sharing system created to make sure that there’s not any animosity between star players and their lesser-known teammates. Otherwise, the benchwarmers who are still living paycheck to paycheck could grow to harbor feelings of jealousy and inadequacy compared to the big-time players that might have just caught a lucky break where they didn’t.

USC baseball took a beating from the red-hot Washington Huskies this past weekend, losing all three matchups in the series. Each game told a slightly different tale of missed opportunities and tragic mistakes, both offensively and defensively.
I like big bunts · Senior infielder Kevin Swick leads the Trojans with a .340 batting average this season, up from his .305 average last year. Swick recorded two hits against the Dirtbags when the teams faced off in February. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
The Trojans started out shaky on the mound Friday night before eventually losing 8-2. Saturday’s match was an even bigger catastrophe in terms of pitching and defense, as the Huskies managed to put at least one run on the board every inning before eventually toppling USC in a 19-4 win.
Sunday’s game proved to be far more competitive as the Trojans battled the Huskies through 14 innings before an unsatisfactory performance by some members of the Trojans’ bullpen decided the game at 8-3 in favor of Washington during the 14th inning.
USC head coach Dan Hubbs reflected on the shortcomings of this weekend’s series.
“We didn’t throw the ball well, obviously, and Washington did an excellent job in hammering any mistakes we made and we made a lot of mistakes,” Hubbs said. “We couldn’t do anything at all this weekend whether that was hitting, pitching or playing defense, which is the most frustrating thing.”
The Trojans also struggled offensively against the impressive Husky pitching staff that held the Trojans to four runs or fewer throughout the series.
“Maybe we put too much pressure on ourselves because the team was hitting the ball so well before this weekend,” Hubbs said. “We kept trying to make plays that we didn’t need to make, and if we had kept things solid and simple then we would’ve been OK. It was obviously a disappointing weekend.”
Hubbs and the team hope that this week brings about a fresh start and an opportunity to rekindle the winning streak.
The Trojans will be hosting the Long Beach State Dirtbags at USC’s Dedeaux Field tonight at 6 p.m.
The last time the two teams met, the Trojans took a tough 2-1 loss on Feb. 25. Since then, the Trojans have gone 6-12 in contrast with the Dirtbags’ 10-8 mark. Both teams are currently .500 for the season.
Despite the fact that the Trojans lost to Long Beach State the first time around, Hubbs said he feels that USC can end its current slump and come out with a win tonight, provided the team comes ready to play.
“I think the guys are still feeling really frustrated about last weekend’s series, but now it’s time to get back in the ring and take on Long Beach State,” Hubbs said. “Our guys battled really hard on Sunday, and I think that’s a good indication of the way they’ll come out against Long Beach.”
As the season approaches the midway point, the Trojans are reaffirming their goals and strategies to ensure a successful second half to the season despite last weekend’s unfortunate showing.
Hubbs feels optimistic that the team can once again start winning tough games.
“Luckily we still have a game tomorrow, and hopefully we’ll be able to start turning things around,” Hubbs said. “Thankfully we’re not quite halfway through the season yet, so we’ve got a lot of time left to get rollin’ and start coming through in big ways during big games.”
Hubbs is all talk. Team has gone 6 and 13 since opening with 7 straight wins of which six were a gift all at home.
The series with UW was a farce all around..  Obvious Haden didn’t want Hubbs back this year offering a Million
$ to Savage to crosstown from Westwood. Why the search for a new coach stopped after that is a mystery?

The first time I hiked Runyon Canyon, I couldn’t even find the entrance. I aimlessly maneuvered my car, a beat-up and blue ’98 Ford Escort, up the windy Hollywood Hills. I remember focusing mostly on not driving off the road during the turns.
Out of desperation, I finally rolled down the window (my car is so old you have to manually turn the crank) and shouted to the nearest person I could see walking if he knew the way to the nearest trailhead.
The guy tensed when he first saw me make eye contact, but after he heard my question, he pointed to the left, his head ducked down, and replied, “That way.”
I thanked him and rolled my window back up. It was then that I noticed my friend in the passenger seat looking at me with wide eyes.
“Do you know who that was?”
I shook my head no.
“That was B.J. Novak! The guy from The Office.”
I can’t confirm if it actually was B.J. Novak that day, but it wouldn’t surprise me if it was him. As I’ve since learned, Runyon Canyon isn’t so much a hike as it is an experience — a place to see and be seen.
This was a foreign idea to me at the time. I grew up thinking that hikes were supposed to be about working out. You dressed for them in ratty T-shirts and embarrassing spandex. But that is not the case at Runyon Canyon.
If the hike to the Hollywood Sign is for the tourists, then the Runyon Canyon hike is for the beautiful people. For you less-than-beautiful-people, the hike offers a view of the city skyline (all of approximately 10 buildings, though more are cropping up these days), the Hollywood sign and even a peek of the Santa Monica beach on clear days.
Runyon is also a Bill Hader impression waiting to happen. One can almost see Hader as Stefon, the city correspondent on Saturday Night Live, gleefully putting his hands to his cheek bones to tell Seth Meyers that this hike has “everything.”
Indeed, the official website for Runyon Canyon uses that exact phrasing when describing the 160-acre park: “smack dab in the heart of everything.” If it was possible for a hike to have an ego, then this hike’s ego would be as inflated as the city it’s based in.
That’s not a bad thing, though.
Walking Runyon feels like you’re taking the pulse of the city. Go on a Saturday morning and you’ll see L.A. kids slightly hungover, decked out in designer apparel and shades, walking their dogs and watching people watch them. Truly, Runyon is the place to go when you want a taste of Hollywood, or at least, what popular culture tries to depict it as.
I know the point of this column is supposed to address the sides of Los Angeles that aren’t so stereotypical. But it would be remiss to ignore the pieces of the city that help contribute to the stereotypes, as they really do help explain the city in their own ways.
Having lived on both the East and West Coasts, one of the things that fascinates me the most about living here is the lack of social stratification. I’m not saying it doesn’t exist (if you don’t believe me, just go to Beverly Hills), but it just feels less important here. If you’re on the lower end of the totem pole, that could change with your next audition or startup idea.
Just like the Runyon Canyon website, which arrogantly brags about being in the center of universe, we, the citizens of Los Angeles, all have the attitude that we are “someone.” Whether we actually are is up for debate -— but that’s not important. As any struggling actress will tell you, what we are and what we will be is purely logistics.
I think a lot of this attitude has to do with our outdoor lifestyle. On the East Coast, the colder weather allows people to stay secluded based on where they can afford to hang out. Those with more money can live worlds away from those with shallow pockets. Because of this, maybe it’s harder on that side of the coast to see how the other half lives, let alone imagine joining their ranks.
The sunshine and the accessible outdoors in Los Angeles make it easy for people from all different walks of life to brush elbows. My ’98 Escort and I are just as welcome at Runyon Canyon as any celebrity. The parking is free, and the trail isn’t private. As I walk the trail and look at people, they look back at me. We are all wondering who the other is, what they have done. Sure, that way of thinking has lead to countless reality TV stars obnoxiously Instagramming their every movement. But I’d much rather live in a society where people believe that one day they can be as important as they want to be.
When I pulled up to the Runyon Canyon trailhead this weekend, a guy and a girl were stretching near the entrance. Both looked like models. The girl, who wore a bored expression, was wearing what looked like an expensive T-shirt that read: “So excited to be here.”
She could have been a celebrity, she could have been an electrical engineer — who knows? The magic of Runyon Canyon is that it doesn’t matter. She could be whoever she wanted to be.
Indeed, that’s why hiking Runyon is fun. It’s still not what I traditionally think of as a hike, but it reinforces the sense that in this city, you are only a few steps away from whatever you want to do. All it comes down to is finding the right trailhead.

Modern art has always been a topic of controversy. Though many appreciate the subjectivity of modern art because of the creative process in deciphering an artist’s intentions, others deem it “too abstract” and refuse to believe such simplicity should be recognized as art. Helen Pashgian’s new exhibition, “Light Invisible,” at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art falls somewhere on this unclear spectrum of appreciation versus rejection.
Light ’em up · Contemporary artist Helen Pashgian’s exhibit is on display now at LACMA. The show, titled “Light Invisible,” is Pashgian’s first large-scale sculptural show. It runs now through June 29. – Photo courtesy of Paris Photo
At first sight, the exhibition seems unusual. Visitors are guided into a pitch-black room in the Art of the Americas building, where molded acrylic columns stand in a line. The vision is confusing yet magical. But what really makes Pashgian’s installation stand out is not the uniqueness of the work, but, the story behind the project. “Light Invisible” is the artist’s first large-scale sculptural installation and was a difficult one to create. Due to the technical aspect of the work, Pashgian was unable to complete it in her studio and had to wait with everyone else to see the finished product on the day it was set up at LACMA.
Pashgian emerged in the art scene in the ’60s as a member of the Light and Space movement that originated in Southern California. Born in Pasadena, Calif., Pashgian studied art history before realizing she would rather take on the role of creator than student. This urged her to try a variety of media, such as oil paint, before she, along with several other SoCal artists, recognized that new industrial materials could also be used as a medium. Since then, the artist has worked with all kinds of materials, from fiberglass to polyester resins. Pashgian, fascinated by optical art, minimalism and geometric abstraction, emphasizes light play, perception and materials in her work. Though most artists understand the significance of lighting, only a few choose to manipulate light in their work the way Pashgian does in her LACMA exhibition. The artist creates a significant role for lighting — where the source of the light is what color the lights are. This can be seen in the 12 acrylic, translucent columns that stand 8 feet high.
“They’re elegant and austere, dramatic and sensual — and oddly nuanced, morphing as viewers move around them,” Deborah Vankin from the Los Angeles Times wrote of the columns.
Though these columns look incredibly simple from the outside, they are deceptively complex. They are filled with invisible clamps and glue to keep the structures in place so that they cast the light and shadows that Pashgian envisioned.
When you enter the room, however, it’s not the columns that you notice first, but the darkness. Everything is black, creating the illusion that these 12 acrylic pillars are hovering in zero gravity. The milky, diaphanous texture of the columns illuminates the varied shapes and colors inside and the visual experience is beautifully perplexing. Though it takes less than a minute to circle the installation, the quietness and  darkness force people to take time off to be mesmerized by Pashgian’s latest project.
According to the exhibit, Pashgian was unable to put her work together in the studio because so much of “Light Invisible” depended on the lighting and setting. This proved to be tough both for the artist and LACMA’s public relations team.
“One question, for example, is what photo or image we should use to represent the work of art in our advance publicity materials (such as our website, press release, and exhibition announcement), considering that it can’t be photographed until it is on view,” LACMA posted on its WordPress website.
“Light Invisible” is definitely an exhibition that speaks only to a certain group of people. It’s one of those moments that can make the viewer wonder: What is art? The concept behind “Light Invisible” is incredibly thoughtful and deep, but the display might be disappointing for those who expected more from Pashgian than a room full of columns.
Helen Pashgian’s “Light Invisible” exhibition opened on March 30 and will run until June 29 at LACMA. Admission to “Light Invisible” is included in the general admission ticket ($10 for students).

Pizza is a staple in a college student’s diet. Whether it’s for lunch or a 3 a.m. snack after a night out, you can never go wrong with a reliable slice of pie. Recently, however, there has been a surge in the consumption of burritos, particularly the kind that gives the foodie a choice as to what they would like in it. USC students need only walk down the street to get their customized burrito fix from Chipotle. But what if there was a way to mix the “do-it-yourself instantly” Chipotle method with good old-fashioned pizza?
Mamma Mia · PizzaRev gives customers the opportunity to create their own pizzas, at a nice location, with a friendly staff, at a low price. – Photo courtesy of South Bay Sparkle
PizzaRev is something you never knew you needed until you’ve actually experienced it — Domino’s or Pizza Hut will never look the same way again. It provides customers with all the ingredients they need to be pizza experts.
The Mid-City location celebrated its pre-opening on Monday and the most recent addition to its growing number of locations in Southern California. The restaurant is hidden at the top of a strip mall complex and if you weren’t explicitly looking for it or in the area already, it would be very easy to miss. The most winding journeys, however, reap the greatest rewards.
Before you order, you are given a brief overview of how PizzaRev works. They do offer a pre-selected menu of pizzas, but it is infinitely more fun to choose your own combination. In fact, the restaurant encourages you to be “weird” with your choices. You only live once. Go for it.
The customer starts out by choosing the crust, normal or gluten-free, and then chooses between four sauces (or they can throw them all in if they can’t decide). Then they decide on a type of cheese before sending the pizza down the assembly line to pile on the toppings. There are 11 kinds of meats and 16 other toppings the customer can choose from, and they have the privilege of piling on as many meats and toppings as the 10-inch base can handle. The toppings are rotated between seasons for optimal freshness and quality.
The pizzas are small enough for one person but also big enough to be comfortably shared between two people. The crust is thin, but strong enough to hold a good number of toppings, and it’s not so crunchy that you question if you’re actually eating a flat taco shell. If the customer wants to stray away from the original tomato sauce, PizzaRev also offers BBQ and white sauces. The white sauce gives the pizza a unique, stand-out taste that seems to get better with every bite. Once the customer is done creating his or her masterpiece, it is whisked into in an open fire-deck oven. In less than five minutes, there’s a freshly baked pizza brimming with the fresh ingredients of your choosing. Keep in mind, however, that orders might take longer if there are many customers.
It’s difficult to judge the tastiness of PizzaRev, given that there are endless combinations of ingredients and flavors the customer can utilize. Each pizza will be different as it is curated to each individual’s taste. One complaint about the eatery is the weakness of the jalapeños, resembling spiceless pickles rather than spicy peppers. But spice aficionados need not fear, for PizzaRev provides its customers a long shelf of hot sauces: Sriracha, Tabasco, Tapatio and many more.
This location is a perfect place to enjoy a meal with friends at any time of the day. It’s spacious with ample seating. Plus, the price can’t be beat: A pizza with unlimited toppings is only $8. This means you can pile a pizza with enough meat and veggies to substitute three meals for a low price. The quality of the food truly is beyond that price. The staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating and will recommend for their favorite combinations if you feel a little overwhelmed. The pizza is made directly in front of you, so  you will always be in control of what goes on it.
There are, however, a few negatives. The only crust option is thin, so deep-dish fans might not share the same enthusiasm. There’s is a possibility the vegetables might be slightly undercooked, or at least not as oven-roasted as you’d like, because even though the oven gets up to 800 degrees, the pizza is still in there for only three minutes. Though fresh, the toppings are pretty standard and it would be interesting to see the company branch out and offer more of a selection. Yet it does cater to a variety of dietary needs; whether you are vegan, vegetarian or gluten-free, you will find something to enjoy.
PizzaRev is as close to a handmade pizza as you will get, whether you have a kitchen or not. Its fax and online ordering options are convenient if you don’t have time to stand in line and wait for the pizza to be made. Overall, the quality is excellent and the taste of a pizza with gluten-free crust, white sauce, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, jalapenos, bell pepper, pineapple and low-fat mozzarella is utterly divine. PizzaRev truly is a pizza revolution.
 
PizzaRev is located at 4550 W Pico Blvd. The location is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Kessab, a largely Armenian-populated town in northwestern Syria, and its surrounding villages have been under cross-border attack the past week from Turkey via Al Qaeda-affiliated groups.
On Friday, March 21, the rebels crossed the Turkish border and attacked Kessab. A couple days later, on March 23, the extremist groups entered the town of Kessab, held hundreds of Armenian families hostage, destroyed three Armenian churches and took over Kessab and its surrounding villages.
Almost 700 Armenian families, who make up the majority of the population in Kessab, were evacuated by their community leaders to Latakia and Basit. Reports estimate that during the three-day assault, there were 80 civilian casualties and the town was ethnically cleansed of its Armenian population.
Under the leadership of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, it was initially reported that government forces drove out the rebels. Later it was revealed, however, that the rebels were moving toward Latakia, where many Armenians have fled to for protection.
For many Armenians around the world, the events in Kessab are a reminder of what happened almost 100 years ago.
On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Turk authorities began arresting and murdering Armenian intellectuals and community leaders, which would mark the defining day of what would become known as the Armenian Genocide.
Following the round-up of leaders, the Ottoman military forced Armenians from their homes, raped women and children and forced the refugees into death marches for hundreds of miles while depriving them of food and water. By the end of the genocide, approximately 1.5 million Armenians had been massacred.
For many months preceding the attacks on Kessab, the Armenian National Committee-International warned the international community of impending threat from extremist foreign fighters against the Christian Armenian population in Syria.
The Armenian National Committee-International said, “In the last one hundred years, this is the third time that the Armenians are being forced to leave Kessab and in all three cases, Turkey is the aggressor or on the side of the aggressors.”
Currently, 21 countries, not including Turkey or the United States, have recognized the systematic murders of the Armenian people from 1915-1923 as the first genocide of the 20th century. The Armenian diaspora unites every year to commemorate the genocide of the Armenian people by the Turkish government and seeks to have it reaffirmed by the United States and Turkey.
This year, especially in the wake of the atrocities in Kessab, the Armenian diaspora has united stronger than ever. On Friday, March 28, hundreds of Armenians protested outside of the Turkish Consulate on Wilshire Boulevard. Simultaneously, Armenians joined forces over social media outlets using the hashtag #SaveKessab to spread awareness. The movement reached celebrities, including Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, The Game and Travis Barker, as they tweeted and posted Instagram pictures expressing their support to end the violence in Kessab.
It’s time for people across the world to recognize and respond to the brutality of the evil forces and all crimes against humanity, including Turkey against the Christian Armenians in Kessab.
To join the movement and reach the U.S. government, tweet, post a Facebook status or an Instagram picture and get #SaveKessab trending so we can make a difference and help the families of Kessab return home to their peaceful lives.

Nerses,
Your article reminds me Sam Huntington’s book “The Bloody Borders of Islam”.
It’s interesting to note that the 20th centuries first genocide – the Armenian mass slaughter by Muslims – and its last genocide (that against the Sudanese people) were both committed by Muslims against “infidels”.
A coincident?  I don’t think so.

Before you read this column, I should tack on a giant spoiler alert warning. Whether you’re a good student waiting to watch your favorite show until after midterm season or, if you’re like me, and throw caution to the wind with too many shows to watch in one sitting, none of us like spoilers. They ruin the surprise of any plot twist, especially when it comes to what seems like television’s ever-recurring trend — killing off a beloved character. So, once again, spoiler alert.
Design by Mollie Berg
A shocking death happened on last week’s episode of The Good Wife, a serial political and legal drama about the first lady of Illinois, Alicia Florrick, who is tired of her domestic role. At the epicenter of the show is the relationship between Alicia and her lawyer colleague, Will Gardner. Gardner, sadly, was caught in the middle of a courtroom shooting, shocking viewers and demolishing any chances of the protagonists getting together. Critics were divided about the validity of this killing. Some praised the show for taking risks with the new direction, while others predicted an inability to recover from such a startling storyline.
I am no stranger to my favorite characters being killed off of shows — flashback to a couple years ago when Lexie Grey was killed off of Grey’s Anatomy. When that happened, I went through the seven stages of denial, swearing off the show because of emotional trauma. It was mirrored this past year by the season finale of Homeland, in which lead character Nicholas Brody was hanged for foreign war crimes. Two weeks ago, Scandal saw James Novak shot for trying to expose the government. However essential television writers might consider the death of a character, it is sometimes detrimental and unnecessary for plot development.
I do acknowledge the practical purposes for the demise of characters on television shows. Perhaps the actor who plays the character unfortunately died in real life, such as when Glee writers killed off the character Finn Hudson following the death of actor Cory Monteith last July. When something as tragic as that happens, it’s respectable to pay homage to the actor for what he or she contributed to the show. I also can’t go on without addressing how the actor Josh Charles, who plays Will Gardner, wanted to leave the show after last season but was persuaded by his co-star Julianna Margulies, who plays Alicia, to go on for more episodes this season. His character being written off is pragmatic on the one hand, but on the other, when an established show that has lost its hype tries to zest up its storylines with the death of a character, it’s less than admirable. To me, it seems like a cop-out.
To add depth to a show by manipulating a character’s shelf life is to cut off any possibility of future developments for that specific character. It can be very simple deciding to end a character’s life, calculating the best way to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. It’s another thing to ask questions about how the roles can expand. In the case of The Good Wife, I would have been curious to see more of Gardner’s character, both in his personal life and as a ruthless lawyer. In his television death, the show is now limited in that it can no longer elaborate upon his life, leaving the writers one less avenue for connections with the viewers.
Additionally, the show can now use Will’s death to develop other characters, which to me does nothing to further advance the series. Rather, it flatlines the show into a formula. I loved The Good Wife because of how each character had a big enough presence to carry him or herself within his or her own work spheres. With Will’s death, there will be an inevitable web of how the characters get past this incident, a process to which he will ultimately be forgotten. This television algorithm was seen in Grey’s Anatomy and will undoubtedly be prevalent in Homeland and Scandal in upcoming seasons.
In my ideal world, Will Gardner lives on, litigating as the perfect counterpart to Alicia Florrick. Perhaps with the recent thread of television deaths, it will challenge writers and television show producers to be more innovative. An unexhausted and completely new plot twist is hopefully in the works somewhere.

Riding on a flood of controversy, Darren Aronofsky’s reinterpretation of the story of Noah and the Ark won the weekend with a strong $43.72M. While it was nothing compared to the controversy of The Passion of the Christ ten years ago, the intrigue of seeing this Biblical tale adapted for the big screen was enough to bring the devout and the curious in strong numbers.
Noah, starring Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Anthony Hopkins and Emma Watson, became a much-debated approach to the material incorporated some of the more fantastical elements from the Bible and from the apocryphal texts, which aren’t as familiar to non-religious audiences. It also addressed the moral ambiguity of Noah himself.
To compensate for the potentially polarizing details, such as the portrayal of the angels more akin to the monstrous descriptions in the Old Testament and the interpretation of Noah as a survivalist eco-extremist, 20th Century Fox has marketed the film as a disaster epic, teasing some of the elaborate visuals of literal Biblical proportions. Noah is frequently shown as a gritty powerful figure in trailers, reminiscent of Russell Crowe’s roles in Gladiator and Robin Hood.
The response from American audiences were very mixed though, with many surprised at the deviations from the source material and the incorporation of many esoteric details from the rabbinical texts. While that may lead to weaker legs domestically, its international potential is huge. Disaster epics play strongly overseas and the story of Noah is universally known across multiple cultures and creeds – nearly every major religion has some version of the flood story.
But Noah can’t quite claim dominance, as other films did just fine in their own right. Divergent fell 51 percent to $25.62M, which was a better drop than both the first Twilight and the first Hunger Games movies. Muppets Most Wanted was able to save some face from its weak opening with a 33.1 percent drop to $11.28M and Mr. Peabody & Sherman continues to play well with family audiences with a $9.07M.
The smallest drop, though, belonged to the Christian-geared God’s Not Dead, which fell just 4.5 percent to $8.8M for the weekend. Maybe some Christians, turned off by the changes in Noah, instead went to see this film.
One film did bomb this weekend, though. Sabotage, the David Ayer-directed DEA action thriller, which only mustered $5.27M. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and an ensemble including Sam Worthington, Malin Akerman, Joe Manganiello and Terrence Howard, this marks the third straight bomb for Arnold (last year’s The Last Stand and Escape Plan both flopped, grossing only $25.13M and $12.05M, respectively). While the former governor of California remains a lovable public figure, this may prove once and for all that modern audiences just aren’t interested in seeing him lead an action film anymore.
Further down the list was Cesar Chavez, starring Michael Peña as the Mexican-American civil rights activist, which managed a disappointing $2.86M in 664 theaters. Lionsgate had marketed the film directly to Mexican-American audiences, who, despite comprising of nearly 33 percent of all moviegoers, are barely represented in the majority of films. In fact, Cesar Chavez will be the only film from a major studio this year that features a Hispanic actor in the lead role. However, this may have been a case where the studio failed to market it to anyone else, so there was little fanfare outside of its core audience.

On Friday at Alumni Park, The Special Events Committee in collaboration with Zeta Phi Rho fraternity made 17,341 sandwiches and beat the Guinness World Record of most sandwiches made in an hour.
At least 20 different teams from varying organizations competed to make the most sandwiches and win the $500 gift card award.  The meals were donated to Union Rescue Mission, Midnight Mission, and others to feed the homeless on Skid Row.
“One of the main goals other than making sandwiches was to make sure we could mobilize college students to do something good for the community and give them a reason to,” said Vincent Ong, a junior majoring in cognitive sciences and president of Zeta Phi Rho said.  “That’s why we implemented the prizes.  People like competition and gifts so we made the whole thing more interesting with the help of USC SEC.”
As SEC ’s mission is to push traditional boundaries and create memorable experiences for students, the committee thought attempting a world record could accomplish both.
“We decided on making sandwiches because one: the impact on the community and two: the feasibility of it,” said Director of Special Events Committee Kim Chu.  “We had already started planning our event, and Zeta Phi Rho was planning their annual Zeta Phi “Skid” Rho event, back to back actually.  We contacted them to work together because we both have the same mission, and why not combine forces of their expertise in making sandwiches — as they have done this for years — and our expertise in planning large scale events?”
Students from other campuses came as well to participate in this event.
“I’ve seen YouTube videos of this in the past and wanted to come out and support but there was conflict of schedule,” said Bryant Voong, junior majoring in math and science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “But being spring break [for him], it was the perfect opportunity to show face and help out.  I thought the amount of people who came out was crazy and I thoroughly enjoyed making sandwiches.”
Evelyn Liu, a junior majoring in biological sciences and communications, noted at one point sandwich supplies ran low and thus encouraged student collaboration.
“Before the hour was up, we started to use up all the ingredients and at that point we started sharing ingredients with the other tables, ” said Evelyn Liu, a junior majoring in biological sciences and communications said.  “Our goal at first was to beat the other teams, but with the short supply, we helped each other out to make sure the world record was broken.  Our focus became more of the bigger picture.”
In the end, Chu noted that the event turned out to be quite the success. With over 17,00 sandwiches were made, the students came in three times greater than the previous record.
“I think the event went very well as there was an overwhelming number of participants,” said Kim Chu, a senior majoring in business administration and director of SEC said.  “In previous years, Zeta Phi Rho has gotten about 100 people and we had just hoped to double that number — but there were over 400 today.”
Well, if the interns and resumes weren’t impressive…there’s always Subways :)
