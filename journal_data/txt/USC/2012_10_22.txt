A 22-year-old man will serve a 25-year prison term for shooting a USC student in the chest at a party in September 2011, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.
Tyson Tyree Smith was sentenced Monday after pleading no contest to one count of attempted murder and admitting to using a firearm.
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Patricia Schnegg dismissed a second attempted murder charge and two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, according to the statement.
Officials said the shooting took place at about 1 a.m. on the first story of a two-floor apartment on the 1200 block of West 37th Place. The shooting occurred on Sept. 4, 2011. Smith has stayed in custody since he was charged Sept. 15, 2011.
Smith fired one round and hit two students, both of whom survived. The bullet first hit a female student in the hand before hitting a male student in the chest.

Writer Jen Kennedy and artist Liz Linden led a discussion Monday on topics ranging from Congressman Todd Akin to the differences between The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, but all discussions revolved around the central theme of the portrayal of women in the news.

Monday’s New York Times Feminist Reading Group — the first of four discussions about events relating to feminism as reported by The New York Times — took place in the Forum at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Kennedy and Linden attended the Whitney Independent Study Program together from 2008-09 and have since collaborated on multiple projects that explore feminism.  Their work has been showcased at multiple museums, including the Whitney Museum of American Art and the New Museum.
Participants analyzed how women are depicted in the newspaper through a discussion of all the photos that showed women, such as one of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney where the only women in the photo are taking pictures of him. The event also discussed the photos that did not show women, as well as the news articles accompanying the photos.
Kennedy started the event with commentary on the word “feminism” itself.
“It’s important to have these sort of shorthand for communication … we need a kind of concise, accurate shorthand to communicate a set of ideas,” Kennedy said. “[Feminism] doesn’t mean everything we want it to at all moments.”
The pair has previously led New York Times readings, but typically at museums with other artists.
“Here you get people who are studying journalism, or work in social sciences or whatever,” Linden said about holding the event at USC. “There’s a really wide range of interests and, as a result, the comments are a bit more diverse.”
Kennedy and Linden were originally contacted by the former dean of the Roski School of Fine Arts, Rochelle Steiner, to come to USC as part of the Visions and Voices initiative. The dean of each school is required to put together an event for the program.
Kate Strand, special events coordinator for Roski helped organize the event and said one thing she found interesting was “how feminism can tie into stories about art.”
Pardes Seleh, a student taking a psychology course at the Los Angeles Trade Technical College, originally came to earn extra credit for her course, but said she ended up learning more from the event.
“It’s nice to be in a room with people and get to see … why people think the way they do,” Seleh said.
The series will continue Tuesday through Thursday from 4:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. in the Forum Room on the fourth floor of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.

After the discontinuation of the shuttle that ran from USC to LA Live, the University Residential Student Community Advocacy Board is petitioning LA Live owner Anschutz Entertainment Group to reinstate the shuttle, arguing that it would be beneficial for USC students and business at LA Live.
The URSC Advocacy Board, a branch of the University Residential Student Community that is dedicated to improving life at USC by supporting new ideas and campaigning for change, created a survey for students to prove that they would use the free shuttle, if it were reinstated.
USC Transportation Director Tony Mazza said the university discontinued the shuttle after AEG ceased its funding, believing that the newly constructed Expo Rail would replace it.
AEG could not be reached for comment.
Rick Yang, a member of the Advocacy Board who is promoting the survey, said this is not the case. Yang argued that the rail is not a good alternative to the shuttle because it is much less convenient, and students overall prefer the shuttle.
In the more than 750 responses gathered by the survey, an overwhelming 95 percent of students said that they want the shuttle back, some even requesting that the shuttle’s running time be extended until 3 a.m.
According to Yang, the survey results demonstrate that students see a need for the shuttle.
“The survey results are pretty clear that students want the shuttle back,” Yang said. “One of the questions on our survey was: How often would you go to LA Live if they brought back the shuttle? The results showed that a majority of students said if the shuttle was available, they would go one to three times a month.”
Liz Friedman, a freshman majoring in global business, agreed that students would be more inclined to visit LA Live if free shuttle service was available.
“Because I don’t have a car at school, it’s really hard to get off campus to go out to eat or to the movies,” Friedman said. “I wish they hadn’t taken the shuttle away this year, because I definitely would use it to go over there with my friends once in a while.
Mazza explained that USC cannot fund the shuttle on its own, but brought up multiple alternatives to the shuttle.
“Currently, our budget in Transportation cannot support the cost of continuing the shuttle,” Mazza said. “However, the campus community can use the Expo Rail, DASH, Zipcars, carpools with other students, or their personal vehicles to visit LA Live.”
Regardless of some of the negative feedback, Yang and the URSC Advocacy Board are determined to do as much as they can to ensure the shuttle’s reinstatement.
“We’re hoping that the survey will convince the officials who run LA Live that USC students would appreciate bringing back the shuttle,” Yang said. “It’d be mutually beneficial — they would make money from ’SC students, and we’d have a more direct path to the area.”
The Expo Line stops in nearly the same places the shuttle did… maybe a block away. Take the Expo, it runs until 2 am on Friday/Satuday nights… and, while you’re at it go another stop to 7th Street where you can connect to the rest of the Metro system and see all of LA.
When I was in school just a few years ago we all wanted a shuttle to go to the 7th Street Metro Center… then we could get to Hollywood, Pasadena, Mid-City from there. The LA LIVE shuttle was GREAT, but didn’t quite get us all the way. Now that the Expo Line is open, it does what the shuttle did, and much much more!
I bet more people would use it if they made it look like a real space shuttle.   Obviously a downsized version that doesn’t require any trees to be cut
“However, the campus community can use the Expo Rail, DASH, Zipcars, carpools with other students, or their personal vehicles to visit LA Live.”
Also they can walk. Y’know, like with your feet. It’s less than a 30 minute walk from The Row and then parking is free!
Um, there is ZERO need for a private shuttle to LA Live with the Expo line running until 2AM on weekends. Are you kidding me??? WTF

With only 15 days left until election day, students crowded into the Annenberg East Lobby to watch President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney have a final showdown in the live presidential debate Monday night at an event hosted by the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and sponsored by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
The debate, broadcasted live from Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., was moderated by CBS Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer.
With most polls showing the two presidential candidates in a close race for the White House, this debate was one of the last opportunities for both candidates to sway voters before they head to the voting booths in two short weeks. Following last week’s combative dialogue between the two presidential candidates, voters anxiously awaited to see if the momentum would carry to Florida.
The opening question of the debate focused on the attack of the American consulate in Libya. According to  Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, America needs to have a strategic plan to combat this type of extremism.
“We can’t kill our way out of this mess,” Romney said. “We’re going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy.”
The president fired back against Romney’s allegations against his foreign policy.
“I know you haven’t been in a position to actually execute foreign policy,” Obama said. “But every time you’ve offered an opinion, you’ve been wrong. You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.”
Both candidates agreed on the importance of investing in our relationships with our allies in the Middle East, namely Israel.
“Everything we’re doing, we are doing with our partners in the region, including Israel.” Obama said.
Though Romney agreed that the United States must unite with its allies, he highlighted the importance of emphasizing American leadership in the region.
“Seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us,” Romney said. “We should be playing the leadership role there.”
Romney pivoted the discussion from foreign policy to the economy, highlighting the importance of American strength at home in order to be strong overseas.
“For us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong,” Romney said. “And that requires for us to have a strong economy at home.”
President Obama countered Romney’s allegation, instead highlighting America’s increased strength since he has taken office.
“America remains the one indispensable nation,” Obama said. “And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office.”
Obama turned the conversation to education, highlighting the importance of investing in education to strengthen America and criticizing the governor’s lack of support for increased funding.
“The kinds of budget proposals that you’ve put forward, when we don’t ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for eduction, that’s undermining our long-term competitiveness,” Obama said.
In closing, both candidates emphasized the choice voters will face in the election.
“I’ve got a different vision for America. I want to build on our strengths,” Obama said.
Romney recognized that the election is a choice too,  except he focused on the notion of being a leader.
“We need strong leadership,” Romney said. “I’d like to be that leader, with your support.”
The panel, which was co-moderated by Matt Rodriguez, the former Western States regional director for the Obama for America campaign in 2008, and Jonathan Wilcox, a former speechwriter for then-California Gov. Pete Wilson, posed questions to the audience about the debate. By a show of hands, a slight majority of the audience appeared to believe Obama won the final debate.
Jared Ginsburg, a member of USC College Republicans, noted that the president’s strategy was on the offensive.
“Romney was more conciliatory,” Ginsburg said. “Obama was clearly on the attack tonight.”
Sydney Fishman, a member of USC College Democrats, thought there was no clear winner as there were in the two previous debates.
“I personally don’t feel like there was a really clear winner in this debate like there was in the other two,” Fishman said. “I don’t see that much of a change in the polls happening.”
Looking forward, the panelists agreed that the remainder of the election will continue to be a close race.
“I think that Ohio is going to be a very decisive factor,” Ginsburg said. “Governor Romney certainly performed really well tonight, so I think this will remain dangerously close during the next 14 days.”

You heard the jokes after USC’s Sept. 22 game against California. You heard the same jokes after subsequent road trips to Utah and Washington.
USC coach Lane Kiffin’s offense was slow and stagnant. The space shuttle Endeavour trotted around Exposition Park at a quicker pace, they teased.
So of course the No. 9 Trojans’ 44-point rout of Colorado last Saturday looked all the more impressive. They scored, they scored often and they scored quickly. On the game’s third play, they scored on a 55-yard touchdown toss from senior quarterback Matt Barkley to sophomore wideout Marqise Lee. And by 9:03 in the first quarter, the scoreboard read USC 19, Colorado 0, a beatdown so decisive that many fans seemingly filed for the exits at the same time late-arriving Angelenos first plopped into their seats.
Everyone witnessed Kiffin’s bunch at full speed. At last, the offense played fast. About time, huh?
“The no-huddle was effective, I think,” said Lee, carrying his usual wide grin after catching six passes for 103 yards and a touchdown.
The second-year receiver stood in the tunnel outside the home locker room at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and acknowledged he wasn’t overly concerned with what pace they played at, so long as they won. And oh, did they win Saturday.
But he also added: “It was like going back to our old selves.”
Yep, if you hadn’t noticed, USC installed a no-huddle offense against the Buffaloes and it worked quite nicely. So don’t be taken aback or confused — you needn’t think back to the grind-it-out style from earlier this season, the 27-9 win over Cal. Let’s be clear, this is this team’s identity: Speed. Up-tempo. Vertical passing.
Well, this is what the team’s identity should be at least. This is the Trojans’ calling card. It might not look like your father’s USC team, essentially making a 180-degree turn from the years of Tailback U, but it’s how it’ll be best off moving forward in 2012. It’s the personnel, stupid.
Part of Saturday’s success is naturally because of the opponent — Colorado, after all, is 1-6 overall and has struggled to acclimate to the Pac-12 since leaving the Big 12 in 2011. Nevertheless, much like in their season finale against UCLA a season ago, Barkley, Lee and the rest of the offense looked fluid — like the reigns were taken off, so to speak.
The no-huddle tempo appeared all too natural.
“It’s something we’ve practiced throughout the year, just waiting for the right time,” Kiffin said. “It went with the emphasis of attacking.”
Now might be a good time to trot it out once again, to keep attacking. The road ahead only becomes more formidable.
Next up for the Trojans: Arizona and No. 4 Oregon. Combined, they’re 11-3 this season. The Ducks are undefeated and the Wildcats aren’t too shabby either, finishing with 52 points in their last outing — a win over Washington in Tucson, Ariz. Both coaches are highly regarded offensive innovators, as well: Rich Rodriguez at Arizona and Chip Kelly at Oregon — well-known for their work with the spread offense.
The overwhelming sentiment for weeks has been one of caution, with fears that facing the so-called “spread teams” would be a major stumbling block for USC, that it would be a contrast of styles. But that’s an old, outdated mindset. This is here and this is now, and whether Kiffin, among others, cares to admit it or not, USC is much more like Arizona and Oregon than Stanford.
The Trojans, much like their green-and-gold-clad rivals to the north, need to play in that hurried fashion.
“That’s our favorite, because, you know, we like to play fast all the time,” said sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard, who will be lining up against those Arizona and Oregon offenses. “We don’t like the TV timeouts. We like the movement.”
The reasons are simple and twofold, really.
On offense, USC’s skilled players are also the team’s most decorated. On defense, its top playmakers are perhaps undersized (such as in the case of 6-foot, 210-pound sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey) but big enough and more than quick enough to stop offenses.
So play fast. If USC’s horses are skilled position guys, it might be appropriate to, you know, ride those horses.
“We have a lot of great receivers out there, and a lot of teams get tired,” Lee said. “So we’ll probably keep that in, depending on what Kiffin wants to do.”
Makes sense enough.

The climb continues for USC.
Following last Saturday’s 50-6 win over Colorado at the Coliseum, the Trojans rank No. 9 in this week’s BCS standings after debuting at No. 10. And so the question becomes what the Trojans need to do in order to climb up in the polls to secure the No. 1 or No. 2 spot in the season’s final BCS rankings and earn a coveted spot in the national championship game, scheduled for Jan. 7 at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.
At the moment, USC is ranked No. 8 in the USA Today coaches’ poll and No. 9 in the Harris Interactive Poll — two polling systems that compose two-thirds of the BCS formula. Both have enabled USC to safely secure a spot in the top 10.
But where the team has the most ground to make up comes with the computer rankings, where its overall average stands at .370, good for 16th nationally.
Six computer systems are used by the BCS: Anderson & Hester, Richard Billingsley, Colley Matrix, Kenneth Massey, Jeff Sagarin and Peter Wolfe. And in the six ratings, USC is ranked No. 16, No. 8, No. 17, No. 19, No. 15 and No. 19, respectively.
To calculate a team’s computer poll average, the highest and lowest rankings are removed and the four remaining scores are averaged, totaled and calculated as a percentage, as outlined on the BCS’s official website.
The reason the Trojans hover around 15 in the computers, roughly seven spots lower than in the polls: strength of schedule, which is factored into each of the ratings systems.
Thus far, the Trojans have yet to beat a team with a winning record — their six wins have come against opponents with a combined record of 13-29. Two of the six wins have come against one-win teams, Hawai’i and Colorado. And USC’s best win came against a 3-4 Washington team.
But USC (6-1, 4-1) should have the chance to move up in the coming weeks, and remains positioned rather well. Its remaining five opponents, Arizona, Oregon, Arizona State, UCLA and Notre Dame, are a combined 28-7. And both the Ducks and Fighting Irish, ranked No. 4 and No. 5, respectively, come to South Los Angeles next month, giving USC the chance to move past them in the rankings.
Moreover, three SEC teams are ranked ahead of USC, and so is Pac-12 foe Oregon State, which is not on the Trojans’ regular-season schedule. Alabama, ranked No. 1, still must face No. 6 LSU. And the Crimson Tide is currently slotted to play Florida in the SEC championship game, where one team will lose.
As for the No. 7 Beavers, they are still set to play Oregon in the Civil War on Nov. 24, and possibly a Pac-12 championship game on Nov. 30 against USC, either at the Coliseum or in Corvallis, Ore.

Much of Sunday’s conference call with USC coach Lane Kiffin went beyond the Trojans’ record-breaking offensive performances against Colorado, instead gravitating toward the question of why USC continues to incur double-digit penalties in most games. Against Colorado, USC committed 10 penalties for 90 yards, although, surprisingly, none were of the false start or delay-of-game variety.
In limbo · Freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams, pictured here on Oct. 13 at Washington, awaits word from the Pac-12 on whether he will be suspended for Saturday’s game. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The Trojans’ play in the first half was so undisciplined, in fact, that Kiffin gathered his players on the sideline at the end of the half to scold them before they could retreat into the locker room.
“I don’t really have a theory on it,” Kiffin said when asked why USC is ranked last in the Football Bowl Subdivision in penalties per game. “It’s obviously really disappointing.”
The coaching staff’s disappointment spilled over into its halftime locker room discussions, as Kiffin’s staff reprimanded the team for its senseless penalties, especially the personal fouls. Redshirt freshman linebacker Anthony Sarao and freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams both committed personal fouls, and sophomore defensive tackle George Uko earned an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in the first half.
“I’ve never spent a halftime like that before, where the entire halftime was on penalties and composure with the guys,” Kiffin said. “I’m hoping we hit rock-bottom in the first half. When we have the personal fouls like we have, that’s a disgrace to our university, to all of our great players that have played here before.”
Moving forward, Kiffin has implored USC’s captains — seniors Matt Barkley, Khaled Holmes and T.J. McDonald and junior Nickell Robey — to take ownership of the problem and communicate the importance of playing with a level head.
As for Williams’ personal foul penalty that drew an ejection, Kiffin hopes Williams, whom he has repeatedly praised as the rare true freshman to emerge as an impact player, can learn from his momentary lapse in judgment. After the game, several teammates claimed that a Colorado offensive lineman spat on Williams underneath a pile of players,  prompting his punch.
“He’s a true freshman, and he made a mistake,” Kiffin said. “He apologized for it to the team afterwards. He’ll learn from it and grow from it.”
Kiffin expected to hear from the Pac-12 on Monday whether Williams would earn a suspension for Saturday’s game at Arizona, but there was no official release as of late Monday night.
—
Sophomore offensive tackle Aundrey Walker left midway through the third quarter on a medical cart with an apparent neck injury. After the game, Walker was notably absent from the locker room and reportedly spent the night in a hospital.
Because of health privacy laws, Kiffin was unable to expand much on Walker’s condition, but did state that Walker attended Sunday’s team meeting and that “things seem to be very positive.”
Initially splitting snaps with Walker before filling in for the rest of the game, freshman Max Tuerk once again drew Kiffin’s praise for his stout play.
—
In addition to USC’s headliners, several younger players and veteran backups recorded significant personal milestones.
Junior wide receiver De’Von Fluornoy, in his fourth year with the program, recorded his first career reception, as did freshman tight end Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick.
Kiffin said that USC players “cheered when [Fluornoy’s] catch came up” while they were reviewing game film.
Other offensive players who experienced breakthroughs were redshirt freshman quarterback Max Wittek and sophomore running back D.J. Morgan who connected on a 24-yard pass for the first career touchdown for both players.
Defensively, the team’s three interceptions came from unlikely sources. Senior safety Drew McAllister registered his first interception since 2008, and junior safety Gerald Bowman and senior linebacker Tony Burnett snared their first career interceptions.
“There were some good stories from that game of non-starters,” Kiffin said. “Their starters were in for the most part late, and [our] backups and young guys performed well.”

The Trojans are ranked No. 9 in the latest BCS standings released on Sunday. The Trojans moved up one spot from No. 10 following South Carolina’s 44-11 defeat against the Florida Gators. USC, meanwhile, earned an impressive 50-6 victory over the Pac-12’s last place team, the Colorado Buffaloes.
Two Oregon teams still rank ahead of the Trojans in the standings. The Ducks are in the No. 4 spot, one lower than last week after being leapfrogged by a Kansas State squad that blew out West Virginia, and the Oregon State Beavers remain at No. 7 following their defeat of the Utah Utes, 21-7.
No 17. Stanford, meanwhile, is the fourth Pac-12 team in the BCS standings. They are the second highest rated team with two losses.
In the Associated Press poll, USC also moved up one spot from No. 11 to No. 10. They are No. 8 in the USA Today coaches’ poll, one spot ahead of the undefeated Oregon State Beavers.
The Trojans will have a chance over the coming weeks to improve their standing in the polls, with games against two highly ranked teams—No. 4 Oregon and No. 5 Notre Dame—along with matchups against teams that received votes in the latest AP poll and USA Today coaches’ poll. Those teams are Arizona, Arizona State and UCLA. Both the Arizona and UCLA games will be on the road.

Point: Elena Kadvany
There weren’t many surprises in tonight’s presidential debate. Moderator Bob Schieffer asked the expected questions about Libya, Syria, Egypt, Iran, Afghanistan and China. As always, there were many important topics left undebated — Greece, the Eurocrisis, Mexico’s drug war. The candidates were pretty civilized, nitpicking on some claims but also agreeing on others.
Tonight’s debate wasn’t nearly as exciting as last week’s, but it did reaffirm some fundamental differences between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney that we must consider, now more than ever, with renewed awareness.
One of the most glaring divides between Obama and Romney was actually illustrated by tonight’s now-trending quote: Obama’s “horses and bayonets” zinger. In response to Romney’s plan for Navy expansion, Obama said, “You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military’s changed.”
The phrase might have been instantaneously turned into a comedic Twitter handle, Tumblr and meme — but it says something really important about Romney: His views on military spending, as well as his foreign and social policies, are rooted in the past. Obama also pointedly made this charge: “Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s … just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.”
Romney likes to emphasize that voting for Obama means voting for another four years of the same policy that has gotten the nation into its current messes. But voting for Romney means voting for a return to past policies that are not in touch with what America needs in the here and now. This includes modestly cutting military spending, not increasing it. This includes asking wealthy Americans to contribute a little more so that the middle class is not as burdened and the country can make some key investments in energy, education and jobs. This includes working to support the Middle East not just governmentally and militarily, but also educationally in order to secure Afghan independence by 2014. These are all plans that Obama has put forth, not Romney.
But it’s now in the voters’ hands. The debate might not have swayed you from an already existing opinion, but it should serve as more food for thought. Obama has made his fair share of mistakes and failed promises, but he’s committed to policies of the present and future, not the past. Isn’t that the kind of president we want?
___________
Counterpoint: Sarah Cueva
President Barack Obama came out strong in the third and final debate of this election cycle, but this time so did Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Both candidates presented their views on issues of foreign policy with consistency and conviction, with Obama mainly defending his foreign policy of the past four years and Romney committing to what amounted to a more strong-armed approach to the issues.
Despite Romney’s essentially nonexistent foreign policy credentials, he held his own against the current commander-in-chief. When accused by Obama of flip-flopping on his view of the greatest threat to the U.S. being Russia, Romney countered with an assertion that Russia was the greatest geopolitical threat while Iran was the greatest national security threat. Such exchanges showed Romney capable of standing by a consistent foreign policy.
One area of relative inconsistency was the issue of military spending. Romney adamantly stuck to his commitment to maintain current levels of defense spending, refusing to buckle under accusations of hypocrisy from Obama. Though this has always been a part of Romney’s platform, his unwavering vow to maintain what many deem to be an unsustainable defense budget undercuts his pledge to close the budget deficit.
Other than this, Obama and Romney’s exchanges did not reveal many significant differences between their approaches to issues abroad. Both candidates discussed the need for troop withdrawal from Afghanistan by 2014 and cited military intervention in Syria and Iran as absolute last resorts.
However, Obama came across as somewhat more conciliatory where Romney came across as firm, if not quite heavy-handed. Romney said that he would not only continue the economic sanctions placed on Iran by the Obama administration, but that he would tighten the already crippling sanctions in addition to employing diplomatic isolation.
Romney’s obvious intensity when it came to the questions of a nuclear Iran and war with Israel stood in contrast with Obama’s less committal approach to the issues, arguably demonstrating Romney as the winner of tonight’s debate.
Regardless of citizens’ views of the issues discussed tonight, Romney presented himself as more impassioned — even if obnoxious in his insistence that he get more time to talk — than Obama. Romney’s performance tonight showed a new side of the candidate, portraying him as more committed to his views and capable of defending them than in previous debate appearances. Let’s hope that he maintains this trajectory in the last few weeks leading up to Election Day.

	The Daily Trojan’s Editorial Director, Elena Kadvany, and opinion columnist Sarah Cueva will be live blogging the third presidential debate from 6 to 7:30 p.m. Elena will take a more liberal perspective, and Sarah a conservative one. Check the DT website and Twitter (@dailytrojan) for live updates!
6:08
	SC: Moderator Bob Schaiffer starts off the debate with a question on Libya. Romney veers away from the question and suggests a Romney administration would enact a new “comprehensive strategy” in the Middle East to prevent further violence and nuclear proliferation. I have to say, not too many specifics there.
6:09
	EK: First question of the night: the Middle East. Among his usual talking points, Romney says, “We can’t kill our way out of this mess.” and that we need a “comprehensive strategy” moving forward. Obama speaks to specific accomplishments he’s made and a specific strategy for moving forward that is designed to keep Americans safe at the same time as promoting Afghan independence.
6:10
	EK: Romney’s Middle East policy is about getting the bad guys? Not sounding too presidential.
6:12
	EK: Obama says Romney’s foreign policies are from the 1980s, his social policies from the 1950s and his economic policies from the 1920s. 
6:14
	SC: Romney corrects Obama’s allegation that he has been inconsistent on his foreign policy stances, asserting that he did say that Russia is our biggest geopolitical threat, which is different from Iran, which he calls our greatest national security threat.
6:16
	EK: Obama says we need to remember the entire Middle Eastern population and help to protect religious minorities and women. I’d like to hear more on that.
6:20
	EK: On Syria, Romney says America should be playing the leadership role. Spot on, but Obama says we already are.
6:21
	SC: On Syria, Romney makes a good point in saying that we need to not only focus on deposing Assad but also ensure that we build and maintain good relations with the governing coalition that replaces him.
6:23
	SC: Obama defends US military intervention in Libya while also saying that we should not take military initiative in Syria. Interesting inconsistency.
6:26
	EK: Obama draws a great connection between youth in Egypt and American youth — they want jobs, they want better prospects for the future. Have to help to provide education for young people there.
6:29
	SC: Romney says that to promote stable governance abroad, we have to have the same thing here as an example. Our national debt is a major hindrance to that, and the past four years has not done much to pull us out of this deep financial hole.
6:35
	EK: Romney says we’re headed down an economic road toward Greece? A bit of an exaggeration.
6:37
	EK: Obama brings up education in a foreign policy debate? Off topic, seems a bit like he’s making plugs he hasn’t had the time for before. Nonetheless, education policy deserves more visibility in this election and Obama is relentlessly giving it that.
6:37
	EK: Romney on education: He offers his Massachusetts track record, again.
6:38
	SC: Romney responds to Obama’s claim that he has promoted “wrong and reckless policy” by laying out a five-point plan as to how to get our economy back on track. His emphasis on energy independence for North America is especially important in this and in reducing foreign entanglements.
6:42
	SC: Romney’s commitment to maintain current levels of military funding/defense spending is incompatible with his promise to close the deficit. A little malleability could help Romney’s case here. Defense spending at its current level is simply unsustainable.
6:51
	SC: Romney advocates tightening economic sanctions on Iran and imposing diplomatic isolation, while maintaining that military action is the absolute last resort. Otherwise, his policy on preventing the development of a nuclear Iran does not sound all too different from Obama’s.
6:54
	EK: Both candidates coming out strong on Iran.
6:59
	SC: Romney says that we are “four years closer” to a nuclear Iran. Aside from military action, it’s unclear how a Romney administration would reverse Iranian advancement in nuclear development.
7:00
	EK: When Obama was candidate and went to Israel, he visited Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum. When Romney went, he held a fundraiser that was closed to the press.
7:03
	EK: Obama says Romney has been all over the map on his policies and beliefs. Trite talking point but true.
7:11
	SC: Romney emphasizes the need to maintain good relations with Pakistan and ensure that it does not deteriorate into a failed state. Fair enough, but what does this entail? Would it just be the next Iraq?
7:14
	EK: It’s really interesting how many times Obama has tied conflict in Middle East to women.
7:22
	SC: Romney says that he would designate China as a currency manipulator on day 1 of his presidency, maintaining that this would not incite a trade war but instead incentivize fairer trade practices on the part of China. We need a strong-arm approach to China in order to make trade there as profitable for us as possible, something which Obama does not seem as well-equipped to do.

With November slowly approaching, the presidential election has sent the general public into a flurry of frenzied energy and constant debate. From Facebook statuses to Twitter updates, the entire country is spilling their thoughts onto the world wide web for all to see. And with every election, the political climate changes and citizens find a new way to voice their concerns.
During World War II, communication proved especially prevalent in the art sphere. Artists not only manifested their emotions about war and other issues through the canvas but also started to push the boundaries of the surface they worked on. By attacking the canvas, they hoped to create a new way of seeing and making art. The Museum of Contemporary Art looks back on this time of innovation with its show “Destroy the Picture: Painting the Void 1949-1962,” which opened Oct. 6. The exhibit showcases a range of artists that spans multiple nationalities and aesthetic preferences yet come together under the purpose of doing something new — and oftentimes destructive — with the average blank canvas.
Of all the artist-specific displays in the show, one stands out the most: the portion on Lee Bontecou. In particular, her “Untitled” (1962) causes the viewer to do a double-take and then inspires them to look closer to take in all the detail. Made of welded steel and canvas, the work extends out from its flat surface and pulls in the viewer. An amalgam of parts come together to create a telescopic creation that looks like something out of a dystopian movie. The canvas still exists, but only as a base for the three-dimensional pieces of the work. The pieces seem to rip through the canvas, asserting their own independence.
Most interestingly, Bontecou left an opening near the topmost part of the work through which the viewer can only see black. That small decision lends a haunting feeling to “Untitled,” creating an uncertainty as to whether we are truly looking at the work or if the work is actually looking back at us. What’s more, the black creates a visual abyss of sorts, adding to the three-dimensionality of the piece while giving it an ominous twist.
The explanatory text near Bontecou’s work refers to the importance of her teenage years during World War II. In a quote used for the text, Bontecou expresses that she “was angry” and “used to work with the United Nations program on the shortwave radio.”  That act greatly influenced her artwork and “in a way the anger became part of the process.”
The fact that, decades later, a visitor can still gauge a certain feeling of ire and frustration not only proves that Bontecou captured her emotion by breaking through the canvas, but that art can encapsulate a mood from a specific political era and still elicit a response generations later.
“Destroy the Picture,” then, does more than just show us the journey of moving away from traditional modes of art-making, it also displays the power of politically charged art. The strongest feature of “Untitled” is its ability to convey a timeless frustration. From small details, such as the arrangement of materials on the canvas, to the overall haunting look of the piece, there lies a genuine power in the artwork that will continue to endure the passage of time.
In this current political climate, it is important for modern artists to look back at artists such as Bontecou in order to push their own art. Creating a piece that this generation responds to is impressive, but making one that will elicit emotions from viewers decades later proves more powerful. The elements that escape the canvas of “Untitled” might stand for Bontecou’s style itself, which looked to announce the work as a means of conveying a real emotion, not just a visually stunning piece.
Bontecou ultimately looked to create art that showed her reaction to a specific event while also referring to universal themes. In another quote from the show, she explained that she wanted “to glimpse some of the fear, hope, ugliness, beauty, and mystery that exists in all of us and which hangs over all the young people today.” Bontecou took her generation’s frustrations and translated them onto the canvas, but ultimately also created a work that spoke to broad themes, such as fear that cross the boundaries of time.
“Untitled” might make some viewers uncomfortable. It might make some people wonder why something so harsh and aggressive hangs on a pristine museum wall. The fact that these thoughts will swirl inside the heads of MOCA’s many visitors serves as a testament to the power of Bontecou’s work. In order to stand out from the next group of artists, today’s artmakers must look at what makes a viewer react — oftentimes, that comes in the emotions stemming from political climate and change.
America might have moved beyond the effects of World War II, but politics always remains a constant subject of conversation; each day, citizens wake up to news that something is changing politically. Today’s artists know to move beyond the flat canvas, but the lesson that art can be more than just aesthetically pleasing should remain food for thought for this generation — and ones to come.

The classical music world can sometimes seem exclusive, with concerts frequented by the same culture aficionados who have season tickets to the ballet and the opera. It’s equally easy for outsiders to see the music as unrelatable and the performances as stuffy.

But the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra is making a shift away from the secluded spot classical music holds in American culture by offering intimate performances and profiles of up-and-coming composers.
One of the composers commissioned by LACO is USC’s own Andrew Norman. With bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the Thornton School of Music, Norman possesses an impressive musical resume.
Having loved music since he was a child, Norman claims that he would be nowhere if it weren’t for USC and the opportunities provided him during his time here.
“No one had one particular agenda or style that they wanted students to write in,” Norman recalled. “Thornton doesn’t have a set ideology when it comes to what kind of music should be made or why, which made me feel comfortable enough to push myself and even fail.”
Though Norman appreciates the freedom afforded to Thornton students, he credits most of his wisdom and experience to his professors and mentors.
“I had a spectacular piano professor, Stewart Gordon,” Norman said. “He taught me what it means to interpret a piece of music and the importance of bringing my own voice to such an old medium.”
Though the music that Norman composes is written for instruments and venues that have been around for a few hundred years, his brilliance stems from his ability to give his music a fresh sound.
“Think about Shakespeare, for example,” Norman said. “Actors have been performing his works for hundreds of years, but there is always a new way to read them, new intonations that can inflict a range of new meanings… [The same goes for] Bach. There’s a lot that he [wrote] down — notes, rhythms — but there’s also a lot open to interpretation.”
Though classical music has cultivated a notorious reputation for having complex structures in which many melodic themes are intertwined in one piece, Norman makes it his mission to take this old medium and come up with his own take: He stays vigilantly clear in the way he inflects the music and delivers it to his audience.
Norman’s precise and methodical approach to composing music has not gone unnoticed by the larger musical community. During his mid-20s, Norman was the proud recipient of the Rome Prize, a fellowship that allowed musicians, artists and writers to live and study in the birthplace of Western art and culture. Norman was also fortunate enough to win a similar fellowship in Berlin a few years later.
“These times abroad gave me an interesting perspective on what it means to be a composer today in the United States,” Norman said. “And these experiences continue to influence my music to this day.”
Professors and fellowships weren’t the only factors that had a resounding effect on Norman.
“Thornton is filled with so many students working at such high levels that I was inspired by them as much as I was by the professors,” Norman said. “[And while abroad], I got to meet so many interesting and talented musicians that were doing what I do in their own capacity.”
One of Norman’s oldest friends from USC, Joel Pargman, is currently a violinist at LACO and looks forward to performing original compositions from his USC roommate.
“Andrew’s music is always exciting, original, dramatic and full of story,” Pargman said. “His music resonates with me personally.”
And this personal resonance is one of the reasons why Norman is so thrilled about his future at LACO.
“LACO has a really special group of people that come together here,” Norman said. “Being L.A., a lot of players do studio work playing music scores and the like. But then they come here to LACO to play classical music, and there is such a sense of joy and excitement about playing Mozart and Beethoven.”
This joy is what first drew Norman to music as a child. Realizing the power of the medium and the way certain pieces could get him going, he wanted to be able to create that sensation for other people as well.
Norman’s goal to expand the classical music realm doesn’t stop at compositions; as a part of LACO, he will dive into the Los Angeles community, working with students in various schools. He’ll introduce younger students to the world of composition and what it means to write a piece of music, and will support high school students with the process of writing music.
Along with engaging youth in the community, Norman will continue writing some large works for the chamber orchestra to play — the first was performed in the spring of this year -— as well as serving as a resource for the orchestra in several areas.
“This is such an exciting time in music composition because barriers are coming down. What made classical seem intimidating is no longer part of the game,” Norman said. “For me, I listen to all different types of music and it all gets worked into my compositions. It’s so cool when I can take that aesthetic and write orchestra music with it.”

It’s often said that you are what you eat. In Israeli filmmaker Arnon Goldfinger’s new documentary, though, you are what you own.
Identity plays a major role in The Flat, which follows Goldfinger’s effort to piece together parts of his family history, which is full of questions and contradictions about the Holocaust.

The film begins with Goldfinger clearing the remnants of his grandmother’s home in Tel Aviv, Israel. Though his 98-year-old grandmother Gerda never appears in the documentary (except in photographs), her character takes on a life of its own, as her possessions — ranging from old minks to a Shakespeare collection — are organized and stuffed into plastic garbage bags. These scenes capture the no-limits nature of sifting through the belongings of a loved one and are especially impacting for anyone who has ever been placed in such a position.
While shuffling through Gerda’s items, Goldfinger is somewhat startled at the discovery of a Nazi tabloid known for unfettered propaganda. Piecing together clues from tattered photographs and faded newspaper clippings, Goldfinger discovers a relationship between his grandparents, German-Jews who moved to Tel Aviv in the 1930s and a high-ranking official in Adolf Hitler’s Ministry of Propaganda.
What makes the film special is that it is about more than simply what Gerda and her family physically own in the Tel Aviv flat. It also shines a light on what they own in terms of family history and collective memories.
Goldfinger’s discovery spurs a curiosity to understand the truth about what drove the close relationship between his grandparents and the Nazi propagandist Leopold Itz von Mildenstein — a relationship that continued even after the war ended and the Nazi’s crimes had been brought to the fore.
Denial exists on both sides of the relationship, as Goldfinger learns when he informs his mother and Mildenstein’s daughter of his findings. Unlike characters from the older generation, Goldfinger approaches the war more analytically and with less emotion. Rather than working toward accepting an incomplete history, Goldfinger constantly acquires the facts to compose an accurate account of the past.
The film then asks questions and examines how the merits of truth have changed from one generation to the next. Goldfinger’s mother, for one, was trained not to cast doubts on her family’s history. Throughout the film, she asks her son Arnon what the point of his quest is and why it is necessary. And it’s a fair question: Why stir the pot when all has been calm?
The divide between Goldfinger’s generation and that of his mother is clearly explained when Goldfinger interviews one of Gerda’s close friends.
“Why do only third-generation Germans ask questions?” Gerda’s friend asks. “The second generation didn’t ask what happened. You don’t understand and I’m glad you don’t understand.”
Distanced from history, Goldfinger is able to ask the questions that his mother never could, and, in the end, the film argues that this is a good thing.
Though the compelling story of Goldfinger’s quest drives The Flat, the film brings a careful attention to detail, particularly in Goldfinger’s direction. Repeated cuts to the opening of window shades, for example, convey a contemplative tone even before Goldfinger’s narration reinforces it. Techniques such as this help guide the film, giving the story greater depth by allowing it to visually establish an emotional connection with the audience.
The Flat might also intrigue audiences because its composition differs from most documentaries concerning the Holocaust. To tell his story, Goldfinger, who wrote and directed the film, breaks away from the History Channel model and refrains from using repeated images of ghettos or concentration camps. Instead, he relies on uncovering the truth about the past through the clues at his disposal — oral interviews, historical documents and public records.
At times, The Flat can be a little difficult to follow. But Goldfinger’s steady narration tempers this issue to an extent by helping those watching determine what is important information and what is irrelevant.
For a historically specific film, The Flat is uniquely universal. It is, at its core, a statement about the human character and contains something for everyone who has ever been plagued by the inescapable desire to answer the question: Where am I from?

Though you might not have found your Halloween costume yet, and certainly haven’t chosen the sides for your Thanksgiving dinner, a highlight of the Christmas music season has arrived.

Lady Antebellum, one of country music’s most popular groups, released its second Christmas album, On This Winter’s Night, on Monday. The album acts as a continuation of the band’s 2010 holiday record, A Merry Little Christmas. In fact, six of the 12 songs on Night are re-releases from Christmas.
As most Christmas albums do, Night features many Yuletide standards as covers that offer a change of pace from the classics. But some might be too different for their own good.
For instance, “This Christmas,” originally recorded by Donny Hathaway, suffers from a drastic tempo change that sharply contrasts with those of better-known versions. The slow, drawled nature of Lady Antebellum’s vocal talent doesn’t blend well with the trumpet-dominated musical interlude and leaves the listener confused at the country-big band hybrid.
The most severe departure from the source material is also the least successful song of the album. The group’s take on “All I Want for Christmas is You” is slowed down to play up the country twang, but it simply cannot compete with the Mariah Carey rendition. The radical tempo change has listeners missing the note-belting Carey to “make [their] wish come true.”
This song also demonstrates the album’s greatest obstacle: Some iconic recordings almost seem untouchable.
“All I Want for Christmas Is You” is one of them. Last year, even the almost duplicate version from the ever-popular television show Glee was just as unsuccessful as this reinterpreted country version. Sometimes the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mentality is true for a reason. And with so many Christmas albums in circulation from such a diverse array of artists, the repetition of songs eventually feels overwhelming and often numbing.
Luckily, Lady Antebellum makes significant impact on the Christmas music genre with the original “On This Winter’s Night.” Written by the group, the song plays to Lady Antebellum’s greatest strengths, such as balanced harmonies and pacing that appropriately matches the song’s message. The background choir reminding listeners to “count their blessings” seems unnecessary — and a bit cliche — but the song is refreshing on an album full of covers.
But interpreting the classics with the group’s signature sweet-and-slow-as-honey style isn’t always an uphill battle. Night also offers some positive examples of covering well-known Christmas hits.
“Have a Holly Jolly Christmas,” the album opener, shows the group’s ability to cross over from slow-paced ballads to upbeat party-starting songs. This might be the one song of the album that’s able to contend with its more famous predecessor — Burt Ives’ 1965 recording, in this case.
“I’ll Be Home for Christmas” uniquely blends the lead vocals of Lady Antebellum’s Hilary Scott and Charles Kelley and turns a song typically performed as a love letter into a perfectly balanced duet. And “The First Noel” and “Silent Night” are, unsurprisingly, the real gems of the album. Not only do the songs work well with Lady Antebellum’s characteristic style, but the thoughtful compositions and pitch-perfect voices bring the emotion and spirituality of the Christmas season to the forefront, really prepping the listener for hot cocoa and the distinctive scent of Christmas trees.
The climax of both well-known songs doesn’t quite surprise, but the group still offers a distinctly Southern twist. Meanwhile, the meld between Scott and Kelley’s verses in “Silent Night” provide insight into the chemistry of the group, with the song benefiting greatly from how well their voices complement one another.
Though “Let It Snow” highlights Scott’s vocal talents in a successful country-Christmas sing-a-long with a blend of electric guitar, violin and piano in the musical interludes, “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is Kelley’s chance to shine on the album. Though Kelley might not be Frank Sinatra, the tune in its country interpretation is both pleasant and festive.
Even with the ups and downs, Night is another notch in Lady Antebellum’s takeover of country music. Night won’t bridge pop and country in the way Shania Twain or Faith Hill previously have, but that’s not the point of the album.  Night shamelessly offers a country alternative to the same songs that are so characteristic of the holiday season without any pretense of being a cross over album. It’s simply Christmas, country-style.

A study released this year by the Department of Labor Time Use found that full-time men work more than five percent longer per week than their female counterparts. The same study explains that women are 34 percent less likely than men to be self-employed and own only 28.7 percent of American businesses.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Yet, many Americans continue to ignore these statistics and push misleading studies — such as the recent “Women in America” White House report that shows women making 75 cents to a man’s dollar — to imply that a biased society is causing women to unfairly make less money than men.
Because studies such as “Women in America” only account for the average total income of each gender, they ignore the trends and preferences of their participants.
Undeniably, it is the choices that some women make, rather than the unfairness of society, that adversely affect women’s median income.
The percentage of women working in part-time fields is perhaps the biggest factor affecting median salaries. In 2010, the Department of Labor found that women were more than 198 percent more likely to work in part-time positions than men. The same study found that women were 50 percent more likely to work in the public sector, where salaries are typically lower than they are in the private sector. And within the public sector, the Department of Labor found that women were 13 percent less likely than men to belong to unions.
This more holistic view of male and female tendencies provides a stronger understanding of gender-based income discrepancies. Some women in America make career choices that involve less-intensive hours and modest salaries. In contrast, men appear to be more likely to embrace full-time positions, gravitate toward the more lucrative private sector and belong to unions that can advocate for higher salaries. American men and women’s stark differences in work choices make it impossible to accurately analyze income discrimination from basic averaged salary figures.
To gain an accurate view of gender-based income biases, Americans must look toward studies involving equally qualified participants.
Economist June O’Neill, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, found that when controlling for equal education, experience and tenure, women make 92 percent of what men earn. And when the study was adjusted for women without children, men earned only 2 cents more per dollar.
Studies from June O’Neill and the Department of Labor Time Use lend credence to the idea that American women have equal opportunity to earn equal salaries. This is true especially today, when, contrary to popular opinion, women are increasingly taking full advantage of the opportunities available to them.
In March, Time reported that the majority of working wives will out-earn their husbands within the next generation. And the same study showed that single, working women with no children are already earning more than their male peers in the majority of U.S. urban cities.
Much of this growth can be attributed to the role that education is playing in the trajectory of young women’s lives. According to The Atlantic, three women will receive a B.A. this year for every two men who do the same. This upward swing signifies the changing cultural demographics across America — one in which a woman’s path revolves less around the home and family and more so around her own personal and professional interests. American women now, more so than ever before, can write their own futures and fulfill their own workplace goals. Any governmental policy that tries to skew the system in women’s favors devalues the entire gender’s accomplishments and belittles women’s ability.
Arguments can certainly be made for the fact that gender roles and societal influences are at the root of the reason why women have historically made less than men. But, as we’ve seen with the unfairness of affirmative action procedures, generalizing an entire group to mold progressive governmental policies only exacerbates inequality.
Our culture has become obsessed with fixing every minute social discrepancy in our academic, professional and personal lives. But many of these aspects, including gender-based income inequality, are best left to be adjusted and corrected themselves.

During the 2000 presidential election, Florida came under fire after counting hundreds of absentee ballots in violation of the law. For conservative policymakers, that scenario continues to illustrate the high failure rate and fraud that accompanies absentee ballots.
Voter fraud, however, is less of a problem than is commonly believed, with the Justice Department  finding in 2005 that there were very few cases of widespread fraud, according to The New York Times. Meanwhile, absentee voting can increase voter turnout and can offer a reliable system. In order for America’s democracy to flourish and include a more diverse voting population, absentee voting needs to become a standard that is accepted nationwide.
With rising tuition fees and budget cuts to public education, the voices of low-income minorities and college students are integral to the nation’s change.  Many states, however, are hunkering down on voter access.
Texas recently called on the U.S. Supreme Court to allow handgun licenses, but not university identification cards, as acceptable forms of voter identification. In August, the Justice Department ruled this law unconstitutional under Section 5 of the Civil Rights Act, because it would disproportionately affect low-income blacks who lack the money and resources to obtain handgun licenses. Though well-intentioned, Texas’ effort to crack down on voter fraud by undermining students’ voting rights while supporting the rights of gun owners sent a negative message.
But the problem does not stop at Texas — Tennessee, South Carolina and Wisconsin are all instituting a slew of laws to block out student voters, banning student IDs and out-of-state driver’s licenses as acceptable forms of identification. These regulations discourage absentee voting for out-of-state and non-residential university students. With a young generation growing up in a world of globalization, geographic mobility is increasing. More students are applying to college than ever before and heavily rely on absentee voting. There is already so much apathy among college-aged voters. Making the voting process harder will create another excuse for them not to vote, which is the last thing the country needs.
Mail-in voting does not only impact college students, but also low-income minorities. For some disadvantaged communities, the closest voting booth could be miles away. By offering underrepresented citizens a convenient means to vote, mail-in ballots will increase their voter participation.
Ultimately, the problem does not lie with absentee voting itself but states’ lack of strict enforcement and conviction against voter fraud. If the federal government mandated the establishment of nationwide regulations for mail-in absentee voting, states would adhere to the same standards. Unable to half-heartedly enforce their own absentee voting laws, states would be held accountable for abusers of absentee ballots.
Without a doubt, absentee voting should become a right for all citizens in every state. Failing to do so will only do a disservice to our democracy and leave a large and diverse group of citizens unable to pursue an essential civic duty.
