I’m going to make a general statement that countless other digitally-focused writers have shared: I’m addicted to my phone and, more specifically, to social media.
I’ve avoided admitting that dependency for a while now. Not because I was ashamed — considering it’s a widespread disease that affects more than 210 million people worldwide — but because I tried convincing myself that I wasn’t. Addicted just felt like too strong of a word, something most would associate with alcoholics or regular drug users. I thought, surely I’m not as bad as them. Surely I find my life valuable beyond my narcissism-driven scrolling habits. Surely, even though I consider social media my profession, my world wouldn’t end without it, right?
These are common internal inquiries shared by young, avid technology users (well, maybe not the last one, but you get the idea). Such concerns are sensible. No one wants to admit their humanity is tied to an inherently inhuman device. Objectively, our phones and social media are simply supposed to be extensions of ourselves, but when we constantly have this technology in our hands, pockets, backpacks and at our bedside tables, the line between extension and essential becomes increasingly blurred.
As a case study, a casual stroll through USC Village reveals how our phones are absolutely interwoven with our everyday lives — checking email, communicating with friends, mobile-ordering food, listening to music, you name it. Though, I imagine most people, if approached, would vigorously defend their digital habits, arguing they could exist independently from their phones if they wanted to. Alright, bet.
I came to the conclusion that I had an addiction when I began closely observing, not how I spent my free time, but rather how I occupied the commercial breaks between my scheduled activities. Many people — myself included— fall prey to checking social media first thing in the morning and last thing before going to sleep (check out Erik Pickersgill’s haunting photo series on this specific phenomenon for a memorable visual), but what about all the other moments in between? Walking to class. Getting bored at work. Waiting to meet friends. Eating food alone. Avoiding eye contact with passersby. These activities all had one thing in common: When I had the opportunity to momentarily unplug, I chose otherwise.
This past week, I decided to test this newfound theory on myself and assess how I felt. On four separate days, especially when I was anxious about the day’s to-do list, the first thing I did in the morning was delete Instagram from my phone. Then, come the evenings on those same four days, I re-downloaded the app to my device.
Between deletion and download, I noticed how frequently I motioned to check Instagram and how impulsive the action itself was. Once I remembered I didn’t have the app, I usually substituted the desire with a different app — namely Twitter or Snapchat, which I honestly don’t even like that much. To some degree, I realized it wasn’t about the app itself but instead the act of scrolling. I would get bored of those apps more quickly than with Instagram, so I was able to get off my phone more and focus better throughout the day. Every once in a while, though, there was a ticking thought in the back of my mind, reminding me of my countdown to when I could download Instagram again. This “reward” at the end of the day always proved temporarily satisfying but overall underwhelming, leaving me to wonder why that moment had such an enticing buildup in the first place. And repeat.
After my diagnosis, I found myself having more conversations with my peers about their social media consumption routines. Since Apple released its screen time feature in 2018, more individuals have been adopting methods to curb their digital intake, considering the average person spends three hours and 15 minutes per day on their phone. Some have placed time limits on certain apps — but, let’s be honest, the restriction is easily bypassed. One of my friends turned their display to black and white and claimed their screen time was cut in half, and many more have reverted to this option to counter our biological tendency toward colorful objects. On the flip side, many social media lovers have chosen to embrace how much time they spend on their phones because of how necessary they are to their livelihoods. For instance, one of my TikTok influencer friends with more than 900,000 followers admitted to spending double digit hours on her phone at times. For myself, I usually fall around the average screen time, so placing my phone in a different room or removing apps usually does the trick.
Whether a user opts in or out of these features, what we’re seeing is a reintroduction of choice with society’s technological habits, which is the real breadwinner in my eyes. Personally, I couldn’t care less if you spend two or 12 hours a day on your phone as long as it is by your will that the deed is done.
When I wrote this column, I did indeed delete Instagram and Snapchat off my phone for the day. Have I already checked Instagram via desktop a couple of times? Maybe, but I suppose old habits die hard. Moving forward, my goal is simply to be mindful of where my attention is going and encourage my readers to do the same. So, if you catch me endlessly scrolling through TikToks in my downtime, please slap my phone out of my hand. Until next time, fellow internet addicts.

SDA’s newest production, “Men on Boats,” looks at an 1869 expedition to the Grand Canyon through a contemporary lens, featuring a diverse all-female cast. 
Following the somewhat fictionalized journey of Major John Wesley Powell (played by Casey Gardner) and his eccentric group of explorers as they sail down the Colorado to chart the frontier, the group encounters hardship from both the natural world and each other. High-stakes sequences of sailing down rapids and power struggles between leadership are balanced by wistful moments of discovery and an undercurrent of brotherhood among the men. 
The play, written by Jaclyn Backhaus in 2017, was created with an all-female cast in mind. By taking an event that historically involved only white men and retelling it through the perspective of a multicultural group of women, previously overlooked groups are included in the American Frontier narrative. 
“I am always fascinated with telling stories and experiences of those who have been forgotten, who have been erased or dismissed, not included in history and historical context,” said Anita Dashiell-Sparks, the show’s director. “[The play] challenges us to consider who really has the opportunity to be an innovator, to be an explorer [and] who has the opportunity and the agency to claim land and objects and things within it as their own.”
For the show, production designers created a space reminiscent of the frontier, yet one that would not overshadow the play’s plot. The dynamic set consists of two wood structures featuring two “river” tubs filled with real water that drenches the actors and splashes onto the stage. 
Despite the name of the play, there are no physical boats — the vessels are instead conveyed through ropes, blue silks and pantomiming. Painted on the floor is an expansive chart of American rivers, reminding audiences of just how large this uncharted territory was and what a challenging task the river crew undertook. The story comes to life as the evocative sound design floods audiences with the thundering waterfalls and folksy tunes that Americans associate with the lore of the frontier. 
Despite minor prop mistakes, which the cast quickly adapted to, the production was full of emotional intensity and dedicated character work. The actors transform into rugged mountain men who progress steadily from enthusiastic explorers to worn down sailors unsure of what to do with themselves once they get off the Colorado. Gardner as Major John Wesley Powell has the calm command of the stage that an expedition leader would, and Blake Fisher as William Dunn counters her with a nuanced, uncouth power. The rest of the cast creates distinctive, memorable personas, a difficult task when there is a boat crew of 10 and a full cast of 13. 
This play is a testament that we don’t have to erase history; instead, we must reimagine how it is told, and that is precisely what Dashiell-Sparks did.
“We have a part in how we preserve history, how we archive it, how we tell it and how we rewrite it, because it is always being written,” Dashiell-Sparks said. 
For centuries, the rich history of indigenous and native cultures, the stories of women and the talent of minorities have all been omitted from history. But history is alive and well, and there is now an opportunity to rediscover half our national narrative that was previously lost. “Men on Boats” creates a national folklore that modern audiences can rally behind. This new American spirit allows for the joy of discovering the new frontier, the admiration of beautiful landscapes and the uniquely 1869 experience of “naming stuff” without erasing the detrimental effects of Manifest Destiny and the exploitation of the indigenous people. 
Although the historical event that inspired “Men on Boats” solely comprised white men, the active choice to depict this story with a diverse cast of women is a step toward creating an American history that all Americans can be included in and proud of. 
“Men on Boats” runs at McClintock Theatre from Oct. 3 to Oct. 6.

What happens when an artist feels like they’ve hit their peak? When nothing they make can ever top their magnum opus? “Pain and Glory” is the manifestation of this feeling, and it captures it in the most honest way possible. 
Loosely based on the life of Pedro Almodóvar — the director of “Volver” and “Julieta” — “Pain and Glory” follows the life of Salvador Mallo (played by Antonio Banderas) as an aging director going through artist’s block and reminiscing about the past. Set in Madrid, the film delves into the journey of an artist’s physical and mental decline and, in doing so, is nothing short of a creative triumph. 
The film was screened at the School of Cinematic Arts’ Ray Stark Family Theatre Tuesday night in front of a packed house. 
For someone who has never seen an Almodóvar film before, the structure can be confusing at first. The film goes back and forth between the present, Mallo’s early childhood and his days with his mother in the last stages of her life. The first half of the film is especially complex, but this in no way should discourage moviegoers. 
As the film unravels, each piece begins to connect, with the narrative intentionally flowing like the inside of Mallo’s mind. The audience directly experiences his memories and the emotions associated with them. When Mallo reminisces, the audience shares in his  bittersweet nostalgia. When he cries, the audience aches with him. 
Banderas’ performance as the witty, washed up heroin addict and struggling director is fantastically subtle, authentic and incredibly raw. In an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival, the actor talked about how the emotions triggered from his heart attack two and a half years ago greatly influenced his performance in this film. Almodóvar was able to see how the attack affected him and asked Banderas to channel those same emotions into Mallo’s character. The result is a standout performance. 
“Without filmmaking, my life is meaningless,’’ Mallo said in the movie.
With little left in his life and seemingly no films left to make, this statement rings true. As the film continues to reassert, however, it is the people who have come in and out of his life that have given Mallo purpose as well. “Pain and Glory” isn’t just a story about the artists’ struggle; it’s the story of a difficult yet vibrant childhood, intense heartbreak and the complicated relationship between mother and son. All relationships in this movie are fleshed out and nuanced, especially the dialogue written between a much older Jacinta and Salvador. 
Aside from Banderas’ performance, the score is exceptional. Three-time Academy Award nominee and recipient of the Cannes Soundtrack Award at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival Alberto Iglesias elevates the movie with the score, especially with scenes of Mallo as a child. His work is masterful. Each piece perfectly encapsulates the complexity of emotions Almodovór conveys in each scene. The score shifts genres with the different stages of Mallo’s life, with music in the scenes of his later life incorporating electronic elements as well. The score is innovative, beautiful and enriches audiences with emotions and sentiment. 
Almodóvar’s film also explores sexuality.
“I don’t really consider myself or want to be the pioneer of anything,’’ Almodovar said in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly. “But what I take very seriously is to be able to portray the very different gamuts of sexuality that exist for all kinds of human beings and to represent that as honestly as possible. And not from the lens of activism, but from the position of being true to life.’’ 
The intimate portrayal of LGBTQ+ characters in a formerly conservative Spain and allowing for nuanced, multidimensional and honest representation of these individuals is something Almodóvar not only strives for but succeeds in. “Pain and Glory” brings to light not just the story of the first experience of infatuation, but also gets audiences invested in a relationship between older men, something not often seen in LGBTQ+  cinema, according to Almodóvar. 
“I don’t like autofiction,’’ Mallo’s mother Jacinta scoffs in the movie, almost representing Almodóvar’s voice as the hesitant filmmaker, someone afraid to put aspects of their life on film. 
While writing about personal experiences can allow for greater opportunities for people to relate, the doors opened for interpretation on one’s life may be an unintended consequence. The balance is difficult to navigate. It truly pays off, however, with Almodóvar proving that being intensely vulnerable can make for profound content.

Since USC football has a bye this week, this week’s column is going to focus on a topic I’ve been ruminating on for a few weeks now. As the NBA season approaches and the hype continues to build, I’m most interested to see one outcome: how Anthony Davis fares for the Los Angeles Lakers this season.
Davis has been a fascinating case study in how the public views uber-talented players. He started out as a darling of all, the indisputable first pick in the 2012 NBA Draft who went to New Orleans and immediately dominated, putting up statistics that were unprecedented for players his age. His 30.81 Player Efficiency Rating in 2014-15 is the 13th best of all time and by far the best mark ever for a 21-year-old.
But as Davis’ career continued and his Pelicans teams struggled to even make the postseason, some began to question Davis for the first time. If he was so talented, why couldn’t he carry his teams to success in the sport most influenced by superstars? 
Davis has made only two postseason appearances but was brilliant in both. He averaged 31.5 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks per game while being swept by the Golden State Warriors in 2015 and absolutely dismantled the No. 3 seed Portland Trail Blazers before bowing out to the Warriors again in the second round in 2018. The polarized discourse around how good Davis really was intensified. He could never quite seem to put it all together from both a team and an individual standpoint.
Then came Davis’ 2018-19 season, one of the strangest for a star in recent memory. On Jan. 26, the Pelicans lost to the Spurs 128-112, moving the team to a disappointing 22-28 record following the success of the previous season. Two days later, Davis’ agent Rich Paul — who represents his good friend LeBron James and runs the Klutch Sports Group, in which James is heavily involved — announced that Davis was requesting a trade.
The announcement wasn’t all that surprising considering the crappy teams the Pelicans had put around Davis, but what followed further soured his public image. Paul released a short list of teams with which Davis would re-sign that included the Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers, New York Knicks and Milwaukee Bucks before Davis made a confusing TV appearance during All-Star Weekend announcing all 29 other teams were on his list. That didn’t sit well with Pelicans fans and gave the public the idea that Davis was sending out mixed signals.
The Lakers desperately tried to set up a trade for Davis involving some of their promising young players, but after the deal ultimately fell through, the public nature of these negotiations contributed to these players underperforming as the Lakers sputtered to the 11th seed.
Then things got really ugly. Davis was held out of games by the Pelicans as trade talks continued. He only played sporadically after the trade deadline and missed the final seven games as the relationship between him and the Pelicans turned irrevocably icy. He showed up to the team’s final game wearing a “That’s all folks” shirt that, along with his unwillingness to honor his contract and the way that his agency handled the relationship with the Pelicans organization, pushed fans and media pundits alike to question Davis’ behavior and status as a true superstar. There were bad feelings all around: The Pelicans felt that Paul and the Lakers had tried to strongarm New Orleans into trading Davis to L.A. and seemed to take pleasure in denying the Lakers his services by turning down and leaking multiple trade offers. 
But Davis was eventually traded to the Lakers in June for a boatload of future assets. Davis got exactly what he wanted — he’s in the nation’s second biggest market, and he’s playing for perhaps the league’s signature franchise with one of the greatest players of all time in James.
But I keep thinking about that old saying: Be careful what you wish for. The pressure is now on Davis in a way it never has been at any other time in his career. He’s on a better team, yes, but that means the excuses are gone and the expectations are higher. The spotlight in L.A. is a different animal from New Orleans, one of the NBA’s most apathetic fanbases. The Lakers have won the second-most championships of all time and have upheld a tradition of excellence that fans and the organization alike are desperate to return to this season. 
There’s also the fact that James is the perfect partner for Davis, or any other player for that matter. With his size, court vision and basketball IQ, he is perhaps the greatest passing forward ever. James will live to feed the Brow, and that’s been evidenced by reports from training camp that the two already have a strong connection. It was also proven by the team’s first preseason game Saturday night, where the two combined for 37 points on 14-for-26 shooting in a win over the Warriors.
“We’re talking and trying to help each other out,” Davis said after the game of his relationship with James, according to ESPN. “The more we can do that, the easier the game will be for us and our teammates.”
Preseason excitement is great and all, but none of it matters once the regular season starts, and it damn sure doesn’t matter come playoff time. Davis is playing with one of the five greatest players ever; if he wants to take his place in basketball’s pantheon, he needs to come through this year. That means his usual stunning numbers and a case in the MVP race, but more importantly, a top three seed and a championship for the Lakers. No exceptions.
Davis is somewhat in limbo right now, caught between the all-time great everyone wants him to be and the misplaced talent that we all saw last season. He’s got a lot riding on this campaign — not only to retain his reputation in the short term but to vault into the conversation as one of the greats.

This year’s USC football team can be summed up in a single word: unpredictable. The Trojans have bounced in and out of the AP Top 25, winning games against Stanford and Utah they were expected to lose and conceding a game against non-conference BYU they were heavily favored to win. Now that USC has a bye week to prepare for No. 9 Notre Dame, let’s reflect on what has gone well, what has gone poorly and what we can look forward to seeing from the Trojans in the coming weeks.
What’s gone well:
Air Raid offense (for the most part)
Offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s Air Raid scheme has been a positive change for a Trojan offense ranked 91st in points scored in 2018. The pass-heavy strategy highlights the Trojans’ talent at wide receiver and has resulted in some big performances, including senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr.’s 232-yard outing against Utah. While the game plan fell a little short against Washington as USC’s offense relied on short passes and runs rather than deep balls, overall the Air Raid scheme has allowed the Trojan offense to shock its opponents with its quick tempo.
Young defense stepping up
Sophomores safety Talanoa Hufanga and cornerback Olaijah Griffin sat out last Saturday against Washington due to injury, while redshirt sophomore cornerback Greg Johnson was benched for the first quarter due to violation of a team rule. Despite the absence of these starters, the Trojan defense was able to keep USC within striking distance of Washington. Freshman cornerback Max Williams, who played in Johnson’s place, forced a fumble just before the goal line that was recovered by the Huskies for a score. In the fourth quarter, freshman cornerback Chris Steele recovered a fumble in Washington territory, handing the Trojans a chance to close the gap. The Trojans’ defensive depth is promising, especially as they counter a Notre Dame offense which put up 52 unanswered points against Bowling Green Saturday.
What’s gone poorly:
Inexperienced starters playing on the road 
We saw it with freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis in his second start against BYU, and we saw it again with redshirt junior quarterback Matt Fink in his first nod at Washington: Playing on the road is tough for Trojan backups. Slovis’s rocky start at BYU came after a breakout performance against Stanford in which he completed 84.8% of his passes for 377 yards and three touchdowns. However, Slovis’ road debut was marred by three interceptions, two of which gave BYU the ball well into Trojan territory.
After Slovis went down on just the second play of USC’s game against then-No. 10 Utah, Fink stepped up to the challenge. He threw for 351 yards, three touchdowns and just one interception en route to victory that would have been unexpected even if the Trojans weren’t on their third-string quarterback. The following week at Washington, Fink’s passing game was all but shut down as he threw for just 163 yards and three costly picks.
Whoever the starter is this upcoming game will need to minimize these errors against an unforgiving Notre Dame defense to give the Trojans a chance to outpace the Fighting Irish.
Slow offensive starts
The Trojan defense has kept USC in games, but the offense needs to get off to quicker starts to give USC a chance to outscore top offensive opponents including Notre Dame and Oregon. The Trojans average just 7.6 points in the first quarter this season — mediocre next to Notre Dame’s 11.2 point average to start out games. Notre Dame is 11th in the nation with 41 points per game, so the Trojans must begin quickly Saturday to have a chance at outpacing the Fighting Irish.
What to look forward to:
Getting healthy
In last week’s 28-14 loss at Washington, the Trojans were missing Slovis, Hufanga and Griffin. Slovis and Hufanga, both recovering from concussions, have been cleared to practice without contact, while Griffin has returned to practice and is expected to start against Notre Dame Saturday. The ability of the Trojan secondary to recover during the bye week is significant as it faces senior quarterback Ian Book, who has a 13 to 2 touchdown-to-interception ratio this season. Slovis’ health also remains a concern heading into another road game given Fink’s less-than-stellar performance at Washington last weekend.
Mixing up the pass and run
Notre Dame has a versatile defense with the ability to create turnovers both at the line and against the pass. Given that Notre Dame has six interceptions and seven forced fumbles through five games, the Trojans cannot afford to be predictable and rely too heavily on the passing game. USC has a stacked backfield including junior Stephen Carr, redshirt junior Vavae Malepeai and redshirt freshman Markese Stepp and must mix in the run game to open up the lanes for its talented receivers. The Trojans can’t repeat the mistake they made against Washington of throwing mainly short routes and not allowing their receivers the opportunity to make contested deep catches. A balance between the pass and run is required to put the pressure on a Notre Dame defense, which is prepared to counter both sides of the game.
Ultimately, the Trojans’ success in the tail end of the season will come down to consistency.

Trojan Shelter will open its doors at St. Mary’s Episcopal Church in Koreatown on Nov. 3 to six students in the South Los Angeles area in need of homes  in an effort that is student created and run. Senior Abigail Leung and junior Esther Cha created the shelter, a place for students experiencing homelessness to live until they transition into more permanent housing, after taking a class last year with Cara Esposito, a professor in the Price School of Public Policy. 
During one lesson, Esposito invited Louis Tse, the founder of Bruin Shelter at UCLA, to speak to students about how he founded the first shelter in Los Angeles for college students experiencing homelessness.
Immediately after, Cha and Leung told Esposito they were interested in establishing a shelter for USC students, approaching her with a concrete plan soon after.
“I never in my wildest dreams thought [Cha and Leung] would come to me nine months later and say, ‘We found a space. We want to do this,’” Esposito said.
Now Esposito serves as Trojan Shelter’s faculty mentor and Tse is a mentor through Students4Students, formerly Bruin Shelter, the shelter’s parent nonprofit organization.
After founding Trojan Shelter in Fall 2018, Cha and Leung assembled a six-member executive board to help them with the processes of securing the shelter’s location, renovating the space and recruiting volunteers to help run the shelter, among other tasks.
“It’s been a long process,” Esposito said. “Not in any fault of theirs. It’s just super challenging navigating the city on this issue. They’re basically building a new company, so it’s a big lift. So it’s been a lot of having to deal with permitting and architects and lease agreements and government principles and raising money. It’s just a lot, [because] they’re [also] full-time students.”
Upon its opening, the shelter will be able to house six students who are enrolled in at least two units for the academic year in the first floor of the church, which is residentially zoned. In the future, Cha and Leung hope to house 12 to 16 students in Trojan Shelter, though expanding the shelter space would require rezoning and renovations.
For now, Leung said she and Cha hope to find a home for as many students they can as soon as possible, opening more space as they move forward. 
Now that the shelter is almost ready, volunteers are completing their training to assist residents during daily operations and overnight shifts as well as putting final decorative touches on the shelter.
“When we first started Trojan Shelter, we wanted to find a space that we would personally love to live in that would feel like a home to us, and we really feel like this is a perfect space for that,” Cha said.
In the days leading up to its opening, Trojan Shelter is gathering resources like school supplies and food for the students who will live there. 
Cha and Leung are also working to partner with on-campus organizations to host supply drives, including a food drive with the Trojan Knights and the USC Helenes during their respective Tommy and Hecuba Watches during rivalry week and a school supply drive with the Korean Christian Ministry. Last semester, they worked with Alpha Phi Omega, a service organization, to expand the shelter’s food pantry.
But beyond partnerships with other on-campus organizations, Cha and Leung hope that the University will get involved and inspire other campuses to address student homelessness.
“Our vision down the line is to make this an established partnership with USC,” Cha said. “And hopefully, other universities around the nation will follow suit. In terms of short-term goals, our goals are to open, to expand and to solidify the idea and the fact that there are a lot of students experiencing homelessness. And hopefully once people realize it is an issue, they’ll start doing more things about it.”
Applications for housing are open to all students in the area, not just USC students. Those who are not offered bedspace immediately will be sent additional resources and will be reconsidered when a space becomes available.
The application for housing can be found online at trojanshelter.org.

A USC parent who attempted to pay $300,000 to secure his daughter’s admission to the University was sentenced to five months in prison and 500 hours of community service and ordered to pay a fine of $100,000 in federal court Friday. 
Former businessman and Napa Valley winemaker Agustin Huneeus Jr.’s hearing marked the second sentencing of a USC parent and the fifth parent sentencing overall in the Operation Varsity Blues admissions scandal, according to CNN. An FBI investigation released in March stated that more than 20 USC students were admitted to the University through bribes and fake athletic profiles. 
Huneeus’ sentence is the heaviest to date among those indicted by the FBI, exceeding the four-month prison sentence handed down to waterTALENT founder and CEO Devin Sloane last Tuesday, but is far lighter than the 15-month sentence advised by federal attorneys.
Huneeus’ daughter was conditionally accepted to the Class of 2023, but the admissions offer was rescinded upon his arrest with a portion of the bribe payment still pending. 
Of the $300,000 Huneeus pledged to spend on his daughter’s admission, $50,000 was paid to William “Rick” Singer, the Newport Beach-based businessman behind the admissions bribery scheme, to alter her SAT scores. Singer’s co-founded The Edge College & Career Network, a for-profit business accused of running the scam. Singer pleaded guilty to all charges in March.
Hunneus planned to pay the remaining $250,000 to falsely identify his daughter as a USC water polo recruit. However, only $50,000 of the athletics bribe was finalized before Huneeus was charged in the case.
Because the final payment was not made and Huneeus’ daughter was not officially granted admission, Huneeus’ attorneys argued for a light sentence of two months in prison and 350 hours of community service. However, federal prosecutors deemed a harsher sentence appropriate due to Huneeus’ involvement in both aspects of the admissions scandal — he was one of only a few parents to offer bribes for fraudulent athletic recruitment and SAT score adjustment.
Huneeus’ daughter allegedly knew about the bribes but has not been named in the case. 
According to an informational page on its website last updated Aug. 13, USC will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Justice in the investigation. 
“We are in the process of identifying donations that may have been received in connection with the alleged scheme and determining how to redirect those funds,” USC wrote. “We will take all necessary steps to safeguard the integrity of our admissions process and to ensure we conduct ourselves in a manner consistent with our values.”

EDITOR’S NOTE: The headline, caption and body of this article was updated to correctly reflect that USC is one of the most applied to private colleges in the United States. The article previously reported it was ranked first in the list. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
The Class of 2023 is the most selective and among the most diverse in University history, USC News reported Friday. 
USC accepted 7,558 students and enrolled about 42% of those students in Fall 2019, marking the highest yield rate in University history. Over 66,000 students applied, ranking USC among the most applied to private colleges.
With an 11.4% acceptance rate, the freshman class’ admissions cycle continues the University’s upward trend in selectivity. USC’s acceptance rate first dipped below 20% in 2014 with the Class of 2018 and has seen a decrease every year since 2015. 
Female students make up 55% of the Class of 2023, a 7.8% increase from the past two years. 
African American enrollment has also seen a notable change, increasing by 13% from last year’s freshman class. Otherwise, diversity with regard to underrepresented minorities remains about even with last year’s statistics, as an estimated one in four freshmen self-identifies as a member of an underrepresented minority.
Obi Onwuamaegbu, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the University’s diverse student body is a welcomed change from his hometown of Bethesda, Md.
“I came from a pretty homogenous background,” Onwuamaegbu said. “My city was predominantly white … It’s definitely been refreshing to come here and learn about different cultures and different identities.”
Onwuamaegbu, a member of the Black Student Assembly, said he has noticed the University’s diversity reflected in the organization’s membership, which he said numbers more than 100.
“You come in, and it’s more of a community,” Onwuamaegbu said. “I’m participating in the same type of things I would in high school, but the degree to which they’re affecting me and the degree to which I’m participating and [feeling] actively involved in [them] has changed.”
Geographic diversity has also seen a slight increase. The share of first-year students coming from California high schools dropped 4.9% from the previous year, and the proportions coming from other U.S. high schools and from international high schools have both increased slightly.
Catarina de Souza, a freshman majoring in architecture, said that USC’s diversity has already impacted her college experience.
De Souza, an international student from Salvador, Brazil, said the peers she has met through BRASA, a campus organization mainly composed of Brazilian international students, have helped her acclimate to campus life.
“I’ve met people from all sorts of backgrounds, and even if they are American, they usually have some type of background that is unusual or different,” de Souza said. “Many people have lived in more than one country before coming here, and many speak various languages.”
While the Class of 2023 comprises 15% first-generation students, a decrease from last year’s 17%, the University continues to rank high among schools of similar academic caliber, tying UC Berkeley’s first-generation enrollment. Socioeconomic diversity remains high, with an estimated two-thirds of freshmen receiving financial assistance, including 629 merit scholarship recipients.
With the levels of diversity and achievement reflected in this year’s freshman class, students hope the University continues to up its efforts to maintain a student body of varied identities, backgrounds and contributions.
“I hope that [USC Admission] continue what they’ve been doing in terms of building diverse incoming classes,” Onwuamaegbu said. “Just so that the different students coming into USC can learn about cultures and identities different from their own and help them grow as people.”

Your Sept. 17 article on the merging of the School of International Relations with the Department of Political Science describes “strong support of the majority of the faculty” and hopes for “more resources” for students. 
In fact, SIR faculty was not strongly supportive of the merger. Many had serious reservations given SIR’s tradition of rich programming for its students and its long history of independence (since 1924, the third oldest school of international relations in the world). The vote that is cited as evidence of “strong support” for the merger merely approved a structure for the combined unit once the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Deans made it clear that the merger would proceed regardless of faculty concerns.
As for resources, since the merger process began in 2017, SIR has actually seen cuts to undergraduate resources — including the loss of two permanent advising positions (one for academics, the other for internship and career support). Reliance in teaching on temporary or part-time lecturers (instead of long-term, full-time faculty) has meanwhile grown sharply. We note with concern that, over this same period, the number of SIR majors has fallen alarmingly.

There’s a variety of reasons people stop at City Hall: They’re headed to the top floor for the observation deck with a view of Los Angeles, they’re an actor shooting a scene in a city government-looking building or they want to stop by the mayor’s office for a quick chat over coffee. But what most people don’t know is that Los Angeles City Planning occupies several floors at City Hall. And from telling people where I work, I’ve found that most people don’t really know what the city planning department does. 
With so many new developments shaping L.A.’s future, now is the time Angelenos must think proactively about city planning. From how we go about our morning commute to how we vote in elections, there are small changes we can make to our everyday lives that can improve our community and the city of L.A.
Urban planning is left relatively undiscussed, and many don’t realize this term touches so many aspects of L.A. life. The department is responsible for deciding the locations for bus stops, various buildings and zones and choosing where public projects are set and where private development can take place. 
Before USC was constructed, its stakeholders and various designers and architects had to submit plans to the city planning department to ensure it would comply with zoning and safety regulations. But they also considered how it would affect factors like the local economy, community culture and planning projects in the neighboring area. The high number of LA Metro Expo Line stops around campus is thanks to urban planning (and former USC President Steven Sample).
There are several ways to think proactively about how planning works in our everyday lives, and while it’s impossible for everyone to be familiar with every aspect of L.A.’s city planning, the least we can do is try to understand how our actions shape our city.
The first step toward being more involved in L.A.’s future is to start utilizing public infrastructure and living more sustainably. Most public projects are only able to secure funding or improvement if they can prove they are actually used. A good example is Pershing Square — it had hoped to be as lively and booming as Union Square in San Francisco, but unfortunately, design choices and a lack of popularity led to what the Los Angeles Times calls “a perplexing failure” in an editorial that ran four years ago.
Ineffective design is one thing, but there are several places throughout L.A. that would benefit from use. Though it may feel insignificant, taking a walk through Pershing Square on your way to the French restaurant Perch makes a difference. It defies notions that the space is “unsafe” or “unused” hopefully those around will take note and make the choice to walk through the Square another time. A small cafe or retailer that notices traffic through the area could open a space in the Square or nearby, further promoting use. This leads to more people, more development and a livelier community space.
While there are certain quotas for green space and public use projects, these can fall into disrepair when they are unnoticed and unused. Developers then move in and create dense residential spaces, like the various high-rise apartments being constructed downtown, and while this isn’t inherently a bad thing, it erodes the opportunity for continually observing, bumping into and meeting different people as well as engaging in diversity of thought.
We should also ride the bus or train more often, frequent local parks and libraries and spend time in places created for the community. While having places solely for work and housing is efficient, it cuts at the aspects that make us more empathetic and involved in our communities. This is why planning prioritizes mixed-use development — having retail, residential, commercial and public use spots all nearby promotes social life and a variety of interactions. But we need to go outside and use these spaces!
Being informed and involved in the legislation and planning for local developments is another way to have a say in how L.A. will look in future years.
One recently passed ordinance at the end of 2018 by City Council places limits on short-term rentals like AirBnBs to create more long-term rental opportunities for Angelenos rather than brief stays for tourists. Regardless of whether you agree or disagree, you’ll be affected by them, especially if you want to spend a night in North Hollywood over fall break. 
Senate Bill 827, otherwise known as the Transit Zoning Bill, allows for denser housing development near transit stations and would address California’s housing crisis. It didn’t pass, and perhaps if more people signed the California “Yes In My Backyard!” petition, it would have.
We can’t vote on senate bills, but we can vote on senators. By being aware of our representatives’ platform points and ideas regarding the spaces we live in and the infrastructure of California, we can make better-informed decisions to promote greener living. 
As Jane Jacobs, a writer and activist who transformed the ways we think about cities in her work “The Death and Life of Great American Cities,” said, “Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.”
Breanna de Vera is a junior writing about urban planning. Her column, “Where the Sidewalk Starts,” runs every other Monday.

At the end of August, BBCM, a brunch restaurant at USC Village, shut its doors. This closure came after a lawsuit filed by BBCM and Rance’s Chicago Pizza alleged that the University misled them about rent pricing and the use of dining dollars at USC Village. Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, USC Village has a newly vacant spot and needs another business to occupy the space. 
To fill the vacancy, the University should reach out to local businesses instead of chain restaurants to encourage more community involvement at USC. An integral part of this process will be lowering rent costs, at least initially, for these business owners and encouraging start-up proposals from the surrounding community as well as continuing to expand the University’s promise to train small businesses in the community.
Until 2017, the former University Village occupied the lot north of campus. The former Village contained sandwich shops, a movie theater and a grocery store. Rachel Will, a former USC student, wrote in L.A. Taco that it “was one of the few places around campus that also served the larger neighborhood, which shared it with sheltered USC students.” However, the new, higher-end chain businesses in USC Village have pushed out the mom-and-pop shops that once occupied the space with only one holdover from the past iteration: The Village Cobbler, a shoe repair store. 
Instead of accommodating students and community members equally, the focus has switched solely to students. These high-end shops and restaurants are dominated by student housing, strikingly different from the strip mall that used to occupy this space. When walking through USC Village, one sees more students walking to and from class than families stopping by for a meal out.
USC worked to combat cries of gentrification from the get-go by pledging more than $40 million in support of the community. An Annenberg Media special report from Feb. 22 of last year noted that, while the University exceeded its local hiring goals for construction, especially when building the firehouse just across the street from USC Village, it fell sorely behind on its promise to small businesses. The University agreed to provide development training for 40 small businesses, but in actuality, the program worked only with 14, and only one of them was considered local by the University’s own standards. Additionally, much of this money traveled far away from the community, reaching as far as Mesa, Ariz. If the University wants to hold true to its word, it should reinvest this money in the community. 
USC did attempt to help vendors relocate following the demolishment and reconstruction of USC Village, but it was not enough for most of the vendors to stay. The same Annenberg Media article found that USC paid a total of $342,000 in relocation assistance to 21 businesses. 
With even Rance’s Chicago Pizza, a Southern California chain, unable to turn a profit or make rent, it is easy to see that it would be difficult for a local business to afford rent at USC Village. To encourage these businesses to return or new businesses to relocate, the University must subsidize the rent for new businesses. The University is falling behind on many of its goals in regards to giving back to the community, so it should have no trouble picking up the slack.
In addition to helping out financially, the University should train new business owners from the community and provide them a space to set up shop. Along with giving back to the community, this would encourage more local residents to visit USC Village, making the space feel more open and accepting to them. Providing more affordable options through local businesses could also make USC Village seem less elitist and more accessible to all students and local residents.

Students at USC and colleges across the U.S. are faced with the same question: What are we going to do after we graduate? Teach for America seems like an appealing option for many: a temporary teaching opportunity in an under-resourced public school. However, there is a hefty price students pay for TFA’s reputable and glittering name on their resume. Before applying to any company, students need to do thorough research of its history and background.  
In 1989, Wendy Kopp, then a Princeton senior, wrote her undergraduate thesis about a program that would recruit recent graduates to teach in underserved schools across America. A year later, the nonprofit TFA launched and sent 489 corp members to underserved schools. It has since expanded, garnering nearly 60,000 alumni to date.
Its alumni profile is especially impressive, with 1,260 individuals serving as educational leaders and 171 former corps members serving in elected office. It also has special benefits for those applying to elite grad schools, ranging from application fee waivers to tuition discounts. But don’t let these qualities fool you. 
Each component of TFA — from its initial goal to its sizable outcome — seems laudable, but its history belies its very mission. 
The eligibility to apply to become a TFA corp member is simple: be a US citizen, legal resident or DACA-status college graduate with a minimum GPA of 2.5. Then, the recent graduates complete a five- to seven-week training program at an institute local to their assigned school. 
This has garnered criticism, particularly because TFA corp members are pushing out experienced teachers to temporarily replace them. 
One of the most infamous cases of this was in Louisiana in 2014, when the Louisiana Department of Education illegally fired 7,500 black teachers after Hurricane Katrina. This opened recruitment space for TFA corp members, whose number quadrupled in the region after Katrina. Although this may not be a direct cause and effect relation, this is a manifestation of powerful infrastructure displacing and robbing individuals of opportunities and livelihood. TFA should have been socially cognizant of the space it occupied; had it truly been an advocate for educational equity, it would have fought alongside the teachers who had been fired. 
TFA teachers’ fledgling experience and noncommittal devotion to teaching raise questions on how students are impacted academically. Multiple studies vary in result: Some cite that TFA teachers raised the students’ math scores while lowering their reading and verbal skills. 
These are only a handful among many backlashes against TFA. But these are the most pressing. How is the idealism of TFA, hailed as the “Hero Teacher Narrative,” impacting the real protagonists: the students themselves?
The Hero Teacher Narrative is similar to all the narratives of exceptionalism that preceded it. It’s one of optimism and reinforcement from others that affirm an opinionated stance. This is not to say that the individuals, particularly the corps members, are all culpable; there are those who acknowledge the privilege they come from and work to reconstruct to tell the real story. But if an organization’s own history stems from the epitome of the American educational system, the infrastructure that represents it can’t help but be founded within these same guiding principles.
TFA hasn’t turned a complete blind eye to these issues, although its aggressive marketing raises suspicions of coverups. It has acknowledged that its training program is insufficient teacher’s training and started a pilot initiative in 2014 to train its teachers during their senior year of college, extending its five-week program to a whole year. 
But this doesn’t serve as a pretext to all their shortcomings, and many exist beyond what this article covers. In that same grain, though, every corporation that recent graduates are heading into is rife with its own problems, too. Unfortunately, students cannot fix each and every one of those problems immediately. 
So students, the future workforce of the world, need to stay awake. Researching is tiresome, and it’s easy to be lured into reputable organizations like TFA for their connections and benefits. Soon-to-be graduates need to be made aware of TFA’s wrongdoings and remain vigilant if the organization that will bear their name is keeping its core promises to the American educational system. 
At the juncture of one of the most exciting and frightening moments for any college student — one’s post-graduate plans — each student needs to ask what each is willing to sacrifice: one’s wealth or one’s moral compass.

The summer before starting your first year at USC is full of plenty of emotions, goodbyes … and online classes. Students are assigned three online courses before arriving, one in-person course and the second half of Alcohol EDU online course to be completed during their first semester in order to access registration for the spring semester. These courses cover healthy alcohol use, sexual assault prevention and general campus safety. It is essential for students to receive information on these subjects before they are thrown into the college culture, but are these the best ways to engage students?
These online classes are a great start to addressing the problems of dangerous drinking habits and sexual assault, but students must sit through hours of these classes on their computers at home in an environment where they may not dedicate all of their attention to the online classes. These long hours are not conducive to the 18-year-old brain on summer vacation. Additionally, many students who plan to drink in college are most likely drinking over the summer as well, so they may be more dismissive of the issues presented by AlcoholEdu than those who plan to drink moderately or not at all. Alcohol may be a huge part of one’s college experience, and for this reason, thorough education on the subject is necessary to provide as safe of an environment on campus as possible. 
Instead of presenting many of these issues in courses taught by a computer, USC should invest in more on-campus resources for newly arriving students. Apart from the nightly festivities, incoming students do not have much to do during their Welcome Week. Of course students are meeting their peers, exploring the campus, venturing into Los Angeles and getting ready for their classes, but they are also experiencing USC’s campus culture for the first time. 
As they get familiar with campus and how they plan to engage it, the University should provide mandatory peer group sessions led by upperclassmen. These sessions would provide a voice for students from someone that has been in their position and has also learned from their experiences enough to help teach incoming students. Listening to peers may prove to be more engaging to students and would provide them with a place to discuss their perceptions of the culture they are expecting and the reality of arriving in a new place. 
These peer group sessions would also benefit from allowing students to hear from students who identify their gender in the same way, as stereotypes have their own way of engaging alcohol. Gender stereotypes associated with alcohol include stigma around heavy drinking, rape culture and hazing, each of which individuals will have to learn how to deal with personally. These sessions don’t necessarily have to stay strictly on the subject of alcohol, as so many things go along with it. Some of these related subjects include sexual assault, safety on campus, how to help struggling friends and finding the balance between having fun and studying. 
Creating peer groups with incoming freshmen from different residential colleges would also give students the benefit of meeting more people during Welcome Week. Additionally, the sessions would benefit from having more than one student leader to provide different perspectives from USC’s diverse student body. 
Though online courses have their time and place, assigning so many hours of redundant information is not an effective way to engage students. Though there should continue to be some required education on the subjects of safety, sexual assault and alcohol before classes start, providing more directed information and peer-led group sessions instead of long virtual scenarios would help students feel more knowledgeable about alcohol, comfortable in helping their friends and drinking safely if they choose to. These groups would be a great time for incoming students to get their questions answered, listen to advice and learn from others’ experiences.
