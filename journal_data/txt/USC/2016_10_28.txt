With Thursday’s 22-2 win over Claremont- Mudd- Scripps in the rear view mirror, the No. 3 ranked USC Men’s Water Polo team can now focus all of its attention towards Saturday’s clash against No. 2 Cal. 
The straight-forward victory served as an ideal tune-up for what is likely the most anticipated matchup of the season to this point.
The Trojans looked confident and focused throughout the dominating win over CMS. Two minutes in, junior Matteo Morelli began the scoring with a scorching long shot, his 100th career goal for USC. 
“I knew that I was missing only one goal before the game but I wasn’t looking forward to score,” Morelli said. “I’m definitely happy about it but I was more willing to make passes and willing to help other teammates score.”
He continued his special first quarter with two more goals over the span of two minutes. Just five minutes in, Morelli had secured a hat-trick that was key in establishing the offense. 
Morelli was not the only Trojan to hit the century mark. Fellow junior Grant Stein reached 100 goals in the second quarter and added one more in the final frame. Stein and Morelli joined leading scorer Blake Edwards as the men to reach 100 career goals this season. Freshmen standout Marin Dasic recorded a hat trick, while Nick Bell, Zach D’Sa and James Walters all added two goals themselves. The scoring onslaught amounted to two 7-goal quarters and the seventh time this season that the Trojans have eclipsed 20 goals in a game.
Goaltender McQuin Baron provided his standard excellence in goal recording seven saves and captaining a defense that conceded just two goals, the second lowest allowed all season. Freshman goalie Simon Wu replaced him in the fourth period and added two saves himself. 
Despite the ease at which the Men of Troy were able to score, the game was coached as if it were a close contest. Coach Jovan Vavic criticized Morelli’s assist to Blake Edwards in the third quarter — resulting in USC’s 15th goal — calling it, “not a very good pass.” 
Then in the fourth quarter, Vavic called a timeout with four minutes left and a 17th goal lead in hand. One of the lighter moments of the game came when Vavic asked a player how he could have possibly been tired from sitting on the bench. 
Vavic’s intense, perfectionist style of coaching will become much more vital during Saturday’s game against Cal, when his team will likely not be able to score with the same frequency or ease as they have in recent contests. The last time the two powerhouses met was in September at the Mountain Pacific Invitational, where the Bears handed the Trojans their only loss of the season; a 10-8 nail biter at Berkley. Cal is now 15-2 with both losses to the undefeated UCLA. Saturday, the Men of Troy get to face the #2 team in the nation at their house, as they look to even the score. 
“We are so excited,” Moreli said on Saturday’s game. “We lost the last game we played against Cal so we are ready to take our revenge. It’s going to be one of the most important games of the season so we are really ready, prepared and excited to play this game.” 
The matchup will start at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center and will be televised on the Pac-12 Network.

This year marks my second year living alone. To some people, the words “living alone” might seem scary, but I’m here to tell you why going “solo dolo” could be the next best decision you make. It worked out for Beyonce and trust me, it can work out for you too. 
My college living journey began with me moving into a suite-style dorm my freshman year with seven other girls. Now if you have sisters or are a girl yourself, I’m sure you all just imagined miscellaneous makeup and hair products flooding a small bathroom counter, a mess of clothes and shoes thrown on a shared living room couch, and just a hot mess in general. All of this is a somewhat accurate depiction of my living situation during that year of my life. 
As someone who very much enjoys her own space and takes pride in having a clean place to come home to, living with half a dozen other girls was quite a challenge for me. Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t trade the memories we shared for anything. I think in a way that was exactly what I needed as an 18-year-old entering a totally new world — an immediate support group. You also suddenly have a couple more closets to choose from and there is always an on-demand going-out crew to roll with, a study group to review with, or people to vent to at the end of your day. But as you get older, that friend group becomes more of a VIP area at the club, not a general admission concert. 
The next year I chose to live in a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with the same roommate, one of our suitemates and a friend of hers. As someone who is especially particular about the vibe of my living area (minimum of three candles lit at a time, at least one motivational quote on display, and a freezer always stocked with hot pockets), sharing a room oftentimes drove me insane. With three roommates who were in sororities, and me not being in one, our extracurricular schedules were a bit different. While we had our fair share of fun late nights as a group, Wine Wednesdays became the bane of my 8:00am Thursday class. 
Living with roommates can be the best of times and the worst of times. While you always come home to a familiar face, you might sometimes come home to your leftovers eaten, dirty dishes, and your new shoes worn with a “Borrowed these last night. Hope you don’t mind” note.
And that’s how I ended up in my own studio apartment. My first year living alone was both the most magical and the most lonely. I loved every second of having an apartment all to myself. I could do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted (clothing optional). It was the definition of zen. But, living alone can have an effect on people. You happily sip your wine and watch your shows, and before you know it, you haven’t left your apartment or hung out with your friends in weeks. This made me realize how much I missed the convenience of having my closest friends right there when I lived with them, but it also prompted me to start making more plans to connect and maintain the friendships that mattered to me.  
Sometimes being alone is the best way to get to know yourself. Living alone teaches you how to be the most independent version of yourself — a version that can cook, clean, and even fix a maintenance problem you never knew you could. So to anyone considering getting their own place, DO IT!

About a week ago, I was sitting in McDonald’s (A.K.A. MacDo) writing an essay. One thing I clearly remember was the various music being played in the loudspeaker. I heard music sung in Hindi, English, Arabic and Spanish all within a span of an hour. 
McDonald’s — which is really good here, by the way — is seen as a “Western” establishment in Morocco. Tourists and locals flock here to eat the noteable McChicken or savor a sweet McFlurry. I overheard people ordering in Darija, French, Arabic, Spanish, English, and more. Listening and seeing such diversity within MacDo reaffirmed my previous observations and reflections made on how diverse Morocco really is. 
What I’ve learned is that most Moroccans know at least three languages minimum. They know the languages spoken in their house, in school, at work, and on the streets. These languages range from native Amazigh (which has many dialects), Darija (colloquial Moroccan tongue), French (spoken in business and school), and Fusha (classical Arabic that is taught in school). Due to colonization and increased tourism from Europe, many Moroccans know Spanish and English as well.
It is fascinating to see how fluid languages are here; I have found myself speaking Fusha, Darija and French in one sentence because I have learned basic words in each language. Ninety-nine percent of the menus here are written in French, which has made learning it much easier. If I’m ordering chicken pizza, I say, “Ana bgheet pizza poulet.” Within that one sentence, I have spoken Darija, English, and French.
When you finally understand the French menu
My Moroccan language partner loves Pakistani soap operas and Bollywood movies and has learned Hindi and Urdu through watching films. Growing up and attending public school in the U.S., there was no real emphasis on learning languages; English is universal. In my hometown, a foreign language wasn’t taught until high school and language class was seen as one that people slacked off in.
However, attending USC — a private school where at least 17% of students are international — I have come to appreciate the linguistic diversity of the world. Studying abroad has furthered my appreciation of language because in other countries like Morocco, linguistic diversity is just embedded in their social culture and people don’t think twice about seeing foreigners.
However, being a person of color living in Morocco, I am in a strange situation where I am seen as a foreigner, but considered a resident (at least temporarily). I pass by the same shops every day, know my way around the city and sleep in a Moroccan home every night.
Like any society, there are preconceived notions and judgements about other ethnicities based on skin color. When I tell Moroccans that I am American, most of them do not believe me because I am darker skinned and look like I am from Pakistan. I do not want to make overarching generalizations, nor do I wish to speak for the people of Morocco, but from what I have witnessed and heard from my Moroccan friends is that their general perception of Americans are fair-skinned people who look more European. However, my American friends here who are fair-skinned are constantly mistaken for European, especially French, because of the proximity of the country and the large amount of French nationals who reside in Morocco.
One’s ethnic background and family name are very important here. People use that to identify one’s social and economic class. There have been many instances where I am ordering food at a restaurant and before I can finish my sentence, I am asked if I am Indian. “Hindiya?” they say, and I respond with “Ana amreekeeya” – I am American. Then they say no, you must be something else too, and then I tell them I am Pakistani-American. The first couple of times this happened, I couldn’t help but feel offended. Why did they have to know my nationality? What does this have to do with me ordering food? I have gotten used to these questions about race and realized that if you look like a foreigner, no matter what skin color you are, people will ask where you are from.
Maybe they are asking me because they are excited to see foreigners here, but it is hard to come up with a conclusion without some sort of ignorant judgment. Just as they are trying to figure me out, I am doing the same with them. What is their perception of Pakistanis? I know in other MENA countries, South Asian people work as caretakers or maids for upper class families.
Maybe I get offended because race and ethnicity is somewhat of a sensitive topic in my Southern Californian college bubble, where social activism diversity is so celebrated, debated, and emphasized. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve also been asked where I am from in America way too many times to count. I say my parents are from Pakistan, because they are, and that I was born in America, which I was. 
With some of my study abroad friends
Everything here is racialized, even street harassment. I have a couple of South Asian friends in my abroad program and when we walk the streets together, we are called “coffee” and “chocolate” or just straight up “Hindiya.” What does calling me Indian achieve? Nothing. But putting a racial label on me somehow reaffirms my status as a foreign person of color living in a country where the general population would be considered “PoC” in America.
My Arabic professor thinks “back home” is Pakistan for me, which I have corrected him is not. I am extremely proud of being Pakistani and unapologetic about my heritage, but to be honest, I have only been to Pakistan once, and that was 11 years ago. California is home to me and if I do go to Pakistan again, I will feel like a foreigner for sure. It’s like that hyphen metaphor you hear all the time:  I am too American to be Pakistani and too Pakistani to be American. This has made me reevaluate societal judgments and what people see me as. I have never felt so insecure about my skin color than I have here in Morocco. 
Maybe because I don’t really see color when I am meeting a new person in America. I was raised in a culturally diverse neighborhood and attended culturally diverse schools growing up. I find it rude asking someone where they are from the first time I meet them, because I like to get to know them first before I fall into the trap of making racial judgments or preconceived notions about them.
But sometimes I feel like I am stuck in an American bubble in Morocco. I can relate to the American friends I’ve made in my program on many levels, but their experiences are the same, yet different from mine. The general consensus we’ve made is that white foreigners are treated different than foreigners of color in better and worse ways.
For example, my South Asian-American friend told me that her and a white friend both ordered a coffee to go. The employee at the counter poured the sugar and stirred it in the coffee and closed the top for her white friend. For my South Asian friend, he just gave her the sugar packets and the unlidded the coffee, expecting her to pour it in herself. Now this may seem like a miniscule incident that may not even cross one’s mind, but this can also be seen as an act of microaggression, assuming that because my friend is a person of color or looks Moroccan, she doesn’t need that extra care. I have been through both situations; they have poured sugar for me and they have given it to me to mix it in myself.
Racism, gender, ethnicity, culture, etc. are all large, complex, and nuanced issues that elicit different experiences from each individual. I’ve experienced two extremes in Morocco: unimaginable hospitality from complete strangers and blatant racism and altered treatment because of my skin color. How I’m treated by strangers can either make or break my day, but I’ve learned to expect the unexpected. I have less than two months left here and I am stuck in a weird stage where I am ready, yet unready to return home — and yet, Rabat has become my home away from home.

Alexandra Ting | Daily TrojanHome sweet home · Junior setter Reni Meyer-Whalley and the No. 24 Women of Troy have two home games before they take a long road trip.
After a quick victory over Cal and an equally quick defeat at the hands of Stanford last week, the women’s volleyball team looks to duplicate their first game and fix the mistakes of their second in order to come away with two victories this weekend before heading back on the road for the next four games. 
The No. 24 Women of Troy (14-7, 6-4) first face No. 21 Utah (15-6, 6-4) on Friday before playing Colorado (12-8, 4-6) on Saturday.
“They are hungry to get back out on the court and show themselves that they can play a lot better than they finished on last Sunday,” head coach Mick Haley said. “There is nobody more disappointed about not being able to play better than our team, but they are not going to quit. They are going to come back with a vengeance.”
The Trojans have not been able to win back-to-back home games since their final preseason tournament in September. However, they hold a 16-2 record against the Utes and a perfect 13-0 record against the Buffs.
“We have been fortunate to have wins,” Haley said. “But they are teams that we certainly look to come in here and play well. You have to take these teams as if they are in first place because in this conference, the minute you overlook somebody they come in and beat you. You need to respect your opponents.”
Utah will be led by junior outside hitter Adora Anae. The last time the Trojans played the Utes, Anae had 25 kills and 12 digs, which heavily contributed to the five close sets USC had to overcome before their final victory.
“Utah has a great player in Anae,” Haley said. “She is just fun to watch, even when she is against your own team. We want to do a good job slowing her down.”
The game against Utah will allow the team a chance to turn around from their disappointing loss to Stanford and show that they are continually learning and improving as the season goes on.
“They just wanted to perform better against Stanford,” Haley said. “When they didn’t, they were a little unsure as to why they couldn’t do better. Once we showed them what happened in certain situations, I think they got the picture that they really could do this without a problem, but that they just have to kick it up in certain areas.”
In order to come out victorious this weekend, Haley said the Trojans will have to keep errors down, serve strong, pass well and give the middles more opportunities to score. 
“We need to do what we do best,” Haley said. “If we can do those things, then we can get a little momentum going into this road trip.”
After these home games, the Women of Troy will only have two of their eight remaining games at Galen Center. With this, the Trojans want to use these home games to rest and prepare for their road trips, but build up an intensity to take with them as well.
“There is a lot of season left,” Haley said. “There is the whole second half of the conference. If we could go 10-0 in that, we have a chance to win, so we want to get back into the hunt.”
The Women of Troy will take on Utah Friday at 8 p.m. and Colorado on Saturday at 5 p.m. at the Galen Center.
Post mortem, team was literally pathetic after the first OT set which they somehow won. Lose 25 – 10 in second set
was one of the worst performance witnessed in last almost twenty years. Coaching did nothing at intermission to change
strategy to give team a lift. Back court was slow , and out of position most of the match. Big help needed in the middle for
next season with loss of Ruddins. Major coup in recruiting a must.
One of the problems is that the WOT don’t have a great player or real leader this season. Laugh at Coach Haley saying
the team has to keep errors to a minimum, serve strong, pass well, and go to the middle more. The coaching staff has
had twenty one matches to get that across to the players. They need two wins at home this weekend or chances of
making the tournament are slim and none.

From the first time that sophomore running back Ronald Jones II touched the ball on Thursday, the air in the Coliseum turned electric. 
He sprinted 61 yards in his first carry, dodging defenders and dishing out straight-arms until a cornerback dragged him out of bounds at the 27 yard-line. Six plays later, redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold threw his first touchdown, taking a 7-0 lead and setting the tone for the night.
By the numbers alone, the game was the Ronald Jones show. He broke his own season best in the first half, notching 154 yards in eight carries and picking up an average of 19.3 yards every time Darnold handed him the ball. By the final whistle, he ran for 223 yards, almost twice as many rushing yards as the entirety of the Cal offense.
“We just knew we were going to have to pick up the slack tonight,” Jones said. “Great work from the offensive line all night. The receivers, just everyone came together tonight.”
With six touchdowns and 629 yards of offense, the 45-24 victory over Cal proved that the Trojans’ versatility is their greatest threat. Darnold found four different receivers in the endzone for five touchdowns, with Jones rushing in the second of the night. And seven players carried the ball for 398, with sophomore Aca’Cedric Ware gashing the Bears’ defense for 130 yards on the night. With versatility in every snap, the Cal defense was flustered and unable to slow the pace.
“Be prepared for next year because it’s going to be a show,” Ware said in reference to his performance alongside Jones, which resulted in a combined 353 yards.
Meanwhile, Darnold showed a marked patience in the pocket. In the second quarter, he took a few extra seconds and a few extra steps until sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett flashed his hands to provide the perfect target to thread yet another touchdown pass. 
Darreus Rogers catches a slant for a touchdown in Thursday night’s win over Cal – Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
He lobbed arcing passes to senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers and stutter-stepped around a defender to sling the ball up the middle to redshirt freshman Daniel Imatorbhebhe. He carved up the secondary with play-action passes, then scrambled to convert when his pocket dissolved. 
His performance caused USC alum and former NFL wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson to tweet, “I’m telling you Sam will [be] the best to ever play the position at this rate. And I’m talking pro ready.”
Much of the team’s success came from their swagger, a tangible confidence that added an extra punch to every play. The Trojans thrived in the home environment. Jackson grinned and posed for the jumbotron after breaking the school’s record for return yards. Rogers earned a penalty for his fiery celebration after his second touchdown, spinning the ball in the endzone and roaring at the crowd.
And when the Coliseum blasted “JuJu On That Beat” during a commercial break, junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster danced in the middle of the field, rousing the entire student section onto their feet.
That confidence was felt on both sides. From the first snap, the defense took every opportunity to drill Cal quarterback Davis Webb in the pocket and forced two dropped passes in the first two drives. That pressure continued, and with only 10 points in the first half, the Bears looked nothing like their typical high-scoring, high-octane selves. 
“I’m extremely proud of the way our defense played tonight,” head coach Clay Helton said. “To hold that offense to 75 plays was huge for us.”
But despite the dominant final score, the game was also marred by mistakes. 
Though he threw for five of the game’s six touchdowns — his second straight game with five or more touchdowns — Darnold fumbled twice in the first half. Both mistakes happened in dangerous defensive territory, and resulted in a touchdown and a field goal for Cal. Darnold cleaned up his hands in the second half, but threw an interception in the fourth quarter, continuing the turnover trend that has plagued the young quarterback all season.
“I’m getting used to all of the pressure now,” Darnold said. “As you play college football, you’re going to get used to it. I think just every level that you go through you’re going to experience some growing pains. I’m dealing with it now and I’m going to keep dealing with it.”
Defensively, the Trojans gave up 125 yards of penalties, at one point ceding 30 yards on back-to-back facemask penalties in the first quarter. Though these moments of sloppiness didn’t take their toll on the Trojans, they exposed areas of weakness that Helton will need to patch up for future conference play.
But for a Trojan team rebounding from a rocky start to the season, the night’s victory and the move to a 5-3 record created a much-needed boost in the team’s status in the Pac-12, and in their confidence approaching the final third of the season.
“We’re just playing good football,” Helton said. “We’re playing together. We had a couple mistakes tonight …  But they’re playing as a unit. They’re really gelling and I think there’s a lot of confidence out there.”

On USC’s first play from scrimmage, sophomore running back Ronald Jones II took a handoff at his own 12-yard line, ran right by four Cal defenders who parted like the Red Sea, sprinted past two more, broke the tackle of another and then ran untouched for about 45 more yards before being caught. 
Three minutes later, the Trojans jumped ahead 7-0, and viewers on the East Coast could probably have turned off their televisions and gone to bed before 11 p.m. 
OK, maybe Ronald Jones isn’t Moses. But he did open the floodgates for a blowout at the Coliseum as the Trojans beat the Bears 45-24 on Thursday night. 
USC jumped all over Cal from the get-go. Jones looked like Reggie Bush on some of his carries, slipping and sliding defenders all over the field, as the Bears’ porous rushing defense — worst in the Pac-12 — had no answer for the sophomore. By halftime, USC had basically a full game’s worth of offense with four touchdowns on 451 yards; 260 on the ground and 191 in the air. Jones was on pace for nearly 300 yards at halftime, averaging 18.6 yards a carry. 
“He had a fire under him,” head coach Clay Helton said on Jones. 
Even sophomore running back Aca’cedric Ware, backing up Jones, had a career-high 86 yards rushing at the half.
In the air, redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold and Co. also had their way. Darnold again zipped around the field, throwing, running and sometimes doing both at the same time. His five touchdown passes came with little resistance — an easy three-yard slant to senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers here, a screen pass for Jones to walk into the end zone there. His play action fake to set up a 17-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open redshirt freshman tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe in the third quarter sealed the deal, and gave him his second consecutive five touchdown game. 
You can make the case that Cal was tired, having played six days before in a double-overtime marathon against Oregon and traveling to the Coliseum — trust me, Bears’ head coach Sonny Dykes made sure everyone knew that in the days leading up to the game. You can make the case that any half-decent team could have dropped 45 points on the board against Cal, which annually sacrifices any semblance of defense for an above-average offense — call it the “Dykes Special,” if you will.
So give credit to USC for pummeling an opponent it should have pummeled, for using a bye-week to adequately prepare, for taking advantage of a rough patch in the schedule for Cal. 
Give Jones kudos for finding his groove after struggling to start the year, finally resembling the freshman phenom that had so much promise as the next product of “Tailback U.” His 37-yard touchdown run in the third quarter to give USC a 35-17 lead reminded fans of just how good he is, as “RoJo” stutter-stepped, bided his time and then erupted with a power burst to glide into the end zone untouched.
It took an injury to senior running back Justin Davis, but this was the Jones we all expected to see. And likewise, it took a courageous decision by Helton to hand over the starting quarterback job to a redshirt freshman, but this was finally the USC team we expected to see. 
Mired in quicksand with a 1-3 start, the Trojans have no one but Darnold to thank for pulling them back up from laughingstock to a respectable team. They were a play away from beating Utah, defeated Arizona State soundly, survived Colorado, blew out Arizona and now took care of Cal. In a stretch of five games they absolutely must win to keep their Pac-12 Championship hopes alive, the Trojans are four-fifths of the way there, with just lowly Oregon left next week.
But despite the spark provided by Darnold, the four-game win streak and the above .500 record, the recent success seems more like a grace period for Helton than a time for congratulations. USC has found a quarterback, salvaged its season and earned Helton the right to keep his job until 2017 — but that’s all this stretch has accomplished. If I told you before the season that those would be the only positive results, would you be satisfied? 
At USC, the answer will always be “no.” An upset of Washington, a win over rivals UCLA and Notre Dame and a return to the Pac-12 Championship Game may sway some opinions. For now, a Thursday night win over a tired Cal team with an abominable defense will suffice, but it’s hardly the end game.
