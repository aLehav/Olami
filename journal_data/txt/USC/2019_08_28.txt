Writing this column every other week won’t be easy for me. Mental health is a deeply personal topic for me, and my journey with it is, at best, turbulent. But because it’s so personal, I also consider it to be urgent and important. 
I’m taking a risk with “On My Mind.” I know I’ll constantly struggle to find the right words to talk about mental wellness, whether because I fear judgment or because it’s hard to discuss aspects of myself I probably will never fully understand. 
But I also know discussing mental health is powerful. The myriad stigmas surrounding mental health are only strengthened by silence, so if my experience can help break down those walls and encourage people to be more conscious of their own minds, it’s worth spending the time and energy to find the right words. 
In our first issue of the school year last week, the Daily Trojan announced its new wellness initiative — a program led by Wellness Director Natalie Bettendorf and myself to prevent burnout and maintain the well-being of our staff, as well as to improve and grow our coverage of mental health within the USC community. 
This column is part of that increased coverage. Throughout the semester, I’ll discuss my own experiences dealing with depression and anxiety, the practices and resources I’ve used for support and the ways in which conversation and action around mental health needs to be better, both in the USC community and more broadly. 
However, this column isn’t just for people dealing with mental illnesses or just about those illnesses. Wellness is about much more: It’s about dealing with stress before a major test; it’s about handling relationships — with romantic partners, friends, family — and the confusion that comes with them; it’s about taking care of ourselves in small ways, like getting enough sleep or improving time management. 
Many people disregard opportunities to improve their wellness because they feel like it doesn’t apply to them — that mental health is something that only people who are struggling much more have to think about. This narrative is dangerous because it prevents individuals from seeking help for problems that they consider less pressing and from practicing self-care as a preventative measure for their well-being. 
It’s helpful to think of mental health in terms of physical health. Most people see a dentist at least once or twice a year, just to keep their teeth clean and make sure they don’t have any larger problems with their dental health. They also brush their teeth twice a day, to keep them clean and healthy. 
Most people don’t go to the dentist or brush their teeth because they already have a cavity or because their teeth hurt — they do it as a preventative measure, to make sure they don’t get a cavity in the first place. 
In many ways, mental health is similar to dental health. Certainly, you should see a specialist if you’re feeling pain or know there is something wrong with your health. But simple measures like brushing teeth should be a daily practice. 
For mental health, that means incorporating self-care into everyday life. Just like brushing teeth, it doesn’t have to be complicated or take more than 5 minutes out of the day. It can take many forms — a self-guided meditation every morning, taking the time to declutter and reorganize your desk or room every few weeks or simply going for a walk every evening to clear your mind. 
Similarly, you can see a professional about your mental health, even if you don’t feel like you have a major issue. Therapists and counselors can help identify opportunities for growth in your personal and professional life that’ll make you feel happier and more secure, and they can prevent destructive situations or behaviors in your life from becoming major problems started as minor annoyances. 
It’s about being mindful — being conscious of your brain as a body part like any other that you have to check in on every so often. It can be tricky because the mind is invisible and enigmatic, but it’s vital to take care of it. 
I hope everyone can benefit from this column by applying mindfulness and self-care to their own lives and by learning more about how mental health affects them, no matter the state of their well-being.

Every year, USC welcomes transfer students from institutions worldwide, making up nearly 30% of the Fall 2018 class. That means 30% of these students were not guaranteed on-campus housing. An essential part of a student’s first year at a new university — as a freshman or as a transfer student — the opportunity to socialize with peers and get familiarized with the campus. This is why guaranteed on-campus housing for transfer students is essential: Without it, acclimating to a new environment would prove to be difficult. 
Housing for transfer students can be interpreted as a game of filling in the blanks: Wherever a bed may be available, a transfer student may be offered one. This tactic may be strategic for providing transfer students with on-campus housing, but it may be difficult for them to thrive. Chances are that transfer students are blindly placed with the roommates and suitemates for at least a year, which unfairly places transfer students at a socializing handicap. Cohabitants have already established friend groups while the transfer student is barely beginning to create those bonds. Further, it may be difficult for them to bond, since being a transfer student proves to be such a unique experience. Afterall, they are starting fresh in the middle of their college career, which may force them to end their old connections at their prior institutions for new ones at their new school. 
Having on-campus apartment-style housing for transfer students is ideal. You’d get the ability to live in an apartment and learn to become a functioning young adult. Having this in an apartment-style building and environment allows transfers to begin to get used to cooking for themselves with the cushion of 40 dining hall swipes per semester. Transfers have either lived at home with family or in dorms before transferring, both of which don’t offer as many responsibilities. 
On-campus apartments can ease transfer students from dorm-style housing they may have lived in before to an environment where they have more responsibilities to tend to. Having an entire apartment complex — or at least a couple of floors — available for transfer students to live in would foster a greater sense of community. A circle of transfers may ease the social curve of being a transfer. Transfers can bond over having to take more general education requirements and figuring out the best places to study around campus. Additionally, you’d have a group of friends to go to events with as you get a feel for the new campus culture. 
This year, USC Housing made it possible for transfers to apply for freshman residential colleges. This may seem intuitive as both transfers and freshmen are attending USC for the first time. However, it holds transfer students back. Instead of allowing them to transition to more young-adult, independent responsibilities, they’re living like freshmen again.
Consider a cost-benefit analysis of freshman dorms versus off-campus apartments through the lens of a transfer student. A benefit of living in a freshman dorm is the convenience of living on campus, in walking distance of libraries, classes and campus events. However, the cost of living in on-campus freshman dorms is the lack of independence. Since freshmen dorms don’t have kitchens, they rely on dining halls for their meals. This removes the opportunity for a transfer student — who is a few years older — to learn how to not rely on access to dining halls and instead learn to cook for themselves.
A benefit of living off-campus in non-USC Housing apartments is the opportunity to function as an independent adult. In this form of housing, students are not required to get a meal plan. Instead, they’re able to learn how to be a young adult by buying groceries, cooking food for themselves regularly, paying rent monthly (maybe through their own income) and budgeting. A cost of living in this form of housing is the lack of a sense of community. Without being able to go down the hall and knock on the door of a fellow transfer, they’re unable to live in a community of their peers who may empathize better with being new to a university but already having college experience and all that comes with being a transfer student. This prevents them from finding an easily accessible community of fellow transfer students. 
Transfer students should be around fellow transfers as they have similar experiences. Some are going to school away from home for the first time. For this reason, on-campus housing should be guaranteed to help transfer students thrive in their new environment with others who are going through similar experiences while learning to become more independent.

In a 1995 study published in Psychological Review, researcher Mahzarin Banaji, who said she did not consider herself racist, was astounded and humiliated to discover she couldn’t perform a task associating positive adjectives with Black faces as easily as she could for white faces. In the early 2000s, economist Marianne Bertrand conducted a study in which she sent out more than 1,300 job applications with different names, and she found that Black-sounding names received 50% fewer job interviews than traditionally white names. 
Today, police brutality is a leading cause of death for Black men. In fact, one in 1,000 Black men is killed in violent altercations with police officers, which is 2.5 times higher than for white men. All of these cases are manifestations of implicit racial bias, a phenomenon coined in the late 1990s by Banaji, though such a phenomenon persisted far longer.
An issue that has stubbornly persisted for so long inevitably raises questions as to why progress has been so slow. The neurological basis of racism can shed some clarity on this question and offer insight on how we can overcome implicit bias.
The brain operates on two systems of thinking, depending on the type of information that is taken in. One system performs quick, automatic processing, while the other system is slow, deliberate and requires conscious effort. Generally, the faster system handles emotionally driven input. Unfortunately, racial bias falls under that category. 
Research has shown that the amygdala, the part of the brain that deals with fear, plays a central role in forming and reacting to racial bias. This rapid, instinctive processing of racial prejudice explains why Banaji was so quick to select negative words for pictures of Black faces, why employers are more likely to dismiss job applications with Black-sounding names and why police officers are faster to pull the trigger when confronting a Black person. Simply put, deep-rooted racial biases come to mind before any rational thinking can take place. 
Because they pop up automatically, we are not cognizant of them. Understanding the neural mechanisms that dictate the way we think about race can encourage everyone to question their gut reactions and override them with rational thinking.
It is also important to address the “how” and the “why” of these implicit biases. Despite the subconscious nature of implicit racism, it is not inherent — instead, it is learned. Unfortunately, today’s society paints an unfavorable picture for underrepresented  groups. An experiment by researchers at Tufts University found that the brain is so keen to pick up on race-based associations that even on-screen body language without sound is enough for people to form assumptions about different races. 
On a neurological level, repeated exposure to the same information, like racist stereotypes, chemically strengthens the connection between adjacent neurons that fire together to process that information. This process, called long-term potentiation, or memory formation, shows that over time, neurons that have undergone LTP are more likely to fire together, meaning it becomes easier to recall repeated information.
As the brain learns negative associations for discriminated groups, the amygdala begins to respond to those groups as a survival instinct, albeit a very misguided one. The amygdala’s induced response ranges from developing a negative “gut feeling” based on race to triggering a full-fledged threat response to someone perceived as dangerous. These responses shape the implicit biases that infiltrate all aspects of society to establish the deeply entrenched system of institutional racism that exists today. 
In this digital age that exposes people to large quantities of information so rapidly, racist rhetoric is more harmful than ever, especially considering the severity of its neurological impact. It is imperative for the media, public figures and people in general to change the narrative surrounding discriminated groups to weaken and eventually eliminate this misguided survival instinct. 
Because racial bias is learned, it can be unlearned. Through repeated exposure to stimuli perceived as averse in non-threatening environments, the brain can unlearn fear-driven associations, including racism. In addition to fighting individual prejudice, the neurological basis of racism can be applied to combat racism structurally. For example, incorporating these neurological principles into reforming police officer training could be instrumental in overhauling the existing racist justice system. Doing so will require significant change on both an individual and societal level, but being cognizant of one’s own bias is the first step to making that change.

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Jack Sears announced Tuesday that he was entering the transfer portal. Sears lost the competition for the starting job to sophomore JT Daniels, who head coach Clay Helton named USC’s signal-caller Aug. 20.
Sears announced his decision in a written statement on Twitter. In the accompanying tweet, Sears wrote that the purpose of the announcement was to “clarify the situation and avoid speculation.” He will be staying at the University through the semester.
“The past week has been a difficult time, a bump in the road, and it makes me realize that life is not linear,” Sears wrote.
Sears also stated he will continue to train and work out. He told Helton he is available if the team needs him. 
“I ask guys to do three things: Compete, give absolute best effort and graduate from this University,” Helton said at Tuesday night’s practice. “Jack has done all three in a first-class manner. He is part of my family for life, and I wish him nothing but the best in the future. He is a special, special individual.”
Sears’ entry into the transfer portal allows him to have contact with coaches and team officials from other universities while he is still enrolled at USC. 
“I love my teammates, football, USC and the USC degree,” he wrote. “Nobody can ever take that degree away from me. I am proud of the work that I put in on and off the field, the way I competed and how I have comported myself.”
Sears played in one game as a Trojan, starting in a 38-35 loss to Arizona State at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum last season with Daniels and Matt Fink out due to injuries. Sears completed 20 of 28 passes for 235 yards and two touchdowns in the contest.
Sears was a 4-star recruit out of San Clemente High School in the class of 2017. He committed to USC in November 2016 after decommitting from Duke. He enrolled in January 2017. 
Helton named freshman Kedon Slovis as Daniels’ backup, followed on the depth chart by redshirt junior Fink. 
The Trojans will kick off the 2019 season against Fresno State at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Coliseum.

Junior Becca Mann became the first swimmer to finish the Triple Maui Nui Channel Swim Aug. 19. Mann, a former USC swimmer who turned pro last August, completed the historic swim in 20 hours and 53 minutes.
The Triple Maui Nui Channel Swim is a daunting 39.64 mile triangular route which begins at Maui and proceeds to Molokai, Lanai and then back to Maui. Although the swim’s distance far exceeds that of Mann’s usual competitive swims, the 10-kilometer open water event and the mile, Mann did not change her training regimen.
“For this event, I just went into it,” Mann said. “I didn’t know how to train for it. I don’t even know how you can train for 20 hours … I knew that my body could do it because it was just one day of my life, and I’d spent so many hours in the water just training and pushing myself. I knew that I could physically do it; it was just going to be a matter of mentally conquering it.”
Despite the grueling nature of the swim, Mann said that for her, swimming distance feels less like a job and more like an adventure. Her swimming experience dates back to when she was 5 years old, when she ignored her parent’s concerns about pool safety and attended her sister’s swim class without permission.
“[My parents] were driving her to the practice, and I packed my bag and snuck in with her and joined the swim team, and I just never looked back,” Mann said. “I love swimming so much, the idea of my goals and reaching for them and challenging myself. It really allows me to push myself as far as I can go.”
While Mann put in countless hours at the pool to physically prepare for the swim, she was surprised by the mental challenge it presented. The strong current, especially during the second stint from Molokai to Lanai, slowed her down tremendously and made her uncertain as to how much ground she could cover within each hour.
“[From Molokai to Lanai], I was swimming three times less than my normal speed,” Mann said. “So I was only going 500 meters every 20 minutes, and normally I can do 1.5 kilometers per 20 minutes, so that part was a real challenge. Just knowing that I was still 10 kilometers away [from the end], which I can normally do in two hours but would take me seven hours this time, was really hard to get through.”
Since the event was Mann’s first swim at night in open water, she was able to experience the beauty of the nature surrounding her in a new way. The water grew progressively darker as she swam, and Mann was mesmerized by the phosphorescent light that appeared each time she took a stroke.
“When it was totally dark, I turned onto my back and did some backstroke, and the stars were the brightest I’d ever seen because the moon hadn’t risen yet,” Mann said. “And it was just pitch black with all these glistening stars, and I felt like I could touch them because they were so bright and so close.”
Mann said she wants to take on the channel swim again one day, but she isn’t sure what else the future has in store for her in regard to swimming. Although she came up short at the qualifying event for the 10-kilometer race in next year’s Olympic Games, Mann qualified for the upcoming pool Olympic trials and is still deciding whether she will compete. After taking a year off from school to train for the Olympics, Mann has resumed her studies at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts as a screenwriting major. 
Mann also harbors an interest in fundraising and aims to donate excess funds from each swim to organizations like the Navy Seal Foundation. 
Mann created a GoFundMe page to raise funds for the paddlers, management and equipment required to ensure her safety during the swim. Although she was unable to raise excess funds this time around, Mann hopes to continue to raise awareness about the organization and its mission to keep the oceans clean through her platform as a professional swimmer.
Whether she continues on to the Olympic trials or focuses on her studies, Mann hopes to continue to push herself to new heights both in and out of the water.

Undergraduate Student Government President Trenton Stone announced in a Senate meeting Tuesday that Trojan Council will host a University Forum open to students at the end of the semester.
Trojan Council, a group of four USC governing bodies, is currently in its formalizing stages and hopes to host its first ever University Forum at the end of the semester. Formed in 2017, Trojan Council is composed of Academic Senate, Staff Assembly, Graduate Student Government and Undergraduate Student Government. Formal objectives of the group include working with both students and administration to discuss campus issues in an effort to resolve them. 
“We have a forum where people are allowed to ask questions, speak of issues that are affecting them or the community and really just raise issues and have a dialogue about it,” said Stone.
Previously, meetings with the Trojan Council were only open to the governing bodies’ presidents and vice presidents. While students could ask to present their concerns to the Council, both Stone and the USG Senate hope that the University Forum will provide more accessibility to students.
Although Trojan Council wasn’t previously institutionalized by USC or any of the participating groups, each governing body passed a resolution to reaffirm their organizational support. Stone hopes that the creation of the University Forum will help establish a lasting legacy for Trojan Council.
The University Forum will invite students, staff and faculty to attend a discussion with University President Carol Folt, Provost Charles Zukoski and Vice President for Human Resources Felicia Washington. This will allow students to have the space and resources to ask and resolve questions about issues affecting their community.
“Right now we’re planning that [forum] for later in the semester and then the other thing that we’re doing is just working on formalizing Trojan Council to make sure that it will stay long-term and to just really figure out of what the Trojan Council looks like,” Stone said.
The headline of this article was updated Aug. 28 at 9:20 p.m. to reflect the correct number of  public meetings that will be held each semester.

Mahima Varanasi has always been a fan of politics. For her 17th birthday, her high school friends bought her a shirt with a photo of former Vice President Joe Biden eating an ice cream cone — a gag gift she has come to cherish.
So, when Varanasi, a sophomore majoring in computer science, was given the chance to spend her summer in Des Moines, Iowa as a field intern for Biden’s presidential bid, the Pennsylvania native jumped at the opportunity.
“I didn’t realize how much more there was to a campaign that I didn’t see,” Varanasi said. “My job is to talk to people [and] my role, whether it be through phone calls or door-knocking or meeting people, is to have honest conversations about what they think … and what they care about the most.”
Varanasi is taking part in the Unruh Institute of Politics’ Inside Iowa Project, a new initiative that gave a cohort of 10 students the chance to work in Iowa for the summer to see the states’ impact on the 2020 presidential election. The program started at USC after co-director Mike Murphy piloted the program at the University of Chicago in 2015.
“Especially if you’re in a place like California, we don’t have the same relationship [with elections] as states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina — all these early primary states,” said Meghan Ginley, program director of the Unruh Institute. “The access these students get to the candidates is unparalleled to anything they would get to what they would get in California.”
In February, Iowa will host the 2020 Democratic Caucus, the first nominating contest of the Democratic presidential primaries for the upcoming election. 
“Iowa represents the rest of the country, [and] I believe the people here are really genuine about being informed,” Varanasi said. “If you want to know what this extremely populated country is thinking about politics, you go to Iowa. It has that metropolitan city, and it has so many farm towns … it makes sense as to why it is representative.”
Students had the opportunity to gain campaign and communication experience, while living and learning in the state’s capital. Of the 10 USC students involved in the project, three students are interning for Biden, two for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, two for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, one for California Sen. Kamala Harris, one for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and one for the Republican Party in Iowa. 
Before their time in Iowa, the cohort participated in various sessions where the students got to speak with campaign professionals and political operatives to gain more insight into their work as field interns.
According to the USC Center for the Political Future website, students attended various workshops about how to run and operate a presidential campaign to learn more about the political culture of Iowa.
“They would give us advice and have us ask them questions to prepare us for [Iowa],” said project fellow Lan Duong, a sophomore majoring in international relations.
Duong said that though there are typical tasks she has to complete as a field intern, every day on the job is different.
“In a week, we have to take some phone calls, we have to canvas and we also have to set up meetings with people [that are] one on one,” Duong said. “That’s part of the relationship building.”
Similar to Duong, Varanasi’s schedule always differed — from calling voters and campaigning at events, to canvassing door-to-door and meeting voters from all over the state. On more than one occasion, Varanasi even got the chance to meet Biden.
“I kid you not, I started crying,” Varanasi said. “I feel like I was really cynical in terms of politics … and felt that everything anyone said wasn’t coming from a place of authenticity, but he was so authentic.”
As the only student in the program with a STEM major, Varanasi said her experience has given her a new perspective on the emerging importance of scientific and technological literacy in politics. 
“After this whole talk about election security in 2016, it felt like the two fields [of computer science and political science] needed each other more than ever,” Varansi said. “With Obama’s campaign, I think that was the first time we ever saw someone take the digital space seriously in an election.”
For Varanasi and the rest of her cohort, the program will extend past its 10-week internship. During the caucus in February, the students will travel back to Iowa to observe the kick-off of the 2020 presidential election.
For Duong, however, the program has inspired her to postpone her sophomore year at USC to work in Iowa for Harris’ campaign until the caucus. Duong said the greatest lesson she learned on the campaign so far has been the importance of making authentic connections with others.
“The value of interpersonal relationships, even in other careers and genuinely caring about [others] as opposed to empty networking … is what wins elections,” Duong said. “And in general, that is what will help you.”

After a 30-year hiatus, Phi Kappa Tau fraternity was officially approved by the University last year to return to Greek Row. Over the past year, the fraternity has grown and now marks USC’s largest Greek expansion in five years. 
After experiencing financial troubles in 1988 that led to its eventual dissolution, students reestablished the fraternity with a focus on anti-hazing policies and strengthening community relationships.
Phi Kappa Tau, which was established as USC’s fourth fraternity in 1918, gained 30 members at the end of the 2018-19 school year.
“Our chapter was always in good standing and was never kicked off for hazing or anything like that,” Phi Kappa Tau president Seth Novosel said.
According to Phi Kappa Tau Vice President of Alumni Relations Beau Classen, many alumni continued the organization’s traditions throughout the chapter’s 30-year hiatus. Novosel, a senior majoring in business administration, said the fraternity’s Chairman of the Board of Governors Rick Rice hosted weekly tailgates for alumni and was a major player in advocating for the chapter’s reestablishment. 
“I think they just wanted their fraternity back [and] they just wanted kids to have the same bond they did,” said Classen, a senior majoring in communication. 
According to Novosel, the University previously restricted Greek life to its 23 fraternities. He said Phi Kappa Tau waited for an opening to reestablish their chapter, which came when several hazing allegations resulted in some fraternities losing recognition on campus in the last five years.
The University officially opened expansion opportunities in 2016, Novosel said. Alongside Rice and other alumni, Phi Kappa Tau’s national organization approached USC about restarting their chapter. Darryl Thompson, associate director of organizational growth, said the national chapter met with USC in spring 2016 to consider bringing the chapter back to campus.
The national organization also had to get approval from the Interfraternity Council to reestablish the chapter, IFC President Matteo Mendoza said. 
Novosel said IFC and the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership and Development worked together to assess the organization’s proposal. Once the proposal was approved last October, the national organization began recruitment for leadership positions within the chapter as part of the reestablishment process.
According to Novosel, the summer-long recruitment process required in-person visits with members of the national organization, speeches outlining their qualifications and phone interviews with higher-ranked staff at the national headquarters in Oxford, Ohio. 
“The membership that they were able to achieve in their first semester on campus is nothing short of impressive,” Mendoza said. “I think it’s a testament to the strength of Greek life that they’re already seeing so much success.”
Phi Kappa Tau’s progress was also recognized at the IFC’s awards ceremony. The fraternity was recognized with the Rise of Troy award for its excellence in recruitment. 
Additionally, Novosel received the award for Emerging Greek Leader of the Year for his efforts in coordinating the expansion.
Now entering its second operating semester, Phi Kappa Tau is promoting a staunch policy against hazing, since numerous fraternities have lost recognition due to hazing violations in recent years. 
“Our founding was predicated upon a similar [anti-hazing] circumstance. [The founding members] saw that as an opportunity to change [hazing culture]” Thompson said of the USC chapter.
Novosel said he is proud of the efforts the IFC is making to move away from a supposed hazing culture.
“I think Matteo has done a fantastic job of really making a change on this culture and I think this year we are really going to notice that change,” Novosel said.
This article was updated at 8:43 a.m. on Aug. 29. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Phi Kappa Tau was officially reestablished in Spring 2019. The fraternity was officially reestablished in Fall 2018.

It’s hard to critique Rihanna — a beauty icon, fearless fashionista, pop star and philanthropist. In all of her business endeavors, she’s paid particular attention to the needs of communities underserved in makeup and fashion — particularly Black women. 
Unfortunately, it seems that she didn’t apply her usual precision when choosing the honorees for her famed Diamond Ball, the yearly celebration for the Clara Lionel Foundation, an organization Rihanna founded to benefit impoverished communities around the world. 
This year, “@badgalriri” will honor Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, and civil rights activist Shaun King will receive the Diamond Ball Award. 
Rihanna has a long history of support for Mottley. In 2018, after Mottley was elected as prime minister of Barbados, she took to Instagram to express her support: “Well deserved and about time! Breaking barriers and making history in so many ways!!!”
As for King, Rihanna’s support of the activist leaves many eyebrows, including my own, raised. 
I can’t dismiss King’s efforts to draw national attention to the murder of Michael Brown, who was killed by police officer Darren Wilson. I also can’t dismiss his civil-rights based writing at the height of police brutality and violence in cities like Ferguson and Charleston. 
However, since King’s rise to prominence, and with the Black Lives Matter movement as his springboard, he’s faced many challenges and controversies as his platform continues to expand.
This list is long and hefty.
According to BuzzFeed News, two organizations he founded,  “Justice Together” and “Justice. That’s All,” were abruptly disbanded after raising thousands of dollars. In an investigation done by the Daily Beast’s Goldie Taylor, the reporter exposed discrepancies in fundraising totals King raised for multiple charities, including a Haiti relief project and an unauthorized crowdfunding project for the family of Tamir Rice. 
In January, King responded to accusations that he failed to distribute funds to the intended beneficiaries. 
“On March 1st, I am releasing a public accounting of every dollar I’ve ever raised for families in the Black Lives Matter Movement, along with statements of support from them clearly stating that I have never done such a thing,” he said in a blog post. 
After 180 days, the public, and more importantly, the charities and families he promised financial support, have received nothing. 
On top of that, King publicly berated Clarissa Brooks, a young queer Black woman, when she called him out for the misappropriated funds. He even threatened legal action against her by strongarming her with prominent civil rights attorneys.
Long story short, Shaun King is not only a charity scam artist but a threat to less prominent Black activists, particularly Black women activists. This is why choosing him as an awardee for Rihanna’s CLF Diamond Ball startles me. 
In defense of Rihanna, we have no way of knowing if she chose King herself or if her team at CLF knew of the controversy surrounding King. But their actions are a commentary on the struggle that smaller grassroots movements and their byproducts face when pushed into the mainstream — especially by celebrities. 
Our favorite artists are not always well-versed on policy and community organizing efforts. They may not understand the nuances of grassroots movements and only have a general understanding and appreciation for activist groups and organizers who gain widespread attention — like Shaun King.
As celebrity culture becomes more intertwined with activism and political movements, we must be more cognizant of the way those joint efforts emulate the key aspect of celebrity culture: fame. 
But Rihanna and CLF likely chose Shaun King because of his visibility, viral tweets and celebrity, not based on his actual impact and relationship to the Black Lives Matter movement. 
Rihanna isn’t the only celebrity who’s made missteps in their choices as powerful figures in society.  Jay-Z’s Roc Nation established an entertainment collaboration with the NFL earlier this year, sans involvement from Colin Kaepernick. Jay-Z was criticized because the NFL shunned Kaepernick  after he took a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice. 
The Carolina Panthers’ Eric Reid, who routinely kneels for the anthem, criticized the rapper for claiming “we’ve moved past kneeling” when referring to action items aimed at addressing and protesting the racial and social injustices. 
“For one, when has Jay-Z ever taken a knee?” Reid said. 
Reid’s comments highlight how out of touch celebrities can be with the work, consequence and nuance of grassroots movements. 
It’s not that Jay-Z and Roc Nation were ill-intentioned, nor do I fully question the commitment they have to the issues they champion. But they failed to apply the same attention to detail and apparent integrity into social justice-based ventures that they do with their music, fashion, liquor and other enterprises. When our “faves” fail to do their due diligence in their efforts, they are complicit in a world that overshadows, ignores and co-opts the work of grassroots movements and organizers. 
In a perfect world, when the Roc Nation and the NFL partnership is actualized, it’ll be done in a way that addresses the league’s silencing of Kaepernick and honors the work he’s done off the field. Hopefully, Rihanna or the Clara Lionel Foundation will publicly address the backlash regarding King. 
Hopefully she chooses to remove him as an honoree and express her support for both black women and accountability.

Despite winning the 2019 Doodle for Google competition, freshman Arantza Peña Popo doesn’t consider the world her oyster just yet. She’s ambitious, but her feet are firmly planted.  Peña is entering USC undeclared, unsure of what path to take but impatient to see what her years have in store for her. 
Born in Colombia, Arantza moved with her family to Costa Rica and then to the United States when she was 3 years old. That was right around the time she picked up “random Crayola pens” and began to draw.
“I’ve been drawing since I was 3 years old,” Arantza told the Daily Trojan. “On coffee paper, with random Crayola pens. I’ve been drawing most of my life.”
Fast forward to middle school, and Arantza is now more serious about art; she’s learning more about what it means to others and to herself. She has decided to at least pursue art on the side.
“When I was younger, I wanted to be a scientist, but that didn’t work out. But, I guess, in middle school, I learned a lot more about art,” Arantza said. “I [wanted] to do something, or at least do it on the side as a teacher.” 
Arantza did keep drawing on the side, and now, she is coming to USC fresh off one of her greatest accomplishments. But, as grand as it was to have her doodles dominate the most visited webpage in the world, it was achieved in true college student fashion — the day it was due. 
Yet, this last-minute doodle was victorious among more than 200,000 entries. 
“I did it last minute, so I was like, ‘I’m not gonna win this.’ And then I did. So that was really cool,” Arantza said. “Everyone around me was freaking out like, ‘Oh my gosh you won!’ … but I was like really chill.”
Maybe her casual reaction was grounded in the serious purpose behind her drawing — Arantza’s doodle interrupts the word “Google,” and inserts four women, where the second “O” should be. The women are standing behind each other, with the first two (a mother and her baby) framed as if they were in a portrait. The theme of this year’s competition was “When I grow up, I hope…” and, according to Popo, the first frame depicts her mother holding her as a baby. The second picture similarly features Popo and her mother, but with Popo holding her mother instead. 
“When I grow up, I hope to care for my mom as much as she cared for me my entire life,” Popo said in an interview with The Champion. “In my doodle, there is a framed picture of my mother carrying me as a baby — a real picture in my house — and below the picture is me, caring for her when she’s older in the future.”
At the end of the day, thanking her mom is what matters most to Popo. 
“When we were younger, [my mom] worked really hard for us,” she said. “So I really wanted to thank her, and I think she’s proud! My mom isn’t really a vocal person, but I think she’s proud.”
Popo’s inspiration comes from other people’s stories — meeting people from all different backgrounds is what she’s most excited to experience during her time at USC.
“These past few days, I’ve met people from really different walks of life,” she said. “It’s really cool to just share different stories.”
Stories abound at USC and students from every corner of the globe walk this campus — now, there is an artist among them, ready to turn their tales into doodles.
