“Star Wars” has had a rough couple of years. 
In 2015, after buying the franchise from George Lucas, Disney began to produce its own series of “Star Wars” film, picking up where the original saga left off. The initial two entries — J.J. Abrams’ “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” and “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” directed by Gareth Edwards — were both fairly well-received by the fanbase and made a large profit. 
But “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” Rian Johnson’s 2017 entry to the saga, marked a schism in the franchise. Its release divided the “Star Wars” fanbase into people who liked the direction taken in the film and people who didn’t, kicking off a wave of online discourse as well as a constant storm of harassment against those involved in the making of the film.
The next “Star Wars” film to be released, “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” was the lowest-grossing “Star Wars” movie in North America. Critically, it was fairly well-received, but there was a general wave of fatigue for “Star Wars” in general. Back when Lucas made them, there was one film every two to three years, maybe even more. But ever since 2015, there has been at least one “Star Wars” film per year. For the first time, “Star Wars” wasn’t an event: It was just another movie, another franchise, another product to be consumed.
This brings us to last year’s entry — “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” directed by Abrams yet again. It’s a film that is meant not only to finish off the Disney trilogy but also the entire six-decade-long Skywalker Saga. 
It is a complete and utter failure in both regards.
It is clear that the executives at Disney, after receiving the controversial reactions to “The Last Jedi,” were determined to produce something that would satisfy everyone, but in the process did just the opposite. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” attempts to reverse many decisions in “The Last Jedi” that people were unhappy with — the portrayal of Luke, the killing of Snoke, the reveal of Rey’s parentage — but provides nonsensical answers, panders to the audience and sacrifices theme and character along the way. 
“Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” is what happens when you take a brave artistic creation like the original “Star Wars” saga and hand it over to what is ostensibly a corporation with little to no interest in creating something truly great, more concerned with being able to release one to two  focus-tested products into theaters each year and consistently making money with it. 
As someone who loves “Star Wars,” it was a sickening experience. As someone who loves film, it was a sickening experience. 
I could go on and on about the shoddy writing, incoherent plotting and muddled character arcs. I could talk about how each and every decision made in this film is the wrong one or how flat and joyless the whole thing is. 
But ultimately the most powerful thing I can say, as someone who has loved “Star Wars” for as long as I can remember, for someone who applied to USC because it’s the school Lucas went to, for someone who has spent countless hours in this universe is that I hope we get no more “Star Wars” movies for a very, very long time.

Among the 40 active USC graduates now in the NFL, according to ESPN, 14 managed to make it to the playoffs representing eight different teams. 
As of this past weekend’s action, only two remain in the chase for the Lombardi Trophy: defensive tackle Jurrell Casey and cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, both members of the Tennessee Titans.
Facing the tall task of stopping the Baltimore Ravens’ presumptive league MVP Lamar Jackson and the highest scoring offense in the NFL, Adoree Jackson and Casey marched into Baltimore with a hot Tennessee Titans squad fresh off a win over the New England Patriots in Foxborough. 
Against New England, Casey helped to keep quarterback Tom Brady uncomfortable while Adoree’ Jackson had the task of manning up against former Arizona State alumnus and standout receiver N’Keal Harry. Formerly a threat to the Trojans, Harry was kept in check by Adoree’ Jackson, as he logged just two catches for 27 yards on seven targets while Adoree’ Jackson picked up two deflections.
Adoree’ Jackson was brilliant once again against the Ravens, compiling three deflections against speedy receiver Marquise “Hollywood” Brown and a host of talented tight ends. Still, Casey served as the real game changer, logging two sacks, two tackles for a loss and picking up an important strip sack of Lamar Jackson that set up a touchdown to put the game firmly out of reach. 
Casey, Adoree’ Jackson and the Titans will travel to Kansas City to take on 2018 NFL MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs Sunday.
On the NFC side, defensive lineman Rasheem Green and the Seattle Seahawks gave Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers a battle until the final moments of their matchup at Lambeau Field Sunday. After a solid performance against a banged-up Philadelphia Eagles team in the Wild Card round — where Green picked up two tackles and a sack en route to a 17-9 win — Seattle fell to the Packers 28-23, in large part due to a controversial first down ruling on Green Bay’s final possession. 
Green ended the regular season leading the Seahawks with four sacks — more than elite teammates like Jadeveon Clowney and Ezekiel “Ziggy” Ansah.
On the losing side of the Seahawks-Eagles matchup, former Trojan wide receiver Deontay Burnett played sparingly but logged a 5-yard reception on his only target. A standout Trojan, Burnett was signed late in the season to help replenish the Eagles’ depleted receiving corps — including injured Trojan alumnus Nelson Agholor — and made several key plays down the stretch as they locked up the NFC East title.
Lastly, the Minnesota Vikings fell to the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara 27-10 despite great contributions from defensive end Everson Griffen throughout their postseason run. In a massive overtime upset victory against the Super Bowl contending New Orleans Saints, Griffen racked up 1.5 sacks and three quarterback hits for Minnesota. Throughout the regular season, Griffen  finished in the top 20 in the NFC in sacks and only ranked behind Danielle Hunter for the top spot on the Vikings. 
But on Saturday, Griffen was held in check by a powerful 49ers offensive line and will have to regroup and prepare for the 2020 season.
With the draft coming in late April and plenty of talented Trojans such as receiver Michael Pittman Jr., defensive lineman Christian Rector and offensive tackle Austin Jackson set to turn professional, the list of Trojan playoff performers is only bound to grow.

Pop is changing. Not only are genres like electronica, trap, flamenco and country dispersing influence into pop’s sonic atmosphere, but pop is becoming more lyrically attuned to its millennial and Gen Z audiences. The hyper self-awareness of the digital age is reflected in its biggest artists. Billie Eilish croons about jumping off the Golden Gate bridge over a haunting piano loop on “everything i wanted.” Charli XCX speaks of falling into heartbreak induced K-holes on “February 2017.” And who could forget Ariana Grande’s “I’m a motherfuckin’ train wreck” lyric, less than 10 seconds into her latest smash hit “boyfriend.” It makes sense then, after her public battle with lupus and breakup with R&B artist The Weeknd, that Gomez would have her own piece of the decade’s confessional pop pie.
However, “Rare” is not a diamond in the rough but rather a mass-manufactured cubic zirconia in a polished display case. While its production value is clearly high, it suffers from unoriginality and fails to achieve its goal of being emotionally honest.
For all the songwriters credited on this album, the lyrics are incredibly bland and the hooks — mostly forgettable. 
At times, the two are inversely related; for instance, on the title track, the chorus is ridiculously  catchy, but the lyrics “Baby, you’ve been so distant from me lately / And lately don’t even wanna call you ‘baby,’” make me think the song was more inspired by Rhymezone.com than Gomez’s personal life. 
At other times, the two collide to create insufferable grocery store checkout music. “People You Know” and “Let Me Get Me” are repetitive and annoying and feel long despite their short run times. 
At its absolute worst, the project blatantly rips off other top 40 hits. “Ring” is a carbon copy of Camila Cabello’s “Havana,” right down to the “oh na-na,” and the chorus lyrics on “Kinda Crazy” sound a little too reminiscent of “Say My Name” by Destiny’s Child. 
In addition to its mediocre writing, the vocals are pretty lackluster. It’s no secret that Gomez’s vocal power is average, which is fine — not every artist can nor should belt like Beyoncé — but she doesn’t compensate for it. There are few moments on “Rare” where I feel her voice truly shines. Instead, it feels lost in a sea of overproduced filler littered with ear candy. 
Perhaps the most unsurprising aspect of this album is its production. Gomez and her producers have every resource at their disposal to make a record that is both innovative and still true to her, yet what they have created is an ordinary byproduct of the music industry’s increasing push toward streamable three-minute bangers. 
“Vulnerable” is a disappointingly safe collaboration with Jon Bellion, accurately described by him as, “sonically … an all white beach party in Dubai.” “Crowded Room” and “Cut You Off” are unconvincing Grande impersonations, the latter carrying some of the most boring percussion on the record. When “Rare” does show off its impressive production value, it is often overshadowed by other elements, like obnoxious lyrics or mind-numbing vocal chops.
Despite its pitfalls, there are a couple gems. The verses on “Look At Her Now” sound like ecstasy, with gorgeous flowing synths and excellently mixed vocals. My favorite track on “Rare” is her single “Lose You to Love Me.” I love the swelling strings and plucky piano moments, as well as how dramatic the chorus vocals are. Although she doesn’t exactly dive deeper than the surface level analysis of heartbreak, the grandiose production makes the song sound beautiful and honest to her. 
Is Gomez talented enough to create a record that finds power in risk-taking and vulnerability? Yes. Does she do that here? Unfortunately, no. “Rare” is nothing new or special. It’s for previously established Selenators, not those looking to expand their musical tastes with genre-bending, insightful pop.

It’s 2020 — how about we forget about resolutions and come up with a reading goal? You may think you have no time to read, but I say we make like @hotdudesreading and put our hours spent mindlessly scrolling to good use. There are nearly 500,000 books in Doheny Library just waiting for us. Here are some recommendations for everyone from the graduating senior to the burnt-out arts student.
Freshman year must read:
“The Idiot” by Elif Batuman
 Starting university in the middle of Los Angeles can be tough. And although this Pulitzer prize-nominated novel takes place across the country at Harvard University, Selin’s struggles to navigate her freshman year should be required reading for all first-year students. Her attempts to find herself through silent film courses and summers spent teaching English in Hungary are as funny as they are bleak. Batuman’s writing is as honest and raw as it gets. “The Idiot” is set in the ‘90s, and while the technological gaps are evident (Selin communicates with her friend, Ivan, almost solely through email), it is relatable for anybody who has ever left home. 
For the student with “no time to read:”
“Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self Delusion” by Jia Tolentino
 This collection of nine essays is perfect for everyone from the busy Marshall student to the swamped Ph.D. candidate. Tolentino, a staff writer at The New Yorker, reports on topics such as athleisure, children’s book heroines and sexual assault on college campuses. The collection’s format makes Tolentino’s work accessible while also making you rethink and question the world in which we live.
For the student fed up with hook-up culture:
“Everything I Know About Love” by Dolly Alderton
British journalist and podcast host Alderton’s wild tales of her trials and tribulations in romantic love (and lack there of) will make you cringe, cry and feel a little less alone. From nights out during her time at university to Tinder meet ups in New York, Alderton has seen it all. This book is like a warm hug from an older sister, written in short, digestible chapters. It’s a quick but powerful read.
For the arts student in a creative rut:
“Franny and Zooey” by J.D. Salinger
Salinger was definitely a little out there. Nevertheless, my theatre major roommate swears by this book. She’s read it over and over again and constantly tells anyone that will listen that this is the book to read. Made up of two short (ish) stories, “Franny and Zooey” is full of memorable characters. It’s about love and family and is perfect for the student worried about where their future is going, artistically or otherwise.
For the graduating senior:
“The Beautiful Chaos of Growing Up” by Ari Satok
“Beautiful chaos” is a nice way of looking at growing up. Perfect for the senior standing between college life and the next step in their career, this poetry book perfectly captures the ups and downs of young adulthood. Satok’s words cover topics from cooking to marriage in a timely, relatable way and is certain to make readers remember their college years with a smile as they look forward to the years to come.
“Animals” by Emma Jane Unsworth
 A blurb in “Animals” opens with this: “It is the moment every twenty-something must confront: it’s time to grow up.” Unsworth’s tales of the friendship between two women on the brink of their 30s perfectly portrays the beautiful complexity of female friendship and the struggles that come with life on your own.
Coming soon:
“Hidden Valley Road: Inside the mind of an American Family” by Robert Kolker
 While another book about medicine is probably the last thing a pre-health student is looking for, I’d make an exception for this one. “Hidden Valley Road” is the heartbreaking and eye-opening story of a family where six of 12 children are diagnosed with schizophrenia. The novel is as much a story about the intense, abusive dynamics in the Galvin family as it is the journey of the medical field to understand the disorder. Written by the author of The New York Times bestseller “Lost Girls,” “Hidden Valley Road” will be available in April.
“Winds of Winter” by George R.R. Martin 
In the event that Martin’s sixth installment in the “A Song of Ice and Fire” series is published this year (the last book in the series was released in 2011), it will be a race to the bookstores to see how the penultimate novel in the series that inspired “Game of Thrones” pans out. According to an article published by The Independent, the novel is rumored to be released before the summer, however, similar rumors circled in 2015 and the years that followed. 
“Ghosts” by Dolly Alderton
The aforementioned Alderton’s debut novel will explore themes as varied and relevant as online dating and ageing parents. British journalist Elizabeth Day calls Alderton the “Nora Ephron for the millenial generation,” and her tale of a food critic who appears to have it all will not disappoint. “Ghosts” will be available in July.

Are you an out-of-town spring admit looking to explore your new home? Whether you’ve just moved to Los Angeles or you’ve lived here your entire life, it’s always a good time to check out what the City of Angels has to offer. One of the great things about going to school at USC is that there’s always so much going on nearby. Here are a few fun spots to check out around town. 
Griffith Park
Offering picturesque, panoramic views of L.A., Griffith Park is the perfect destination for a sunny day or a sunset. If you have some time on your hands and are looking to get active, try hiking Bronson Canyon or the Brush Canyon Trail with some friends. Or if you’d prefer to stay inside, Griffith Observatory has lots of great attractions, like the Samuel Oschin Planetarium under the building’s iconic dome. As a bonus, admission to the observatory is always free.
Hollywood Walk of Fame
Arguably one of the most ubiquitous of L.A.’s tourist attractions is the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Since the unveiling of its first eight stars back in 1958, the Walk of Fame has immortalized the careers of more than 2,600 entertainers. The Walk is accessible from the Hollywood/Highland and Hollywood/Vine stops on the Metro Red Line. Coming up this Friday, it will dedicate 2,684th star to Iranian Armenian American musician Andy Madadian. If you’re looking for the quintessential L.A. tourist experience, this is it.
The Broad 
The Broad houses an impressive collection of more than 2,000 works within its architecturally striking walls. The Broad features a number of immersive installations, such as Yayoi Kusama’s “Infinity Mirrored Rooms” exhibitions, which are currently on display. Take in the sights or take some pictures for your feed. Admission to The Broad is free, but tickets have timed entries associated with them so plan your trip in advance.
La Brea Tar Pits
As the only Ice Age fossil site that’s currently being excavated in the middle of a city, the La Brea Tar Pits offer a truly unique experience to visitors. Scientists have uncovered many mysteries of the past from the fossils preserved in the Tar Pits’ asphalt such as 16 fossil deposits and a nearly intact mammoth skeleton. The museum adjacent to the Tar Pits is home to a whopping 3.5 million Ice Age fossils. As part of the annual SoCal Museums Free-For-All Day, the La Brea Tar Pits will offer free admission Jan. 25.
California African American Museum
Located right across the street from campus in Exposition Park, the California African American Museum features thought-provoking exhibitions. Although the museum primarily focuses on the artworks of African Americans, it also features contemporary artists from all over the African diaspora. Like the La Brea Tar Pits, the California African American Museum will participate in the annual SoCal Museums Free-For-All Day on Saturday, Jan. 25.
Watts Towers Art Center
Designated as a National Historic Landmark, the Watts Towers are a collection of 17 sculptures constructed from steel, mortar, mosaic tiles and other materials. A central part of the Watts community, the towers serve as an epicenter of art and culture that has grown through the establishment of the Watts Towers Art Center. The Art Center showcases artists from diverse disciplines and is celebrating its 99th year.
Amoeba Music
The largest independent music store in the world is located right here in L.A. Amoeba Music’s Hollywood location takes up an entire city block and offers customers millions of titles to choose from. If you enjoy crate digging, this is certainly the place to do it. Whether you’re looking to hunt down old favorites, broaden your musical horizons or find a poster to hang in your dorm, Amoeba has it all.
The Roxy Theatre
If you couldn’t get enough of the music at Amoeba, you should definitely catch a live show. The Roxy is the perfect place to see an intimate performance. The roughly 500-person venue showcases rising talent from different genres and makes for a great destination for a night out with friends. Concerts account for one of the many facets of L.A.’s lively performing arts scene, and The Roxy is a great place to begin exploring that culture.

Within this last decade, the rise of technology, globalization and shifting attitudes and values has cultivated an increasingly interconnected and complex world. 
Therefore, it is important for universities like USC to develop curricula that not only reflect these rapid changes but also offer tools that allow the next generation to best adapt to them. One of the easiest ways USC can support its students through this change is by expanding its interdisciplinary studies. 
Interdisciplinary majors allow students to combine multiple, often complementary fields of study into one program and degree. These majors can expose students to different fields of study, rather than confining a student to one. 
The wide array of choices allows students to look at a similar theme from different angles, which only deepens their understanding of a problem. In fact, Zahir Irani, the pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom, explains that rigid departments can hurt innovation, and interdisciplinary studies create “context-specific programmes that better suit industry and prepare students for jobs.”
Additionally, Irani argues that interdisciplinary programs also benefit the academic institutions themselves, as research councils now look to fund projects that intersect multiple fields of study and bring new insight. 
Interdisciplinary studies increase critical thinking skills, allowing students the ability to compare and contrast ideas across multiple fields. College should be a time of exploring new  disciplines, and interdisciplinary studies allow students to cross into fields they might otherwise not have taken underneath one concrete major. 
Currently, there are seven interdisciplinary majors and 15 interdisciplinary minors listed on the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences website, with the additional option for students to create their own interdisciplinary major. 
However, the option for students to create their own interdisciplinary course is extremely competitive, requiring an extensive application and very specific idea of what students want to do. So most students who choose to pursue an interdisciplinary program must pick from one already created by USC. For this reason, USC should focus on developing a wider array of options of interdisciplinary studies they can offer to interested students.
Thus far, USC does acknowledge the benefits of interdisciplinary studies through some of the available choices of interdisciplinary majors. The interdisciplinary health and the human sciences major allows students to choose from courses like chemistry, sociology, psychology, gender and sexuality and international relations. In contrast, students are confined primarily to biology classes if they choose to pursue a Bachelor of Arts in the non-interdisciplinary major of human biology. 
USC also offers interdisciplinary minors, such as the international health, development and social justice minor, which allows students to choose from classes like anthropology, biology, economics, international relations, philosophy and political science. Instead of forcing a student to choose between multiple topics, they enjoy this minor, along with other interdisciplinary minors, allows students to look at a problem through many different lenses, thereby using the diversity of the minor to broaden their perspective. 
Out of all the available interdisciplinary majors already created, there are only programs with Bachelor of Arts degrees, with none offering degrees in Bachelor of Science. This focus on interdisciplinary majors within liberal arts means that there is certainly room for USC to grow its interdisciplinary program into STEM. 
In fact, The Engineer of 2020 report calls for “an engineering profession that will rapidly embrace the potentialities offered by creativity, invention and cross-disciplinary fertilization to create and accommodate new fields of endeavor, including those that require openness to interdisciplinary efforts with non-engineering disciplines.”  
Although it may be more challenging to infuse the fluidity and flexibility of interdisciplinary studies into rigid STEM course work, students should have the option to explore multiple fields of study, regardless of whether their major is humanities or science-based.
Ultimately, an emphasis on interdisciplinary studies creates a more well-rounded student body with the tools needed to take on the nuanced, complicated problems that surely await post-graduation.

Sexual assault at USC has increased since 2015. But even worse, undergraduate students’ awareness of their resources on campus has decreased in contrast to the national trend, as shown in the 2019 Association of American Universities Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct. 
On the surface, the University claims to be addressing the issue to their best efforts. Yet, one integral aspect that the University is not only dismissing but actively working against is the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention center. RSVP offers the best hope for rhetoric to turn into action. The office provides the most vital resources for various stages of relationship and sexual violence with preventative trainings, confidential counseling services and advocacy for survivors if and when they want to report. Even further, RSVP provides services for other power and gender-based harms besides sexual assault, such as domestic violence and stalking. 
While I want to advocate for rape kits on campus, the availability of a sexual assault nurse examiner and other necessary additions as resources for USC students, these upcoming strides cannot occur when the University creates overlapping initiatives that fail to direct students to their current, primary resources. 
The University directly undermines RSVP’s visibility. The new website for USC Student Health omits RSVP’s name, titling the section “Sexual Assault & Survivor Support.” By excluding the proper name of the resources, the RSVP center is only known through the USC Student Health website, perpetuating the lessening of accessibility and knowledge of RSVP. 
Even more troubling, the center no longer has its own phone number for urgent matters, thanks to a new directive to bury it under the USC Student Health website’s main-line. So, if a student requires emergency assistance, the best you can expect is a long series of extensions and transfers before actually reaching RSVP. This new phone policy further limits RSVP’s accessibility and visibility to students. It discourages students from seeking help when the University makes it so painstakingly difficult and sends the message that our issues are not prioritized. 
Plus, conflicting names like “Sexual Assault & Survivor Support” on the Student Health Center website cause confusion and undercuts the level of immediacy that students require after a traumatizing experience. These detrimental initiatives have a damning effect on our student body as a whole by promoting confusion in a time when assurance is necessary.
Without encouraging more awareness of students’ resources, USC is stifling RSVP’s visibility, accessibility and ultimately its effectiveness as the main resource to combat sexual assault and misconduct at USC.
RSVP has tremendous value to offer our student body. But if the University does not take its commitment seriously, then how can it truly protect survivors of sexual assault? The student body deserves more. We deserve more than USC saving face. We deserve better access and visibility to RSVP. We deserve effective initiatives that will give sexual assault survivors the support they need. We deserve to make this issue unequivocally clear to all students.

Brent Crouch has resigned as the head coach of the USC women’s volleyball team to become the head coach of Auburn University’s program, USC Athletics announced Tuesday. Crouch was with the Trojans for two years, compiling a final record of 40-25 during his tenure at Galen Center.
Crouch led the Trojans to an 18-14 overall record and a sixth-place finish in the Pac-12 this season. Despite many injuries and a difficult schedule, USC managed to make its 29th straight NCAA tournament appearance before falling in the second round to No. 1 overall Baylor. 
The Trojans also lost in the second round of the 2018 tournament to San Diego as the No. 11 overall seed after a 22-11 overall record and a third-place finish in the Pac-12 under Crouch.
Crouch was hired in January 2018 after longtime head coach Mick Haley was relieved of his duties. Now, Crouch will be taking the reins of an Auburn program that went 7-22 overall in 2019 — last in the Southeastern Conference — and failed to earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament.
“The Auburn family is going to see a volleyball program playing a fast, aggressive style of volleyball and to continue to develop young student-athletes at the highest level on and off the court,” Crouch said in a statement from Auburn announcing his hiring. “I expect us to be earning a bid to the NCAA tournament very soon, and I know our athletes are up for that challenge.”
The news comes as the latest installment of a tumultuous day at Heritage Hall. Earlier on Tuesday, three top athletic department officials — Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Steve Lopes, senior associate athletic director Ron Orr and associate athletic director Scott Jacobson — were fired.
The three were let go in connection with the college admissions scandal that surfaced last March but that does not appear to relate to Crouch’s decision to leave USC.
USC has said in a statement that a “search for [Crouch’s] replacement will begin immediately.”

USC fired three prominent members of its athletic department Tuesday — spurred by recent turmoil within the athletic department including the March 2019 college admissions scandal — according to the Los Angeles Times.
The athletic department’s Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Steve Lopes, Trojan Athletic Fund senior associate director Ron Orr and associate athletic director Scott Jacobson are the three senior officials let go by the University. 
Lopes had spent 35 years working in USC’s athletic department and was believed to hold plenty of sway in the department’s decision making, according to the Times. He was also considered as a potential replacement for Pat Haden as the University’s next athletic director in 2016. Lynn Swann, who resigned in September 2019, was chosen as athletic director instead, but Lopes’ influence remained.
Orr had been an All-American swimmer as a student at USC and was promoted to senior associate athletic director in 2010. He worked with Jacobson in development and fundraising. Like Lopes, Orr had also been employed by the department for more than three decades. His role as Trojan Athletic Fund senior associate director involved close watch over the fundraising division of the department, which oversees donations from alumni and other donors.
The moves are the most recent developments for an athletic department that has long been riddled with scandal and has played a prominent role in the admissions scandal known as Operation Varsity Blues. Donna Heinel, USC’s former senior associate athletic director, was fired the day she was arrested for her involvement with the scandal and was indicted on federal bribery charges last year. Jovan Vavic, the former USC men’s and women’s water polo coach, was also fired for his role in the scheme.
The three were mentioned in emails filed by attorneys for defendant Robert Zangrillo in a Boston federal court. The emails revealed correspondence between Orr and Heinel concerning the admission status and bribes for a number of prospective students posing as athletes, including a suggestion from Orr that they guilt a certain family into following through with a proposed donation.
According to court documents, Lopes was also found to have recommended admission for a student with a supposed $1 million donation, Orr had recommended a women’s track and field athlete with a $500,000 donation and Jacobson had written a note for another recommendation that read “100,000 — no ask yet.”
Still, none of the three have faced charges as a result of the admissions scandal. 
Since Swann resigned as athletic director, President Carol Folt has expressed her desire to make integrity within the athletic department a top priority both in searching for a new athletic director — eventually Mike Bohn — and in restructuring the department moving forward. These most recent firings appear to be a significant action geared toward meeting these goals.
The University has yet to publicly announce a replacement for any of the three positions.

Editor’s note: A previous version of this article classified Orr’s recommended student as providing a bribe, though the contribution appears to have been a legal donation. The article has been updated online. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Content Warning: Mention of suicide.
More than 100 people learned about mental health stigmas, healthcare, accessibility and the struggle of speaking out at the Mental Health for U.S. Unite for Change Forum held at Bovard Auditorium Monday. 
The event brought together professionals from different sectors to hold a public discussion on the state of mental health. Panelists included former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, NBC news correspondent Kate Snow and Gould School of Law professor Elyn Saks. Dr. Steven Siegel, chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, began by addressing the need for people to speak out on a public platform.
“We encourage you to join the conversation on social media and use the hashtag ‘mental health,’” Siegel said. “We’re working to show policymakers that there’s a huge bloc of voters who care about mental health and addiction.”
Kennedy highlighted the importance of elections, calling on citizens to use their power as voters to draw attention to the importance of mental health nationwide. 
“We’ve barely scratched the surface in addressing the needs of those Americans who need help,” Kennedy said. “The only way to change that is to get active. And that’s going to require us to be political participants in our own democracy.”
Political scientist Norman Ornstein, who has a personal connection to mental health because of his son’s struggle with a psychiatric disorder, spoke on the importance of bringing mental health policy into the political sphere.
“I’ve been watching all the Democratic debates,” Ornstein said. “And so far, no one’s been asked about mental health.”
Anthony Rodriguez, an outreach coordinator for the Santa Barbara Response Network, shared his experience as a person who had attempted suicide three times and his current perspective on dealing with his struggles. 
Along with policies that can support those with mental illness Mental Health America of Los Angeles President Christina Miller advocated for a cultural change in the way we talk about mental illness, highlighting the struggle of many college students to openly speak on mental health. 
“A lot of teens and preteens can’t speak out about things because it’s out of the norm or people think they’re weird,” Treitler said. “I think just speaking up and not being afraid to share your story [is important] because that’s what really affects the people listening.”
Snow also talked about her personal experience with her father-in-law’s suicide. 
“I think that kind of loss was deep for my family, but we are willing to talk about it now because we want to reduce the stigma,” Snow said. “We don’t want it to be something that people whisper about.” 
Jana Wright, a graduate student studying public health, said the event brought insight into current issues concerning mental health services in public health.
“I think one of the best summary of tonight is that we have a system that seeks to cure, not a system of care,” Wright said. “This is a huge issue and we’ve already identified this in public health.” 
Carol Alata, a freshman majoring in computational neuroscience, said the event showed the positive impact of mental health advocacy. 
“It’s not just one person who’s making all of the changes,” Alata said. “Your voice matters. You have every right and a duty to speak and advocate for yourself and for others.”
The event concluded with Wellness Director of the Geffen Academy at UCLA Ross Szabo telling the students that the issue could not end without their efforts to make their voices heard on campus.    
“We can’t stop this problem without your voice, without your story, without your message,” Szabo said. “The more that you organize together in your own communities on campuses, the more changes that you can see.”

With the transition into the new year, pervasive talk of weight loss and diet culture are in full swing. While many see the new year as an opportunity to make resolutions for weight loss and unnecessary body alterations, the danger that these efforts may pose both emotionally and physically, especially to college students, is often overlooked. 
It seems that young people already have a more exacerbated concern over their weight and body image than other age groups. With fears of gaining the “Freshman 15” to comparisons on social media or pressures to look the same as one may have looked after leaving home, college-aged people face a unique set of challenges fueling weight loss and body image insecurities. 
Talk of counting calories, diets and food regimens like intermittent fasting run rampant through campus. Unfortunately, few students are aware that there is little evidence even supporting a 15-pound weight gain in their freshman year; nor is there much evidence supporting the benefits of restrictive fad dieting. 
Several studies have been conducted debunking the myths associated with a 15-pound weight gain. 
A 2008 study conducted by the University of Utah indicated that college freshman experienced only an average 2.7-pound weight gain. Meanwhile, a 2011 study conducted at Boston University found that only 10% of college students actually gain 15 pounds, yet this was associated with binge drinking. The same study also found that a quarter of freshmen actually end up losing weight in their first year. 
Jay Zagorsky, a researcher behind the 2011 study, said that most people gain weight as they get older, but it is not attributed to college but instead to simply becoming a young adult.  
Along with the lack of evidence proving a substantial weight gain in college, students may also find themselves believing many of the false promises made by the powerful dieting industry. 
A National Institute of Health study found that 80% of obese people who lose weight on a diet will end up gaining it back. In the same study, the NIH observed that even people who are not obese but lose weight on a diet will gain back two to four pounds a year to make up for it. 
Weight gain after dieting is the result of a slowed metabolism, which is prompted by restriction. Once a body returns to more normalized eating patterns, it takes time for its metabolism to adjust, subsequently resulting in weight gain. 
Despite the evidence against diets’ effectiveness, the weight-loss industry has continued to flourish, projecting to reach a market value of $278.95 billion in 2023, up from its 2016 value of $168.95 billion. Instead of helping those in need of weight loss though, the industry seems to capitalize on the fears and insecurities of consumers. 
Utilizing social media as a way to market their products, through influencers to promote toning, slimming and fat-burning products, the diet industry sends messages that exploit insecurities rather than those that empower and uplift. This methodology of marketing tends to target college-aged students, as their age group is the most active on these platforms. 
It is important to consider the psychological implications of engagement with diet culture. Diet culture messages not only reinforce poor self-esteem and body image dissatisfaction, but it may contribute to the normalization of disordered eating. 
At a time when young people show increasing concerns over their mental health and well-being, it is ever more important to be critical of the harmful effects of trends and fads, like weight-loss resolutions.
While the trend of losing weight and restricting or changing one’s body may continue even beyond the new year, young people ought to be mindful of the ways in which such practices might only further the strains placed on their emotional and mental well-being. 
On a campus filled with students capable of making well-informed decisions, perhaps new resolutions should shift away from following industry-produced regiments and diets, and instead move toward other avenues of self-improvement.

To Juul, or not to Juul? We can all agree that electronic cigarettes have infiltrated nearly every segment of pop culture. Now, with an escalation in popularity over the past few years, vaping is spending an immense amount of time in the limelight. 
Last September, the Trump Administration announced its intention to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes in light of the teenage vaping epidemic and the rapid rise of vaping-related illnesses and lung injuries in the United States. Congress voted to raise the national age minimum for buying of tobacco and vaping products to 21 from 18 at the end of 2019. 
Warranted by a public health crisis, these legislative actions address and attempt to regulate underage tobacco and e-cigarette usage. However, they were enacted with a swiftness, tenacity and harmony that directly juxtaposes the disagreements over other public health emergencies like mental health and the gun epidemic — and it is incredibly worrisome. 
As reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the outbreak of vaping-related illnesses began in June 2019 and peaked in September, with a steady decline since. The timeline of problem to proposal to resolution spanning within a period of almost six months was a relatively quick turnover compared to the fruitless demand for other legislation to mitigate these other health crises. 
With the amount of attention students give the vaping crisis, energy toward other epidemics seems to have been compromised. 
The mental health crisis should be of utmost concern, especially with USC’s campus still mourning the unexpected deaths of nine students since the beginning of the school year. Yet vaping has received substantial attention under the pretense that it poses one of the greatest health risks to our population. 
The term “e-cigarette” has been misleadingly glamorized in the media due to the accompanying rise in teenage vaping rates, leading to confusion over the distinctions between various vaping mediums. An e-cigarette involves a battery-operated device used to inhale an aerosol containing chemicals, particularly nicotine and flavorings. However, the media often uses the term broadly, clumping a variety of products together. Juuls contain concentrated amounts of nicotine, while marijuana vape pens contain concentrated amounts of THC — the primary compound in marijuana that reaps the “high” effect. 
Although researchers still know little about the long-term effects of vaping, previous studies have found that the primary ingredients in e-cigarettes are toxic to cells and have been linked to lung and heart disease, lung injury and cancer. This previous research shows that these e-cigarettes can contain carcinogenic and toxic chemicals that are unhealthy to ingest. 
However, the findings associated with the lung injury outbreak do not directly line up with this previous data. In fact, the CDC has linked the lung injury outbreak to Vitamin E acetate, a common additive in THC-containing vaping products. Furthermore, the THC-cartridges containing Vitamin E acetate were mostly sold on the black market. 
This just proves that the vaping problem, in which we are investing mounds of time and energy, has ambiguous roots and is misunderstood by both the public and the Trump Administration. Instead of addressing the problem from where the research stems in the black market, the lung injury outbreak is being approached in a holistic manner that misses the root of the issue completely.  
Meanwhile, according to a study conducted by Cohen Veterans Network and the National Council for Behavioral Health, despite 56% of Americans seeking help, lack of access to mental health care remains the primary cause of the U.S.’ mental health crisis. The country’s’ gun suicide rate is also 10 times higher than that of other high-income countries, while its gun homicide rate is 25 times that of other high-income countries. These concrete statistics innately necessitate change, but such action has been cast aside in favor of a misguided confrontation to the lung injury outbreak. 
 This immense push for action sharply contrasts the rather apathetic administrative approach to the gun and mental health epidemics. Did we send thoughts and prayers to those 2,500 people afflicted with severe lung injuries in the same way we send thoughts and prayers to those 100,000-plus Americans affected by gun violence every year or the 16 million American adults who are affected by major depression every year? This urgency directed toward vaping must be translated to common-sense gun laws and mental health care. 
Obviously multiple issues can receive attention at a time. The vaping health crisis needs to be addressed, but the actions taken by the Trump Administration should not treat it as a scapegoat to deter from the other issues that have been neglected. Take these new changes with a grain of salt and continue scrutinizing lackadaisical approaches to detrimental issues while advocating for reform. 
At the end of the day, those smokable USB flash drives will not be our downfall. It will be naiveté.

The first step in solving a problem is acknowledging there is one. That is why at the end of last semester, we, the Environmental Student Assembly and the USC Environmental Core, authored a letter to President Carol Folt asking for public disclosure of the University’s endowment investments into the energy sector, and in particular, fossil fuels. As of Jan. 13, we have yet to receive a response. 
The fossil fuel industrial complex primarily includes the petroleum, natural gas and coal industries that combine to account for about 76% of U.S. human-generated greenhouse gas emissions. These greenhouse gas emissions, according to overwhelming scientific consensus, are responsible for the increased frequency and severity of environmental disasters, such as the recent fires in Australia that have already killed at least 28 people, which ecologists fear may result in the extinction of multiple species of animals. These fires, coupled with a recent study that found melting permafrost in the Arctic is emitting double the greenhouse gases scientists previously estimated (1.7 billion tonnes of carbon, as much per year as Japan), have again spelt death for our environment, and calls for drastic and fast action by all institutions, USC included. 
Since Folt has taken office, she has demonstrated an admirable ambition toward solving the climate crisis. She has expanded the transit subsidy, fought for zero-waste tailgates and has backed projects aimed at reducing the University’s carbon footprint. While these efforts are necessary to adequately address the crisis, they are not sufficient. The University still refuses to grapple with the carbon footprint of its $5.54 billion endowment, having refused to respond to our letter from Dec. 10 or any of our previous phone calls to the investment office about fossil fuel investments. 
Even if the University were to reach zero-carbon emissions on campus, it would be fairly meaningless if the goal were reached through something like a solar power purchase agreement paid for with the returns off our investments into the sustained growth of carbon-intensive energy. It would be redundant and performative, like “cleaning” a dirty surface with an even dirtier rag. 
 It is important to note that endowment reform doesn’t mean sacrificing the economic salience of our University in favor of activist investments. By virtue of verifiably destroying our shared natural resources, the fossil fuel industry is financially unsustainable and thus is an incredibly risky investment. This is why the University of California system’s endowment went “fossil-free” in September. Investors and fiduciaries of UC’s endowment sold $150 million in fossil fuel assets from their endowment because they posed a long-term risk to generate strong returns for UC’s diversified portfolios, according to a September op-ed in the Los Angeles Times, . 
For these reasons, we again call on the University to disclose its energy investments so that we can begin to have a meaningful conversation about how to actually reduce our carbon footprint. Once disclosed, we call for the University to divest from the fossil fuel industry; then, most importantly, reinvest. Not only does divestment from destructive and financially risky fossil fuel investments assist in reducing the economic viability of energy companies profiting off of the destruction of our planet, it provides the University with a treasure chest of investments in profitable energy and carbon-capture equities that can fight climate change. 
Join us in delivering our message to the University on Monday, Jan. 27 at 3 p.m. at Hahn Plaza for a Climate Strike focused on USC’s disclosure, divestment and reinvestment of its fossil fuel investments.

Improving Dreams, Education, Access, and Success, a campus organization that seeks to create a safe space for undocumented students and facilitate dialogue, met with President Carol Folt and Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp to discuss new resources to support the undocumented community on campus. 
The meeting took place after IDEAS Executive Director Valeria Resendiz met Folt in an elevator and started talking about the organization. The group then came up with a proposal for changes to share with Folt and Crisp. 
Kimberly Alvarado, a senior majoring in social sciences, said the group had previously tried to set up a meeting with former President C.L. Max Nikias but did not receive any response from the administration. However, Alvarado said the organization saw Folt’s appointment as an opportunity to make their voices heard. 
“It is the new administration, and I think that they’re still figuring out a few things,” Alvarado said. “What I took from the meeting is that they are going to work with us for the undocumented community.” 
At the meeting, students discussed the need for a centralized resource center for undocumented students and training for academic counselors and mental health professionals to better understand the undocumented community. IDEAS also advocated for financial aid training since a few students had been misidentified as international students and received inaccurate aid. 
Resendiz, a senior double majoring in political science and NGOs and social change, said that the meeting was a way to get the administration and community to share experiences and begin talking about ways to improve resources for the students. 
“The focus for the meeting was really to build that relationship, to bridge the gap between the administrators and the students who live the experiences,” Resendiz said. “At the same time, we received a lot of empathetic feedback and support from them.”  
While no timeline is in place to implement the changes, Alvarado said she felt that IDEAS members were given enough space and time to talk and felt they were being heard. However, she said they expected action and would follow up if necessary.  
“We received as much time as needed,” Alvarado said. “I felt that both the president and the vice president were interested in what we were saying.”
Resendiz said that the group would continue to provide support to the undocumented community and hold the administration responsible for the changes that were discussed in the meeting. 
“So now our next move is just to use our community and our allies to make sure that they follow through with supporting this community because previous administrations have not,” Resendiz said.  
Crisp said that he and Folt believe that all students who come on campus regardless of their status deserve an equal academic opportunity to achieve their goals but undocumented students often lack access to  financial aid, scholarships and other resources. 
“I think when you’re an undocumented student there are barriers,” Crisp said. “[There are]  obstacles that you have to overcome in order to access education in the same way as students who are not undocumented that have everything to do with immigration classification.”
Currently, the University offers resources such as the Pop-Up Dream Center in the Student Union, an immigration clinic that provides legal assistance and DACA fee renewal support for students. The clinic is currently looking at ways it can train faculty on undocumented student issues and form a physical space where students can access all the resources available to them.
“The University has tremendous space needs all over,” Crisp said. “We’re providing support and community for a lot of our populations, particularly a lot of our underrepresented populations that have all kinds of cultural or other needs … and we need space to figure out how to help to do that.” 
Crisp said that the meeting helped him understand the perspective of undocumented students and learn about the challenges they faced in their daily lives. He said he was amazed at the honesty and openness of the students who shared their experiences. 
“It was very inspiring to hear the students talk about all that they’ve overcome and all that they need to overcome to seek out the same dreams as everybody else on this campus and in this country,” Crisp said. “It was a very powerful meeting that we greatly appreciated.”
Crisp said the meeting got him thinking of ways the administration could continue to support   IDEAS and other groups by working with them to find space and centralizing access to resources.
“[We] certainly came out of it committed to continuing work with this group and with others to try to figure out how we can find better space to create community and opportunities for more programming — how we can do more with what we already have and consolidate things so that our students do have access to the resources that they need,” Crisp said.
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that IDEAS stands for Improving Dreams, Equality, Access, and Success. The acronym stands for Improving Dreams, Education, Access, and Success. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Admissions at USC were cut in half for Spring 2020 following a decrease in fall enrollment. For more than 20 years, the University has welcomed an estimated 650 students into the spring enrollment program.
According to Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold, the University had lower Fall 2019 enrollment numbers than in previous years. The 2018-2019 school year saw about 3,400 new students enroll, while this year’s freshman class enrolled 3,100 new students.
According to Brunold, spring enrollment serves as the University’s waiting list by offering a group of students admission in January while being able to move some up to the fall semester if spots open up. The difference in new student enrollment over the past two years accounts for the decrease in spring enrollment.
“This wasn’t a policy or a decision anyone made,” Brunold said. 
Spring enrollment numbers are responsive to fall enrollment and are not the result of any executive action. This year marks a departure from the previous year in fall enrollment, where Fall 2018 saw an overenrollment of students. As a result, spring enrollment numbers were pushed up, putting a strain on the University’s resources.
The increase in students created a deficit in campus housing in Spring 2019 and led the University to renovate freshman student lounges into temporary overflow housing for about 50 spring admits.
According to USC Housing Director Christopher Ponsiglione, the converted lounge spaces serve as part of the University’s backup housing plans should a similar overflow in enrollment occur. However, any changes to these spaces are temporary and meant to support yearly differences in enrollment. 
“The lounge spaces used last spring were converted back to lounges for this past fall,” Ponsiglione said in an email. 
According to Ponsiglione, no spring-admitted freshmen have been assigned to any converted lounge spaces this semester. 
The University’s spring enrollment program offers a different experience, through a more personal Welcome Week and orientation sessions. The University offers suggestions for how spring-admitted students can spend their fall semesters earning college credits at community colleges or abroad. 
According to Karina Aguirre, a spring-admitted freshman majoring in law, history and culture, the transition into USC for spring-admitted students has room for improvement. 
“During the fall, there should be more encouragement from the University for spring admits to come to USC,” Aguirre said. “If you’re still being considered part of the Trojan Family, then there should be more encouragement throughout the entire year [to join the community].”
Aguirre said she believes spring-admitted students should take advantage of the fall Welcome Week events. Bringing spring-admitted students together with the rest of their class could help dispel any stigma surrounding spring enrollment, she said.
Some spring-admitted students hold strong sentiments about their place in the University. Aguirre said that explaining her position as a spring admit is tiring and often gets undesirable responses that suggest spring admits are different from other students. 
“I never want to have to explain to anyone again that I am a spring admit,” Aguirre said.
The University recognizes that many students share Aguirre’s feelings about spring admissions. According to Brunold, students don’t intentionally apply to attend USC in January, but enrollment numbers fluctuate between fall and spring semesters due to students graduating early or late or going abroad. 
These statistics motivated the University to adjust its admissions process and establish spring enrollment. The Office of Admission is clear about how the spring admissions process works, Brunold said. 
“When we tell [spring-admitted students] about spring admission, you know, we were very careful about explaining what it is and helping them understand why we do it,” Brunold said. 
Despite the University’s efforts to be open and honest about the spring enrollment program, some students feel that more can be done to increase transparency. Aguirre said she thinks the University should include spring-admitted students’ academic statistics in its fall admission profiles to better reflect the academic makeup of all incoming students. 
“I think that if USC is going to continue with a spring admission program, they should be more transparent in how they’re using it,” Aguirre said.

“Full House” actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, filed a motion in the college admissions scandal in Boston federal court last month refuting two of the charges the U.S. government brought against them in the case.
The motion, filed Dec. 13 with the objective to acquire evidence that could be used to help the defense fight the charges the couple faces, requested that the federal court hearing the case require the prosecution to produce evidence that Loughlin and Giannulli intended to defraud USC by paying for their daughters’ admissions as fraudulent athletic recruits. 
Loughlin and Giannulli paid $500,000 between October 2016 and February 2018 to falsely designate their daughters Isabella Rose and Olivia Jade Giannulli as women’s crew recruits in order to gain them admission to the University. As of October 2019, neither Isabella Rose nor Olivia Jade was enrolled at USC, the University confirmed in a statement.
The motion states that Loughlin and Giannulli believed the money they paid to the Key Worldwide Foundation to secure their daughters’ admissions was a legitimate donation. KWF was a fraudulent charity created by William “Rick” Singer, the organizer of the college admissions scheme, to act as a liaison between parents paying for their children’s admission and university officials receiving the bribes.
However, Loughlin and Giannulli “did not understand or intend that either set of payments would be used to directly or indirectly bribe [former USC senior associate athletic director Donna] Heinel,” according to the recent motion, which seeks to frame the payment as an intended donation to University programs.
The couple were charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud in the initial court document made public in March 2019. They were named in two subsequent indictments and now face additional charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery.
According to the motion, the honest services fraud and federal programs bribery charges require the prosecution to prove that the couple intentionally made the fraudulent donation and knew that the money they paid to the Key Worldwide Foundation and the USC Athletics Department would be used to bribe Heinel. 
Of the $500,000 Loughlin and Giannulli paid for their daughters’ admission, they paid $100,000 directly to Heinel, according to court documents. The motion filed by the defense claims the government has failed to release evidence relevant to whether Singer had told them and other parents named in the admissions case that the money they paid would be used for a legitimate cause.
“The Government appears to be concealing exculpatory evidence that helps show that both Defendants believed all of the payments they made would go to USC itself — for legitimate, university-approved purposes — or to other legitimate charitable causes,” the motion stated. “The Government’s failure to disclose this information is unacceptable, and this Court should put a stop to it.”
In the motion, the defense stated that the allegations of the couple paying to secure their children’s admission do not necessarily constitute bribery, citing the court’s rejection of USC’s claim that it does not accept applicants on the basis of donations. According to the document, the difference between a bribe and a donation is whether the money paid was known to the university granting admission. 
The motion cited an Annenberg Media story published last month about Heinel’s private consulting company, which offered workshops for high school counselors, parents and student-athletes about NCAA eligibility, as evidence that the University was aware of the Giannullis’ payments, making them “open” rather than “matters of concealment.”
The government opposed a similar motion made by Gamal Abdelaziz, a Las Vegas casino executive named in the case who allegedly paid $300,000 to KWF, which then bribed Heinel to falsely designate Abdelaziz’s daughter as a USC basketball recruit. Abdelaziz’s defense requested information about whether the payment was made to Heinel’s personal account or to a University account overseen by Heinel, but the government declined to release the information, saying it was “irrelevant to the question whether the payment was a bribe.”
