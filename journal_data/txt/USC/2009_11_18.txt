“Have you eaten yet?” is the way the Chinese greet each other, and that is the way Gloria B (Esther Scott) is greeted by Richie Po (Dennis Dun) in the play Po Boy Tango, written by Kenneth Lin and presented by the East West Players at the David Henry Hwang Theater in Little Tokyo.
Forget that Richie and Gloria have not seen each other in 10 years. Forget that Gloria used to care for Richie’s daughter Emma, who barely survived cancer. Forget that they left each other on ambiguous and hostile terms. Richie immediately feeds Gloria but in doing so unfortunately reveals his terrible cooking skills. The tables are turned, however, when Gloria grills him a delicious sandwich.

Richie is a Taiwanese immigrant who finally earns enough money after juggling three jobs for years. Emma, her cancer in remission, is getting married, and Richie wishes to recreate his deceased mother’s “Great Banquet.”
Although he has remarkable and sensitive tastes, he lacks the culinary skills of his mother, so he seeks Gloria’s help. Gloria is a retired hospice worker who dreams of opening her own soul-food restaurant, and Richie promises her that if she helps him recreate the “Great Banquet,” he will become her partner in building her dream restaurant.
Initial conversation runs along the topic of food, with occasional jibes at “those crazy skinny people.” Amid this casual talk, however, runs a deeper narrative as hidden details are revealed about their personal lives, backgrounds and struggles.
At the first taste, the play seems to center around food, but the main dish contains ingredients such as racism, ethnicity, history and friendship.
Underneath this tentative partnership lies troubled friendships, complex misunderstandings and past wounds. Though they joke, laugh, eat and even tango together, their underlying sentiments eventually erupt, and they express strong, bitter emotions toward the end of the play that heighten the tension already there.
For example, it never becomes clear why Richie is so fixated on recreating this banquet, or why  Gloria accuses Richie of being racist and no better than the other Caucasians. The plot and underlying themes are confusing and hard to follow, which is frustrating because the play held real potential to present a unique perspective of the Asian-American community.
Still, despite the lagging script, low-budget production and simple stage design, the actors’ acting is convincing and entertaining. The characters are endearing, and some of their lines clearly amused and delighted the audience, especially those of Po Mama (played brilliantly and hilariously by Jeanne Sakata).
When the short, scrawny Richie and the tall, rotund Gloria hold hands to tango, the sight is both ludicrous and charming. Even though they scrape at an empty bowl of shark fin soup, the way they lick their spoons and smack their lips creates a strong sensory imagery that causes the audience to salivate as well.
Po Boy Tango makes a worthy attempt to infuse the universal interest in food with unique racial and ethnic themes, but ends up both overcooking and undercooking a lot of its ingredients.
A little bit more time spent tweaking and simplifying some ingredients might make it more palatable and digestible. But right now, it is still one messy recipe — one that leaves its audience unsatisfied but curious and hungry enough to return for a revised dish.

Writer, director and producer Sebastian Gutierrez adds indie comedy to his long résumé of thriller and horror films with Women in Trouble.
Premiered at the 2009 South by Southwest Film Festival, Women in Trouble, which was shot in only 12 days, captures the modern dilemmas of women in an almost satirical manner. Gutierrez uses the unrealistic nature of the film’s characters and storyline, and a raunchy humor, to create an enjoyable farce-like film that is driven by a female cast.

Despite the film’s quick and witty script, Gutierrez owes much of the movie’s success to its talented cast. With the large female cast, the movie features Carla Gugino (Sin City), Connie Britton (Friday Night Lights), Adrianne Palicki (Friday Night Lights) and Sarah Clarke (24). The film even features Gutierrez’s daughter Isabelle Gutierrez as the only teen among the all-adult cast.
As for the men, Simon Baker (The Mentalist) and Joseph-Gordon Levitt (500 Days of Summer) play only supporting roles in the whole scheme of the film. Ironically enough, in Women in Trouble, Baker and Levitt’s characters are among the butt of the jokes in the movie; especially Levitt, who plays an overly excited reporter in a short clip after the movie’s credits.
The film follows the life of 10 troubled women, including Elektra Luxx, a porn star who discovers she is pregnant; Clarke plays Maxine McPherson, a therapist dealing with her husband’s affair with her patient; Britton portrays Doris, a woman whose niece is actually her daughter … and the list goes on.
Like the characters, the comedy’s storyline, which takes place over a span of a few days, features unlikely situations, including a gang’s pathetic attempt to kill a call girl at a lesbian bar after she witnesses a murder.
The long list of characters, thick plot and series of snippets that make up the film are almost suffocating at first. But once you adjust to the film’s style, it’s apparent that the numerous characters and plot are crucial to the film’s success. With each character heavily intertwined with the next, the exaggerated coincidences bring the women together.
Gutierrez uses these coincidences to establish the film’s crude humor. For the audience, these improbable circumstances create interesting snippets of the lives of each woman — a glimpse into their individual troubles.
The film’s female-centric nature addresses the issue of gender imbalance in Hollywood and films today.
“I think Hollywood right now is not particularly interested in the dramatic possibilities of female characters, which is a shame because their emotions are much more readily available than those of male characters,” Gutierrez said in a Q&A session last week.
Women in Trouble simple proves that a mostly females cast can create a successful raunchy comedy — a genre that normally features mostly men — making this film one of only few of its kind in the industry today. This made it easy for Gutierrez to recruit the star-studded cast.
“All of the actresses in the movie were happy to be given material that required more from them than just being ‘the girlfriend,’ ‘the wife,’ or simply ‘the girl’ in the movie,” Gutierrez said.
Even with the bar set a bit higher, the actresses proved they could be more than just “‘the girl’ in the movie.”
Specifically, Palicki’s performance as Holly, one of the more ditzy characters, is a standout. Palicki is able to portray the character as someone who understands that what she lacks in intelligence can be compensated by humor. Palicki’s character, in many ways, is humorous because she can roll with the punches and join in on the jokes rather than just take them.
Despite the cast’s witty performances, by the end of the film, the numerous snippets create too much plot for Gutierrez to resolve in one film. Gutierrez leaves a few plotlines more unfinished than others. Although each storyline is brought to a stopping point, many questions are left unanswered.
The good news is that Gutierrez has finished the sequel to Women in Trouble, Elektra Luxx, which is the second installment in what Gutierrez plans to be a trilogy. According to Gutierrez, Elektra Luxx takes place a month after Women in Trouble and features some familiar characters with new ones as well.
In all, Gutierrez is able to create a raunchy comedy while straying from the standard Hollywood mold of a testosterone-driven cast.
Great Review Katie!
FYI: More Great News: Women In Trouble will be released to DVD on March 15th 2010!

Hidden in the grid of Downtown Los Angeles, the LA Flower District boasts the title of largest flower wholesale district in the country. Comprised of two main flower markets and individual stores, the district contrasts towering concrete structures with the overpowering smell of plants and people.
The Southern California Flower Mart, located on Wall Street, seems passable from the exterior. A large concrete warehouse, the building seems like something fit for storage.
A steel freight door, left open, lets natural light in to illuminate a table where an attendant checks in visitors. The public pays $2 to enter the mart, while industry professionals who are members of the Flower District Association pass through with their badges proudly displayed.
Inside is your grandmother’s version of Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory: Signs hang from the ceiling demarking separate booths, with an expanse of white plastic buckets filled with bundles of raw-cut flowers below.
The often overlooked green fillers in bouquets and arrangements scatter the gray warehouse as well; lace-like oversize ferns, crisp cuts of Christmas firs and dripping tendrils of sour moss are there for customers to select as they scheme grand-scale productions or dinner party centerpieces.
It’s hard to believe that the mart had once seen better days. At 9 a.m. on a Friday morning, groups of people are running around with carts stocked with hydrangeas and sunflowers in preparation for weddings, funerals and even movies.
It’s easy to get lost in this fragrant labyrinth of mums and gerberas — there’s even a disconcerting upstairs area filled with holiday decorations and seemingly random supplies that include silk flowers, plastic spaghetti, oversized Styrofoam Easter bunnies and chicken figurines made of dolomite.
To keep clients awake and alive, there’s complimentary coffee stations scattered throughout the property. A typical day at work here starts at midnight.
For florists and other trade members, the flower mart opens at 2 a.m. for half of the week so buyers can get the best goods for their shops and events first hand. For the other half, vendors can sleep in because the day starts at 5 a.m.
And as for the general public, doors don’t officially open until 8 a.m.
A floral prop manager for a TV show carts a multi-tiered load around in search for the perfect finishing touches on her set; an engaged couple mills about looking at wedding bouquets. Others are there just for the thrill of it all.
“My daughter’s getting married this weekend, and we’re having the reception at our house,” said Susan Chadney of Hollywood Hills as she clutched a large bundle of chrysanthemums to her chest.
Chadney added as she motioned to her East Coast friend, “Prices are reasonable and it’s fun — it’s something I wanted to take my girlfriend from Pennsylvania to see.”
Depending on the buyers’ needs, desired specimens are then wrapped in newspaper and twine and, if the client feels particularly ambitious, placed gingerly among other protected bundles on an oversized metal crate with multiple levels.
For the past couple of years, however, it is the public that has increased in attendance, instead of the florists that buy from the wholesalers and farmers that reside at the mart.
“Regular florists aren’t doing so well,” said Kathy Yonemitsu of Indio Desert Floral, one of the vendors inside the mart. “More of the public are coming in.”
Kathy and her brother, Ken Yonemitsu, sit at the cash register of their section of the mart on a busy Friday morning. They’re continuing their parents’ flower farm, which was founded 42 years ago. Indio started selling in the mart in 1997.
“Because of the economy, people only buy what they need,” Kathy said as she took a break from selling lilies shipped from the company’s Salinas, Calif. farm. “It used to be a really good business.”
Ken nodded his head in agreement.
“You can get orchids for cheap at Trader Joe’s and Costco now,” he said. “The grocery stores bypass the middleman and go for the wholesaler.”
Because of their convenient availability, part of the flower’s allure has disappeared.
These ornamental plants are the ultimate manifestation of temporary beauty, and yet there is an entire district dedicated to the luxury of decoration. People will still coo at the sight of a bouquet extended to them in a gesture of kindness, or sigh in front of altars laden with blossoms. The mart, in turn, is a shrine to ephemeral beauty.
Many Angelenos take the availability of these flowers for granted, leaving their suburban backyards to the care of gardeners we know only on a first-name basis.
In the meantime, farmers and wholesalers keep selling their living products to those willing to brave the wholesale districts, the equivalent of the commercial Wild West, where buyers can sometimes become uncomfortably close to sellers.
But these vendors also know that times are changing. Shoppers sniff the dirt at the mart for a bargain for their celebrations, but only if Ralph’s roses can’t cut it.
Any farmer knows the fruits of labor depend on the season, however, as Ken names what flowers are available at certain times of the year.
“After all, you can’t stop nature,” he said.

Bye weeks present USC with an opportunity to get healthy, and this one is coming at just the right time.
Four key USC players sat out of practice with a multitude of injuries, but the Trojans did get some good news about one of their playmakers.
Giving it the boot · Damian Williams is out of the protective boot and could start running Monday. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
Redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams remained in sweatpants and did not practice, but he was not wearing a boot on his injured ankle like he was on Tuesday.
Coach Pete Carroll said Williams expects to run on Monday, and he will be evaluated from there.
“He’s encouraged,” Carroll said of the team’s leader in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns.
Running backs redshirt junior Allen Bradford and junior Joe McKnight also missed practice.
Bradford is recovering from a bone bruise in his foot, while Carroll said McKnight was suffering from blurred vision due to migraines.
u
With Williams out, other receivers have had to step up, including junior Ronald Johnson and redshirt freshman Brice Butler.
“We got a lot of guys stepping in, making big plays,” Johnson said. “We’re not really missing a beat, but at the same time, he’s a big key player, we’d love to have him back.”
The duo caught 13 of freshman quarterback Matt Barkley’s 21 completions on Saturday against Stanford. Johnson had seven grabs for 69 yards, while Butler hauled in six grabs for 96 yards and a score.
Johnson has been impressed with Butler’s play.
“He’s really coming up,” the junior said. “He’s learning the game and making plays.”
Johnson continued to impress in his own right during practice, streaking down the left sideline and beating freshman defensive back Byron Moore on a 50-plus-yard touchdown pass from Barkley.
He said he doesn’t feel any added pressure without Williams in the lineup.
“It’s an opportunity,” Johnson said.
u
The open week also gives a number of younger Trojans a chance to get more repetitions in, and a handful of players are taking advantage of that opportunity.
One of those players is Moore.
“We learned some stuff that he hadn’t grasped yet,” Carroll said. “Now we can help him progress.”
Another is freshman offensive tackle Kevin Graf.
“I can’t tell you that he’s set the world on fire yet but he has to battle with the first group when he’s in there,” Carroll said.
Graf’s father, Allan Graf, played three years for USC in the early 1970s, including with the Trojans’ 1972 national championship team. His brother, Derek, lettered in 2002.
Sophomore linebacker Uona Kaveinga also impressed coaches, making a number of stops in 11-on-11 drills.

Nothing compares to the challenge facing coach Pete Carroll right now.
Not preparing for an undefeated Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. Not getting ready to face Vince Young in the Rose Bowl.
His biggest challenge · Pete Carroll has faced many obstacles. Getting his team up for the end of the year may be his toughest yet. - TIm Tran | Daily Trojan
Not convincing prized recruits to come to USC rather than another school. Not assembling one of the greatest offenses in college football history.
No, nothing compares to what Carroll must do now.
He must find a way to motivate a group of young student-athletes who are physically and mentally worn down to win two more regular season games and a meaningless bowl game.
A tall task.
This shouldn’t be a question for the game a week and a half from now. The Trojans shouldn’t need any extra motivation to prepare for this cross-town rivalry.
There’s still something to play for in that game ­­— and there always will be.
USC never wants to lose to UCLA, even if it were in nothing more than a knitting competition.
But what is there to play for a week later against Arizona? The Wildcats still have a chance to win the entire Pac-10 Conference and get to Pasadena.
They will be hungry.
USC? The Trojans are playing for the Sun Bowl, the Las Vegas Bowl, the Emerald Bowl, the Poinsettia Bowl or the Holiday Bowl.
None of those games have the pageantry or the prestige of the Rose Bowl Game.
They’re inconsequential.
Of course, Carroll will never call any game as such, and definitely not a bowl game.
But it’s hard to treat any of those games as more than insignificant, especially when he openly admits that the goal at the beginning of every year is to be in Pasadena on New Year’s Day.
It’s no secret that the Trojans had designs to be there on Jan. 7.
But those plans are all but a distant memory now, as are thoughts of New Orleans, Miami or Glendale, Calif.
Say hello to Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Diego or El Paso, Texas.
Not exactly bastions of college football glory.
It would be hard to blame any of the Trojans for being unenthusiastic about the prospects of playing in any of those games.
Do you think senior safety Taylor Mays signed up for this when he decided to come back for one more season? Do you think freshman quarterback Matt Barkley wanted to be playing in mid-December instead of early January?
Probably not.
And what about the rest of the Trojans? They’re in a world of hurt. They have enough injured players to fill an infirmary ward.
It seems as if every Trojan has been banged up at some point during the season.
Barkley and Mays missed USC’s loss to Washington.
Senior tight end Anthony McCoy was absent for the Trojans’ defeat against Oregon.
Junior wide receiver Damian Williams missed Saturday’s loss to Stanford and remains doubtful for the remainder of the regular season.
The list goes on.
And what about their mental state? It has been a draining season for everyone involved.
One week after an emotional come-from-behind victory at Ohio State, the Trojans were on the road yet again at Washington.
They had to stare across the field at two men who had been mentors — and treat them as enemies.
They went on the road to Ohio State and Notre Dame, and played six of their first nine games away from the Coliseum.
That is tough to ask of any football team, regardless of its caliber.
Not to mention the results on the field, which have been unprecedented in the Carroll era.
When USC finally made it home for good, it was too late — the physical and mental damage had been done.
Now, Carroll must motivate his team for two more grueling football games.
He must guide a worn-out team through uncharted waters toward a port of call they never expected to see.
He must ready his team to bring the same intensity as they would with a Rose Bowl berth on the line — but in this case, with something less in the offing.
This might be Carroll’s toughest challenge of all.

When the USC women’s basketball team faces Gonzaga (1-1) on Thursday in Spokane, Wash., it will mark a couple of firsts for the team.
The game will be the first road contest of the season for the Women of Troy (1-1), who are coming off a 68-63 victory over Fresno State. And it will be the first meeting between the two schools in history.
Up to task · Guard Ashley Corral’s matchup with Gonzaga guard Courtney Vandersloot will renew a rivalry that goes back to high school. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
It will not, however, be the first time sophomore guard Ashley Corral matches up against Bulldogs star Courtney Vandersloot, the reigning WCC Newcomer of the Year.
Corral, a native of Washington, and Vandersloot were rivals in high school and now take that rivalry to the collegiate stage.
“I know she’s a great defensive player and offensive player,” Corral said. “It’s going to take a lot for us to handle her, but I’m used to her game and I think I can [contain] her.”
Corral is not the only person excited to play her old rival. USC coach Michael Cooper said he looked forward to seeing the two lead guards face each other.
“It’s a good test for Ashley at this point and time in the season,” Cooper said. “You’ve got a player who may not be as deft at scoring as you are, but a very good point guard who runs her team extremely well.”
Vandersloot ranked third nationally last season with nearly eight assists per game, and has been performing just as well this season. The main beneficiaries of her passing have been seniors Tiffanie Shives and Heather Bowman, who each average more than 15 points per game.
USC will have to turn in a strong defensive performance if it wants to beat the high-scoring Bulldogs, who return four starters from last season’s 27-win team. Cooper credited his team for playing solid defense through its first two games and said that trend would have to continue.
“We’ve been hanging our hats on [defense] all season,” he said. “Defense can definitely win you some games on the road, and that’s the approach that we’re going to take.”
Briana Gilbreath will be called upon to answer Gonzaga’s high- scoring offense. Gilbreath scored 17 points in USC’s win over Fresno St.
Slowing down the Bulldogs would be difficult enough without having to deal with a hostile crowd, but the Women of Troy will have to face that challenge in Spokane. The Bulldogs enjoy one of the best home court advantages in the country and went 14-3 at home last season.
Still, Cooper does not expect his team to be fazed by the noise or successful home record.
“We’ve been practicing for situations like that where we’re going to treat it as our home court,” he said. “Yes, it’s going to be a little difficult, but nothing we can’t handle.”
It will be incumbent on Corral to settle her team down in front of a hostile crowd where, as one player put it, the opposing team is down 10 points before the game starts.
“It’s a tough environment to play in,” Corral said. “I have to get the team calm and settled, execute the offense and let the game come to me.”
Tip-off is scheduled for 6 p.m.

It was the beginning of another long practice in the middle of the 2008-2009 college basketball season. The Trojans trudged into the locker room and grudgingly changed into their uniforms.
Out of nowhere, then-freshman forward DeMar DeRozan barged into the room, screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs. He picked up and threw anything he could get his hands on.
The next level · Former Trojan DeMar DeRozan, pictured playing against UCLA last year, always knew how to keep the mood light in the USC locker room. DeRozan is now a rookie on the NBA’s Toronto Raptors. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
His bewildered teammates looked at each other, trying to figure out why DeRozan was so angry.
“Then, all of the sudden he started dancing around. It was one big joke, and he was just playing with us,” senior guard Dwight Lewis said. “[DeMar] is really goofy. He was one of the goofiest dudes on the team last year.”
Whether by breaking into song and dance or attempting to shoot the basketball backward across the court to impress his teammates, DeRozan knew how to keep the mood light and prevent daily practices from becoming monotonous.
“It is real important to get that bond with your teammates, and to let them see that you have a sense of humor,” DeRozan, now a player for the NBA’s Toronto Raptors, said before a recent game against the Los Angeles Clippers. “You have to have fun every now and then.”
At USC, DeRozan said he had the time of his life. After growing up on the streets of Compton, DeRozan roomed with teammate and popular hip-hop artist Percy “Romeo” Miller Jr. in Troy Hall. Miller and DeRozan grew up playing together on traveling basketball teams, and Miller refers to DeRozan as his “best friend” who is “like a brother.”
“We have a lot of stories,” Miller said. “[DeRozan] is kind of shy around girls. You wouldn’t think that a top NBA player would be shy around girls, but he is. Me being Romeo, it came naturally, but he was shy. That is why he is such an amazing player. He put basketball first.”
DeRozan would not argue against Miller’s claim.
“[Of course Miller] should be better [with women],” DeRozan said. “He was a number one recording rapper at one point. But I think I got around so I am not worried about it.”
On the court, DeRozan averaged 13.9 points per game and 5.7 rebounds as a freshman. He helped the Trojans win the Pac-10 Tournament, and was named the Pac-10 Tournament MVP.
DeRozan’s success convinced scouts that he was ready for the NBA. DeRozan, however, was torn between returning to USC to avenge the team’s second-round loss in the NCAA tournament, and going to the NBA.
“It was stressful,” DeRozan said. “I talked to everybody. I got everybody’s input. I don’t know everything, so I just try to learn from people.”
However, Miller convinced DeRozan that he needed to think for himself.
“I told him, ‘That is a decision you have to make on your own. You have to go with your heart,’” Miller said. “It is like getting married. I am not going to tell him if it is the right wife or not. He had to make his decision.”
With his mother, Diane DeRozan, who has lupus, DeRozan ultimately decided that his family needed the money that the NBA was offering.
“DeMar told me, ‘You guys can sit down and take it easy. I can take care of you guys because you did so much for me growing up,’” DeMar’s father, Frank DeRozan, said.
The Toronto Raptors drafted DeRozan with the ninth pick in the 2009 NBA Draft, and signed him to a multimillion-dollar contract. One of the first things that DeRozan purchased were fancier clothes to comply with the NBA dress code, after never having owned a suit in college, and warmer clothes to help him survive Toronto winters.
Through Wednesday, DeRozan was averaging 6.1 points per game  with the Raptors. He has played well enough to earn a position in the starting lineup, averaging 17.6 minutes per game.
“We are trying to keep his minutes up, and he has certainly done nothing to have those minutes be cut,” Raptors coach Jay Triano said. “DeMar works hard everyday, he is an excellent student of the game, he wants to learn and get better, and he has an excellent attitude.”
Added the Raptors’ All-Star forward, Chris Bosh, “DeMar brings athleticism, both on the defensive and offensive ends. He has shown that he can really attack the basket and score in the half-court. That was a big thing we were lacking before.”
DeRozan is also a contributor off the court, keeping his teammates in Toronto entertained, often through rookie hazing.
“DeMar brings a lot to this team,” said Raptors’ forward Hedo Turkoglu. “He brings doughnuts, coffee, newspapers and towels to the games before we get into the showers.”
In the NBA, DeRozan may be perceived as nothing more than a lowly rookie, but with the start of the college basketball season arriving, the Trojans are missing his presence.
“If [DeRozan] was still here, we would have a number one team,” Miller said. “We still have a great bunch of guys here, but if you can have the addition of an NBA player, it always helps.”
Miller is not alone in thinking the Trojans would be a top team if DeRozan played his sophomore season at USC.
“I believe that,” DeRozan said. “A lot of things would have been different, but we will never know now.”

While massive amphitheaters and large audiences make for exhilarating shows, The Fray tries to play for smaller, college-town audiences as often as possible. Making its second appearance at USC, the band is excited to perform for USC students again — this time at the Galen Center.
In December 2006, The Fray performed at USC’s annual Conquest event on campus, where the band  was greeted enthusiastically by students.
All at once · Grammy Award-nominated rock band The Fray, which formed in Denver in 2002, recently ended its nationwide tour in promotion of its self-titled sophomore album, The Fray. - Photo courtesy of The Fray
“It was great. Everyone was super friendly and energetic and totally excited that we were there,” said Ben Wysocki, The Fray’s drummer. “That’s always a nice environment to go into.”
Having a smaller audience, especially one filled primarily with college students, changes the overall vibe of the show, Wysocki explained. Inspired by the smaller shows’ unique atmosphere, the band toured a number of colleges in September after spending the summer on big stages in major cities across the country.
The Fray’s summer tour followed the February release of its sophomore album, The Fray, which included the popular single, “You Found Me.” Although seemingly similar upon first listen, Wysocki said that the band’s latest album differs from its extremely successful first album, How to Save a Life, on a deeper level.
“The first one was really great in that it was super naïve. We weren’t over-thinking anything because we didn’t know how,” Wysocki said. “This was only our second record … but we had more confidence. We knew how we’d done it once, so we had a bit more direction going into it.”
Although The Fray is only the second album that Wysocki and the band’s three other members, Isaac Slade, Dave Welsh and Joe King, have recorded together, the bandmates have known each other for many years. Wysocki said he first met Welsh in fourth grade, and Slade and King in junior high and high school.
“Between the four of us, we’ve played in a couple different bands together,” Wysocki said. “We all grew up musically together. Some of us got jobs, went to college, but we all met back up after that.”
The band, whose members are all from Denver, got its name when they performed at Slade’s brother’s high school graduation party. They asked everyone at the party to suggest a name and throw it in a bowl — The Fray was one of the suggestions. The group stuck with it, “mostly because the website wasn’t taken,” Wysocki joked.
From the beginning, The Fray has been influenced by artists from all over the musical realm, but the band was founded on what each of them grew up listening to — bands like Pearl Jam and Counting Crows, Wysocki said. The band’s musical tastes and influences, however, constantly change and expand.
“As we’ve all grown up, it’s changed a lot. The music you’re inspired by grows and morphs and evolves,” he said. “A lot changed when I discovered Radiohead and again when I discovered Wilco.”
Wysocki made it clear that there is plenty of music, whether old or new, to draw inspiration from.
“Being as young as we are, there was loads of great music made before our time, but then there’s also loads of new stuff that’s just as inspiring,” he said. “Pretty much all we do is talk about and listen to music.”
In between finding inspiration in other people’s music and sharing it with the rest of the group, the members of The Fray somehow find time to write, record and perform some awe-inspiring music of its own. Writing music is a group effort, Wysocki said, which usually begins when one of them brings an idea to the table — usually a small slice of a song — and culminates in a collaboration of ideas that result in a full-length track.
It is the time spent in the studio recording these songs that Wysocki said he enjoys the most, though it differs for every band member. But too much time in the studio or on tour usually leaves the whole group craving a change of scenery.
“We’re half creators, half performers,” Wysocki said. “If we spend too long in the studio or on the road, one half gets anxious.”
The band tries to create a balance between the two by booking studios while on tour, where the members can let their creative sides out and boost their attitudes and energy levels, Wysocki said.
Surprisingly, the group’s energy level is at its highest when nervous, Wysocki said. And yes, even after playing in front of large audiences all over the world, the band does still get nervous sometimes.
“We get nervous if we’re trying something new on stage,” Wysocki said. “It’s nice to be nervous sometimes because if all of us are nervous, there’s this kind of energy that we sort of miss. The worst thing is for all of us to get on stage and just go through the motions.”
After playing at the Galen Center and a few other small venues, The Fray will take part in a few radio station holiday concerts alongside other artists. The band plans to start the new year in the studio, working on new music for the entire month of January.
Whether or not the group will produce an entire album, or simply a handful of songs, by the end of next year is still up in the air.
“We’re just going to get in there and create and see what comes out,” Wysocki said.

Can you believe it’s been one year?
A full 365 days!
Fifty-two weeks!
Two seasons of G’s to Gents!
Yes, believe it or not, an entire year has passed since the great chocolate milk debacle of 2008.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
Last year in Barrington, Ill., the school district voted to eliminate all flavored milk products from the lunch menu of elementary and middle school lunches.
The decision, however unpopular, was a calculated move to help curb ever-worsening childhood obesity by forcing the young minds of Barrington to select plain white milk as their beverage of choice
Kids — they grow out so fast these days.
Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed, as a committee of three 10-year-olds worked feverishly to reverse the decision. With the backing of a heavily supported petition, the trio convinced the benevolent school board to temporarily bring back flavored milks to the cafeteria menu — for one day a week.
As ridiculous as the compromise may seem, the issue from which it stems is perhaps even more ludicrous.
Though the plan intends to cut the caloric intake of additive sweeteners, it ignores the fact that the same nutrients found in white milk are found in chocolate milk — they just taste better.
Already a fickle group of eaters, children who were forced to drink only white milk might have avoided the drink altogether.
But as questionable as the decision-making process was in the case of moo juice in Barrington, why cry over chocolate milk?
Trying to declare war on obesity has put our priorities out of order.
There’s no question that the overall fitness level of the American public is below par, especially among youths. In fact, it would be reckless to apply the same “kids will be kids” mentality that brushes aside the casual consumption of paste and occasional public tantrum to the eating practices of kids.
Many 5-year-olds plow through entire boxes of Honeycomb cereal; few would call this a good life habit.
Though the act of micromanaging the eating behaviors of the nation’s youth seems to be nitpicky, it helps to address the problem of obesity at an early stage.
But while a high precedent has been set on correcting the behaviors of the overindulgent, there’s been a dramatic dropoff on the opposite side of the spectrum — helping out those struggling to put food on the table.
There is a big coalition trying to curb obesity; the nation’s hungry don’t have such an avid group of followers.
According to a study released Monday by the Department of Agriculture, 17 million American households (14.6 percent) “had difficulty putting enough food on the table at times during the year,” with hunger in the United States reaching a 14-year high.
The report goes on to state that the number of households in which both adults and children experienced “very low food security” rose by more than half, from 323,000 in 2007 to 506,000 in 2008.
It is curious, then, that the stories we hear most revolve around proposed food taxes and the advent of new diet-conscious products, and that any talk of hunger problems only evokes images of Bono and third-world countries.
For some reason, hunger seems to be a distant issue; we’re not used to hearing that people in our own country are starving every day.
If there was anywhere near the amount of scrutiny that occurred in the so-called “war on obesity,” such numbers would not be nearly as high, with the public taking a vested interest in reducing hunger.
Everyone feels bad for the empty-stomached, especially when they go hungry without reason. Even those convicted of heinous crimes are provided with food on a daily basis.
Unfortunately, it seems that the philanthropic efforts to help out this group are only present during major holiday-themed food drives, whereas hunger is a very real day-to-day issue for those affected.
With an increased level of scrutiny on the trend of hunger in the country, perhaps we could change the mindset that charities only really need volunteers for a fraction of the year.
For all the effort and energy spent trying to help out those that have had one cookie too many, it would be much more prudent to find ways to help out those seeking a crumb.
The morbidly obese are often so because of their free will to limit self control. But does anyone choose to be habitually starving?
We should re-organize our priorities to help restore the balance of help in the realm of eating habits.
Ultimately, working to help those in need of a basic necessity seems to be a much more appetizing prospect than to meddle in petty calorie counting wars to assist those responsible for their own gluttony.

“For some reason, hunger seems to be a distant issue; we’re not used to hearing that people in our own country are starving every day.”
Because they aren’t. We already have welfare, food stamps, free school lunches, and all kinds of other ways of funneling money from those who earn it to those who can’t be bothered. Many of the “hungry” people in America are also in the “obese” category that you write about — getting fat off free lunches.  Have you ever watched a person with food stamps go through the grocery checkout? That’s an eye-opening experience and would make a great topic for a column.

Last month, “Responsible Travel” aborted its nine-year initiative allowing airplane passengers to purchase carbon offsets to compensate for jet fuel emissions — a program that afforded its customers fly-by-night peace of mind, if not any substantive environmental benefits.
The undertaking was reminiscent of the royal flop that was indulgences. Passengers of many major US airlines were given the opportunity to spend anywhere from $5 to $40 to effectively buy back the environmental footprints (or contrails) made by airplane emissions.
All collected money was donated to various programs around the world that reduce emissions — such as forestation projects — with the ostensible goal of canceling out each passenger’s imprint.
It seemed like a clever way to help offset the growing problem of jet fuel emissions, which are increasing exponentially.
But as a recent New York Times article pointed out, the donations were hardly the number needed to really make a trip carbon neutral. The actual amount would probably be equal to or more than the cost of the ticket itself.
The system did its job to assuage lip-service green travelers, but did little to actually reverse the damage of air travel. Martin Luther would be turning in his grave, if he wasn’t already peeved at the Catholic Church for trying to undo the Great Schism.
The problem of jet fuel emissions is an issue that must be addressed, especially as more customers travel by plane. A recent British study found that the amount of carbon emitted per passenger in one flight from London to Los Angeles is equal to what an English commuter produces in one year through bus, train or car travel.
It is clear that retroactive moves  to reduce emissions are ineffective. The problem should be addressed at its source: the planes themselves.
Some airlines are already making incremental changes to their fleets. EasyJet, for example, which was started in 1995, has made strides to engineer jets that fit more rows of seats, and makes efforts to make sure these seats are filled by takeoff.
These, and other initiatives to make the planes more fuel-efficient, have reduced each plane’s carbon emissions by 28 percent.
Other airlines would do well to follow this example, but the carbon neutrality can also be approached by customers.
Private jets produce far more carbon per passenger than commercial planes, making scenic tours over the city  not just financially superfluous.
Offsets have convinced many fliers that they are doing their environmental duty; therefore, fewer people are looking for ways to fly smarter. It’s easier to appease egos, but harder to encourage change.
Flying has become  a staple of modern transportation, but it can and should be approached with caution.

Right of way
I was excited to see the issue of pedestrian safety and traffic code infringement make front-page news on Wednesday, Nov. 18. The article exposed all sides of the issue, from the student bicyclist perspective to the student pedestrian perspective (albeit lacking some conviction), and also the perspective of DPS officials.
I have been a student pedestrian at USC for the past four years, and I usually enjoy most of my commute to and from campus.
However, each year that passes I see the distance between bicyclists and pedestrians grow wider. I have been marauded by bicycle traffickers and hit on the way to and from class, left with only a “Sorry!” and a bruise (sometimes offenders simply bike away in rage).
Imagine this happening with a motor vehicle. In a time when motorcycle accidents are at an all-time high in California, we need to be looking at everyone’s safety and convenience, rather than merely our own. I say with a sense of humor that I have been forced to practice “defensive walking,” just as one might practice “defensive driving” in heavy traffic. I would like to remind all bicyclists that it is not the responsibility of the pedestrian to avoid a bicycle hurtling directly toward him. The opposite is actually true, and this situation is usually harrowing.
How soon we, as students, forget that we all have rights in traffic. While I agree that the mentioned fines for traffic violations are excessive (and should be protested), the principle of the matter remains that the original violations are still occurring, and students, staff, faculty, and visitors on foot are all at risk for physical injury. Students of USC are not exempt from these traffic laws or any other laws, despite the prevalence of this mode of thinking.
Do you know your traffic code? After reading the article I decided to brush up on city ordinances and want to share the relevant code summaries with my colleagues:
Bicyclist rights (CVC 21200): Bicyclists have all the rights and responsibilities of vehicle drivers.
The key word here is responsibilities. I think a consensus can be reached that students largely do not care for these responsibilities and require enforcement as well as a deterrent (such as a fine in the hundreds of dollars) in order to understand that the days in which they are not receiving tickets are freebies. The idea that these “fining” days (which I believe used to occur every Thursday) are excessive in number is absurd to me as a pedestrian.
Use of the roadway (CVC 21202): Bicycles traveling slower than the normal speed of traffic must ride as close to the right side of the road as practicable except: when passing, preparing for a left turn, to avoid hazards and dangerous conditions, or if the lane is too narrow.
Direction of travel (CVC 21650): Bicyclist must travel on the right side of the roadway in the direction of traffic.
Enough said. These aren’t being followed at all.
However, the administration as well as city officials aren’t holding up their end of the bargain, either:
Bicycle lane use (CVC 21208): Bicyclists traveling slower than traffic must use bike lanes except when making a left turn, passing or avoiding hazardous conditions.
So, where are the bike lanes? The problem is that with more students come, constriction of once-free pedestrian thoroughfares. The editorial, “Bike regulation requires a more cohesive plan,” from the editorial staff hit the nail on the head when it stated cooperation with all parties is key.
One last thing: The idea that LAPD officers should be spending their time with other matters is absolutely correct. So, why don’t we allow them to focus on more “important” matters by upholding our end of the bargain? Let’s reserve civil disobedience for laws that actually discriminate or infringe upon our civil liberties.

You are talking about bikes while our planet is being destroyed by man-made Global Warming!  Get a clue!
“Enough said. These aren’t being followed at all.”  These rules are being followed, but the cyclists who don’t follow the rules might make a bigger impression.
@ Chris: I was misquoted by the editorial staff. My original editorial read, “enough said. This one isn’t being followed at all.” I didn’t mean to state that all bicyclists are ignoring the rules 100% of the time. I agree that some bicyclists surely obey the law, but those who do not make a bigger impression. I would definitely say we have more rulebreakers than followers, however, just from experience. ;)
@ Wanda: Clue obtained. I’m glad people ride bikes if they are doing it to help avoid climate change, but I sincerely doubt this is what is happening. Again, it seems to be more a choice of convenience and cost. There’s a time and a place for every debate. If we all get killed in traffic we won’t be able to talk about climate change! ;) Just commenting on the relevant side of things!

The Trojans returned to the field Tuesday for the first time since their 55-21 loss to Stanford on Saturday.
There, they got some more bad news.
It looks as if redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams will miss practice for at least the rest of the week with an ankle injury.
Sitting this one out · The injury that kept wide receiver Damian Williams out of last week’s game may be worse than originally thought. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
Williams originally suffered the injury on a 75-yard touchdown catch against Arizona State earlier this month.
It was initially determined to be a high ankle sprain; now, Williams says it might be worse — a stress reaction, or even a stress fracture.
“It’s almost like a real bad bruise,” he said on his way out of practice Tuesday. “It’s just always sore.”
Williams, who wouldn’t rule himself out of playing against UCLA on Nov. 28, still requires a boot to walk.
“The sooner I get out of the boot, the closer I am to playing,” Williams said. “While I’m in this thing, the worse my chances look.”
In other injury news, redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford and redshirt freshman receiver Brice Butler both left practice early.
Bradford has a bone bruise in his foot, while Butler’s back injury that sidelined him briefly last month is bothering him again.
Butler said he wouldn’t be sidelined for an extended period of time.
Sophomore safety Drew McAllister took part in most full-speed drills in his return to Howard Jones Field after missing the last three games with a hip flexor.

The Trojans have managed to stick together in the aftermath of Saturday’s 55-21 loss, and they say they’re using it as a learning experience.
“We learned that if we don’t play as a team, then any team in our conference can beat us and any team in the nation can beat us,” said junior running back Joe McKnight, who rushed for 142 yards against the Cardinal. “And as long as we have that focus as a team, we can do anything in front of us.”
Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley said the road to recovery starts with the team’s veterans, who are already taking on a positive attitude.
“The leaders are and the starters are and it’s trickling on down,” Barkley said. “It was pretty down over the weekend and even a little bit [Monday], but you can tell things are up today.”
Junior center Kristofer O’Dowd added that each of the team’s players has to take equal responsibility for the loss.
“You can’t really put the blame on somebody,” O’Dowd said. “It takes all 11 on both sides of the ball. If one guy has a mistake, then the whole team falters.”

Bye weeks are — for the Trojans, at least — known as a time for young players to stand out, as coaches tend to give more repetitions to backups with less pressure to prepare for an opponent.
USC coach Pete Carroll spotlighted a number of players likely to see the field more in practice this week, including freshmen safeties Jawanza Starling and T.J. McDonald and freshman offensive lineman Kevin Graf.
“I think it’s really important for our program to present our guys with competitive situations as much as possible,” Carroll said. “To give them an opportunity to see where they are, and so they can learn and so that we can learn and we can make progress with them.”
Carroll also said that backup quarterbacks redshirt junior Mitch Mustain and redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp are receiving more snaps than usual this week.
“Practice, for me, has been kinda fun,” Corp said. “You get to play free and just run around and have a good time.”

USC men’s water polo is good. Really, really good.
That much we know.
Since the 2006 season, the Trojans have run up a collective 95-6 record for a robust .940 winning percentage. They went 29-0 in 2008 on their way to a fourth national title and have lost just one match so far this year.
Keeping it close · Senior driver Justin Rappel led the USC men’s water polo team to another nailbiting win against Stanford last week. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
But take a closer look and you’ll find a common theme, one you might not expect: The Trojans don’t win big. They win small.
This comes in direct contrast to what you would usually expect from a No. 1 team. Take the Lakers, for example — some LA fans get outraged whenever they don’t blow a team out.
But Saturday, No. 1 USC beat No. 3 Stanford in as close a match as you’ll ever see at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
Senior driver Justin Rappel scored with 10 seconds left to give the Trojans a 12-11 lead, but the Cardinal fought back to tie it and force overtime.
Rappel scored again in the extra period and sophomore goaltender Joel Dennerley kept Stanford scoreless to clinch the 13-12 victory. Sounds exciting, right?
It was, but it was also business as usual.
That was the fourth one-goal victory the Trojans have had this season. And that doesn’t include five other victories that came by a margin of three or less.
“It shows that we have the poise and confidence to not be shaken by a close game,” said senior two-meter Jordan Thompson, who had a career-high four goals against the Cardinal. “Or, in the case of Stanford, to not be shaken by a late deficit. We all know that we can do it when it comes down to crunch time.”
Yes, they can.
And they use crunch time as a learning experience, too.
“At the same time, these close wins show us where our weaknesses are,” Thompson added. “Obviously against Stanford, we had a great offensive attack — 13 goals — but we allowed 12 goals. There were some issues, so now we are making adjustments.”
To put it simply, they know how to perform in the clutch.
“We play like our lives are on the line every game — it’s just the team mentality,” Rappel said. “We refuse to lose and we don’t see it as an option, whereas other teams are content to have a losing record, I guess.”
But it’s not like this is a new phenomenon.
The Trojans did this last year too, with five one-goal wins and several come-from-behind victories.
And nearly every key contributor from that team is back this time around.
“We’ve all been here before,” Rappel said. “We’ve all been in these close games and no one’s freaking out about it. Everyone stays calm and does what we need to do to win.”
The team’s chemistry is evident.
“It’s just a huge advantage,” Thompson said. “We know — almost to an infinitesimal fraction — exactly what our teammates want: when they want the ball, where they want it, how they want it.”
Thompson told the story of last year’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title game in vivid detail.
The Trojans fell behind 2-1 late in the game and faced the prospect of losing their first match of the year to Pepperdine. But Rappel equalized with little more than a minute left and then-junior two-meter Shea Buckner delivered the game-winning goal as the buzzer sounded to give USC the dramatic road victory.
From there, it was all downhill, they say.
“The fact that we’ve been to the top of the mountain lets us know that we can get there again,” Thompson said. “And we are going to overcome the obstacles that are in our way.”
And Rappel said some of that late-game fortitude can be traced back to practices, where coach Jovan Vavic’s training methods have been known to be perhaps the most intense in the nation.
The 47-year-old prides his players on being able to maintain their water polo skills, even when their bodies are threatening to break down.
If they reach 180, even 200 heartbeats per minute? That’s nothing.
“Once you’re tired, that’s when the real work begins,” Rappel said. “That’s when you really gotta buckle down and stick to the fundamentals.”
And Vavic, in his 15th year with the Trojans, presides over it all. Owner of a .846 career winning percentage at the college level, he’s been named Coach of the Year — nationally and MPSF — five of the last six seasons.
His teams just win.
“And when you win as many games as we do, you just have confidence,” Vavic said. “And confidence is a big part of being successful in sports.
“We just think that we are going to win every game.”
Of course, USC did lose once this year — once again by a one-goal margin. UCLA beat the Trojans 5-4 in the preseason NorCal Tournament.
Thompson called it a “phenomenal slap in the face.”
But the Trojans’ goaltender and key underclassman — Dennerley — missed the entire week of practice and wasn’t at his best, Vavic said.
It’s clear the loss struck a nerve with Vavic and his team, and the Trojans have come right back and beat UCLA twice since then.
And guess what the margins of victory were?
Yep. One, each time.
