When a dead Magellenic penguin washed up on a beach in Brazil in late September, no one knew the exact cause of the tragedy. In the past, malnutrition and exhaustion have been the main causes of penguins’ death during their migration. However, local biologists later discovered a black, undegradable N95 face mask tangled in the penguin’s stomach.
Ever since the coronavirus outbreak became a pandemic in mid-March, more and more countries have advised their citizens to stop large gatherings and to wear facial coverings in public places. Subsequently, countries and specific regions saw sharp rises in the inappropriate littering of face masks. An article from the Daily Mail reported that one of the most popular tourist beaches in Britain was polluted by more than 100 face masks during a beach cleanup in late September. 
Although a group of volunteers tried their best to retrieve most of the masks, there were still many left on the beach. Similar incidents happened in France and Japan, with reports of divers and volunteers picking up masks in the water around the coasts. A recent survey conducted by the environmental group OceanAsia found 70 discarded masks within 100 yards of a beach in Hong Kong. When they returned a week later, they found 30 additional masks.
People should be alarmed by these numbers for many reasons. The main problem with single-use face masks is that they are non-degradable. Although disposable face masks, which are a part of personal protective equipment, look like a measly piece of fabric, they actually consist of unrecyclable plastic and a strip of metal that people use to fix the mask on the nose. These non-degradable materials include microplastics that contain toxic chemicals. If managed carelessly, the microplastics may go into waterways and pose a threat to the environment. Moreover, the United Nations estimated that 75% of used face masks ultimately end up in landfills or the ocean because of irresponsible littering and governments’ waste mismanagement.
Based on the number of face masks that have been produced and used worldwide, the improper littering of only 1% of face masks could add up to weigh a whopping 66,000 to 88,000 pounds. If a face mask is carelessly discarded at the beach, its non-degradable components can gradually sink below the sand and reach the seafloor. This will cause serious environmental pollution, inflicting harm to marine animals and eventually affecting local fisheries and tourism. 
As face masks become as common as plastic bags and party cups in people’s lives, guidance should be provided on proper face-mask recycling. To reduce the risks of face-mask pollution, the basic solution would be to throw single-use face masks into lidded garbage cans instead of littering them. For the safety of wild animals, the straps of single-use face masks should be cut off before discarding so that animals will not get tangled up in the masks. 
Aside from this, people should ensure they practice social distancing to altogether reduce the need to wear masks so frequently. Because face masks do not need to be used at home, people should consider spending more time at home instead of being out and about in public or attending large gatherings — which they shouldn’t be attending during a global pandemic anyway.
Meanwhile, governments should also increase their efficiency in waste management to prevent further pollution caused by face masks. They must adopt better waste collection plans and invest in recyclable face masks. The United Nations recommends that governments promote the production of non-toxic, biodegradable and easily recyclable face masks, which use materials including natural fibers and rubber. These products protect the environment and provide more job opportunities for countries that are known for supplying these materials. However, the most important thing governments should do is work hard to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus so that the pandemic and the need for face masks can end.
The tragedy of the Magellanic penguin should ring alarm bells for everyone who cares about the environment and should help them realize the potential threats disposable face masks impose. Though it’s still important to wear face masks whenever necessary, people can make a difference by acting responsibly and engaging in proper usage and disposal.

While Alexa Demie is best known for her role as Maddy Perez, the bold cheerleader with a flawless rhinestone cat eye on HBO’s “Euphoria,” the actress can also transcend time and space. According to Twitter, Demie witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall, posed for the Mona Lisa painting and escaped on a lifeboat from the Titanic all while dressed in her iconic two-piece set. 
“She has lived a thousand lives,” read the viral tweet that inspired these memes showing seemingly dated pictures of Demie standing alongside the Kardashian sisters, Grimes, Sky Ferreira and Azealia Banks. The tweet called into question Demie’s actual age, which multiple outlets reported as 24 during the “Euphoria” press tour in 2019. A resurfaced alumni list from her high school claiming that she graduated in 2008, which would make her 29 or 30, added to the speculation. 
Although these are just allegations, Demie’s “timelessness” swept Twitter as fans expressed their shock over how young she looks for 30. While I realize Demie is just another celebrity swept up in a fleeting internet conspiracy, the fixation on her being 25 versus 30 points to a larger issue of ageism in Hollywood. 
If Demie did lie about her age, I can’t blame her. According to a 2015 Time magazine study, actresses reach their professional pinnacle at age 30 but quickly see opportunities for roles decline as they approach middle age. Conversely, actors experience the peak of their careers at age 46 and often work with younger female leads. By fudging a few years, Demie may have bought herself more time as a young starlet before she hits the ripe old age of 35. Not to mention, Demie is also Mexican American, making it even more difficult for her to secure roles. 
The Demie Twitter frenzy is in a similar vein as ageist online responses to Shakira and Jennifer Lopez’s Super Bowl halftime show in January. Rather than focusing on their performance that paid homage to Latinx culture, many Twitter users fixated on Lopez’s physique as a woman in her 50s. 
Lopez is an entertainer. Her job is to maintain her appearance and stay fit for performances by keeping to a strict diet and exercise regimen. So, of course, Lopez looks incredible, but then again, she’s been a dancer for over 30 years. But the shock over Lopez’s ability to perform well despite being “middle-aged” reflects the assumptions people make about women over 50. In our youth-obsessed culture, we rarely see depictions of older women as desirable. Lopez’s performance challenged this ageist notion by embracing her physicality on stage with revealing outfits and elaborate choreography. 
Lopez’s age also became the focal point of “Hustlers” discourse. Despite Lopez’s performance as Ramona Vega, the seasoned stripper who devised a scam to steal thousands of dollars from her clients, being one of the best of her career, social media fixated on her body and “surprising” beauty as an older woman. 
This ageist dialogue concerning Demie and Lopez has been described by 88-year-old Puerto Rican actress Rita Moreno of “West Side Story” fame, who complained in a 2014 Variety interview about facing a trifecta of discrimination in Hollywood.
“All my life I faced sexism and racism and then when I hit 40, ageism,” Moreno said.
As she’s gotten older, Moreno struggled to find consistent roles until being cast in the “One Day at a Time” revival, which follows a Cuban American family. 
Demographic data contradicts negative conceptions of aging in the Latinx community. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, Latinx Americans enjoy a longer life expectancy of 81.8 years compared to 78.8 years for non-Latinx white people. Despite enduring discrimination and lower rates of health insurance, Latinx people experience longevity in their lives. Researchers deem this the “Hispanic paradox,” as they are perplexed over how Latinx peoples’ socioeconomic disadvantages aren’t connected to shorter lives like for other racial and ethinc groups. 
Considering these findings and the fact that Latinx people are projected to represent 29% of the population in 2050, Hollywood must begin to develop substantive roles for older Latinx people, even those without Lopez’s body or Demie playing a younger character.

In the first piece I wrote for the Daily Trojan, I concluded that accountability is a central tenet of all team sports. Holding others accountable may seem daunting, but this past week I experienced how easy it is when an urgent matter is driving you.
Last week, our coaching staff made us aware that teams across USC Athletics are challenging each other to be fully registered to vote. Following this announcement, the men’s volleyball coaches stated it would be a personal choice among players to register, and they would not pressure us. 
When I read that, however, I felt the same sense of urgency in my gut as when I am competing and my team is down and in need of an answer. Despite the power that the coaching staff’s words hold, I felt the need to put that responsibility on my back and compel my teammates to vote. After telling players and staff that participating in the democratic process is a civic responsibility rather than a choice, I recommended voting as an effective first step to returning volleyball to USC safely.
I ended my message to the group in similar fashion as I ended my first column: “Hold each other and yourselves accountable.”
A couple days later, I was tasked by the coaching staff with ensuring complete voter registration of the men’s volleyball roster. When I took up the job, I was just coming back from a doctor’s appointment with a midterm looming on my mind. I initially thought this would be a huge project, but as I started to send out individual texts, I realized it really wasn’t hard at all. After additional links were sent and two teammates registered, all 30 of us, including coaches, were set to vote in the upcoming election. The first part of the job, registration, was complete. 
What I thought would take a week took all of four hours. With less than four weeks until Election Day, the United States needs to ensure better voter turnout than seen in the 2016 general election, when 60.1% of voting eligible people had ballots counted — meaning nearly four in 10 of those eligible to vote did not do so.
Although I was not eligible to vote in the 2016 general election, I don’t quite remember the push to vote that I have seen this year across much of U.S. media and pop culture. For people who have registered to vote or those who have already voted, it may be tedious to tell Instagram or Facebook that you’re all set. On the other hand, it’s astounding to see how many entities have held us all accountable. Hell, even SoundCloud was not going to be left out.
Voter registration may be the easiest part of the process because it is non-partisan. No one is telling you how to vote, just to vote. 
After I made sure everyone was registered, I was then tasked by the coaches with step two of educating the team on the election itself. I hoped that the first presidential debate would educate some of the team on the policies of both candidates, but instead of a debate we received nearly two hours of interruptions that left many dissatisfied.  
So I sit here right now wondering how to properly “educate” a team of college volleyball players in a country that has been recently consumed by hyper-political activism on both sides. As I ruminate on how to properly balance my responsibilities given by my coach and my moral and political beliefs, I can only hope that every vote is actually counted. 
I have been equal parts optimistic and pessimistic about the act of voting come November. With the absence of many in-person sports, many institutions including USC have volunteered arenas such as Galen Center as polling stations. I have seen absentee ballots sent out and delivered and the process has already started for millions of Americans.
Now, as President Donald Trump continues to question the legitimacy of mail-in voting, it leaves me concerned that much of the work people are doing to get people out to vote will not count because of a political tactic. 
A primary goal of USC men’s volleyball in our “Methodology and Process to Attain and Maintain Competitive Excellence” is to “provide clarity of collective and individual goals, built upon integrity and accountability.” Moving forward, with less than a month before Election Day, every voter is responsible for the same goal. When you cast your ballot, you are accountable for clearly understanding not just your own goals but your goals for the country’s future. 
Make sure to check out www.vote.org/ to solidify your plan to vote!

National Basketball Players Association President Chris Paul discussed his recent activism and newfound interest in film production Monday in a Zoom Q&A hosted by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. Led by Annenberg Dean Willow Bay and student co-moderators Toni Hall, Sam Arslanian and Reagan Griffin Jr., the conversation,with more than 300 participants, covered Paul’s role as NBPA president during the unprecedented time in the NBA bubble.
Paul, who recently finished his 15th season in the NBA, is arguably one of the best point guards in NBA history. Currently on the Oklahoma City Thunder roster, Paul is a 10-time All Star and has served as NBPA president for the last seven years. 
Paul discussed embracing his leadership role as the voice for NBA players, citing an NBPA health insurance program to give retired players health care as his proudest accomplishment as president.
“You get a lot of push back because you have 400 or something players,” Paul said. 
Paul’s role as NBPA president was  tested most in developing the plan for the NBA bubble and handling issues inside of it. Many players didn’t want to continue the NBA season after it was initially suspended March 11 due to coronavirus concerns and the possibility of the season moving attention away from the Black Lives Matter movement.
“One thing that I got a chance to do was become more educated,” Paul said. “I talked to a number of people about the different issues and how we could make sure our voices are heard.”
The NBA continued its season in late July at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Fla., inviting 22 of the 30 NBA teams to conclude the regular season and hold the playoffs. Alongside strict coronavirus protocols, the NBA used the bubble as a platform for the Black Lives Matter movement, designing courts with the phrase “Black Lives Matter” and allowing players to wear phrases on the back of their jerseys including “Say Her Name,” “Power to the People” and “Sí, Se Puede.”
Going off his role in creating the NBA bubble, Paul announced Sunday night during the NBA Finals broadcast that the NBPA was able to get more than 90% of the league’s players to register to vote. Paul noted how in the last two elections, only 20% of players voted, so Paul and the NBPA made it a priority to register players.
“It was really nice [on Sunday] to announce that we got over 90% because we have such a young league too,” Paul said. “So, this would be a lot of guys in our league first time voting, and there’s a lot of international guys who can’t vote so it was a really dope feeling to announce that.”
Apart from his work in the NBA, Paul spoke briefly about his personal life and current journey in seeking a communications degree at Winston-Salem State University, a historically Black university that his father attended. He also discussed his dedication to his family, citing it as the reason he wouldn’t coach in the NBA after retiring from his playing career.
Paul also spoke about his work with the film production company he founded, Ohh Dip!! Productions. Specializing in documentaries, Paul shared his love for filmmaking and storytelling. The Zoom event showcased the trailer for one of Paul’s most recent works, “Blackballed,” a Quibi documentary detailing the events following the leak of former Clippers owner Donald Sterling’s racist comments that ultimately led to his selling of the team. 
“I love how family-oriented he is,” said event attendee Nicole Antounian, a junior studying journalism. “You don’t hear about professional basketball players in the league being obsessed with their families, so it was very welcoming and touching.”

Endless assignments, unforgiving professors and dysfunctional technology — the pixelated landscape of “Zoom University” — have not been kind to already-overworked students. In a state of continued isolation and anxiety, college students have continually expressed their struggle to feel motivated and focused, especially without access to the commodities available on a college campus. 
Although USC recently acknowledged potential mental difficulties in its Oct. 6 Fall Community Health Update, its emphasis on “self-care” and “spending time with family” shifted responsibility to students and parroted the same empty platitudes that the school has always expressed. Not all students have a “strong emotional support network” — merely sending out hotlines is not an effective way to offer the kind of support so many students need.
With the rise of the coronavirus, mental health in the United States has steadily declined, with symptoms of anxiety disorders becoming more and more prevalent. According to a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms of anxiety have reached 25.5% of respondents, a three-fold increase from 2019. Similarly, the frequency of symptoms of depressive disorder has increased four times since last year, reaching a staggering 24.3% among those surveyed. 
Clearly, a second, more silent pandemic has taken root. It is also important to note that these mental health conditions have disproportionately affected marginalized populations — particularly, Latinx and Black persons have experienced a more potent decline in mental health.
The worrying effect stated above is even more pronounced in people aged 18 to 24, where 74.9% reported symptoms of a mental health condition. The stress of a global pandemic and a dismal job market have compounded existing college anxiety. We have been isolated from our friends and support systems; some students have had to return to less-than-ideal home situations. A mountain of online assignments, extracurricular obligations, home responsibilities and physical isolation have led to an exacerbation of existing mental struggles. Internships and shadowing opportunities have been ripped away. Students who have moved back to their home states and were already seeking treatment may be forced to find another provider due to state licensing laws. Add heavy coursework on top of all this, and it’s no wonder 11:59 p.m. deadlines haunt our dreams.
Basically, life sucks right now — and because of a deeply rooted stigma, no one seems to be having the necessary conversations to effectively address this mental health crisis. 
Awareness is key to dismantling this stigma. 
This week is Mental Illness Awareness Week, and awareness is more important now than ever. Awareness means acknowledging that we’re struggling. It means educating ourselves on all the different forms mental illness can take, from minor episodes to severe illness. Above all, it means recognizing that we’re not alone. It’s okay if we’re feeling like crap right now — we just need to do something about it and having conversations like these is a great place to start.
It seems like a lot is out of our control as students right now, but the University has the power and resources to help. We at USC’s chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness urge USC to truly make mental wellness a priority. This means a standardized, more forgiving absence policy that allows for mental health days, increasing the number of available counselors for crisis intervention, educating professors on how to help struggling students, helping students find resources in whatever state they’re in and acknowledging shortcomings in the current system and asking students for suggestions. 
USC has never adequately emphasized mental health (even before this pandemic) and these cracks in support have just been exacerbated by the current situation. 
While USC has asserted that it is striving to improve student well-being, the University has consistently failed to bring about meaningful change. As an institution that has experienced its own share of tragedy, the University should have made mental health a clear priority much earlier on. Professors need to discuss the clear mental health issues on campus and prioritize a healthy academic environment, one where students feel empowered to address the mental health issues they are suffering from. 
Students are struggling. It’s time for USC to act on its promises.

The Undergraduate Student Government advocated for a change to the grading system for the fall semester at Tuesday’s Senate meeting after a circulating petition created by students urged the administration to adopt a pass/no pass option for courses. 
The petition calls for the University to consider the conditions many students are facing during the ongoing pandemic. The petition, created Saturday, has more than 2,600 signatures at the time of publication. 
“Please, with all that is going on do not try to bring our grades back to our ‘normal’ grading system,” the petition read. “The world we are living in right now is not normal and our grading system should reflect that. Classes have not gotten any easier but the state of the world is much, much harder than it was at the beginning of this year.”
Sen. Dario Arganese brought up the petition to the Senate after receiving feedback from undergraduate students in text messages regarding the issue. In these messages, students asked Arganese about the feasibility of the pass/no pass option, if the USC administration was looking into student concerns and if the Senate could speak with the administration about a solution.
“A lot of USC students recently have been contracting COVID,” Arganese said. “They essentially have to both catch up for the weeks or a week that they missed and make sure that they’re keeping on track once they are healed … So I feel like offering the pass/no pass option could be really beneficial for students.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, USG President Gabe Savage said he had discussed the possibility of a pass/no pass semester with Provost Charles Zukoski back in August. Savage emphasized the need for the option as students are dealing with financial instability, sickness, grief and loss. 
“That’s really where students are finding themselves in places of greater need,” Savage said. “It’s in those areas that reducing the stress associated with the grades this semester is going to do good things for students who have to worry about so much more than just being a student right now.” 
Zukoski did not respond to requests for comment on the possibility of a pass/no pass semester policy for the fall. 
Savage, who also signed the petition, stated his support and called for the administrators’ attention on the issue. 
“This administration must acknowledge that being a student during these times doesn’t even begin to compare to what it means to be a student under normal circumstances,” Savage wrote in the petition’s comment section.  
Wary of such a change in grading, Sen. Jack Rasmussen said pass/no pass was implemented during the spring semester and applying it now would be unfair to students who have worked hard for their grades during the fall semester. 
“I was very cognizant of Sen. Rasmussen’s opinion pertaining to if there was a universal pass/no pass system, that it would be unfair to students that do put a lot of time and effort into the classes every day,” Arganese said. “That’s a really valid point. But I also appreciated the other opinions regarding different systems of implementing this pass/no pass such as making it not universal, giving students an option to opt in or out so they could still get the letter grade.”
During the meeting, Sen. Shreya Chanda said that while it is important to maintain the integrity of the classroom, the problems that caused USC to accept the pass/no pass option during the spring semester are still applicable this semester. 
Sen. Ruben Romeo said he and other senators would review mental health needs during the pandemic to understand and advocate for proposals like the pass/no pass options depending on students’ needs. 
“We’re focusing on a study for positive mental health strategies during COVID-19,” Romeo said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “But in order to get positive mental health strategies during this, you also have to know what they had to overcome, what makes them resilient, what they’re facing as a stressor.” 
The Senate also discussed updates to the Fall 2020 Budget Proposal and increasing budgets for certain USG programming committees. The proposal was presented by Savage at last week’s meeting after a decrease of USG funds by nearly 90%. The budget was drastically cut by the University to reduce student fees.
The amendment presented to the Senate was to increase the Concerts Committee budget from $95,000 to $97,000 and the Trojan Pride Committee budget from $1,500 to $1,600. 
Last week’s meeting revealed that USG had a total of $363,000 in available funds, with $262,500 allocated to programming organizations.
