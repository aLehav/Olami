Over the last five years, hundreds of students from low-income schools in Los Angeles have come to USC’s campus for College Access Day, a day-long event for sophomores and juniors in high school.
College Access Day is the brainchild of John Pascarella, an associate professor of clinical education at the USC Rossier School of Education, chair of the Master of Arts in teaching programs and resident faculty member at Marks Tower. The product of a low-income single-parent household, Pascarella reflects on his early experiences shaped his current work.
“I was raised by a mother who didn’t have her education,” Pascarella said. “As a young person, in a low-income, single parent household, Mom moved us a lot — I lived in 18 homes, I went through once and calculated every single place we ever lived.”
Having attended 13 schools by the time of his high school graduation, Pascarella said guidance counselors often weren’t sure how to handle his multiple transcripts and constant moves.
“When you show up to a new school and you have transcripts from multiple schools, your guidance counselor kind of shakes his or her head and says, ‘So how long do I have you? Where are you going next?’” Pascarella said.
Despite the initial obstacles to getting to college, Pascarella is quick to clarify that unlike many of the students who attend College Access Day, he is not a first-generation college student. His grandfather attended college, and his mother eventually completed her degree, 25 years after taking her first college course. Her insistence on her son’s education served as a motivation for him.
“There was always a very, very strong encouragement from my mom,” Pascarella said. “’You will go to college. You will get your degree. You will do it in four years.’”
He did just that, double majoring in African American studies and English literature. Several years later — though not many, as Pascarella is young (he was 29 when he was hired in 2010) — and Pascarella has also attained postgraduate degrees, a masters of teaching and a Ph.D. in culture and values in education. Currently directing the teacher training program at Rossier, he has also taught high school at low-income schools in New Jersey. He is the teacher’s teacher, so to speak.
Pascarella said that what he found missing at his own schools growing up, and in his own educational experience, was not a lack of ambition, but rather a lack of “cultural capital.”
“I don’t want to ever give the impression that low-income kids don’t know what it takes to get into college,” Pascarella said.
Such cultural capital often comes from a young person’s parents, mentors or other people who know about the college application process, when to apply and how to prepare for SAT and AP exams, for example.
“I saw teacher education as a powerful venue for change, to change the way we prepare teachers, to prepare the best teachers to work in the places we need them most,” Pascarella said of how he came to find his calling. “That’s ultimately why I went on for a Ph.D. — to be a teacher educator.”
Jeanmarie Levy, a graduate residential college coordinator for Webb Tower and current Master of Education student, said that Pascarella’s drive is apparent in his work.
“[Pascarella’s] very big on motivating us to remember the why of why we’re planning College Access Day, and providing the mission and vision of the event to make the catalyst of what it’s become today,’” said Levy, who is a first-generation college student herself. 
She has helped Pascarella plan College Access Day for the last two years.
She also said that planning the event has helped re-emphasize her own goals.
“It’s shown me that my values really are in outreach and retention of college students and helping students get into college,” Levy said. “Once I graduate I’ll be pursuing a career in this type of work and helping students from these kinds of under-represented backgrounds, first-generation students like myself get into college.”
Beyond College Access Day, which Pascarella envisions growing every year at USC, he has also led a team effort along with other faculty to redesign the graduate program in teacher education that places teacher practice at the center of the coursework.
“We are piloting it — it’s a different way of doing teacher education we haven’t seen done before,” Pascarella said of the program, the initial 18-month phase of which is scheduled to launch in the Fall 2018.
Pascarella also has an eye toward the future. He said he finds himself pondering how even further education, like a law degree, could help him in his desire to see expanded access to education and teacher training.
“My interest is in affecting change for the public good, and the way I do that is through the conduit of teacher education reform, and I believe that education reform, teacher preparation reform, has to happen at the program level,” Pascarella said. “The policy level helps — state and federal policy — but we as programs have to reshape ourselves to be more powerful, more effective, innovative and do so with impact.”

The National Science Foundation, a U.S. government agency that supports research and education in science and engineering, awarded 24 USC students with the 2017 Graduate Research Fellowship on March 17.
The NSF Graduate Research Fellowship was founded 65 years ago and has a long history of selecting recipients who go on to achieve success in their future academic and professional careers. Every year, around 13,000 applicants compete for 2,000 of these prestigious fellowships, which provide a $34,000 annual stipend for three years and an additional $12,000 for tuition. 
Currently, 42 fellows have gone on to become Nobel laureates, and more than 450 have become members of the National Academy of Sciences. In addition, according to the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program website, the program has a high rate of doctorate degree completion, with more than 70 percent of students completing their doctorates within 11 years. 
The recipients encompassed both recent alumni and current students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. With 24 recipients and another 12 students earning honorable mentions, this year’s total is USC’s highest ever number of recipients. In 2015, 15 USC students won awards, and the number of recipients rose to 19 students in 2016. The increase is indicative of the USC faculty’s dedication to cultivating the next generation of young scholars. 
The Class of 2017 recipients have backgrounds in a wide variety of fields and disciplines, including psychology, computer science, chemistry, gerontology and neuroscience, among others. Additionally, 19 of the 24 recipients were female, reflecting a concerted effort made by USC to recruit more women and minorities into the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. 
The USC Graduate School, sponsored by funding from the USC Provost, hosted a summer boot camp for applicants to the NSF and other major awards. The 10-day intensive writing workshop supported students through the stringent process and provided guidance from faculty members as well as a stipend of $1,000, so students could focus on their applications.

Goodwin Liu, an Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court gave a lecture at the USC Gould School of Law Thursday. The lecture was attended by students and faculty members and is part of the Neiman-Sieroty Lecture series, an endowed series named after Gould graduates Allen Neiman and Alan Sieroty.
Liu was sworn in as an associate justice in September 2011 and authored six unanimous decisions in his first year. Prior to joining the court, Liu clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, worked for law firm O’Melveny & Myers and taught at UC Berkeley Boalt School of Law. 
Liu’s lecture, “State Courts, State Constitutions and Individual Rights” was inspired by “State Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights,” a Harvard Law Review article by the late Justice William Brennan. 
“Over the years, this article by Justice Brennan has spawned very expansive literature on judicial federalism,” Liu said. 
Liu used the article as a springboard to explain his views on the role of state courts. He believes that state courts shouldn’t feel obligated to adhere strictly to federal precedent in regards to important issues. 
“Many of our basic rights and liberties are protected by similar language in the federal and state constitutions,” Liu said. “State courts and federal courts can and do have principled disagreements on the meaning of those rights and liberties.”
Given the policy changes the Trump administration may implement, students found Liu’s lecture intriguing. Dylan Bonfigli, a third-year law student, finds the dynamic between state and federal courts interesting. 
“I definitely think his lecture is relevant,” Bonfigli said. “One of the main parts [of the lecture] is when the federal government and Supreme Court don’t protect rights in a way the public may want, the state courts can step in to provide greater rights than the federal government.” 
Although he supports states’ rights to make independent decisions, Liu argued against the romanticization of an exclusive state culture that doesn’t take into account what other states are doing. Instead, he advocates for states promoting their interpretations of American values. 
“People say things like, ‘California’s the center of the resistance to the new administration,’” Liu said. “But I don’t think these claims are properly understood as claims about California having a distinctive set of values. Rather, California is arguing for its best version of American values. It is saying the rest of the country should follow it.”
Emily Loynachan, who graduated with a master’s degree from the USC Davis School of Gerontology, said she found the lecture compelling for its emphasis on the relationship between the general public and the states, as well as the relationship between states and the government. 
“I think his reflections on inclusivity and dialogue and community and [in] some cases, re-imagining political protocols and language are really critical, especially today,” Loynachan said.
California – justice, now that’s an oxymoron if I ever heard one.

With just over two weeks remaining until the annual Spring Game at the Coliseum, the football team took to Howard Jones Field Thursday for another spring ball practice. After Thursday’s practice (the Trojans’ eighth of the spring), USC has now passed the midway point of spring football workouts.
The defense put up a strong performance, as it generated several turnovers during both red zone and 7-on-7 drills. 
SETTING THE EDGE
Last season, junior outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu and sophomore outside linebacker Porter Gustin crashed the edges defensively for USC. The pair of edge rushers were a force for the Trojans in 2016, and they are striving to wreak even more havoc on opposing offenses in 2017. 
“I think [Nwosu and I] are looking great,” said Gustin, who led USC with 13 tackles for a loss last season. “We’ve played a lot of games together, and I think we’re getting even more comfortable to start off the spring.”
Gustin, who sat out several practices to open up the spring due to hand surgery, noted that his hand has recovered well. He reported that he is “pleasantly surprised that it is not even aching a little bit.”
Nwosu, who had three sacks in 2016, has adopted a leadership role with the USC defense entering his senior season. 
“I didn’t realize how great of a leader he’d be for us,” head coach Clay Helton said. “You can really feel him coming on as the ‘lead-dog’ for our defense.”
Nwosu displayed an ability to break into the offensive backfield on multiple occasions this spring. Standing at 6-foot-3 and weighing in at nearly 240 pounds, Nwosu provides a dangerous mix of speed and size for offensive tackles as he rushes the edges. 
BEYOND THEIR YEARS
One of the standouts from USC’s team scrimmage this past Saturday was freshman defensive tackle and early enrollee Marlon Tuipulotu. During the scrimmage, Tuipulotu received a healthy dosage of plays with the first-string defense. He delivered by doing a consistent job of congesting the line of scrimmage and shutting up running lanes. 
The first-team reps have kept coming for Tuipulotu over the past week of practice. 
In addition to Tuipulotu, Helton has also been impressed by another early enrollee, freshman lineman Andrew Vorhees. He has made a solid impression so far, practicing at the tackle slot for the Trojans this spring. The coaches will look to try out Vorhees at the guard position as well this spring, according to Helton. 
“I did not anticipate [Tuipulotu and Vorhees] to be so far advanced at this age,” Helton said. “[They] should both be in high school right now. Both kids are doing a good job.”
SCRIMMAGE POSTPONED
The Trojans’ scrimmage, which was scheduled to take place this Saturday, will be delayed until the following weekend on April 8. This is due to the amount of injuries which some of USC’s priority players are currently battling. Helton hopes that giving these players another week will allow them to participate in the scrimmage next Saturday. 
Some players who did not participate in Thursday’s practice due to injury included redshirt junior center Nico Falah, sophomore linebacker Cameron Smith and sophomore running back Ronald Jones II.
The team will hold its next full-pad practice this Saturday at Howard Jones Field. The practice is open to the public and will begin at 10 a.m.

Katie Chin | Daily TrojanSwinging for the top · Redshirt junior Frankie Rios takes a swing at a pitch. Rios and the team take to the road to face Arizona on Friday.
After capturing its first two Pac-12 series of the season against Washington State and Arizona State, USC heads to Tucson this weekend for a three-game showdown with No. 13 Arizona.
“To win two in a row separates your record a bit,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “Now we’ve got to go to Arizona and find a way to hopefully continue the streak and win another one.” 
Like USC, Arizona is also off to a hot start to the season. The team now stands at 17-7 after beginning this year’s campaign with a 10-game winning streak. Hitting has been the Wildcats’ greatest strength so far, as they possess a conference high .332 team batting average. The Wildcats also lead the Pac-12 in runs, RBIs, hits, slugging percentage and walks. 
The key to the Wildcats’ early statistical prowess has been an experienced and deep batting order. Six players are currently batting over .320, with sophomore Alfonso Rivas III leading the way with an eye-popping .395 average. The Wildcats may have lost five starters from last year’s team, but the College World Series runner-ups remain a top national contender. 
While they may lack the same offensive efficiency, USC has also been hitting well to start the season. Sophomore Lars Nootbaar has been the team’s clutch performer so far, with a team-leading four home runs and 21 RBIs. Fellow sophomore Brandon Perez has been a pleasant surprise this year; after seeing limited at-bats last season, he is hitting .338. Senior Corey Dempster is currently on a 11-game hitting streak after solidifying the Trojans’ victory against San Diego State on Wednesday with an eighth inning RBI single. 
“I’m just attacking the fastball and being aggressive,” Dempster said. “I think the biggest thing is not being afraid to let ball speed go early in the count or being afraid to get behind either.”
As opposed to hitting, pitching has been more of an adventure for the Trojans. The young bullpen has had its bright spots — freshman closer Austin Manning has three saves and fellow freshman Chris Clarke has provided key innings when called upon. However, inconsistency has been an issue for regular starters such as sophomore Marrick Crouse and junior Brad Wegman. Overall, USC is eighth in Pac-12 team ERA, which could be problematic against Arizona’s stacked batting order. 
One storyline to watch this weekend will be who Hubbs decides to start behind the plate at the catcher position. Senior transfer Cris Perez and freshmen Kaleb Murphy and Blake Sabol have all seen significant time behind the plate so far this season. As the Trojans head deeper into the heart of conference play, it will be interesting to see if the position becomes more solidified. 
After wrapping up the series against Arizona, USC has a quick detour against Long Beach State on Tuesday before returning to Dedeaux Field for a three-game series with Stanford starting on Thursday. 
“It’s a grind week in and week out, day in day out,” Hubbs said. “The guys just have to be prepared for it.”

If it seems like I’ve written this column before, it’s because I have — twice. When the St. Louis Rams moved to Los Angeles last year, I said it was a bad idea. When the San Diego Chargers also relocated to the City of Angels earlier this year, I said the same.
I’m going to write it a third time — and don’t worry, it’ll be different. It’ll be different because it’s one of my teams.
Earlier this week, the Oakland Raiders received the go-ahead to relocate to Las Vegas as soon as 2019, with all but one of the 32 NFL owners voting for the move.
And I’ll cut right to it: This is a decision based on money, greed and profit. A franchise moving from the blue-collar town of Oakland with not-the-best reputation to the glitz and glamour of Vegas reeks of a cash grab. If you walked into the room of the owners meeting in Phoenix on Monday, you might have smelled the distinct scent of dollar bills wafting through the air.
You know what else you could have sensed? The sound of the jaws of every Raiders fan — including me — dropping to the floor with the realization that their beloved team was deserting them for a city with the actual nickname of “Sin City.”
I don’t have one of those, “My first football game was a Raiders game when I was four years old and my room is decked out in silver and black” kind of stories. Growing up in the Bay Area, I probably have rooted more heavily and been willing to admit my support for the San Francisco 49ers more than the team across the bay. I have a 49ers sweater and beanie, but no Raiders apparel. I’ve been to more games at Candlestick Park and Levi’s Stadium than the Coliseum.
But that doesn’t mean I wasn’t hurt by the news. The Raiders are as integral a part of the Bay Area as Philz Coffee and the word “hella.” They are a recognizable trademark of where I grew up, and now they’re just packing their bags and leaving.
I feel for the fans, the loyal supporters, the season-ticket holders who have endured losing season after losing season for nothing. And boy, those were some dark days.
This is a franchise that — prior to making the playoffs last season — had missed the postseason each of the last 13 years. The highlight before that period was probably being robbed of a playoff win in 2001 by the Patriots and a young Tom Brady — who somehow still has a perfect life and is still frustratingly winning Super Bowls in 2017 — in the infamous Tuck Rule Game. That was my first tangible sports memory, and it was an awful one.
Oh, and they also drafted the biggest bust of all-time in JaMarcus Russell and made one of the worst coaching hires of all-time in Lane Kiffin, who USC fans know very well. The subhead on the Raiders’ Wikipedia page from 2004-2014 literally reads “Coaching carousel and mediocrity.”
And yet, despite the Raiders being bad for the majority of my youth, there was still something about them that garnered my respect, that made me root for them. Perhaps it was that they represented Oakland, a city where shootings and robberies regularly dominate the news cycle. For Oakland, the Raiders are more than just a football team, more than just a sports thing. They bring the community together, to unite and cheer for one common goal, not to mention invaluable assets such as the economic boon on Sundays or the inspiration the team can provide for kids to play sports instead of head to the streets.
But to think owner Mark Davis and his hilarious bowl cut care about any of the above would be naïve. He wanted more money than he could possibly spend, and he got it. He wanted a shiny new stadium in a metropolis, and he got it. And if it came at the expense of uprooting an organization that had been the hallmark of its community for decades on end, so be it.
So I hope he enjoys himself in Las Vegas, a city that committed $750 million of taxpayer money to fund the new stadium to be constructed by 2020. Vegas is in the midst of a water shortage with Lake Mead drying up, but yeah, go ahead and spend close to a billion dollars on a football stadium. Great idea.
I have no problem if the Raiders relocated because they had to, because they weren’t drawing enough fans or unable to support themselves financially. I do have a problem, though, when the franchise has a fiercely loyal fanbase, a true connection to the community and is a major player in the city of Oakland. I have a problem when the city they move to is Las Vegas, which neither deserves nor needs a sports team. I have a problem when 31 of 32 owners wittingly agree to rip away a franchise from its roots just so they can have a little extra cash in their pockets.
In the sports world, loyalty means nothing and money means everything. It happened to St. Louis with the Rams, to San Diego with the Chargers and now to Oakland with the Raiders. 
Even within the Bay Area, the Golden State Warriors — whose arena is next door to the Raiders and also has a faithful East Bay fanbase — will move to San Francisco in 2019, a move also criticized by many as profit-driven. And in 2014, the San Francisco 49ers tore down Candlestick Park and trekked an hour south of The City to play in a stadium in heart of Silicon Valley, a place meant for tech companies and Teslas — not football stadiums and tailgates.
It is the clear favoritism of large markets over smaller ones, a middle finger to fans and greedy decisions based on profits over what is right for the community that teams have such a large impact on.
The awkward thing is, the Raiders will play at least two more seasons in Oakland before their stadium is ready in Las Vegas, which is like divorcing your wife but still living with her for two more years.

Wow… You are very ill-informed on the topic. Please look into articles and information detailing why the Raiders’ move is the culmination of two decades of bad-faith dealings and treatment by the city of Oakland. Or if you need, I’ll provide you with a proper basic breakdown of what you’ve failed to journalistically explore here. For someone who styles himself a Raiders fan you are shockingly unaware of their actual history and motives in these matters. Also, Vegas is a smaller market than the Bay Area. 
If you’d offered me Raiders mediocrity from 2004-2014 I would have snapped your hand off… woefullness would be nearer the truth…

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
On Tuesday, the Hechinger Report published a report looking at what actions different U.S. colleges are taking to support undocumented students. Some of these actions included establishing emergency legal funds, and, of course, declaring themselves sanctuary campuses. In the weeks following the election of President Donald Trump, who ran his presidential campaign relying on the promise of the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, numerous colleges declared themselves sanctuary campuses as a promise to protect the rights of these students. In November, the Undergraduate Student Government voted for USC to declare itself one, too.
However, the USC administration, while ensuring that the details and circumstances of its students are kept private from the federal government, has declined to declare the University a sanctuary campus. If USC is unwilling to come forward as a sanctuary campus out of fear of government retaliation or the loss of financial support from its board of trustees, there are other necessary steps it must take to dispel fear among undocumented students, and provide them with the resources and support to ensure these students’ ability to safely pursue education at USC. Establishing a resource center for USC’s undocumented community is a crucial step toward achieving this goal.
The University of Utah, Georgetown University, Harvard University, Western Washington University, San Diego State University, San Francisco State University and the California Polytechnic at San Luis Obispo and Pomona have all established resource centers dedicated to providing undocumented students with resources, such as advisement regarding their options and legal rights, support and solidarity. 
Even if USC’s administration is opposed to assuming the label of a “sanctuary campus,” it has an obligation to provide students of all backgrounds and circumstances equal access to a safe, quality education. Despite the administration’s promise to retain the privacy of its undocumented students, as well as numerous memos by Provost Michael Quick and President C.L. Max Nikias offering strong verbal support to foreign and undocumented students, it is no secret that undocumented students across the nation continue to live in fear. 
In fact, according to state officials, applications for California Dream Act financial aid at California’s community college system are down more than 40 percent from last year, largely because students fear identifying as undocumented in case they put themselves and their families at risk of deportation.
These numbers suggest that the institutionalized intimidation of undocumented immigrants is disproportionately harmful to students, and could contribute to less socioeconomically diverse college campuses — to the detriment of all students. Additionally, policies and rhetoric that threaten undocumented students promote cycles of poverty in communities of undocumented immigrants by discouraging higher education or plainly rendering it impossible. 
As the latest numbers released by state officials demonstrate, anxiety among undocumented students who fear deportation from a vehemently anti-immigration government has resulted in many being deterred from achieving higher education. This fact highlights the need for institutions like USC to ensure that students are educated about their rights. Establishing a resource center  would readily provide students with legal counseling, help with financial aid forms and provides a safe, positive space during their undergraduate years. 
Such an investment would ensure that undocumented students, having overcome major challenges to attend such a prestigious institution as USC, are granted the same educational opportunities as their peers.
USC’s commitment to ensuring undocumented students’ legal statuses are a matter of confidentiality is an important step toward protecting their rights and guaranteeing their ability to receive a Trojan education. However, we cannot ignore that this presidential administration has instilled so much fear among undocumented students and has attacked their rights to exist in this country — let alone receive an education. 
Declaring the University as a sanctuary campus would be a crucial step toward ensuring an environment of safety and tolerance. But whether or not USC is a sanctuary campus in name, it has an obligation to  provide the resources of one if it truly seeks to protect the diversity and environment of inclusivity that makes USC the elite institution of higher learning that it is.
Daily Trojan Spring 2017 Editorial Board
When USC declares itself a sanctuary campus is the day this alumnus stops making donations.
I have been a USC fan for 50 years but ever since I started reading the Daily Trojan it’s getting harder and harder to root for a school that is so far left that it’s in danger of falling off the earth.
Where is the outrage over this?  It’s inconceivable that we would provide resources for anyone who is not here legally.  I can’t think of any other area in our lives where we provide so much support for people who are defying the law… particularly people who have no remorse or humility about not being right with the law.  For some reason Democrats and other liberals are not only alright looking the other way, but they actively seek to help them.  It’s wrong, and it’s illegal.  Knowingly harbouring illegal immigrants is a crime.  Working in the United States as an illegal immigrant is also a crime.  Where does this perverse and unhealthy obsession with encouraging, protecting and aiding illegal immigrants come from!?  Why do liberals insist on creating two classes of citizens…and why is USC creating two classes of students?
By the way, NEWSFLASH:  If you are Latino or Hispanic in this country, and you feel people are racist or discriminatory toward you… THIS IS EXACTLY WHY.  Think about it.
They should also have a shoplifters student resource center	. How about a armed robber student resource center ?
It’s only fair.
You guys are pursuing a very disastrous agenda by trying to declare USC a sanctuary campus.  That’s breaking the law and harboring illegals.  It’s been wrong for decades and n is still wrong. Cities that have declared themselves a sanctuary cities will lose some amount of federal funding. Same with states and now these campuses? This is an insane ideology and will on L y serve to do more harm to the citizen students on campus. The university will lose slim I donations, scholarships will get pulled and you will hurt students who are citizens or here on legal visa paperwork.  
This is insanity at work.

The political reports of late have often brought news that, at best, can be reduced to a heavy sigh — and at worst, a minor heart attack. However, for Democrats, independents, moderate Republicans and other generally sane individuals everywhere, March 24 was a glorious day: Moments before it was about to hit the (killing) floor, House Speaker Paul Ryan and President Donald Trump pulled their “repeal and replace” plan, known as the American Health Care Act, off the docket and into the trash bin. 
It was the first Democratic victory in months; it was also a cornerstone in history, most significant for none other than former President Barack Obama. More than a predictable failure of the GOP (despite long-sought, hard-fought — or perhaps, hard-gerrymandered— majorities in both houses of Congress), the inability of the Art of the Deal author to sell Republican health care to Republicans may represent the cementation of Obama’s legacy in the annals of post-Cold War politics.
The failure of the bill was entirely predictable. Obama and his aides, experts, legislators and consultants spent a full 13 months working through the ins and outs of the Affordable Care Act to create a piece of legislation that was moderate, appropriate and workable. The Affordable Care Act was written, researched and peer-reviewed the way health care reform legislation should be — and even then, it was imperfect legislation. (Don’t get me wrong — it was also the imperfect legislation that gave millions of Americans the health care they had never been able to afford, lowered premiums for millions more and expanded coverage to those with disabilities, preexisting conditions and outlying needs.) 
Trumpcare, if you will, was a rushed hodgepodge thrown together in a matter of weeks. Ryan, its author, was supposed to be the GOP’s leading policy professor. The legislation was not only, as Trump would say, “sad,” — but according to Ryan’s own conservative peers, the bill was also “a policy, process, and political disaster” as stated by Michael Needham, head of the ultra-conservative Heritage Action. In short, Ryan revealed his fearsome policy chops to be nothing but a paper tiger. 
Second, this predictable failure is a crushing wound for a party that recently self-identified as having been an “opposition” party for the last eight years. A cornerstone of that opposition was always the hearty promise to repeal the ACA. Even with eight years to dream up a workable alternative, the GOP dawdled and ended up with a half-baked plan that would have left 24 million taxpaying Americans uninsured and millions more with crippled and inadequate health care.
Of course, Trump and his party immediately turned around and blamed it on the Democrats. But congressional Republicans never even got around to reaching across the aisle. They couldn’t even whip their own votes — a sad reality for the party famous for its lock-step loyalty. One Alabama congressman called it “more bad policy than any bill I have ever faced.” Of course, screaming mad constituents breaking down the doors at town halls to preserve their health care doesn’t exactly inspire a “yes” vote from any reasonable congressman. Factionalism was certainly a factor. Ryan later seemed to haphazardly blame the Freedom Caucus. But what does it say about your policy when even people who don’t understand the concept of taxes think your bill is ridiculous? 
Third, and my most favorite part: the astonishingly bipartisan, modest, pouty aftermath. Chief of Staff Reince Priebus decided it was time to reach across the aisle to moderate Democrats; Ryan himself said that Americans would be “living with Obamacare for the forseeable future.” Trump decided healthcare was now the Democrats’ responsibility.
In summary: With both houses of Congress and the White House, with eight years as the “opposition party” (cue the laughter, again), with the reins in the hands of policy guru Ryan and with time, tide and approval on their side, the GOP could not dismantle the ACA. Even their attempt to do so came with a “replace” addendum. Luckily, this suggests national health care as a social notion and as a policy is here to stay. It means that Obama’s greatest legacy — Obama’s cornerstone of American health care and progressive social legislation — will in all likelihood remain on the books to serve millions of Americans for years to come. 
Ryan and Trump’s preparation and strategy were terrible, and their inability to support their own legislation casts major shadows on Ryan’s policy mojo and Trump’s dealmaking magic. Once Republicans — from simple voters to senators — realized the extent of the ACA — its widespread positive impact, its integrality to the framework of American health care and its necessity for the maintenance of an industrialized and advanced society — good old “Obamacare” suddenly became a lot harder to destroy. So kitesurf your heart out, our dearly-missed former president; your legacy remains intact — hopefully, for years to come.

My housemate Amanda came home from her first date with Austin, a physician’s assistant she met on Tinder, with a crazy story to tell. He’d been weird the whole night, she said. Dinner was awkward. He was goofy — and not in the way she was looking for. He would chuckle like a cartoon character. 
But Amanda continued to give the date a shot and went up to Griffith Observatory with him. Soon, the magic bloomed as they swirled into the sky under the planetarium dome. Just kidding. He stood next to her in line at the telescope awkwardly half-turned away from her. They didn’t even brush arms. The conversation lulled. Austin drove her home.
That’s when the craziest thing happened. Austin gave Amanda the best kiss of her life. Soon, she and Austin were seeing each other once a week. They had fantastic sex. He cooked her dinner. Amanda blushed as she told me, “I really like him.”
It’s everything I wanted for my friend. She told me about their conversations and how she no longer felt the weird energy he put off on their first date. “I think he was just nervous,” she said, giggling to me about it as we sat on her bed. 
\Amanda is about to graduate, and because she’s at such a transitional point in her life, she doesn’t know if she wants to pursue a relationship. But she wanted to see where things went with Austin, who treated her kindly and made her laugh.
This is the first time I’ve written about a friend for this column. Unfortunately, I’m not writing this as a case study of what it’s like to fall in love, nor is this going to be a Tinder nightmare that I want to regale you with.
Amanda’s story is gruesomely typical. It’s completely honest. It happened to her this weekend, and I felt it as it unfolded because it’s something I feel has happened to me countless times.
Austin disappeared after he cooked Amanda dinner. Whatever they had ended over text the following Saturday. His work hours were crazy, he said. He left it at that. What I think often gets missed is that although this isn’t technically ghosting, a half-excuse shouldn’t get someone off the hook. We want and deserve answers. 
Amanda, like a lot of girls I know, is smart enough to understand what a vague text means. But Amanda, like a lot of other girls I know, would also be strong enough to handle it if a boy had just said to her that he didn’t want to see her any more. It’s as if men think they’re breaking our hearts after three dates if they explicitly state that they don’t want to see us anymore. Instead, they’re hurting amazing women like Amanda by letting things slide away.
Luckily, Amanda wouldn’t let things slide. So she reached out to Austin. After a short conversation, she said this: “If you’d like to see me again, tell me. If you don’t, tell me.” Also — props to Amanda — she admitted that he’d hurt her. There’s no reason not to tell someone they behaved badly if it affected you. Unfortunately, however, Austin only read what he wanted to read.
It’s as if this gangly Hollywood physician’s assistant with the cartoon laugh read the word “hurt” and automatically assumed she was in love with him. His response was a paragraph explaining how he didn’t want to be in a relationship (although Amanda had mentioned this nowhere in her text). Austin used work as an excuse again, and then said “I’m sorry if you felt differently about this.” A well-crafted apology generally doesn’t lay the blame on the other party.
Amanda didn’t, but a lot of my friends end text conversations like these with “next time” as if to teach the boys they’re seeing some dating etiquette, or inside tips on how not to hurt a girl’s feelings. In this column, I’d like to have a different approach. I’d like to provide some tips for “this time” for those who wish to date casually, particularly online.
First, do not disappear on someone who you’ve spent more than one date with. Casual does not mean disposable. When you meet someone on Tinder, they do not stay in Internet limbo forever. If you stop texting her, she will not disappear.
Second, you know what they say about assumptions. You do not know what someone is looking for in a relationship unless you have an open conversation about it. This is preferably done in person.
Third, give honest answers. You — I hope — would do this in almost any other aspect of your life. No matter how casual the sex is, or how many or few people you are seeing, each individual deserves at least that much of your energy.

With a chic rustic beach vibe, the small restaurant immediately draws in the audience’s eye: Bäcoshop is aesthetically pleasing in its architecture, interior design and food. However, despite such elements, the restaurant’s food leaves much to ask for.
Bäcoshop is located in Culver City, on Washington Boulevard and Irving Place. According to the owner and chef, Josef Centeno, in a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Bäcoshop is a take-away from Bäco Mercat — his restaurant in downtown Los Angeles — with new variants of the bäco flatbread, Centeno’s signature item.
 A group of workers quickly greets the newly arriving guests in the restaurant. The workers are friendly and eager to help, even with the lack of customers. Bäcoshop is styled in the design of the trendy “fast-food, sit-down” restaurants — no server will come to the table to take guest orders. Rather, customers must order at the counter when they arrive. Despite this factor in service, the food is prepared quickly — the second positive element alongside its chic interior design.
 Bäcoshop follows the trend of emerging restaurants that have amazing presentation with
health-conscious ingredients. But its substance ends there. 
The shop has wide-paneled windows, painted with a bright red that reflects the California sunshine, as small plants and printed lanterns dangle against the crisp white walls. Its countertop is contrasted with navy blue and white tiles, while white chairs outline its clean wooden tabletops. Beauty is only skin deep, and in the case of Bäcoshop, its wow factor is strictly through its impressive aesthetic.
For the grilled steak bäco, the food is initially separated for the customer to mix together. The grilled steak, pickled onions, lettuce, quinoa, almonds and cheese are just a few of the ingredients within it.
However, with the first bite, the textures do not mix well with one’s palate, and the distinct ingredients are incongruent. Although these ingredients are fresh, their individual combined flavors fall flat. The balance of spicy, savory and sweet do not cross and fall into an expected flavor blast; rather, they run parallel.
Another dish on the Bäcoshop menu is the chile shrimp bäcorrito, which is the restaurant’s version of a burrito. The shrimp, while fresh, is the only redeeming quality. The wrap is soggy and the large amount of radishes within the bäcorrito is overwhelming, causing an overpowering taste that masked everything else within the dish, even the shrimp. The shell is also rubbery and hard to chew.
 Bäcoshop’s menu ranged further, including vegetarian options and desserts, but it can most likely be assumed that the overall experience is equally unimpressive. For its price, the food left much to be wanted. The average bäco and bäcorito costs around $10 and when factoring in taste and location, it appears overpriced in comparison to other restaurants.

Throughout history, there have been various couples in the music industry who have captured the public eye — John Lennon and Yoko Ono immediately come to mind, and which fan of Kurt Cobain has not heard of Courtney Love?
Most casual music fans today, however, would not know of Lee and Helen Morgan, the couple whose tragic story stunned the jazz world back in the 1970s. I Called Him Morgan, a documentary by Swedish director Kasper Collin, explores the couple’s dynamic.
 Morgan recounts the doomed relationship between jazz musician Lee and Helen Morgan, his manager and common-law wife. Featuring the cinematography of Arrival’s Bradford Young, the documentary depicts how the career of a brilliant trumpet prodigy was tragically cut short.
 Surprisingly, it is not Lee Morgan but rather, Helen Morgan who proves to be the most intriguing element of the documentary. The heart of Morgan revolves around the poignant testimony of Lee Morgan’s widow, who passed away a month after the interview. A strong-willed woman from impoverished roots, Helen Morgan exhibits a candor that forms the film’s emotional crux. Her narrative incites reactions ranging from sympathy to repulsion, reflecting her complex and captivating character.
Unfortunately, the intrigue of Helen Morgan’s character makes Lee Morgan uninteresting in comparison. For all its recitation of Lee Morgan’s talent, the documentary fails to humanize the musician; there is little background given on his life before his success. 
Furthermore, beyond Lee Morgan’s cockiness and addiction, the other facets of his personality go relatively unexplored. Ironically, when Morgan focuses on its titular character, the film’s quality slides into that of a standard biographical documentary and the narrative loses its emotional resonance.
The stronghold of the film, the relationship between Lee Morgan and Helen Morgan, is often pushed aside in favor of extraneous details on Lee Morgan’s career — he and Helen Morgan do not even meet until a third of the way into the film. Much of Morgan’s introduction is also heavily saturated in jazz culture, which alienates viewers who are less acquainted with the genre’s history.
 Regardless of the deficiencies in storytelling, however, the story is fascinating and informative. Lee Morgan and Helen Morgan’s heartbreaking story is fraught with drama, and the expertly executed climax puts viewers on the edges of their seats in anticipation. Besides Helen Morgan’s testimony, Morgan is resplendent with more in-depth interviews with figures of pivotal importance in the story, and the various perspectives that the film discloses are fascinating. 
 Through the uses of both digital video and film, Young gives Morgan a retro look in a visual homage to Morgan’s time. Coupled with the documentary’s excellent jazz soundtrack, the cinematography gives Morgan a distinct feel that belies the stereotypical detached and objective tone of the documentary.
 Overall, Morgan is a mixed bag that constantly skates the line between dull and enthralling. Despite the film’s padding and standard portrait of Morgan himself, Collin recounts a fascinating story that rocked the jazz world, told from the perspective of a conflicted and enthralling woman. The film arrives in L.A
theaters on March 31.

In a crucial match, No. 11 USC was defeated by its crosstown rival, No. 6 UCLA, in three sets: 25-18, 25-19 and 25-17. While UCLA clinched a berth in the MPSF tournament, the Trojans’ road to the tournament becomes much harder with the loss.
The Trojans had their season-best five-match win streak snapped while falling to 11-13 overall and 5-10 in the MPSF. UCLA improved to 16-7 overall and 9-6 in the MPSF while winning its sixth straight match.
After missing six games due to an abdominal strain, senior outside hitter Lucas Yoder returned with eight kills for the Trojans. Senior Andy Benesh had five blocks while sophomore Matt Douglas contributed seven digs.
For the Bruins, Mitch Stahl led the way with nine blocks while Hagen Smith had nine digs and three aces.
The Trojans struggled throughout the match, hitting just .088 compared to UCLA’s .373. Additionally, the Bruins edged the Trojans in blocks (10.5 to 6.0) and aces (8 to 0).
The Trojans started off the first set nicely, up 4-3, but that lead quickly became a 10-5 deficit. Although they recovered with a nice dig by Douglas midway through the set, it was too little, too late. The Bruins took the first set 25-18.
In the second set, the Trojans kept pace early. At one point the two teams were tied at 8 apiece, but the Bruins went on to win 3 of the next 4 points to burst out in front, 12-9. Later on, a nice spike from sophomore Connor Inlow kept USC in the set at 16-13. After that, however, UCLA went on a 5-1 run to jump ahead 21-14. The Bruins took the second set 25-19.
The Trojans went into desperation mode in the third set, while the Bruins appeared to be at the top of their game. Like in the first set, USC started off well, up 3-2 early on. But before the Trojans could blink their eyes, they fell behind 6-10. Later, trailing by 13-9, Benesh and freshman Lucas Lossone put up some clutch blocks to pull the Trojans within striking distance. Yoder continued to keep the Trojans alive with some nice kills, but on match point, down 17-24, a UCLA spike deflected off a Trojan and into the crowd. The Bruins swept the Trojans, 3-0.
USC now faces an uphill battle as it hopes to make the MPSF conference tournament. However, two out of the team’s final three matches are at home. They finish with UC Santa Barbara and Cal-Baptist at the Galen Center and Cal-Baptist on the road. The Trojans have played well at home this year, going 6-4 after the loss to UCLA tonight. If they can win two more games at home down the stretch, their chances at the conference tournament should be solid.
The Trojans will take on UCSB at the Galen Center on Friday at 7 p.m.
Probably the worst match I have seen live at the Galen Ctr since it opened. There was no fire from the players,
and the Coach was so stoic even during time outs. Pathetic is the right word in this case. The team played better
at ucla earlier in the season. The team is way too small with the outside hitters. Bad hire by Pat Haden taking the asst.

When I was assigned the baseball beat last spring for the Daily Trojan, I couldn’t have been more excited. The program was coming off its most encouraging season in years, making the 2015 NCAA Regional Final and losing to the eventual champion, Virginia. Jeremy Martinez, one of the premier hitters in college baseball, would be back at USC for his junior season along with senior ace Kyle Davis and a host of other talented ballplayers, and USC looked set to make a serious run at the College World Series.
But the Trojans stumbled just a little out of the gates, and they never recovered. When I flew home for the summer, the team was two games under .500, finishing the season at an even 28-28 — with a school-record 12 MLB Draft picks on the roster.
I was disappointed, but it wasn’t a huge deal personally: I had enjoyed my weekends and Tuesday nights at the ballpark regardless. Having said that, I just couldn’t be optimistic about the 2017 season when I assigned baseball beat writers in January as one of the new sports editors. Surely, a green USC team would struggle this spring, if only because of the ridiculous amount of roster turnover. I grimly thought about head coach Dan Hubbs, who I enjoyed talking to throughout the 2016 campaign. I wondered if I would see him in the Dedeaux Field dugout come my senior spring semester?
But here we are near the end of March, and Hubbs and his Trojans are sitting pretty at 15-8 overall (they were 11-12 at this point last season) and in third place in the Pac-12. They have taken two of three in their first two conference series of the year, and they shut out a high-powered San Diego State offense for the second time this season on Tuesday night. Dedeaux Field has also been a fortress early on, with USC boasting an 11-5 mark at home.
How did the Trojans manage this after losing two-thirds of their regular 2016 starting lineup and close to half of their entire roster of pitchers? After Hubbs endured much criticism last year, credit must go the head coach now, as he has rallied a USC squad that was picked to finish second-to-bottom in the conference in the preseason.
The return of outfielder Corey Dempster was a massive boost as well: The senior passed up a chance to sign with the New York Yankees last summer to return to USC, and he has been a menace hitting cleanup so far this spring, mashing .325 with two home runs and 12 runs batted in. Junior infielder Adalberto Carrillo has also chipped in three home runs and 17 RBIs in his third year in Cardinal and Gold.
The star of the season so far, however, is undoubtedly sophomore Lars Nootbaar, who has shifted over to first base after playing outfield during his freshman campaign.
Nootbaar cooled off dramatically after a hot start last year, but he has showed no signs of slowing down in 2017, leading the team with a .338 batting average, four dingers and 21 RBIs. He went 3-for-4 on Tuesday and also drove in two crucial runs with a double in the series finale against Arizona State last weekend.
But USC’s team batting average has actually fallen considerably compared to 2016, from .294 down to .268. Though they have come up with clutch hits when needed, the Trojans’ hitting has been more timely than consistently deadly so far this year.
The squad’s biggest boost this year has come from its pitching. USC endured many disappointing performances on the mound in 2016, finishing the season with a team earned run average of 4.51, which ranked 131st in the nation. The staff has shaved nearly a half-run off that figure this spring. Six Trojan pitchers own ERAs under three, and this wealth of reliable arms may very well be the team’s X factor so far, as USC has taken 11 of its 15 victories this year by fewer than five runs.
And the most exciting part about this team is its age. Dempster and infielder David Edson are due to graduate at the end of the season, but most key players should return next spring, assuming last year’s record number of draftees was an anomaly and not the start of a trend. If the Trojans can play to this level with a relatively inexperienced roster, what can they do with a seasoned group of veterans?
Of course, USC’s youth also puts it at a disadvantage this year. It’s early: The college baseball season has more than 50 games, and who knows if Hubbs’ many freshman bats and arms will be able to power through the stretch run.
Nevertheless, it has been exciting to watch freshman outfielders Brady Shockey and Matthew Acosta deliver clutch hits, and redshirt sophomore Bryce Dyrda and freshman Austin Manning are developing into shutdown closing options in the bullpen. Freshman Chris Clarke even pitched his way out of the bullpen and into the starting rotation after earning the win with 5.2 innings of shutout relief against UCLA at the Dodger Stadium Classic.
With a collegiate baseball program as historic as USC’s, it’s always great to have a nationally relevant team on campus — the Trojans are the alma mater of Tom Seaver, Mark McGwire and and Randy Johnson, after all. It seemed like the Trojans were back on the road to a championship before last season’s stumble. Perhaps this year’s underdog side is about to get things on track again, no matter what the experts may predict.

The Trojans will face two Pac-12 teams this weekend, heading to Washington to take on Washington State on Friday and Washington on Sunday. The weekend in Washington will be a building time for the team after taking a small step upwards in the Oracle/ITA rankings over the weekend.
This weekend, the Trojans will start off against a program that remains winless in Pac-12 conference play. Washington State is 9-8 overall on their season, but sits at 0-3 in the conference. The Cougars have struggled throughout March, losing five meets in a row and taking difficult 4-3 losses on the road at Colorado and Utah. The team also does not boast any nationally ranked singles players or doubles teams.
Washington has fared better on the season, retaining a No. 35 ranking nationally with a 13-4 overall record. The Huskies are 4-6 in Pac-12 conference play after a dominant weekend of road victories, taking down Utah 4-0 and Colorado 5-2. Two Washington singles players sit in the bottom tier of national rankings, with Miki Kobayashi at No. 111 and Stacey Fung at No. 118. The pairing of Kobayashi and Nour Abbes is ranked No. 39 nationally.
The Trojans held onto their national rankings over the weekend, with several teams breaking into the top tier of national play. The most recent national rankings were released on Tuesday, moving the Trojans up one slot to the No. 39 national ranking. The move came after USC beat out Loyola Marymount in a 4-3 victory last week. Three of the top 25 teams in the rankings are Pac-12 teams, led by No. 8 Stanford and No. 14 California.
Three Trojans also remain in the top national rankings for singles after rankings for both singles and doubles were released last week. Junior Gabby Smith moved up five places in the overall rankings, earning a spot at No. 20. The week saw drops in rankings for both sophomore Jessica Failla and senior Zoë Katz, with Failla falling to No. 47 and Katz falling to No. 96.
Meanwhile, four Trojan duos remain in the top 50 teams in the nation for doubles.
Failla and sophomore Rianna Valdes took a major leap in rankings as they moved up from No. 75 to No. 33, while Valdes and Westby found their way into the rankings for the first time to tie for No. 74. Katz and Smith dropped to No. 34, while Kulikove and Westby also fell three slots, taking No. 67.
This weekend will allow the Trojans to defend their national rankings and to continue to cement their place in the conference early in Pac-12 play.

Swimming scholars · Ten members of the women’s swim and dive team were selected this week for the Pac-12 All-Academic teams – Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
A total of 10 Trojans earned Pac-12 All-Academic Honors this week for their performance in the pool and in the classroom. Senior Anika Apostalon, who was also selected as the Pac-12 Scholar-Athlete of the Year, earned a spot in the conference All-Academic first team.
Sophomore Elizabeth Stinson was also picked for a spot on the All-Academic second team. The pair was joined by eight other women’s swimmers and divers who made the list of athletes honored by the Pac-12.
Apostalon is the co-captain for the team and also earned three All-American distinctions in the pool this year. She was already awarded Scholar-Athlete of the Year honors at this year’s Pac-12 championship after earning a 3.92 GPA in psychology. Stinson was a member of last year’s NCAA team and a 2016 Pac-12 champion. She earned her spot on the second team after finishing with a 3.62 GPA in economics.
Seniors Riley Hayward and Kelsey Kafka earned honorable mentions, along with junior Hannah Weiss and sophomores Hanni Leach, Olivia Ontjes, Riley Scott, Allie Wooden and Maddie Wright. This was Kafka’s third year receiving the honor and Weiss’ second.
Student-athletes must earn a minimum GPA of 3.0 and take part in at least half of their athletic team’s events throughout the regular season in order to be eligible for the Pac-12 academic team.
The list excludes freshmen and first-year transfers, allowing only members from sophomore through senior classes. The Trojans were third in teams on the list, trailing Cal and Stanford.
This years’ accolades came after the Trojans took ninth overall at the NCAA championship and third at the Pac-12 championships.

The Pac-12 named junior Deanna Hill the conference Track and Field Women’s Track Athlete of the Week for the week of March 20 through 26.
Hill clinched the accolade after placing second in the 100-meter dash at the Aztec Invitational last week. At the event, she notched a personal record of 11.18 seconds. Her time ranks second in the country so far this season. It also moves Hill ahead from ninth place to seventh place overall on the list of records for the Trojans’ 100-meter dash.
At the invitational, Hill also anchored her team’s winning 4×100-meter relay. The team posted a time of 43.97 seconds, a time that currently ranks third overall in the country.
This is Hill’s second Track Athlete of the Week honor from the conference after she received the same award in 2015. So far this season, she is the team’s second athlete to receive the award, joining Nick Ponzio, who received last week’s honor.
Next up, Hill will travel with the men’s and women’s teams’ sprinters and jumpers to the Texas Relays in Austin. The teams’ throwers and distance runners will split off to travel to San Diego for a one-day competition at the California Collegiate.
The Trojans currently boast 22 individual times that rank in the top 25 of the country. Additionally, all four of the USC relay teams rank in the country’s top 25. This weekend, the team looks to defend the men’s No. 11 ranking and the women’s No. 5 ranking.

A new project from the USC Rossier School of Education is helping to influence higher education policy by collecting student profiles from marginalized groups.
Zoë Corwin, an associate research professor at Rossier, initiated My Higher Ed Story through the Pullias Center for Higher Education. She said that one of the main goals is to provide people with information about how higher education policy affects students personally.
“I thought that it was really important for people who are making policy and people who are reading the newspaper and people who vote to get to know some of the students that can either be helped or hurt by new legislation and current legislation,” Corwin said. “A lot of times, if you yourself are not a first-generation student and you haven’t had that experience, it’s maybe hard to know what other students have gone through.”
Corwin said that she conceived of the project, in part, because of the current presidential administration.
“After the recent presidential election, we put out a series of policy and informational pieces to encourage the new administration to think about the work that we do here,” Corwin said. “Dr. Tierney, who co-directs the Pullias Center, led the way and we put out a piece for the new Secretary of Education about Higher Ed [and] the head of the higher education task force. We had all these pieces going out just to say we know a little bit about how to support students who have been historically marginalized.”
According to Corwin, part of the work the Pullias Center does is research how to increase college access.
“How do schools, school districts, the government, [and] access providers help students who are first in their families to go to college, low income, etc.,” Corwin said. “So that’s the research we’ve been doing for a very long time.”
Corwin added that one thing they found post-election was that many students were fearful about their futures.
“I was actually teaching a master’s level course, and I had students coming to me who were scared and fearful about the future,” Corwin said. “We work in a lot of high schools in the area where kids were not going to school, they were scared of what was going to happen with their families. That’s due to immigration status; it’s due to students from religious minorities, and some LGBTQ students are concerned because there’s a lot of uncertainty.”
Corwin said that as a qualitative researcher, she believes in the power of storytelling, which was a driving factor in the launch of My Higher Ed Story project.
“We were really reaching out to people from a historically underrepresented group,” Corwin said. “Everyone found a couple of people to tell their story and we asked them: What has been a pivotal moment in your higher ed journey? Where has higher education let you down? What do you think policy makers and practitioners need to know about higher ed and financial aid?”
Corwin said that this project is timely given the current political climate.
“With a lot of the rhetoric that’s going on right now, people can feel less than or scared to wear a hijab or scared to be out,” Corwin said. “I think that they felt it was rather empowering to be able to share their stories and hopefully make an impact beyond their circle. It’s nice because the participants are not just from USC, they’re from institutions across the country. So we’ve been hearing back from all different institutions to say how much people are appreciating hearing the stories.”
Corwin said that the premise of the project is knowing that people’s stories can be transformational.
“So often we harbor resentment or stereotypes or just misinformation about different groups of people, and it’s really hard to find the spaces to interact,” Corwin said. “I think this was an effort to spread stories out, and my hope is that if people get to know stories then we’ll slowly be able to break down different biases.”
Antar Tichavakunda, a Ph.D. student in the Rossier School of Education and a curator of the project, wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan that he was particularly touched by the sheer volume of people who were ready and willing to share their stories.
“It’s difficult to remain unchanged after reading these narratives,” Tichavakunda wrote. “[The goal of the project is] to remind folks of the humanity of people who maybe look differently from us that would not come in contact with otherwise.”
Erica Kirk, a graduate student and contributor to My Higher Ed Story, wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan that the project is important because it gives a voice to students who are not typically heard.
“For me personally, it’s nice to know that there are people who look at diversity beyond simple numbers,” Kirk wrote. “Students from underrepresented and marginalized backgrounds have stories and histories that shape their educational experience.”
Kirk chose to share the story because transgender and gender-nonconforming students often have few role models that have succeeded in higher education.
“I am a graduate student who has dealt with harassment and discrimination but I have persisted and will graduate this May,” Kirk wrote. “It would have meant the world for me to see that as an undergrad, so I know the importance of sharing our struggles and our successes.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated Erica Kirk’s preferred pronoun. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
