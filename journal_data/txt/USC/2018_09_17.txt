After sputtering to a 37-14 loss in Austin and dropping out of the Top 25 rankings, the Trojans regrouped at Howard Jones Field on Monday to start a damage control effort. With a 1-2 record weighing heavily on the practice, head coach Clay Helton’s demeanor was different as he marshalled practice.
Helton spent the whole day with the offense, stalking between his players, barking orders that echoed across the field. He dropped at least eight “f-bombs” in his post-practice huddle. He grinned wryly as sophomore left tackle Austin Jackson tangled with a scout-team linebacker, tossing a punch and shouting until he was dragged away by two teammates.
“I like it,” he shouted as the two players broke apart, already laughing, and the team roared with cheers as they lined up for the final snaps of practice. 
For senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware, the change was much-needed. After the Texas loss, Ware complained that the last two weeks of practice had been too relaxed, but Monday was more his speed. He complimented Helton for getting in players’ faces and pushing them harder than normal, saying that he saw the energy affect the entire team.
“It seemed like everybody came with a chip on their shoulder,” Ware said. “I’m satisfied with today.”
A main focus of the day for Helton was the running back unit, which rushed for negative yards against Texas. This was the first time the Trojans recorded negative rushing yards in a game since 1999. 
Offensive coordinator Tee Martin said that it was hard to pinpoint the source of the rushing problems — in the opening two games of the season, the passing game was the weak point of the attack, with freshman quarterback JT Daniels throwing only one of the team’s five touchdowns this season. 
In hopes of kick starting the rushing game again, Helton tailored 80 percent of practice to focus on running drills. Despite the struggles that the team had with these plays over the weekend, the team reacted well to the emphasis on Monday.
“The biggest challenge is two back-to-back road games; two physical, emotional games, I was really looking forward to seeing how they were today,” Helton said. “I thought they came out here and competed their butts out. I think they played extremely well.” 
Helton’s other main focus is keeping his team focused on the future rather than the past. Despite the letdown of the Texas loss, the Trojans have only five days to transition before facing Washington State at home on Friday night. The last time the two teams met on a Friday was last season, when the Cougars pulled off an upset.
This year, Washington State will bring a speedy defense paired with a stalwart pass-heavy offense, helmed by quarterback Gardner Minshew II, who has already thrown for 1,203 yards and eight touchdowns this season. For the Trojan defense — which is struggling with injuries and suspensions at the safety position — this pass-heavy offense will force the defensive line to step up to create pocket pressure. 
Injury report
Helton confirmed on Sunday that sophomore kicker Chase McGrath is out for the season with a torn ACL. He will undergo surgery within the next two weeks. Safety Isaiah Pola-Mao is also out for the season after suffering a dislocated shoulder in the Texas game. His surgery will take place on Thursday, and he will face six months of recovery afterwards.
Sophomore right guard Andrew Vorhees returned to full activity in practice after straining his knee during the Texas game.
Helton could not provide a status on sophomore safety Bubba Bolden, who has been benched for the entirety of the season for undisclosed reasons.

Sunday’s announcement that starting kicker Chase McGrath would not suit up again for the Trojans in 2018 after tearing his ACL was only the latest tragedy in a truly disastrous weekend for USC football. Frankly, it was also just the latest bad news to come to a special teams unit that put up one of the worst performances by a major college football team in recent memory.
The Trojans, as they have done since the start of the season, trotted out two punters who both failed to find success in pinning the Longhorns back. Redshirt senior Chris Tilbey had a 13-yard punt that set up Texas around midfield before they kicked an ultimately decisive go-ahead field goal to end the first half. Tilbey would again go on to hit a 22-yard punt that led to the game’s final score, a Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger 4-yard touchdown run.
Redshirt senior Reid Budrovich was more successful, but his 29-yard punt early in the third quarter again set up the Longhorns near midfield and nearly turned into more points had it not been for redshirt junior defensive lineman Christian Rector recovering a fumble inside the Trojan red zone.
The lowest point of the night, and the play that truly signaled the end for the Trojans came when the Longhorns blocked and returned a 50-yard field goal attempt for a touchdown, injuring McGrath in the process.
Heading into a make-or-break Week 4 matchup against undefeated Washington State on Friday night, the entire team has a lot of questions to answer. For as much as head coach Clay Helton and offensive coordinator Tee Martin will come under fire from fans and media alike, it’s possible that no one will have more to lose this weekend than special teams coordinator John Baxter.
Baxter, the former University of Michigan special teams coordinator who presided over the team’s infamous botched punt against Michigan State in 2015, is no stranger to controversy in the kicking game. Between his time in Ann Arbor, seeing Rose Bowl winning kicker Matt Boermeester dismissed from the team before the 2017 season and presumptive starter Michael Brown tearing his ACL around the same time last year, Baxter has experience dealing with such adversity. The question now is: What will his plan of action be?
While it’s often an advantage of the college game, rather than the pros, to carry a roster of 90-plus players, the drawback is that teams can’t dip into a free agency pool when they sustain injuries. This becomes especially difficult when considering injuries to special teams players as there is usually much less depth and are much tougher to replace.
On the roster currently, USC carries another three kickers who could potentially replace McGrath for the rest of the season. Brown, now recovered from his ACL tear, true freshman Alex Staudhaus and converted quarterback Thomas Fitts.
A fourth option may exist in an otherwise unlikely place: the women’s soccer team.
While allowing a women’s player to try out for the Trojans would be a first in the program’s history, it wouldn’t be the first time it has happened in Division I football. Better yet, USC wouldn’t even be the first Pac-12 team to allow a woman to walk on.
Although not yet a member of the Pac-12 conference, Colorado added Katie Hnida as a walk-on to the team for the 1999 season. A placekicker for her high school team, Hnida did not see action with the Buffaloes but would go on to be both the first woman to score points in an FBS game as well as the first to play in a bowl game as a member of the New Mexico Lobos.
With no varsity men’s soccer team and the extremely strong track record of the two-time national champion women’s team, the Women of Troy are possibly the best options that USC has for walk-ons.
If there were ever a unit in college football that wasn’t scared of trying new things, it would be USC special teams. Over the past two years, redshirt junior long snapper Jake Olson has been an active participant in every practice and has appeared in three games despite having lost his sight at age 12.
With the season taking a turn for the worse that it seemingly has and fans calling for the heads of seemingly every coach on the staff, the Trojans could do worse than to seek out a new rallying point in the form of a walk-on kicker.
Will the Trojans again seek to make history and serve as a progressive frontier for college football as they did in the ’50s and ’60s with integration of black football players? Most likely not, but they could do a whole lot worse than letting some of the many talented women on campus try out to kick for the Trojans on Saturdays.

(From left to right) Will Hochman and Grantham Coleman captivate as Jason and Chris, the production’s two leads. (Photo from Instagram)
“Sweat” is a simple story -— that describes how people are different, yet provides a vision of unity. The play, which was performed at Mark Taper Forum, welcomed people of all backgrounds on Saturday. 
“Sweat” follows a few friends who work in a small factory in Reading, Pa., one of the poorest towns in the country. The play jumps between 2000 and 2008, two different eras for the group. 
The production begins in 2008 and as the play unfolds, the audience learns about  the events that tore these friends apart eight years prior. 
As friends are promoted, tensions come to a high as the livelihood and jobs of everyone else are on the line. In the midst of it all, the play infuses political commentary on former U.S. President George W. Bush’s administration and its policies on immigrant workers and lower-middle class factory workers.
“Sweat” is ultimately about the struggle between outsiders and insiders. It’s a story of people who built the nation from the ground up in pursuit of the American Dream.
While writer Lynn Nottage’s words create colorful, flawed characters who are often too stubborn, the cast brought them to life. Lisa Peterson’s direction provides much-needed humor to highlight the story’s turns. The impeccable set design creates an atmosphere for the storyline.
The main characters’ performances make the story human and characters likeable. Michael O’Keefe gives a terrific performance as Stan, the diplomatic bartender trying to keep his friends together, and Portia demands power on stage as Cynthia, a headstrong woman who must make the difficult choice between her work and  friends. 
The chemistry between the two leads, Will Hochman as Jason and Grantham Coleman as Chris, is kinetic, riveting and emotional. 
While some interpretive elements do not hit as hard as they could have and a couple performances are one-dimensional, the production is a powerful story that needs to be told in the current divisive political climate.
While the play is set during the Bush administration, its themes are more relevant than ever under the Trump administration. 
As the friend group fragments because of hate, the story is representative of the divisive nature of contemporary American politics and culture. The play leaves the audience grasping the consequences of the characters’ and our society’s hate. But there is a glimmer of hope at the end. A hope of a reunion, even a fractured one. All our society can do is pick up the pieces and heal from the damage done.

Over 2.5 billion people worldwide use social media to share their lives — spending time with friends, sharing news stories, traveling, eating at a trendy restaurant, going to college and so on. What we don’t talk about, however, is how this constant engagement with others’ lives affects our own.
I, like many members of the Gen Z, was raised on the internet. I got my first computer at age two. I (by watching YouTube videos at age five) learned how to play the guitar. Heck, I even tried making videos myself as an adolescent (a truly cringe-worthy part of my past that follows me everywhere). This past summer, I interned for a company where my sole job was to increase the company’s online presence by making content for social media. 
Quite literally, the internet is a part of me, and I don’t know who I would be without it, which is sometimes a scary thought. Of course, as many people have noted, there are both advantages and disadvantages to one’s constant presence on social media. 
Yes, comparing my life to others’ lives via social media — whether or not I’m consciously doing so — has taken a toll on my mental health at times (a topic reserved for another column). On the positive side, though, I firmly stand by the notion that the internet is key for people to become modern, globalized citizens, which will ultimately create a more harmonious world. In other words, the internet gives us the opportunity to become “cultured” if we explore outside of our echo chambers, allowing us to understand ourselves and others better.
For instance, Twitter — my personal favorite social media platform — is often considered the frontrunner for discussing current events and their implications. When there’s breaking news, Twitter is the first platform I look at to pull articles from a variety of sources, gauge the public’s general reaction and, or course, see how users have already watered down the situation into a meme. From a journalistic position, Twitter can be an excellent means for gaining diverse perspectives on an event, but that’s only if users chooses to branch outside of their viewpoint. 
Along those same lines, liking and retweeting things to prove awareness lends users to become passive social media activists, which is one of the biggest problems with social media.
 Twitter, nonetheless, has become society’s main tool for direct public conversation with political leaders, celebrities and other figureheads, creating unprecedented access to information. It’s just up to us how we utilize that information for better or worse.
Additionally, the internet and social media have opened up vast opportunities for work and education that did not exist 10 years ago. For someone like me, this new opportunity holds a special place in my heart because I wouldn’t even be at USC without the internet. Having been raised in a small town in Florida where most people spend their entire lives, my addiction to YouTube — though it definitely damaged my eyesight — exposed me to places and lifestyles different from anything I could have encountered in my sheltered hometown. As a result, I fell in love with Los Angeles, despite never visiting it until I was accepted into USC. I wanted nothing more than to attend a university where my passion for internet culture and content creation could manifest into something real. 
The power the internet wields in our personal, professional and political lives is fascinating because only decades ago, the whole concept of social media seemed absurd. The fact that we can pull up the president’s Twitter account and see that, yes, he really did just tweet that, or that someone can start an entire career by posting photos on Instagram invites a world that once seemed unreachable to be closer than ever before. It’s phenomenal and terrifying at the same time, and that’s why it deserves to be discussed.
So, I bring you the first installment of my column, “Internet Cultured” — an invitation to explore our collective online world and understand how the content at our fingertips affects our real lives. If anything, I want to blur the lines between life online and life offline to demonstrate that the power of social media isn’t just in what you present, but in what you follow through with. Here’s to making new connections, both on-screen and off.

In 2015, a diverse coalition of USC students launched a movement to bring attention to urgent issues of diversity on campus, and demanded support from University administration. The students were mobilized by student protests against discrimination on college campuses nationwide, as well as USC’s own racist incidents. This movement saw students protesting full-time outside Bovard Auditorium, hosting student forum after student forum and developing a comprehensive campus climate resolution that students presented to the University administration. 
Their legacy reflects the power of student voices. Eventually, these tireless student-led efforts culminated in the creation of a one-time Diversity Fund of $50,000 for the Undergraduate Student Government to spend with full autonomy, financed by the University. The purpose of this fund was to support projects and initiatives by USC students and campus organizations promoting diversity and inclusion. Last year, the fund was used to aid undocumented students’ re-application fees for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. 
If this is the first you’re hearing of the Diversity Fund, unfortunately, you’re likely in the majority. Since its inception, lack of awareness and mismanagement has led to the underutilization of the fund. 
From funding the first steps in bringing rape kit access to campus, to erecting a permanent DREAM Center, to offering diversity training to DPS officers, to supplying basic reproductive health care products to low-income students, and so much more, there are many diverse, daily student needs that the Diversity Fund has the power to address. But without the continued security of annual renewal, awareness of the fund’s availability and responsible, balanced and compassionate oversight of the fund, it is unable to live up to its most fundamental mission.
Two weeks ago, we — both former and current USG members —  introduced a bylaw to the USG Senate that would ensure that fund is fully renewed every year, fully accessible to all and responsibly, conscientiously and representatively dispersed.
Currently, the fund is overseen solely by the USG president and vice president without a formal application process. The failure to renew the fund has created a climate of exclusivity in which those who oversee the fund are pressured to reject more projects than they accept in order to preserve the remaining amount. This, by extension, discourages the students who need it most from seeking it. Skeptics of the bylaw suggest that the Diversity Fund’s full renewal is unnecessary due to “low demand” for funding. In doing so, they make the mistake of equating lack of awareness to lack of need. 
To address these flaws, our bylaw would create a diverse, representative oversight board comprising the USG treasurer, chief diversity officer and a representative from each USG cultural assembly to make decisions aboutfund allocation. The bylaw would also establish a formal application to acquire funding, publicize the fund and critically ensure that however much of it is used by the end of the year, it is fully renewed to $50,000 at the beginning of every year.
We feel strongly that budget allocation is a reflection of values — what the student government chooses to spend its financial resources on is the ultimate testament to its priorities. Apparently, it is a radical notion to some that diversity matters on the USC campus, and that USG’s financial choices should reflect that. We find it disappointing that exorbitant spending of student programing fees for retreats, catering and merchandise for USG staff are met with nowhere near the same internal pushback.
Here on our campus, among our very own student body, women, people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ+ folks, disabled people and many more members of marginalized groups struggle to access basic resources they need not only to survive, but to fully thrive as members of the Trojan Family. 
As authors of the fund, we are aware of the fact that $50,000 is insufficient to fully address every identity-based issue on our campus. But we have heard the voices of our supporters from each cultural assembly, including the Black Student Assembly, Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, International Student Assembly, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Latinx Student Assembly and Queer and Ally Student Assembly, among others, who recognize that responsible oversight of the Diversity Fund as a critical first step — one with vast, untapped potential.
The USG administration and many of the senators elected to serve identified diversity as a high priority on their platforms. But actions speak louder than words. And the words “diversity matters” ring hollow without support for legislation that would bring pro-diversity projects to life. 
This bylaw amendment, which will be voted on Oct. 2 to allow time for public comment, grants senators the opportunity to quite literally put their money where their mouths are. We hope they’ll take it. And we hope the undergraduate student body will attend senate meetings, make their voices heard and hold their elected representatives accountable to the fulfillment of their campaign promises.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Last week, after I ended my hour-long interview with Tyler Hiebert, a doctoral student focusing on contemporary Native American issues, I came to the conclusion that the American treatment of its Native population is far worse than I understood.
Hiebert told me that Native Americans are the most disadvantaged group in nearly every socioeconomic indicator: wealth level, education level, mental illness, substance abuse. The list of devastating issues goes on and on. After our discussion, I was convinced that the grievances endured by indigenous people, especially violence toward women, must be acknowledged by the American people, who all too often conveniently forget about the lives and struggles of their indigenous peers.
“One of the biggest problems facing Canadian and American reservations is missing and murdered indigenous women,” Hiebert said. In Canada, the number of First Nations women who have gone missing or been murdered since 1970 is estimated to be between 1,000 and 4,000. Hiebert is certain that number is much higher in the United States but to an unknown extent.
There is no consensus on how frequently Native women are disappearing and getting murdered on reservations —  one of the reasons academics like Hiebert are studying this issue so closely. The most cited number is from the National Crime Information Center, which estimates that there are 5,172 missing Native American women, although experts like Hiebert believe that number is higher, factoring in unreported incidents and bureaucratic missteps.
Native American reservations are designated sovereign nations, which allows indigenous tribes to self-govern within the United States. The FBI and the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs do have law enforcement jurisdiction over reservations and their interference and resources are reserved for the most serious crimes. In the crucial first 24 hours after a person goes missing, Native Americans are often left with what former North Dakota Federal Prosecutor Tim Purdon called “undertrained and underfunded” tribal police forces. Combined with the lack of physical and human capital in the sparsely populated, massive geographic areas of reservations, a missing person is less likely to be found there than in a crowded urban setting. 
This lack of law enforcement resources is a deadly combination with the high rate of domestic violence and abuse occurring within Native American communities — which could also be an effect of mental health and substance abuse on reservations. The Indian Health Service lists intimate partner violence, which includes such crimes as domestic abuse, sexual assault and stalking, as a “significant” problem in Native American and Alaska Native communities. A 2008 CDC study found that 39 percent of Native women surveyed identified as victims of intimate partner violence. Native American women have a magnified risk of violence, and it is sadly safe to assume that some of this violence ends in deaths that never get solved.
It’s vital we acknowledge the structural causes of violence against Native American women on reservations, but we must also acknowledge and correct the racist root of this violence.  While explaining the causes of the murder epidemic’s severity, Ivan Macdonald, a member of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana, told the Associated Press: “It boils down to racism. You could sort of tie it into poverty or drug use or some of those factors … [but] the federal government doesn’t really give a crap at the end of the day.”
I can understand why Macdonald is pessimistic about seeking a solution to this murder epidemic. Throughout its history, the United States has enacted legislation and perpetuated discriminatory actions toward Native Americans. But to recognize the subconscious racism of this particular crisis, we don’t have to look farther than the outsized media coverage of missing or murdered white women. The media — and conservative media in particular — is quick to provide constant coverage of disappearances and to demand action when young white women go missing, an impulse fully on display this summer when 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts went missing and was found tragically murdered in Iowa. 
Missing person cases should be handled with aggressive media campaigns and thorough search missions; any missing person case is a pressing issue that deserves concern and attention. But public attention has neglected the thousands of missing Native American women on reservations spanning decades. White women’s deaths are afforded more attention and resources than Native American and Alaska Native women and girls. 
The lack of resources and attention Native Americans are receiving to combat this epidemic of violence further hinders them from achieving equality. How can this population fight for the respect and resources it deserves when it hasn’t even been assured freedom from murder? 
“We know about serial killers who just prey on indigenous women because they know they can get away with it,” Hiebert told me. The epidemic has killed thousands of women and men for  generations, and it’s time for the country to respond to the crisis more aggressively — through supportive social and economic policies — to ensure the safety of Native American women.

After student reporters were asked to not report from inside of USC’s first public presidential search forum, Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso issued an apology in a campus-wide statement Monday. Caruso said the Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media are welcome to report on and attend future presidential search forums.
“Unfortunately, at Thursday’s campus-wide forum, student media reporters were mistakenly told by a University Communications staff person that they were not permitted to report from inside the session,” Caruso wrote. “That was not accurate, and some student media were reporting from inside the session.”
During the second presidential search forum on Monday, Caruso said, “The media from Annenberg and Daily Trojan were mistakenly precluded from coming to the listening session. I apologize for that, and we welcome for them to be part of this process and they are an important part of this process.”
On Thursday, both the Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media, a school-sponsored media platform, were asked by a USC spokesperson to report from outside of the Presidential Search Advisory Committee’s first public search forum. 
The spokesperson told a Daily Trojan reporter that they could attend the forum, but could not take notes or quotes from inside the event. The Daily Trojan continued to report from inside the forum.
Following the event, the University stated that “contributors need to feel comfortable sharing their perspectives freely, which is much easier to do in a session that is not being recorded or reported on.”
In his statement on Monday, however, Caruso said that the restrictions had not been an administrative or Presidential Search Advisory Committee decision.
“I apologize for this and we remain committed to ensuring that these campus forums are open to all of our USC stakeholders, including the Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media,” he wrote.
Allen Pham, editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan, responded to Caruso’s statement.
“While Thursday’s incident was unfortunate, the Daily Trojan is happy with USC’s decision to allow student media to report at future forums,” Pham said. “We look forward to continue holding our University accountable and reporting at events that affect students and the community as a whole.”
Caruso’s public statement comes after the Daily Trojan’s editorial board and some USC community members criticized the University’s decision to ask student media not to report from inside the public event.
“The Daily Trojan exists as a watchdog for the University and by asking us to stop doing our jobs, or by barring us from being able to report on matters central to the well-being of the student body, the administration is asking for unimpeded liberty to act as it pleases behind closed doors,” the newspaper’s editorial board wrote about the incident last week. “Our voices matter, and we will not back down.”
The Daily Trojan will be attending and reporting on all future forums, including Monday’s session at Aresty Auditorium on the Health Sciences Campus.
