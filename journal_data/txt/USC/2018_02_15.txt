As class registration for the Fall 2018 semester approaches, most USC students will follow the familiar pattern of adding and removing classes within our WebReg portals until the schedules we’ve designed achieve the magic scheduling trifecta: the necessary courses at the right times of day, led by the right professors — the ones who make rolling out of bed for class bearable. Some may even do the unthinkable and schedule an 8 a.m. or Friday class if they think a certain professor is worth it. And to deem their worthiness, many turn to the professor ranking website, RateMyProfessors.com to see how the wide array of professors at USC measure up. 
With over 19 million ratings, 1.7 million professors and 7,500 universities in its database, RateMyProfessors.com markets itself as “the largest online destination for professor ratings” and “the highest trafficked site for quickly researching and rating professors, colleges and universities” in North America. 
The site invites reviewers to assign numerical rankings, from one to five, in the categories of overall rating and level of difficulty. It then asks whether or not the reviewer would take a class with the professor again, if the class was taken for credit and whether the textbook and attendance were mandatory. In addition to leaving a comment about the professor, reviewers can select up to three predetermined “tags” that best describe the professor from “tough grader” to “inspirational.” Reviewers can even grant professors red hot chili pepper icons if they find the professor attractive. 
Having established itself as a readily accessible resource during the stressful weeks of class registration, RateMyProfessors.com has become the go-to for college students seeking the scoop on their potential professors, and often appears as a top search result when a professor’s name is searched on Google. Many USC students pore over these ratings when choosing their courses and sections. However, USC students, and college students in general, often regard the reviews as sacred, relying far too heavily on the specious site when making their vital course registration decisions. 
It’s worth noting reviewers identities’ are never given or verified. Because the site operates on an anonymous basis, there is no way of ensuring that the reviews are written by actual students who have taken a course from that professor. Even more concerning, because professors are growing increasingly aware that their online reputations precede them, it could even be the professor leaving glowing and self-gratifying reviews on their own pages in hopes of boosting their ratings. 
Perhaps the biggest weakness of the site is that one of the main criterion of a professor’s rating is their level of difficulty. As a result of this algorithm, it is the “easy” teachers who receive positive recognition. In fact, the top-rated professor on RateMyProfessors.com for the 2016-2017 school year was rated only 1.9 for difficulty. Yet most of us know that easy teachers are not necessarily the best ones for our education. It is often in our most challenging courses that we grow the most as students and as people, and when students earn a high grade as a result of hard work and dedication as opposed to an easy A borne from free-riding, their sense of satisfaction is exponentially higher. 
So on a misleading site where charisma is more rewarded than credentials, our perceptions of a professor can become skewed before we even give them a chance. In fact, subscribing to other people’s beliefs that a professor is phenomenal or terrible before students even experience their teaching firsthand often becomes a dangerous self-fulfilling prophecy.
Additionally, as online consumer review methods used on popular sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor have gained traction over the past decade and are now an integral part of everyday decision-making, it is important to keep in mind that reviews can tend toward extremes rather than reflect the common view. In fact, according to a 2016 research study conducted at Harvard Business School, people generally only leave reviews when they’ve had an unusually positive or negative experience, as this is the only way they are invested enough to devote the time to leaving a review.
Ultimately, while review sites can be a tool in our decision-making arsenal, they shouldn’t be the sole deciding factor for whether to take a certain class with a certain professor. Students should not base decisions about their education on reviews from RateMyProfessors.com alone, instead taking the reviews as points of information rather than the truth. And professors shouldn’t get sucked into being popular on the site, mistakenly believing that the reviews accurately reflect the wisdom of the masses. After all, the top professors on the site are not necessarily the top professors in the nation. 
Realistically, most of us will continue to use the site to inform our Fall 2018 registration process, as it is one of the only resources available for gaining intel on professors before registering for classes. However, it is important that students proceed with caution and take what they read on the website with a grain of salt, keeping in mind that one site in no way tells the whole story about a professor.

Last week, members of the news media were placed in the awkward position of deciphering which was the more important story: the allegations that former White House secretary Rob Porter beat his ex-wives, or that members of the White House staff — including Chief of Staff John Kelly — many have known about the allegations prior to the news breaking. Within a day of allegations against Porter surfacing, allegations that former White House speechwriter David Sorenson had also beat his former wife were reported on as well. While both Porter and Sorensen promptly resigned, not only was the White House confusing and contradictory in its claims about when they learned of the accusations, but President Donald Trump was also unsettlingly amicable in his subsequent statements about both men, as he wished them the best and praised their job performances and characters. Over the weekend, he shared a tweet lamenting how accusations were ruining men’s lives. 
Placed in context with the Trump administration’s history, while still concerning, Porter and Sorensen are hardly anomalies. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief adviser, was charged with a misdemeanor in 1996 for assaulting his ex-wife. (The charge was dropped later on.) Trump’s first labor secretary nominee removed himself from consideration after old allegations that he assaulted his former wife resurfaced. Tim Nolan, one of Trump’s state campaign chairs in Kentucky, pleaded guilty to multiple counts of child sex trafficking on Friday. 
Additionally, on top of adamantly defending Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly, two men with laundry lists of women who have accused them of sexual misconduct, the president himself has been accused by over a dozen women of similar misconduct. These accusations include one from his first wife that he had allegedly beat her and committed spousal rape, dating back several decades ago. In 2015, Trump’s lawyer claimed marital rape was, “by definition,” impossible.
Violence against women and domestic abuse seem to be more prevalent in this administration than perhaps any in recent history, which isn’t much of a surprise to anyone with a vague idea of Trump’s platform stacked with policies that negatively affect women. But it’s not just the Trump administration. Domestic abuse remains a problem in this country at large, and a problem that’s too often buried and neglected in the absence of high-profile news like what has emerged from the White House recently. 
According to the latest statistics compiled by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, every minute, 20 people face physical abuse from an intimate partner. One in three women and one in four men have been the victims of physical violence by an intimate partner. One in five women will face sexual assault or attempted rape, with the perpetrator more likely to be someone they know and are close to than anyone else.
Violence against women is arguably among the first causes feminism took on, which often leads to the misconception that it has become an obsolete issue. In feminist scholar Rebecca Solnit’s Men Explain Things to Me, a book that reads as an almost prophetic examination of the Trump era, gendered violence is a focus of the work, as it analyzes how the erasure and dismissal of women’s voices has been a quiet, key factor in perpetuating domestic abuse. In many anecdotes recounted by Solnit, women who come forward to report being stalked, threatened or abused are dismissed by law enforcement and those around them, eventually yielding fatal consequences. 
Stories like those of the women whom Trump’s aforementioned former staffers allegedly victimized are all too common because of pressures to remain silent, and the misogyny and inaction they face upon coming forward. The lack of available resources and politicization of violence against women form yet another barrier. Republican-led dissent against the Violence Against Women Act, most recently due to its inclusion of anti-discrimination clauses for immigrants and LGBTQ folks in 2013, has always plagued the law from its passage to its renewal. More recently, funding for rape kits and adequate reproductive health care for survivors — a seemingly bipartisan issue of women’s safety — is also often strained across party lines.
Violence against women is finally receiving attention again due to revelations in the Trump administration. And while recent, high-profile events certainly deserve our attention, so, too, do the thousands of cases taking place every day out of the public eye.

If you don’t know Rosalind Crane, the newest, soulful singer on the pop scene, it’s time to become acquainted with her soothing, laid-back sound. Crane, who performs under the stage name Rozzi, is a Los Angeles-based songstress and USC Thornton alumna who just released a new single, “Never Over You,” this past Friday, replete with relatable lyrics and emotional, moving production.
Rozzi signed with Columbia Records after graduating from the Thornton School of Music with a degree in popular music. Photo from Facebook.
Rozzi said the song was a vivid description of her state of mind at the time. 
“[The song] really fits within this storyline, it captures a moment of living,” she said. “I was in a fight with my boyfriend, and I was over the relationship, but not over him.”
Rozzi, a rising star in the industry, is signed to Columbia Records, which has worked with A-list musicians such as Adam Levine. She described her new music as songs that relate to the theme of “coming of age,” and added that “I would say [my music] is very personal, emotional and soulful.” 
Rozzi said her talent and passion for music began at a very young age, growing up with a range of musical influences from Bjork to Beyoncé. Rozzi said she knew she wanted to be a musician after she sang a Jewel song at her first grade talent show. 
“I sat down on the bleachers after I did my song, and I knew that’s what I wanted to do for the rest of my life,” she said. 
She enrolled in the Popular Music program at Thornton in 2009. After Levine heard a song she wrote with a classmate, he emailed her about a record deal. Eventually, one thing led to another, and before long she was touring the world opening for Maroon 5. She released two EPs, “Space” and “Time,” in 2015, and is now currently in the process of finishing up her first LP set for release later this year.
Rozzi said she wrote over 250 songs before choosing the tracklist for her debut full-length album, seeking to create the most honest possible depiction of her life.
“The biggest difference between making this album and the last two EPs is that I was really growing as a person when writing these new songs. I also wrote a lot more,” Rozzi said. “It was a process of really making sure that I made the music that sounded like me.” 
In order to accomplish this, Rozzi said she had to experience a lot of personal growth. After transitioning to a new label, she pushed herself to reach her full artistic potential, listening to “the voice in [her] head” that said there is more to her creative ability than she had discovered thus far.
“I lived out loud, going from singer to artist and girl to woman,” she said. Now, she hopes her upcoming album will reflect this major change in her life and career.

In more ways than one, R&B singer Erykah Badu connected generations of music fans at the Shrine Expo Hall on Tuesday night. Tapping surging bassist and producer Thundercat to open the night as well as play bass during her set, she impressed fans of all ages and put on a performance that will not easily be forgotten.
Badu’s signature eccentrism was on full display throughout the evening, and it was clear from the outset that the program would run on her own time. The band initially summoned her appearance with an extended medley of “Rim Shot” from her debut album Baduizm into “Hello” off her newest release But You Caint Use My Phone and the R&B pioneer slowly crept her way onto the stage, captivating the audience with her regal stage presence as they loudly voiced their approval.
Dressed in a bright pink sweatshirt and gray sweatpants underneath a tweed pinstripe coat, Badu’s outfit could have just as easily been the first option that fell out of the wardrobe as it could have been carefully put together. Accentuated with a white top hat and matching sleeves bearing colorful patterns in a quilted design, she gave the audience plenty of time to appreciate her attire as she took a bow in the middle of her entrance, before fumbling around on the beat machine next to her center-stage stool and finally opening her mouth to sing.
Badu’s vocals were simply piercing in a live setting, and she often dominated the soundscape as she belted out the notes. Singing “Out My Mind, Just in Time” from under a shimmering pyramid of lasers, her voice filled the arena along with the band’s impressive instrumentation, making for one of the highlights of the night.
Badu visited the Shrine to do more than just sing, however, taking the time to preach peace and unity while also enlightening the crowd with incredible stories of her career. While taking a break from the music to highlight Thundercat’s musical prowess and timeline their long history of working together, she revealed that the two briefly dated while on tour several years ago, before boasting to the delighted crowd how her love paved the way for his success as a musician. 
Badu is known for her quirky signature style along with her piercing vocals and experimental sound. Photo courtesy of Steve Rose.
Thundercat’s set, which preceded Badu’s, was filled with intricate jam sessions, all performed at full volume with no restraint. The sound system in the Shrine, while well-equipped for the booming rap concerts that often take place in the venue, was initially ill-equipped for his live instrumentation, making it somewhat of a challenge for fans to find the groove. Sound quality did eventually improve toward the end, in time for him to close out his set with an impressive rendition of “Them Changes” that had every head in the crowd bobbing excitedly. Weaving cuts from Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly that he produced with some of his own classic songs like “Heartbreaks + Setbacks,” Thundercat’s soothing falsetto permeated the entire performance and created an enjoyable experience, despite the sound issues.
For Badu, however, the night was something of a celebration, taking place the day after her landmark debut Baduizm’s 21st anniversary. 
“Baduizm was for the ’90s babies,” Badu expressed at one point between songs, drawing cheers from younger members of the audience. She embraced the many newcomers who were seeing her in a live setting for the first time, announcing that she’d been waiting for them to “grow up” so that she could truly share with the next generation.
Taking full advantage of the opportunity to connect with the youth, the singer played plenty of material from Baduizm, the highlight being her jazzy rendition of “On & On” early in the evening. “Next Lifetime” and “Appletree” were also standouts, both of which put smiles on faces the moment the initial note was struck. 
Badu didn’t forget the rest of her fans, however, covering old-school hits such as “Don’t Stop the Music” by Yarbrough & Peoples. The futuristic, funk-infused production meshed well with the celestial atmosphere the singer created throughout the night, from her robotic yet cultural outfit to her impressive stage design.
At times, the experimentalism teetered on the edge of venturing too far into the beyond, such as her decision to decelerate the groove on “Window Seat” to a near standstill where even the 808’s seemed frozen in time. Always aware of when she was on the verge of losing her audience, however, Badu never failed to whip the band back into action the instant that all appeared lost, bringing the audience back to reality. It wouldn’t be a true Erykah Badu experience without a few moments of uncertainty, but by the time it was all said and done, her superior artistry reigned supreme.

While I was studying for macroeconomics this past weekend, I felt compelled to listen to Frank Ocean’s “Thinkin Bout You” after hearing The Theorist’s piano cover. Immediately, crystal clear images of my previous school, UC Santa Barbara, emerged in my mind. Sometimes I would recall various events, but mostly, what I seemed to remember the most were emotions blurred with the various places I frequently passed by.
Art by Deena Baum | Daily Trojan
Obviously, I also had feelings of uncertainty during my first weeks at USC. But, listening to “Thinkin Bout You” specifically blended the similar doubts I felt at UCSB with my walks past the lagoon or roaming around Isla Vista. I listened to this song so many times during my first quarter at Santa Barbara that I’ve forever associated those 10 weeks with this song. It was one of many symbolic connections that I make between songs and various aspects of my life.
Whenever I look back on certain songs or albums, they each seem to represent distinct emotions tied to specific events. On one hand, making these connections is understandable; if an event heavily influenced your life, then it’s nice to have a memento of it. For example, I will forever associate Macklemore’s “Can’t Hold Us” with my time in “The PAPER,” my high school newspaper. As the only sophomore on the staff, I wanted to get along better with the rest of the writers and section editors. After one issue was delayed, I willingly went up to the front of the classroom and began singing and dancing to the 2013 hit. The performance was so beloved that it soon became a common occurrence during late nights.
Even though I only listened to Third Eye Blind’s “Jumper” one time while hanging out with my friend Dylan two summers ago, it reminds me of each time we met up during those three months, and I strongly associate it with that entire summer. 
Looking back, the songs that held the most meaning for me were tied to phases of my life. At the end-of-the-year pep rally during my senior year, two students performed The Head and the Heart’s “Rivers and Roads” as a goodbye song to the entire senior class. Every so often, I listen to this song to remind myself of those months as the slow, acoustic melody perfectly captured the bittersweet feelings I had during this time.
An important factor that went into creating any connections, event or phase was to ensure that one song would not be associated with more than one event. “HUMBLE.” could’ve been a perfect encapsulation of my third quarter at UCSB, as Mike WiLL Made-It’s production is so discernable that it could bring about the anxiety I had while I waited to hear back from USC or the campus atmosphere when I passed by UCSB’s Storke Tower at night.
However, because Kendrick Lamar is my favorite modern-day musician, I continually listened to the single throughout the rest of the year. Thus, its sole connection to UCSB disappeared as various emotions and events from throughout the rest of 2017 (ones that weren’t as impactful, might I add) blurred with the distinct ones strictly associated with UCSB until it didn’t easily define one phase of my life.
Honestly, I could probably compile a playlist for the songs that defined each quarter at UCSB. Attributing life experiences to songs enables you to recall moments of your life that could’ve unknowingly helped form you as a person or were positive memories that are worth looking back on. At its most effective, relics of our past can indicate distinct phases of our lives, which is what “Thinkin Bout You” helped remind me of after I casually put it in my queue.

A trip to the desert resulted in a dry spell for the USC men’s basketball team last week. The Trojans suffered a pair of losses to Arizona State and Arizona during their most recent road trip.

USC’s 80-78 loss to the Sun Devils on Feb. 8 saw them go scoreless over the final two-and-a-half minutes of regulation. In that same span of time, ASU finished the game on a 9-0 run to steal the contest from the Trojans in the final moments.
In a game which could have granted USC a share of the Pac-12 conference lead with a win, the Trojans got off to a fast start against Arizona. 
With 9:08 remaining in the first half, USC was leading the Wildcats 20-18. After calling a timeout, Arizona proceeded to go on a 9-0 run, giving the Wildcats a lead they would not relinquish for the remainder of the contest.
“Two of our last three games have been lost at the buzzer. We’ve found ourselves in a couple of challenging road games,” USC head coach Andy Enfield said. “We’ve been playing good basketball, but we’ve just had some unlucky bounces at the end of those games. We ourselves have been the cause of some of those unlucky bounces by missing shots late in games that other teams have converted on.”
USC’s 81-67 loss to the Wildcats extended the Trojans’ current losing streak to Arizona to eight games. Moreover, the Trojans’ rough fortune in Arizona continued further last week: USC has now been swept in its last eight consecutive road trips to the Arizona schools.
The losses to ASU and Arizona extend USC’s current losing streak to three games.
USC will host Oregon at the Galen Center Thursday night, looking to avoid a four-game losing streak. The Trojans last underwent a four-game losing streak during February of the 2016-17 season which sent them downward in the conference standings.
“We’re still positive, and we’re excited for the chance to play these Oregon schools,” said USC junior forward Bennie Boatwright, who has averaged 14.2 PPG this season. “It’s definitely a big week for us.”
The Ducks will enter Thursday’s contest coming off of an 84-57 home victory over Washington State. Oregon has won five of its last six games in conference play and currently sits third in the Pac-12 standings.
In the win over WSU, Oregon sophomore guard Payton Pritchard recorded a game-high 19 points (7-of-13 FG). Pritchard is the Ducks’ primary offensive weapon, as he leads his team in scoring this season, averaging 14.4 PPG.
On Jan. 18, USC defeated Oregon on the road in Eugene 75-70. Boatwright and junior forward Chimezie Metu each chipped in with 18 points for the Trojan victory. The win snapped USC’s 14-game losing streak to the Ducks, which dated back to the 2009 season.
On Thursday night, the Trojans will look to end another losing streak against Oregon. USC is winless in its last seven home games against the Ducks.
“We’re just going to have to defend. [Oregon] is a very talented team with a lot of guys who can score the basketball,” USC sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic said. “Our team is able to bring a lot of size and length on defense. So it’s just going to come down to playing hard on defense.”
Despite its recent losing skid, USC is still very much in the race in the Pac-12 standings. The Trojans are currently tied for second in the conference standings with rival UCLA. With five conference games remaining, USC is just two games behind Pac-12 leader Arizona.
The Pac-12 conference in general is still very much up for grabs. In what resembles a clustered mess, the conference standings show that the eight teams currently slated in the No. 2 through No. 9 spots in the Pac-12 are all separated by just one game or less.
The Pac-12 Tournament in Las Vegas begins on March 7. USC concludes the regular season with a pivotal game against UCLA on March 3.
“We’re extremely excited about what can happen over the course of these final five games,” Enfield said. “But right now we are completely focused on playing well against a solid Oregon team.”

Just a few days after extending head coach Clay Helton’s  contract to stay through the 2023 season, the football team has announced that it will do the same for offensive and defensive coordinators Tee Martin and Clancy Pendergast.

“Consistency and stability are so important in improving your program every year,” Helton said in a statement on Monday. “Having both back will help us to our goal of having national championship-caliber seasons.”
Coaching in their respective positions for the past two seasons, Martin and Pendergast have helped lead USC to consecutive New Year’s Six bowl appearances with trips to the Rose Bowl and Cotton Bowl.
Martin, a 1998 national championship-winning quarterback with Tennessee, began his tenure with the team in 2012 as a wide receivers coach. In his time at USC, he helped develop former Trojans and current NFL stars Marqise Lee, Robert Woods and Nelson Agholor. Over the past two seasons, Martin has led the USC offense to consecutive decades-long highs in total yards per game with 477.1 yards in 2016 and 481.1 in 2017. 
Martin’s name came up in a few head-coaching rumors this off-season, including at his alma mater of Tennessee. The Volunteers ended up settling on Alabama defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt after an extended head-coaching search. 
 Defensively, Pendergast has re-energized the Trojans. In 2017 USC tied all other FBS programs at the top with 46 sacks led by senior Uchenna Nwosu, who tallied 9.5 sacks on the season. After being defensive coordinator for USC for the 2013 season, Pendergast left for two years to serve as the linebackers coach for the San Francisco 49ers. Since he returned for the 2016 season, USC has been one of the strongest defensive units in the Pac-12.
 Off the field, both Pendergast and Martin have been instrumental in keeping USC atop the college football recruiting world. Both of the recruiting classes that these coaches have been a part of shaping, 2017 and 2018, have been ranked among the top five in the nation according to 247sports.com.
This season, 247 ranked Tee Martin as the second best recruiter in the Pac-12 behind USC linebackers coach Johnny Nansen.

The USC men’s volleyball team fell to UCLA in a three-set match on Valentine’s Day. The Trojans had low hitting percentages in each of the three sets, being in the negatives in the second set. The Bruins showed more consistency, hitting near .550 in two of the three sets. USC averaged a hitting percentage of .141 throughout the whole match, while the Bruins held up .458.

No. 2 UCLA now boasts a 14-1 overall record (3-0 in the MPSF). 
Junior outside hitters Ryan Moss and Jack Wyett lead the Trojans with nine and six kills, respectively. Wyett added his defense with four blocks and four digs. Outside hitter Lucas Lassone also contributed four kills. Gianluca Grasso, their usual starting outside hitter, was out due to a concussion. Usual setters Chris Hall and Gert Lisha ran their offense, each with nine assists.
With their latest loss, the Trojans fell to 4-9 on the season. They are now in danger of falling out of the AVCA Coaches’ Top 15 rankings. 
For the Bruins, junior outside hitter Dylan Missry lead the offense with 12 kills, along with senior opposite hitter Christian Hessenauer with 11 kills. Their starting setter Micah Ma’a had a total of 39 assists, significantly helping secure their win over their rivals. 
Next the Trojan men’s volleyball team will travel to Malibu on Saturday where they will take on No. 12 ranked Pepperdine. The Waves will be coming off a four-set victory against UC Irvine. Last time they met, the Trojans won in a competitive five-set victory at home. Pepperdine men’s volleyball currently holds a 6-3 record (2-1 in conference) recently defeating Concordia, Irvine and losing to Grand Canyon University. 
Pepperdine is currently working their .278 hitting percentage as a team, and averaging 12.4 kills per set. Their offense is led by senior outside hitters Colby Harriman and Alex Harthaller. Junior outside hitters David Wieczorek and Michael Wexter have contributed to the Waves’ offense with their high hitting percentages. Max Chamberlain holds down the middle blocker position as a junior, with a .353 hitting percentage and averaging .95 blocks per set. Redshirt senior libero Weston Barnes leads the Pepperdine defense along with the impressive efforts from redshirt freshman setter Robert Mullahey. Mullahey runs the court as a setter, averaging 10.53 assists per set. 
The Trojans are prepared to take on what is projected to be a hard-fought battle. Wyett, who currently leads the MPSF in number of kills, reflected on the fight against the Waves. 
“It’s a good opportunity to capitalize our talent away and just keep building a good record in the conference,” Wyett said. “Another good opportunity to get better as a team.”
With the team dipping well below a .500 winning percentage, USC players recognize they have a lot to work on ahead of their next contest.
“It’s gonna take time [to improve],” redshirt junior middle blocker Connor Inlow said. “But consistently practicing with an aggressive mindset and making sure that everyone’s doing their job to know that we can build trust.” 
While the Trojans have a lot to work on as a team, they are working hard at practice every day to reach their goals. 
After the Pepperdine match on Saturday, USC will face Concordia University and Grand Canyon at the Galen Center next week.

Eric He | Daily Trojan
Let’s be honest: When you think of the stereotypical athlete, you don’t think of someone of Asian descent. When you think of Olympic legends from Team USA, Asian Americans don’t usually come to mind.
This is why I am proud of what has happened so far at the Winter Olympics in South Korea. There are a record 13 Asian Americans competing for the United States, and half of the 14-person figure skating team is Asian American — also a record. Of these athletes, two — snowboarder Chloe Kim and figure skater Mirai Nagasu — have already become household names, and a third — figure skater Nathan Chen — is expected to contend for a gold in the free skate.
Kim claimed gold in the women’s snowboard halfpipe on Tuesday, essentially clinching first place on her first run. She then tweeted about being “hangry,” before proceeding to drop a 98.25 on her victory lap by pulling off back-to-back 1080s — a really hard thing to do — just for the fun of it. 
Nagasu made history on Monday when she became the first American woman to complete a triple axel — also a really hard thing to do — in the Olympics. And despite falling during his Olympic debut in the team skate, Chen is heralded as the next big thing and will have all eyes on him in a matter of days.
My fellow columnist Julia Poe touched on a similar lens earlier this week when she wrote about Adam Rippon, a gay and outspoken American figure skater, and his impact on the LGBTQ community. Rippon’s personality is magnetic, his skating is authentic and his interviews have become must-watches. He is an inspiration, a role model for those who may look at him and say, “If he can make it, so can I.”
I feel the same way about Asian American athletes. There aren’t a lot of role models out there for us. Until I figured out I wasn’t good enough at basketball to play professionally, I dreamt of making the NBA. By default, I idolized Yao Ming, not for his height, but for his identity and what he represented. He was all we had. Before YouTube existed, I spent my free time foraging NBA.com for his highlight clips and I’d make my family watch them with me. I took such pride whenever he scored on guys like Shaquille O’ Neal, and I recall voting for him multiple times every year to make the All-Star team.
I’m sure many others who grew up in my generation have similar experiences, much like today’s kids might look up to someone like NBA star Jeremy Lin. It’s not like we only look up to athletes of our own skin color — I may or may not have an actual painting of Stephen Curry hanging in my room — but there’s something especially comforting about seeing another person from your heritage and culture make it big, especially a culture that has been as underrepresented and stereotyped as often as Asians have been. 
People like to say that we are smart, not athletic. Specifically, we are book smart, not street smart. We are supposed to be in the classroom or in the lab, not on the field or in the weight room or the press box. Believe me, I’ve gotten my fair share of glances when I walk into press boxes filled with predominantly white, middle-aged men.
This is a stereotype that may not be as explicit as stereotypes for other cultures. But it’s there. We all think it, whether we want to or not. And it takes something like what’s happening in the Olympics right now to change it.
It takes Chloe Kim, who looks like any other 17-year-old kid but with extraordinary abilities, to command a snowboard, to inspire the next Chloe Kim, to propel that young girl sitting in class to believe that people like her can make it to the Olympics. 
Kim’s father arrived in the United States from Korea in 1982 with $800 in his pocket and quit his job to help Chloe achieve her Olympic dreams. Her background is so relatable to children of immigrants like me, whose parents did similar things so their kids could have a better life. Same with Nagasu, whose parents own what NBCSports.com describes as an “unassuming Japanese eatery” in Arcadia, Calif. They actually missed their daughter’s historic triple axel because they were working the dinner rush. 
Or Maia and Alex Shibutani, the American sibling duo who became the first ice dance team of Asian descent to win a medal when the U.S. captured bronze in the team event earlier this week. 
“When we started skating together, Maia and I didn’t see any teams on the ice that looked like us,” Alex wrote on Instagram. “Throughout our career (14 years and counting), we have had to, and will continue to push past stereotypes, labels, doubters and cynics.”
It takes people and stories like this to blaze a trail, to change minds and break stereotypes. It takes viral moments like Kim tweeting about wanting ice cream in between runs or figure skater Vincent Zhou snapping back at a reporter who tweeted that ice skating wasn’t a sport to show that not only are these talented athletes, but they also have vibrant personalities like any other star athlete.
I doubt that such stereotypes will sweepingly vanish any time soon. It will take more than a few stories or tweets for the erasure of racism. But what we’re seeing thus far in these Olympics is promising and gives me hope for the future.

A vigil took place in the United University Church to light candles and pray for those killed in Wednesday’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., which has left 17 dead. 
Pastor Sunny Kang (right) spoke about the importance of holding vigils to prevent people from becoming desensitized to an increased number of school shootings. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
Pastor Sunny Kang led the vigil, which was attended by six community members. Previously a pastor in Miami, Kang said that his former congregation included members from Parkland. Hours before, he said, the UUC sanctuary was full of churchgoers attending Ash Wednesday service. Kang learned of the shooting upon leaving mass and set out to research school shootings over the past decade. 
“Columbine happened in 1999, Kang said. “That means that incoming freshmen grew up all their lives with this idea of the shooting that happened. They are the post-Columbine children.” 
Kang stood at the head of the church and read statistics off a list, each the number of shootings that had taken place every year following Columbine.
“In 2018, there were already seven school shootings, and we’re only 45 days into the school year.” Kang said. “How long will this go on?”
Tearful attendees shared their reactions to hearing about today’s shooting. Annemarie Guillen, a senior studying business administration, spoke about the chaos and fear she experienced during the false alarm of an active shooter on USC’s campus the day after the Las Vegas shooting. 
“I was numbly devastated,” Guillen said. “It’s something that happens now … it feels like every month. It feels like [it’s] now a thing and that makes me really sad and upset.”
Guillen plans to participate in Teach For America after graduation and is nervous for her future students. She wants her classroom to be a “safehouse,” but fears that there could be tragedies like this outside of her control. 
“What is being done to help this?” Guillen asked. “Nothing. Nothing at all.” 
Kang said the importance of these vigils is to prevent people from becoming desensitized from mass or school shootings by realizing that behind every number is a human being and their family. He said these deaths affect communities and how people treat one another. 
“If we become too numb to these things, then we become to what happens [in] other kinds of events,” Kang said. “Pretty soon, other people will become numb when we become victims. We can’t become numb.”

With presidential debates live-streamed on social media, campaign signs posted along Trousdale Parkway and volunteers actively canvassing for votes near Tommy Trojan, the whole University knows when Undergraduate Student Government elections are in full swing. 
But every year, another, quieter election process takes place, and most students — especially undergraduates — may not be aware of it. The Graduate Student Government elections are markedly different from the USG process — for example, graduate students don’t directly elect their president or vice presidents, and senators are elected by individual academic schools or departments rather than by the graduate student body as a whole.
While the USG Senate consists of 12 members, the GSG Senate is much larger; it currently has 65 senators, each representing either a USC graduate school or a department within the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences graduate program. The number of senators per program is determined by the number of students in the respective program. This ensures that each senator represents 2 percent of the graduate population, but that no more than six senators represent any one program, according to the GSG constitution. 
For comparison, USG’s 12 senators represent an approximately 1,583:1 student-to-senator ratio, while GSG’s 65 senators represent a 407:1 student-to-senator ratio, based on student population statistics available on the USC website. 
“The large number of senators we have lends to student voice in GSG more because the senators directly represent student populations,” GSG Director of Elections and Recruitment Linda Ly said. “Senators should be students’ first point of contact for any issues they want to bring to GSG.” 
Each academic program has its own procedures for selecting senators to represent them in the GSG Senate, and must do so by the first two weeks of the following fall semester, according to the GSG constitution. 
In contrast, USG senators are representative of the entire student body rather than specific student populations. In the past, USG has had six residential, three Greek and three commuter senators, but made a change in 2016 to allow anyone to run for any of the 12 seats, allowing for a more accurate representation of student constituencies.
The senators, along with the USG president and vice president, are elected in mid-February each year after an extensive campaign process. 
“Our campaign period begins toward the end of January, this year on Jan. 25,” said Daniel Zhu, USG senior director of communications. “Campaigns last for a little less than a month, and there are two debates for the presidential and vice presidential tickets, and we have a senate forum for the senate candidates to share their platform. Then we have our voting period from Feb. 13-16, so those are the days where students can vote. After the voting period, we use the weekend to count the votes and then prepare reports, and on Feb. 20 at 7 p.m., we announce the results during our Senate meeting, and then the new administration begins building up their staff.”
Voter turnout for USG elections in previous years has been abysmal and steadily decreasing; this year’s administration is making an effort to increase voter accessibility. 
“We’ll have four voting booths set up this year, which is one more than last year,” Zhu said. “We have one in the USC Village Piazza, we have one by the Lyon Center, one at Leavey Library and one at the Tommy Trojan statue. We selected those points because we felt they were the most optimal places to receive high voter turnout. All voting can also be done online, so our website has a button with access to the voting portal.”
In contrast, GSG does not directly elect any of its senior officials. The two major executive positions within GSG, the president and the Health Sciences Campus director, are selected by the Senate in a simple majority vote after giving speeches that are up to seven minutes long to the Senate. 
GSG President Kristopher Coombs, Jr. said this is because graduate students are less engaged with their governing body, and thus, elections would be a futile effort. 
“Historically, graduate students don’t bother,” Coombs said. “Undergraduates already have a low turnout rate anyway, so it would be even less with graduate students. So we have the Senate vote on behalf of the student population, and unlike with undergraduates, senators are elected by their specific program or school.”
The executive board is also made up of three vice presidents and 20 other director positions, all of which are selected by a committee made up of outgoing and incoming executive board members who must be confirmed by the GSG Senate, according to its constitution. 
“Most of the time we like to see students who have had past GSG experience on the e-board, so it’s often formed of past senators who have already been elected by students before,” Ly said. “Candidates [also] have to go through an interview process.”
The USG selection process for executive board positions is similar to that of the GSG’s, with the incoming presidential ticket selecting nominees who are then confirmed in a supermajority Senate vote. 
“A lot of the appointed positions are actually just specialized positions, so most of the time, we judge based on skill alone,” Zhu said. “Any USC student can apply, and they go through an application and interview round. After the president and vice president make their selection, they are presented to the Senate and they can approve or disapprove. And this applies to all appointed positions.”
While USG election results and their executive board picks won’t be complete until later this semester, the 2018-19 GSG executive board has already been chosen. Next year’s president will be Jocelyn Yip, who currently serves as the vice president of administration, and the director of HSC will be Nivedita Kar, who is currently the HSC director of equity and equality, according to Ly. A full list of 2018-19 GSG executive board members can be found on the Daily Trojan website.
Despite not being directly elected, Coombs believes the GSG is still able to adequately represent its students, in part because they don’t need as much representation as undergraduates might. 
“Right now, the model is that we communicate things to the senate, and the senate communicates to their direct constituents,” Coombs said. “A lot of graduate programs are shorter than undergraduate programs, so their engagement with the University at large is a little less important, as well as any outside commitments they may have, including their family or their job, pressures that most undergraduates don’t have. Their life is not centered around school as much as it is for undergraduate students.”
Besides their structures, USG and GSG also have different goals due to a difference in undergraduate and graduate student needs.
“Many of the initiatives are similar, like everyone cares about parking on campus, or bikes on campus — I think the difference in large part comes from funding and age,” Coombs said. “Graduate programs are by and large more expensive than undergraduate programs, so financial aid, and grant and scholarship programs [are something we focus on]. Because graduate students tend to be older, they might have kids, different health needs, things like that.”

This month, the USC Price Center for Social Innovation will unveil a new professional development program — the Southern California Symposium. Participants will investigate the social problems existing in Southern California — ranging from housing to educational opportunities — and work to develop practical solutions.

The core of the program will take place at USC over four weekends from February to May. Twenty-five individuals will be selected from a pool of applicants for the opportunity to receive an Executive Education Certificate in Social Innovation upon completion of the course.
The course is designed for professionals seeking to expand their knowledge, enhance their value as employees and solve problems that benefit the community.
The curriculum for the program — the first of its kind from the Price Center — is the product of more than 20 interviews conducted by USC professor Roberto Suro, the director of the symposium. 
“I spent a lot of last summer in a set of conversations with a lot of different people,” Suro said. “I interviewed people who were involved with philanthropy, thinkers that I respected, public officials, politicians, some academics and asked them, ‘If someone asked you to do this, what would you do?’ And over time, a few things started to coalesce.”
The objective is to solicit ideas from some of the region’s greatest minds in order to construct an ideal program for students.
Suro collaborated with USC Price professor and Price Center Director Gary Painter, as well as senior visiting fellow and director of studies for the spring 2018 symposium, David Morse, to develop the course.
Each weekend session will feature a distinguished leader or advocate from a non-governmental organization. Participants will also have the chance to converse with panels of local policymakers and hear prominent scholars give insight into issues like housing, transportation and economic development in Southern California.
Unlike most programs, the topics covered in the course are not limited to those selected by the faculty. 
Students are encouraged to bring in issues from their professional fields for discussion and collaboration in search of solutions.
Additionally, the learning continues beyond the weekend sessions.
As Painter points out, the course is intended to be both theoretical and pragmatic.
“One of the goals of the symposium is not just to teach people new approaches to solving these kinds of problems but also to have them actually do something practical,” Painter said.
The course employs case studies to accomplish this. Working online and in small groups, students will team up with faculty to tackle various social problems in Southern California. Their efforts will culminate in a specific policy solution, which they will present at a fifth session in June.
Although participants will come from diverse backgrounds, Morse hopes to give them cases that expand their scopes and push them to learn outside of their designated fields.
“We’ll try to make sure each person is working on something that relates to their work but also takes them beyond the boundaries of their own experience and training,” Morse said in a USC Price Center news release.
While the issues addressed in the program center around Southern California, Painter explained that the principles are applicable anywhere.
“The approaches that are inherent in social innovation are just general approaches and processes for how you address problems that are different from our traditional approaches in the social sector,” Painter said.
Suro expanded on the course’s relevance outside of the region.
“A lot of the issues you see elsewhere,” Suro said. “Issues like gentrification or the move away from automobile transport to other forms of transportation or the desire to do that. Issues like homelessness … Those are all common to a lot of metropolitan areas but the intent is to do something that is regionally focused and to make this about a place.”
The program’s ultimate goal is to study the long-term challenges here, in Southern California, and develop solutions that will positively impact the people living in the region, Suro said.

Three USC professors have found a way to combat deadly bacteria through a computer-simulated study.
The study was conducted using computer simulations. Photo from Viterbi School of Engineering.
USC professors Priya Vashishta from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering; Rajiv Kalia from the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences; and Aiichiro Nakano from Viterbi, were hired in 2002 by President C. L. Max Nikias to conduct the study.
“We were hired jointly in three separate departments,” Vashishta said. “The idea was to establish a group who would do simulations using computers. You need all three of those departments for this kind of study.”
Simulations have become an increasingly common research method. Conducting research on a computer lessens the cost of materials and shortens a lengthy, repetitive trial process, Vashishta said.
The professors, along with Aravind Krishnamoorthy, a Viterbi postdoctoral fellow, used simulations to find the optimal conditions for killing the bacteria, even with the presence of spores, which are a protective mechanism developed by bacteria to allow bacteria to withstand most harm.
“Once they go to the dormant state, nothing [can] kill them,” Nakano said. “No radiation, no chemicals — they survive. it’s extremely hard to kill in this dormant state of the spore. Basically the simulation found how much heat and how much water content is needed to make it easy to kill the bacteria.”
The study is rooted in the concept that a certain amount of water and heat cause bacteria to germinate before detecting conditions are harmful and entering spore mode, which makes bacteria impossible to kill.
“You allow it to germinate but not to go into full spore mode,” Vashista said. “So if you just barely germinate, you’ll be able to kill it. At that point of wet heat, we will kill [them], and that is the simulation.”
The computer simulation revealed that the bacteria can be killed at the optimal temperature of 90 to 95 degrees Celsius with a water concentration above 30 percent, according to Vashista.
Once the bacteria is in the right environment, they are killed with black silicon nanopillars, which Nakano described as similar to a “bed of nails.”
The research project was funded by a grant from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, who’s looking for ways to combat bacteria as a biological weapon.
“The funding comes from the DTRA, as they are primarily interested in find out how and when these bacterial spores die,” Krishnamoorthy said. “It’s important because if you’re trying to disinfect something with the presence of this bacteria, you have to be sure that these bacterial spores die. They want to know what are the conditions in which these things die, because if you don’t kill them completely, they can come back.”
Krishnamoorthy said the study will have real-life applications. It can be used to counter biological weapons, lessen the spread of bacterial diseases and provide breakthroughs in food preservation.
