The coronavirus testing positivity rate was 5.7% among students and 4.7% among employees between Jan. 23 and Jan. 29, down from respective highs of 14.8% and 12.5% the week of Jan. 2. There were more total cases this last week than the week before, with 1728 total cases recorded last week, as a result of more students being on campus.
Monday was the deadline for eligible students to submit proof of their booster vaccine. As of Monday, 67% of graduate school students and 63% of undergraduate students reported their booster shots. Students who are not boosted will now be required to test twice a week to access campus and will possibly receive a registration hold.
“We think those numbers will start to start to pick up as more people submit their data now that the deadline has passed,” Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman said. “So where we are right now, we’re feeling very positive about the direction we’re heading in with [coronavirus] as we are moving out of this surge.”
If positivity levels continue to decrease, the University is hoping for the semester and current restrictions to begin to look more “normal.”
“We are really looking at, beginning of March, beginning of April, [if there will] be opportunities if things continue to improve here in USC and in the community to start to scale things back,” Van Orman said.
Students who live on campus and test positive must quarantine in hotels provided by the University, free of charge. The standard isolation period is 10 days from the date of a student’s positive test, however, students who are asymptomatic or exhibit few symptoms have the option to take an antigen test on their sixth day. If the antigen test is negative, students are allowed to leave quarantine early. 
According to Van Orman, currently about half of the students choosing to take an antigen test are testing positive and must remain in quarantine. Students who leave quarantine early may still be infectious and are advised to take caution, wear a mask and avoid crowded spaces.
“We’re trying to determine what is that group of people that we think are much less likely to be contagious, so that they could get back to work to school sooner than the 10 days,” Van Orman said. 
According to the University, when a student tests positive and needs a space to isolate, they can indicate if they need assistance in traveling to their designated location. The University Self Isolation Coordination Team “will then coordinate transportation.” Many students who have tested positive take ride-share vehicles to their quarantine location, entering the vehicle with non-consenting drivers.
The University works with the USC Hotel, as well as a few other hotels in the area, for student isolation spaces. As of Tuesday morning, 250 quarantine spaces were occupied and there were about 600 open spaces for students.
“As the surge sort of comes down, we should be fine with isolation spaces for the rest of the semester,” Van Orman said.
Currently, there are no plans by the University to stop providing free quarantine locations for students. According to Van Orman, if the coronavirus became endemic and more like influenza, it is possible there would no longer be a quarantine requirement. Any change in isolation requirements would follow a change in the county health officer’s quarantine orders.
There were some levels of short staffing at USC as a result of the omicron surge, Van Orman said. About two to three weeks ago, several USC units were experiencing loss of employees and difficulty carrying out jobs because of staff needing to quarantine. However, according to Van Orman, as cases have fallen at USC and in the community, staffing is improving. The University has been watching the issue “very closely” in case outbreaks occur in small units and cause a significant amount of staff to be on leave. 
According to Van Orman, in order for the coronavirus to become endemic, there must be significant outbreaks without overwhelming the healthcare system or causing significant illness and morbidity among vulnerable populations. In addition, there cannot be new variants that cause severe disease, and more antivirals and therapeutic agents would need to be developed to treat people who are at high risk.
“I think we’re getting there. Most people believe that by the end of 2022 or sometime within 2022, we’re going to start treating this more like we might be treating other viral illnesses, provided we don’t have any huge surprises,” Van Orman said.

In an open letter to the USC administration, members of the University chapter of the American Association of University Professors called for Cost-of-living Adjustments to faculty salaries for the 2022-23 school year. The letter, which has garnered more than 740 signatures from faculty members across all schools at the time of publication, compares the last two years’ raise pools of 0% and 2% to the cumulative rise in the cost of living in Los Angeles of 7.59%. Effectively, it states that faculty are earning 5.56% less now compared to two years ago. 
Howard Rodman, a professor of cinematic writing for screen and television and president of the AAUP, said the decision to circulate the open letter stemmed from the “confluence of many mighty rivers,” particularly the high consumer index in L.A. and the “very low” rise in faculty salaries. The AAUP found the amount in real income that faculty members were losing to be “substantial,” he said. 
“We just wanted to keep [the open letter] … factual and say, here’s what it would have cost for us to keep up with the living in Los Angeles and propose the solution, which is very simple and which is something that people in many, many, many different places do, which is an annual adjustment for cost of living,” Rodman said.
Christina Dunbar-Hester, an associate professor of communication and vice president of the AAUP, said faculty members were “understanding” of the University protecting its bottom line amid the “uncharted territory” at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020. However, when it became apparent that the University’s financial health wasn’t as heavily impacted as expected  — USC’s endowment fund grew from $5.7 billion in 2019 to $5.9 billion in 2020 before reaching an all-time high of $8.1 billion in 2021 — faculty concerns about salary grew, Dunbar-Hester said. 
“The combination of knowing that the institution … had wound up better than the worst projections, the sting of inflation, the sting of our raise pools being highly curtailed, all of that kind of came together at once,” Dunbar-Hester said. “That was what prompted the need to speak up collectively.”
COLAs are a “long-standing” practice in place throughout the University of California system, where the latest salary increase of 3% for existing faculty was approved in October 2021. Rodman said the AAUP isn’t looking for a “quick fix” or a “one-time payout,” but an automatic adjustment to faculty salaries that continues to remain in place after the upcoming 2022-23 fiscal year.
“This is designed to be a very long-term, systematic change in the way that the University treats its employees, not just a one time course correction,” Rodman said.
AAUP’s hope, Rodman said, is that the COLAs will become a baseline raise, with merit-based bonuses and other raises added on separately. Departments evaluate faculty to distribute limited merit raise pools, Dunbar-Hester said, without consideration for cost of living. These bonuses being the only way for faculty to increase their salaries despite rising costs of living is “difficult,” she said.
“We care about the University, and we want to help keep the University in a great place, and having everybody treading water or losing ground with wages isn’t good for the institution to retain great faculty [and staff],” Dunbar-Hester said.
In an emailed statement to the Daily Trojan, the University wrote that addressing the issues demonstrated in the open letter, which has yet to be formally presented to the University, is a “priority.”
“Fair, equitable and competitive salaries are very important to attract and retain excellent faculty,” the statement read. 
Faculty members who signed the open letter, Rodman said, feel as though their salaries are addressing the rising costs of living “less and less,” which he said is, for many, a “disincentive” to remain at USC. 
“Those of us in the professional schools can certainly make more money outside of academia and, at a certain point, you don’t want to feel that you’re paying in order to be a professor,” Rodman said. “You don’t want the budget of the University of Southern California to be balanced on faculty, staff and employee salaries.”
Though the open letter is confined to the concerns of faculty members and not all USC employees, both Rodman and Dunbar-Hester said this is reflective of the domain of the AAUP, which primarily serves professors. The present campaign, Rodman said, isn’t intended to exclude University staff from fair compensation. The letter, he said, is instead a “beginning” to allow for broader changes down the line, and will be presented to the Academic Senate at its next meeting Feb. 16. 
“Everybody who works for USC … deserves a living wage and everybody deserves a wage that keeps up with the increase in the cost of living in Los Angeles,” Rodman said. “We see this as the opening salvo in a larger effort to make sure that USC treats its employees as they should be treated.”

Black History Month kicked off at USC in a Zoom Webinar with a prayer led by Reverend Najuma Smith-Pollard and Jamilla Johnson’s rendition of the Black National Anthem.
Johnson, a junior popular music performance major, said she was happy to be part of something “for [her] people” at USC, because in “every classroom” she walks into, she’s the only Black person. 
“I was happy to be able to perform a song that means so much to so many people and represents, overcoming so much,” Johnson said. “I’m just happy to be able to be a part of that history and perform that for my peers.”
The event focused on this year’s Black History Month theme at USC: “Black joy” and “embracing health and vitality,” and it featured a mix of student, USC administrator and celebrity alumni speakers including President Carol Folt, Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Robert Woods and junior journalism major Reagan Griffin Jr.
After the national anthem, Harris introduced Folt, who spoke about the love and compassion Trojans have shown each other during the pandemic, USC’s and faculty’s anti-racism initiatives — including Vice Dean of the Gould School of Law Franita Tolson’s voting rights testimony on the Senate floor — and a “historic legacy of Black people” at USC. 
“Gatherings like today’s tell us all that we’re not alone. We’re part of a vibrant community, and there is so much joy in our Black community. And we have a great event today and a great month ahead,” Folt said.  
Folt introduced Woods, a USC alumnus, whose speech emphasized the importance of physical wellness during the pandemic. Afterward, Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer Christopher Manning spoke about his own experiences experiencing imposter syndrome at an “exclusive University,” finding joy through Latin dance and the “diversity of Black and brown people [that] made up Chicago’s Latin dance scene.”
“One of the things that I think is very important for Black folk, in particular, is to really try to be intentional and find [joy] because without it, you can be in an experience where you’re being ground down by the day to day realities of existence, but you’re not doing anything to build yourself back up,” Manning said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
Manning said the University is working to decrease the imposter syndrome he experienced by diversifying faculty hiring through creating training modules and implicit bias training for faculty search committees. 
“The more that we can bring diversity to our professional ranks, the more our students can see people like themselves and have more confidence in their belongingness at this institution,” Manning said.
Griffin Jr. spoke not only about Black joy but also the need to “be honest” about USC’s impact as an institution. He cited USC’s contribution to gentrification, profiling by the Department of Public Safety, stigmatizing the South Central community and the need for change that goes beyond discussions. 
“Once we’ve looked ourselves in the mirror and acknowledged the truth —that we are not an institution that historically has fostered and supported Black joy for students, faculty, staff and surrounding community — that we have in fact, done the exact opposite,” Griffin Jr. said. Once we’ve been honest with ourselves, about who we have been, it is then that we can begin to work to become who we hope to be.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Griffin Jr. said that he wanted to make sure to emphasize Black joy in his speech but to also highlight the ways that USC “not upheld those values” of joy, health and vitality. Beyond conversations, he said USC should make an “intentional and substantial reallocation of resources” toward recruiting and uplifting Black students, faculty and staff.
“USC has to be honest with itself about the role that it’s played for its students and for the surrounding community,” Griffin Jr. said. “That was what I was trying to get across in my speech. And that’s what I hope people take to heart and really engage with critically after hearing what I had to say.”
The event also featured a speech from musician and alumnus Aloe Blacc, who spoke about his positive experiences at the University, breaking out into his hits such as “The Man” while speaking about the importance of mental health and finding joy in light of cultural and systematic “challenges to our physical and mental health.”
Broderick Leaks, director of counseling and mental health at USC Student Health, said that from an institutional perspective, it is important that the University is celebrating these themes at the “highest levels of the University in terms of leadership.” Leaks spoke about the importance of Black joy in light of the dehumanizing ways the world engages with the Black diaspora. 
“Some people say that it is an act of resistance even in and of itself to have joy,” Leaks said. “And so I think it just shows the perseverance of our people to be able to hold on to humanity despite constant messages that were not human in some areas.”

A few weeks ago, I voiced some concerns to my supervisor in a private email about a new protocol that I, as well as most of my coworkers, considered exploitative and inconsiderate to our time. Instead of receiving a response or private meeting request, my supervisor interrupted a staff meeting and berated me in front of my colleagues and shared my private email with my entire workplace. They read each line out loud before criticizing it, scoffed at my concerns and then finally said: “Your tone in this email was very disrespectful.” 
Did someone say “hostile work environment?” Yeah, that was me, and after reflecting upon this encounter for the past month, I feel that it speaks beyond your typical supervisor-employee dynamic mishap. It speaks to our workplaces and standards of professionalism — what we consider appropriate and its foundation in white supremacy. It speaks to our society’s perception of emotions and their role in discourse. 
And, it speaks to the concept matter at the forefront of this column: respectability politics. 
Broadly, respectability politics encompasses policymakers’ condition to engage in discourse only if advocates present their demands in a socially acceptable way. During the Black Lives Matter protests, for example, the peaceful protest, as opposed to rioting and looting, existed as the golden standard of respectability. However, because we saw no policy change from the “respectable” mode of communication, which police forces nonetheless confronted with violence, advocates’ frustrations boiled over and some rioted. 
But the nation frowned upon these riots, partly because respectability politics detests emotions. According to “White Supremacy Culture,” an educational workbook, white supremacy instills a fear of open conflict in our workplaces and culture, with the dominant group “[blaming] the person for raising the issue rather than [looking] at the issue which is actually causing the problem,” “requiring that people ‘calm down’ if they are angry when anger often contains deep wisdom about where the underlying hurt and harm lies” and “equating the raising of difficult issues with being impolite, rude, or out of line.” 
In other words, instead of allowing the natural flow of emotions, the dominant group will refuse to respect these concerns unless the person communicates through a respectful avenue. 
However, the entire concept of respect roots itself in white supremacy. According to Studio ATAO, a nonprofit that creates educational content to drive social change, “Respectability politics upholds the idea that the supposed worthiness of a marginalized group should be evaluated — that is, by comparing the traits and actions of the marginalized group to the values of respectability set solely by the dominant group.” These standards manifest in workplaces, for example, where employers prohibit natural Black hair in favor of Eurocentric beauty standards. 
These respectability standards infiltrate our cultural understanding of civil discourse. From respectability politics, we cultivated the “agree to disagree” and “just chill” rhetorics. During the 2020 presidential election, you could probably pinpoint someone’s exact vote if they posted a colorful infographic along the lines of, “No matter who you voted for, I will forever love you and respect you as a person,” with white hearts in the margins. 
At that moment, many of us saw the issue with respectability: Discourse becomes tricky when we appropriate “agree to disagree” in the name of politics. We can disagree over Ariana Grande’s casting as Glinda the Good Witch in “Wicked,” but it seems egregious to apply this same logic to issues where complicity contributes to any -ism, violence and death. 
So whenever respectability prevails and the parties agree to disagree, what are we supposed to do — stand by and find comfort in the fact that some situations are just very complicated? Because the dominant group dictates respectability, however, buying into respectability politics merely condones the status quo.   
For example, we can look at the recent controversy surrounding USC student Yasmeen Mashayekh’s now-deleted tweets, in which she wrote, “I want to kill every motherfucking Zionist.” We can all probably agree: It’s not morally right to direct murderous intent toward anyone, regardless of identity. We can also agree that antisemitic and anti-Palestinian rhetorics do not belong on campus nor anywhere. 
However, we must also place Mashayekh’s language in the context of the Israel government’s occupation of Palestinian territories. I cannot say it better than the online petition that circulated in support of Mashayekh: “The language of the oppressed toward their oppressor is a form of personal resistance, as opposed to the colonial violence that the Zionist project has enacted against Yasmeen’s people — a people that has historically been brutalized at the hands of settlers.” 
By looking at Mashayekh’s language in a literal sense, we default to the respectability politics paradigm, where we can only take her frustrations and concerns seriously if she expresses them without the emotions and like the millions before her — to no avail. The dominant group, the Israeli government, still holds the support of the United States, and Palestinians still suffer from its colonial violence. By not acknowledging the clear oppressor-oppressed dynamic, we perpetuate its cycle of negligence. 
This isn’t me condoning that we all run around and commit violent acts against each other. I’m saying that we should challenge our perceptions of incivility. We should think about the marginalized among us, their humanity and the root of their emotions before concerning ourselves with tone. It’s the least we can do to confront respectability’s suffocating weight.

As February arrives, we are only six weeks away from the greatest postseason tradition in sports. Welcome to the first week of “Road to March Madness.”
When Evan Mobley left last season for the NBA draft, I did not imagine the potential that this year’s USC team has shown in the last two months. The Trojans currently rank No. 19 in the AP poll and previously ranked No. 5, the highest since the 1974 season.
While that rank did not last, it is a sign of the Trojans’ unexpectedly high ceiling this season. 
That being said, I felt an aura of skepticism amongst the fans shuffling into their seats when USC played UC Berkeley Saturday. 
Three tough Pac-12 losses left some questioning whether the Trojans were the real deal or just haven’t been challenged enough for their once undefeated record to ever have been legitimate.
Nonetheless, they took care of the Golden Bears handily, reminding fans of how talented they could be, but underscoring in a few key areas could hurt them down the road.
Free throws have been far from “free” for the Trojans this season. USC is currently ranked a staggering 340th in the nation from the charity stripe. At 63.73%, teams can purposely foul shooters with way less concern about them converting at the line. 
This issue came to light in the Stanford game, when junior forward Isaiah Mobley had a chance to tie the game with 2 free throws and missed the second. Stanford would complete its first season sweep against USC in seven seasons. 
This year’s Trojan squad is very physical on the defensive end, putting up high block numbers on opponents and shutting down the paint. However, if they cannot confidently take contact on offense and convert at the line, they are going to have a hard time against some of their Pac-12 foes that currently seem unstoppable. 
As USC irons out some of their fundamental concerns, Arizona and UCLA have been building impressive resumes. 
Arizona and UCLA are ranked No. 7 and No. 3 in the AP poll, respectively, and have shown few signs of weakness. The Trojans will face the Wildcats Saturday in a game that should provide valuable insight on where USC stands. 
Arizona Head Coach Tommy Lloyd is one of the brightest offensive minds in college basketball. Ranking No. 3 in the nation, the Wildcats’ fast-paced offensive scheme will be difficult, but not insurmountable, for the Trojan defense to manage. 
UCLA, on the other hand, is developing a reputation for their suffocating defense. Their full court press subdued Stanford just two days after they defeated USC. Deemed the “press that panics them all,” by Sports Illustrated in 1965, the press was credited for winning UCLA two championships in 1964 and 1965. 
USC has talented ball handlers but has suffered with turnovers at some points this season. Against Stanford, they struggled to keep possession, giving up 14 turnovers. However, they were able to turn it around against Cal, only coughing up the ball four times.
Ball handlers like junior guards Boogie Ellis and Ethan Anderson must stay vigilant when they face the Bruins. 
The Trojans have some work to do, but they undoubtedly have a fighting chance to upset Arizona and UCLA, improving their Selection Sunday stock in the process.
Checking on some possible Trojan postseason opponents outside the Pac-12, Kansas and Gonzaga come to mind. 
Gonzaga, the team that knocked USC out of the Elite Eight last season, ranks No. 2 in the nation with the current best offense in the NCAA, led by junior forward Drew Timme. 
The Trojans could face Gonzaga again in the Elite Eight or sooner. 
The recent ESPN Bracketology predicts that USC will once again fall within the same region as Kansas, a team that the Trojans steamrolled during the round of 32 last season. 
Kansas has improved since last season by many measures, and a matchup against this team could be one of the most entertaining of the year.
Kansas senior Ochai Abgaji is one of the best shooting guards in the country and might be a tough matchup for the Trojans. Conversely, Kansas would not have a clear answer for senior guard Drew Peterson. 
Based on recent trends, I think USC will be a No. 5 seed in the West, with a matchup against Gonzaga looming in the Elite Eight once again. 
Admittedly, even with all of this is speculation, USC could face completely different teams. The postseason is still over a month away, and performance against Arizona and UCLA in the next couple weeks will speak volumes about the Trojans’ March Madness potential.

Success is oftentimes measured by a quantifiable value. 
The hard truth is that while GPA and standardized test scores do not define you, they are certainly used to say something about you. Now, the number of publications you have are seen in a similar light for aspiring undergraduates and masters students who wish to pursue a career in academia.
I remember an intimidating conversation with a professor of a renowned research faculty who I admire. When I told him I planned on taking a gap year before applying to medical school, he jokingly called me a “wimp” and went on about how he started doing research when he was 15 years old and entered an early postdoctoral program. I laughed it off, but deep inside, I wondered, “Was I doing enough?”
Workaholic culture is very much ingrained in academia. At Med School Insiders, Dr. Amit Pandey details a step-by-step guide on how to get publications out of undergraduate research. For one of his tips, he writes, “find a research lab that publishes frequently.” 
From an admissions perspective, the most efficient and objective way to filter out strong applicants is by number. College students have to maintain high grades and achieve stellar standardized test scores in order to maintain a competitive applicant status for graduate and professional schools. Without a doubt, having a publication will make you stand out.
While “publish or perish” culture inflicts an unnecessary amount of stress on college students, it should not be discarded entirely because it is still important in the academic evaluation process. Publications are tangible outputs of achievement where hard work comes to fruition. 
However, the academic evaluation process is deeply flawed.
For researchers, it is either “funding or famine.” The more you publish, the more funding you receive and ultimately contribute to a higher university ranking position. However, climbing the ladder in academia is becoming a political game where it’s impossible to reach the top unless you stem from privilege or have back-handed connections. 
Academia’s dark and manipulative side breeds hush-hush culture. It is a threat to scientific integrity. Prestige is shaped by the number of publications you have. Journals are less likely to be cited if they produce negative results, despite being just as valuable to science, fueling production of low quality or unethical research to produce more publications. USC should offer more explicit opportunities for undergraduate students to get involved in research with the goal of publication.
Mentorship is key to undergraduate success and intellectual growth. The process of publishing as an undergraduate needs to be more transparent — there needs to be a focus on communication between professor and student. The number of hours you put into research may or may not translate into a publication. It may not be a numbers game after all but rather the hard work and dedication that will take you far. 
Our emphasis on scientific publishing prioritizes the journal over the book, deterring the value of other forms of publication, such as writing for a personal blog or school newspaper. There are a plethora of online platforms to publish with the same goal of producing and sharing knowledge.
While publications can serve as a stepping stone for one’s career, educating undergraduate students should be prioritized over research and publication thirst. We need to dismantle toxic academia to preserve good science and emphasize quality over quantity.

​​Twenty years ago, it could’ve been fun to talk about Bill Cosby. He was, after all, a comedian with one of the most groundbreaking careers that won Emmys, Grammys and, most importantly, the hearts and minds of the American public. Now, no one’s laughing. 
Compiled into four episodes, Showtime’s new docuseries “We Need To Talk About Cosby” begins by laying out the context of American comedy prior to and during Cosby’s rise to fame, with an emphasis on the role of Black comedians and the types of comedy they presented in order to find success. Known as “America’s Dad,” Cosby solidified himself by becoming palatable to the predominantly white audience of the time.
According to the series, Cosby became popular by “saying things of substance but not making others feel uncomfortable,” unlike notable predecessor Dick Gregory, the “first African-American comic to play to white audiences’’ whose comedical performances highlighted topics such as race, racism and the Civil Rights.
When considering the type of roles Black men would often be cast in around the time of Cosby’s growth in popularity and the impact that his premiere role in the television show “I Spy” had on the entertainment industry, “The reason a Bill Cosby stands out in the ‘60s is because he’s not playing these old, stereotypical Black roles,” said USC cinema professor Todd Boyd.  
Boyd explained that it is necessary to recognize the impact Cosby had on the American entertainment industry not only through comedy and television but also on the individual people watching from home who could see themselves represented by him. This explanation for why Cosby was so successful compared to his Black counterparts is a poignant note which serves an effectively presented purpose of the first segment of Director W. Kamau Bell’s docuseries. 
Transitioning from the focus on Cosby’s success and charm to the darker moments both behind and in front of the camera that the public ignored, right in the first episode, is a catalyst for quickly diving into the multifacetedness surrounding the elephant in the room. 
“Bill Cosby, it seems to me, has been leaving something like bread crumbs all throughout his career, pointing to his guilty conscience,” said Kierna Mayo, former editor-in-chief of Ebony Magazine, in the docuseries. The docuseries successfully sweeps up and presents these bread crumbs. Looking at everything from old interviews to sentences in books, the docuseries helps understand all of the signs that linked Cosby to the terrible things he did from nearly the start of his career. And “terrible things” is an understatement. 
Cosby sexually assaulted women, drugged them and raped them. He even made underhanded jokes about doing so with topics like “Spanish Fly,” while also moralizing lower-income Black people by blaming them for the systemic problems that negatively impact them. With over 2000 allegations and accounts from more than 50 women, Cosby was found guilty in 2018 of three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault. In 2021, his convictions were overturned. 
Even as Bell includes devastating accounts from the victims — from stories of disorientedly waking up in unfamiliar beds or being involuntarily intoxicated to the point of unconsciousness — he doesn’t tell the viewer how to feel. Being a sexual predator should diminish everything good someone has ever done, but many people love Cosby and still have a lot to process and understand. “We Need To Talk About Cosby” presents extensive evidence and information to help process the dichotomy of Cosby. As much as it would have been appropriate to immediately denounce Cosby entirely after he was found guilty, by not taking a black-and-white stance, this docuseries becomes a part of the beginning of this conversation rather than the end. 
In terms of the filming of the piece, there isn’t much innovation in the way that the content is presented. But, it’s not a narrative meant for pure enjoyment — it’s a documentary on one of the biggest serial rapists in Hollywood. Although a new or less common method of presenting the material could have been nice to further reel the audience in, the straightforwardness does the job of presenting the facts powerfully and candidly.  
Due to the sensitive nature of the docuseries, it’s necessary to note that this content is extremely difficult to digest. Many of the stories of what Cosby did to the women he assaulted are vivid and detailed. It certainly is challenging to process, so some viewers may have to be wary of the content and only attempt to digest if possible. 
Although the purpose of this piece is primarily to re-examine Cosby’s story, it doesn’t have all the answers to some of the most important and concerning questions. It is unable to answer exactly why Cosby, a man who seemed to have everything, did what he did, or why he continues to deny the allegations. Cosby’s defense team and publicists continue to paint him as a victim of systematic racial injustice with comparisons to Emmet Till. The question of how has this impacted society and Black America or how we can learn from the victims’ unimaginable horror stories and work towards building a safe space in the entertainment industry remain unanswered. 
Unanswered questions aside, this piece still plays an extremely important role in bridging the convoluted and nuanced understanding that many viewers have of Bill Cosby’s rise and subsequent demise, while also opening up a space for difficult conversations on sexual assault and the numerous instances of male-dominated privilege being used for harm in Hollywood. 
This piece also brings up a topic that is asked time and time again, yet constantly remains difficult to answer: Can you separate art from the artist? Bell encourages that question in this series by taking the time to delve deeper into all of the good Cosby did, not just the bad, but it’s also a decision viewers must make for themselves. 
Can we separate art from the artist? Sometimes, yes. When we’re talking about Cosby, no.

Sitting at 9-9 on the season, women’s basketball’s campaign has been a mixed bag so far. After starting 2-2 in conference play, a four-game skid has the Trojans at a 2-6 conference record and in ninth place in the Pac-12 with just eight games to play. Here are the four most important games remaining if USC wants to turn it around before the Pac-12 tournament. 
Feb. 6 versus Stanford
Likely the most difficult fixture of USC’s games left to play, No. 2 Stanford is undefeated in Pac-12 play and 16-3 overall. Despite a few early season losses, the Cardinal have found its stride on an eight-game winning streak. Before taking on USC, the Cardinal will face UCLA Feb. 3. 
The matchup will be the first and only time the Trojans and the Cardinal see each other this regular season. Last season, USC dropped all three games to Stanford by a combined 86 points. 
The Cardinal have four players averaging double digits in points this season, proving a handful for opposing defenses. USC will look to reverse history and pull off the upset at Galen Center Feb. 6. 
Feb. 13 at Washington State
The Trojans lost 71-63 against the Cougars Jan. 14, despite a 20-point effort from sophomore forward Jordyn Jenkins. USC led Washington State 17-3 at the end of the first quarter, but couldn’t capitalize on the lead. The Cougars outscored the Trojans 68-46 in the final three quarters to complete the comeback. 
USC will travel to Pullman, Wash. looking for a better result, starting with the defense. The Trojans allowed four Washington State players to hit double digits in scoring, including a 20-point outing from junior guard Johanna Teder. 
Feb. 20 versus Colorado
USC’s first conference game of the season was a blowout 71-58 loss at the hands of Colorado Jan. 7, and now, the team will need to get a better result against the Buffaloes to keep their NCAA tournament hopes alive. 
The Trojans will need to figure things out on the offensive side of the ball. They shot 41.1% from the field, still losing despite holding the Buffaloes to 34.7% shooting. Colorado took 16 more shots than USC, capitalizing off of second-chance efforts and forcing 20 Trojans turnovers.   
Graduate student forward Jordan Sanders suffered a knee injury in the away game against Colorado which sidelined her for four games until Jan. 28. Her return to the lineup could bolster the Trojans on offense.
Feb. 26 at Arizona 
The 76-67 upset win over the then No. 4 ranked Wildcats Jan. 9 was the first marquee win of the season for the Trojans, and Arizona will also be their final opponent. A win to close out the season could be a momentum boost heading into the Pac-12 tournament. 
USC will have to figure out how to limit senior forward Cate Reese, who carried the Wildcats’ scoring with a 29-point outing against the Trojans. 
The Trojans also caught fire from beyond the arc against Arizona last time out, shooting 57.1% on 3-point attempts en route to their win. If USC can reproduce its shooting numbers, the team has a chance at another upset.
