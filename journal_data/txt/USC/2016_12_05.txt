In this last week of poems, I am responding to the recent election. During the week of the election, I was busy with schoolwork and didn’t really have time to actually let the knowledge of its repercussions sink in. It began when I was walking to class one day
and I saw a white male standing there, and my heart raced. Adrenaline rushed through me as I ran up the stairs. I cringed at the sight of a white man and I didn’t understand why. When I sat down in lecture, I realized what happened: I was scared of what he would do to me because I was a minority. After everything sank in, I wrote these poems. I tried to cover as many issues that have arisen from the election. If I tried to cover all of them, I would not stop writing poems about the issue. There are so many complexities to the election and the inflamed discrimination, and it would be difficult to cover them all. I am just one voice in the movement. This election will continue to inspire more incredible art, and here is the beginning of mine.
DEAR RED BRICKS:

Steven Vargas | Daily Trojan

This poem is about the day after the election. Protests erupted, and so did disregard. My social media was filled with people saying that we were “overreacting.” This is my response.
SHE AIN’T MOVIN’:

Steven Vargas | Daily Trojan

I wrote this poem after hearing about discrimination targeted toward Muslims. My friend who attends the University of Michigan received crime alerts about hate targeting Muslims around campus. One report stated an unknown man demanded a Muslim student to “remove her hijab or he would set her on fire.” This is my response.
NOT YOU:
Steven Vargas | Daily Trojan

I heard about a group of Latinx students creating a human wall at a USC protest and found it so powerful, especially as a Mexican-American student. This is my response.
SIREN’S LULLABY:

Steven Vargas | Daily Trojan

In this poem, I discussed police brutality. Since I was young, I always feared the police, and I didn’t know why. I respected them because I knew that was what I was supposed to do, but there was also something inside of me that told me to run the other way when I saw a police officer. The tension created by police brutality continues to grow. This is my response.
LETTER TO THAT ONE PERSON WHO HAS ALL OF US UNDER THEIR CONTROL:


Steven Vargas | Daily Trojan

I heard that Trump was trying to correct himself. He told his supporters to respect minorities, trying to undo what he created. This is my response.
DON’T TOUCH HER!!!:
Steven Vargas | Daily Trojan
Trump said that he wanted to “grab her by the pussy,” and now there are men who think that it is okay to do so without consent. This is my response.
YOU CAN’T STOP US:

Steven Vargas | Daily Trojan

This is a poem of empowerment. We will not stop. We will not let discrimination stop us from letting our voices be heard. What is your response?

Developing a daily or weekly routine is extremely important. Studies show that people who develop a routine are generally happier, less stressed out, and have more leisure time than people who do not follow any sort of routine.
In high school, developing a routine was fairly simple for me. I started and ended school at the same time every day, I completed my homework assignments immediately after I got home from school, I had cheerleading practice and club meetings at the same time every week, I only went “out” on weekends, and I always slept for at least eight hours each night. However, developing a routine in college has been more difficult for me. Unlike in high school, my school days in college start and end at different times each day of the week, my club meetings that I need to attend often vary in meeting times, I go “out” on weekdays and weekends, and I usually sleep at least five hours each night. My current situation certainly does not resemble that of a traditional balanced routine. I feel stressed and busy all of the time.
Due to these constant feelings of stress and anxiety, I decided to make a change. Two weeks ago, I sat myself down on the small couch in my apartment and made a plan. The first thoughts that entered my head as I began planning my new lifestyle consisted of the ambiguity of what a routine is defined as. There is not one perfectly balanced routine that one should follow, nor can one control every aspect of their life and make a routine out of it. Instead, I realized that I needed to develop a routine based off of the aspects in my life that are consistent and that I am able to control. Maybe this routine will not be quite as balanced and simple as it was in high school, but nonetheless, it is a routine.
I compiled a list of the things of which I felt in control and began incorporating them into my casual new routine. Although my classes begin at different times every day, I can control what time I wake up. My earliest class begins at 10:00, so I set a daily alarm for 9:00 on my phone. I can control what I eat and when I eat. This control of food can be sticky because sometimes people will take it out of hand. Personally, I like to eat three balanced meals a day. One in the morning, one in the afternoon, and one in the evening. Oh, and I like having a daily dessert. Another thing I can control is my fitness. Exercising reduces stress and releases endorphins. I made the goal to exercise around four days a week. Lastly, I decided that I needed to incorporate personal time into my routine each day. I make sure to give myself an hour of daily free time which usually consists of binging on my favorite television show or napping in bed.
Two weeks have gone by since I created this routine. Although I do not always follow it perfectly, having a sense of routine in my life has already had positive impacts on me. I feel less stressed, happy, and healthy. I encourage everyone to develop a routine for themselves. It is important for everyone to have a healthy sense of control over their life.

We’ve all heard the common cliche phrase “there’s no place like home,” but I have never felt the true sentimental value of being “home.” To me, my home is not defined by the physical space of my room or house, but rather the collective feelings of being with my friends, spending time at my favorite shops and restaurants, and looking outside to a familiar environment. 
I had never really felt the feeling of “home” until I went back to my home in Sunnyvale for the first time this past Thanksgiving break for two days. I grew up my entire life in Sunnyvale, a once suburban town turned into a city in the Bay Area. 
As my time in college and away from home passed, I found myself missing an essential part of my identity that has been with me up until now. I missed the availability of milk tea everywhere, walking the streets of downtown Mountain View late at night with friends, and hanging out in cars when there was absolutely nothing to do. 
My identity has always been associated with the Bay Area culture of startups, technology, prominent Asian culture, and even fashion trends. Although I enjoy exploring Los Angeles, I feel like a part of me has been left behind and compromised once I moved away for college.
We all know the feeling of appreciating something you once had once it’s gone, but we don’t REALLY know until we are truly separated from it. It’s different knowing that I can’t just go home whenever I want, and that the friends and places I grew up loving are not readily available to me. 
Even though I was only home for two days, I can honestly say that I have never enjoyed being in the Bay Area as much as I did those two days. It’s especially ironic because I used to always complain about not having anything to do and that my city is boring, but being away from that Silicon Valley bubble for a few months made me appreciate the place I call home. 
It’s a weird feeling: being home. The place feels familiar to you, yet new at the same time. Things change without you; New stores open, new houses are built, and everything looks different, yet still recognizable. You become excited to go places you became sick of. You see home with a new perspective. I felt like I was living a double life: one in the present and one in the past. 
Going home felt like I was meeting a long lost friend who I had not seen in over 20 years. But once reunited, you don’t feel like you were apart for so long anymore. Your relationship continues just like it used to be in the past. It’s like pressing play on a paused movie. 
Returning to the place where I have lived for almost 18 years was a refreshing experience that I would not trade for anything in the world. After all, I did pay for a one-hour flight to San Jose and back just to be home for two days. 
It’s interesting how a complete change in environment, even just for a couple of months, can completely change the perspective I once had for 18 years of my life. I think I can now say I know what home feels like. There really is no place like home.

Three tissue boxes and one large bowl of chicken noodle soup later, and I am finally sitting down to write this last article for the semester. It is safe to say that the four papers I had due back-to-back right after Thanksgiving did not give me much time to enjoy my food coma…or leftovers for that matter. Tragically, after making it through the entire semester illness-free, a cold has snatched my whole life this week of all weeks. 
To update anyone who is curious about the cliffhangers I ended with in my last article pre-Thanksgiving: My sister and Oregon’s volleyball team beat USC, my parents loved my man, and all in all, Thanksgiving surprisingly went on without any drama — well, major drama. I could tell you about an altercation that went down at In-N-Out involving my entire family, or about this fraud Uber experience my mom had, or about how I chopped off all of my hair, but in keeping with the holiday spirit I thought I would impart some more positive advice instead. 
Whether this is your first round of finals or your last, it is never an easy time of the year. I’ve never been someone who found herself in the library at early hours of the morning or someone who crammed; I think I am somewhere right in the middle of “Jesus, take the wheel” and “I should probably look over this study guide at least once.” So for anyone out there that either feels like they’re doing too much or not doing enough, the first thing I would tell you is to just take a deep breathe, maybe a big sip of coffee, and to remember that in the end, grades don’t define your life. 
That is, unless you’re trying to go to any type of graduate school…then you should probably be studying and not reading this. 
If you are celebrating any holidays that involve gift-giving this season, try not to let it turn you into the crazy person we all know from the infamous Black Friday videos. So often people forget the actual reason for the season. Holidays are not meant to be about “stuff.” Don’t get me wrong, they say you can’t buy happiness, but a new pair of shoes usually makes me pretty happy. But, remember that it’s about presence not presents. Sounds similar, but they’re very different. Enjoy the moments with family, friends, or even getting to sleep in a little longer over the break. Don’t take the home-cooked meals for granted. And most importantly, be thankful for everything else in between. While the holidays are usually a stressful time for many reasons, it is also a great time to remind yourself what is really important. 
New Year’s is full of resolutions that never see their fulfillment. I know I’ve been that person that says she is going to eat better, work out more, ready more books, and the list goes on. Set goals that are realistic and achievable, and then you’ll actually end up feeling accomplished. Rather than promising yourself you’ll climb Mount Kilimanjaro, maybe make it a point to take a hike with friends at least once next semester. Instead of going from being the burger queen to vegan in one foul swoop, tell yourself you’ll start trying healthy recipes once a week at home. Starting small usually creates the best habits and in no time, you’ll be checking off those to-do’s on your list for 2017. 
I personally am very much looking forward to the end of the semester. I’ll be turning 22, I’ll have one more semester at USC left, and hopefully, I’ll have beaten this cold (pray for me). But before any of us can turn in our final blue books of 2016, we have to survive these last couple of weeks. So with that, it’s back to studying and sippin’ some tea (literally…my throat is killing me). 
I’ll see you in 2017! New Year, New Me. Who Dis?
