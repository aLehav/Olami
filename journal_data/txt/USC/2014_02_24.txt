On Tuesday evening, Cambria Gordon, co-founder of Partnership to End Distracted Driving, spoke to graduate students in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. Adjunct professor Gary Wexler invited Gordon to his class on nonprofit advocacy because many students expressed concern regarding the issue of texting while driving.
Eyes on the road · Cambria Gordon speaks to students in the Annenberg School Monday night about the dangers of distracted driving. – Liliana Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
 
“During the first week of class, students had to write about a cause that they were interested in, and many of them wrote about this topic,” Wexler said.
Gordon’s personal story inspired her to educate others about the dangers of distracted driving. On July 20, 2011, she hit an elderly man in the crosswalk while retrieving her phone from the floor of her car. The man passed away soon after the incident, and Gordon struggled to cope with the emotional trauma of what she had done.
Gordon was charged with misdemeanor and vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence.
“Because I had the phone in my hand, it was a crime,” Gordon said. “And for the first time, I heard the words distracted driving, and I was a criminal.”
Gordon embarked upon an arduous road to forgiveness, filled with self-incrimination. She lived in fear and anxiety, managing her grief by distancing herself from reality.
“I could not believe that I had taken another person’s life,” Gordon said.
Gordon received 360 hours of court-ordered community service and 36 months of informal probation, which inspired her to move forward with a nonprofit.
“I had this epiphany that I’m just like everybody else in those orange vests and everyone is like me,” Gordon said. “I’m the mom of three who went to the Emmy Awards, but I’m also the homeless person who washes their hair in a sink at the beach. We all make mistakes, and I’m not perfect and I don’t have a perfect life. I came away with the idea that we are all imperfect.”
Gordon approached AT&T with her idea to create an educational documentary about distracted driving.
“We decided that we would work together and that I would be their Hollywood ambassador,” Gordon said. “I would go and have meetings with TV show runners and writers’ rooms and try to get the issue into scripted television.”
She concluded by encouraging students to pursue their ideas and use their life experiences to inspire positive change.
Jeri Lynch, a second featured speaker, followed Gordon’s speech by describing her own story. She founded the Conor Lynch Foundation in honor of her son Conor, who died from a distracted driving accident in 2010. Lynch’s organization informs high school students about the issue through different forms of media, such as short films and a mobile app.
Additionally, Lynch organized a run in celebration of Conor’s passion for track and field. The run attracted more than 1,000 participants and raised about $80,000.
“Spiritually, I decided I had to do something,” Lynch said.
In conclusion, Wexler emphasized that nonprofits must discover creative ways to reach the soul of society.
“We are in a world that has multiple ways of reaching people and getting messages across … but the most important thing is that you need to have a strong idea,” Wexler said.

The USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy and the Sol Price School of Public Policy collaborated on Wednesday morning to host the “Government and Leadership Conference: People Over Politics” symposium.
Terminate gridlock · Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger told students on Monday that the political system had “let [them] down.” – Kevin Fohrer | Daily TrojanMore than 100 students, faculty, staff and prominent guests, such as former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, gathered at the USC Town and Gown Ballroom for the event.  Panelists included former California State Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, his former Chief of Staff Susan Kennedy and Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough of MSNBC’s Morning Joe.
Terminate gridlock · Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger told students on Monday that the political system had “let [them] down.” – Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan
The conference, which consisted of two panel discussions and a research presentation, focused on the mounting issue of politicians catering to their political parties or personal agendas rather than representing their constituencies.
This theme, which was constant throughout the morning, reflected the views of the Schwarzenegger Institute itself.
“It is our core belief that our country is better when our officials put our interests above those of their political parties and political ideologies,” said Nancy Staudt, academic director of the institute.
Following a brief introduction, Schwarzenegger delivered opening remarks to the students in the room.
“Our political system has let you down,” he said. “When Congress has a 10 percent approval rating and 90 percent of them get re-elected, you know it is a broken and rigged system.”
He ended his remarks advising students to make an impact on the political system.
“What can you do? First,  get out and vote. Second, fight for what you believe in,” Schwarzenegger said.
The panelists continued into the first panel discussion entitled “Political Gridlock — Is There an End in Sight?” Moderated by Kennedy, this debate featured republicans Scarborough and Schwarzenegger going                   head-to-head with Brzezinski, a democrat.
Kennedy spared no time in asking difficult questions.
“Do you think gridlock is an aberration in our society, or is it just the way we do business?” Kennedy asked.
Even as the debate got heated, the mood remained light, with the panelists often telling jokes and teasing each other about their respective ideologies.
“I used to hate Bill Clinton — and he hated me too!” Scarborough said, reminiscing on his career as a Florida congressman.
“You should see them together now though,” Brzezinski said of her co-host and the former president Clinton, who she now has a very friendly and cordial relationship with.
After debating the nature of gridlock, the panelists took on the task of deciding whether it is productive or regressive for the nation.
“I think gridlock is necessary but for how long?” Schwarzenegger said.
“If you look at this country I think we’ve had enough.” Schwarzenegger continued to explain how he quickly and constructively used gridlock in California as political leverage in tackling issues such as pension reform.
The panelists reiterated the fact that paralyzing effects of gridlock on politicians and constituencies are just as dangerous as legislative stagnation itself.
“Nobody wants to be challenged anymore — everyone just wants to go into their corners,” Brzezinski said, adding that media bias contributes heavily to gridlock.
“We have a political system that encourages extremism and polarization,” Scarborough said. Scarborough also explained that refusal to compromise on Capitol Hill is often seen as a victory at home for congressmen.
Villaraigosa also commented on what needed to be done to enact change.
“Leaders in both parties need to be willing to challenge their own constituencies,” he said. The former mayor lamented the extreme polarization in both Congress and the nation at large.
All of the panelists agreed on the need for party leadership to ultimately put aside their career aspirations to address partisanship in the government.
The panel concluded with questions from students, who asked about topics ranging from the Tea Party to whether there actually was an end in sight to the gridlock.
“Courage wins,” Scarborough said, urging politicians to challenge the interests of hyper-factionalized constituencies in order to make cohesive change possible.

The Residential Student Government will be hosting a wide array of events this week as part of Awareness Week 2014. The program is designed to improve residential life for all students and will take place in each of the residential areas around campus.
The programs will be hosted at the North Area, South Area, West Area and Parkside Area and will focus on diversity, safety, health and wellness and stress relief.
Each day will focus on promoting one of the values of Awareness Week. Monday’s events highlighted diversity and took place in the North Area Courtyard and the Birnkrant Multipurpose Room. Students participated in salsa and zumba classes and ate ethnic cuisine including Korean, Italian and Mexican food.
There was also information about the Los Angeles Metro to encourage students to go out and explore the city. Taryn Maister, programming chair for North Residential College, emphasized how important it is for students to get off campus and see Los Angeles.
“I don’t think students realize how diverse Los Angeles is,” Maister said. “We got restaurants from around L.A. to give us ethnic food for Awareness Week to show students that they don’t only have to stay on campus to get good food. They should go out and explore the city.”
Safety will be the main focus of Tuesday’s events, which will take place on the South Area Lawn. Self-defense, bike safety and CPR classes will be offered to students and In-N-Out burgers will be served to those who participate.
Jack Huebner, a freshman majoring in cognitive science, hopes to work on the EMT Team at sporting events on campus next year and is utilizing Awareness Week to learn CPR.
“I’m excited for Tuesday, which will definitely help me prep for applying to work on the emergency response team at sporting events next year,” Huebner said.
Wednesday’s events move       off-campus to Cardinal Gardens where health and wellness will be the topic of interest. A basketball tournament is scheduled from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. and healthy smoothies, burgers and granola will be offered to fuel the players.
Friday will round up Awareness Week with events at Parkside geared towards helping students with stress relief. Puppies will be available for students to pet to relieve the anxiety of midterm season.
Tina Tzeng, vice president of programming for RSG, emphasized that the organization wants to focus on more than just the social aspect of dorm life.
“During fall semester, RSG holds a highlighter dance and ‘Save Tommy Night,’” Tzeng said. “Now in spring semester, we wanted to move away from just social life and move towards areas that we can highlight and improve in residential life as well.”
Tzeng hopes that Awareness Week will serve as a bonding experience for those in student housing.
“At RSG, we want to make dorms more than just a place to live, we want to make them a home,” Tzeng said. “Awareness Week gives everyone a break from studying and a chance to come and have some fun. If everyone has a smile on their face, the event was a success.”

On Monday, the Department of Public Safety announced it had apprehended a suspect in connection with a series of street scams near the University Park Campus.
At approximately 12:32 p.m., DPS received a complaint about a man trying to sell clothing near 28th Street and Figueroa Street. The car was described as a       dark-colored Jeep Cherokee that had allegedly been used in a previous attempt to defraud someone.
Officers responded and were searching for the suspect when they received a hit from a license plate recognition camera and arrested an Italian male who uses the name Pasquale Silvestro on the 2600 block of Monmouth Avenue, north of campus.
“We detained the suspect in that vehicle, and he was taken into custody for grand theft,” DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said. “We’re pleased this person has been taken into custody. It appears we have the right man and numerous articles of new clothing were recovered from his car.”
Last Friday, DPS alerted students of a scam artist claiming to be down on his luck and selling custom-made Italian suits out of the back of his vehicle. Officers suspected he was using different rental cars and entered various license plates into their system over the weekend.
Silvestro is suspected of taking large sums of money from at least three students while attempting to scam others. Carlisle said there might have been additional scam attempts that went unreported.
“There could be people who have not come forward who were defrauded by him, “ Carlisle said. “If they were, we would like them to contact DPS detectives.”
Though an initial incident report suggested there might have been a second female suspect, Silvestro was alone at the time of arrest. As of Monday night the suspect was in the process of being booked at LAPD.

Throughout his truly remarkable and incomparable coaching career, legendary USC baseball coach Rod Dedeaux amassed more than 1,300 wins and brought home 11 national championships, figures that led to him being named the Coach of the 20th Century by Baseball America in 1999.
Dedeaux coached dozens of future Major Leaguers, and the Trojans’ baseball program, despite its recent struggles, remains by far the most accomplished program in NCAA history, which makes it all the more puzzling that it took the USC Athletic Department so long to build a statue of Dedeaux in front of the aptly-named Dedeaux Field.
Call it a coincidence or call it good karma, but since the statue’s first appearance, something special has been going on for the boys in cardinal and gold.
On Sunday, redshirt junior outfielder Omar Cotto Lozada hit a three-run home run in the 12th inning that capped a miraculous 10-day run in which the Trojans have started the season 7-0. The team’s unbeaten streak has seen four walk-off wins, three extra-inning games and a victory over national powerhouse Cal State Fullerton, which was ranked No. 2 before USC’s 6-1 win on Feb. 18.
What’s been more impressive than the team’s penchant for late-game heroics is the way in which USC’s pitching has kept it in games. Last season’s bullpen situation became so dire that head coach Dan Hubbs’ decision-making process on which arm to turn to boiled down to little more than flipping a coin. In the early goings of 2014, however, USC has a team ERA of 1.95, compared to last season’s unimpressive mark of 4.81.
Furthermore opposing batters are hitting just .224 and posting a .314 on-base percentage with a .270 slugging percentage against Trojan pitching this season. Last year, opponents hit .294/.388/.392 against USC’s pitchers. The Trojans have yet to give up a home run this year.
The calendar has yet to hit March, but it’s hard not to get even a little bit excited after the program’s first 7-0 start to a season since … well, 2012. Yes, the Trojans’ hot start then faded into obscurity, with the team posting a 23-32 overall record and a 8-22 Pac-12 record, but that doesn’t mean that there is no reason to get excited about this current group.
The majority of last season’s core returns this year, led by starting pitchers junior Wyatt Strahan, senior Bob Wheatley and sophomore Kyle Twomey, who have combined to throw 35.2 innings in six starts this year with an ERA of 2.85. USC’s four most oft-used relief pitchers — sophomore Sean Adler, junior Nigel Nootbaar, freshman Jeff Paschke and senior James Guillen — have allowed just one earned run in 21 innings pitched with a WHIP of 0.81 and an opponents’ batting average of .130.
On the offensive side, USC currently has five starters hitting .324 or better, including freshman catcher Jeremy Martinez, who is tied for the team lead with 11 hits. But of the four returning players currently hitting above .300, none of them hit better than .250 last year, which, combined with the abnormally high amount of close victories, begs the question — is any of this success sustainable?
My answer to that would be probably not, but at this point, who cares? This once-proud program has had little to cheer for during the 21st Century, and a large portion of the undergraduate enrollment can count the number of baseball games they’ve been to on one hand.
If there was ever a season to become a USC baseball fan, this just might be the one. Dedeaux Field is a great place to take in a game, and the university revamped its concessions this season and started selling alcohol during games. The home schedule features plenty of quality opponents, including nationally ranked foes Cal Poly, UCLA and Oregon State. These games should provide the Trojans with a chance to prove whether or not their early success is legitimate.
Maybe this 7-0 start is all just one long hot streak. USC plays away from Dedeaux Field tonight for the first time all season against Long Beach State, then returns home to face Cal Poly. That stretch could knock the Trojans back to reality.
But maybe this 7-0 start is something more, like a young team finally figuring it out after taking its lumps a season ago. Maybe 2014 will end up being the year marking USC’s triumphant return. Perhaps Dedeaux’s statue came at the right time — when the program was finally ready to reclaim some of its past glory.

USC is 7-0.  Everyone hop on the baseball bandwagon!

Unusual weather did not lead to unusual results for the USC women’s golf team, which finished nearly two rounds of action at the rain-shortened Allstate Sugar Bowl Intercollegiate in second place.

The No. 1 Women of Troy were knotted up with No. 2 UCLA after the day’s first 18 holes, two strokes behind No. 14 Florida, the round leader. The remaining 18 holes were a slightly different story, however, as the Bruins surged ahead with a remarkable score of 11-under par. USC, with a combined score of 10-under, currently sits four strokes behind their crosstown rival going into today’s final round. Though the team certainly still has a chance to add to its school-record win streak, it will also have to fend off the always-dangerous Gators. Florida remains six strokes behind the Women of Troy while No. 6 Alabama and No. 3 Oklahoma State rounded out the top five.
USC head coach Andrea Gaston was impressed by the Bruins’ strong start in the second round, but knew her team had the talent to close the gap.
“UCLA started to separate themselves,” Gaston said. “I knew we still had plenty of golf left, and we just needed to take it one shot at a time.”
Senior Sophia Popov led the way on the individual side for the Women of Troy, firing a 5-under 67 over her first 18 holes. Though Popov followed that score in the day’s second half with a less impressive 2-over 74, her combined two-round score of 3-under was good enough for a sixth-place tie. Five strokes ahead of Popov on top of the individual leaderboard is the surprising Erynne Lee of UCLA, who shot a blistering 6-under 66 during the second round to put her at 7-under for the day. The junior came into the tournament as the Bruins’ fourth seed. Tied for the individual lead is Tonje Daffinrud of Denver.
USC also got solid performances from sophomore standouts Annie Park and Kyung Kim. Park rebounded from a 1-over 73 with a second-round 3-under, good enough to put her in a ninth-place tie just one stroke behind her teammate Popov. Kim was a model of consistency throughout the long day, stringing together scores of one-under and even par. The Chandler, Ariz. native is tied for 12th place, six strokes behind the leader.
Freshman Karen Chung was USC’s final qualifier, combining for an even-par effort over two rounds. Chung bounced back nicely from a disappointing first round 2-over to get back to even.
Gaston thought her players gave a worthy effort in the face of fatigue and difficult weather conditions.
“Our players did a great job,” Gaston said. “They made some clutch birdies down the stretch.”
If last year’s Allstate Sugar Bowl is any indication, the Women of Troy have an excellent chance at a comeback victory. The eventual national champions fell to sixth place after the event’s first round, but rallied over the final 36 holes to claim the tournament championship.
The 2013 event, also held at English Turn C.C. in New Orleans, had similar weather concerns: Participating teams played their final two rounds on the same day. USC will be seeking its ninth straight victory, and sixth consecutive win to begin the 2013-2014 campaign. The team has won 11 of its last 12 events.
Still, Gaston knows victory is anything but a sure thing for her team.
“It was a long day,” she said. “With a strong finish, we now have a chance to catch [UCLA] tomorrow.”
Final-round action begins bright and early at 8 a.m. EST this morning, and action can be followed live at golfstat.com.

The last time the Women of Troy found themselves in an overtime thriller, Anni Espar netted her second goal of the game to secure the Women of Troy the 2013 NCAA National Championship title in a triple-overtime sudden death extravaganza against Stanford. And though the national title wasn’t on the line Sunday evening, USC’s chances of defending its UCI Invitational crown — and bragging rights — were.
Take the lead · Senior two-meter Colleen O’Donnell scored six goals throughout the four games of the UCI Invitational, including two goals in the championship game against UCLA, which put USC ahead 5-3. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Standing in the way of retaining that title was crosstown rival No. 3 UCLA.
After demolishing Cal State Bakersfield 21-1 in the opening round of the tournament Saturday morning behind a combined five-goal effort by the Haralabidis twins —  freshmen drivers Ioanna (3) and Stephania (2) — the Women of Troy found themselves in a rematch with No. 10 Cal State Northridge.
In USC’s first meeting with the Matadors earlier this month, senior goalie Flora Bolonyai tallied 10 saves during a spectacular performance that led to the sixth shutout in program history in a 13-0 victory. Even though the Matadors were able to find their way onto the scoreboard this time, Bolonyai repeated with another stellar outing, recording 12 saves in just three periods of work as USC earned a 12-5 triumph.
A strong Saturday in the pool earned the Women of Troy a spot in the semifinals, where they faced No. 4 California Sunday morning.
Jumping out to a quick first period 4-1 lead, the Trojans never allowed the Golden Bears to gather any momentum. USC entered intermission with a 6-3 advantage and gave up no ground in the second half.
Stephania Haralabidis — who logged her first career four-goal game — continued her offensive prowess as she scored four goals in USC’s 12-7 victory over Cal. On Monday, she was named the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Newcomer of the Week after leading the Women of Troy with 10 goals throughout the four-game tournament.
“Stephania was excellent against Cal,” said 12-time National Coach of the Year Jovan Vavic. “She is a young player, but this girl is going to be an Olympian for sure. When she gets more comfortable in our system and starts playing more [freely], without too much thinking, she is going to be an unbelievable player.”
After UCLA stunned No. 2 Stanford by registering a 9-6 sweep of the Cardinal in the other semifinal matchup, the stage was set for a dramatic finish.
The Women of Troy entered the game with an unblemished record of 11-0, largely thanks to incredible offensive production throughout the season so far. But the dynamic Bruin play style turned the championship game into a defensive battle.
The Blue and Gold got on the board first, gaining a 2-0 lead before senior two-meter Madeline Rosenthal ripped one in to close out the first period, number 15 of the young season for the Miami native.
In the second half, senior two-meter Colleen O’Donnell propelled USC to a 5-3 lead with back-to-back scores of her own.
As time was winding down in the fourth period, the determined Bruins cut into the lead with just under two minutes to play. As Trojan fans began to celebrate, UCLA plugged in another goal with just five seconds remaining in regulation to even the score and force overtime.
“It was disappointing for us to have a two-goal lead with just a couple minutes to go and let them get back into it,” Vavic said. “We relaxed. We got the lead, and we stopped attacking. We made some defensive errors, and we just didn’t finish the game when we had a chance to do so.”
With momentum in their favor, the Bruins continued their scoring streak — recording the lone goal in the first period of overtime to take a 6-5 lead. But this would not last long.
In the second period, junior two-meter Eike Daube was determined to keep the undefeated season alive. Just 42 seconds in, Daube rocketed a shot across the goal, which found its way into the net to even the score. Daube’s day was not finished there.
Just after the U.S. Junior National Team member tied it up, Daube tacked on another one with a skip shot to pull the Women of Troy ahead, 7-6. Terrific Trojan defense followed, giving USC the title of UCI Invitational champions once again.
“Eike came through in the second overtime, and this is her best overall performance as a Trojan,” Vavic said. “Whenever there is a little bit of adversity, it’s great to see someone like Eike step up.”
Daube’s stellar play throughout the tournament, which included three goals against Cal in the semifinals in addition to her late heroics against UCLA, earned the title of MPSF Player of the Week.
The tournament was USC’s first tough competition of the year and Vavic treated it as a great learning experience.
“I learned that we are really tough,” Vavic said. “We stayed together when we were challenged. We are going to be a tough team to beat this year.”
Next up for the Women of Troy is a trip to Tempe, Ariz., where USC will face Arizona State in its first MPSF event of the season.

Students, faculty and film industry professionals gathered in the Radisson Ballroom last Sunday for the grand finale of the Southern California Business Film Festival. The Competitive Event was the culmination of a week-long celebration of cinematic storytelling and the industry behind it. SCBFF, both the name of festival and the student team that makes it all happen, treated the USC community to a semi-formal lunch and 11 thought-provoking and laughter-inducing student films throughout the week.
SCBFF has been bringing together the cornerstones of the film industry — innovation and creativity — since 2007, with the support of the Marshall School of Business. The events were open to all types students, however, not just those in Marshall and the School of Cinematic Arts. One of the goals of the festival is to give the rest of the school a taste of what the USC film students are really working on.
This year, the events included the Smartphone Film Festival on Feb. 9 and the Creative Development Panel on Feb. 18. The Competitive Event required student filmmakers to submit their work in advance, but other than that there were only two submission requirements: the movie had to be 25 minutes or shorter and produced after March 2013. The panel of judges included Evan Daugherty, screenwriter of Snow White and the Huntsman; Michael Renov, professor of critical studies and vice dean of Academic Affairs; Jon M. Chu, director of Step Up 2, Step Up 3-D and G.I. Joe: Retaliation, and Aaron Godfred, director of John Dies at the End, starring Paul Giamatti and Clancy Brown.
The Competitive Event featured the distinguished keynote speaker, Professor Jason E. Squire, who teaches film business and screenwriting. He spoke about his current research on DIY filmmaking, a model that is gaining traction in the industry and is also an accessible way for students to make movies.
Squire began the dialogue by stepping off the podium to ask the audience, “How many people have seen The Lego Movie?” Speaking to the different generations of the audience in the room, Squire explained the success of The Lego Movie. His new focus is this “potential emerging business model,” the process of making and distributing movies under the radar. Our society is entangled in systems of entertainment: live theatre, games, web series, even televised sports such the Olympics, where the cycles of business are converging.
“This is an area of entertainment where you don’t know where it is going to end up” Squire concluded. As the SCBFF Smartphone Contest demonstrates, DIY filmmaking enables auteurs to go out, create a piece and upload it immediately.
To make the festival happen, each member of the small SCBFF team had many responsibilities. As SCBFF Co-Director of Competitive Event Augusto Vighy, a freshman in the World Bachelor’s for Business program said, “every single detail counts.” The team was responsible for tasks that were as major as renting the ballroom to as minor as the flower arrangements. The SCBFF team has been streamlined over the years, shrinking from 60 members to around 30 since it’s inception. The small group is passionate about each other and what they are doing, however.
“We were excited to have them, to have their dream and their vision come to fruition,” said Austin Mora, co-executive director of SCBFF.
On Sunday, screenings began with Sheltered Love, a tongue-in-cheek love story set in 1950s suburbia, which won Best Production Design. It was followed by You and Me, the story of a nerd turned voyeur, filmed in Hong Kong.
Though it was not as accessible to audiences, it was Vighy’s favorite film, and he confessed that, “I fought for that film to be showed … because it was different from the others. That’s what I want to find in films, something that makes me feel an emotion and that stands out from the crowd.”
Co-Executive Director Leora Weinstock said her favorite film was Cherry Pop, which received the award for Best Actor. Directed by Assaad Yacoub, the film was a behind-the-scenes glimpse at a night in the life of eight drag queens. Yacoub, who was born and raised in Dubai, had never met a drag queen until he came to the United States to study film. Cherry Pop was his thesis.
“I know eight drag queens, but I know 16 different people, because they’re different as boys, and they’re different as girls,” Yacoub said.
Through the process, Yacoub said he learned the drama and the fun of working with drag queens.
“They’re all all actors. They’re very natural comedians,” Yacoub said
Similar to Cherry Pop, SCBFF celebrates two split personalities, but those of film and the other side of the curtain — both the business and creative sides of entertainment. The group celebrated this by giving out both awards for the professionals in front of the screen, such as Best Actress, which went to Mellie Nolen for Curtains, an exploration of the line between art and reality. Momentum received Best Editing.
This year’s festival was characterized by diversity and variety. The film Marcel, the story of thieves fighting to steal a mustache, was a big winner, sweeping Best Picture and Best Director. So was Hotel Vernonia, a surrealist psychological thriller, which received Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography and Best Sound.
As the festival was winding down, the audience applauded the caliber of the submissions to the festival.
“It’s been a little bit of a rocky start … but our festival has gone very well this year,” Mora said.

For as long as I can remember, my mom has brewed a big pot of coffee when she wakes up. I can trace my own education in coffee by the way that process has evolved over the years, from the type of coffee to the machine used to brew it.
At first, it was Folgers coffee and French Vanilla Coffee-Mate. When my dad started working for The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, the choices expanded. From Folgers “Classic Roast,” we slowly but surely made the move to a place where words like “light and subtle” began to mean something different from “light and distinctive.”  What hasn’t changed over the years is my mom’s ritual use of French Vanilla Coffee-Mate. She knows now it dilutes the flavor of the beans, but she enjoys it all the same. What can I say? It’s her way.
It was through The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf that I began to see coffee not just as a tool for survival (zero period band class is no laughing matter), but as a culture and a community in Los Angeles.
That idea was reinforced when I attended my first barista competition in 2011, the Southwest Regional Barista Competition. The competition, held at Siren Studios, a too-cool-for-school space in Hollywood, Calif., introduced me to the skill, passion and facial hair that populates this small, but growing subculture.
For those who don’t know — I sure didn’t — barista competitions are a platform for professional baristas to face off through short, timed presentations where they are judged on their presentation, preparation and creativity in making a  cappuccino, espresso and a signature beverage.
Last weekend, I checked out the Big Western Regional Barista Competition, which moved to the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles this year by two major coffee houses, Handsome Coffee Roasters and Stumptown Coffee.
The competition was held in Lot 613, a converted warehouse in the Arts District. It was a 15-minute drive from USC, and the street I parked on was interesting in its own right, offset by street art by ROA, one of the biggest names in street art at the moment.
The audience at the event was mostly 20-somethings, many wearing denim or plaid. There were plenty of tattoos among the attendees. Most of the men sported facial hair. Among all, a passion for coffee was evident on their faces.
The three-day competition, which is free and open to the public, did feel underground in a way. But, as one of the audience members said, though the coffee community is small, it has grown. For example, she said that it’s becoming easier to call herself a professional barista, without having to launch into an extensive explanation.
I’ll be the first to say that I don’t understand the technical details of much of what I was watching. Still it was cool to see the creativity and energy going into the presentations. One of the baristas who commanded attention when I was there on Saturday was Truman Severson of Portola Coffee Lab, who served his espresso to the judges with a mist of essences such as pineapple.
Though places like Seattle or San Francisco seem ubiquitous for breeding small coffeeshops, walking around the event and talking to local baristas and coffee enthusiasts just reinforced how Los Angeles has its own distinctive and growing coffee culture. From Silver Lake to Koreatown, baristas around the city are building names for themselves and their craft.
The United States Barista Championship takes top scorers from three regions to compete in the national event. The winner then qualifies to compete in the World Barista Championship. Notably, Los Angeles-area baristas took the top three slots this year. Charles Babinski of G & B Coffee finished first, Eden-Marie Abramowicz of Intelligentsia Coffee finished second and Frank La of Copa Vida rounded out the top three.
As I heard one person say during the event, “Viva el café!”

From the Roski School of Fine Arts to the Keck School of Medicine of USC, it’s no secret that USC is replete with incredibly talented individuals. In keeping with this tradition, the Thornton School of Music has consistently managed to foster excellence in students for generations. The popular music program, one of the school’s most recent successes, is no exception. At only four years old, the program has held class with the likes of famed Jay Z producer Young Guru, been featured in numerous local and national publications and even performed with The Beach Boys. Even with this impressive resumé, however, the school’s greatest triumph is its students. Twenty-year-old sophomore Katie Stump, one of the shining lights of the program, is proving exactly why the popular music major deserves its highly lauded reputation.

On Friday, Feb. 28, Stump will be headlining a special show at Tommy’s Place to celebrate the release of her latest record, Puzzle Pieces. A California native, Stump lets the SoCal spirit thrive in all of her music. Her laid-back, sun-soaked musical style fits in perfectly with the USC atmosphere and one wouldn’t be surprised to hear her tunes blaring from a boombox on Venice Beach.
“I like to think of my sound as a combination of pop and country singer-songwriter music, with a hint of folk mixed in,” Stump said.
In keeping with this style, fans of Taylor Swift or Colbie Caillat will instantly recognize the bubbly guitars, light drums and empowering themes. Anyone at the show can expect to tap his or her foot along to songs about love, loss and seizing the day.
“Lyrically I enjoy drawing from honest experiences, good and bad, that I or the people around me are going through,” Stump said. “This album in particular has a lot of positive, motivational messages throughout, which I also really enjoy sharing with my listeners.”
With songs such as “Today” and “Chasing Summer,” Stump shows her lighter side. After a long winter, warm themes of spring and summer are definitely welcome. That said, she isn’t afraid to delve into more emotional material, and Stump shows her maturity as a writer on tracks like “I Told You So” and “Stay.” Even though Katie might seem sweet on the surface, she’s definitely not your average pop star in the making. Incredible prowess on the guitar as well as a knockout voice make her tastefully simple songs come alive.
“I have been working on these songs for a long time, so it would mean the world to me to see them enjoyed by the audience,” Stump said. “I also hope to strengthen my connection with my fans as well as make some new ones.”
For anyone who has seen her play before, Stump’s dedication to her music and fans is clear. Though compelling on her own, Stump will be backed by a band of fellow Thornton students Devon Eisenbarger, Leila Milki, Mike Harper and Livia Slingerland. With incredible songs and this fantastic lineup, it will be hard for anyone to come away from the show without wanting to find out more about this up-and-coming artist.
Friday’s show starts at 7:30 p.m. at Tommy’s Place, with singer-songwriter Meg De Lacy followed by popular music student Max Quilici. Stump will take the stage and start her 45-minute set of all original material at 9 p.m. For those interested in finding out more about Stump, visit katiestump.com or search for her on iTunes. Physical copies of Puzzle Pieces will also be available at the show.

The new eponymous LP followed the 2011 album Strange Mercy, a lyrically emotional outpouring on Clark’s behalf, featuring a prominent string section mingling with Clark’s own lilting voice. In 2012, she collaborated with Talking Heads’ David Byrne on their off-the-wall album, Love This Giant, which was punctuated throughout by bold trumpet tones. Indeed, that album’s strong influence carried over onto St. Vincent, as evident by the growing presence of heavy brass sounds in addition to the usual arrangement of heavenly strings found on previous albums.
In the meantime, Clark has kept quite busy. She partnered up with Rookie, an alternative teen weblog spearheaded by wunderkind Tavi Gevinson, to make an instructional video on how to execute a “rainbow” soccer kick. She also made television cameos in the quirky IFC sketch comedy show Portlandia, the CW series Gossip Girl  and the Fox cartoon Bob’s Burgers (where an animated revison of herself performed an original song called “Bad Girls”). Needless to say, Clark’s eccentric personal endeavors besides making music paint a unique portrait of the curious personality and childlike spirit of her album, as well as her well-established fan base.
The songstress had previously released two singles since December of 2013, building up hype for the album to come. The lead single “Birth in Reverse” makes use of distorted guitar riffs and an oscillating bassline, melding into an indie-pop-art-punk amalgam fit for an energetic dance floor. “Digital Witness,” the second single, invites in horns that craft a funky shoulder-shimmying beat as Clark croons, “I want all of your mind.” The song also doubles as a snarky criticism of social media and technology addiction. She warns to “get back” in the lyrics; Clark elaborates, “What’s the point of even sleeping / If I can’t show it, if you can’t see me / What’s the point of doing anything?” These two musical gems served as a foreshadowing for the album as a whole, of which the vast stylistic developments do not disappoint in the slightest.
Albeit clocking in at just over 40 minutes, St. Vincent is a masterful album strategically put together to reflect each song’s strengths. Clark shows off her singing chops on tracks like “Rattlesnake,” where her vocal register wavers like that of a psychedelic, modern-day George Formby. The track “Regret,” interspersed with hefty guitar licks, is a testament to Clark’s exquisite lyricism, in which she sings, “I’m afraid of heaven because I can’t stand the heights / I’m afraid of you because I can’t be left behind.”
Undoubtedly, the new record sees Clark experimenting with some new styles. On the gritty song “Bring Me Your Loves,” she chants in an almost tribal-like vocoder over a steady marching drum beat and extraterrestrial sliding guitar tones. Though a departure from her typical delicate, celestial sound, the song does its job in demonstrating Clark’s versatility and skill.
Though the majority of the album consists of up-tempo, synth-driven tracks, the song “I Prefer Your Love” loyally gleans some of the slow ballad sound that permeated St. Vincent’s last album, Strange Mercy. One of the outstanding songs on the album, “Huey Newton” is also reminiscent of Clark’s enchanting gospel-meets-cabaret sound that was omnipresent on the last album. She builds up to the high-hitting climax, singing the lyrics, “So Hale-Bopp / Hail Mary / hail Hagia Sophia / Oh it was a lonely, lonely winter,” only to wrap up in a flurried denouement full of crunchy guitar and bass -— the element that grounds the song firmly in the new sound of St. Vincent, and affirms Clark’s newfound gritty tenacity.
As the guitars get fuzzier and the drums hit harder throughout St. Vincent, Clark retains her plucky character manifested in her unparalleled voice — soft but strong, lofty but well-founded, feminine yet rough — making this record one of her best. The skillful fusion of genres and instrumentation presented in this album, cementing St. Vincent’s role as a force to be reckoned with, is a task few can pull off. It is safe to say St. Vincent can hold her own in the male-dominated music industry, even if it comes down to a no-holds-barred fistfight.
St. Vincent, with its volatile riffs and blitzkrieg rhythms, should definitely be considered fair warning.

For some, Valentine’s Day means flowers, chocolate and a dinner-date with a significant other.
This was not the case for me, though I did partake in the purchase of some on-sale chocolate the next day. On Singles Awareness Day, I binge-watched the new second season of House of Cards, which Netflix released on Feb. 14. For those unfamiliar with the show, it’s about ruthless politician Francis “Frank” Underwood who seeks a spot in the executive cabinet but ends up losing his desired position to someone else. He hatches a plan to ultimately reach his goal. Immersing myself into the world of Frank is truly addicting: I find myself constantly trying to guess which character he is going to psychologically bulldoze next. This show truly unveils the dimensionality of political figures, cunning sides and all.
It’s no surprise that many find House of Cards extremely entertaining. Lately, I have also added Homeland, Scandal and Veep to my extensive list of television shows to follow (House of Cards is just the crème de la crème because it allows me to conveniently watch it all in one sitting). Capitol Hill is often shrouded in mystery, so I find it interesting to see how politicians deal with international and interpersonal relationships, even if it is just fiction. Almost instantly after delving into the world of pretend politics, politicians became less of the intimidating, suit-and-tie figures I had always pictured in my mind. Instead, I began to sympathize with them for entering such a cutthroat atmosphere.
Perhaps that is why, upon further analysis of my newly treasured shows, I can find them a bit agitating. House of Cards showcases a particular politician hatching an elaborate and malicious plan to achieve his ultimate goal. Homeland’s Nicholas Brody has to decide between what he has been conditioned to do and his conscience. Scandal and Veep boast politicians trying to reach their potential, but sometimes their hubris or insecurities get in the way of their decisions. Most of the public read these storylines as a trend to get away from the former West Wing glory, where the government is heralded for its dauntless acts. Additionally, in a society where the word “politician” is negatively connoted and could be synonymous with “liar,” people attribute these new shows to that mindset.
The critical reception after House of Cards’ second season release was positive, averaging 87 percent approval on Rotten Tomatoes. But the foundation of this affirmation is due to the parallelism between the public viewing politicians as nefarious creatures and appropriating the portrayal as that. Politicians suffer from the same issues as their constituents, such as substance abuse or marital affairs, but that should not harm anyone’s perception of them. Yes, it propels me to judge their character, and I too agree that these downfalls are not anything of which to be proud. I do, however, feel as if judging someone’s ability to serve and lead based on one event is a logical fallacy.
I can, unfortunately, think of countless examples of when people jumped to conclusions and publicly shamed politicians for their actions, attributing their slip-ups to how they lead. I was not old enough to comprehend what was happening during the scandal between then- President Bill Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky, but I can still remember the cacophony of news reports during that time. It seems like, now thinking back on it, people forgot about his economic reform policies or the other good he did for the nation. Later on, when I started high school, the same thing happened to former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer after he cavorted with a prostitute. Many hurled insults at him, but it was at that time that I realized that diabolical acts don’t mean that the people are diabolical or, more importantly, that society will ultimately become a diabolical sphere because of one action.
It’s almost as if, in this case, art not only imitates life but also skews it as well. In the case of these shows, storylines dramatize the gravity of a certain situation and brand people as protagonist or antagonist to create tension. But as we work to create more realistic fiction, fictional reality arises.
Reports from the Huffington Post call this “cynical conformity.” In The West Wing, politicians sacrifice for their ideals to make way into legislation. House of Cards, however, sees politicians exercising social Darwinism for personal advancement. This movement of distrusting the figures shaping our country in the media causes people to in turn make rash judgments about people based on one event.
Nevertheless, House of Cards remains one of my favorite shows. There are faults to the logic it presents — but in the words of one wise Miley Cyrus during her Hannah Montana days, “Everyone makes mistakes / everyone has those days.” No one is perfect, and politicians are no exception.

Let’s face it: No one wants to get divorced. It’s complicated and messy.
Design by Mollie Berg
 
Yet that hasn’t stopped Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper from attempting to do just that to California. If his proposal to split California into six separate states can reach 807,615 signatures by July 14, the decision will be placed on the ballot in November, according to Time. Though California Sec. of State Debra Bowen announced that Draper could start collecting signatures for the plan, such a ridiculous proposal underestimates the difficulty behind taking on the endeavor of adding five states to the Union.
Calling California’s current state “ungovernable,” according to Time, Draper’s proposal would essentially solve the problem through the division of the state into six new governments. Under Draper’s proposal, California would be broken up into six individual states: Central California, Jefferson, North California, Silicon Valley, South California and West California. San Diego and Orange County would merge to create South California. Los Angeles would join Santa Barbara and claim the southern coast to form West California. Central California would consist of the vast farm area near Bakersfield and Fresno. The tech giants in San Francisco and San Jose would come together to form the aptly named Silicon Valley. The remaining two states would split the northern part of California into North California and Jefferson.
Draper argues that such a solution would alleviate California’s governing issues over such a large state, but the separation of the state into six new ones would also cause new issues entirely. Though splitting up the state would allow the more regional governments to better focus on the concerns of the individual area, more focus on individual constituents wouldn’t necessarily translate to easier governance. For example, the state would have to individually deal with how to respond to the statewide water crisis. Californians can already foresee difficulty allocating limited resources between one state under one government, let alone solving it under six.
What’s more, splitting California would only create more economic disparity. Silicon Valley would have the highest per-capita income in the United States, while Central California would become the poorest state in the country. Silicon Valley alone would become independent from the less economically productive regions of California, taking with it all of the state’s wealthy tech industry,an industry that would no longer have to deal with outside problems such as a poor education system or inferior state-funded infrastructure.
Furthermore, the formation of six states wouldn’t just require federal approval — which is nearly impossible to get — but it would also call for the elections of new congressional representatives to represent the newly formed states in Washington, D.C.
This isn’t the first time someone has called for a split of the Golden State. There was a bill to split California into two states in 1859, but Congress barred its passage due to the Civil War. In October, tech entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan called for the secession of California from the union, arguing that the Silicon Valley needed to be relieved of governmental constraints on technology.
Such attempts, similar to the petition last January for Texas to secede from the union, have come and failed. This petition is no different.

The USC men’s tennis team dominated the court this past Friday at Marks Stadium in a doubleheader match against UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara.
“A doubleheader is important for our team,” junior Roberto Quiroz said. “It’s great because it gives us more practice and the more practice, the better we play.”
Coming off of their second-place finish at the Houston ITA National Team Indoor Championships last weekend, the now-No. 2 Trojans added another duo of shutouts to make their 9-1 record of the season.
“It was definitely different going back to play outside after being indoors,” Quiroz said, “but it’s still not clay or anything, so it’s not bad.”
Indoors or not, this doubleheader proved to give the Trojans the practice they needed. In the first morning matchup against UC Davis, the Trojans first took down the Aggies in doubles play. Freshman Nick Crystal and junior Jonny Wang sealed an 8-1 victory on court three, while sophomore Max de Vroome and junior Eric Johnson secured an 8-5 win on court two. The match against UC Davis also marked Crystal’s first dual-match victory as a Trojan. He was able to bring USC up 3-0 early on in the match against the Aggies.
“It was really great finally getting to play,” Crystal said. “It was the first real game I’ve played.”
The match continued to the singles round where another ‘SC freshman — Rob Bellamy ­— was able to check off his own first dual-match win of the season, defeating Aggie Parker Kelley with a 6-2, 6-2 win. Winning became a universal affair for all of the Trojans on the team. At the No. 1 spot, Quiroz led the pack 6-1, 6-2. Freshman Connor Farren and de Vroome wrapped up the Trojans victory win a 7-0 finish.
“The culture Coach creates for us is really strong and makes it something great to play in,” freshman David Laser said. “He didn’t put any extra pressure on this game, actually, he made it more relaxed. We all got to play, and coach really made sure that happened.”
In the second half of the weekend’s doubleheader, junior Yannick Hanfmann and senior Ray Sarmiento captured the first doubles win against UC Santa Barbara, and the de Vroome/Johnson duo followed with another win, bringing the Trojans up 1-0.
In singles play, everyone came back ready to take on the Gauchos. Bellamy, de Vroome and Johnson earned their second wins of the day in the singles category. Trojans Hanfmann, Sarmiento and Wang secured wins of their own against Santa Barbara, to help the USC to a 7-0 victory over Santa Barbara for the afternoon’s matchup. Hanfmann captured a 6-0, 6-1 finish in the No. 1 line, while Sarmiento and Wang garnered a 6-1, 7-6 and 6-0, 6-0 finish in the No. 2 and No. 3 lines, respectively.
The younger members of the team were appreciative of the day’s matchups and for one another on the court.
“Captain Ray [Sarmiento] is great. He’s a great guy and [is] always looking out for us,” Laser said. “Roberto works really hard, and it’s great to see him get the recognition he deserves. He’s someone to look up to.”
The season is still young for the Trojans, and Quiroz knows that more opportunities for improvement have yet to come.
“I’m just working on staying consistent and trying to make myself better each time,” Quiroz said. “Winning Pac-12 has proven that hard work pays off, and it just makes me want to continue what I’m doing.”
The 9-1 Trojans move on to face crosstown rival UCLA after defeating them in the ITA National Indoors one weeks ago. USC will head to Westwood to face the Bruins in a Pac-12 matchup on Tuesday, Feb. 25 at noon.
