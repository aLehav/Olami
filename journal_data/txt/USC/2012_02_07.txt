Several artists showed videos and  performed Tuesday at the Witness and Responsibility conference to explore artists’ responses to Holocaust testimonies and to create new, informative art.
Testimony · Stephen Smith, director of the USC Shoah Institute, spoke about art and history at the Association of Jewish Theatres conference. - Emily Tat | Daily Trojan
The event, sponsored by the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, was part of the Association for Jewish Theatre’s four-day international conference, Reflecting and Shaping a Shifting World.
Shony Braun, a Holocaust survivor, played a violin emphatically in a short video clip.
He had previously played the song years before, when a Dachau officer threatened to kill him with a metal rod inches from his head if he did not play a song. He had never played this particular song, but he had pried a violin from the hands of a fallen prisoner and proceeded to play famous classical piece “The Blue Danube.”
Braun’s powerful testimony is one of nearly 52,000 acquired and archived by the Shoah Foundation, according to Stephen Smith, director of USC Shoah.
“These survivors have a very real, conscious sense of what their story could mean,” Smith said. “The question that lingers is that of history versus story: How do we become tellers?”
Stacie Chaiken, an adjunct faculty member at the USC School of Theatre, said she spent months poring over USC Shoah’s 105,000 hours of written and video-taped testimonies from Holocaust survivors before writing her performance piece titled “Next Year in Jerusalem.”
“We have the opportunity as artists to help shape perception,” Chaiken said. “We want to process this information and bring forth something that can shed light, can transform perception. Art’s role is to transform history into something that can change someone’s connection to that material.”
Comedian Betsy Salkind said humor can play a pivotal role in conveying difficult themes. Though she is aware there is always the potential for upsetting portions of her crowd when she presents delicate material in a lighthearted manner, Salkind said that is one of the purposes of comedy.
“I like the comedic approach,” Salkind said. “It allows [artists] to talk about things that must otherwise be really upsetting,” Salkind said. “A comedian’s role is to take problems and show [audiences] these faults.”
There is often the misconception that Holocaust survivors have been silent about their experiences during World War II, Smith said.
“People commonly believe that these survivors remained silent for 50 years,” Smith said. “But if you look at the mass of unpublished work of people who were told that the world ‘wasn’t interested in World War II,’ you realize these survivors weren’t silent. They were silenced.”
Chaiken said the Shoah Foundation’s visual history archives and the Doheny Memorial Library’s and Von KleinSmid Center’s Library’s collections of written and visual Holocaust and genocide testimonies are important resources for students and artists.
“[These genocides] are not something from the past because they continue to happen again and again. There are places still in danger,” said Chaiken.
Kyungseo Min, a freshman majoring in theatre, said artists play an important role in portraying positive events in Jewish history.
“Jewish history is marked by such negative things, and I really want to learn more about the brighter side through the theater aspect,” said Min.
I read this article with great interest. Even long before my first visit to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC (in search of information about my husband’s Jewish ancestors from Romania), the subject of persecution of the Jews has been near to my heart. If Betsy Salkin’s comedic approach to the Holocaust can be a catalyst to inform the uninformed, and challenge the deniers of this tragic event in Jewish history, so be it.  I applaud her efforts and wish her success.  To Stacie Chaiken I say, thank you.  Next Year in Jerusalem is a work of art; and art can change the heart of a society.   Jews are still being silenced.  Our country is guilty, even now, of anti-semitism;  and in many countries Jews and Christians alike are forced to practice their religion according to their government’s restrictive standards, or worship their God in secret. The Bible is currently illegal in 52 countries, and having one in possession is often punishable by imprisonment or death.
Thank you for writing an excellent article on this informative art conference.
I hope one day the foundation adds the testimonies of the victims of the Nakba while they’re still around to share them as well.

Jared Ginsburg and Sam Coxe are running to be Undergraduate Student Government’s president and vice president, respectively, with the goal of improving the Trojan experience through an emphasis on student input.
Ginsburg, a junior majoring in political science, currently serves as the USG director of campus affairs. Coxe, a sophomore majoring in psychology, serves as a Greek senator.

“We decided to run because of our passion for the Trojan Family, but at the same time, as great of a school as USC is, and the endless amount of opportunities it offers, we both see room for improvement,” Coxe said.
Ginsburg and Coxe are running on a platform that calls for a three- to five-day fall break in October, the opening of a university-sponsored textbook exchange, the pursuit of corporate sponsorship to bring more well-known artists to campus and improvements to the Lyon Center, including finger scan detection to enter the Lyon Center and a camera that allows students to monitor the Lyon Center’s traffic flow online.
“Every item on our platform has already been reviewed by USC senior administrators, so when we’re out there on Trousdale campaigning with students, we’re not making empty promises,” Ginsburg said. “If elected, we’re going to be committed to making sure [our platform] is implemented.”
Ginsburg and Coxe plan to stay connected with the student body by improving the transparency of USG and increasing the number of surveys distributed to students.
“We want to make the interaction between USG and the student body far more transparent than it is,” Ginsburg said. “The student body needs to feel far closer to the Undergraduate Student Government and feel that we are a resource for them. We’re here to help them.”
Ginsburg and Coxe said their platform is unique because it contains a long-term plan for future generations of Trojans.
“A lot of our platform points are one-year plans that we want to have completed by the end of our term, but a lot of things are ideas we want to lay the foundation for, so when the subsequent terms come in, they can build on it,” Coxe said. “We want to create a five- to 10- year blueprint for some of the things.”
As the university continues to expand, Ginsburg and Coxe said, it is essential that student input be incorporated into the design and functionality of the new buildings.
“The USC Master Plan is redeveloping the University Village, and we have to make sure we have student input in there,” Ginsburg said. “We have to know what type of restaurants, what type of supermarkets, what type of services and stores are going to be provided and available for all students at those venues.”
Ginsburg is involved in academic organizations such as Marshall Business Student Government, Marshall Student Ambassadors, Global Leadership Program and Alpha Lambda Delta Honor Society and political and cultural groups including USC Hillel, Trojans for Israel and College Republicans. He is also a member of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.
Coxe is a Trojan Spirit Leader, vice president of the Operation Smile club, membership chair for a Best Buddies chapter, a member of Society 53 and vice president of Panhellenic Council for Delta Gamma.
Ginsburg and Coxe said their involvement in various organizations on campus has prepared them for being president and vice president of USG.
“This means more to us than anything we’re doing at USC, and we really want to show to the student body, through our care for what we’ve done so far, that, if elected, we will translate this effort into our administration,” Ginsburg said.

Many students involved with the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community had mixed reactions to news on Tuesday that a federal court ruled Proposition 8 unconstitutional.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the 2008 ballot initiative violated the 14th Amendment’s promise to give all citizens equal legal status.
“Proposition 8 serves no purpose and has no effect, other than to lessen the status and human dignity of gays and lesbians in California, and to officially reclassify their relationships and families as inferior to those of opposite-sex couples,” the court said. “The Constitution simply does not allow for ‘laws of this sort.’”
The court upheld a 2010 ruling by U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker. Some news sources have reported that the Supreme Court could see the case as early as next year while others have said the case might only apply to California.
Genevieve Flores, 22, a graduate student studying public administration, said she and her girlfriend of four years felt reserved about the ruling.
“I’m not planning any weddings and we’re not buying rings, but we’re optimistic,” Flores said. “We’re still cautious.”
Flores and her girlfriend were a year into their relationship during the five-month window in which same-sex marriage was legal.
“Now we’re living together,” Flores said. “If we were a straight couple, the path would be marriage.”
Norman Chootong, a freshman majoring in computer science, had the same hesitant optimism about getting the legal right to marry in the future.
“The day that the Supreme Court decides we can marry, because I know it will happen and I hope it will be in my lifetime, I’m going to get really emotional,” Chootong said. “Now I’m just waiting for the next step to happen.”
Director of the LGBT Center Vincent Vigil said legalizing same-sex marriage would also affect students who are not in a same-sex relationship.
“We may have students here who are children of same-sex parents,” Vigil said. “We might have students who have an uncle or aunt who’s gay. This decision trickles down and affects everyone in USC in some way — whether it’s a loved one, a family member or their parents.”
Glenn Andrew, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said he wanted the issue to go to the Supreme Court so he could still be married if he visited his home state of Louisiana.
“I believe this country is in a place where, if it does go to the Supreme Court, it’s going to pass,” Andrew said.
Elizabeth Soriano, a sophomore majoring in communication, said she was elated when a friend texted her about the news Tuesday.
“I can get married and be not seen as a second-class citizen,” Soriano said. “I’m like everybody else. Why should the government decide who I can marry?”
Vigil also said that, in 2008, a student group called Trojans for Equality organized phone banks to encourage people to vote against Proposition 8.
“This is a great victory but now, moving forward, we can’t be apathetic,” Vigil said. “We have to think, ‘What is the next thing we have to do to make sure gay marriage is legal in California?’”
Thank you Rachel for writing this article!
How exactly is giving the right to the state to intervene in private relationships changing GLBTs from a second class citizen status to a first class citizen status?
Do GLBTs really want break ups to be moderated through the court system? 
I see this as a ruling against the freedom of GLBTs and an invitation for more government intervention in their affairs.

Undergraduate Student Government President Monish Tyagi spoke about USC’s “forward-moving mentality”  and signed a commendation of the football program on Tuesday night at the State of the Student Body address.
Tyagi revived a USG tradition of delivering an annual speech, which has not been exercised for several years.
“Starting about a month ago, the senators decided it would be cool to bring this back,” Tyagi said before the speech. “I’m glad we were able to.”
In his speech, Tyagi said student life at USC is defined by progress.
“When you take away all of the tangible items — the programs, the projects, the meetings, the events — student life at USC, at it’s core, really boils down to a feeling of connection,” Tyagi said.
He said this connection between USC students was most evident when the Trojans across the country watched junior quarterback Matt Barkley announce that he would return next season. Tyagi paraphrased Barkley’s remarks because he said they were emblematic of USC’s desire for constant improvement.
“We have some serious unfinished business to attend to, and [we] intend to play a part in it,” Tyagi said. “That is the USC mentality. That is the USC way. There is always unfinished business.”
Though Tyagi highlighted many achievements from his term, which expires in early April, he said he wanted to avoid a “laundry-list recitation of accomplishments.”
While Tyagi noted the importance of future work, Tyagi said his administration achieved both of its primary goals: relationship-building and addressing student needs through advocacy and programming.
“In my mind, the state of student life and the state of the student body at USC has never been better,” Tyagi said.
Before delivering his speech, the USG Senate unanimously passed a resolution commending the football team for its season. The resolution was sponsored by Residential Senator Jordan Vieira and sponsored by Greek Senator Cody Rapp and Residential Senator Samantha Coxe. Resolutions officially communicate the student body’s opinion on an issue.
“They also reinvigorated the Trojan spirit and fervor in a way that will intimidate any team we play next year,” USG Greek Senator Cody Rapp said.
Director of Football Operations Jeff Fucci, redshirt junior quarterback John Manoogian, freshman offensive guard Cyrus Hobbi, redshirt junior punter Kyle Negrete, senior defensive end Armond Armstead and redshirt senior cornerback Boomer Roepke attended the event.
Hobbi and Roepke spoke after the resolution’s passage. Though Hobbi thanked USG for passing the resolution, he hopes fans at the Coliseum will be more enthusiastic next year.
“We need to get a little louder in the Coliseum,” Hobbi said. “We have great support [in the students section], but we need to pick it up.”

Nike creator Phil Knight attended Oregon and hired Hollister as one of the company’s first employees when it was under the name Blue Ribbon Sports.
Hollister is also responsible for the development of the “waffle sole,” a concept that has carried over to modern shoes. He wrote an autobiography in 2008 titled Out of Nowhere. Information on his cause of death was not released by the University.
 
Women’s track team ranked No. 1
The Oregon women’s track and field team is the top-ranked team in the country for the fourth week in a row, as ranked by the United States Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association.

When asked why he chose to give USC football his oral commitment last week, prized recruit Zach Banner replied simply that it “was the perfect fit.”
What the offensive tackle from Lakes High in Lakewood, Wash., probably doesn’t realize is that his recruitment to USC is the perfect fit for not one but two athletic teams on campus.
Though Rivals.com ranked Banner as the class of 2012’s 16th-best prospect on the gridiron, the 18-year-old’s athletic pedigree extends to a place this university could really use help: the hardwood.
At six-foot-eight, 290 pounds, Banner served as the starting center for Lakes High’s 3A Championship team last season and drew attention from five Division-I schools, including four from the Pac-12 Conference.
“Banner is a load to stop in the paint area,” said Tony Wroten on ESPN.com. “He has soft hands, good feet and a wide body to ward off defenders. He has a great demeanor about him and just plays the game at an even keel.“
So in essence, he’s everything USC coach Kevin O’Neill and company have lacked during their six-win campaign in 2011-2012.
Upon his decision to come to Southern California, Banner made very clear his intentions to one day play under the Galen Center lights.
Though it’s been reported over the last week that USC coach Lane Kiffin and O’Neill have given their blessing regarding the incoming freshman’s lofty plans, I’m suggesting he serve as the rule, not the exception.
It’s not uncommon to see Trojan football players make the leap from the Coliseum to Cromwell Field, whether it’s Tony Burnett, D.J. Morgan, or most recently, Marqise Lee.  It’s time, however, to lobby for the USC men’s basketball team to receive some much-needed support at a time of great need.
Playing two high-profile sports that have overlapping schedules is not an easy task. And to excel at both, even the most skilled athletes need to typically prepare close to year-round. Add in the potential risk of injury, and it’s easy to understand the reluctance coaches and players often have regarding the topic.
Nonetheless, even as national championship hopes rest comfortably in the visible horizon, the current USC football roster is filled with players whose skills on a basketball court should not be limited to a pick-up game at the Lyon Center.
For those who have witnessed the football team’s recent propensity for organizing these five-on-five games at the gym, whether against each other or against unfortunate members of the student populace, the question has to be raised: Why is their talent being wasted on recreation?
We all marveled at Lee’s acrobatic catches against Oregon at Autzen Stadium this season. But that same 38-inch vertical leap made him a bona fide star on the Serra High hoops team his senior year in 2010, when he averaged more than 12 points per game to help lead the Cavaliers to a 35-4 record and the CIF-SS State Championship. For his efforts, Lee was named to the Daily Breeze’s All-South Bay first team.
Can you imagine him running the wing on a fast break with Maurice Jones?
Lob City 2.0 would put your butts in the seats every other week at the Galen Center, something that hasn’t happened since the days of O.J. Mayo and Demar Derozan.
When asked about the idea of the two-sport athlete, Kiffin told ESPNLosAngeles.com back in October that USC is all for it, because it helps the university and keeps players competitive year-round.
But to be honest, outside of a miniscule few on the track team, I am not seeing that “all for one and one for all” mentality across the athletic department.
If the school and the football program are so for it, why should Banner be the lone player to test unchartered waters in the coming years?
While Mike Williams and Dwayne Jarrett were helping USC win Rose Bowls and national championships in the mid-2000s, the two former high school basketball greats never suited up for Henry Bibby or Tim Floyd. It was a wasted opportunity then, but it doesn’t have to be now.
Just ask schools like California, North Carolina and Miami, that over the years benefited from the services of a Tony Gonzalez, Julius Peppers or Jimmy Graham. They’d be the first to tell you that both their programs were better served because of those players’ commitment to fulfilling multiple athletic endeavors.
I am not suggesting the school undertake a PR ploy to generate ticket sales or promote false hopes among a fan base. It’s a shame to tight-cast student-athletes into one sport, when they might possess the passion and skill set to compete in several.
It’s time for the basketball program to stop looking for help in the form of transfers hailing from junior colleges and other universities across the country, and instead start looking internally.
2012 has the potential to be a banner year on the football field, so all I am asking is for the love to be spread to the less fortunate.
Sometimes you’ve got to give a little to get a little.

What, if anything, would be wrong with recruiting scholarship athletes in other sports who could also play football? Just asking …
Interesting that each article on Zach Banner has a different height and weight for him. He is either 6’8 or 6’9 and weighs anywhere between 290 and 335. No way is he going to play basketball at USC with the two sports over-
lapping especially with a Bowl game involved now that sanction lifted in that area. Greg Gunther last one to try
that double for two years with him being a little more agile than Banner appears.

Seven former USC football players have been invited to the NFL Scouting Combine, the Los Angeles Times reports. The players are defensive end Nick Perry, offensive tackle Matt Kalil, defensive tackle DaJohn Harris, linebacker Chris Galippo, defensive tackle Christian Tupou, running back Marc Tyler and tight end Rhett Ellison.
Next level · Senior fullback Rhett Ellison was one of seven Trojans invited to the NFL Scouting Combine. The former USC players will participate in a series of tests that will help determine where they are ultimately drafted. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
The combine will take place at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis from Feb. 22-28. It serves as a testing ground for players who have declared their draft eligibility. Participants will be tested in their 40-yard dash times, bench press, agility, vertical jump and intelligence by way of the Wonderlic Test. Players also participate in positional drills. Depending on their success, the participant’s draft position could rise or slide harshly after the combine takes place.
General managers from all 32 teams will attend the event to see the 300-plus players in action. The biggest draw from the Trojans will likely be Kalil, the six-foot-seven, 295-pound tackle from Corona, Calif. Kalil was a first team All-American last season, and most analysts have him projected as a top-five overall pick. His brother Ryan was an All-American at USC as well and is now a Pro Bowler for the Carolina Panthers.
Scouts will also be taking a close look at Perry, who, like Kalil, left school with a year left in his eligibility. Perry measures in at six-foot-three, 250 pounds. He was first team all-conference last season, registering a conference-high 9.5 sacks. He set a state record in his hometown of Detroit by collecting 36 sacks his senior year. He is a projected first-round pick.
Harris started his last two seasons at USC, collecting 72 tackles in his career. Tupou was a team captain in 2011 and collected 16 tackles on the year. He tore his anterior cruciate ligament as a junior and was unable to play the 2010 season. He started 33 games during his USC career.
Tyler, the son of former St. Louis Rams runningback Wendell Tyler, led the team in rushing in the 2010 season, accumulating 913 yards and nine touchdowns on the ground. He was suspended for the first game of 2011 but still had more than 500 yards rushing on the season, finishing second on the team behind junior Curtis McNeal.
Ellison was also a team captain in 2011, moving from his customary tight end position to fullback to compensate for a lack of depth. Ellison caught 22 passes in 2011 and scored two touchdowns. In his career, he caught 53 passes for 471 yards and six touchdowns. His versatility will likely be appealing to many general managers.
Galippo started 30 games in his career at USC. The six-foot-two, 250-pound linebacker collected 47 tackles in his senior season, along with an interception. He also registered one and a half sacks.
After the combine, former USC players will have the opportunity to participate in the school’s Pro Day, which is supplemental testing for players who wish to improve upon their combine numbers. USC’s Pro Day will take place March 7 at Brian Kennedy Field.

Los Angeles’ drinking culture carries an unfortunate stereotype. In the eyes of many, it involves exclusive Hollywood clubs, overpriced champagne and essentially the same variations on vodka and soda.
But to simply look at it — and indulge — from that mindset ignores the vibrant cocktail and craft drink scene that has sprung up in various locales around the city.
Los Angeles used to have a strong cocktail presence: The Tiki culture bloomed in the 1950s, not to mention the martinis and Gibsons that flew around like crazy during the Golden Age of Hollywood.
In the past few decades, however, the L.A. cocktail scene has given way to nightclubs where quickly made, trendier drinks are celebrated.
Like the city itself, Los Angeles’ drinking scene has had a resurgence from its less flashy roots. Spurred by a national cocktail revival and filtered through Los Angeles’ love of experimentation and reinvention, there are now dozens of places around the city to grab a craft beer or an artisan cocktail.
This also means college students in Los Angeles can widen their palate beyond traditional fare.
If beer is your drink of choice, there are alehouses and pubs scattered across Los Angeles to help you out. If you’re near the Arts District, visit Little Bear, a new Belgian pub with a menu that goes deep into Belgium’s breweries — and not just the more familiar brew names like Chimay.
On the west side, Smith House in Santa Monica has more than 150 beers to choose from and a great selection of flights if you want to sample more than one brew.
If you’re in Hollywood, ignore the velvet rope clubs and check out some cheaper, tastier alternatives. The Library Bar in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel might seem like an odd choice, but it puts a great spin on drinks. Since the menu focuses entirely on fresh ingredients, its selection of ingredients changes from season to season.
Also in Hollywood is Harvard & Stone. The vibe and location are hipster, but the drinks make up for any misgivings you might have. It even features an “R&D” bar in the back, where bartenders create unique spins on a rotating set of spirits.
Though it’s convenient to get a great drink everywhere across the city, the best places to imbibe are located Downtown. Packed together in a few city blocks — and wonderfully close to USC — these bars are great places to find fresh takes on traditional alcohol pairings, as well as revivals of forgotten standards.
If you’re looking for a mix of classic cocktails, a great beer selection and moderate prices, Cole’s on Sixth and Main streets is the place to go. It’s focused on classic cocktails from the pre- and early post-Prohibition era with an excellent menu of craft beers, drinks and a rotating assortment of specialty cocktails. The bar is small but worth it for the relaxed atmosphere and friendly bartenders.
And if you don’t mind paying a little extra, walk to the back of Cole’s and visit The Varnish. It’s a speakeasy with some of the most talented bartenders in the city. The alcohol catalog is extensive, and the bartenders’ knowledge even more so. If you’re new to drinking, try the “bartender’s choice,” where they’ll put together a cocktail based on a few questions about your flavor preferences. Crowds can pick up on the weekend, so try to make it there before 9:30 p.m. to get a table.
One of the amazing things about the L.A. drinking scene is its diversity. It’s easy to go from one bar specializing in drinks made from only locally grown, seasonal ingredients, to an alehouse that only imports European beers.
When Downtown, one can walk out of the mezcal-focused Las Perlas, walk a few blocks and find the whiskey bar Seven Grand. Each place has its own specialties and style, so there are endless possibilities in what you can have. If you’re new to cocktails, or trying to find different flavors, go out and explore the different bars the city has to offer.
And if you’re looking for a place to get a good meal alongside a drink, try Bar|Kitchen at Eighth and Flower streets.
It’s a bit quieter than places like Cole’s and offers a bit more space to breathe and enjoy your drink. If nothing else, consider the fact that many bartenders from other establishments can often be found indulging at the bar there.
Craft bars might not outnumber nightclubs, but the effort and creativity put into each drink menu easily overtakes the latter. Why go for low-quality drinks when we live in a city with a booming cocktail scene?

Traditionally a showcase for pork and beef, charcuterie is a delicious assortment of smoked and cured meats and pâtés, often served with bread, cheese and a pickled veggie or two.
But charcuterie is now having a seafood moment.
A survey of popular chefs in the Boston Globe determined that seafood charcuterie is the number one restaurant trend of 2012. In the past six months, in New England and Florida, I’ve encountered tuna and salmon pastrami: a new and unconventional preparation of these fishes. Smoked fish and fish pâtés are now easily found at all the crave-worthy spots in Los Angeles.
But the biggest surprise is that seafood charcuterie was not been popularized sooner. Pepper has always been a common seasoning for fish, so a peppery, pastrami-like crust on the meat makes total, delicious sense. And creamy fish spreads are filling without the gut-busting feeling that a terrine of pork livers delivers.
In light of the current season, this interest in fish charcuterie feels just right. Transitioning into the lighter fare of springtime, smoked and cured fish strikes a nuanced flavor profile, balancing light, subtle meat and spice flavors.
If those flavors seem off-putting — as in, if you are one of the many people suppressing your gag-reflex just thinking of “fishy” tasting salmon — think again.
Treating fish as charcuterie controls the flavors. Smoking trout curbs the fish’s saltiness. At your discretion, lemon juice and horseradish in salmon pâtés can add depth or disguise the fish’s natural flavor.
Downtown Los Angeles’ Church and State bistro serves its salmon rillettes — salmon cooked slowly in fat — in glass jars alongside crusty slices of baguette. This combination of smoked as well as cooked salmon exemplifies how vastly different preparations of the same fish can taste.
As a sidenote, if you’re fortunate enough to snag a table at this hard-to-find bistro, wash each creamy bite down with a Rosemary Collins — a savory rosemary perfumed cocktail. It’s a perfect Provençal pairing.
Charcuterie need not be sophisticated. Son of a Gun on Third Street in West Hollywood offers a smoked Mahi fish dip. Plastic-wrapped saltines are provided for your scooping and spreading pleasure. It’s simple, sure, but the humble presentation smooths out the intimidation of tasting a fish you haven’t had this way.
If you’re usually a reluctant host, enjoying seafood charcuterie at home is for you. It requires no cooking, only the purchasing of prepared fish. Most examples of smoked trout and salmon come in a variety of prepackaged preparations with lemon or pepper and garlic seasoning. Similarly, fish spreads can often be found in the seafood section of the supermarket.
The complements to fish charcuterie are important as well. One benefit of fish charcuterie over the meat variety is how well it pairs with citrus; it is citrus season, after all, so present some grapefruit or blood orange sections as a refreshing garnish.
You can also provide some easy-to-spread goat cream cheese, as Suzanne Goin does at her restaurant A.O.C. The creamy-yet-dry consistency combines well with the oiliness of fish, and a thick slice of fresh, ripe tomato makes flavors pop. Place the pairing, along with some smoked or cured fish, atop a piece of grilled bread and you might never want to eat anything else.
It is with the utmost encouragement that I recommend that you experience this silky, luscious combination. It’s sexy — well, as sexy as an open-faced fish sandwich can be.
Seafood charcuterie, like its pork and beef cousins, welcomes creativity and a do-it-yourself spirit. Humans have been curing and smoking fishes since man obtained a spear and learned, probably the hard way, that the stabbed fish required preservation.
Bacon and sausage fanatics have seen their favorite meats rise to the highest levels of culinary inspiration for years. It’s time to shut the meatheads up with a worthy successor. It’s time to return to the unsung hero that is deliciously cured seafood.
The answer, you see, is in the sea.

Here’s an anecdote to keep the boldness of South African rave-rap group Die Antwoord in perspective: Piqued by the success of a viral video — “Zef Side” — Die Antwoord had released, major label Interscope Records flew the members out to the United States and signed the group to a million-dollar contract.
Zef side · MCs Yo-Landi Vi$$er (left) and Ninja (right), as well as DJ Hi-Tek make up Die Antwoord. The group promotes and satirizes South African Zef culture and hardcore gangster imagery in their songs. - Photo courtesy of Press Here Publicity
Considering hardly anyone in the United States had heard of the trio, it was a big move — and obviously a big deal for smaller artists trying to attract attention.
But Die Antwoord’s newest album, Ten$ion, wasn’t released on Interscope, or any recognizable label, for that matter. That’s because the group quit Interscope and released it on its own. Why?
“[Interscope] kept pushing us to be more generic,” MC Yo-Landi Vi$$er told Spin in January 2012. “We didn’t want to put out any wack sh-t.”
It’s good news Die Antwoord has kept its integrity on Ten$ion. That middle-finger-in-the-air, riotously independent attitude can be found everywhere on the new album, and it’s better off for it.
The sound of Ten$ion, along with Die Antwoord’s image and general swagger, for that matter, is difficult to describe. It’s a wild mashup that features often-indecipherable lyricism, delivered in English, Afrikaans and even a touch of Xhosa. These lyrics are paired with a variety of huge, ambitious beats that recall everything from Dre’s best late- 90s productions to house and dubstep that would make even Deadmau5 smile.
And for better or worse, Ten$ion refuses to commit to one particular style. It’s kind of like the group itself, the musical equivalent of Vi$$er’s awe-inspiring blond mullet and co-MC Ninja’s trusted scowl and DJ Hi-Tek’s gigantic gold chain and pot-leaf bandana.
Does it make sense? Not really. Is it still awesome? Well, of course.
Take the opening track “Never Le Nkemise 1,” for example. It begins beautifully, with a melancholy choir and strings crescendoing in the background, as another ensemble sings the words Never le nkemise.
Cue the madness: Ninja yells I’m indestructible! as the dubstep bass drops like a piano off a 12-story building, groaning and rumbling along with the choir, odd sound effects — the cocking of a gun, for instance — cracking in the background.
A good album, however, doesn’t sustain itself on weirdness alone. It’s easy to pass off Ten$ion as such, what with all the random musical influence and skits — the latter including the bizarre “Uncle Jimmy,” which sounds like a creepy diss at Interscope head Jimmy Iovine. But on repeated listens, Ten$ion proves that, for the most part, it has the musical chops to keep up with its rampant eccentricity.
The album’s second single, “I Fink U Freeky,” is a perfect example. Though Vi$$er’s coquettish, hyper-feminine voice chanting I think you’re freaky / And I like you a lot sounds a little strange at first, the rapid-fire rap flow that follows is convincingly skilled. Ninja flexes his MC muscles on the track, building lyrical momentum in the bridge over an entrancing beat from DJ Hi-Tek that slowly but surely — and cleverly — ramps up the speed of the song.
There’s also an impressive amount of creativity in Ten$ion, often in unexpected ways — on “U Make a Ninja Wanna F-ck,” Ninja slips in, of all things, a Tommy James and the Shondells reference, crooning I think we’re alone now / There doesn’t seem to be anyone around.
And the instrumentation of the tracks is often shockingly good: Check out the frenetic tribal drums of “Fatty Boom Boom,” which charges along with cracking hand claps and Diplo-esque laser tones and samples of machine guns. It’s a balls-out fight song at its finest.
But the eclectic nature of the album can, at times, be a little head-scratching.
“DJ Hi-Tek Rulez,” for example, is hilarious and offensive: It takes the words of boxer Mike Tyson’s infamous rant, which can’t be published here without extensive censoring, at a heckler and places it over a bouncing hip-hop beat. Why include this track? Hard to say. The pop-culture reference might inspire a smile, but the track doesn’t really work as a song; it’s more for giggles than anything else.
Though Ten$ion’s inconsistency from a musical standpoint is fun, it might frustrate some listeners who want more continuity from track to track. Die Antwoord seems to be a group that, in the future, will learn to focus its explosive energy and enthusiasm into more cohesive works.
“The only real thing in life is the unexpected things. Everything else is just an illusion,” Ninja says in a short film about the group.
If that’s the case, Ten$ion stands proudly, flaws and all, as one of the most real albums in recent memory, a line drawn in the sand with Honey Badger-like stubbornness by three incredibly unique artists.

EVK Restaurant and Grill has only three options you can really count on: chicken nugget Tuesdays, Caesar salad and French fries. These foods are among students’ favorite dining hall specialties, but they are hardly suitable staples for a student’s diet.
Lener Jimenez | Daily Trojan
 
For vegetarians, the popular cafeteria foods are reduced to salad and fries. And for vegans, gluten-free eaters, kosher eaters and plain healthy eaters, the choices are even more limited.
Fortunately, USC Hospitality is responding to student feedback.
By summer 2012, King Hall, which houses Café 84, will become a buffet-style dining hall like EVK and The Parkside Restaurant — with a twist.
The change will give next year’s students with dining plans a third, healthier option.
USC Hospitality Director Kris Klinger has said that the new swipe-in facility will be modeled after Whole Foods, offering plenty of healthy food. The goal of the transformation is to have an improved salad bar and more made-to-order options alongside familiar dining hall hot foods, with an emphasis on local, sustainable ingredients.
The diverse student body USC prides itself in comes with a variety of dietary needs. More choices mean better odds for students with dietary restrictions. A made-to-order food bar would allow vegetarians to keep meat out of their stir-fry orders and would allow people with allergies to avoid their allergens. They will not have to settle for fries, salad and plain rice.
A swipe-in facility in King Hall will allow students with meal plans to get more for their money. Students with the basic plan will no longer be excluded from high-quality food on campus or have to pay out of pocket to get it. The Gold Meal Plan allows students to use their dining dollars at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center or Trojan Grounds while taking advantage of their swipes at a healthier dining hall. And the Trojan Meal Plan users can still spend their abundant dining dollars everywhere on campus, including dining halls.
Upperclassmen might protest the transition to a swipe-in dining hall. Saying goodbye, however, to Jamba Juice, Daphne’s Greek Café and Wasabi Sushi is more cost-efficient for freshmen, who are required to purchase a costly meal plan if they live on campus. The majority of upperclassmen live off campus, where other options are easy to come by.
Some students who live off campus depend on Café 84 for lunch and snacks, but the change will not exclude them entirely. They might choose the community meal plan that includes dining dollars and swipes, both of which would be usable at the new King Hall facility.
Considering the price of entrées and beverages at Café 84 presently, the cost to eat at the new buffet-style dining hall would not be significantly greater — a swipe at EVK costs $11.50. Students could get larger, healthier portions for their money’s worth.
Thanks to the efforts of USC Hospitality and steady student feedback, changes are coming quickly to USC’s dining facilities.
Keep responding to surveys and voicing your opinion. USC Hospitality is making positive changes, but there is still more work to be done.
 
Kate Kuczynski is a freshman majoring in linguistics.
I disagree with the author’s opinion that the meals would not become not significantly greater in price. If we estimate a current average price of meals at Cafe 84 at $8, the price hike to $11.50 would mean equates to a 44% price increase. If this is not significant, I don’t know what is.
The author argues that for the price, the students will get a healthier, larger portions of foods. However, this may sounds oxymoronic to some. One of the bigger problem of average american diet is its large portions. The food maybe healthier, but essentially forcing students to eat larger portions to get their money’s worth may negate many of its benefits.
While I agree with the author’s main point, that it is better for Cafe 84 to become a dining hall rather than continue as a food court, I feel that both the author and USC Hospitality continue to miss the mark when attempting to make healthy food available on campus. I am not a vegetarian. I do not have food allergies. USC Hospitality continues to fail not only those two classes of people, but also “ordinary” eaters such as myself. 
When you visit Parkside or EVK, what options are there for fresh vegetables? Two or more varieties of rice? Some kind of plain beans? Mashed potatoes? These are hardly sufficient. The only reliable source of freshness are the salad bars at both locations. You are lucky to find a single pan of steamed broccoli in the buffet, or possibly some exceptionally dry sliced carrots. EVK has recently begun offering corn- however it is corn that appears to have committed suicide in a bath of melted butter. The bottom line is, there need to be more healthy, appetizing vegetables served in the dining hall steam tables. A single “fresh” item per day is not enough.

The public tends to view graffiti negatively; it is often washed away almost as quickly as it appears. Graffiti, however, can take a wide variety of forms, from the most basic expressions of youthful rebellion to the enchanting works of artists like Banksy. When it is created in the context of an impactful movement, street art can achieve a cultural significance that is hard to ignore.
Take the murals painted around City Hall during Occupy L.A., for example. Painted on plywood walls erected to protect monuments from the occupiers, the murals are covered with symbols, slogans and other creative interpretations of the movement.
These murals are sure to strike a chord in this university, as Occupy L.A. touched USC in a variety of ways. Students left and right raised awareness, spoke out against it and even participated in the protests.
When the park was cleared, the walls were taken down. A month later, the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs called for museums, galleries, arts organizations or educational institutions to store and exhibit the artwork. The Occupy L.A. website quickly denounced the idea, saying that the artwork was by the people and for the people. Protestors claimed that the murals should be returned to them so they — not the city officials — could decide who would preserve them.
Are the creators of graffiti art entitled to ask for it back? History says otherwise.
Some of the most famous graffiti in the world can be found on the Berlin Wall. The wall remained operational for more than 40 years, dividing West and East Berlin and serving as a potent symbol for oppression and divisiveness.
Walking in Berlin, one can still see fragments of the wall throughout the city. They are covered in art, accumulated from decades of frustration. The city proudly exhibits them as a testament to the hardships it has endured and to the creativity of the people responsible for the murals.
No one has asked for the art back. The graffiti symbolizes Berliner’s views of the wall, of what it stands for. Their message is one of freedom.
This context makes Occupy L.A.’s response seem comical. The occupiers’ demands for the return of the artwork seem to stem more out of an animosity for city hall than a wish for the art to remain “of the people.”
The city wants to exhibit these works for the people of Los Angeles. It could have very easily disposed of them after the clean up. Instead, it chose to do as Berlin had done and recognized them as a part of its history. What is this complaint if not a knee-jerk response against any association with the city’s government? Does the fact that the city is trying to exhibit the work make it somehow oppressive?
The leaders of what remains of the Occupy movement are merely finding fault in anything they can, so that their complaints will be publicized, and the movement won’t fade away just yet. It is along the lines of PETA asking SeaWorld to free their Orcas because of the 13th amendment.
It is the kind of movement whose polarizing nature demands attention. The Occupy protesters either inspired or inspired contempt. To some, they were heroes; to others, they were slobs. But in the end, they were always driving discussion; they occupied the news along with their respective lawns. Though the height of this movement has probably passed, it still manages to create new points of contention.
This mural issue is a prime example. But if the protestors continue to complain about the city’s decision, they risk becoming a farce.
 
Daniel Grzywacz is a sophomore majoring in neuroscience and anthropology. His column “72 Degrees and Shaking” runs Wednesdays.
the mural belongs to occupy los angeles. it is not a farce to ask for your own property. the camps may be gone but occupy LA, and all of the other occupy’s, are still here and growing. We have only just begun.
“[The Occupy Movement] risks becoming a farce”
Too late for that.

Today I’m going to talk a bit about sound in film and video.  Recording sound for videos and films is now easier than it has been at any point in time—most cameras come with fairly decent built-in mics, and some great external mics are available for not that much money.  Also, other devices can be utilized as an improvised mic when nothing else is available and a built-in mic isn’t cutting it—such as simply recording sound on an iPhone.
Despite this, many amateur videos and films have problems with sound. Whether it’s distracting background noises, scratchy or inaudible dialogue or a host of other problems, sound is really important to making a video or film sound professional.  In professional movies, almost every sound other than dialogue is usually created and edited by a foley artist.  Foley is the art of reproducing and creating sounds for film.  Foley artists are able to reproduce an amazing amount of sounds—from hooves beating to a sword being drawn—to make a film sound more realistic.  Also, multiple tracks can now be layered on top of each other to create a complex sound experience.
When shooting your own film or video, one of the simplest ways to ensure good sound quality is to stop before you start shooting, and just listen.  If you’re doing an interview, is the air conditioner too loud?  If you’re outside, is the sound of the wind blowing appropriate for your film?  Learning to roll with and integrate certain sound effects from the environment can be a great touch to a film/video, but it’s also nice to have a quiet, nicely edited short.

Last Tuesday, Bon Iver’s song “Holocene” was featured in a TV commercial for the upcoming Grammys. In the commercial, an idyllic snowy landscape turns into a flock of birds that then turns into a silhouette of B.I. frontman Justin Vernon, and then into the message, “WE ARE MUSIC,” and then into a message advertising the Grammys.
Incidentally, you can watch the Grammys next Sunday, February 12th, at 8/7c, only on CBS.
On Wednesday, USA Today published an interview with Justin Vernon in which the singer/songwriter discussed Bon Iver’s shoes, Bon Iver’s popularity, Bon Iver’s four Grammy nominations, Bon Iver’s then-upcoming Saturday Night Live appearance and his projects outside Bon Iver. When asked when Bon Iver’s next album will come out, Vernon said, “I’m guessing three years. But it could be five.”
Then last Thursday, Vernon told Billboard that Bon Iver turned down a chance to perform at the Grammys. The Recording Academy had asked the band to collaborate with another artist. According to Vernon: “We kind of said ‘fu*k you’ a little bit and they sort of acted like they wanted us to play, but I don’t think they wanted us to play.”
Saturday Night Live featured Bon Iver in this week’s episode, called “Channing Tatum / Bon Iver.” Tatum pronounced “Bon Iver” correctly and the band performed “Holocene” and “Beth/Rest.”
And yesterday, Justin Vernon sparred publicly with hyper-ironic music blog Hipster Runoff. In response to a post on H.R. which mocked Bon Iver, Vernon tweeted, “who are you? you fu*king totally suck.” Since then Hipster Runoff has repeatedly tweeted self-pityingly about the incident, saying, for example: “Please send me #hashtags of love and support. I need them now more than evr.”
