Sen. Max Geschwind moved to censure Sen. Meagan Lane at an Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday. Geschwind alleged that Lane had not upheld officer conduct when she used “vulgarity” in a USG meeting two weeks ago during her senate update presentation. 
The Senate voted against the censure 11-1, with Geschwind casting the dissenting vote.
“I believe that we need to hold each other accountable,” Geschwind said during the meeting. “A couple of points in the agreement form that we signed was that we wouldn’t tarnish the reputation of this organization that we serve publicly. That’s what I believe happened two weeks ago due to [Lane’s] use of vulgarity and poor behavior.” 
At the Jan. 15 meeting, Lane delivered a routine update on her current USG activities. Similar to other senatorial updates delivered this semester, Lane began her presentation on a personal note by talking about her boyfriend and winter break.
“Quite frankly it just felt like a personal attack,” Lane told the Daily Trojan. “If I had said something offensive or done something I shouldn’t have done, then people would have remembered it, they would have known about it and it would have been dealt with. But it wasn’t.”
When asked by other senators to identify which comments he was referring to, Geschwind refused to name specific comments Lane made that prompted his motion to censure her.
“My memory has become a little fuzzy since those words were said, and I really don’t want to butcher the words accidentally,” Geschwind told the Daily Trojan after the meeting. 
During the meeting, Geschwind requested the senators vote through an anonymous ballot. They unanimously rejected his request, which resulted in a transparent vote.
Geschwind’s motion to censure Lane occurred a week before the USG voting period; Lane is currently campaigning for vice president. 
“It does feel very conveniently timed,” Lane said. “To bring something up that happened two weeks ago, the day after [the debate], is very suspicious … I don’t want to make any accusations about Sen. Geschwind … but in fairness to myself, it felt horrible to be up there. I was shaking [and] holding back tears.”
According to Geschwind, other USG members, who he requested remain anonymous, encouraged him to use his power as senator to call for Lane’s censure. 
“Max, your language tonight is not only coded, it is racially charged,” said Sen. Michaela Murphy, who is running for USG president as Lane’s partner. “I am … beyond disappointed in your actions tonight, especially the fact that you did not say anything to Meagan before this. It’s shocking.” 
Geschwind, a senior majoring in political science, is not eligible for re-election this year. 
“[Regarding] Sen. Murphy’s comments — because she said my comments were racially charged — I was so saddened to hear her say that,” Geschwind told the Daily Trojan. “I shouldn’t take it to heart because I feel like we were all a little caught off guard.”
Following the end of the vote, Geschwind told the Senate he should have reconsidered his actions during the meeting.
“The way I went about it was wrong. I regret some of the things I may have said,” Geschwind said. “Going back, I may have done it differently … I should have had that conversation with her.”

Jonathan Haile first jotted down the idea for his investment firm on the back of a napkin at The Standard in West Hollywood when he was a teenager. A semester into his studies at the Iovine and Young Academy, where he is pursuing his master’s degree, Haile’s business dreams are now becoming a reality. 
Haile, who spent his teenage years working in the entertainment industry, knew the potential of investing in social events. With the help of two co-founders, David Berry and Jake Kasheta, Haile launched Primary Endeavors, a boutique investment firm that specializes in parties and concerts, loosely based on his original back-of-a-napkin plan. The firm was officially launched at the beginning of January.
“[The three of us have] been working in different facets of entertainment, which is essentially the industry that we invest in, for a really long time,” Haile said. “For me, it was really important to develop my network and to develop a set of skills that were marketable and could be a real value add for the people we were working with.” 
Haile was born and raised in Los Angeles, and has worked in several entertainment positions since his high school years in 2007 — from contributing to marketing strategies for Repossession Records to being an agent trainee at Agency for the Performing Arts. 
After receiving his undergraduate degree in business from Pennsylvania State University, Haile moved back to the West Coast to  further develop his skills at USC. He is currently in his second semester at the Academy working toward his online Master of Science in integrated design, business and technology, which was launched in 2017 and is the first graduate program offered in the Academy.
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Iovine and Young Academy Dean Erica Muhl said the MS-IDBT program teaches students like Haile to work in innovative ways.
“Our students are taught … how to work through the longer periods of creative ambiguity and uncertainty that are necessary to envision truly innovative solutions,” Muhl wrote. 
Haile said he didn’t feel comfortable launching Primary Endeavors until he began his graduate studies.
“The seed was planted super early, and it’s something we’ve been trying to do for a long time,” Haile said.  “It was really important for us not to move on something until we were each prepared.” 
Haile’s business essentials professor Joshua Alexander said he believes Haile’s inherent traits were also part of the reason that he has been able to move forward as an entrepreneur. 
“[Haile] demonstrates an intellectual curiosity that I’ve noticed is very common in successful entrepreneurs,” Alexander said. “He has a very optimistic outlook. When you combine those two things together, it generally puts an entrepreneur or would-be entrepreneur on that track for success.” 
Berry, one of Primary Endeavors’ co-founding members, credited Haile for his creativity. 
“Jon is a really unique and creative person in different ways than most people,” Berry said. “Not so much in artistic ways, but in intellectual and logistical ways.” 
Haile said his primary goal for 2019 is to foster more local relationships and find business partners in Los Angeles. Though Primary Endeavors does not currently have a headquarters, the company is looking to move into an office Downtown in the coming weeks to make room for expansion.
Primary Endeavors invested in festival company Northern Nights Music Festival and loudspeaker manufacturer PK Sound in 2018, but the company wasn’t publicly launched until this year. 
“We were more interested in empowering other people that were already doing really cool things … than we were growing something from the ground up and having ourselves be the face of it,” Haile said. 
He said his firm’s decision to invest in entertainment and leisure rather than technology was purposeful, especially as a L.A.-based firm. As his firm enters its first year in the public eye, Haile said he is hopeful for the future.
“The economics of the entertainment industry are a little bit different than the economics of the tech industry,” Haile said. “Those companies have different needs than tech companies have, and if you feed those needs in unique ways, you can get different and … preferable outcomes.”

USC announced the opening of the Office of the Ombuds, an office dedicated to providing a safe place for faculty, staff and students to voice concerns and seek confidential support, according to a memo sent to the USC community Tuesday. 
After a nationwide search, Katherine Greenwood, who previously served as director of the Office of the Ombuds at UC Davis, and Thomas Kosakowski, who previously served as the UCLA Health System Ombudsperson, will respectively oversee the University Park Campus and Health Sciences Campus.
“The USC Office of the Ombuds will provide a safe place on both campuses for faculty, students and staff to navigate policies, issues, concerns and conflicts without fear of reprisal or judgement,” Provost Michael Quick and Vice Provost for Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention Varun Soni wrote in the memo. “In doing do [sic], the Office will promote and embody an ethical, empathetic and engaged university culture committed to problem-solving, dispute resolution and workplace wellness.” 
According to the memo, an ombudsperson is a “dispute resolution professional” who helps individuals navigate conflict and complaints. The office was created after the University recognized the need to create a safe and independent office for the USC community to share their concerns and challenges. 
“What I learned in the process of building the office is that we are probably the only top-tier research university in the country that [didn’t] have an ombuds office,” Soni said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We really thought we needed a place that is a safe and confidential place for faculty students and staff to discuss their concerns, to be connected  with resources, to strategize what their options might be.” 
Soni said that during the national search, the University sought individuals with experience in higher education and the health science enterprise. 
“We put the word out, encouraged lots of different people to apply, had an incredible pool and had a very rigorous search process,” he said. “We ended up hiring, in my opinion, the two best ombuds in American higher education and we are very lucky to have gotten them.” 
According to the memo, the office will share identifiable and anonymous patterns, trends and general concerns with the University. Greenwood hopes that in doing so, USC will make institutional changes and become more aware of campus issues. 
“I have witnessed and seen how the presence of an ombuds office allows people to share information,” Greenwood said. “Information is often the agent of change because if an institution or organization isn’t aware of information … A lot of times they don’t change because they don’t see the need.” 
Greenwood emphasized that while the office does not conduct investigations, adjudicate issues or provide counseling, it seeks to empower community members through consultation and conversation. 
“What our office can do is provide … upward feedback,” Greenwood said. “We’re providing amalgamated, anonymized information to the campus leadership at the appropriate level … and we can also encourage our visitors by giving them reporting mechanisms. There are new offices on campus that will conduct investigations, so we are trying to empower our visitors.” 
The Task Force on Workplace Standards and Employee Wellness established by the Office of the Provost suggested the idea of employing an ombud in Spring 2018. The office’s creation became part of a larger strategy USC is pursuing to increase transparency and accountability on campus. According to the University’s Change Progress Dashboard, Quick and Soni spearheaded the initiative, which is currently operational.
“We’re pleased to offer our USC community this valuable resource — an impartial, non-judgmental safe space,” Quick wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We have found the best people to provide guidance through challenging and concerning issues. We hope our community will take advantage of the USC Office of the Ombuds and find it a fair and equitable first step toward resolving these matters.” 
Students can access the ombuds at the University Religious Center by scheduling an appointment by phone or online.

USC has reportedly hired North Texas offensive coordinator Graham Harrell as its offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, according to Fox Sports’ Bruce Feldman on Twitter. 
USC Athletics has not officially confirmed the decision. However, head coach Clay Helton said an official announcement will come soon.
After losing offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury to the Arizona Cardinals one month after his hiring, USC began its search to fill his vacancy. Similar to Kingsbury, Harrell is known for his air-raid offense. 
Harrell became North Texas’ offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2016. In the 2018 season, North Texas finished with a 9-4 record at No. 20 in the nation for total offense with 460.5 yards per game, while the Trojans finished at No. 83. North Texas also held the 12th spot in passing yards per game with 306.8 and the 87th spot in rushing yards with 153.8. 
From 2004 to 2008, Harrell played quarterback under current Washington State head coach Mike Leach at Texas Tech, where he set NCAA records with 134 touchdown passes, second-most career yards and third-highest career passing average with 350.96 yards per game. 
Leach hired Harrell in 2014 as an offensive analyst at Washington State before he became the outside receivers coach.

Ranked for the first time this season, No. 15 USC men’s volleyball will face Princeton at home Thursday night.
Senior outside hitter Ryan Moss was named the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week after totaling 30 kills and hitting .439 in the Trojans’ two matches last week against No. 3 UC Irvine and No. 1 Long Beach State.
Moss and senior outside hitter Jack Wyett have been leading the offense this season with 97 and 95 kills and hitting percentages of .388 and .293, respectively. Both with 37 digs, Moss and senior libero Matt Douglas also lead the defense.
This season, the Trojans are directing their efforts toward improvement. 
“As a team, we can improve in every facet of the game,” Moss said. “I think we all know what we’re capable of, and we see it at times, but I still think we … can be more consistent with our play.”
The Princeton Tigers will make the most of their time out west with three games throughout the week, facing UC San Diego on Tuesday before they face USC on Thursday. The Tigers will finish their trip with a game against Cal State Northridge on Friday. 
Princeton holds a 1-5 record on the season but has already faced challenging top-ranked teams this season including No. 6 Pepperdine, No. 5 UCLA and No. 4 UC Irvine. Head coach Sam Schweisky notched his 100th win for the Tigers as they took down Erskine earlier this month in their only win of the season. 
Princeton’s junior opposite and middle blocker George Huhmann will be a player to watch. A preseason All-American with 65 kills and 17 blocks, he averages 3.3 kills and .9 blocks per game and boasts a .304 hitting percentage. Junior outside hitter Parker Dixon is also an offensive force with 64 kills, and junior outside hitter Greg Luck leads the defense with 26 digs and 16 blocks.
The Trojans will have to rely on their chemistry — an ongoing goal for USC this season, both on and off the court. 
“Our team spends a lot of time together outside of the gym, and I think that’s really important,” Moss said. “It helps our chemistry, and it makes it more fun when we get into the gym and work hard together.”
Moss also credits spending time in the gym as a key to the Trojans’ early success this season. 
“Our strength coach this year, Kurtis Schultz, has been an absolute privilege to work out for, and he’s pushed us in every aspect, especially physically, but mentally and emotionally too,” Moss said. “He’s just been such a big boost for our team, so whenever we have off-days before games when we get in the weight room with him, it’s always a treat.”
After upsetting UC Irvine 3-1 and falling to Long Beach State last week, the Trojans are looking to keep up the momentum they had against the Anteaters and prove that more strong wins are in store for this season. 
“I’ve been on teams here in years past where we’ve taken down No. 3 Long Beach or No. 3 UCLA,” Moss said. “We’ve had big wins, but we haven’t backed it up, so whether we’re playing Princeton or UCI next week … I think we can do a great job of just preparing for every match the same way and bringing the same intensity, consistency and level of play. That’s how we’re going to get better and keep pushing forward.”
USC will host Princeton at 7 p.m. Thursday at Galen Center.

While everyone in the NFL is trying to hire the next (young, upstart) Sean McVay, the reality is that seven of the last eight coaches left in the playoffs were at least 50 years old. NFL history has shown that a coach’s years-long accomplishments are ultimately the deciding factor when it comes to major games. The bottom line? Experience will decide the Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams.
There’s a reason why this will be the fourth time the Patriots will play in the Super Bowl in the past five years. They only have arguably the greatest player and the greatest coach of all time in Tom Brady and Bill Belichick; in addition, these two are the most experienced personnel the league has to offer.
Over the past five Super Bowls, the Patriots haven’t necessarily had the greatest supporting cast in the league. Often, I’m sitting on the couch, watching the big game and saying, “Who’s that guy?” when I’m watching the Patriots play. Yet, time after time, the Patriots seemingly find a way to win the American Football Conference and reach the Super Bowl.
This will be the ninth Super Bowl appearance in both Brady and Belichick’s illustrious Patriots careers (with the first dating back to 2002). Brady has suffered some disappointing losses during that time, yet he still has five rings to his name and is looking for his sixth after last year’s defeat of the Philadelphia Eagles. 
The Rams are a worthy opponent for the Patriots in the Super Bowl. Their star-studded lineup is stocked in almost every position. Their defense is full of big names like defensive tackle Aaron Donald, while the offense also boasts some of the best in the league, like running back Todd Gurley. 
Before the season started, I took a look at the Rams team and predicted that they would be Super Bowl champions. I originally questioned how Rams general manager Les Snead was able to fit all of these marquee players into the team’s salary cap. His ability to put this team together is undoubtedly impressive, and he has proved himself as one of the elite general managers in the game with the roster. 
As for McVay, there is a reason why every team in the league is looking at the young, tactically astute players’ coach. McVay’s work with the Rams has been tremendous, and he has set the standard for coaching hires in the NFL. Not only is he great with the players, but his charm off the field has also impressed many in and outside of the league. 
However, McVay is a one-of-a-kind coach in the NFL. In press conferences, he never ceases to amaze reporters with his photographic memory of games and his ability to describe plays that took place during games from years ago. No team will be able to find an exact replication of McVay, no matter how hard they try.
But McVay lacks the true big game experience Belichick brings to the table. At 33, McVay is half the age of Belichick, 66, and has played in nine fewer Super Bowls. While McVay may have a couple of tricks up his sleeve, Belichick has likely already seen every trick in the book and will know how to cope with any of McVay’s plans. 
McVay and most of the Rams have never made a Super Bowl appearance before. Meanwhile, the Patriots have been to the last three. New England is used to the big-game environment, and its fanbase has come to expect great performances from them. But for most Rams players and fans, this will be the biggest game of their lives. The players’ nerves will most certainly play a part in this game.
As for the quarterback position, while the Rams’ Jared Goff has had an impressive season this year and has great potential, there is no denying that Brady is much better than Goff at this moment. That’s not a knock on Goff, who performed brilliantly in his last game against the Saints, but rather the reality of Brady’s prowess. As with the game against the Chiefs in the AFC Championship, everyone knew as soon as the Patriots won the coin toss that Brady would put the game to bed. He’s cool under pressure and has consistently shown his quality when it matters.
A new, fun generation is shaping up in the NFL. With McVay’s Rams and Patrick Mahomes’ Chiefs, the NFL’s next generation looks like it is in place to take the league by storm over the next few years. Every football fan is now looking forward to the energetic path the league is going. But right now, the league still belongs to Brady and Belichick’s Patriots.

Hot off a trio of dominant conference victories, the USC men’s basketball team hits the road this week to take on Washington and Washington State. 
The team vaulted the conference rankings over the weekend, moving quickly to the No. 2 slot early in a season of well-balanced Pac-12 play. In a conference without a single Top 25-ranked team, parity comes to the Trojans’ advantage when vying for an NCAA championship bid.
This weekend, the Trojans have a chance to secure their first road win of the season and knock off the top-ranked team in the conference — the Huskies  are undefeated in Pac-12 play and 16-4 overall. Washington has been decisive in their victories, most recently stomping Oregon State 79-69 and Oregon 61-56, and they have yet to drop a loss at home.
The Huskies have already notched five double-digit wins in conference play, led by freshman guard Jaylen Nowell, who averages 17 points per game. The teams face off on Wednesday night, offering the Trojans an opportunity to mar the Huskies’ perfect conference record and take the top conference spot.
The team will then head to Pullman to face Washington State on Saturday. While their in-state rivals have dominated the Pac-12, the Cougars have had far less luck, notching only one win in conference play and going 8-12 overall so far this season. The team’s lone win came in an 82-59 victory over Cal, the winless bottom team in the league, with junior forward Robert Franks ripping off 24 points to lead the win.
Franks is the team leader in points, averaging 21.2 per game this season, while freshman forward CJ Elleby also adds 16.1 points per game. The rest of the roster averages under double-digits apiece, hefting most of the offensive burdens on the pair of forwards. For the Trojans, the game is a must-win, both to continue the team’s momentum and to separate itself from the bottom tier of the conference.
The Trojans’ recent success has been supported by an even balance of offensive production — at least five players have dropped double-digits in the last three games. On any given night, forwards junior Nick Rakocevic and senior Bennie Boatwright can drop over 20 points. But the team has struggled on the road, going 0-4 outside of Galen Center so far this season. Notching two wins on the road would give the team a shot at the top of the conference and the confidence to continue to travel as the Trojans enter the heart of the season.
Washington will host USC on Wednesday at 8 p.m.

For a while now, I’ve been trying to condition myself to enter bookstores without making purchases my bank account tells me I should probably forgo. I am successful for the most part, but sometimes — when I find a gorgeous vintage cover or a discount I can’t turn down — I capitulate to my book-gluttonous tendencies. 
Last week, during my most recent visit to The Last Bookstore in downtown Los Angeles, a most singular and brilliant book caught my eye: “Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland with artwork by Yayoi Kusama.” I gasped audibly, deliberated for minutes, then bit the bullet and bought the book. 
According to my bemused parents, I spent a spell of my childhood watching Disney’s “Alice in Wonderland” as many as three times a day (in retrospect, the film is chock-full of disturbing, drug-fueled imagery I’m surprised didn’t scar me as a kid). 
But regardless of whether I psychologically repressed certain scenes, “Alice in Wonderland” is one of those stories that’s stuck with me through the years and taught me to see the world through rose-colored glasses. 
Eighty-nine-year-old Japanese artist Kusama is known for doing the same. Best known for her “Infinity Mirrored Room,” the woman nicknamed the Princess of Polka Dots said she turned to art as an escape from a rare mental illness that has caused her to see colorful fields of dots and flashes of light since childhood. Although her works represent visions from her inner mindscape, they appear as abstractions to everyone else. With Carroll’s writing similarly tapping into the psyche of the creator, his words and Kusama’s art are a match made in heaven.
Both literally and artistically, her vision is inherently mind-bending in a way that comes to perfectly embody Carroll’s fascination with fantasy. There is something quite haunting about how effortlessly their two hallucinogenic, all-encompassing styles complement one another. Her images are interspersed throughout the text, which playfully experiments with boldness and size to create a surreal clarity and unapologetic vivacity. 
The joint project is a masterpiece. Disorienting, foreboding spirals accompany readers as Alice contemplates whether her dizzying plunge down the rabbit hole will ever come to an end. A two-page spread of hypnotizing monochromatic patterns repeated to infinity immediately follow the moment Alice finishes the little bottle labeled, “Drink me.” 
Psychedelic mushrooms blossom across the pages of her encounter with the Caterpillar. An explosion of neon abstraction, fearful yet mesmerizing, jumps out of the page upon the Queen’s command, “in a voice of thunder.” Kusama’s art also stunningly captures the feelings of confusion, panic, defeat and triumph that Carroll’s storytelling explores. 
The final page of the book, a flap of vivid yellow mottled with dots, bears a declaration: “I, Kusama, am the modern Alice in Wonderland.” It’s bold and sweeping, but the parallels between Kusama and Carroll’s heroine are undeniable. 
Her iconic surrealist imagery overtakes every page, so the themes of the story are rendered larger than life. Flipping the pages, the reader is compelled to descend into madness and chaos right alongside our two protagonists, Alice and Kusama, while watching the world contort through their eyes.
At its core, “Alice in Wonderland” is universal because it is concerned with the way adults still have the ability — in dreams or at their most open-minded — to see things the way children do. Kusama’s art attempts to recreate a sense of infinity just as Carroll contends that there are no limits to the human mind, no restraints on imagination. Most importantly, their combined work reminds us that the state of seeing the world with childlike wonder never has to end, just as it hasn’t for Kusama or Carroll. 
Perched proudly on my bookcase, it’s a good reminder for me, too, of how places like bookstores and art museums are my Wonderland.

Each year, queer voices and stories take on an increasingly prominent role in the music industry. While pop mainstays like Halsey and Troye Sivan continue to push portrayals of the queer experience to the masses, subversive acts like Brockhampton and King Princess are expertly telling historically undermined stories on an unprecedented scale.
With his debut album and subsequent tour, singer-songwriter Ryan Beatty is working to continue his upward trajectory and inject his own creative perspective into the fiber of the music industry. Drawing heavily from influences like Frank Ocean and The Internet, Beatty has laid the groundwork for what could be a greatly fruitful career. His debut “Boy In Jeans” displays talent and charisma, a mere taste of the performer within Beatty. His performance at the Moroccan Lounge on Jan. 28 was another sign that the R&B/alt-pop artist is just about to take flight.
The show opened with a euphoric rendition of the opener “Haircut,” an anthem made for the larger scale of a live show, which showcased Beatty’s emotionally raw vocals. Subsequent performances of “Money” and “Camo” benefited just as much from the live performances, with the live instrumentation providing justice to Beatty’s excellent recordings. Accompanied by a drummer, guitarist and bass player, Beatty expanded on the world of the album and produced a tangible performance atmosphere distinct from many other up-and-coming artists. Despite a few unavoidable technical mishaps, the production was superb.
Beatty carefully weaved in moments of intimacy throughout the production. The track “Party’s Over” notably showcased his emotions, which Beatty himself said was “hard to sing.” The song details infatuation that remains unreciprocated, artfully conveying a longing for connection through Beatty’s emotive delivery and haunting lyrics.  
The show itself seemed destined for a small audience. The stage did not allow for much smoke and mirrors, but the rectangular LED screen was all Beatty needed to create the perfect ambiance for each song. 
Aside from  the sound quality, it was Beatty’s connection to his audience that made the show memorable. Beatty’s shy nature combined with his quiet self-assuredness is a refreshing change of pace from the big personalities seen on top-40 world tours. His laid-back attitude and approachability allowed the audience to connect with his words on a deeper level. 
Though undoubtedly shy, Beatty expressed his gratitude to the audience and eventually revealed his more playful personality. At the end of the show, he reflected on his journey back to the Los Angeles stage, ironically blessing himself in prayer and more seriously conceding how much more comfortable he has become in his own skin. 
The set closed with a strong performance of “Flash,” a fitting end to a show that featured a range of emotions and resilience. The conclusive track relates the fleeting nature of life and its uncontrollably rapid pace. A homage to his father, the song gained new meaning in the eyes of the audience, who was surely not ready for Beatty to leave the stage. 
While the brash, visceral electronically influenced stage production was incredible, it was Beatty’s raw vulnerability that made the set so wonderful.

USC is one of the most influential universities in California. In 2017, an independent economic impact study conducted by Beacon Economics found that USC generated $7.4 billion in economic output in Southern California, spent $3.7 billion in the state, spent $514 million on capital projects in Los Angeles County and generated $37.9 million for the local economy as a result of USC events. USC directly employs over 53,000 people throughout California. The University is influential, but even then, it still isolates its students from the local community. 
The University has put effort into promoting Los Angeles Metro ridership among  students in the past, but most attempts have been ineffective. The Graduate Student Government is currently piloting a “U-Pass” program for its constituents, and some Undergraduate Student Government presidential tickets mentioned a discounted Metro pass program as an important platform point in the upcoming USG elections.
USG has seen numerous proposals for a U-Pass program, but these pose an internal issue as meetings with GSG, the Department of Transportation and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority rarely seem to end. Proposals for discounted Metro passes have been recurrent among USG candidates for years. Last year, five senatorial candidates included proposals in their platform, while this year three of 20 senatorial candidates did.
Though community isolation extends deeply into L.A., one of the immediate methods that could address this is the introduction of a program in partnership with the City of L.A. and Metro that offers discounted transportation, access to local museums, cultural events and more. 
USC recently altered integral aspects of the local community with the introduction of USC Village, which led to the closure of Superior Grocers and several other businesses that were connected to the local community and offered fair prices and services. They expressed what USC should aim to become: a tight-knit community of both students and the local community. 
However, hefty price tags and student-targeted retail seem far from intended “meaningful community benefits” as promised in USC Village’s mission statement. This is a stark contrast to U.S. Census Bureau data of the surrounding area’s over-$23,000 median household income — far under the 2017 estimation of California’s over-$69,000 median household income.   
In the University’s mission statement, there is a clear call to action regarding “respect and appreciation for others.” However, according to Washington Monthly’s college guide and rankings, USC ranks 192nd among national universities in the category of service, defined as how much a university encourages its students to give back to their communities and to the country. The University’s superficial intents to break down barriers, without tangible action, makes its mission statement meaningless.
Even though students can benefit from free Lyft at night in areas near University campus, the Metro system extends far and wide — almost 100 miles of service. The large price difference between public transportation and Lyft further underlines the need for discounted Metro passes. A ride from USC to Santa Monica costs anywhere from $20 to $30 one-way depending on traffic and peak times with Lyft, while Metro takes the same amount of time and costs $1.75 one-way. Metro’s large expanse would also encourage local students to attend USC by putting forth the idea of affordability and ease-of-use regarding commute time.
Many universities across the United States already offer U-Pass programs and enhance them by establishing incentives for civic engagement. Rice University offers free Metro cards and a “Passport to Houston” program that provides free access to local museums and more, all accessible by the public transport covered by Rice’s provided Metro cards. Even in L.A. 15 other colleges provide U-Pass programs. 
At USC, there has been little update or clarity on whether or not GSG’s program will be expanded. The program also requires an additional $105.50 fee on top of the included programming fee, possibly discouraging some potential customers. 
If USC encourages its students to use public transport, it would also help promote the city’s efforts to expand Metro, perhaps even shifting public opinion of the viability of public transit. 
The power that USC holds is immense, and it should use this power to support use and expansions of public transportation. By increasing the mobility of USC students and cultivating further civic engagement, the University will be doing its part as a member of the L.A. community. Encouraging public transportation is socially and environmentally friendly and benefits both USC students and the city.

Eight years ago today, my dad was killed in a car accident. 
While my life has changed in innumerable, inexplicable ways, one of the biggest changes is that I’ve become much more aware. Aware of my limited time on Earth. Aware of the beauty of our planet. Aware of my impact on this pale blue dot. 
Every day, I think about how to live the most sustainable life. I think about how my minute choices will impact the world beyond what I see up close. I spend embarrassingly large amounts of time researching the smallest things, trying to make sure I’m limiting my carbon footprint as much as possible.
But the solution for sustainable death is up in the air. It’s hard to find the sustainable option for your body once you’re done using it — traditional burial, cremation, some magical third solution — are all up in the air.
Traditional burial is incredibly harmful to the environment. Before burial, the body is embalmed — drained of any fluids and filled with toxic chemicals like formaldehyde, which are used to preserve the body and keep it looking “life-like” for open-casket ceremonies. Most bodies are embalmed, regardless of whether or not the family plans to have an open-casket funeral. 
Traditional caskets are made of thick, impermeable wood and metal rendering themnearly impossible for to properly decompose. Traditional cemeteries require a reinforced concrete vault around the casket to aid with the weight of heavy lawnmowers used to keep cemetery grass uniform. The grass requires large amounts of water, and cemeteries often use pesticides to keep it green.
When the body does decompose, the toxic embalming fluid goes with it. A study published in the Berkeley Planning Journal found that over 800,000 gallons of embalming fluid, primarily formaldehyde, soak into the soil every year in the U.S.
Cremation is not exactly a greener alternative — it uses fossil fuels to incinerate the body. Bodies are burned for two to three hours, releasing hundreds of pounds of carbon dioxide into the air. Dental fillings are also melted, releasing toxic mercury emissions as well, unless the crematory has a filter on its chimney. 
But cremation is becoming more and more popular in this country. The number of people who are cremated has risen from 40 percent to 47 percent between 2010 and 2015, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. And it’s only projected to become more popular in the coming years. 
Cremation is usually a less expensive alternative to the traditional burial, which could factor into its growing popularity.
But when it comes down to it, neither traditional burial nor cremation is exactly great for the environment. Despite these common options, burial doesn’t have to be unsustainable. 
The “green burial” is an increasingly popular option. In a “green burial,” the body is not embalmed. It is buried in a biodegradable casket, made of wicker, seagrass or another natural material. The body can also be shrouded in a cloth made of organic material and buried without a casket of any kind. 
Green burials are becoming more popular, possibly due to the growing awareness of our collective impact on the planet. Jim Olsen, a spokesperson for the National Funeral Directors Association, said he doesn’t like to call it a trend.
“It’s really nothing new,” Olsen told the Daily Trojan. “It’s simply just going back to the way that they’ve done it for thousands of years — hundreds of thousands of years.”
While green burials are a more environmentally conscious option, they are also a better option for the family, said Ed Bixby, president of the Green Burial Council, a nonprofit organization that sets a standard for what is considered a “green” or “natural” burial and holds providers to that standard.
“They come to us grief-stricken, rightfully so, and they leave with smiles on their faces, and that’s a really strange phenomenon,” Bixby told the Daily Trojan. “But, it’s not in the sense that if you could care for your dead as you would care for them in life … It’s a very different experience because that’s really all you want to do is give them what you feel is best. And being part of that, being hands on is life-changing.”
Green burials are better for the Earth and can be better for grieving families. 
The most sustainable option for your body is to allow it to return to the earth. From the earth we rise, and to it we shall return.
