Despite receiving a No. 23 ranking in the AP Poll this past week, the Trojans fell to the No. 17 Arizona Wildcats Sunday night, losing the game 86-78 on the road. 
With their eight-point loss to the Wildcats, the Trojans are now 3-5 on the road, 7-5 in Pac-12 play, 2-2 against teams inside the AP Top 25 and 18-7 overall. 
The Trojans, likely to be removed from the AP Top 25, have dropped consecutive road series against Pac-12 teams, losing two of three against UCLA, Oregon and Oregon State in January and now two games against Arizona State and Arizona by an average margin of 7.5. 
Sunday night’s loss represents the fifth time USC has lost by at least seven points, with their only close loss coming at the hands of the Washington Huskies. 
In their previous meeting this season at the Galen Center, the Men of Troy took down the then No. 7 Wildcats in quadruple overtime 103-101 in nail-biting fashion. This time around, however, the Trojans were not as lucky.
The game started out with an 6-0 run by the Wildcats, capped off by a Ryan Anderson layup to put Arizona ahead early. 
Eventually the Trojans would even the score at six, but would fail to maintain their close distance to the Wildcats in the first half as Arizona took a commanding 46-30 lead into halftime thanks to four completed three-pointers.
In the Trojans last contest against the cross-state rival Arizona State Sun Devils, turnovers ended up downing the Trojans in Tempe. Against the Wildcats, however, poor shooting and lack of defensive pressure cost the Trojans a potential victory.

The USC women’s basketball team edged past Washington State 64-62 Sunday night at the Galen Center to improve to 18-8 overall and 6-6 in Pac-12 Conference play. 
With 19.2 seconds on the clock, junior Courtney Jaco spun the ball in her hands, toeing the free throw line. Leading Washington State by only three points, she had the chance to knock down her 18th point of the night to cement a Trojans win. Jaco spun the ball one more time, then let the shot fly.
It sank with a resounding swish, drowned out by an emphatic cheer from the crowd and the bench. Washington State drove back for a layup, but time had run out. Jaco’s clutch free throw shooting gave the Trojans a redemptive victory at the end of a split weekend against two Washington teams. After falling to Washington 61-53 on Friday, the team found success in outside shooting and dominant post play against Washington State, a team they lost to earlier in the season.
“We recognized that we were a different team back then [four weeks ago] and we just didn’t play well,” head coach Cynthia Cooper Dyke said. “We were disappointed in that. Our number one goal today was to come out and show that that wasn’t us.”
Despite a late surge — including a three-pointer from forward Temi Fagbenle — to put USC within four points, the Trojans struggled to keep up offensively against Washington to start their weekend. The team battled back from deficits several time, but lacked the firepower to take over the lead.
While they weren’t able to get the offensive edge, aspects of the USC offense thrived against Washington. The team drained eight 3-pointers on the night, and Simon snatched a career-high 21 rebounds. But a combination of 16 turnovers and early foul trouble slowed the team’s offense too much to keep up with the high-powered Washington offense, led with 22 points from national scoring leader Kelsey Plum. 
With 26 points and 13 rebounds, Fagbenle notched her ninth double-double of the season, cementing the team in the post. Simon contributed an added six points, and put in necessary effort in the post to transition to a faster-paced style of defense against a guard-heavy Washington State team.
“It came down to putting in the effort necessary, and not quitting,” Simon said. “What we’d drilled in practice, we had to transfer that and we did a good job just grinding it out to the end.”
The second half was a back-and-forth battle for offensive momentum. The Trojans quickly stretched to a 10-point lead, but lost momentum slowly throughout the half as the Cougars chipped away. Washington State took the lead for several seconds late in the fourth quarter, but a 3-pointer from Jaco put the Trojans back on top. 
From there, Simon and Fagbenle erupted down low, but back-to-back field goals and a steal put the Cougars back within two points with less than 20 seconds left. A foul put Jaco on the line, where she drained both shots to seal the USC victory 64-62. 
“This season has been hard for me as far as my shooting goes,” Jaco said. “It felt good. It felt really good, in fact. We need to build on this because we can compete with anyone in our conference.”
The weekend was also a victory for the team’s push to support the Kay Yow Foundation, which raises money for breast cancer research. The topic is close to home for Cooper-Dyke, who was a player on Yow’s gold-medal Olympic team and whose mother passed away from breast cancer. Over the weekend, the organization raised over $1500 in funds.
“I told the girls to play for something more than themselves this weekend,” Cooper-Dyke said. “It has touched my life in many ways, and that’s why I wanted to encourage everyone to get out for the fight. That’s what this is — it’s a fight. We wanted to put that message out there that the battle isn’t over yet.”

The women’s swimming and diving team had a great Friday afternoon, defeating the Bruins 181-119 – Williams Ehart | Daily Trojan
The USC women’s swimming and diving team (8-2, 6-1) dominated in the pool Friday, capping off another successful regular season with a 181-119 victory against UCLA (6-4, 3-4) at the Spieker Aquatics Center.
Friday’s win gives the Trojans nine consecutive victories in dual meets against the Bruins, one short of their all-time win-streak in the series — USC defeated UCLA ten years in a row from 1994 to 2003.
“I am obviously proud of our team’s record,” USC’s tenth-year head coach Dave Salo said. “We knew they were going to come at us with everything they had, but we felt we would come away with a win.”
Though swim and dive meets consist of several different individual events, the victory was truly a team effort. USC’s “B” squad brought their A-game in the day’s opening event, when freshmen Hanni Leach, Kirsten Vose, junior Evan Swenson, and senior co-captain Lucy Worrall finished the 200-yard medley relay with a time of 1:38.27.
Vose wouldn’t stop there, as she broke the pool and meet records in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:44.07, a personal record. Her time was one of the fastest in the country, especially impressive because she has only swum this particular event a handful of times this season. Later in the day, she broke the meet and pool records in the 200-yard breaststroke.
Several other freshmen rose to the occasion alongside Vose: Elizabeth Stinson and Allie Wooden finished first and second, respectively, in the 1000-yard freestyle, and Madison Wright only missed a victory in the 200-yard butterfly by one-fifth of a second. Later, Destiny Nelson would take second place in the 200-yard backstroke and 400-yard individual medley. On the diving board, freshman Madison Witt led the charge for the Trojans, winning the 3-meter springboard and placing fourth in the 1-meter.
“We had some strong results from a lot of our kids,” Salo said. “We really showed a balanced effort to come away with the win.”
Junior Anika Apostalon was peerless in the sprints, winning the 50-and-100-yard freestyle races back-to-back. Senior Kasia Wilk finished second and third in those races, respectively.
The overall victory was never truly in doubt, but it wasn’t until senior co-captains Kendyl Stewart and Worrall delivered strong first and second place finishes in the 100-yard butterfly that the Trojans officially sealed the deal.
The Trojans would finish the meet the same way they started: with a commanding victory in a relay event. This time, the combined efforts of Apostalon, Swenson, Vose, and Wilk would be enough to beat UCLA by over a full second in the 200-yard freestyle relay.
With Friday’s victory, the Trojans improved their stock heading into the postseason, where they will once again face off with their toughest in-state rivals, Cal and Stanford.
“The women want to start a new streak,” Salo said. “We have a balanced team and can score a lot of points in every event … It will be a dog fight against Cal and Stanford, but the women are prepared and focused.”
USC won’t compete again until February 24th, when the Pac-12 championships begin in Federal Way, Washington, but the win against UCLA affords them some momentum moving into the competition. Depending on their performance in the conference championship, the Trojans may have the opportunity to take their prowess in the pool onto the national stage for the NCAA Championships, which begin in mid-March. USC last won a team NCAA title in 1985.
Of course. Fight on!
