It wasn’t how they expected the game to end.
For three quarters, the men’s water polo team kept a steady hand over Cal. Their lead wasn’t large, dipping from one point to two and back down to one. But heading into the fourth quarter of the NCAA championship on Sunday, the Trojans had a two-goal lead and a fresh dose of confidence. 
After dropping two straight championship games in bitter losses to UCLA, this was the year to avenge themselves.
But then, quite suddenly, it wasn’t. An early goal in the fourth quarter was followed by a quick shot off a power play. With 4:05 left in the game, the 5-3 lead had evaporated and the score was tied. Cal took the lead 30 seconds later, and the Trojans were left scrabbling to keep up.
They evened it up twice with goals from junior driver Blake Edwards and freshman two-meter Matt Maier. But a trip to overtime deflated the momentum and the confidence of the Trojans, who eventually fell 11-8 in their third-straight NCAA championship loss.
“We started the game great,” head coach Jovan Vavic said. “We had a really very focused and defense was excellent. Did a great job in the half court defense. And we really had the game in control until the last quarter.”
That final quarter displayed a lack of endurance and attention to detail that will haunt the Trojans until next season. The defense put on a brilliant show in the first three quarters, with junior goalkeeper McQuin Baron notching a career-high 19 saves, 11 of which came in the first half. But that defense became more sloppy as the Trojans relaxed entering the final quarter.
It’s the type of simple mistake that the Trojans don’t intend to make in the future.
“We really got to understand that these big games are not going to be given to you,” Vavic said. “You have to go out and get it. You have to work harder, focus harder.”
This is a position that the Trojans are used to — both being in the NCAA championship, and losing it late in the game. Vavic’s team has been in the past 12 championship games, an unprecedented streak for a college program. But his team has fallen apart in the final quarter for three years in a row, and that pattern is one that he hopes to break.
The match ended on a sour note, with Cal taking a three-goal lead and driving in the final goal with only six seconds remaining. But for a team that will only graduate one senior, the loss is only fuel to a fire that will keep burning until next year. Only minutes after the loss, players’ minds were already moving to the next game, the next season and the next championship.
“Overtime games are always challenging. Final games are always challenging,” junior James Walters said. “That’s the way sports go. We fell short. We need to go back and take a look at everything and train for next year.”

As his team swarmed onto Avaya Stadium in San Jose on Sunday night to the tune of the final whistle, head coach Keidane McAlpine watched from the sidelines, grinning.
The players bounced on their toes, hands scrabbling to touch the wood of the program’s second NCAA trophy, pulling each other in for hugs. But McAlpine took his time, walking slowly to touch his first championship trophy. 
In three seasons, McAlpine had turned a team that couldn’t make the playoffs into a squad that stormed into this year’s tournament and emerged champions. He drew in six transfers and turned them into a cohesive unit of leaders. And he created an environment of Trojan soccer that lives and breathes to do one thing — win.
“You plan a lot of things,” McAlpine said. “And you have to ride the ups and downs along the way. This group was a special group from day one, when we set foot on campus. And the three-year plan – it’s nice to see the end.”

The Trojans’ 3-1 victory over West Virginia on Sunday was a story with many parts — a defense that weathered a relentless Mountaineer attack, a pair of seniors who refused to allow a loss, a goalkeeper who carried the weight of a championship on her back. But mostly, it was the story of a team that decided to win the NCAA championship three years ago and, since then, hasn’t looked back.
The game itself was a grind from beginning to end. In the second minute, freshman Julia Bingham curled a ball to the top of the box and senior Savannah Levin headed a pass towards the mouth of the goal. Senior Morgan Andrews leaped into the air to flick the ball into the net and the Trojans took an early lead, confidences high as they jogged back to midfield.
But from there, West Virginia attacked intensely, outpacing the Trojans on the attack and levelling 21 total shots. The pressure forced senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme to make eight saves, coming off her line to snatch passes out of the air and diving to block point-blank shots.
In comparison, the Trojans only shot eight times. But they took their shots and their opportunities where it mattered the most.
“We were unified,” McAlpine said. “We’ve talked about our team defending [since] day one. We defend so we can attack. We’ve always been able to create chances and we’ve been very opportunistic all year. Today was no different.”
After West Virginia retained the ball and the momentum for most of the first half, the Trojans began to balance the rhythm by building plays out of the backline. But in the 66th minute, a steal and a quick finish evened the score.

It was redshirt senior Katie Johnson who gave up the steal. She blamed herself for the goal, for the even score, and decided it was her job to make sure the Trojans only came home as champions.
“I put a lot of responsibility on myself,” Johnson said. “I decided, ‘Okay, I need to get this back.’ Honestly, I just want to win, that’s all I care about. I’m just glad that we could win, that we could get the national championship, because I really believed that we could do it today.”
Less than ten minutes later, sophomore Leah Pruitt powered through two defenders and muscled her way into open position just outside the box. Johnson sprinted to a wide open backside, one hand pointed at the goal. When the pass came, she only needed a step and a glance before slotting the ball into the net.
The goal gave the Trojans every ounce of momentum they needed. West Virginia kept attacking, but Prudhomme and her defense stepped up at every moment, keeping the Mountaineers wide and disrupting the ball when it entered the box.
But that wasn’t enough for Johnson. And when senior Nicole Molen slotted a pass through the backline with only three minutes left on the clock, Johnson chased the ball down, shrugged off a defender and slammed a shot into the net.
The rest of the game was a celebration for the Trojans, as the bench held each other back, waiting for the final whistle, for their first seconds as national champions.

It’s not the program’s first NCAA trophy, and if McAlpine keeps up this pace, it won’t be its last. But this team has always been focused on more than just putting the ball in the back of the net, and that moment meant more than just a new piece of hardware for Heritage Hall.
Three years ago, this team lost eight of 20 regular season games. They weren’t even considered for the playoffs, not to mention a top-ten NCAA ranking. They didn’t have a coach or much of a plan, and the players doubted themselves, their team and their futures.
“We were very down on ourselves,” said senior Mandy Freeman, thePac-12 Defender of the Year. “We were in a bad place, coming from the coaching staff, individual players, just the type of environment that we were playing in.”
McAlpine came into the program with a three-year plan that was simple. First, they would have a winning season. Then they would make it to the tourney. Then they would win the whole thing. Most importantly, he wanted the team to have a good time while doing it.
Three years later, that transformation is complete.
“To have Keidane come in and completely change the culture, that was one of the biggest things,” Freeman said. “We focused on being better teammates, being competitive and bringing a good atmosphere to practice, on and off the field. I think that was our major selling point of getting this far into the season.”
Each player, in their own time, has experienced their own form of transition. Three years ago, Prudhomme was ready to quit soccer. She felt uncomfortable, uncertain of herself in her role at Oregon State. Over two years that had manifested into hating the game itself.
But she heard about a new coach at USC who had a plan to start winning. And Prudhomme believed in him, believed that by her senior year she could be a national champion. So she made the transfer, sat out a year, and bought into the program. 
Two years, later she is Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Year, holding the school record for shutouts along with her rank as a national champion.
On Sunday night, Prudhomme held her replica trophy in both hands, placing it neatly on the table in front of her as she sat down for the post-game press conference.
“In case you guys were wondering what this looks like,” she said, readjusting the trophy so that the overhead lights glinted off its surface.
When asked how it felt to be a national champion, she answered with a grin.

“I’m just so happy right now,” she said breathlessly, tugging at her NCAA champion hat with one hand.
Prudhomme wasn’t the only one who was stuck in a rut three years ago. Five other players transferred from schools that just didn’t fit. Freeman and her fellow seniors stuck it out, even when they didn’t know if they could trust McAlpine and his lofty goals. And Johnson lost all of last year to an ACL tear that she played through during her junior season, spending this season proving that she was still every bit as important to the team.
They’ve come a long way — from the team that couldn’t break .500 three years ago, that earlier this season described themselves as a group of “misfits” just looking for a chance. 
But as the Trojans left Avaya Stadium in baggy champion t-shirts, clutching their replica trophies, one thing was beyond clear.
Three years have made all the difference.

A season that began for USC with a stinker against Alabama will end with the Trojans smelling sweet roses. 
In a turnaround few could have predicted, No. 9 USC will play in the Rose Bowl against No. 5 Penn State on Jan. 2 after starting the season 1-3.
“We are tremendously excited and proud to be invited to the 2017 Rose Bowl,” head coach Clay Helton said. “It is a great honor for our team to have the opportunity to represent our university and the Trojan Family in the Rose Bowl, a bowl in which we have such a long tradition.” 
The Trojans ended the regular season on an eight-game win streak, enough for the College Football Playoff Committee to place them higher than Colorado — which is 10th — in the final rankings. USC is also ranked ahead of Colorado in the final AP Poll at No. 9, while the Buffaloes are No. 11.
“We are extremely thankful for the invitation,” Helton said. “It is a great reward for our football team after a very strong finish to the 2016 season.”
USC entered the weekend ranked 11th in the country, needing to leapfrog the eighth-ranked Buffaloes to become the highest-ranked Pac-12 team and earn a berth to Rose Bowl. But Colorado’s 41-10 loss to Washington in the Pac-12 Championship game gave the committee enough reason to drop the Buffaloes beneath the Trojans. 
In an interview with ESPN, playoff committee chair Kirby Hocutt called USC “one of the most impressive teams in the country” and said the committee spent a “considerable” amount of time deciding between USC and Colorado for the Rose Bowl bid.
In doing so, it put the USC back in the Rose Bowl for the first time since 2009, when it also faced Penn State in a 35-24 win. The teams also played in the 1923 Rose Bowl, which was the first postseason appearance for both programs. 
This snaps an eight-year Rose Bowl drought, which is tied for the longest in school history. The Trojans have historically dominated this bowl; this will be their record 34th appearance in the game. They have also made the Rose Bowl in the last 14 U.S. Presidential terms, with President Barack Obama now joining the list. 
USC is 24-9 in its Rose Bowl history. It is the most wins by a school in a single bowl.
This appearance came after a stunning mid-season run that saw the Trojans jump from the bottom of the Pac-12 to a top-10 ranking nationally. The success coincided with Helton making a quarterback switch from redshirt junior Max Browne to redshirt freshman Sam Darnold. Darnold led the Trojans to an 8-1 record after taking over, putting together one spectacular performance after another and changing the tone of the season.
The Trojans finish as the second highest-ranked team in the Pac-12 behind No. 4 Washington, which will play No. 1 Alabama in the College Football Playoff.
Kickoff on Jan. 2 will be at 2 p.m. from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.
“We congratulate Coach Franklin and the Penn State football team on their outstanding season and look forward to what should be a fun and compelling bowl matchup,” Helton said. “We can’t wait to see the Trojan Family in Pasadena on January 2.”
USC should be excluded from Rose Bowl as Miami Hurricanes should be excluded from Orange Bowl. It is 100% wrong for any team to get a home bowl game… By any rational standard USC should be playing at Happy Valley for the Rose Bowl. USC earned nothing yet is only team in the Country with home bowl game. It’s embarrassing, ridiculous, and a shame to the Fans of Penn State. Stadium will be 90% USC fans… Why doesn’t the NCAA & College Football Playoff Committee want a level playing field for all teams? Sad, but they care less about the kids, fans, and or the game. Money is only thing that matters… I’d love to see Penn State refuse to play in the game just to stick it to the NCAA & Bowl Committee. By the way, Penn State at # 5 is the right place for their team as they did not deserve to be in final 4 playoff matchup. But to penalize them w/ giving home field to their opponent is outrageous. Only real way to handle this is to beat USC at their home field and then publicly rip to shreds the entire Bowl process as unprofessional, biased, and without any sense of fairness, and providing no equal standards for any and or all the teams. Penn State has never ever played any Bowl Game at home. USC has played at HOME 33 times in Bowl games for Christ Sake. It’s outrageous and should NEVER EVER be allowed.At a minimum Penn State University should receive 75% of all profits from the Rose Bowl game at Pasdena and thus be rewarded w/ USC fan base money as clearly PSU was given the short end of the stick by making Nittany Lions travel across the Country.
