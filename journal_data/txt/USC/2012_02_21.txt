David Campbell, an associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame and co-author of American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us, discussed on Tuesday how American views toward religion in politics have changed since the ’60s and how this could influence presidential contender Mitt Romney’s campaign.
The USC Department of Political Science and Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies hosted Religion in a Time of Politics: Is This the Mormon Moment? Will Mitt Romney Be the Mormons’ JFK? in the Davidson Conference Center.
Campbell shared findings from the study conducted to write American Grace and what elements of political life have changed since John F. Kennedy was elected president.

Mormons today face similar problems to Roman Catholics in the ’60s in terms of their perception, Campbell said.
“In 1960 there were a lot of Americans who never had exposure to Catholics,” Campbell said. “Catholics went to different schools and lived in different neighborhoods.”
While Americans like religious diversity, he said, they trust people from another faith when they have a close relationship with someone who practices that faith.
“There is an immense amount of data supporting that Americans get along across religious lines because we have made relationships with people of other religions,” Campbell said. “They have either neighbors, close friends or extended family members of a different religious background.”
Campbell found that those of other religions viewed Jews, Catholics and Protestants most favorably. The least popular were Mormons, Buddhists and Muslims.
“This cannot simply be explained by the size of the group of the population,” Campbell said. “There are as many Mormons in America as there are Jews.”
His study found Mormons are one of the least likely religious groups to interact with those of other religions.
“Mormons are geographically concentrated in the mountainous West,” Campbell said. “They are less likely to have friends and family members in other religions and that works against them.”
Jordan Hatch, a graduate student studying dentistry and a Mormon, said about half of his friends are from his church and half are from school. He said his friends from school are usually not Mormon.
“They say they’ve never met a Mormon and ask me a lot of questions to clarify,” Hatch said. “It’s always been a very positive exchange.”
Campbell’s study found that those who did not know anything about Mormons were likely to look past religion when told about Mormonism, but those who had Mormon acquaintances were not.
“Those who have a Mormon acquaintance — know a Mormon but only in passing — are most likely to have a negative reaction to knowing Romney is a leader in the Mormon church,” Campbell said. “We hypothesize that’s because these folks know there’s something different and distinctive about Mormons but they haven’t been able to forge the close personal connection … that we have done with Catholics and Jews.”
Zade Shakir, a sophomore majoring in international relations and a Muslim, said Campbell’s findings were true for him.
“I have some close friends who are Mormon,” Shakir said. “I really respect their religion.”
Campbell said religion has become partisan, as frequency of religious service attendance is the largest indicator of whether someone is a Republican, which puts Romney in a more difficult situation than Kennedy.
“He can’t stand before an audience like Kennedy did and say, ‘Don’t worry about my religion,’” Campbell said. “We expect our presidential candidates, and especially the Republican base, to discuss their religion explicitly.”
Though the Church of Latter-Day Saints spent money promoting Proposition 8, which ended same-sex marriage in California, Campbell said the Mormon church rarely takes political positions.
“There are far fewer specific statements made by church leaders that could be construed as political,” Campbell said. “The LDS church really does make a policy of staying out of politics.”
He said Romney being the Republican nominee could effect a change in the perception of Mormons similar to the one Kennedy brought about for Catholics.
“If the Romney candidacy leads Americans to have a conversation about religion — even if at times it will be painful, especially within the Mormon community … in the long run we will be better as a nation,” Campbell said. “We will have a better understanding of those from a different religion.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety daily incident report log between Saturday, Feb. 18, and Monday, Feb. 20.

Crimes against property
At 1:31 p.m. on  Feb. 18, retail unit officers observed a student who works at the Pertusati University Bookstore pick up two packages of food and place them in his backpack. At the end of his shift, the student left the store without paying for the merchandise and he was detained by the officers. The student agreed to pay for the merchandise and he was released after being advised that the matter would be referred to Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 6:20 p.m. on Feb. 20, DPS officers responded to a report of a student and a non-USC female involved in a dispute at University Gateway. The student told the officers that the female is the mother of one of his roommates and her continual presence in their apartment has created an uncomfortable living environment for him and his other roommates. Building security was able to locate temporary housing for the female and her son until the situation is resolved and the officers cleared the scene without further incident.
at 5:49 p.m. on Feb. 20, a student filed a complaint regarding the on-going rude behavior of a subject he believed to be a staff member toward students and others who use Cromwell Field. DPS officers determined that the subject is not a staff member, but a volunteer for the athletic department and they counseled him about his behavior.
at 3:39 p.m. on Feb. 19, DPS officers responded to a report of a staff member and a non-USC female filming without permission inside a room at Keck Hospital of USC and refusing to leave the premises after being asked to do so. The officers contacted the subjects and they were unable to produce any documentation authorizing their use of the room. Both subjects left the room without further incident.
King,  Your Mom coming by once a week or so to pick-up laundry and change the sheets is one thing.  When she moves in full-time and starts walking around the apartment in a faded and torn over-sized 80s Derby Days sweat shirt without any pants under, I start having a problem.   She truly crossed the line when she brought that neanderthal Pike back from the 9-0 who kept us up all night with his grunts and other primal love sounds.  I had no choice but  to call DPS when I found her wandering around the apartment early in the morning with a natty light and cigarette asking where her boyfriend Jake had gone…
My mom was keeping that apartment spotless and my ungrateful roommates are just jealous as my mom is way hotter than theirs…

Students elected Mikey Geragos and Vinnie Prasad to serve as Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president, respectively, in the 2012-2013 school year.
All smiles · Vinnie Prasad (left) and Mikey Geragos (right) were unofficially named vice president and president of the Undergraduate Student Government. Both Geragos and Prasad have served as USG Senator pro tempore. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
Geragos, USG director of university affairs, and Prasad, USG Senator pro tempore, received 2,376 votes, winning by a nearly seven-point margin. The presidential ticket of Jared Ginsburg, USG director of campus affairs, and Samantha Coxe, a Greek senator, placed second with 1,992 votes. The ticket of Theo Offei and Julia Riley garnered 960 votes.
Geragos said he plans to work with current USG President Monish Tyagi and USG Vice President Logan Lachman to ensure a smooth transition between administrations. Elected USG officers will be sworn in early April.
“I’m going to take tonight off,” Geragos said. “But after that I’m going to sit down with Monish and start going over all of the transition things we need to hit. I feel like it’s really important I get up to speed on everything so we can hit the ground running.”
Geragos said one priority for his administration is improving on-campus dining.
“That’s been a big thing,” Geragos said. “I got a lot of responses for that [during the campaign] from students who wanted it to get fixed, so I’ll definitely be focusing on that.”
Tyagi said Geragos and Prasad’s USG experience will allow them to work effectively in their new positions.
“They both have a lot of experience in USG,” Tyagi said. “That’s going to bode really well for them going into next year.”
Tyagi said the winners should channel their energy from the campaign into their new positions in USG.
“It’s a lot of work ahead of them,” Tyagi said. “It might feel like this is the end, but it is just the beginning of a very memorable year. But I know if they approach this next year with the same amount of dedication as they approached this campaign, they will keep moving USC forward.”
USG co-directors of elections and recruitment Elise Fabbro and Kelly Hann announced the results of the presidential and senatorial races during a USG Senate meeting in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. More than 75 students attended the meeting in anticipation of the results.
Students cast 5,546 ballots in the election, nearly a 200-ballot drop from last year’s contest, in which 5,741 students participated. Hahn attributed this decrease to the intermittent rain last week.
“Rain definitely influenced it,” Hahn said. “But we are happy with the turnouts.”
USG also announced the election of 12 Senate positions. No incumbents ran for re-election.
Sophomores Ryan Park, Matthew Arkfeld and Alexander Cascante were elected to serve as Greek senators.
Park said, as a senator, he plans to focus on creating an online calendar of Greek activities and on repairing the sidewalks on The Row.
The six winners of the residential senator election were junior Josh DeMilta, sophomore Maheen Sahoo and freshmen Jasmine McAllister, Emma Katz, Sona Shah and Sarah Loh.
“Our plans are to improve campus sustainability, the dining halls as well as housing facilities,” said Shah, who ran on a slate with Loh.
Juniors Adam Prohoroff, Vicken Antounian and Ani Tatintsyan were elected to serve as commuter senators.

The Women of Troy used a fast start to push past UCLA on Sunday. After falling behind 2-0 to start the game, USC went on a 14-3 run to take a lead that it would not relinquish, winning with a final score of 66-54.

Sophomore forward Cassie Harberts had a stand-out game, scoring 14 of her 26 points in the first half, including the team’s first seven, to go along with seven first half rebounds. She finished the game with nine rebounds.
“I do what my team needs me to do,” said Harberts. “Today, I was able to get a lot of low post touches and I was told to go at them. At the beginning, I was actually making my layups, which was great for me.”
USC (14-11, 8-6) used a full-court press to cause 14 UCLA turnovers that led to 13 of its 35 points heading into the locker room. The defense also caused turnovers by double-teaming UCLA’s post players and forcing them to make poor passes.
“[Doubling the post] was a major thing that we wanted to do,” said USC coach Michael Cooper. “Our Achilles’ heel has been points in the paint. We knew that to have a chance to win the game, we had to get the ball out of the low post and make them take tough shots from the perimeter.”
Another part of USC’s first half success was its ability to get to the free throw line. As a team, it shot 13-20 from the line, while the Bruins (12-13, 7-7) shot a mere 4-7.
Senior guard Briana Gilbreath recorded a double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds while shooting 2-3 from beyond the arc.
UCLA’s forward Markel Walker tried to keep her team in the game by recording a double-double of her own, but it was not enough as she was outplayed in the post by Harberts.
In the second half, the Bruins made a dent in USC’s lead with turnovers, which swelled to 23 at one point. USC had 16 second-half turnovers compared to just eight in the first half.
USC finished with 30 points in the paint compared to UCLA’s 26. The Women of Troy also out-rebounded the Bruins 48-37.
After being swept in the season series with UCLA last season, this year’s Women of Troy returned the favor by winning both match-ups this year.
The season sweep marks the first time that senior guards Ashley Corral and Gilbreath have swept their crosstown rivals.
“It feels great. To win against your crosstown rival means a lot,” said Gilbreath. “We were glad to sweep them for the first time in my career — it was amazing.”
The victory also moves USC out of a fourth-place tie with the Bruins and just half a game behind third-place Arizona State.
USC plays host to the Arizona schools this week, with Arizona playing at the Galen Center on Thursday and ASU on Saturday.

The No. 5 USC men’s swimming and diving team finished its regular season on a good note, beating Pac-12 rival Utah 157-138 on Saturday at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
The USC squad (4-3, 2-3)  was led by freshman Cristian Quintero, a spring semester addition who made his debut by winning the 500-yard and 1,650-yard freestyle. USC also started the meet with a win in the 200-yard medley relay, with junior Nick Karpov, freshman Sergio Lujan Rivera, junior Matt Voell and senior Jeff Daniels winning in 1:28.50. Utah finished second with a time of 1:29.42.
Quintero followed the opening win by dominating the 1,650-yard freestyle with a time of 15:02.59. His time was the 10th best in the NCAA this season, an NCAA “B” cut, and the 10th-fastest in USC history. Freshman Cary Wright took second with a time of 15:32.57.
USC next swept the 200-yard freestyle, with sophomore Mike Godbe (1:37.86), sophomore Jack Wagner (1:38.98) and junior Spencer Di Dio (1:40.63) finishing first, second and third, respectively.
Sophomore Vladimir Morozov won the 100-yard backstroke in 47.46 while sophomore Chase Bloch took second in 48.65. Utah junior Austin Fiascone finished third with a time of 50.39.
Utah junior Karson Applin won the 100-yard breaststroke in 55.32, with freshman Andrew Malone charging hard for second with a time of 55.76. Sophomore Blake Cushing finished third in 55.78.
Junior Justin DiFederico won the 200-yard butterfly in 1:45.70, a season-best effort that ranks in the top 15 nationally. Sophomore Dimitri Colupaev took second (1:47.08) while Voell finished third (1:54.80).
Utah’s Nick Soedel won the 50-yard freestyle in 20.13. Senior co-captain Jack Ostler was second (21.22), while Utah’s Alex Brown finished third (21.31). After the diving break, Soedel won again in the 100-yard freestyle (44.18). Karpov took second (45.61), while Utah’s Winter Heaven was third (45.63).
Freshman Chad Bobrosky led the 200-yard backstroke after 50 and 100 yards, with the Utes’ senior Major Robinson challenging in the middle of the race. Morozov took second after 150 yards, but Bobrosky had more than enough space to win in 1:46.16, an NCAA “B” cut. Morozov finished second in his first 200-yard backstroke of the season (1:47.66), and Wright snuck ahead of Robinson to finish third (1:49.07).
Quintero doubled up in the 500-yard freestyle to win in 4:24.00, posting his second NCAA “B” cut of the day. He was briefly overtaken by senior Julian Bonse, who ultimately finished second in 4:24.38, a personal record.
Applin claimed the 100-yard butterfly in 48.02 with Bloch second (48.42) and Godbe third (49.74).
In the diving pool, freshman Jordan Gear won the 3-meter with 330.30, edging Utah junior Nelson Foo (328.35). Gear would also finish second in the 1-meter (287.85), with Utah sophomore Caleb Herrick finishing first (293.10).
Junior Alex Lendrum, in his first 400-yard IM of the season, had little trouble in the off event, winning in 3:50.22, a top 25 time nationally, a “B”cut, and USC’s best time of the season. Di Dio took second (3:54.69), while senior Will Orlady was third (3:55.07).
USC closed the meet with a valiant effort in the 400-yard freestyle relay as Daniels, Morozov, Colupaev and Wagner won in 2:55.81, falling only .51 short of the 2006 pool record.

A big problem at any university is finding a way to maintain stability when it comes to marketing the faces of an athletic program.
USC is no exception.
Over the next 18 months, some of the finest athletes to ever don the cardinal and gold will walk up on a stage, receive their degrees and move on to the next phase in their lives.
USC’s current Mount Rushmore of athletic excellence will undergo a much-needed facelift once the likes of Matt Barkley, Briana Gilbreath, Joel Dennerley, Alex Jupiter, Steve Johnson, Tony Ciarelli and Andrew Triggs say their final farewells.
Fortunately, the search party won’t take long in finding their replacements.
Discovering the next university-based poster children can be arduous, because marketability isn’t just a matter of selling success on the field; it’s about showcasing the whole package.
Though their collective absence from this university will most certainly be felt in the coming years, the next potential crop of names to know are by no means second-rate fill-ins.
Although sophomore Nickell Robey, sophomore Robert Woods and freshman Marqise Lee have solidified their places as the next distinguished torchbearers for the USC football program, they are just a few of the athletes itching to take over the mantle in their respective sports.
The USC women’s tennis team is off to its best start since 1999, thanks in large part to a “Fab Four” of freshmen Zoë Scandalis, Sabrina Santamaria, Gabriella DeSimone and Giuliana Olmos, who have embraced and adapted to the collegiate ranks.
Despite their lack of previous experience at USC, these four have begun the season with a rare dose of confidence and sense of the moment. Because of their efforts, the Women of Troy reached the semifinals of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Team Indoor Championships earlier this month for the first time since 2003.
Bill Ferguson’s men’s volleyball team might have lost one of the best players last season in Murphy Troy, but they have not lost a step when it comes to on-court production. Ferguson will also have to replace Tony Ciarelli, who has helped guide the 2012 squad to a No. 6, when the current season concludes. But that replacement will likely come internally. Freshman middle blocker Robert Feathers might not play the same position, but he has the skill — he leads the nation in blocks per set — engaging personality and temperament to take over as the program’s future go-to guy.
If you didn’t have a chance to stop by Dedeaux Field last weekend, you missed out on a chance to see what could very well be the beginning of a revival of the USC baseball team.
Though only three games in, two of the gems that made up coach Cruz’s nationally lauded 2011 recruiting class already look to be pivotal figures for years to come. Catcher Garrett Stubbs is an instant spark plug at the plate, possessing the mindset and talent to be a key cog at the top of Cruz’s lineup.
And though freshman left-hander Stephen Tarpley only has one start under his belt, if Sunday’s nine-strikeout performance is any indication, this student-athlete has the makeup to be the next great USC hurler.
His poise on the mound and general enthusiasm for the game are apparent the minute you watch him take the field. It’s the kind of energy that rubs off on teammates in ways a third-strike fastball or timely out cannot.
Freshman Yannick Hanfmann played the role of the hero this weekend as the USC men’s tennis team captured the ITA Indoor Championship.
Freshman Cristian Quintero gave but a glimpse of what he’s capable of achieving in the pool this past week, as his two freestyle wins aided the Trojans’ swim and dive squad in its win over Utah.
Sophomore Sophia Popov fired a season-best round of 67 last week and has the No. 4 Women of Troy golf team firing on all cylinders.
These are just a few names that come to mind when evaluating the athletic program’s upcoming succession plans, but they are certainly not the only ones.
The named and unnamed all possess signs of athletic excellence, high moral character and an uncharacteristic ability to thrive despite what their age or experience may normally dictate.
But the true test will likely be found in the coming months and years. If they are to be the next faces to adorn the Coliseum or the Galen Center or Heritage Hall, they must also dedicate themselves outside the white lines to embody the five traits of a Trojan: faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous and ambitious.
It’s a test that if conquered goes well beyond some columnist’s fictional Mount Rushmore.
If conquered, these future faces will have a lifetime spot in the annals of USC history.

Wyatt Strahan is becoming a freshman fixture in the Trojans bullpen.
After dealing 2 1/3 scoreless innings over the weekend, including his first career win on Sunday, the freshman righty was again stellar on Tuesday night in Long Beach. Strahan shut out Long Beach State in both the eighth and ninth innings, facing just seven hitters to preserve the Trojans’ 4-2 victory over the Dirtbags and record his first career save.

“He’s one of our two closers right now,” said USC coach Frank Cruz of the freshman Strahan. “He’s done real well for us so far.”
What proved to be the winning run was a case of textbook case of good situational hitting. With the score tied and one out in the fourth, shortstop James Roberts stepped to the plate with runners on second and third. The sophomore knocked a ground ball to the second baseman, whose only play was to first, allowing senior rightfielder Alex Sherrod to score the eventual winning run from third and put USC up 3-2.
“He just put the ball in play,” Cruz said of Roberts. “That’s all he needed to do in that situation and that’s just what he did.”
USC was the first to strike. With two down in the second inning and Sherrod on second base, sophomore designated hitter Jake Hernandez smacked an RBI double to right to give the Trojans a 1-0 lead.
The Dirtbags came right back in their half of the second. With runners at the corners and two down, senior pitcher Brandon Garcia balked, tying the game and putting a runner on second.
An error once again put runners at the corners, and the next Dirtbags hitter capitalized with a knock to center to give Long Beach State a 2-1 lead.
But USC answered in the third, as senior catcher Kevin Roundtree came through with a clutch two-out RBI single to tie the game, and the Trojans took the lead on Roberts’ groundout in the fourth.
Meanwhile, Garcia was mowing down the Dirtbags on the mound, putting them down quietly in the third, fourth and fifth, before being removed after allowing a two-out single in the sixth.
All told, Garcia went 5 2/3 solid innings, allowing two runs, one earned, on five hits with one walk and four strikeouts.
The USC bullpen was superb in relief of Garcia, using a combination of four pitchers to shut out the Dirtbags over the next 4 1/3 innings.
The Trojans added an insurance run in the eighth. Senior first baseman Matt Foat doubled with two outs, and then scored on two subsequent wild pitches to give USC a 4-2 lead.
USC threatened again in the ninth, but Foat hit into a bases loaded 4-6-3 double play to end the inning.
All told, the Trojans stranded eight runners in the game, including at least one in every inning from the second through sixth.
That could be viewed as a positive: The only innings the Trojans went down in order were the first and seventh.
But runners left on base were a huge problem for the Trojans last year, and could come back to bite them at any time.
“It’s early,” Cruz said of both his team’s struggles and successes. “We’ve got a long season ahead of us and we’ll see how it plays out.”
But for now, the Trojans are 4-0. They will next put their perfect record on the line against 0-3 Akron this weekend at Dedeaux Field.

Although USC men’s tennis has been a consistent force in the Pac-12 and NCAA Championships in the last three years, it has been 24 years since the Trojans clinched the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Team Indoors Championship.
No match · Senior Daniel Nguyen (above) helped lead the No. 1 Trojans to their first win at the ITA Indoor Championship in 24 years. The Trojans have now won 30 matches in a row dating back to last February. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
The No. 1 Trojans (11-0) broke the dry spell by defeating No. 3 Ohio State (12-1) 4-3 on Monday in Charlottesville, Va., to win the Indoors for the first time since 1988.
With the score deadlocked at 3-3, No. 36 freshman Yannick Hanfmann sealed USC’s championship with a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over No. 65 Devin McCarthy in the Trojans’ closest match this season.
Ohio State jumped to a 1-0 lead after doubles, but No. 14 senior Daniel Nguyen and No. 47 sophomore Emilio Gomez erased the deficit with straight set singles wins.
The Buckeyes battled back, winning two of the next three in straight sets over No. 18 sophomore Ray Sarmiento and freshman Eric Johnson.
USC maintained a 3-2 lead after No. 11 senior Steve Johnson’s 6-3, 6-4 win over No. 16 senior Chase Buchanan, but Sarmiento’s subsequent loss to No. 12 Blaz Rola set the stage for Hanfmann’s comeback clincher.
“I have never been in that situation before. The pressure was huge, so I was relieved to get the break because I knew all I had to do was serve it out,” Hanfmann said. “I just told myself to stay calm and block out the crowd.”
The pair of Johnson and Hanfmann, nationally ranked No. 28 in doubles, had been undefeated in the season before losing 5-8 to Ohio State’s No. 1 pair of Buchanan and Rola.
Gomez and No. 86 freshman Roberto Quiroz followed with a narrow 8-9, 4-7 loss to Peter Kobelt and Connor Smith that gave the Buckeyes the 1-0 advantage, the only time USC has trailed this season.
“We just got punched in the face in doubles,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “I told them if you get punched in the face, you better get up and punch back. It was good to see the team compete as hard as they did.”
En route to the finals, USC had swept No. 20 Tennessee (4-6) and No. 10 Duke (9-1) before defeating No. 4 Georgia (8-1) in the semifinals.
The four wins in four days keep the Trojans undefeated this season and continue their 30 dual-match win streak spanning from last season.
USC relinquished only one point before the finals, which came from an early singles loss by Quiroz that tied the Georgia semifinals match at 1-1.
Wins by Hanfmann, Gomez and Johnson followed up the loss, giving USC its first ticket to the finals since 1991.
The Trojans will now return home to face No. 24 San Diego (5-2) and San Diego State (5-1) in a doubleheader on Friday, beginning with a clash against the Aztecs at 1 p.m. at Marks Tennis Stadium.

Last week, I talked about lighting. This week, let’s examine editing.
Editing is the process of selecting and combining shots into an overall work, at its most basic level.  Editing can be as simple as inserting a dissolve transition between two shots, but can also be so complex that it alters the meaning of a scene or an entire work.  It is often called “The Invisible Art” because a good editor will make a film so fluid that the audience will not be aware of the editing.
Editing has come a long way since film pioneers physically cut film strips and pasted them together. These days, advanced computer programs allow editors a range of expression and freedom never seen before.  Film editing has indeed become an art form, and one unique to film.
When an editor makes a cut, it can achieve several different effects.  A basic edit can serve to simply patch events together in a polished, chronological order.  If events are edited together out of chronological order, this can take the film in an entirely new direction—creating  a different meaning for the work.
Another editing technique that creates meaning is through juxtaposition of shots—or cross-cutting.  In this technique, the relationship between two shots—played one after the other—creates a new meaning.  For example, if we see a shot of a child lighting a match and then cut to a shot of a burning house, it leads us to believing the child may have started a fire.
Editing has become more complex, but it is also more accessible than ever.  Both PCs and Macs come with free editing software, and many professional programs offer significant student discounts.  Editing is an invisible art, but one that will become very visible if done wrong.  A good editor is needed to create a great work of art.
Check back every Tuesday for Timothy’s latest techniques in filming.

In the cozy microcosm of Los Angeles that is USC, one can easily forget how big this city is.
Sometimes, it takes the arrival of friends and family to drag you out of this patch of the Figueroa Corridor.
With no designated Trojan Family Weekend in the spring semester, your family might decide to visit anytime. Friends also visit often this time of year, whether it’s because of spring break or just for a casual drop-in.
The opportunity to leave the campus area is always enlightening. And as a diner, plans to explore Los Angeles beyond the USC bubble provide a glimpse into the city’s seemingly endless sprawl of restaurants.
Los Angeles is nearly unrivaled as a city in its variety of culturally diverse dining options. This is exemplified in meals from the outstanding pho from Pho87 on the outskirts of Chinatown to the vibrant Peruvian small plates at West Los Angeles’ Picca.
You’ll be doing lots of driving, but lots of learning, too — about the different groups of people that have flocked to Los Angeles, and the recipes that they brought with them.
When parents are in town, take advantage of the city’s upscale dining options. Sometimes beef fajitas and Diablo shots at La Barca just won’t do.
But deciding where to indulge in a pricier meal doesn’t come without caveat.
The year-old, increasingly hot restaurant Red Medicine turns out vaguely Vietnamese takes on root vegetables and pork. Their Brussels sprouts with Vietnamese fish sauce was blow-your-mind delicious, but a follow-up plate of chicken dumplings was mysteriously salty. A carefully plated order of winter peas with trout roe showed off creative textures, but the flavors from an accompaniment of soymilk-yogurt made the dish far too sweet. Basically, there was a miss for every hit.
Lesson learned: When visitors only get to enjoy one or two dinners a year in Los Angeles, you want a fine dining establishment that’s, well, established.
Bouchon in Beverly Hills is hard to beat, expensive but with more ambiance than many other options in the city, and a restaurant from one of the world’s most celebrated chefs, Thomas Keller. The red velvet banquettes and gleaming brass fixtures say Parisian bistro, but the lounge area and mile-high windows looking down onto a garden are distinctly Los Angeles.
Oh, and the food’s fantastic too. Roast chicken with hints of cranberry and orange, a selection of shellfish and a roasted leg of lamb all impress. When people describe a dining experience, this is what they mean.
There are no tricks here — no foams or flames, just classic and consistent dishes.
For visiting friends, totally different rules apply. You want these guests to see two scenes — one USC, one Los Angeles.
You should take these friends to La Barca. And take them to Cole’s Downtown and enjoy their self-proclaimed original French-dip sandwich; then enter their back-of-house speakeasy where bartenders can customize any drink to your preference.
Or take your friends to The Standard: Chances are they rarely get to follow up a midnight meal by lounging on rooftop poolside waterbeds.
No matter with friends or family, dining for fun is a joyous way to see the city — a celebration of taste and Los Angeles’ bounty of eateries.
Say your father is visiting and he loves doughnuts. You can start at a staple like Winchell’s, then get touristy with the famous doughnut-topped Randy’s in Inglewood. Finish at one of the new “healthier” purveyors of dad’s favorite pastry, such as West Hollywood’s baked-doughnut haven Fonuts or Downtown’s gluten-free temple Babycakes.
If a deli-fiend buddy flies in from New York, let him compare his hometown pastrami to the slices at Langer’s or Canter’s, a benefit of the latter being its 24-hour service. A Southern visitor might appreciate the deconstructed take on key lime pie at Son of A Gun, where toasted meringue rims the serving bowl.
In a food scene seemingly devoted to updating the classics, it’s fun for visitors to experience the new possibilities in lifelong favorites.
Or forget everything you’ve just read. When hungry, take your visitors to the most convenient hole-in-the-wall and hope for the best. Given the quality of food served in this city, you’re likely to be pleasantly surprised.
But no matter the means, you must experience the food and the city. To entirely debase the words of Ernest Hemingway: Los Angeles, too, can be a moveable feast.

Shearwater, a musically sophisticated band, has thrived over the years on subtlety and carefulness — measuring, controlling and distilling its sound like perfectionists. But now, with its seventh studio album, Animal Joy, the band has attempted to shed the cerebral in favor of the corporeal, relinquishing control for a sound connected more to the natural world and our animal nature.
Simple Shearwater · The on-the-rise indie-rock band takes a more basic approach in its latest release Animal Joy to let its lyrics shine. - Photo courtesy of Sub Pop Records
Animal Joy is a far cry from Shearwater’s last studio album, The Golden Archipelago, the orchestrated, celestial and shimmering final installment of the band’s Island Arc trilogy. Shearwater has scaled back this time around, shaking off an eclectic accompaniment of instruments in favor of a sound that’s minimalist, lean and tinged with primal energy. The absence of chamber-pop elements gives rise to the power of traditional drums, guitar and bass.
The sound is incredibly intricate, layered with haunting melancholy and intensity but without as much of the quiet grandness found in the band’s other albums. Animal Joy is spontaneously energized, and even though the sound is wilder and simpler, there is still a strong shade of old Shearwater meticulousness, especially in the lyrical imagery.
The album starts off with “Animal Life,” a poignantly passionate song filled with a simmering power that never bubbles over. The track rhapsodizes a connection to nature with the lyrics “Cast away like dogs from the shelter / that once collected radiance / Searching at the light’s perimeter / The half-remembered wild interior / Of an animal life!”
The rest of the album remains constant with the pro-nature and anti-construct theme, which draws metaphors about shedding constructed humanity as a snake sheds its own skin, especially with the recurring theme of leaving an old life.
The songs evoke trappings of modern society, such as houses, gates, photographs, batteries and the lottery, representing them as things that distance the human soul from what is truly important.
The jangly, lively “Immaculate” says “You’ll only get a look at your life when you’re leaving it.” And in “You As You Were,” singer Jonathan Meiburg croons more overtly: “You could drive the mountains down into the bay / Or go back to the east where it’s all so civilized / Where I was born to life / But I am leaving the life.”
In spite of the promising direction of the band’s new sound and the layered exquisiteness of “Animal Life,” the album begins to lose potency around the halfway mark.
The remaining songs aren’t bad, but they mostly restate what the first half explores. For instance, “Run the Banner Down” and “Pushing the River” are slow songs with rhythms and melodies that plateau, and on an album that relies on emotive yearning and insightful subtlety, redundancies simply do not work.
The second half of the album is saved by songs like “Open Your Houses,” in which the melody and Meiburg’s voice and lyricism mend a beautifully haunting quality: “I was still life / I was pinned inside of a photograph / When I realized / You had slipped outside of the scenery.”
Despite the album’s dedication to the primal, its appreciation of primitive sound creates a 21st century ode to the earthly: The heartache that comes through the music is rooted in the band’s cerebral nature. That’s not so much criticism as it is an observation; there is something tantalizing about the difficult attempt to connect to primal roots. Animal Joy, perhaps accidentally, highlights how we as human beings are so embedded in our “Roman machinery” and “half-remembered holidays” that we have forgotten how to connect to the natural world.
The true heart of this album lies within its incredible lyrics, a constant the band has preserved through the years. Though it’s not a perfect album, Animal Joy is an intriguing work and a good step in an experimental direction. It’s not as gritty as one would expect a “primal” album to be, but this is Shearwater, after all.
The band is still very much its old self, but now everyone’s a little louder and less tame.

As you walk up the steps of the Fisher Museum of Art, a glass door provides a backdrop for four large gray words spelling out “L.A. is 18% GRAY.”
Vision · Fisher Museum features progressive artwork, such as Judy Coleman’s “Crossed Hands” (left) and Sheila Pinkel’s two untitled works (right), in its ongoing exhibition Sight Specific: LACPS and the Politics of Community. - Eddie Kim | Daily Trojan
Because it hardly rains in Los Angeles, the statement hits the nail on the head. These curious words, however, refer not to the bipolar weather of the city, but to the idea of using an 18 percent gray card, a photographer’s tool to capture a specific amount of light. Emblazoned on a T-shirt, the phrase became the motto for the Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies, an organization started in 1974 to inspire photographic creativity and a sense of community.
Inside the walls of the Fisher Museum, decades later with the advent of new photographic technology, lies the history of the organization and photography as an art form.
Sight Specific: LACPS and the Politics of Community houses works from various shows put on by LACPS. As part of the Getty’s expansive Pacific Standard Time initiative, an effort to establish Los Angeles as a veritable art center in the post-World War II era, Sight Specific sheds light on a lost part of L.A. photography with works from 1974 to 1985. Planning began when the Getty awarded a grant to USC to take part in PST.
Curated by Tim Wride, the current William and Sarah Ross Soter curator of photographs at the Norton Museum of Art in Florida and formerly the Curator of Photography at LACMA, the show organizes specific sections set off by themes or individual artists, each with a clipboard and a piece of paper stating where and when the show took place. The show also presents binders that visitors can leaf through, along with relevant magazines and books.
Wride attempted to take a different approach to curating than that of other PST shows.
“Often what happens in PST is that there is a lot of recontextualizing of work that we know or work we thought we knew and it’s a lot of the same people in the same shows, just with a different edge to them,” Wride said. “What I was hoping to do was put together a show that concentrated first on the works of art and allowed their context then to actually manifest so that the ideas they were grappling with [would] become forefront.”
The show’s unique location on a college campus also creates a new dynamic, which Wride and Fisher Museum Director Selma Holo recognize. The exhibition specifically interacts with USC by going hand in hand with various programs, including an upcoming poetry reading titled A Sight-Specific Poetry Reading.
“This exhibition has to have its own integrity as well as being part of a bigger web,” Holo said. “Because it’s at a university, it’s important that we have not only the objects on the wall and the text panels. The programs we have that accompany this show are very important for the students.”
Yet someone on campus who stumbles across the show, unaware of PST, can still appreciate the exhibition.
“As a curator, I always believe there are so many multiple access points to work that you put on the wall and one of my jobs is to keep all of those access points as open as possible,” Wride said. “For the USC students and faculty audience, it was my intent to provide a glance into issues of the ’70s that are still affecting art-making today.”
The amount of materials in the show might overwhelm a casual visitor at first, but the issues presented remain significant.
“There are issues of race, social class, marginalized groups and just what is art, that are raised and, to some extent, answered in the exhibition,” Holo said.
Wride explained that until the late 1930s and the explosion of intellectual conversation and collectors, photography wasn’t truly accepted as an art form.
“As soon as photography generally was more accepted, LACPS laid all the groundwork in Los Angeles,” Wride said. “It had created an infrastructure for photography, it created community, it broached philosophical and intellectual issues that made photography as art relevant.”
Even if a visitor doesn’t recognize any of the names associated with the photographs, the works exist as humorous, thought-provoking and technically adventurous documents of a bygone era.
The large spectrum of aesthetic style proves initially daunting, but ultimately impressive. Bonnie Gordon’s pieces present intriguing mixtures between words and images, as are Barbara DeGenevieve’s humorous works. Additionally, photographs like Todd Gray’s explore the presentation of landscapes, while Marion Palfi’s heart-wrenching images touch on the issue of poverty.
In the end, the exhibition provides a rare historical look at an important organization and plenty of inspiration for any new and emerging artists. The floor of the Fisher Museum reflects the blurred images of all the pieces hanging on the wall, possibly waiting to be walked on by the next great artists to make a splash in the world of photography.
Sight Specific: LACPS and the Politics of Community runs through April 7.

USC students are no strangers to traffic. We live in the middle of Los Angeles, within short distance of two major freeways; traffic is almost inescapable. On a Friday afternoon, the freeways look like two blankets of lights: one red and one white, slowly moving in opposite directions.
For this reason, delays because of construction are usually unwelcome. Obviously, these repairs are necessary to keep the roads safe. Most of the time, the construction on freeways is done late at night when few cars are on the road.
Negligent management, however, can cause projects to go off-schedule — and the results are often ugly.
Last week, a traffic jam showed how ugly it could get. A combination of miscommunication, disorganization and bad luck led to a 25-mile traffic jam on the 10 Freeway. Drivers had to leave their cars on the freeway to look for gas.
What caused this chaos? Irresponsibility on the part of Caltrans, the state department of transportation. The public information office was not notified about the construction; more road was pulled off than could have been replaced in time; the concrete plant responsible for the replacement went disastrously idle because of a computer error; Caltrans was not made aware in time.
The maelstrom of events that led to this complete stagnation was unlucky. Still, Caltrans should have been able to prevent something of this magnitude from happening. What would have happened if there was an ambulance attempting to use that freeway for an emergency? Lives could have easily been lost.
Caltrans needs to instill stricter policies when undergoing these construction efforts.
The department can develop a checklist dictating that before work starts, the public information office must be notified, and that before roads are being torn up, the state of the replacement concrete must be checked first.
After all, imagine if something like this happened on the 110 Freeway.

Last week, I ventured into South Central for the first time in my two years at USC. Prompted by glowing Yelp reviews and a hefty amount of dry-cleaning, I drove to Bowers and Sons Cleaners, located on South Central Avenue.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
After overhearing snippets of a conversation between another patron and the owner of the store — “marching” and “helping out wherever we’re needed” — I asked the owner, Vivian Bowers, what they were talking about.
It turned out that Bowers, the president of the new Central Avenue Business Association, has been at the heart of a years-long struggle to reinvent a community long defined by drugs, crime, gangs, violence and poverty.
And she has been successful. Bowers and Sons has a new awning and a repainted exterior, paid for in part by city redevelopment funds as a result of the business association’s committed lobbying. A Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market opened on the corner of South Central Avenue and East Adams Boulevard in 2010. Thousands of affordable-income housing units have been built throughout the area. The neighborhood is becoming cleaner and more business-friendly.
Change is happening in District 9, Bowers’ home. The district includes USC, part of Downtown and the communities of South L.A. and Little Tokyo.
Yet every 10 years, the Los Angeles City Council redraws district lines to account for population changes. The purpose: Equal populations supposedly translate into equal access to local political representation.
Unfortunately for District 9, redistricting would reverse much of the positive progress the community has made.
The city plans to redraw District 9 to include three of the poorest low-income housing complexes in the area. This would make it the poorest L.A. district in the history of the city, according to Southern California Public Radio.
Redrawing translates into less funding.
“The new Ninth [District] would consist largely of densely populated low-income housing and small mom-and-pop business translating to a small tax base,” Bowers said in an email. “At the end of the day, the councilperson Downtown would be hard-pressed to share their tax dollars or encourage private developers or non-profits to invest or collaborate with/in a neighboring district.”
By contrast, a councilperson representing a more affluent district is able to leverage tax dollars and private funding for much-needed projects, housing and services — things District 9 and the area surrounding USC desperately need.
Bowers and Sons is one of the many largely ignored reminders of the deep divides between USC and the surrounding community.
Students often complain about the general absence of amenities in the surrounding area: lack of healthy food options, nice restaurants, cafes, grocery stores and retail outlets. Though Central Avenue isn’t right here, it’s less than 10 minutes away from where many USC students live.
If District 9 continues moving forward with the kind of work that Bowers has propelled — even returning to its glory days in the 1940s, when the area boasted great sit-down restaurants, theaters, law firms and rich nightlife — USC students would have easy access to all these services.
But if the district is redrawn, progress will halt. The improvements are made possible with tax money, which has generated decades-long missing investor interest. Without tax dollars or investors, District 9 would have to switch gears and seek out other funding sources; this process would slow down development.
Bowers and the residents of South Central are not the only ones who would lose out if we continue to ignore the pressing issues of the area that many of us call home for four years.
There are many differences between USC and the surrounding area, but that does not mean we are separate from the issues that shape this community.
It’s time that students think about the community as a whole and of USC as a part of that whole.
Just as Bowers and her community are fighting to invest in and improve their futures, we should as well.

Redistrictiing is a concern for all of us and for the future of our community. This article helps point out the relevenace of the 9th District for those who think the 9th District is irrelevant. Thank you Ms. Kadvany for the call to attention.

This past Sunday, columnist Nitsuh Abebe published a piece for Pitchfork entitled “Embarrassment Rock,” about ‘rockism.’
He described the term as “a variety of close-mindedness.” To be a rockist is to reject all music which does not conform to a certain rock n’ roll aesthetic. Rockists hate hip-hop, pop and rap; they despise challenging and innovative music. They haunt YouTube videos of the Black Eyed Peas, for example, so that they can complain about how bad the Black Eyed Peas are.
Side-effects of rockism include eye-rolling and friendlessness. If your smirk lasts more than four hours, call your doctor.
Hey Pitchfork, now that we’re on the subject of close-mindedness—I have been meaning to talk to you about your reviews. I happen to like many of them. But at the same time you have to admit that your reviews cater to a specific set of preferences, i.e., each individual reviewer’s personal preferences, and that hoisting these preferences above everybody else’s (via a hokey hundred-point scoring system) as an objective good-music-o-meter is, like rockism, just glorifying an aesthetic.
For example: in her 5.5 review of Lana Del Rey’s recent Born to Die, reviewer Lindsay Zoladz complained centrally that some of the lyrics “feel limp and pointless.” But every person feels differently; really the lyrics feel limp and pointless to Lindsay Zoladz.
In a more recent review of Islands’ A Sleep & a Forgetting, Larry Fitzmaurice celebrated the album as “emotionally devastating” and “unassumingly, unabashedly pretty.” Really, Larry Fitzmaurice’s emotions were devastated, and Larry Fitzmaurice thought the music was pretty. Does that mean, as Larry Fitzmaurice claims, that this album deserves precisely 7.9 out of 10 on the scale of absolute quality?
Maybe it’s not fair to bully you, Pitchfork. Countless other publications (including this one!) assign numerical scores to the unquantifiable. Music is not a math problem. If you listen to a piece of music with a scoring mentality you are letting fractions distract you—you are distancing yourself from the artist; you are reviewing, not revering.
Abebe’s column about rockists is arguing, essentially, Stop thinking that only your music is good—look at how good this other music can be, too. But we ought to stop worrying altogether about ‘good,’ and listen.
