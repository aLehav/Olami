USC will gain a sixth school of the arts with the addition of the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, President C. L. Max Nikias announced Friday in an open letter to the USC community.
The school and the Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center at USC will be founded with the aid of an endowment Kaufman created with what Nikias called a “generous gift” to the university. Nikias also said the Kaufman School of Dance is the first school established through an endowment in 40 years at USC.
Though Nikias did not name the amount of Kaufman’s donation, he called her gift “one of the largest in the history of American dance.”
The school will offer training in classical ballet, as well as modern, jazz and world dance, and its students will receive a bachelor of fine arts. Thornton School of Music Dean Robert Cutietta will head the school.
Kaufman’s endowment will also fund the schools programs and activities, as well as student scholarships and recruitment.
Kaufman’s reputation will also likely help the school recruit its first students, who will begin classes in the fall of 2015. A renowned arts philanthropist, Kaufman has previously donated money to the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and The Juilliard School.
“Her esteemed name will certainly enhance the school’s reputation, while ensuring that the university is able to transform the lives of generations of students, as well as the future of dance in Los Angeles and around the world,” Nikias said in the letter.
Part of Kaufman’s gift will also fund dance outreach programs for high school students in the USC Family of Schools.

Poor teaching plagues bright futures. Evaluating the performance of teachers has become essential to improving school systems across the nation; however, student scores on standardized tests should never be taken as the measure of an educator’s worth.
With the rise of new test score-based models such as Los Angeles Unified School District’s “Academic Growth Over Time,” stellar teachers are driven out of their profession solely because of insufficient data gathering.
Last week, the Los Angeles Times ran a story on Kyle Hunsberger, a teacher at Johnnie Cochran Jr. Middle School. While students proclaim Hunsberger “the best math teacher they’ve ever had,” the district’s test score model deemed him average.
Teachers have brought attention to other flaws in the test score system, such as that they are rated on the subjects they are less familiar with and that inconsistent class sizes—particularly at large, underfunded schools—may skew the data being gathered.
Such complaints also demonstrate that teachers have identified a correlation between their performance on test-based evaluations and where and how they choose to teach. This create a disincentive for teaching in low-income areas, where students tend to perform more poorly on standardized tests, and also encourages educators to “teach to the test” rather than emphasizing critical thinking and long-term learning.  
If test scores continue to be looked at as a measure of an educator’s worth, the improvement critical to our school system will never come. Teachers—and students—have so much more to their names than just numbers. Unfortunately, the emotional growth, maturity and attitudinal changes that bloom behind the statistics are largely overlooked.
In addition to test scores, evaluations should include assessments by classroom experts who observe students actually learning. The evaluation thus becomes not a grade, but feedback on which teachers can base their improvement.
School districts can also reach out to independent educational programs, such as USC’s own Joint Educational Project, to dig deeper into the problems surrounding poor teaching nationwide.
Teaching evaluations could do so much more than the current imperfect models. We just have to start seeing the bigger picture.

The USC men’s basketball team received a big boost right before the season opener against Coppin State, when 7-foot-two-inch transfer center Omar Oraby was granted a hardship waiver by the NCAA.
Hardship waivers are requested when a player wishes to override the standard one-year waiting period for transfers due to mitigating personal circumstances. USC applied on Oraby’s behalf in September when he declared his intent to attend the school.
Had the waiver been denied, Oraby would have been required to sit out this season and begin playing in 2013 with two years of eligibility remaining.
Oraby transferred from Rice University in the fall and averaged 6 points, 3.6 rebounds and 1.6 blocks in under 12 minutes per game when he played for the Owls. He has been practicing with the Trojans for the past month while waiting for the NCAA’s ruling.
He is the third 7-foot player on the roster this year and measures up with junior forward Dewayne Dedmon and senior center James Blasczyk.
The Trojans play against Coppin State at the Galen Center at 8 p.m. Friday.
