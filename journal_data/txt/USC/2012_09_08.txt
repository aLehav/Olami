Perhaps a weather delay was just what No. 2 USC needed in order to get its somewhat stagnant offense going.
After Saturday’s 69-minute weather delay, the Trojans exploded for 28 points in the second half. Behind a career-best six touchdown passes, senior quarterback Matt Barkley led the Trojans to a 42-29 win over Syracuse at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.

In front of an announced crowd of 39,507, the Trojans (2-0) only amassed 71 yards in the first quarter, with Barkley having just 27 passing yards. USC attempted three fourth-down conversions in the first, converting one on a Marqise Lee sweep. Kiffin did not make excuses after the game and gave all the credit to the Orange.
“A lot of praise for those guys,” Kiffin said. “This is a good team that we were coming to play today. … Give those guys a lot of credit for playing really hard.”
Kiffin also made reference to the fact that playing in an NFL stadium on the other side of the country made things difficult.
“It’s not an easy situation to come into,” Kiffin said in reference to playing at the home of the New York Giants and Jets. “That’s why NFL teams come look at their schedules at the beginning of the year and don’t want to count their East Coast trips.”
After a slow first quarter, USC’s luck turned in the second quarter when Barkley hit sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee for a 13-yard touchdown. Barkley also found junior wide receiver Robert Woods down the sideline with a little more than a minute to go in the half. Barkley finished with 187 yards passing on 23 completions.
“[Barkley] played really well,” Kiffin said. “Once again, weird environment today, weather issues, wind issues, and I thought he took care of the ball really well.”
The Orange put their first points on the board as time expired in the half, and USC was leading 14-3 — but then the clouds came.
Fans were forced to stand inside the stadium while the players and coaches left the field for more than an hour as intense rain and storms passed overhead. During the delay, Barkley said the team was calm and relaxed.
“I put my feet up, put my headphones on,” Barkley said. “I took my pads off. I knew it was going to be longer than five or 10 minutes.” 
After the delay, Barkley hit Woods for a four-yard touchdown with 11:38 left in the third. Syracuse, with quarterback Ryan Nassib at the helm, led the Orange to within five points after Barkley threw his first interception of the season.
Entering the fourth, with the game close at 21-16, Barkley threw a touchdown to sophomore tight end Xavier Grimble, who bounced off four would-be tacklers to get into the endzone.
Through two games, the Heisman hopeful has thrown 10 touchdowns and only one interception. Barkley’s six scoring tosses Saturday matched USC’s in-game record and put him at a career total of 90 — nine shy of Matt Leinart’s school record.
Despite Barkley’s touchdowns, it was a Robert Woods run in the fourth quarter that got everyone in the stands on their feet.
Woods took a reverse up the left sideline and cut all the way across to the right before being tackled by a Syracuse player after a 76-yard gain.
“Coach Kiffin called a reverse, [we had] been practicing it the whole week,” Woods said. “[I] hit the edge — great block from Marqise [Lee] — two cuts, and I just tried to race down the sideline.”
He finished with 76 rushing yards, 93 yards receiving and a pair of touchdowns. Lee had 66 yards receiving and three touchdowns.
Barkley capped off his night with a scoring toss to Lee with 5:45 left in the game to put the game at 42-22. The Orange would score late to make the final tally 42-29.
The defense held up its end of the bargain Saturday night, forcing Nassib, the nation’s leading passer, to throw two interceptions, both of which were caught by sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey. Bailey took charge of the defense when the game got close and finished the game with eight tackles.
“I am one of the leaders of our defense,” Bailey said. “We huddled up and got the message across that we had to come up with a stop and put the ball back into our offense’s hands. We have one of the most explosive offenses in the country, and they exploded in the second half like we thought.”
The Trojans head back to the West Coast for next week’s game and will face Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif. on Sept. 15, marking their first Pac-12 contest of the season.

As the MTV Video Music Awards started Thursday night at the Staples Center, the expected parade of beautifully groomed celebrities, the gleam of bright lights and the buzz surrounding the ceremony’s anticipated winners were all present.
The annual event, which focuses on honoring artists who have crafted the most creative and acclaimed videos during the past year, had all of its usual glamorous elements. Despite being a first year, musically inept college student, I attended the event.
Each year, millions of young adults watch the stars congregate and celebrate together from home. According to MTV, their 2011 showing had an audience of 12.4 million viewers. This year, MTV’s Twitter Tracker showed that 12.8 million tweets were made about the VMAs.
Fans tune in to watch the stars glide down the red carpet dressed in the most elegant, expensive and often questionable attire. Their dazzling performances and impromptu speeches leave people talking for days, weeks and even years afterwards — just ask Kanye West. Seconds before the category winners are announced viewers sit on the edge of their seats, guessing who will be the recipient of each award. Cameras pan through the crowd offering glimpses of all the popular musicians.
Yet, the world of Hollywood stars and their award ceremonies, are very removed from the daily lives of the fans whose support they profit from. Though USC is located two miles from the Staples Center, the distance between the everyday realities of celebrities and college students are very removed from one another.
When I first walked into the Staples Center, I relished at the thought of being in the same arena as Pink, Chris Brown and Alicia Keys. The appearance of the Olympic gymnasts and, in particular, Gabby Douglas during Alicia Keys and Nicki Minaj’s performance of “Girl on Fire,” was stunning. The culmination of cultural idols brought me to my feet.
Still there was a void. I wanted to be closer and able to communicate with the artists.
Because MTV did not want to compete with President Obama’s speech at the Democratic National Convention, which aired live that same night, they ended the event early with a performance by Taylor Swift singing her catchy song “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” The abrupt end further showed the musicians’ inability to fully please their fans up close, in person.
Despite living in Los Angeles, being members of a generation dominated by innovative technology and cinematography and heavily contributing to the music and fashion culture, the relevance of the event is lost on campus. Artists have a significant role in students’ lives, but young adults do not have influence on theirs. The apathy USC students feel from the glamour at LA Live comes from this dichotomy.
The concept of the Video Music Awards ceremony, once dubbed the “Oscars for youth,” was rooted in the idea that winners represented the culture and opinions and interests of young adults. Today, the structure of the VMAs has ousted the initial intention and made it very insignificant to even the students that are closest to it.
Students listen to music in order to connect with the experience that the artist is singing about. Stars who are nominated for VMAs are the most skilled at creating this relationship with their audience.
Singer Frank Ocean had a noteworthy performance at the VMAs because he tapped into the universal feeling of heartache, missed opportunity and loneliness when he sang his hit single “Thinkin’ About You” to the audience.
The VMAs were highly successful last year because of the many opportunities viewers had to feel involved. When Beyonce presented her pregnancy to the world, people were let into her personal life and rejoiced with her and Jay-Z.
Similarly, Adele’s return to performing after her ordeal with medical problems, allowed everyone who tuned into the VMAs to share in her triumph. Those moments are most treasured because they offer viewers’ opportunities to explore the stars’ world.
Though viewers obsess about celebrities, when they are not given this chance to have a participatory role in the event, especially when they are physically close to them like USC students are to LA Live, it turns into a lackluster experience.
Young adults watch the VMAs year and year again to see the progression of their musical tastes. They hope to find relatable moments with the celebrities they adore. They wish to get a better view of their favorite artists’ personalities.
In the coming years, maybe viewers will be able to tune in and draw even more parallels between their own lifestyles and those presented in the award ceremony. But for now, we will all just be watching from afar.
This vma review could have been summed in one sentence. This year’s show was boring.
