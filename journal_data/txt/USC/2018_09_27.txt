No. 1 USC will compete in Riverside, Calif. at the Lancer Invitational on Friday and Saturday before returning home to face UC Santa Barbara on Sunday at 1 p.m. The team looks to keep its undefeated streak through five matches this weekend and improve its 12-0 record.
On Friday, the Trojans will kick off the Lancer Joust at noon against California Baptist followed immediately by a match against La Verne at 1:30 p.m., who USC already beat earlier in the season, 20-5. USC has not played the Lancers this season but hold an overall 13-0 record against Cal Baptist after a 16-6 win in 2017. The Lancers currently hold a 7-7 overall after falling to UC Davis 12-10 and beating Redlands 14-10 last week. 
Although the Trojans have had an outstanding season so far, sophomore driver Sawyer Rhodes said they make every game count regardless of past outcomes.
“[We] just keep pushing, don’t get soft or think you’re better than anyone else,” Rhodes said. “[We] just take every game one at a time, [and] don’t really focus on the fact that you already beat them or the fact that you’re tired. Just play every game to win it and do your best.”
On Saturday, the Trojans will face Concordia and Redlands. USC has played against both teams, beating Concordia twice (23-5 and 32-7) and Redlands 23-2. The home opener this season was against Concordia, improving USC’s all-time overall against the Eagles to 9-0.   
Concordia enters the week at 3-8 overall after a 14-4 loss to UC Davis last week. Redlands is currently at 3-9 overall after a 6-4 loss to Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and a 14-10 loss to Cal Baptist last week. USC improved 10-0 all-time against Redlands after a victorious match at the Inland Empire Classic earlier this season.   
On Sunday, the Trojans return to home waters to compete against No. 5 Santa Barbara at 1 p.m. The Gauchos fell to the Trojans earlier this season, 10-3. UCSB enters the week 12-4 overall after beating Pepperdine 16-4 and losing in a close match against Stanford 9-7. Gauchos senior driver Boris Jovanovic leads in scoring with 50 goals in his collegiate career so far. USC holds an all-time record of 73-12-2 against UCSB with wins in the past 55 matches, including a 10-3 win earlier this season at the Aggie RoundUp.  
With five games coming up this weekend, the Trojans are working hard in preparation. All of these matches will culminate in their big match against rival Stanford the following weekend up north.   
“I think it is a big test to see how well we can play, especially on Sunday coming back and playing Santa Barbara here,” Rhodes said. “They’re a pretty tough team so being able to get through the week and finish on a good note will … raise our spirits… [If we win] we’ll have probably a mellower week while we prepare for Stanford.”

Heading into another full weekend of games, the women’s volleyball team looks to keep its five-game win streak alive as it travels up north to face No. 2 Stanford on Friday  and Cal on Sunday. Coming off a hard-fought, five-set victory Sunday against Colorado, the team is striving to improve consistency on the court and to capitalize on standardizing their strong moments.
“I thought we prepared well for Colorado and I thought we started well against [them], but it was an up and down match for sure,” head coach Brent Crouch said. “The big takeaway was just I was proud that they were able to flip it back on when they needed to. That was a tough place to play.”
USC has already faced and defeated five of seven ranked opponents this year, but Stanford comes with a strong history. In the team’s last meeting, the Cardinal finished the game in a quick three sets, but the Trojans are looking for redemption. 
“I think [our] team has developed a little,” senior libero Victoria Garrick said. “I wouldn’t call it a rivalry, but we definitely all know we are coming to play because we know that regardless of ranking, each team has a chance. We really want to go into Maples this year and feel good about what we’re doing and put up a good fight.”
The Trojans have been preparing for this weekend by watching footage, focusing on both their mistakes and plays that came together to earn points. Their focus is less about their record and more about if they as a team are improving. By the end of season, they want to be able to say they have come a long way. So far, they already feel that sense of improvement, but are not satisfied yet and Crouch is always encouraging them to push themselves.
Stanford’s junior setter Jenna Gray is averaging 12.21 assists per game compared to USC freshman setter Raquel Lázaro’s 11.14. Cal presents its own challenges in sophomore outside hitter Mima Mirkovic, who averages 3.12 kills and 3.63 digs per game. However, Garrick, who is averaging 4.70 digs a game, is prepared to defend.
“We’re not in control of the score, but we are in control of how we can play and what we do,” Crouch said. “There have been times when I have really gotten on them in timeouts when we’ve been ahead by a lot because I think the level is not as good as we need to be. It gets easy to get caught up in the wins and losses and it’s hard to stay focused on if we’re getting better, [and if we are] doing the right things.”
Though they know that Stanford is the game they need to focus on because of their ranking. But, the Women of Troy are not counting out the Golden Bears.
“I think the Cal match will be a really big test for us,” Crouch said. “How do we come out after being on the road for that long after what it’s going to be like at Stanford? Can we maintain that same level of intensity against Cal that we do against Stanford?”
The Women of Troy have set goals for both matches, and they will look to extend their win streak to seven games by the end of the weekend. 
“We don’t want to take any opponent lightly, but we know that Stanford is the bigger matchup of this week,” Garrick said. “I feel like when it comes to Cal, we’ll just focus on being efficient early and coming out and being on top of things. No matter what, I think we’re going to be coming back to the gym on Monday with things to work on and that’s exciting and challenging.”

Former USC basketball assistant coach Tony Bland was arrested last year on a bribery charge. (Daily Trojan file photo)
A year ago from yesterday, I woke up way too early to a text from one of my best friends in the sports reporting business. She told me to get up and get out of bed because I had work to do — USC assistant basketball coach Tony Bland had been arrested by the FBI.
I look back on that day fairly fondly (unlike managing editor Eric He, who answered my text about this anniversary with an automatic “ugh”) because despite the stress, it was a highly memorable day of breaking news and writing on deadline. However, as we approach this one-year anniversary mark, it’s strange for me to look back at the last year and see how little has changed.
Last year’s FBI investigation rocked the world of basketball, and it particularly rocked mine. I grew up cheering for the Kansas Jayhawks, and later started backing the Louisville Cardinals, the school of choice for my dad’s side of the family, most of whom live in Louisville. Then I came to USC for college and became a (somewhat lukewarm) fan of Trojan basketball. And somehow last year, all of my teams were embroiled in one of the biggest college sports scandals of all time.
Since the news broke and the FBI made its initial arrests, a lot has changed around the NCAA. Louisville cut off legendary head coach Rick Pitino, and USC let go of Bland. Other schools, like Kansas and Arizona, were comparatively unphased. But still, the atmosphere of college basketball seemed to shift in an inescapable, irreparable way. The gig was up, and now everyone — fans, boosters, coaches, players — knew the truth about how recruiting plays out in the NCAA.
A year later, the NCAA has yet to make any real changes. Sure, there was an action plan and a few committees put together, but the process of NCAA recruiting on the whole looks the same. As the FBI investigation trudges on and individual coaches await their fates, I can’t help but wonder — could this happen again?
It’s my personal belief that all college athletes should be allowed to make money off themselves. Plain and simple. The concept of the purity of “amateurism” is sweet and also naive, and it allows for young athletes to be used and abused by their college programs with little reward outside of a few years of fame and a communication degree.
College athletes should earn revenue cuts equivalent to what a professional player would make from the earnings of their team. The price of tuition and housing might be subtracted from those revenue cuts — say, an Alabama football player is making $750,000 a year for a team, but Alabama wants to subtract the $70,000 tuition and board.Nonetheless, athletes who drive revenue for athletic institutions deserve a fair cut of the profits.
With that being said, I have equal expectations of the college recruiting process. Because when it comes down to it, I don’t see the ethical quandary. If a coach wants to buy a kid dinner on a recruiting visit, who does that hurt? And who does it hurt when the stakes are higher (an Xbox, a car, a $10,000 check)?
College athletes give everything to their programs, often sacrificing social lives and GPAs to help their team reach the next level. Sure, there are the few who can make it all work — Bryce Love and his stem cell research, Laurent Duvernay-Tardiff and his doctorate — but these are exceptions, not the norm.
I remember interviewing Sam Darnold last year, and he described laying around his house with his teammates after a long day of classes, meetings and practices, “trying not to move too much” because they were so tired. Most college athletes can’t join clubs or student publications, intern in the summers or gain work experience.
A year ago, the lives of many in the NCAA basketball community changed forever. Bland might go to jail, along with other coaches and lawyers involved in the mess of the FBI investigation. And despite the drastic impact of the investigation, the nature of the NCAA hasn’t been impacted that much at all.
The NCAA must change. If last year taught us anything, it is that the status quo is not sustainable. Not only are the rules being broken consistently and consciously, but they’ve also become unjust rules in their own right. Making this change and righting this wrong won’t be easy for the NCAA, but the first steps must be taken now — and should have begun a year ago — before another mess like this is made.

Senior linebacker Porter Gustin leads the Trojan defense with 4.5 sacks so far this season. (Sarah Kim | Daily Trojan)
Throughout the opening four games of this season, the weakest link for the Trojan football program has been the defensive secondary. With sights set on Arizona — and the team’s explosive quarterback, Khalil Tate — head coach Clay Helton emphasized mental toughness as the Trojans hit the field for practice on Wednesday.
Helton acknowledged that Tate has a versatility of strengths, including the ability to drop balls deep, forcing defenses to spread thinly across the field to adapt to the quarterback’s wily triple threat on the ground, in both the short passing game and deep in the field. 
“[We need to keep] contain on probably the most dangerous quarterback that we’ll face all season,” Helton said. “You see some of the dimes he’s dropping in on deep balls once the play is broken down … [and it] is unique. We’ve got to be able to keep him in the pocket and keep him contained.”
The Wildcats are averaging over 270 passing yards per game, and Tate posted close to 350 passing yards against Houston and Southern Utah. Although he has been held to less than 20 yards rushing per game, Tate is known to rip off big gains on his feet when given a big enough hole to blast through.
“You put [redshirt sophomore running back] J.J. Taylor with 260 yards of passing, and that’s a dangerous offense,” Helton said.
Tate has yet to notch a victory over the Trojans, however, suffering a loss on his home field and in the Coliseum. As he prepares to host USC for his team’s first home field game against a Pac-12 opponent on Saturday, the junior quarterback will be anxious to even that record.
“A dual-threat quarterback is always tough,” senior linebacker Porter Gustin said. “But we know what he can do and we know what he’s capable of. We’ve got to prepare for that. It’s like they’re playing with an extra man out there.”
This will be a major test for the Trojans, whose main struggle so far this season has been to create a solid passing defense. The team allowed Washington State quarterback Gardner Minshew II to throw for 344 yards and three touchdowns last week, failing to pick up an interception and allowing the quarterback to throw 71 percent.
“When you play man coverage, you don’t see a ton of picks. You see a lot more in zone coverage,” Helton said. “We do have a lot of past break ups, hopefully we’ll get our hands on the ball a little more. It also comes with tipped balls. … Hopefully we’ll get some more of those too.”
The secondary in particular struggled with deep passes, allowing Cougars receiver Easop Winston Jr. to average almost 24 yards per carry and grab a 59-yard touchdown lob. Against Tate, the unit will be forced to tighten up or pay up.
The Trojans also struggled to challenge the passer and collapse the pocket, with Gustin recording the lone sack in the game against Washington State. Without heavy pressure in the face of the quarterback, Tate will be free to pick off receivers left and right, leaving the secondary wide open.
One key change could be the introduction of true freshman corner Olaijah Griffin to the starting lineup. Griffin has slowly made his way into a regular rotation for the Trojans, standing out in last week’s game against Washington State. 
During Wednesday’s practice, the freshman earned first-team reps. He finished practice with a pick-six, earning howls of approval from his teammates on both sides of the ball. Griffin could provide a much-needed spark to the Trojan secondary.
Injury report
Redshirt freshman defensive lineman Jay Tufele, who blocked the game-winning field goal attempt in Saturday’s game against Washington State, returned to action. Gustin and sophomore offensive tackle Andrew Vorhees both participated in practice, but on a limited basis. Gustin is still nursing a knee injury, and Vorhees is recovering from a sternum contusion. Both are expected to make full returns by game time on Saturday.
Freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown remains limited with an AC shoulder sprain. Redshirt freshman outside tackle Jalen McKenzie also sat out practice with a strained back.

Joscelyn Stocks | Daily Trojan
My decision to attend USC was a daylong ordeal — I left my house bright and early on the first day of May only to skip school and hunker down at the nearest Starbucks for 13 consecutive hours.
I sat there for a long time, scrolling through College Confidential and binge-watching decision day YouTube videos, that the staff started asking me to move my feet as they swept the floor — covertly suggesting that I leave. By the end of the night, I clicked on the “submit” button, sealing my fate as a Trojan, and left Starbucks 10 minutes before closing, weighed with the slight guilt of sapping up its Wi-Fi all day but only ordering two drinks.
Starbucks has become an extremely lucrative business, almost monopolizing the coffee chain industry, because of its sheer ability to accommodate with a space. Starbucks relies on creating a clean, welcoming, ambient space for customers to enjoy their drinks. Part of the company’s product is the experience of drinking coffee in the physical environment, and as a result, employees have to consider the lowest common denominators among their customers. 
This can lead to generalizations and assumptions, but it also requires a high level of observation and awareness of everyone in the room. A single location’s team is responsible for ensuring that people enjoy their time but do not overstay their welcome or encroach on anyone else’s experience. 
This means that Starbucks constructs social cues so that customers want to return to the inviting space, but feel guilty, as I did, for overusing it or not purchasing anything. Overt interior design choices, like the paucity of outlets in smaller locations or the convenient location of an exit at the end of the coffee bar are a few factors, but staff behavior is often the most important.
Starbucks made headlines throughout the year with a slew of announcements: the replacement of plastic straws with a more environmentally friendly lid design; the departure of former CEO and executive chairman Howard Schultz; and the single-day shut down of more than 8,000 U.S. locations. 
This shutdown was to conduct implicit bias training of about 175,000 employees, following an incident at a Philadelphia Starbucks, in which a manager called the police to arrest two black men after they asked to use the restroom without ordering any drinks. Outrage at the manager and her team ensued, as well as a training day to “address implicit bias, promote conscious inclusion, prevent discrimination and ensure everyone inside a Starbucks store feels safe and welcome.”
Many dismissed this day of training as a publicity stunt — how could a single day of training reverse deep-rooted prejudices? Starbucks’ 2015 campaign “Race Together,” fell slightly short of an entertaining failure, and its training processes only became transparent to the public following the incident in May. 
Implementing diversity and inclusion training during standard barista staff training, rather than making the biggest splash possible on a single, seemingly arbitrary day, could have a longer lasting effect on the company as a whole.
But in a way, it was a necessary publicity stunt. Starbucks’ business model relies on the regulation of interactions with customers and creating the cafe experience. If Starbucks had not addressed that serious incident of racism in a widespread way, the core component of the product it serves would be at risk. 
Starbucks lost millions of dollars that day, which represents neither a simple cleanup of their corporate standing nor a mad dash to bring up their numbers — it was a public admission that what they serve is more than coffee.
 While the effectiveness of implicit bias training is still unclear, the public acknowledgement of fault sends a clear message to customers — and more importantly to employees — that the need for an inclusive, welcoming and thoughtful experience is far more important than coffee.

Thomas Forman | Daily Trojan Dramatic documenting · The School of Cinematic Arts held a screening of the documentary “Bisbee ‘17” and held a post-Q&A discussion with Robert Greene, the director of the film. (Thomas Forman | Daily Trojan)
More than a century  ago, the mining community of  Bisbee became the site of the Bisbee Deportation, a mass kidnapping of mine workers that one local compared to an “ethnic cleansing.” This American tragedy has shaped the focus of Robert Greene’s documentary, “Bisbee ’17,” which was shot to commemorate the event’s centennial last year and was screened  Tuesday night at USC’s Albert and Dana Broccoli Theatre. 
“The broader context really is that Bisbee was known as a white man’s camp at the time,” Greene said in an interview with NPR. “But they brought in a lot of immigrant labor, so it was many Mexicans, many Eastern Europeans.”
The film follows the people of present-day Bisbee as they stage a reenactment of the terrible events that plagued their town. Although Greene and his team were the direct instigators of this reenactment by providing the equipment, finances and film experience, Greene said that the idea been brought up “several years prior” by a local committee.
“There was a committee that started to find ways to commemorate,” he told NPR. “And part of our original goal … is documenting some of those processes.”
“Bisbee ’17” highlights a town desperately trying to move on from its past. Its residents, instead of covering up the events that transpired, try to forgive their ancestors and commit to never repeat their past mistakes.  
Greene’s work has a pensive tone which persists throughout, but does not dominate the film. As director, Greene’s choice of emphasis is less on the factual details of the historical event, but more on its remembrance and reflection by the town’s residents.  Throughout the 112 minutes of runtime, the majority of the film is dedicated to depicting the cast members in their ordinary attire and occupations, having them introduce themselves, their views of the Bisbee Deportation and what they hope to achieve through participating in the reenactment. 
In a town where history has been so reliant on mining corporations, Greene said that Bisbee would “literally just be mountains,” if not for the entrance of the Phelps Dodge Company to the area in the 1880s. The attitudes of the townspeople vary — from pro-Union activists and pro-Company apologists to indifference. 
As lifelong residents of the mining town, many cast members are direct descendants of the men arrested in the deportations of 1917. Bringing family stories from either side of the conflict, the characters attempt to justify the actions of their forebears. 
At the time of the deportation, the town was divided.  And in 2017, difference in opinion still exists, but is much more accepted. As the town’s  younger generations take on the task of hyper-realistically carrying out the actions they themselves “could not imagine” doing to each other, conflict persists. A family’s matriarchal figure said she is able to be encouraging of the reenactment, while maintaining that she is “proud” of her grandfather for acting on what he believed was right.
There’s something wonderful in the characters’ proclivity to agree to disagree. There is a scene where the actors, who were previously enacting deportations on a train while yelling profanities and threats at each other, immediately start to laugh and pat each other on the back as soon as Greene yells, “Cut!” 
“The goal’s not to say, ‘Hey, we’ve got to be objective,’” Greene said. “There’s human opinion on both sides, and that’s worth knowing. I think it’s just human.” 
“Bisbee ’17” was produced by 4th Row Films and will be released in Los Angeles on Friday.

The artwork in “About You” captures the banality of life with poignance and grace. The exhibit was open from Sept. 13-27. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
A winding pathway constructed from black fabric, paint and photographs is the opening scene of Austin Dalgleish and Bardia Soltani’s new photography exhibit, “About You.” The exhibit, which opened on Sept. 20 at the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery, is filled with art that takes viewers from scenes of mundane board game pieces to vast horizon landscapes.
Dalgleish, an alumnus, and Soltani, a current student, attempt to seize on “the frivolity and richness of the everyday” and “explore the source of consciousness” in this joint project, according to the event description. An image of two people sitting on a plane, one of the first photographs at the start of “About You,” is emblematic of the theme. It is decidedly unremarkable; there is no unusual framing or  unexpected action.
Dalgleish and Soltani set the mood for the rest of the showcase with this photograph — a truthful representation of life and all its mundanities.
The photographs noticeably shift in scale toward the end of the first pathway. The pictures become larger, grander and less specific. Where the first photographs clearly show people’s faces — with some using faces as focal points —  later images deliberately conceal faces and body parts: A woman in a bathtub turns her head to hide her face, and a group of people expose their chests from behind wooden slats. All hint at the theme that the show really is “about you.” These   aren’t just photos of strangers, but they are pictures of anybody and everybody as they move through life.
Beyond the faceless photos,  the pieces grow in scale. Through twists and turns, the structure of exhibit highlights the focus from architecture to abstract curves and lines before the photos zoom out to focus on broader landscapes, with clouds, rocks, lakes, trees and horizons. 
The exhibit evolves from being peaceful and introspective to questioning the everchanging nature of love. The art is accentuated by soft bird chirps, mechanical humming and miscellaneous nature sounds accentuate the art, forming the soundtrack of everyday life. Throughout, the exhibit’s lights shift from standard yellow bulbs to multicolored lights, and the monotonous black background is accented with swirling swaths of white paint that get thicker and appear more frequently. 
It’s not until the final room that Dalgleish and Soltani finally delve into “the source of consciousness.” There is an opening in a black cloth positioned so that the finale isn’t visible until viewers walk through the makeshift doorway. 
The ceiling gets higher, as white and black swirl together on all four walls, until the white overpowers the black in a ripple-like effect. Faux candles and rocks pave the way directly to a basin with a single candle above a pool of water filled with stones. 
This is where “About You” narrows its focus to only one person. The exhibit applies the broad spectrum of life it has been showing directly to the viewer, as they stare at their own reflections in dim candlelight. 
Throughout, “About You” expressed a strong theme by focusing on the ordinary, often-overlooked details that make life meaningful and universal. 
The exhibition could have been longer and the final piece could have been more subtle, but it is still a quietly powerful portrayal of the mundane. The exhibit comes full circle with one of its first pieces, a blurry image of a tile from the board game “Life,” a metaphor for what the exhibit successfully conveys — the mundanity, blurriness and tediousness of life.

One of the most heated debates in American politics revolves around one sentence in the Constitution: “A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”
In our politically polarized society, the topic of gun control raises reflexive outcries of “no to guns,” and “guns don’t kill people, people kill people.” The loudest advocates on both sides of this argument are currently manifest in the March for Our Lives movement and National Rifle Association sponsors, though controversy surrounding interpretation of the Second Amendment has perplexed the American public for decades. What’s more, the debate is split between the Democratic Party, which typically advocates for gun control, and the Republican Party, which typically defends unlimited firearm access. 
However, stances on gun control do not need to be black and white. In fact, there are many interpretations of the Second Amendment that fall between the complete abolition of firearms and the uninhibited right to gun ownership. Political parties and interest groups make the American people think that there are only two polarized sides to the issue, but we should be exposed to the full spectrum of stances and theoretical perspectives. 
One of the main issues with interpreting the Second Amendment is discerning what exactly “a well-regulated militia” refers to. Collective rights theory, a well-recognized legal interpretation, finds that the phrase refers to the importance of a state’s right to military defense, not the individual’s right to own firearms. This perspective explains that the Second Amendment does not give individuals the right to freely possess and use firearms. Collective rights theory is based on the fact that the language in the Second Amendment deems the bearing of arms “necessary to the security of a free state” rather than to the security of a free public. 
As states do not have their own armies, most people have overlooked this argument, instead interpreting the law to protect individuals’ rights to own firearms. Individual rights theory is the opposite of collective rights theory, stating that “the right of the people to keep and bear arms,” implies that the founding fathers intended for all Americans to be able to own guns. The NRA and anti-gun control advocates base their argument in individual rights theory. 
Only 8 percent of American adults believe that “almost everyone” should be able to legally own guns, whereas 9 percent say that nearly no one should, according to a Pew Research study.  Noticeably, most Americans believe that there is a middle ground to the right to gun ownership. The technological advancement of firearms has strongly influenced the public’s view on how unlimited their rights to bear arms should be, with many believing that modern firearms should be held to a different standard than the guns available at the time the Second Amendment’s was written. Guns were lethal weapons in 1776 but could not do nearly as much damage as today’s high-capacity weapons can. Sixty-eight percent of urban and suburban residents believe that high-capacity magazines should be federally banned, according to Pew Research Center.  
The Second Amendment can be interpreted through many lenses: emphasizing states’ rights, with a focus on the individual or with contemporary innovation and design in mind. Before adopting others’ opinions about our constitutional rights, I hope that we can all read and think deeply about the rhetoric itself, listen to a broad range of theories without judgement and, ultimately, critically think about the rights we have as Americans.

Institutions must deal with the exposure of various scandals, and USC is no exception. It is hard to continue to trust any company and its leaders after multiple broken promises and scandals. Broken promises and scandals have marked the University of Southern California over the past several years. 
To recap: USC was roiled in scandals for roughly a decade. In Fall 2015, a Los Angeles Times article brought former head football coach Steve Sarkisian’s alcohol use to light. Carmen Puliafito stepped down as dean of USC Keck School of Medicine in Spring 2016, while gynecologist George Tyndall left that summer. In Spring 2017, a student stated she had been sexually harassed by Dworak-Peck School of Social Work professor Erick Guerrero. That summer, the Los Angeles Times broke the story about Puliafito, and the dean hired to replace him, Rohit Varma, resigned due to his own past scandal. That fall, the FBI arrested men’s basketball assistant coach Tony Brand, charging him with bribery and conspiracy to commit fraud. Then the Office of the Provost suspended Guerrero for one semester without pay, prompting faculty members to pen a letter about what they considered a light sentence. In January 2018, revelations of changes to the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund administration sparked student protests. A month later, reports surfaced that men’s basketball players had accepted bribes or participated in illegal conduct. That spring, Sebastian Ridley-Thomas was hired as a professor of social work and public policy after stepping down the previous December from his position as an assemblyman. In mid-May, the Tyndall scandal emerged regarding decades of sexual misconduct, after which hundreds of faculty members called for President C.L. Max Nikias’ resignation. The Board of Trustees quickly stated they had “full confidence” in Nikias. Days later, they stated that Nikias was stepping down, though he didn’t officially resign until August. 
The Board of Trustees elected Rick Caruso as Chairman at the end of May. In a letter to the community, Caruso stated a desire to collaborate with students, staff, faculty and alumni. In August, the Times broke a story about Sebastian Ridley-Thomas’ sexual harassment allegations. Ridley-Thomas stated that the University had violated FERPA by releasing private information about his status as a student.  Throughout all of this, promises were made to the Trojan Family — particularly students — which were then broken as scandal after scandal emerged. Many students have lost faith in the University administration, and are apprehensive about what new scandal the Times will release next.
Despite student leaders’ best efforts, we were shut out of participating on the Presidential Search Advisory Committee. Instead, Caruso asked us to take a “measured” leap of faith and to trust in the entity that has failed us multiple times in the past three years. 
When asked what we believe to be in the best interests of students, student leaders always state exactly what we know is in our best interests, based on the constant, daily conversations we have with our peers. At best, our words are ignored. At worst, we are told — by individuals who are not currently students and who have requested our presence precisely to learn what students need — that what we think is in our best interest is actually not.
We. Are. Tired.
I steadfastly think that most — if not all — trustees and administrators believe they act in students’ best interests; therefore I do not write out of animus. The problem is we are ignored when we state what is in our interests. There are exceptions and there have been improvements, but they are an anomaly, not the rule. Instead, assumptions are made about our “best interests” (e.g., banning media from listening sessions due to a supposed participatory chilling effect, despite already having a private online submission option; recently clarified to not apply to student media) when students think otherwise. 
Inclusion should be the rule. Democratic university governance should be the rule. Empowering students and student leaders to collaboratively tackle university challenges should be the rule. Right now, these rules are nonexistent. Caruso asks for trust and respect for PSAC decisions.  He and other administrators highlight that things are better due to the “unprecedented access” to his position as chairman, signifying a departure from the norm. However, better is a comparative, not a superlative; therefore, just because USC is “better than before” does not mean it is the best it can be. Similarly, just because something is the “norm” does not mean it indicates inherent goodness. In order to be the “best,” norms often need to change, and drastically so. Though we hope to collaborate moving forward, student leaders feel it necessary to highlight that trust and respect must be earned. Multiple scandals and hundreds of irrevocably harmed students have all but evaporated trust. For many, exclusion from the search committee was the last straw.
Of course, students cannot actually win this battle. If we continue our advocacy, we risk being painted as spoiled children who are throwing a tantrum for not getting what we want, proving Caruso correct that students cannot handle being on the committee. However, if we find advocates from within the committee, it proves that students need not be on the search committee to have their voices heard. We are stuck in a representative Catch-22.
But “Fight On” we must. Years of scandals have shown that the University is, in many instances, unable to fully protect students from within. It is time to let students work to protect themselves.

The third season of “Lost L.A.,” a collaborative TV series between public broadcaster KCET and USC Libraries, will premiere on Oct. 9. 
The series, which explores Los Angeles’ history through archival materials, will feature other regions and landmarks in California in its third season. 
“With this season, we are exploring the far reaching impact L.A.’s past has had beyond the city’s borders,” said Juan Devis, KCETLink’s chief creative officer. “We discover the profound connections of Los Angeles to neighboring regions like Yosemite and Palm Springs. The ebb and flow of Angelenos visiting these areas has helped to shape their identities, and created powerful links to the lives of its many residents.”
The upcoming season aims to showcase areas beyond city borders, while also examining Los Angeles as an inspiration for multiple cultural achievements such as art and poetry. 
“This new season … is very much about Los Angeles as a source of imagination and inspiration for California and beyond,” said Catherine Quinlan, dean of USC Libraries. “KCET [has] done remarkable work in tracing the historical relationships of our city to West Coast myth-making, global cultural exports and the poetry and politics of natural landmarks across the state.”
The partnership between KCET and USC Libraries started in 2011 when Nathan Masters, USC Libraries’ manager of academic events and programming communications, began to write illustrated blog posts on L.A.’s history.  
“Lost L.A.” investigates the expansive history of the region utilizing resources from libraries and archives, including documents, photographs and artifacts. Masters assumes the role of both storyteller and host by traveling to multiple locations and interviewing key historians about the local landmarks. 
As a child, Masters became fascinated with the past rurality of Orange County, particularly when oranges and farmland still dominated the landscape.
“I always had this understanding, that even a place that can seem so permanent, even your childhood home, [has a] transience to [it], there is a history that predates it,” Masters said. “For me, the emotional power comes from being able to explore the history of this region.”
The first episode of the upcoming season will explore Yosemite National Park. It will recount historical events such as the valley’s first settlement,  a 1970 riot that occurred in the park and the famous Yosemite “firefall.” 
“Yosemite is the lens through which Angelenos view the preservation of the American West and California’s natural beauty,” Masters said. “We approach [the park] that way, that it has an L.A. connection still.”
“Lost L.A.’s” third season will premiere on KCET and episodes will be available for streaming on different platforms. A sneak preview of the second episode will be shown at Doheny Memorial Library on Oct. 20.

Young Americans for Freedom, which is hosting Ben Shapiro, has spent approximately $1,000 creating a protest space for students during the event in Alumni Park. (Adriana Sanchez | Daily Trojan)
Students for Justice in Palestine released a new statement on social media Wednesday condemning the upcoming event with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro organized by the Young Americans for Freedom.
“We object to YAF’s endeavor to enshrine hatred as fact,” the statement read. “We object to USC’s callous disregard for marginalized students on campus. Above all, we object to this shameless attempt by YAF and its billionaire donors to push their dehumanizing political agenda.”
The statement follows concerns from SJP regarding miscommunication with Trojan Events Services about designated locations where the group will be allowed to protest. Assistant Department of Public Safety Chief David Carlisle said the University is not planning to block off any parts of campus during the Shapiro event. DPS is encouraging students to protest in areas away from Bovard Auditorium to avoid violence. 
YAF has also spent an estimated $1,000 on creating a designated protest space, which will most likely be at Alumni Park, YAF chairman Maxwell Brandon said. There will be fencing at the space to separate those attending the event from those protesting to avoid potential problems, he said. 
“They can protest all they want as long as they’re not getting violent,” Brandon said. “Unfortunately the school felt it was necessary based on past history at these events where people in our position have gotten violent.”
SJP said they will still protest at Tommy Trojan during the event. 
In the statement, SJP added that by allowing Shapiro to speak on campus, the University is disregarding the well-being of its students. 
“As long as USC provides a platform for these ideas with students’ money, they enable violence, too,” the statement read. “Violence that we have a moral obligation to respond to, even if we do not experience it firsthand, and violence that we must protect ourselves from, when we do.”
The statement was tagged with the hashtag #SoundTheAlarm, which was used in a similar statement shared by the Black Student Assembly and other cultural assemblies last Thursday. 
The initial statement erroneously said that the University was providing funds to YAF for extra security and that K-9s and undercover police officers from the Los Angeles Police Department would be present at the event. However, that is not the case, according to DPS officials; DPS will be joined by “a modest amount” of LAPD officers at the event, while the rest of the officers will be on standby.
“It is our responsibility to assess the needs and provide sufficient resources to ensure the safety of members of our campus community and event participants,” DPS Chief John Thomas said in a statement to the Daily Trojan last weekend. “Our role is to make sure that all parties on campus may safely exercise their first amendment rights in accordance with university policy.”

Young Americans for Freedom initially recieved $4,100 from Undergraduate Student Government’s Discretionary Fund to pay for security. (Dariel Fillomeno | Daily Trojan)
The Undergraduate Student Government may cut funding for a Young Americans for Freedom event featuring conservative commentator Ben Shapiro after the organization canceled tickets reserved by student leaders who criticized the event, fearing they would cause a disruption.
Screenshots of canceled tickets acquired by the Daily Trojan showed the names of student leaders in the Black Student Assembly, Latinx Student Assembly and Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment. The cancellation of these leaders’ tickets comes after the assemblies shared a statement with the hashtag #SoundTheAlarm, which criticized the University for “funding [an] event that threatens, dehumanizes, and endangers our communities.”
While the University did not fund the event, YAF did receive a maximum amount of $4,100 from USG’s Discretionary Fund. According to the fund’s guidelines, events that receive discretionary funding must be free for all USC undergraduate students.
“USG funding has a very strict policy guideline in which any event that is put on by a registered student organization needs to be free of charge and open to all USC students to attend,” USG Treasurer Hunter Quarteri said.
Quarteri added on Wednesday that the Campus Activities department of the Office of Student Affairs opened an investigation after learning of the ticket cancellations.
“Once I explained to them the situation, [Campus Activities] told me that they are now investigating this situation,” Quarteri said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I am told I will remain in the loop of what is happening as this investigation happens and will be told what the final verdict the department decides on.”
YAF chairman Maxwell Brandon said that he understands the funding rules and that he is not concerned that the USG funding will be revoked. He said the cancellations were to “mitigate problems of people coming in to intentionally disrupt” the event scheduled for Oct. 4 at Bovard Auditorium.
“We have fair reason to believe that the specific individuals were planning on … getting tickets to disrupt the event or getting tickets to obstruct people from going to the event,” Brandon said. “We do have some record of very specific people and those people were removed. We as an organization couldn’t care less what organization people are associated with.”
Brandon added that multiple canceled tickets were also from accounts with false names that included expletives and other descriptors, which indicated that they were not serious attendees. One of the users had reserved 14 tickets, Brandon said.
One student whose ticket was canceled had encouraged others in a group chat for Latinx students to “reserve as many tickets as possible to shut [the event] down.”
“[Shapiro] denies racism and is transphobic [and] islamophobic, and we shouldn’t have to put up with that on our campus,” the student wrote.
SAGE co-Executive Directors Anya Kushwaha and Rosa Wang said that YAF’s decision to terminate their entries to the event was “discriminatory in nature.” Kushwaha and Wang shared the #SoundTheAlarm statement and both had their tickets canceled. They said they plan to compare the people whose tickets were canceled with those whose did not, in order to provide proof of discrimination. 
“Seeing a feminist organization that is often discounted and targeted by people who don’t think that [these] issues are necessary … and because [I have] a ‘typical Asian last name,’ I feel like they went off of those characteristics and canceled my ticket,” Wang said.
Brandon said, however, that he does not care what organization attendees are from, and invites those with differing opinions to attend the event.
“But there’s too much work going into the event to risk having a large number of people coming in to disrupt the event when we have reasons to believe that’s what their plan is,” Brandon said.
Soon after the SAGE co-directors found out their tickets had been removed, LSA co-Executive Director Eloisa Campuzano said she and Assistant Director Andra Astorga had their tickets canceled as well. Campuzano said she originally planned to attend the event but was also concerned that it would attract “potentially dangerous people” to campus.
Shapiro’s talks have prompted protests and violence in the past. Last year, multiple people were arrested amid protests at UCLA and UC Berkeley.
“As a student leader, I feel responsible for the community, especially for their safety,” Campuzano said. “And part of that includes being in spaces where I may not be comfortable, but where I can be there in case something does happen.”
Now that she can no longer attend the event, Campuzano said she plans to participate in a protest scheduled on the same day, but is unsure what action LSA as a whole will take to address the ticket cancellations.
“I do think it’s important to address that this is unfair, especially since a message wasn’t put out concerning the cancellations. They were just canceled,” Campuzano said. “It does call into question whether this event is inclusive or exclusive and what that means in terms of funding.”
Brandon said YAF only canceled certain tickets to ensure that the event can proceed without  disruption. He told the Daily Trojan earlier this week that the organization allotted $1,000 to add a space for people to protest outside of Bovard Auditorium, and that he hopes people who disagree with Shapiro come to listen.
“The rule is if you disagree with Ben Shapiro, you get to go to the front of the line because it makes for a lot more interesting event,” Brandon said. “We don’t want an echo chamber in Bovard. We would much prefer it to be a good mix of different, diverse ideas.”
BSA leaders declined to comment to the Daily Trojan.
