It’s safe to say that the 2013 season has been nothing short of disappointing for the USC men’s volleyball team. A year after a 26-7 run that saw them fall just one victory short of an NCAA title, the team, hampered by inexperience and inconsistency, has limped to a 6-16 record. But as the regular season winds down, the Trojans still have a chance to end the campaign on a positive note.
Building for the future · Though the Trojans won’t be advancing to the postseason, the team has plenty of youth with room to improve. Sophomore Joey Booth (number 19) is one of 18 underclassmen on the roster. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
On the heels of a 3-0 home sweep of Cal State Northridge Saturday on Senior Night (25-23, 25-22, 25-19), USC will conclude its season on the road this week with matches against UC Santa Barbara on Wednesday and UCLA on Friday.
While the final two contests appear trivial for a club simply playing out the string of a lost season, USC head coach Bill Ferguson emphasized the importance of the games as measures of where the team stands heading into next season.
“We have two games to improve as a team, and I know it sounds funny since we have only these two matches left and no playoffs,” Ferguson said, “but we talked to the team about using these two games to wrap our minds around a postseason-like situation, where we’re playing two matches in three games.”
With graduating seniors Chris Trefzger and J.B. Green making rare starts, USC recorded its third sweep of the season Saturday. Trefzger and Green played a memorable final home game as Trefzger notched 37 assists and seven digs as setter while Green played in the libero position and notched two digs. Sophomore outside hitter Cristian Rivera was strong once again with 18 kills while hitting .500, and fellow sophomore Joey Booth recorded 13 kills to go along with six digs.
“I think the team played as one [unit] the best we’ve had all year,” Ferguson said. “A big part of that was the fact that we started Trefzger and Green, who normally don’t start much. Having those guys start really galvanized the team, because they are examples of guys who do the right thing every day, and the other guys on the team really respect them. That allowed them to answer the call tonight.”
In a tightly contested match that didn’t leave much room for error, the Trojans’ hitting put them on top, as they hit at a .418 over CSUN’s .256.
“Our pin attackers played great matches,” Ferguson said. “Booth, Rivera and [freshman] Alex Slaught played great matches, and I think they did a better job of paying attention to video this week. We had Rivera be more aggressive, leading to key points, and [junior] Tanner Jansen had a great game on the right side. We knew that we were going to have a good matchup, so I think the guys were prepared to do well.”
As the season winds down, Ferguson avoided evaluating the team’s performance this year, noting that even the final two matches, as unimportant as they might seem, can retain value for the squad heading into the offseason.
“We have two games in three nights,” Ferguson said. “The semis and the finals are a day apart, and the Final Four is a day apart, so this is like a practice run to prepare us for the next season.”

“I hate to say this, but I think [USC’s football team] should go undefeated.”
That’s what ESPN radio host Colin Cowherd told USCFootball.com’s Ryan Abraham on Abraham’s podcast. Except he didn’t say it prior to last season, when the Trojans started the year as the No. 1 ranked team in the Associated Press top 25 poll.
Nope, he said it on Monday.
Let’s get something out of the way — Cowherd spews notoriously dumb and controversial nonsense all the time. He likes to stir the pot for the sake of stirring the pot, so I tend to take his strongly-worded statements with a grain of salt.
Yet, to be fair, Cowherd does know his college football. He’s also a big fan of the Pac-12, particularly USC’s program, so I decided to rethink his claim.
On the surface, it seems absolutely insane. USC was the most disappointing team in the country last season at 7-6. The team lost to Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl, and now four-year starting quarterback Matt Barkley is gone. The Trojans don’t know who’s going to replace him yet.
With that in mind, expectations around campus are pretty tempered. Fourth-year coach Lane Kiffin is on the hot seat, and nobody is expecting him to pull off 11 or 12 wins, let alone an undefeated season. Any sort of improvement over last year with this overhauled roster would probably be received fairly positively, all things considered.
Yet, maybe Cowherd actually has a point. He alluded to USC’s schedule to defend himself, and he’s not wrong for doing so. The Trojans’ first four games are an absolute joke — at Hawai’i, followed by three home games against Boston College, Utah State and Washington State. There’s no reason why USC shouldn’t be 4-0 entering a road matchup against Arizona State on Sept. 28, also a very winnable game.
Then there’s the best news of all: no Oregon to be seen in 2013. USC’s toughest challenges will be at Notre Dame on Oct. 19 (certainly no cupcake) and home games against Stanford on Nov. 16 and UCLA on Nov. 30.
That Notre Dame game is perhaps USC’s biggest challenge. Though the Fighting Irish were blown out by the University of Alabama in the national championship, they bring in a highly ranked recruiting class and still have an incredibly stingy defense.
But this is a rivalry game, and that means you can throw almost everything else out the window. Notre Dame squeaked out a win against a Barkley-less Trojan squad last year at the Coliseum, but let’s not forget USC’s 31-17 victory in South Bend the year before.
Unlike the Trojans, Notre Dame has a brutal schedule that would seem to forebode a regression from 2012. The Fighting Irish play at the University of Michigan and have home games against Michigan State, the University of Oklahoma and Arizona State before taking on the Trojans. They’re going to come into a matchup against USC already battered and bruised.
The other thing to keep in mind? Despite the departures of mainstays like Barkley, wide receiver Robert Woods, center Khaled Holmes, safety T.J. McDonald and cornerback Nickell Robey, the Trojans are still very, very talented.
The quarterback position is in flux, and that’s what most pundits have honed in on. But for the first time in years, USC will throw out a talented group of running backs with unique styles of play. The Silas Redd/Curtis McNeal combination was supposed to provide a much-needed balance out of the backfield, but both were injured for long periods of the season. Redd now returns as the de facto starter and a senior leader. USC also brings back the formerly injured Buck Allen, plus two freshmen, one of whom — Justin Davis — has been lighting it up in spring practice.
Then there’s the rest of the offense: Tight ends with NFL potential (if Kiffin ever chooses to include them in his game plan), a wide receiver who could legitimately win the Heisman (Marqise Lee) and another with the potential to easily replace Woods (Nelson Agholor).
On defense, new coordinator Clancy Pendergast is installing a unique system that very well could crash and burn. But considering how much talent the Trojans have — especially on the defensive line — that seems unlikely. The defensive side of the ball appeared to bottom out last season, and I’d count on it rebounding.
With all that being said, I still don’t see USC finishing the season undefeated. I know, I know, really going out on a limb there. What I would say, however, is Cowherd’s vote of confidence might not be as crazy as it sounds. The Trojans, despite everything that happened last season, are still poised to be a potentially great football team. The odds are heavily stacked against them to beat Notre Dame, Stanford and UCLA, but why couldn’t they beat at least two of those teams?
Expectations are low for USC football right now, but they really shouldn’t be. I’m just surprised Colin Cowherd of all people had to be the voice of reason on the matter.

Could David slay Goliath? Could the slumping Trojans, fresh off a win over Stanford, topple No. 4 Cal State Fullerton in the teams’ final meeting of the season?
Swinging away · Freshman shortstop Brett Lacey laced an RBI double in the top of the second inning. He went 3-for-4 at the plate Tuesday night. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Maybe on a better day, but that’s an optimistic phrase to which the USC baseball team (12-20) is tired of clinging to. The Trojans traveled to Goodwin Field on Tuesday night, but fell just short to Fullerton, losing 6-4.
The Titans (29-4) are a powerhouse team. They’ve climbed the national rankings each time they’ve faced the Trojans this season and have only four blemishes opposing their 29-win record. For a Trojan team whose young potential talent has yet to be fulfilled, Fullerton represents what it one day might be.
To put an end to that notion, the Trojans sent freshman lefty pitcher Sean Adler, who has been featured often this season as a reliever, to the hill for his first collegiate start. Adler, who had previously shown a glimmer of success over a near-invincible Titan team as a closer, looked to help his team capitalize on its Sunday win, which stanched a four-game losing streak.
It initially seemed that the Trojans really would prove that they could beat any team on any given day if all the pieces fell into place, something that USC head coach Dan Hubbs has frequently pointed out this season.
Two of USC’s freshmen helped the team jump ahead early, attempting to reverse the Trojan curse of being unable to get runners home.
Infielder Blake Lacey got the first run across the board with an RBI double and would lead the team in hitting Tuesday night, going 3-for-4 with two RBIs.
In the very next inning, outfielder Timmy Robinson shredded the first pitch he saw to left field with a homer that gave Adler a two-run cushion.
But it wouldn’t be nearly enough.
To his credit, Adler aptly handled the Titans for all of 2 2/3 innings before he completely collapsed, allowing the surging Fullerton offense to break open the floodgates. After allowing consecutive singles, Adler gifted the Titans a bases-loaded opportunity by hitting the next batter. Immediately following, he surrendered an even more generous gift: a back-to-back grand slam and home-run combination that put the Titans up by three.
Hubbs yanked Adler off his brief starting gig for sophomore Nigel Nootbaar, who also had difficulty rescuing his team from a hellish inning. Nootbaar allowed a pair of hits and a walk that threatened to further blow open the inning but ultimately settled down for three more innings of scoreless relief.
With the lead squandered, USC desperately needed to respond to stay in the game but couldn’t quite do it.
The bases were never empty, and there were plenty of scoring opportunities by means of hit batsmen, a balk, hits and the occasional walk.
That’s not to say there weren’t some hopeful moments: A few hitters were able to push the count to 3-2  and the team recorded two productive sacrifice flies that cut their deficit to two.  Granted, those two RBIs came in a bases-loaded, no-out scenario in which the Trojans could have really packed a punch.
Winning Tuesday night — which didn’t seem infeasible for a while — would have been a tremendous victory for a young team still struggling to find itself.
But that didn’t quite happen, and USC now walks away looking for another chance to assert themselves, this time in a three-game homestand against Arizona State starting on April 12.
This team is so UN-clutch it is a joke. Bullpen is pretty pathetic. The three weekend starters are doing well with
the rest of the pitching staff more like batting practice pitchers. Hubbs needs to go after the season. Again a
national search must be done to find his replacement similar to basketball.

The injury-riddled USC football team took to the field for a limited-contact spring practice on Tuesday. The decision to practice without kneepads felt like a precautionary measure after last week, when the Trojans lost freshman safety Su’a Cravens for the summer and junior wide receiver George Farmer for the season.
In the swing of things · In a return to the practice field, junior wide receiver Marqise Lee (above) played well against a banged-up secondary, which is missing freshman Su’a Cravens and senior cornerback Torin Harris. — Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Still, head coach Lane Kiffin insisted that despite limited contact, the emphasis of Tuesday’s practice remained on maintaining physicality.
“We really wanted to just stay up, and a lot of times when you [practice without kneepads] everyone has to stay up, but still, it was a physical practice,” Kiffin said.
Tuesday also marked the first time since the beginning of spring practices that junior wide receiver Marqise Lee participated in full. After being sidelined and limited for almost four weeks with a knee injury, Lee virtually had his way with the depleted Trojan secondary. Lee routinely got open and made difficult catches, including a beautiful leaping grab down the right sideline during coverage drills.
And Tuesday was also a strong outing for the offensive line, despite some early struggles.
The first two snaps of a goal-line stand resulted in losses in the backfield for freshman running back Justin Davis; in the latter of the two, a breakdown on the left side forced Davis to stretch his run toward the sideline, where junior defensive tackle George Uko and sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams were lying in wait for a tackle-for-loss.
The offensive line recovered from the missteps from the goal-line drill, however. After the shaky start, the offensive line parted the seas for two Davis touchdowns, both of which were vertical runs between the tackles.
With the loss of last season’s leader and center Khaled Holmes, the offensive line was a question mark going into spring practice. However, Kiffin is pleased with the offensive line’s progress thus far.
“I think they’re starting to mesh and do some good things,” Kiffin said. “Obviously, we have a long ways to go, but it’s good to see.”
The line also held the trenches for three more passing scores, including a connection between sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler and sophomore wide receiver Victor Blackwell on an in route. Kessler also tossed a perfectly placed lob into the arms of sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor, who had made his way to the left corner of the end zone.
Agholor built on his strong efforts in last Thursday’s practice and brought a high level of intensity to Tuesday’s practice as well. Agholor has been ushered into the No. 2 spot following the departure of former Trojan wideout Robert Woods to the NFL draft. Agholor wasn’t as highly touted a recruit as fellow wide receiver Farmer, but he has settled in as one of the team’s top wide receivers this spring by virtue of his tenacity and tendency to lead by example.
“Effort is something I can control,” Agholor said. “Sometimes you can’t catch every ball, but running hard and finishing after the catch or running to the play, that’s something you can control. I try to do that to show everyone else that they can do the same.”
Following Agholor’s example will be important if the Trojans wish to finish spring on a high note. The Trojans have their final official spring practice on Thursday and wrap up spring with an exhibition at 1 p.m. on Saturday at the Coliseum.

Students and faculty gave an all-female panel of students a standing ovation after they shared personal anecdotes about influence their military service’s role in shaping their outlook.
Honor · Panelists discuss how their experience in the military has translated to their lives as students, sense of self and future goals. – Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan
More than 50 students attended “USC Women Who Have Served: The Military Experience from a Female Perspective,” part of the monthly Campus Conversation series hosted by the Office of Campus Activities. The Tuesday event, which was the final installment of the 2012-13 series, garnered one of the largest turnouts.
All of the panelists, who are enrolled as USC students this year, shared their reasons for enlisting in the military. Many of the panelists said they enlisted because they felt a personal responsibility that was instilled from family members.
“I didn’t come from a military family,” said Stephanie Soltis, a first-year masters student in the Marshall School of Business who served as a pilot in the Air Force in Iraq and Afghanistan. “My family always talked about the importance of public service. Joining the military was the best route to go to achieve that.”
Lauryn Riley, a first-year in the Gould School of Law and a coach for the women’s club rugby team, said political events during her teenage years drove her to enlist.
“I was in high school during 9/11,” said Riley, who graduated from West Point and served one tour in Iraq. “It was a formative time during my life, and I wanted to help out in anyway I could.”
Though their inspirations differed, all the panelists agreed that their experiences in the service instilled a strong sense of confidence and identity that continues to translate to all areas of their lives.
“I learned to accept personal responsibility in life,” said Charlsie Hoffman, an international relations-global business major who served five years in the Marine Corps. “I don’t feel like things are out of my hands, [and] I don’t make excuses anymore. The military has opened so many doors for me. I can do anything; it’s my choice and the military gave that to me.”
But panelists said that, while their time in the military was invaluable and rewarding, they also had to fight against stereotypes and gender-based hardships during their service.
“Some people think we are the weaker sex,” Riley said. “They think we are not physically or mentally capable of what we do, but I wanted them to understand that I was there on my own merit and fully capable of doing everything they could.”
The challenges didn’t end there, however. Many veterans experienced crash courses in death and grief, learning to cope while focusing on their own duties.
“My hardest challenge was the first time anyone under my command ever died,” Soltis said. “We knew it wasn’t our fault, but you feel that responsibility because it’s our job. I had to figure out how to deal with that personally and be a good leader for the crew. And I was only 25 years old.”
The veterans said they face a new set of challenges in civilian life, as well. Casey Whitson, an MBA student who is currently on active duty as operations flight commander for USC’s Air Force ROTC program, described how she balances her life as a mother, wife, student and professional.
“I put the same effort into every part of my life that I do the military,” Whitson said. “You just have to be very disciplined, get things done, be focused and be a quality to your family when you are there.”
Many students walked away from the event inspired by the veterans’ stories.
“I know what it’s like on the other side,” said Keith Williams, a second-year law student at Gould who also served in the military. “To hear their personal stories from their perspective and know what they had to go through, it makes it a lot different because I can envision it from personal experience.”
Those who have personal relationships with the panelists said they see how the panelists’ military experience is reflected in their civilian lives.
“I found it to be very enlightening and [I was] surprised at what they need to go through balancing personal lives and being in service, and [I] couldn’t imagine putting my life on the line,” said Naa Adei Mante, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering who is coached by Riley on the rugby team.
The panelists’ discussion also offered guidance to some students who are considering enlisting in the military.
“This is giving me a better idea of my decision,” said Rebekah Lee, a junior majoring in kinesiology who was considering enlisting in the military after graduation. “I really like how empowered these women are and that’s a big factor [in my consideration]. They found themselves and the confidence they found is really great.”
Though each student took away different lessons from the conversation, ultimately, panelists stressed the importance of military women being able to define themselves on their own terms.
“I don’t like to focus on [stereotypes] because it gives a sense of reality to them,” Hoffman said, referring to the misconceptions of women in the military. “I’d like people to focus on what you got from us today.”
I did not attend the panel and it does not indicate in the DT article, but I would be interested to know if the topic of sexual assault against women in the military was discussed and how the prevalence of it affected the panelists.

Researchers from USC’s Institute for Creative Technologies are slated to complete the development of their avatar system, which detects signs of depression, by September 2013.
“We [asked], ‘How can technology help clinicians in their work?’” said Louis-Philippe Morency, one of the principal researchers on the project.
Morency and his fellow researcher on the project, Albert Rizzo, answered this question with SimSensei, a system designed to detect signs of psychological distress based on analysis of facial movements and voice indicators.
Morency and Rizzo said they hope the prototype will see real-world use within the next two years, and they look forward to implementing this technology because it can be a valuable tool for sensitive patient cases.
Morency and Rizzo teamed up because they were willing to support one another through their research by sharing their expertise. Morency’s specialty lies in the technological side of the project, while Rizzo offers specialized skills in psychology.
Morency credits a large part of the project’s origin to Rizzo and his previous work in psychology, particularly with post-traumatic stress disorder.
“[Rizzo] had the idea of taking the technology and applying it to the medical world,” Morency said. “He’s been working really hard.”
Multiple scientists have contributed to this product over the past decade. They have pooled together their individual research, information and technology in order to create the avatar.
“The avatar itself had been started about 10 years ago because the technology that we were using now has been built over the last 10 years so, again, this is a team effort,” Morency said. “We started [SimSensei] a year and a half ago in October 2011. The ‘team-effort’ attitude is particularly evident in the breadth of expert fields used to work on SimSensei, with disciplines involving 3-D animation, writing and programming.”
Some USC students were involved in the project at a preliminary level. They conducted research to assist Morency, Rizzo and their colleagues but did not work directly on the technology or prototype. Morency said many postdoctoral researchers were particularly essential in the later stages of the project.
As the prototype release date comes closer, Morency said the team currently faces three major challenges before debuting their optimal product.
“One [challenge] is we developed a lot of the indicators of depression from the face and from the voice and integrating all of these, which is called mutual fusion,” Morency said. “The second big challenge is really about dialogue, which is the human deciding what to say next and giving feedback and listener feedback and these two aspects of dialogue. And [third], getting it right, which humans are extremely good at — first, the timing of things, and second, giving the right feedback and empathy at the right time.”
A pragmatist at heart, Morency also said that this first prototype might be imperfect, but its potential benefits can be very impactful for future patients who might use it.
“We’re realistic, and we’re not going to solve all of [the problems]. But we’re looking to push it forward,” Morency said. “We’re keeping it together.”

Viterbi School of Engineering’s Information Technology Program announced Tuesday the addition of a mobile app development minor, with hopes to prepare students for the growing mobile app development industry.
Coded · The new Mobile App Development minor in the Information Technology Program will provide students with the skills to succeed in the mobile app industry, including in mobile game programming. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The mobile app development minor comprises 20 units of classes within the information technology program. The topics range from mobile game programming to building high-tech startups.
Trina Gregory, a lecturer in the information technology program, said the department created the minor in order to attract students who are interested in designing and developing mobile apps, regardless of their major.
“We are hoping to attract students who want to develop mobile apps,” Gregory said. “This minor will complement many majors such as computer science, biomedical engineering, industrial systems engineering, communication, journalism, business and economics.”
Gregory said the industry has grown considerably in the past couple of years, and the minor includes ITP courses that help students gain knowledge about the mobile industry.
“I taught the first mobile app development course in spring 2009, [and] since then we have been developing and offering [more] courses,” Gregory said. “We hope to grow the minor and continue to add more classes to it.”
Additionally, Gregory said the new minor would be particularly lucrative for students looking to be employed in a variety of industries.
“It’s so exciting because it’s such a dynamic industry,” Gregory said. “It used to be that companies wanted web developers since every company had a website, and now companies want mobile apps. Companies in all types of industries need mobile app developers.”
Anjali Shah, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering, said the new minor would provide broad skills appropriate for many specific markets.
“Speaking from a biomedical perspective, so much of healthcare is transitioning to using mobile apps to help people monitor their health,” Shah said. “This minor is incredibly applicable and applies to all disciplines because everything is becoming viral and mobile.”
Some students highlighted the career benefits of understanding this minor.
“The use of mobile phones is becoming a huge part of the world’s everyday life,” said Katie Murphy, a freshman majoring in electrical engineering. “In order to make yourself more marketable or a more knowledgeable person, it would really be a great idea to have a basic knowledge of mobile app design.”
Kariah Davis, a freshman majoring in electrical engineering who said she would consider taking courses in the minor, said the new minor would be advantageous for students because it appears in several aspects of a students’ daily life.
“I do think it is a good thing for students with the way that the world is going now,” Davis said. “There’s apps on my phone, Twitter and Facebook. Viterbi offering it is just going to further that realm of technology, so I think it’s great.”

Even though bands create their images based on a certain sound or by conquering a particular genre, it’s always good to shake things up a bit. Experimenting with different music styles is always a risky endeavor, though, since no one — neither the band nor the audience — truly knows how the experiment will turn out.
Some bands base their whole image on refusing to conform to one particular genre — this can be seen in music from The Clash, Pink Floyd and even early No Doubt. Others stick with one formula and they generally play it out because that’s what works, as is the case with the Rolling Stones, AC/DC and Oasis.
This week’s New Noise looks at new music by artists that are daring to step out a little from their comfort zones, dipping their toes into different styles to expand their musical horizons. These types of artists have always been important to the music scene as a whole, for they personify the malleability of music as expression. After all, expressions change — so why can’t the music?
City and Colour: “Thirst”
On June 4, former Alexisonfire guitarist/vocalist Dallas Green will be releasing The Hurry and the Harm, the fourth studio album under his City and Colour alias. “Thirst” is the first single to be released from the album, and it’s definitely a step or 10 away from the dreamy acoustics that City and Colour had established as its sound.
Remember those TV commercials where people would be blindfolded and have to taste-test Pepsi and Coke? Well, blindfold your best friend, play this song after a Black Keys song, and see if they can tell the difference.
From the minimalist production, the driving drums, the simple-yet-insanely-effective guitars and the blues-y lyrics, “Thirst” sounds like a lost Black Keys song, a definite change from the alternative/acoustic rock style City and Colour is known for. Even Green’s voice sounds eerily similar to Dan Auerbach’s, minus the slight distortion.
Fortunately, the Keys-ish sound works wonderfully for City and Colour — by the time the song ends, you’re left thinking “that’s it?,” which is always a good sign. Green keeps things straight to the point and “Thirst” is definitely a song so good that your parched ears will have to hit the replay button (sorry, I had to).
Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine: “Hollywood Goof Disease”
Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine isn’t just a kickass band with an even kickassier band name, it’s the latest project put together by Jello Biafra, former idiosyncratic lead singer of one of California’s very own pride and joy, the Dead Kennedys.
The Dead Kennedys are the perfect pioneering examples of California’s manically epic punk scene, and the band was always known for Biafra’s intelligent, laugh-out-loud funny lyrics.
It’s one thing to be in a punk band and be political — it’s a whole other thing to go into politics. This dude is so hardcore that he actually ran for mayor of San Francisco and didn’t even do that bad, finishing fourth out of a group of 10 candidates.
Thankfully, even though the Kennedys broke up in 1986, Biafra has still been keeping busy and his work with the Guantanamo School of Medicine brings back the frantic snark that the Dead Kennedys were oh so great at shoving in our faces. “Hollywood Goof Disease” is off the band’s latest album, White People and the Damage Done. Biafra’s projects have always found him dabbling in different genres while still staying under the hardcore banner, and “Hollywood Goof Disease” follows in that vein.
The song is most definitely punk rock, but the country-on-speed guitar and drums give the song a psychobilly tinge to it that sounds like The Cramps gone super angry. The lyrics “Why don’t you just die?” have truly never sounded more appealing.
They Might Be Giants: “Icky”
Though Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine tend to dabble in different genres without losing their punk-rock footing, the veteran rockers of They Might Be Giants take things a million steps further and change up their genre and style with virtually every song they release and have been doing so since the band’s formation in 1982. The term “alternative rock” has never been more apt a label than for They Might Be Giants, especially in the literal sense — they literally alternate between numerous genres so often that it’s impossible to label them as anything else. The band’s 16th (yes, that’s 16th!) studio album was released recently — the 25-song (yes, that’s 25!) Nanobots is chock full of different genres that are expertly handled by the band.
Technically, any track off Nanobots would suffice for the purposes of our column, but for argument’s sake (i.e. closing eyes and randomly pointing at a song), we’ll take a swing with the wonderfully non-icky “Icky.”
The track is upbeat and painfully fun, a prime example of the lighthearted vibes that They Might Be Giants have always expertly kicked around. “Icky” also has a vintage, Kinks-like garage rock feel to it with the rhythmic guitars and drums and the flawlessly sprinkled harmonies backing up John Linnell’s breezy vocals.
With a gargantuan catalogue of 16 albums under their belt and 25 songs on their latest release, it might be OK to come to terms with the fact. They Might Be Giants most definitely are giants.
Transplants: “In A War Zone”
One of the many side projects of Rancid honcho Tim Armstrong, Transplants also features rapper Skinhead Rob (or Rob Aston, as I’m sure his mother calls him) and Blink 182 drummer Travis Barker. The group has also dabbled in various genres including ska, reggae, dub and hip hop, but has overall kept its punk sensibilities at the forefront.
A so-far untitled new album is set to drop sometime in May, and the band has released the first single from their album, “In A War Zone.” Now, it would be ridiculous to say that the song is too punk for a punk band, but with regard to the Transplants, “In A War Zone” is definitely harder than what we’re used to hearing.
The song is borderline screamo-metal and is more reminiscent of Rancid 2000 than anything related to the Transplants. Wasn’t “Diamonds and Guns” used in a Garnier commercial?
I guess this is the band making sure no other beauty product will want their music playing the background. Although, if someone could make this track work to a lip gloss commercial, that would be awesome.

Cookies might not the most health-conscious product to donate to underprivileged children, but according to the founders of Kuki Squared you can’t beat the enthusiasm that the distinctive square treats inspire in their young recipients.

“We get these photos from the kids who have received our cookies and there’s just the biggest smiles on their faces,” said Kuki Squared Co-Founder Barak Federman.
Kuki Squared is a startup company created by two USC freshmen, which donates a cookie to a child in need for every product sold.
“Kuki” is Swahili for cookie. But the business, run by Lambda Chi fraternity brothers Federman and Alexander Evans-Pfeiffer does not limit its donations to one geographic location. So far, the cookies have been donated everywhere from Africa to China to the San Diego Rescue Mission.
“We’re working globally right now — anyone that takes donations, we’re not limited to one place,” Federman said. “A lot of the places we choose are run by friends and family or we are put in contact with them by friends and family.”
The concept behind Kuki Squared evolved late last semester when the pair started discussing different ways to get more involved in the community.
“Alex and I were in Doheny studying for one of our finals,” Federman said. “We were just finishing up pledging for Lamba Chi so we had a lot more free time. We wanted to figure out what we could do with that time.”
They decided that they wanted to start a business, but they also agreed that they wanted to do something philanthropic.
“With him being a business major [and] me having a past business history, we wanted to use our time sufficiently and have an aspect of helping the community out,” Evans-Pfeiffer said.
Incorporating philanthropy into the business was especially important to Evans-Pfeiffer, who said he grew up in a household where giving back was heavily emphasized.
“I’d see my mom staying up working all day planning these charity events to raise money,” Evans-Pfeiffer said. “I didn’t understand what it was about as a child, all this effort, but then I started volunteering at all these events and it really made sense to me then.”
Taking inspiration from brands such as TOMS Shoes, which popularized the buy-a-product-donate-a-product approach, the duo decided to incorporate that model for their business. Still, they needed a product to sell.
After brainstorming ideas, Evans-Pfeiffer spoke with his mother about their idea. She mentioned that Cupcakes Squared, a San Diego-based bakery known for its square cupcakes, was starting an all-natural square cookie line. The pair thought about it: Square cookies? There was something unique about the idea. They contacted the owner, Robin Wisotsky, to see if she’d be interested in selling her products to them wholesale.
Wisotsky agreed and suddenly, Kuki Squared was in business. Currently, the company sells the square cookies in six flavors: Almond Apricot, Black and White, Chocolate Coconut Almond, Peanut Chocolate, Cranberry White Chocolate and Pistachio Cherry.
“My favorite thing about our cookies are how moist they are,” Federman said. “You take a bite and it just falls off into your mouth.”
Evans-Pfeiffer and Federman have utilized their contacts and the USC community in order to get the name Kuki Squared out in the public.
“We knew we could use our connections to get us going off the ground,” Evans-Pfeiffer said. “Lambda Chi has been really influential; we’ve sold on The Row and did really well. We’ve also been speaking to our economics professor [Mohammad] Safarzadah about optimal prices.”
Kuki Squared has also received celebrity endorsements, including friend and fellow USC freshman Patrick Shriver and his mother Maria Shriver, who tweeted about the company to spread the word about their business.
“Right now we’ve had tons of publicity,” Federman said. “At the Oscars they have a gifting suite that they set up. … Actors came and took pictures and tweeted about it to get our name out there.”
Though the business has taken up a lot of their free time, Evans-Pfeiffer and Federman said the experience has been completely worth it.
“We used to spend our time hanging out, going to the gym,” Federman said. “Now we spend it working on our company. It’s a great use of our free time. We really can see the direct outcome of putting our time into our company, and that’s really fulfilling.”
Evans-Pfeiffer and Federman have yet to visit the children who have received their cookies around the world, but they are working to try and visit them in person.
“Right now we’re talking about going to Lesotho,” Federman said.
For now, they’re happy spreading the word about their cookies and furthering their company along.
“As corny as it sounds,” Federman said,“for Alex and I, we just want to do everything we can to help.”

“The medium is the message.” The influential communication theory philosopher Marshall McLuhan has said that time and time again. This adage couldn’t be more applicable for the adult entertainment industry.
Porn star · Ron Jeremy, one of the most influential stars in adult films is vocal about the adult film industry. Though society often stereotypes adult film actors, Jeremy looks to open a dialogue about his chosen profession. — Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Stigmatizing the industry as a business of physical superficiality, society often stereotypes adult film actors as brainless or egotistical. But does this stereotype apply to Ron Jeremy — the most influential celebrity of the porn industry?
For someone who has made a career out of exploiting sexual intimacy, it is surprising how Jeremy’s persona contrasts the aforementioned label. Wearing a faded olive shirt and dusty Crocs when he visited USC on Thursday to speak on the “An Evening with the Adult Film Industry” panel, Jeremy communicated with personality, humor and modesty as he spoke to the Daily Trojan about himself, his life and his work.
 
Daily Trojan: Justice Potter Stewart defined pornography by saying “I know [obscenity/pornography] when I see it.” How do you define pornography, and do you agree with Stewart’s statement?
Ron Jeremy: It’s a media that is not [there] to give you a storyline, but it’s supposed to get you excited. It’s a socially defined value, as in the Miller Test. What could be perfectly normal in New York would be offensive in Alabama.
With the Internet, the community has gone crazy. Stewart’s definition cannot be applied through the Internet, as how can it be persecuted. It’s hard to say; one man’s pleasure can be another man’s obscenity.
DT: Is there a difference between performance art and pornography?
Jeremy: Not necessarily. Pornography has this negative connotation to it. A lot of filmmakers in porn do not like the word “pornography.” They call it adult material or entertainment.
I don’t really care. Again, I would call it both. … If performance art involves watching people cook, obviously it is not pornography. If a performance art involves genitalia to give you a boner, then that’s performance art with a dash of pornography. It works.
DT: Your career as an adult film actor began in the late 1970s. In your view, how has the porn industry changed in the last 30 years? Has it improved or has it worsened?
Jeremy: There’s too much to tell. It has worsened since there are now all these tests we have to take for every disease known to mankind. Back in the old days, HIV didn’t even exist. It [was a] fun-loving, hippy-dippy freedom-loving, sexual revolution, Woodstock, anti-Vietnam kind of attitude; it was part of the ’60s. As Richard Belzil said, ‘If you remember the ’60s, you weren’t really there.’ It got better because it became legitimate. Girls like Jenna Jameson made $17 million selling her company to Playboy.
Girls realized that this could be a big business. That was a good thing; it became big money. In Deep Throat, the actors made $16,000. Girls have gotten prettier over the years, since more girls want to do it. With that comes selectivity; girls only want to work with their boyfriends or girl-to-girl. Business has gotten a lot more technological. I saw the birth of VHS, then the DVDs, CD-ROMs; I’ve seen porn enter the modern age of technology.
DT: Throughout your years working in the adult film industry, what has been your best experience? Is there anything you would like to have done? Do you regret anything?
Jeremy: Working with Tabitha Stevens, Christy Canyon, Taylor Wane and Sunny Lane. They really enjoy the performance and make me feel really special. I don’t regret being in the industry — I’ve had a good time. Although I wished I would have checked my blood pressure enough, then I wouldn’t have had an aorta dissection.
 
Jeremy is highly aware of contemporary social issues and public taste. Fans and peers respect Jeremy not solely for the longevity of his career but for his desire to openly discuss his profession. His candor and willingness to engage in meaningful conversations and understand a differing opinion make him stand out among his peers.
Say what you will about pornography, but Jeremy, who stands tall (at 5’6”) is proud of his accomplishments.
And there is something to be said for his willingness to embrace his career and controversial profession.

Though the media has been flooded with talk about the perceived nuclear threat of North Korea, it appears as if the United States and South Korea have little to worry about at this stage.
Yes, there have been some troubling reports. According to NPR, the North Korean military has successfully tested very small nuclear weapons on a few occasions. In addition, the regime of Kim Jong-un has also unsuccessfully tested long-range ballistic missiles — in the 2006 test, the missile blew up shortly after launching, according to The New York Times.
North Korea’s unsupported threats have sparked panic about a possible nuclear war. Since the long-range ballistic missiles don’t work, however, the regime cannot place the nuclear munitions inside of them — showing that North Korea has no way to launch nuclear weapons against South Korea, the United States or any other part of the world.
Combined with the fact that the United States and South Korean armies are far superior than that of North Korea, this so-called “war” would be ended swiftly. If there was a war, then United States-led military forces would easily sweep past the demilitarized zone and into North Korea in a matter of days, according to Foreign Affairs.
Though Kim might have a sizeable infantry force, he does not have modern tanks, artillery, aircraft or enough gasoline to fuel his war machines, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ website.
And in the event that the North Korean army actually attempts to launch a missile, the United States is ready to intercept any weapons aimed at Japanese, Korean or American targets, according to The New York Times.
Though Kim is undoubtedly delusional about his military might, he still appears to have a modicum of self-preservation. The United States and the world should seize upon this weakness — perhaps Kim could be granted some kind of safe haven — and use this opportunity to create sweeping reform in North Korea.
Yes, Kim and his regime are responsible for a serious humanitarian crisis within the country. By setting up concentration camps and starving the North Korean people, Kim and his cohorts have become war criminals. The global interests of justice and alleviating human suffering will better be served, however, if the surviving and starving people of North Korea can be freed from oppression through semi-peaceful means.
At this point, however, there is no use in fretting over a potential nuclear war. Even if Kim decides to take military action, South Korea has the United States and many other nations on its side. For now, countries need to continue peaceful discussions with the communist country, instead of pushing tensions closer to the breaking point.

Odds are you are correct that North Korea will stand down, but Kim has already won the propaganda battle in his own country.  He has to show strength and leadership to his sheeple, all the while playing the victim to the big bad West who “threatens” their existence.  It is easy to dupe a huge population of hungry peasants who hear and see what Kim wants them to hear and see.
You overlook the role of China.  While the relationship between N Korea and Chima is not what it once was, China does not want an American influence on its border.  China has yet to state what it’s response would be if war were to break out.
As Foreign Affairs newsletter reader, you have been duped into believing some falsehoods. NK wouldn’t attack the South with their army. They csn easily detonate an airburst nuke causing an EMP pulse that would render electronics useless. 
They also have the backing of the Soviets and communist China. 
The US Air Force and Navy can take out the NK Air Force in <100 hrs, but NK has a significantly greater number of soldiers than South Korea and US combined. Their assault can be won due to sheer numbers of ground soldiers.
You got some things wrong in this article… North Korea’s long range missiles are untested, but they do have mid range missiles that are proven to work and can reach South Korea.

As a figure upheld for his tolerance and politically correct take on the world, President Barack Obama has taken an incredible amount of heat from critics for a comment he made last Thursday at a fundraising lunch in Atherton, Calif., at the Democratic National Committee.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
While praising California Attorney General Kamala Harris as “brilliant,” “dedicated” and “tough,” Obama also slipped in that she “happens to be, by far, the best-looking attorney general.”
By the indignant public backlash over the comment, one would think that the president had denied the Holocaust’s occurrence or used some sort of racial slur. Not the case. Instead, Obama’s mention of Harris’ physical attractiveness is being criticized as sexist.
Such a response to the president’s comment is a counterintuitive overreaction in that it only reinforces the prevalence of sexism in the modern age.
Despite Obama’s flood of high praise for Harris, a longtime friend and political supporter of his, the focus on the attractiveness comment completely overshadows his clear admiration for her character and success as a lawyer and California’s attorney general.
It is true that the president’s introduction of Harris would have been more than sufficient without the quip about her physical appearance, and the argument that Obama’s “best-looking attorney general” comment was inappropriate is a strong one. But focusing on this one poorly placed comment regarding a successful woman who also happens to be beautiful only perpetuates the blatant sexism that the comment’s critics are decrying.
These critics claim that acknowledging a woman’s physical attractiveness objectifies her and causes people to perceive her as just a physical body lacking in substance of character.
In an interview with CNN, Siobhan Bennett, president and CEO of the woman’s advocacy group She Should Run, claimed that the public’s likelihood to vote for a female candidate “drops like a stone” as soon as her physical attractiveness is mentioned.
Following this logic, Harris’ prospects in a rumored future run for California government must be slim.
Furthermore, in a piece for CNN, longtime contributor Ruben Navarrette argued that comments like this one would never be made toward powerful men. He claimed that the comment “objectifies a professional woman, and it is not something that you’re likely to hear said about a man with the same credentials.”
Many people, however, would beg to differ with Navarrette. Soon after Rep. Paul Ryan was announced as Gov. Mitt Romney’s running mate in the last election, for example, a popular Tumblr page was opened called “Hey Girl, It’s Paul Ryan.” The page, targeted toward young women, featured memes of Ryan making political statements that turned into romantic confessions.
Regardless of gender, then, even the most successful public figures have heard their attractiveness mentioned among their positive traits. Oddly enough, this has never been the thing to stop them  from ascending to power.
Though meant to empower women, criticisms such as Bennett’s and Navarrette’s grossly oversimplify the issue. Lauding a woman for her intelligence and success in the professional world should not mean that casually referencing her beauty should cancel out those other, deeper qualities. Physical attractiveness and success, as it turns out, are not mutually exclusive.
Women have historically had to overcome some daunting obstacles and prejudices in the workplace and in the political sphere, and to completely ignore this would be to fallaciously and prematurely dismiss the argument that Obama’s controversial comment was sexist.
With this considered, however, it is important to move past an automatic assumption that men do not recognize women’s power and professionalism.
To denigrate Obama’s comments equates to the automatic dismissal of a woman’s strength of character and accomplishments as soon as her physical attractiveness is mentioned. This somehow suggests that if a woman is attractive, she could not possibly be talented or intelligent or a great leader, or vice versa.
Such a characterization is not only an annoying overreaction, then, but itself a harmful insult to women.

Nice article, Sarah. I imagine Arnold probably heard comments along the lines of, “The most jacked governor in the US,” numerous times when he was in office. This is really no different, IMO.

We’re in the thick of the spring season, but what does that really mean? There’s a lot of talk about rejuvenation and all that jazz but, for the most of us, spring simply serves as a pleasant reminder that only a few more weeks of school remain before the glorious onset of summer.
(Maybe “glorious onset” is a bit precious considering that, for many students, the end of school just signals the start of grind-it-out internships or — even more terrifyingly — the search for employment. But the point stands.)
Still, there’s something a little special about spring, which is why it holds such a unique place in cultures all around the globe. And written lore is particularly kind to spring, probably because of all the literary themes that the season inspires. As Ernest Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast, “When spring came, even the false spring, there were no problems except where to be happiest.” Or, perhaps most fitting for the content of our special supplement, Leo Tolstoy wrote in Anna Karenina that “spring is the time of plans and projects.”
For now, let’s just assume Tolstoy wasn’t talking about class “plans and projects” and focus on other, more personal endeavors. That’s why we’ve put together a collection of stories that touches on the idea of renewal, of trying new things and getting inspired. Want to get more fit, learn to cook a new dish or clean out the clutter in your life? We’ve got that and more in the pages to follow.

Despite the number of farmers markets that continue to crop up across Los Angeles, the trend of locally-grown ingredients sold in a communal setting is nothing new.
Though people are more familiar with upscale shopping mall The Grove, the expansive market located just across the way from the glitzy stores is the first and original farmers market in Los Angeles. Founded on July 14, 1934, this first farmers market grew out of the idea that farmers from the surrounding areas (such as San Gabriel Valley and San Fernando Valley) could sell their crops at stands in one central location.
“Roger Dahlhjelm, one of the founders, had a vision to help out the farmers who were more or less struggling through the Depression try to market their crops,” says Brett Arena, archivist for the A.F. Gilmore Company, which owns the land on which the farmers market operates. “It was his idea to try to get them to come down to the corner of Third and Fairfax, which was a vacant lot, as well as to invite artisans – weavers, cobblers and artists –  to come and sell their wares.”
Dahlhjelm and his business partner Fred Becke approached Earl B. Gilmore, an oil mogul who owned the empty lot, according to Arena. “Gilmore’s own father was a farmer, so he loved the farmers market idea,” Arena noted.
On that fateful Saturday nearly eighty years ago, 18 vendors – 12 of whom were actual farmers – descended on the lot to sell their crops and produce. “The farmers showed up and they were charged 50 cents a day to sell their crops and Roger Dahlhjelm was the man who ran the show,” Arena says. “Soon, stalls were being built with canvas stretched over wood frames and these little stalls began to pop up after the market started.”
Today, more than 200 farmers markets take place each week in Los Angeles. Though produce stands continue to dominate many of these farmers markets, a number of vendors also specialize in other, more exotic, goods.
For instance, Chris Reid and Rhett Melbo, two twenty-somethings from San Diego, make frequent trips up to Los Angeles to sell oysters.
“We have to wake up at four in the morning and get to the warehouse in Carlsbad. We leave there at around 5:30 a.m. and head up to get here at 7 a.m. so we’re ready to open shop by 8 a.m.,” Melbo says.
Reid and Melbo spend much of their time selling their products at farmers markets (especially at the Hollywood Farmers Market, held on Sunday mornings), but the dynamic oyster duo also hosts a variety of events all over Los Angeles and supplies major bars and restaurants, such as L&E Oyster Bar in Silverlake.
But at the end of the day, a lot hasn’t changed for such vendors since the days of the original farmers market.
“We’re just an outdoor market shucking oysters,” Reid says.
And in that vein, farmers markets continue to support many smaller businesses that benefit from the crowds that arrive at the markets each week. Soledad Goats, a cheese stand run by Julian Pearce and his wife, Carol, serves as a perfect example.
“We were milking a herd in the U.K. of about 1,200 goat and we were selling liquid milk when we thought, ‘why don’t we start making cheese?’,” Julian Pearce says. “I’ve had experience making cheese since I was three years old, and there was a demand for it.”
The couple has 15 years worth of experience working with goats, and six years ago, they came to America to try their hand at crafting cheese. The duo visited Northern California, but ultimately saw more opportunity in Southern California and set up a dairy in Mojave.
“Northern California has a lot of goat farmers and a lot of cheesemakers who are all very successful. So why go with the crowd when we could do our own thing? We put a little herd of about forty goats together and now we’re milking around 300,” Julian Pearce says.
In addition to its original goat cheese, Soledad Goats also carries a number of uniquely flavored cheeses, including honey and lavender as well as tangy garlic and red-bell-pepper cheese.
But above all, Pearce prides himself on the principles his small business runs on, chiefly the no-kill policy that stands on his farm. “We are rescuers as well… we have a very humane farm and people say how magical it is,” he says. “We have dogs, sheep, chicken, goats, cows — all of them together in the same yard, and everyone’s happy.”
That policy is just one of many that differentiate farmers markets vendors from commercial producers. And whether the vendors are selling fruits or flowers or even oysters, you’ll find that an astonishing number of hours are put into each of these humble market stands, including the time it takes to personally raise livestock or crops as well as hours spent transporting products back and forth, from one farmers market to the next.
Though some markets, such as the Atwater Village and Los Feliz farmers markets, are somewhat farther away, there are also farmers markets located right in USC’s backyard.
Both the Pershing Square Farmers Market, which takes place every Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and the Downtown LA Farmers Market, held every Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., are just short Metro rides away from campus.
And if you aren’t feeling very adventurous, USC has its own farmers market every Tuesday along University Avenue, right off Jefferson Boulevard. The market boasts fresh produce, kettle corn, pupusas and baked goods.
So take advantage of the warm weather that spring brings and make sure to visit at least a couple of these markets. Whether you’re looking to stock up on groceries or simply suddenly get a sudden craving for goat cheese, you’ll likely find something new and delicious to fall in love with.

People talk about “spring cleaning,” but a single bout of organization, nor one motivated trip to the Container Store, leads to long-term success. Organization requires the ability to let go of things that no longer have a place in your life or environment, and cleaning up can inspire a more positive mindset and help fade anxieties on top of merely opening up floor space.
Regina Lark, a professional organizer in Los Angeles who has appeared on Hoarders and has written a book about organization, sat down with the Daily Trojan to share advice and analysis on cutting clutter this spring.
WHERE DOES IT START?
“Most clutter is a decision to not make a decision,” Lark said. “As a result of the delay, it will just start piling.”
And people who are disorganized tend to be  messy for one of two reasons. One, Lark says, is an inherent lack of mental organization.
“A lot of people are born with that part of their brain kind of tweaked,” Lark said. “Getting to homework on time, getting to class in college and not having the adult in their life going, “Get dressed!” — it can be a train wreck. These people will miss classes, appointments and deadlines.”
The other reason is the presence of a major life transition — like leaving for college. The transition from high school, where many have “structure by default,” to college can be chaotic for many.
“All through high school they have been able to keep their stuff together just because someone was at home preparing meals and their level of responsibility to the world at large was pretty minimal. They had someone picking them up and dropping them off,” Lark explains. “Then, they transition to college and it’s all on them.”
Whatever the source, the big problem with clutter, Lark says, is that once people become disorganized, they feel too overwhelmed or unsure of themselves to clean.
“It becomes much harder to control once it’s taken a joy ride in your dorm room,” Lark said.
But the best way to break out of complacency is to set hard, tangible deadlines, which create more pressure to get things done.
“One strategy is to understand that the word ‘later’ is not on any calendar,” Lark said. “If you’re going to do it later, define later. Say when something will be done.
“It creates a different kind of commitment because it gives you an opportunity to see the bigger picture of all the tasks you must complete.”
She also recommends keeping office supplies and other tools (such as kitchen utensils, hardware, etc.) to a minimum: “Only use what you need.”
Moreover, Lark says that a messy room can reflect an equally messy state of mind.
“Clutter can be a physical manifestation or representation of the crap in our head. When you feel good about yourself, your space looks good,” she said. “If you don’t feel good — you’re not attracting the attention of someone you want to attract or not getting the grade you wanted — it’s also reflected in your space.”
This isn’t something unusual for on-the-go millenials, who often struggle with keeping tasks and important information arranged neatly amid stimulation overload.
“Everyone I know is plagued with this, but if you’re between 18 and 25 and you’re in a situation where you’re a small fish in a big pond and everyone has friends but you, you will build up an amazing array of head trash – or psychic debris.” Lark said. “Before we know it, we can’t even find our socks, let alone our last assignment.”
HOW DO YOU CHANGE?
The strategy to deal with this is simple: Less is more.
“What I keep in my life are the things that uplift and elevate me and serve a purpose in my life right now,” Lark said. “I don’t want anything in my space that I can’t look at and have a nice feeling about.”
A good strategy is to only bring things home that you can use. Lark says to always ask ‘when’ you’ll need whatever it is that you’re taking or purchasing.
“I work with a lot of faculty and they tell me that they go to a lot of conferences, where they always give you bags of things,” Lark said. “What these brilliant people sometimes forget is that you don’t have to take these bags with you. There’s just a bunch of conference bags on the floor.”
Students should particularly avoid bringing home t-shirts, pens, bags and flyers that they won’t use. Lark also recommends setting limits on the amount of time you hold hold onto an object before throwing it away.
“For example, at the end of each semester, decide which schoolbooks you really aren’t going to need,” Lark said. “I work with adults in their 60s and I’m uncluttering their college papers.
While there’s no set strategy that applies to everyone, Lark says it’s important not to hold onto anything, especially gifts, out of feelings of guilt or obligation. In other words, it’s OK for the recipient of a gift to get rid of a gift they won’t use, even if they like or love the giver of that present.
“Greeting cards are a perfect example: It’s sent to us to commemorate an event, a moment in time. It’s wonderful and lovely and thoughtful,” Lark said. “But life keeps moving forward and the moment has passed, as every moment does.”
Lark says possessions should reflect a person’s present self. Don’t hold onto items that might be useful in the future but might also never be used, and edit the amount of items held for their nostalgic value.
“You have to live in the here and now — and really be present in your life,” Lark said. It’s like we’re always looking ahead and always trying to hold onto the past.”
While all of this sounds good and well, cleaning is not an easy task. Intimidation and procrastination can keep people from clearing clutter. Lark said working with a non-judgmental, positive friend can help and, because so many people are disorganized on some level, you can usually return the favor.
“It can be fun — order a pizza and play music,” Lark recommends. “Just make sure you’re on your friends’ calendar so it does happen. It’s also better to clean with a friend because doing the work is so much more fun with another person.”
But above all, people have to understand that becoming organized won’t happen overnight — it’s can be a slow process, but one that can pay off in the long run.
“You have to change your behavior and change your thoughts. That has to work in tandem,” Lark advised. “Change is very possible. It’s going to require new habits and changing your relationship to stuff. If your new habit is to clear your desk every Friday, you have to get that first Friday under your belt.”

Spring is here, and what better way to celebrate the arrival of sunny weather than with a bowl of intense, beautiful chilled pea soup? This simple recipe utilizes a few versatile techniques that’ll serve you well even if you want to branch out to use other ingredients — gazpacho, roasted-tomato soup or even fancy pureed sauces to serve with meats or fish all follow the basic formula.
Ingredients (serves two generously):
2 cups fresh peas (sugar snaps, snow, English)
1 10 oz. package frozen baby peas
1 leek
1 small shallot
Handful of parsley (or basil)
Approx. 2 cups chicken stock
Water to adjust consistency
Two strips bacon
Cream or sour cream
 
First, the peas: the sweet seeds come into season in spring, which means that any farmer’s market (and many supermarkets, for that matter) should have fresh peas for sale. The money- and time-saving secret here, however, is that the soup also uses frozen baby peas.
That might sound like the antithesis of fresh spring cooking, but are you really ready to sit down and shell a bunch of peas when the flash-frozen alternative does the job just fine? Didn’t think so. If you can taste the difference, you are the 1 percent.
But before we get to that, put one small saucepan or pot over medium heat and one larger pot full of water over high heat. In the smaller vessel, cook off two strips of bacon until crisp; set aside for garnish. Drain off the bacon fat — bacon fat is usually a treasured thing indeed, but the fat congeals in cold soups — and add some olive oil.
Throw in one chopped leek, one small chopped shallot and a pinch of salt; the heat should be on medium-low so the vegetables can sweat, or cook without browning, and retain their sweetness. Once everything starts to look tender and gets a bit translucent (about five minutes), pour in about two cups of chicken stock (homemade is best, but any premium boxed or canned stock works fine) and simmer for about 10 minutes.
The pot of water should be coming to a boil any minute now, and when it does, toss in a generous quantity of salt — the water should taste like the ocean. Salting the water not only seasons your peas during cooking but helps them keep the vibrant, emerald-green color that’s critical to the soup’s appearance.
Now blanch (quickly boil) a 10 oz. package of frozen baby peas along with a couple handfuls of chopped fresh sugar snap peas, snow peas and some shucked English peas, if you find some. The sugar snaps will take the longest to cook, so add them first; toss in the rest of the fresh peas after a minute or two and the frozen peas a minute after that. Everything should get deep green and cook through in three or four minutes total.
Add a handful of parsley — or, if you don’t like parsley, basil leaves — in the last 20 seconds of cooking. A bit of both herbs would be a great option, too, but in any case don’t leave fresh herbs out altogether. The astringent, flowery freshness of parsley or basil really adds a subtle counterpoint to the sweetness of the peas.
Drain the tender peas and herbs and add to a blender. Warning: Make sure not to fill the blender more than about halfway, as all that hot vegetable matter will splatter out the top if there’s too much! To the blender, add the simmered leeks and shallots and a ladleful of warm stock. Start blendin’ — if it won’t run smooth, add some more broth and pulse till the mixture begins to turn. The soup should have about the consistency of a smooth milkshake when you’re done blending.
Now, time to get fancy: get out a mesh strainer and set it over a large bowl that’s been placed inside of a larger bowl full of ice. This will chill the soup down fast and help maintain a bright color. Slowly pour the contents of the blender into the strainer and gently tap, stir and scrape until only a blobby mass of green leftovers remain.
(By the way, the leftover pea mush can be used, especially in pea-stuffed ravioli. That’s not just some desperate idea — star chef Daniel Boulud suggests doing so in a video demo of pea soup with Julia Child.)
If you really want to go into Michelin-starred chef mode, repeat the straining process, being even gentler in pushing the soup through the mesh. The more you strain, the smoother and more luxurious the texture of the soup gets.
Now behold the shimmering, silky elixir resting in the bowl: your soup is almost done! Adjust the consistency of the soup by adding cold water, if necessary, and taste for the right level of salt. Put the soup in the fridge to finish chilling; serve with an artsy drizzle of olive oil and heavy cream or sour cream, some crumbled bacon and a pinch of fresh-ground pepper. A spoonful of reduced balsamic vinegar also does wonders, if you’re feeling ambitious.
This might look like a lot of work for a bowl of soup, but keep in mind that many of these steps can be done in advance. The soup refrigerates well, so making a batch a day or two in advance of an anticipated date is a perfectly fine thing to do.
You can simplify things even further by cooking the peas in a single pot with the leeks and broth instead of blanching them separately, though this might affect the color a bit. And feel free to make a pea sauce instead of a pea soup out of this recipe. Basically, just reduce the amount of broth so the puree is thicker, then strain and serve warm (one recommendation: replace the parsley with mint, then serve with grilled lamb and a sprinkle of bacon. You’re welcome.)
And even if you don’t like peas, these basic techniques — taking main ingredients, cooking them and pureeing it all with some type of liquid — form the foundation of all smooth soups and pureed sauces. People love tomato soup, but you can save money by making your own gourmet version at home: Just roast some ripe tomatoes and onion until soft and caramelized and blend with chicken stock and heavy cream.
Root vegetables also work great with this formula. Oven-roast some carrots or beets in foil, then season with salt and puree with a tiny splash of broth of even just water; strain through a mesh filter. It looks gorgeous and tastes even better — the mellow, earthy sauce pairs brilliant with cooked seafood, especially crab.
And nothing makes a plate look more haute cuisine than a streak of puree. Put a big spoonful in a corner of a plate, then place the bowl of the spoon in the middle of the sauce and make a dragging motion across the plate. Arrange your meat or vegetables on and around the sauce and then bust out your phone, because is there any way you’re not Instagraming this?

College is an important time for growth in all areas of life, but perhaps no other organization on campus embraces the physical aspect of growth more than the USC football team. We asked some members of the team about any tips they might have along with some of the players’ favorite post-workout meals and pump-up songs.
CODY KESSLER
For resilient redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, the key to a successful workout is winning the mental battle. “You have to come in with a mindset. A lot of people will say they want to workout and say they want to lift, and there comes that one lift where you feel like you’re too tired and then people quit. You have to be mentally tough,” Kessler says. For post-workout meals, Kessler advises “healthy-fat foods and stacking up on protein.”
Senior offensive guard and 6-foot-6, 300-pound friendly giant Kevin Graf believes balance is key for those with daily workout regimens. “For guys who want to get big, don’t do upper body every day. Do some legs. One day should be upper body, the next day should be lower body,” he says. While working out, Graf’s favorite track is Dada Life’s “Kick Out the Epic Motherf–ker”; for post-workout food, Graf prefers the omelets at Jacks N Joe.
Freshman phenom athlete and running back Justin Davis takes the “pain is gain” route to working out. “You gotta approach it with the mindset to get better. It’s going to be hard but you just gotta work through it ‘cause in the end, it’s going to pay off,”  Davis says. “You want pain when you’re working out, because that pain’s going to get you better.” For post-workout meals, Davis is an unabashed carnivore: “Definitely have to go with tri-tip or steak, with potatoes. A bunch of protein always helps.”
Redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard took a workout cue from a documentary on a former NFL great. “The best thing is to do twenty push-ups each commercial when you’re at home,” Pullard says. “Switch it up with sit-ups. That’s what I watched in the Herschel Walker 30 for 30 [documentary], and that was a big help.” As for post-workout food, Pullard will spoil himself from time to time. “Nachos—with Doritos, though, and ground beef. With extra cheese and extra sour cream. Totally unhealthy. And about ten sugar cookies. And a side order of cheesecake,” Pullard says, laughing. To get ready for games and workouts, Pullard listens to Pastor Troy’s “We Ready.”
The tall, lean freshman quarterback Max Browne has plenty of zip in his throws due in no small part to an incredibly strong core. “For me, size and mass isn’t as big of a deal but making sure your core’s tight, because all lifts, especially Olympic lifts, start and end with your core. So if you build from there out, that’s definitely beneficial,” Browne says. Browne’s favorite post-workout food is a special from a restaurant in his home state of Washington: “fried rice with chicken on top and tons of teriyaki sauce.”
Freshman defensive tackle and Rivals.com five-star recruit Kenny Bigelow stresses that diet and exercise go hand-in-hand. “You gotta eat, you know, you can’t just lift all the time. You gotta eat, you gotta run,” Bigelow says. Bigelow gets his post workout protein from Muscle Milk and prefers to eat fruit after a practice or workout. Bigelow also has an appreciation for a wide range of music; his favorite pump-up track is Aerosmith’s “Dream On.”

Downtown Los Angeles — 1988. Los Angeles has one of the highest crime rates in the country. The average freeway trip takes about 15 minutes. And smog is intolerable.
These are a few of the facts characterizing the city when Nicole Yorkin wrote a 14-page article for the Los Angeles Times Magazine projecting what the city might look like 25 years from then.
Jerry Lockenour, an adjunct professor in USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering, saw the article when it was first published. He clipped it and he saved it. Today, he is teaching the article in his class as a way to help students understand how science and technology affect the future of development.
“It’s on-target in many cases and off-target in some, so I use it as a case and point of how hard it is … to predict the future,” Lockenour said.
For example, Lockenour noted how the article predicts smog would be excruciating by 2013. But though air quality needs to improve in Los Angeles, it’s not nearly as bad as the prediction suggests.
“This article predicts that smog in 2013 would be horrible — it would be eye-watering,” he said. “So they missed that one completely.”
And visually, with the exception of a few new buildings, the city’s skyline has not changed much since Yorkin’s article was published.
“To bulldoze Downtown and make it suddenly something different is a major, major undertaking,” Lockenour said.
Yet Lockenour, who has lived in Los Angeles since 1977, said that many things on the ground level have changed dramatically over time. One big example? In the ’70s, Downtown L.A. was a place for work; now it’s increasingly becoming a place to live.
“I think back to when I first came to L.A. [and] there weren’t that many people living in L.A,” he said. “There’s a lot more high-density housing now in Downtown Los Angeles where people are choosing to live.”
In recent years, Downtown L.A. has attracted growing numbers of young, educated and affluent residents, according to Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, an assistant professor at the Sol Price School of Public Policy and an expert in municipal development.
“They are also associated with the attraction of lots of businesses and amenities,” Currid-Halkett said. “So what you have is a sort of symbiotic relationship between the increase of amenities and the increase of a young, educated work force and then also the firms and businesses that want to employ them.”
As Currid-Halkett pointed out, one of the biggest changes in Downtown L.A. has been the proliferation of shops and properties geared toward leisure. Walking through Downtown today, this trend is hard to miss: Specialized markets to upscale cafes, all which largely cater to young residents, now scatter the street corners.
“L.A. Live created amenities. The Arts District created interesting social happenings. The whole redevelopment of Downtown has attracted lots of different people to want to live down there, which in turn brings a more diverse residential group,” she said. “It just developed into a much more amenity-rich area with things to do and interesting people who live there.”
In September 2012, the New York Post sparked the interest of talking heads with the publication of a story sporting the headline, “Los Angeles is the future,” and a declaration that “New York, better watch your back.” The article surmised that Los Angeles would become the nation’s premier city by transforming itself into a city with a real transit system and a vibrant food culture.
And in addition to ground-level changes, underground changes have affected the changing demographics of the city. Extensions to the Metro system have made it easier to travel throughout a city that is often cast as extremely stratified.
But with current plans, by 2016, Angelenos should be able to take a train from Downtown to Santa Monica. And by 2036, Angelenos should be able to take a train from Downtown all the way down Wilshire Boulevard into Westwood.
“We are steadily building out our network and with every extension of our service we create new connections — new opportunities — for Angelenos to leave their car to home and commute via transit rather than drive everywhere,” said Dave Sotero, a spokesperson for Metro.
Sotero said this has the potential to dramatically change the landscape of the city, transforming it into something resembling a city like New York or Chicago.
“It creates opportunities to live within close proximity of the transit line and also have various other amenities like shopping and commercial opportunities,” Sotero said. “That changes the profile of the Los Angeles region — it’s not typically known for that sort of environment, like Manhattan or other major American cities that have much more robust transit-oriented development.”
In addition to changes on the ground level and below, the skyline of Los Angeles may be poised to change in the coming years as more developments stream into the city. One anticipated development, slated for completion in early 2017, is a $1 billion renovation of the Wilshire Grand Hotel.
The project is expected to yield 900 hotel rooms, 400,000 square feet of office space and 45,100 square feet of restaurant and retail space. When completed, the 73-story building will surpass the U.S. Bank building as the tallest skyscraper west of Chicago. More importantly, it will be a new crown jewel in the skyline and could inspire more drastic developments in the near future.
Sean Rossall, a spokesman for the Wilshire Grand project, agreed that Downtown L.A. has changed dramatically in the last decade.
“Ten, 15 years ago, Downtown was a place that sort of became a ghost town after 6 p.m. and now there’s a very vibrant culture, food and a nightlife that is really attracting people, especially young professionals, as a place not only to work but a place to live,” Rossall said.
According to Rossall, the renovation of the Wilshire Grand feeds off of the recent changes and trends in Downtown Los Angeles.
“Being an iconic part of the skyline, having the best entertainment and dining venues in Downtown and being situated as the hub between the business district and L.A. Live is really going to make the Wilshire Grand a central part of the Downtown lifestyle and experience,” he said.
And development projects, ranging from hotels to residential housing, are cropping up all over the city.
“Downtown is actually going through really a development boom right now. There are projects proposed all over the area,” Rossall said.
But as an increasing number move into Downtown and as more businesses emerge, many emphasized the importance of creating a long-term plan.
Patti Berman, president of the Downtown Los Angeles Neighborhood Council, said her group was awarded a $122,000 grant from the Southern California Association of Governments to compile a plan for the neighborhood.
“We are looking at experts in that area to take a look at what will make downtown more livable, more sustainable and what type of mobility we need,” Berman said.
Currently, Berman said many residents come to Downtown L.A. when they are young but leave after having children.
“That is something we want to change drastically,” she said. “We can’t have a community without families and children.”
Rather than addressing sweeping issues, Berman said the emphasis of the plan would be on tackling the “lower-hanging fruit” and coming up with doable projects.
“It doesn’t do any good to put together these plans if you are just going to put them on a book shelf. And there are plenty of them on bookshelves, trust me,” Berman said.
I must express some appreciation to the writer for rescuing me from this challenge. Because of checking throughout the world wide web and meeting ways which are not powerful, I thought my entire life was well over. Existing minus the approaches to the difficulties you have solved all through your good guide is a critical case, as well as ones which could have in a wrong way damaged my entire career if I had not discovered your web blog. Your main ability and kindness in taking care of all the things was priceless. I am not sure what I would have done if I hadn’t encountered such a point like this. I’m able to at this moment look forward to my future. Thanks for your time very much for your skilled and sensible guide. I won’t think twice to recommend your blog post to any person who ought to have care about this matter.

The video game industry is no stranger to controversy. Since the days of 2-D games like Mario, simulated violence has been accused of influencing real-world violent tragedies. Video games’ seeming impressionability got on the radar after the Columbine High School Massacre. According to the New York Times, it was discovered that the two teenage shooters had been recently banned from playing the violent computer game, Doom.
Those advocating restrictions on video games also cite the story of an Ohio teen who shot his father and stepmother in their living room after they took away his Halo 3 privileges as an example of the effects of  violence in games.
The latest criticism of video game violence, however, centers on animal abuse rather than human violence. Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed franchise has come under fire from PETA and the Pacific Whale Foundation for the studio’s decision to add a whale hunting element to their upcoming pirate-based title Black Flag. The series, which boasts six titles for the central consoles, considers their games paragons of historical accuracy. The settings of the franchise have ranged from Jerusalem during the Third Crusade to Ottoman-era Istanbul, and from 15th Century Florence to the American Revolution.
The whale hunting featurette of Black Flag has been condemned “disgraceful” by PETA and “disgusting” by the Pacific Whale Foundation, who believe that the game glorifies the murder of whales. In response to the controversy, Ubisoft released a statement:
“Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag is a work of fiction that depicts the real events during the golden era of pirates…We do not condone illegal whaling, just as we don’t condone a pirate lifestyle of poor hygiene, plundering, hijacking ships, and over-the legal-limit drunken debauchery.”

The two teenagers that were banned from the video is one thing but what about the facts of their lives that may have curved them to shoot . What about that information. There is no proven link that the video game made them do it.

While the Michigan Wolverines may have lost to the Louisville Cardinals in the 2013 NCAA Men’s Basketball National Championship game, they can take solace in the fact that the school’s Fab Five took a big step toward reconciliation by all attending the game.
Four of the five members – Jalen Rose, Juwan Howard, Ray Jackson and Jimmy King – all sat together in the stands. The fifth and arguably most important member, Chris Webber, was also at the game, but sat in a luxury box away from his former teammates and best friends.
Before the game, there was a lot of speculation as to whether Webber would even show up, as he’s tried to distance himself from Michigan and his history with the school, according to Rose.
“I know you guys were surprised,” Rose told the media Monday night. “I am not surprised that he came. We’ve been friends since we were 12 years old.”
The Fab Five was Michigan’s highly touted freshmen class – Webber, Rose, Howard, Jackson and King – that helped change basketball over 20 years ago. The group wore long shorts (which was unique at the time), embraced hip-hop culture, played a flashy style of basketball, and oozed swagger and bravado.
More importantly, they led the Wolverines to back-to-back national championship games in 1992 and 1993, losing to Duke and North Carolina, respectively.
Despite their on-court successes, there was no fairy tale ending to the group’s tenure.
Webber, the unanimous star, began distancing himself from the university in 1993, after he called a timeout in the championship game against North Carolina when the Wolverines didn’t have any timeouts remaining.
The embarrassing late-game error resulted in a technical foul, which ended the Wolverines’ comeback and theoretically cost them the game. He’s never discussed it, and it’s widely speculated that the mistake devastated and tormented Webber mentally.
Then in 2003, the NCAA required Michigan to disassociate with Webber and three other players for 10 years, and vacate the Fab Five’s wins and accolades after an investigation found Webber and others guilty of NCAA violations.
The combination of failure on the biggest stage and disassociation proved too much for Webber, who had no choice but to separate himself from Michigan. Since then, he has all but denied any involvement in the Fab Five. ESPN recently did a 30 for 30 film about the Fab Five, and Webber was the only member who chose not to participate. These instances have been common and unfortunate, as Webber is clearly still upset about the situation.
Still, Webber was in attendance and tweeted out a photo of him in his luxury box wearing a Michigan beanie.
It seems like a small thing, but that’s significant. For one night, the Fab Five were reunited. They may not have all sat together and cheered on their team, but it was a sign that the conflict could finally be resolved in the future.
“I just wanted to let him (Webber) know and let the world know, we’re a family,” Rose said. “We’re brothers. That’s the great thing about team sports.”

The results of a Pew Research Center study released April 4 showed that the majority of Americans support the legalization of marijuana, but students and experts expressed a wide range of reactions to the poll.
Of the 1,501 American adults polled from March 13-17, 52 percent of respondents said they supported the legalization of marijuana while 45 percent said it should not be legalized.
The results highlights the fact that in the last 50 years, public opinion on the legalization of marijuana has shifted dramatically — a 1969 Gallup survey concluded that 12 percent of Americans favored the legalization while 84 percent did not support its legalization.
Recently, several states have made significant tangible strides in marijuana policy. In the November 2012 election, the states of Colorado and Washington legalized the use of marijuana through a majority vote. These new initiatives allow for individuals over the age of 21 to possess up to one ounce of marijuana.
With the Pew poll revealing that 65 percent of millennials support legalization, many students said they were not surprised by the shifting acceptance of marijuana. Janelle Bongiovanni, a junior majoring in public relations, said that the changing mindsets of younger generations toward legalization contribute to this dynamic shift.
“I think that it isn’t surprising at all,” Bongiovanni said. “In today’s society, it seems to be more accepted than it has been in the past, especially here in California.”
Ben Surbrook, a sophomore double majoring in East Asian languages and cultures and international relations, agreed with Bongiovanni, saying that the statistics follow a trend that has been developing for some time.
“The poll doesn’t really surprise me at all,” Surbrook said. “It seems like that’s the direction America is heading in.”
Studies have shown that legalizing marijuana could be a boon for cash-strapped states, who could regulate marijuana to create more revenue.
Hans Ecke, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering, said legalization’s financial benefits were appealing.
“I’m indifferent about it because it’s not going to change the accessibility [of marijuana],” Ecke said. “I’m kind of for legalization so California can tax and make some money off of it.”
Some students said they support the legalization of marijuana simply from a policy standpoint. Mica Biton, a junior majoring in biochemistry, said that marijuana’s illegality can often make it more alluring.
“I’m for [the legalization of marijuana],” Biton said, “simply, because with anything that is illegal, there’s going to be more efforts to get it than not.”
And Julie Michaelk, a freshman majoring in theater, was among some students that cited marijuana’s medicinal benefits as a big reason to legalize it.
“People are already doing it and there are medical purposes. I have seen the effects it can have on people in need and it’s beneficial,” Michaelk said.
Though many students supported legalization and the survey seems to show a high probability of marijuana becoming legal in the near future, recent history, at least in California, suggests otherwise.
In the November 2012 election, a majority of California voters rejected Proposition 19, which would have legalized possession marijuana. It was defeated with about 54 percent of the vote.
And some experts continue to express concerns about marijuana use. Professor and founding chair in the Department of Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy in the School of Pharmacy Joel W. Hay, for one, said he was not enthusiastic about the recreational use of marijuana in college.
“The sad thing is that young people suffer much worse outcomes,” Hay said. “Their brains are much more susceptible. The medical evidence is that they become addicted at much higher rates than older people. They are much more susceptible to the bad mental health outcomes.”
And for Hay, the purported negative effects of marijuana outweigh its positive impacts on society.
“Marijuana is essentially decriminalized — it’s less serious in terms of criminal penalties than a traffic ticket, so there aren’t any legal enforcement issues in this state,” Hay said. “Thousands of people are dying in marijuana related traffic accidents, other injuries and accidents. The downsides are enormous, the benefits are trivial.”
But as support for legalization continues to grow at record rates, it’s uncertain whether the downsides of marijuana use will be enough to convince the majority to maintain the federal government’s prohibition on pot.
There are more endocannabinoid receptors in the body than any other receptor type. The endocannabinoid system is a major regulator in the body implicated in almost all diseases including cancer.
It is a wonder that the push for legalization isn’t stronger.
