On the top floor of USC’s newly constructed John McKay Center, the coach reclines behind his office desk and sips coffee while waiting for his next staff meeting.
It’s the second week of fall camp for the Trojans, and Monte Kiffin has just settled into his new digs, conveniently situated across the street from the practice field.
There’s a whiteboard with a handful of indistinguishable scribbles and formations, a video screen and a coffee pot, but that’s mostly it.
Though the office is sparsely decorated, a wooden 4” x 6” photo frame at least provides a fitting centerpiece. It’s a gift he received a couple years ago from his wife, Robin — although he can’t exactly recall when.
Encasing a photo of his son, Lane, on his wedding day 12 years ago, the frame is engraved with the words: “Families are the rich soil from which we grow.”
It’s the type of family snapshot that would likely be found in a number of coaches’ offices.
In this case, though, the photo is also of Monte’s boss — or as he prefers to call him these days, the “head coach.”
Monte Kiffin, USC’s renowned defensive guru and assistant head coach, has been coaching football since the mid-1960s, when he was a graduate assistant at Nebraska. He served as a head coach in college — Arkansas in the early 1980s — and as an NFL assistant. Yet now, in the latter stages of an illustrious career that’s spanned nearly five decades, he still hasn’t left the sidelines.
Instead, he has joined his son, USC’s young but polished 37-year-old head coach.
As is evident, coaching football remains Monte’s obsession. It consumes him. Even at 72, as he begins his 47th season and fourth alongside Lane on Saturday against Hawai’i, he’s as motivated as ever. It’s what he knows.
“If you ever watch The Shawshank Redemption, and Brooks Hatlen is in the jail and they let him out, he doesn’t really know what to do because he’s so used to it,” Lane says of his father. “That’s how I always describe him. He’s so used to the inner office of football and how it operates that he wouldn’t want to be outside that.”
If Monte, who works roughly 12 hours each day and spends many nights during the season at the Radisson Hotel on Figueroa Street, is in fact stuck coaching, he doesn’t appear to be bothered by it in the slightest. In a peppy voice and with a revealing grin, he still talks about the camaraderie of a football team, and about watching players grow and develop from wide-eyed freshman to seasoned All-Americans. He longs for this. It’s as simple as that.
“Coaching is when you take pride in coaching and see a player get better from his rookie year to his second or third year,” Monte explains. “It’s exciting. That’s where it’s a lot of fun. As a coach, your job is to get them better.”

Making his young defense better, though, has been a prolonged process, even for Monte. In 2010, his first year in Los Angeles, the unit posted the worst statistical season in USC history, allowing 400 yards per contest. A year later, progress — if it could be called that — was slow. In late September, the Trojans gave up 43 points in a loss at Arizona State and then 41 points to Arizona, setting another school first — 40 or more points surrendered in consecutive weeks.
That prompted skepticism from the stands at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to various online message boards — all in spite of his pedigree.
“Monte Kiffin’s freaking old and needs to retire,” commented one fan on the Daily Trojan’s website. “His defense is outdated, and it doesn’t work against the spread … What we need is a young defensive coordinator from the college ranks.”
With USC firmly entrenched in the second season of a two-year postseason ban, frustrations grew, and the mounting consensus among a sizable portion of the fan base became this: The son had to fire the father — a hypothetical each Kiffin insists was never discussed.
“We never really talked about it,” Monte recalls. “You have to keep concentrating, or you’ll be screwed up. You can’t coach. Oh, I’m scared to call this [play].”
Naturally, Monte toes the line between being stubborn and being confident. The architect of the famed Tampa 2 defense, he helped guide the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a Super Bowl XXXVII championship while serving as their defensive coordinator.
“I’ve been doing this a long time,” he says. “I knew what we were doing. We were just very young. These guys wanted to do well; they just didn’t, and I take some of that responsibility. But I never really thought we weren’t going to do it. We were going to get better.”
There was little doubt, at least in his mind, that his previous success could translate to USC, which ended up winning six of its final seven games in 2011.
“I felt bad, at that time, for the kids and the head coach,” Monte recalls. “But I don’t feel bad for myself.”
 
υ
 
The father and son duo reunited three years ago. Fired by the Oakland Raiders after just 20 games, Lane quickly landed another gig, this one at the University of Tennessee. Looking to fill out his staff, he reached out to his father, who had just finished his 13th season as the Bucs’ defensive coordinator.
“It was a good situation [in Tampa],” Monte says. “So I had to think about it for a while.”
Lane, already carrying the reputation as a tireless recruiter, convinced his dad to move to Knoxville, Tenn. and to take on the same position with the Volunteers. Monte was sold on returning to a big-time college program. For as long as he’s coached, he has loved that environment: the sold-out stadiums filled with 100,000 fans, the tailgaters who wake up at the crack of dawn each Saturday, the close-knit family-type atmosphere, the pageantry of it all. He saw that in Tennessee, so he accepted the offer. Then, in no time at all, he found himself on a flight to Los Angeles after just 15 months with Lane on Rocky Top.
“We got there, I bought a home and then it’s one and done,” he recalls. “What am I doing here? I would’ve rented.”
So he turned in orange for cardinal and gold and followed his son, who had accepted the head coaching position at USC and replaced Pete Carroll.
“I didn’t really have a choice,” Monte laughs.
 
υ
 
No USC player’s relationship with Monte predates that of junior cornerback Nickell Robey.
During the summer of 2009, before Robey’s senior season of high school, he met Monte Kiffin at a camp at Tennessee, and received a scholarship offer on the spot.
Previously committed to Georgia, Robey hails from Frostproof, Fla. — about an hour and a half east of Tampa Bay — where Monte had made his name as a defensive innovator. So he knew full well about the coach’s pedigree. His late mother, Maxine, had been a Bucs fan. Robey’s cousin even played for Tampa Bay.
That is to say: A scholarship offer from Monte Kiffin carried a fair amount of significance in the Robey family.
“He was extremely well-known in Florida,” says Robey, who would eventually follow Monte to USC. “When he came to my school, people were like ’Oh that’s Monte Kiffin,’ taking pictures, things like that. I just realized how important he is.”
But no matter how important Monte becomes, his routine hardly changes. He wakes up early, drinks coffee, goes to staff meetings, talks to his fellows coaches, talks to his players, downs more coffee, goes to practice, watches film, goes to sleep, repeats the process. He’s always coaching.
“In most jobs, people work to get to retirement,” says Lane. “He wouldn’t enjoy that at all. This is what he enjoys.”
In Monte’s mind, he still has plenty of work left, too. Progress needs to be made. Though USC boasts eight returning starters on its defense and sits atop the Associated Press Top 25 poll, he insists more time is needed in order for the Trojans to build a national championship defense. So he tinkers with schemes and packages and talks to his players — he’s still concerned about their development.
“Whenever we do talk, I really can’t explain it,” Robey says. “It’s like we just know each other. Like I’ve known him all my life, and he’s known me all his.”
That is why Monte still coaches: for his players, his defensive family.
“You want to win for these guys,” Monte roars. “I’ve got two national championship rings, a Super Bowl ring, all that stuff. You know what, I want one for these guys.”
All of a sudden, he finishes his coffee, disposes his cup and then, almost immediately, pops up out of the chair behind his desk and bursts out the door to coach.
Nothing else matters.

There isn’t a single word that can accurately describe Bloc Party’s latest album, Four.
Wallflowers no more · Those that ignored Bloc Party through the years will have more difficulty doing so now. The band’s new album, Four, is louder and more unpredictable than its past releases. – | Photo courtesy of Press Here Publicity
The band’s most recent work is an eclectic and unpredictable collection of songs, an album with musical mood swings. The four U.K. men that make up Bloc Party — Kele Okereke (lead vocals), Russell Lissack (lead guitar), Gordon Moakes (bass) and Matt Tong (drums) — demonstrate on Four that they are capable of sounds that range from confusing yet strangely addicting to mellow and, at times, sweet. The band’s name — a play on “block party” and the political term “Bloc party” — has ignited controversy and even some hostility, but criticism has never stopped the band from releasing edgy and bold music.
Bloc Party’s genre blending is maybe best presented in the form of the album’s 12th track, “We Are Not Good People,” a commotion of crashing cymbals and screaming, punk rock vocals. Need a song to wake up to in the morning? This would be a great choice. It’s loud, with lots of guitar shredding and rebellious lyrics such as “We’re not good people / This is a warning.” Though it’s understandable that Bloc Party would end its album off with a bang, the band overdid it with this track.
Still, the eccentricity of the album is most apparent toward the middle of the album and grows a little stranger with each track. In “So He Begins To Lie,” features an underlying edginess that permeates, with a grungy, British approach and influence. Without any musical growth or variation in this track, Bloc Party is not off to a great start.
Elsewhere, clumsy lyrics like “First cut first / Pierce the skin / It binds us” (from “3×3”) make it seem like the band is trying (and failing) to create a goth-punk rock persona.
Then suddenly, amid tracks filled with dark lyrics, comes “Real Talk,” a track somewhere along the lines of Cali-punk rock, an ideal track for a road trip. Undoubtedly, it’s an unexpected transition from the previously harsher sounds. But even with its welcome mellowness, this track is forgettable, as if it was hastily thrown into the album as an afterthought.
But, after another vague song, “Kettling,” packed with political undertones and seemingly produced only to justify the band’s double-entendre name, Bloc Party finds its album’s musical calling. Cue “Day Four.”
With more of a mainstream sound, “Day Four” showcases the subtler vocals of Okereke who we’ve only heard scream, shout and whisper thus far in the album. And unlike the monotony of “So He Begins To Lie,” this track reaches a dreamy, pensive pinnacle: Lissack loops a starry riff and Tong keeps a steady beat as violins play in the background. It’s beautiful. It’s unique. It’s the kind of music that should have been on Bloc Party’s album all along.
Bloc Party ultimately redeems itself with “V.A.L.I.S.” an imaginative tribute to Philip K. Dick’s science fiction novel VALIS (Vast Active Living Intelligence System). Regardless of one’s familiarity with the book, the upbeat lyrics “Show, show, show, show / You gotta show me the way” are catchy and enjoyable. The creative reference also shows off the band’s playful side, a side previously inconceivable.
After hearing heavy metal rock for much of the album, it seems appropriate that “Healing” would be one of Bloc Party’s closing tracks. Taking it down a notch, Bloc Party delivers a slow-dance feel with smooth vocals and the gentle strums of Lissack’s guitar. “As life gets harder / Whatever strikes, you’ll heal / You will heal” are lines that serve not only to comfort fans who need some reassurance, but also as a reminder to the band that they will trudge on despite the criticism they might receive for its newer sounds.
An album with its fair share of highs and lows, Four is a musical enigma that showcases Bloc Party’s versatility. Four, in some ways, serves also as the band’s musical timeline, a chronological relic of how Bloc Party finally found its sound despite its initial duds. Though the album is far from perfection, its unpredictability feels genuine and rare.
well-written article. however, in 3×3, the song is about “group sex” or an “orgy” – therefore, the lyrics.

Niki & The Dove
Friday Aug. 31, at 8:30 p.m.
The Echo
Swedish electro-pop trio Niki & The Dove follow the May release of their album Instinct with a North American tour that launches Friday night at The Echo.
Since the group landed on the music scene in 2010, lead vocalist Malin Dahlström has drawn comparisons to Stevie Nicks with her vibrant style and mystic vocals on tracks such as “Tomorrow,” “Somebody” and “DJ, Ease My Mind.” Strong backings from keyboardist Gustaf Karlöf and drummer Magnus Böqvist give the trio a solid sound, even if they don’t quite measure up to the illustrious Fleetwood Mac.
Though the group has yet to gain much popularity in the United States, Niki & The Dove came in fifth place in the BBC’s Sound of 2012 poll, suggesting that the budding band is slowly gaining international recognition.
If you’re into the indietronica/electro-pop scene and have been looking for a new artist to spice up your iPod, Niki & The Dove is certainly worth checking out.
 
L.A. County Fair
Begins Friday, Aug. 31 at 11 a.m
Pomona Fairplex
With the long week ahead, take your time and explore a longstanding L.A. tradition.
Since 1922, the L.A. County Fair has drawn hoards of visitors looking for a belly-filling, fun-loving time.
The fair provides everything one could want for a wholesome weekend: miles of fried food, a zoo’s worth of live animals and, of course, a ferris wheel.
Pig racing and goat milking demonstrations appeal to those looking for a classic fair-going time. Less conventional options include olive oil and wine tastings, tunes from Gwen in Doubt (a Gwen Stefani cover band) and performances by the Chinese Circus of Beijing.
It might be a trip from the USC campus, but when you realize all you can pack into a day, the trip will seem that much more worth it.
Tickets are $12 on weekdays and $17 on weekends.
 
Street Food Cinema
Saturday, Sept. 1 at 6:30 p.m.
Port of Los Angeles, Block Field
Indulge in a food-truck picnic, sway to the retro-sound of musician JD Bender and catch a hilarious flick. Not a bad way to spend a Saturday night.
You can do it all in one place, too: under the stars at Bloch Field in San Pedro.
This week’s screening, Talledega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, stars ’SC alum Will Ferrell.
And if you’ve missed the summer’s events and can’t make it to Saturday’s festivities, fear not: Street Food Cinema has extended its season to Sept. 22.
General admission tickets are $10.
 
6th Annual Druid
Underground Film Festival
Saturday, Sept. 1, at 9 p.m.
Historical Monument 157
The Possession. Lawless. The Day. This weekend’s movie releases don’t offer much in the way of the unusual.
So if you’re in the mood for films about bathing cats, experimental police self-defense tapes or the “avant-weird,” take a break from Regal Cinemas and head over to North Broadway for the 6th Annual Druid Underground Film Festival. A $5 festival fee grants movie-lovers access to a screening of a series of shorts by a dozen filmmakers threatening to dominate the underground L.A. scene as well as a wacky hour-long mashup of random, sometimes creepy film clips.
But the festival’s not all about showcasing this year’s cinematic oddities. Legendary filmmakers Damon Packard, John Geary and Danilo Parra will be honored at the festival for their contributions to the world of independent filmmaking.
As DUFF blends comedy, horror and experimental film into one night of bizarre cinema, this weekend provides an escape from the ordinary.

There once was a female USC freshman who slept soundly in her dorm room. All of a sudden, she heard a rustle. She assumed it was just her roommate coming in late, as she usually does, getting ready for bed.
Unfortunately, this freshman was about to find out that her roommate was getting ready for bed — with a new friend she met on The Row. Needless to say, our freshman did not get much sleep that night.
Every difficult roommate situation might not begin this way. The first couple weeks of school are often a blast. With seeing old friends and meeting new ones, it seems as if everyone loves everyone else and can’t wait for the first football game.
But once the fevered time period known as Welcome Week dies down, the gleam of the first few weeks dulls. Sure, you have your friends and you’re still excited for that football game, but sometimes a more present issue persists: Your roommate is a psychopath.
For sophomores, juniors and seniors, this is really no fault but their own. What did you expect when you signed up for random room assignments after that first awkward freshman year?
But it’s always sad when a freshman gets stuck with a roommate who carries the emotional attributes of Norman Bates.
Some roommates can be just plain weird. Weird is fine. Weird is good. It might be a pain to try to be quiet when coming in at night because your roommate goes to bed at 8:30 p.m., but it’s a much better situation than living with a raging nymphomaniac.
But what do you do when you’ve been hit with the dreaded “sexile”? Here are some tips on how to deal.
Set some boundaries
Maybe your roommate isn’t aware of the rules of being a human being. That’s cool — just make sure to remind him or her right after the first time it happens. This is not the time to attack your roomie and pompously defend your argument. Instead, calmly let him or her know that you wouldn’t mind leaving the room for a little while — you just need more than a moment’s notice.
Work out a convenient system — and the sock on the door does not count. If you get the feeling early on that you’ll bring someone home from the 9-0, shoot your roommate a text as soon as possible. Most people have a pretty good idea of where their night is headed with someone within the first few minutes of conversing.
By getting on the same page early on, you guys can get off to a great start and avoid more incidents in the future.
Pick up a hobby
OK, so maybe the other tips didn’t work. You’ve reminded your roommate to be considerate of his or her primal instincts.
Not only has your roommate continued with his or her X-rated behavior, both the actions and the frequency have increased tenfold. And without even hastily sending text message to ask for the room, they’ve resorted to hooking up while you’re asleep in the next bed over.
In this case, you’re obviously dealing with a narcissist. And because a narcissist can’t remove their head from their own rear end long enough to breathe fresh air, chances are talking to them again won’t help. This is the time to take up a hobby that’ll take you out of the dorm. Running? Check. Late-night cooking at a friends place ? Check. Going to a movie by yourself at UV? Check.
 
Payback  
Perhaps you can live with a little in-your-face hooking up action or the incessant demands to leave the room. But once the situation escalates to the point where it affects your sleep schedule, grades and overall perception of other humans, it’s time to get dirty. If you don’t want to give them back a dose of their own medicine in a literal way, then get creative.
Every time you get back to the room, make a lot of noise as you’re getting situated — this is where a genuine-sounding “I’m so sorry!” comes in. Is he or she very particular about how clean you two keep the room? Mess it up.
Chances are they haven’t changed their behavior because they think that sex is nothing to get worked up about. Sex isn’t that big of a deal — for some. If you are personally offended by it, that’s fine too. Being a successful roommate is all about compromise.
Hopefully they learn to adapt their behavior. Maybe you should leave this article on their bed as a casual hint. Whatever they decide to do, try to not get too angry. Just think about the day they come home with that positive herpes test.

Instead of suggesting that people try to avoid the problem or seek immature eye-for-an-eye justice, why don’t you advocate for a mediation with an RA? The ResEd system exists for a reason. I’d rather that my residents come to me with their problems so that we can try to work to a solution, rather than just suffering silently — or not so silently bitching to their friends, creating a vortex of resentment. Talking to your RA is way less awkward than listening to squeaks and moans all night, I promise.

Los Angeles is home to a wealth of pop-cultural events, the leader of the pack being concerts. But with so many venues and artists to choose from and so little time, it can be difficult to narrow it down. Here’s a list of the must-hear concerts and must-see venues this fall, for all sorts of tastes.
FYF Fest:
Indie darlings, mark your calendar. Los Angeles’ leading indie-music festival, FYF Fest, is back Saturday and Sunday — and for the first time, it’s a two-day festival event.
The Los Angeles Historic Park-based musical extravaganza features headliners Beirut, M83, Refused and James Blake as well as smaller acts including AA Bondy, Chairlift, Sleigh Bells, Warpaint and Yeasayer.
The festival also offers a comedy lineup, which includes funnyman David Cross — best known as the infamous Tobias Fünke from Arrested Development — Brendon Walsh, Brent Weinbach and more.
Grab your fedoras and get ready to jam to the next big acts in indie music.
Tickets run for $89 and can be purchased at fyfest.com.
 
 
John Williams: Maestro of Movies
Esteemed composer John Williams returns to the Hollywood Bowl on Friday and Saturday to conduct some of his greatest cinematic scores.
The Los Angeles Philharmonic and special guest violinist Gil Shaham will play the legendary composer’s famous hits from notable films, such as Star Wars, Jaws, Indiana Jones and more.
But the music isn’t the only thing that is sure to make this concert spectacular; the Bowl itself is the perfect outdoor summer venue. So pack a picnic, crack open a bottle of wine and enjoy the remaining summer nights, all to the tune of Williams’ hits.
Tickets can be purchased at hollywoodbowl.com; prices vary.
Grizzly Bear
Alternative-indie band Grizzly Bear will make its way to the Greek Theatre on Oct. 10.
The band gained fame for its hit “Two Weeks” and for work on the Blue Valentine soundtrack. It also garnered a reputation for its signature sound: part experimental, part folk and melodic all the way through.
It is fitting, then, for the folk-infused Grizzly Bear to perform at the Greek Theatre, an outdoor arena in Griffith Park surrounded by greenery and a starlit sky.
There’s simply nothing like listening to a band matched perfectly with its venue, which is sure to be the case with Grizzly Bear and the Greek Theatre.
Tickets can be purchased at greektheaterla.com; prices vary.
Nocturnal Wonderland
Southern California has become a hotbed for top electronic dance music talent and equally impressive shows, and Nocturnal Wonderland serves as a perfect example of both.
Part of Insomniac Events’ annual themed festivals (others include Escape From Wonderland and Beyond Wonderland), Nocturnal consistently features some of the world’s best EDM acts: This year’s setlist includes the phenomenal trance group Above & Beyond, acclaimed Norwegian duo Röyksopp, Dash Berlin, Neon Indian and more.
The festival also flaunts six separate themed stages for attendees to check out, with epic light shows and pyrotechnics thrown in for good measure. Insomniac has cultivated a reputation for theatricality, and this show certainly will not be an exception.
One-day passes are $85 and can be purchased at NocturnalWonderland.com.
L.A.’s Jazz Scene
As New York’s legendary jazz scene grew, many top musicians looked to the West Coast as a place to break out of the 52nd Street routine and to find a new audience. Through that migration, Los Angeles became a jazz icon in its own right, playing host to a number of stellar clubs and even better musicians.
Thankfully for Angelenos, that hip scene has hung around. Though the music might not be everyone’s cup of tea, a jazz club can still be an intriguing choice for a date or an after-hours drink with a friend. Little Tokyo’s Blue Whale Bar hosts some of the best up-and-coming jazz groups as well as established pros: Even USC’s esteemed percussion professor Peter Erskine played a set there on Aug. 19.
The intimate space has the feel of an indie art gallery and offers classic drinks as well as a small food menu. And Hollywood’s Catalina Bar and Grill, a famous jazz club with a long tradition of top-notch tunes, also gives audiences a chance to see the best musicians on the West Coast. The club’s popularity makes it slightly pricey, with a two-drink minimum on top of entrance fees, but it’s worth it for a unique night out.

Being a Trojan is all about school spirit, especially on game days. This isn’t, however, your high school variety of spirit. We’re proud because we dominate in whatever area we set out to conquer: You know, Arrogant Nation and all that Spirit of Troy fanfare.
We’re expected to bleed cardinal and gold and shout the SoCal Spellout at the top of our lungs, and we do so gladly. Admittedly, we pay the most attention to football game days, but our dedication also applies to any sporting event. Supporting fellow Trojans is what makes our collegiate community so strong.
Since it’s fall and the end zone is begging to be entered, however, this will be your guide to having the best football game day that our fine learning establishment has to offer.
Anybody can buy a ticket and go to a football game. Fans across the country do it all the time. But to really have the full University of Southern California football experience, there’s a certain way to go about it.
Pro tip: You will be neither cool nor alternative by refusing to wear school colors. Even if you don’t want to mainstream it with your bookstore best, implement cardinal and gold into what you’re wearing. Nobody wants to be that awkward blue or green speck in the cardinal-dominated student section.
One of the most vital aspects of a successful game day is having close comrades to join you in pigskin-themed misadventures. Who else will help you find the tents giving away free alcohol or share a bacon-wrapped hotdog? A certain empowerment accompanies a walk through campus on game day, flanked by your friends and awash in the sounds of impending victory.
In that moment, you will know what being a Trojan means: invincibility as a result of genuine camaraderie and hard-earned pride.
Before heading out, it’s not a bad idea to indulge in a couple of drinks — provided you’re 21, of course. The objective of “pre-gaming,” as many undergrads refer to it, is reaching that point where everything is pleasantly fuzzy and your inhibitions are let a little more loose. That way, you can join the rest of the rowdy ’SC fans and not know the difference between sounding like a raving savage or a pumped-up student. It’s also beneficial to be involved with a school organization or know a family of alumni so that you’re granted access to the free food and drink found underneath the many Trousdale tents.
Game day offers a veritable smorgasbord of fine dining: chips and salsa, barbecue hot off the grill and food trucks parked outside the Coliseum. A beverage staple of game day is sketchy jungle juice, a delicious  alcoholic concoction that consists of whatever’s lying around. The variable nature of jungle juice can be both terrifying and rewarding, so beware. If you’re feeling slightly less adventurous, beer is always plentiful. You can find it in red cups, gold cups, coolers and especially in triangle formation on beer pong tables. Game day is never short on the booze.
The Spirit of Troy is definitely our greatest source of school pride, and for good reason — nobody can resist the thumping rhythm of “Tribute to Troy.” Starting at Heritage Hall and continuing to the Coliseum, the band always energizes the crowd with its slew of fan favorites.
Another important Trojan tradition is kicking the lampposts for good luck before crossing Exposition Boulevard. Whether it symbolizes us kicking the other team to the curb or forms tradition from a clumsy mistake, you must do it.
Choosing where to sit inside the Coliseum is more important than picking a lunch table in elementary school. For a USC student, there are really only two acceptable options: the Sundeck or the student section. Both are great choices because they offer different perspectives from which to view our team. Within these designated student areas, it is also tradition that with every touchdown, willing girls are tossed above the fans’ heads to match the number of points scored — who said chivalry was dead?
Watching our football team emerge from the locker rooms onto the field is a sight to behold. As the announcer introduces the athletes and the band plays the USC fight song, the stadium instantly fills with a tangible excitement. Our hearts race with those of the players because we know we’re the best and we want to show it. Some might call it arrogance, but we carry ourselves with confidence on the field, around the field and off the field  — because we’ve earned it.
Now that you’ve reached your Coliseum seat after a day of successful tailgating, all that’s left to do is watch the game, enjoy the awesome halftime show and leave the stadium flashing the victory sign.

Yoshinoya doesn’t have the most flattering reputation.
Great Asian cuisine takes patience and a sense of subtlety, which you can’t exactly achieve in a fast food restaurant. And if you want “faster” Asian food, Los Angeles is a metropolis notable for its vast variety of Asian restaurants offering a quick bite — be it sushi or a bowl of pho.
Bowls no more · When Yoshinoya expands beyond its beef bowl roots, the restaurant’s new dishes become inconsistent and generic. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
In contast, the Yoshinoya restaurant chain is widely considered the Taco Bell of Asian cuisine.
Now, however, Yoshinoya’s signature beef bowl has a classier option. The new Asiana Grill Yoshinoya, the latest in a run of fast-casual restaurants pioneered by restaurant chains such as Chipotle Mexican Grill, recently opened at the intersection of 30th Street and Figueroa Street, replacing the normal Yoshinoya previously at that location. The food is now cooked to order on the grill in an open kitchen, and the restaurant aims for dishes that are nutritious, healthy and low-fat.
Asiana Grill Yoshinoya gives customers a selection of exotic Asian flavors to assemble the way they prefer. This create-your-own menu concept is a departure from the meal-in-a-bowl service that Yoshinoya is famous for. Customers can now choose whether their meal is served on a soup, a salad, a bun (an odd option for an Asian cuisine restaurant) or a plate. The plate is the best value, with two sides along with a protein and rice, which you can replace with udon noodles or brown rice for an extra charge.
Customers can then choose among six different sauces to incorporate into the dish. The original teriyaki sauce is nothing to write home about, and the ginger snap sauce is comparable to a lemonade sauce if diners are inclined to take that direction. The gekikara sauce, however, has a nice kick without being too overwhelming.
The restaurant has been completely remodeled, giving it a chic, modern feel with bright green chairs and pale white walls lit almost entirely by natural light during the day. It’s rather generic, however — even a bit “corporate” at times. Fortunately, the restaurant is very pleasant and has an atmosphere that would lend itself to some studying now and then.
Still, the true test of any restaurant is good food and service. The servers are very affable and go the extra mile in explaining the process of creating your meal. As far as the presentation of the kitchen goes, however, the giant platters of prepared food don’t mix well with the grills, which are kept in the background. For a restaurant that has “grill” in the title, the grills should play a heavier role in the food-making process rather than just serving as a means to an end.
The charbroiled chicken is adequate, although the taste doesn’t quite reveal the benefit of the grill. The sauce seems slathered on rather than being cooked into the meat — resulting in a lack of additional flavor and an  unusually dry texture. In contrast, the rice is actually cooked well, fluffy yet firm.
The salad has the “lemonade” ginger snap sauce, which is a bit too sweet for a salad and needs some salt. The seasoned vegetables were not, in fact, seasoned, although the thin pickled ginger strips are a pleasant treat.
The overall effort in trying to combine the fast-casual aesthetic of Chipotle with a modern Asian-influenced vibe is commendable, but the whole meal and the feel of the restaurant are rather sterile; both lack any notable characteristic. Asiana Grill Yoshinoya’s simplicity has prevented it from establishing its own unique identity. At times, the food doesn’t even qualify as basic Asian fare; that is not to say that Asiana Grill Yoshinoya needs to imitate the other restaurants, but it instead needs to introduce new and exciting dishes for the public.
Asiana Grill Yoshinoya has the right intentions but an insufficient execution. Still, the new restaurant has a very nice, large space and a friendly crew and the hours are great for students out late, as Yoshinoya is open until midnight Sunday through Thursday and until 2:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday.

Chicken with Plums is the latest live-action collaboration from Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, the creative minds behind the 2007 award-winning animated film Persepolis.
Lovely leading lady · Golshifteh Farahani gives a captivating performance as Irâne, Nasser-Ali Khan’s forbidden love interest. Actors Isabella Rosellini and Matheiu Almalric also inhabit their roles beautifully. – | Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
 
Like its predecessor, Chicken with Plums is an adaptation of one of Satrapi’s graphic novels. With an appropriate balance of emotion and humor, Satrapi adds a delicate yet effective atmosphere of magic and fantasy to create a mesmerizing film of love, love lost and what motivates us to move forward.
The story begins with an argument between Nasser-Ali Khan (Matheiu Amalric), a struggling but nonetheless exceptional violinist, and his wife Faringuisse (Maria de Medeiros). The altercation between the two escalates to the point where Faringuisse destroys her husband’s prized Stradivarius violin, and when Nasser-Ali’s search for a replacement proves futile, he decides to confine himself to his bed, hoping he’ll die soon. (As though aware of audiences hoping for a happy ending, the film soon establishes that, yes, Nasser-Ali will die in eight days.)
Much of the drama of the film focuses on a reflection of Nasser-Ali’s broken spirit. Chicken with Plums, however, not only reveals what led to this point and what determined Nasser-Ali’s decisions but also highlights the reason he played the violin with such passion and concentration. Audiences see this elaborated through mesmerizing dream sequences that include a gigantic Sophia Loren and a conversation with Azraël, the Angel of Death. The audience also flash ahead to see what becomes of Khan’s two children after his death; his older child, Lili, becomes a grizzled femme fatale and his hyperactive son, Cyrus, moves to America and raises a nuclear family that seems worthy of a trashy American sitcom. These scenes have just the right mixture of pathos and melancholy to create something theatrical yet very personal.
The anchor of the film, however, is the story of Nasser-Ali’s youth and his romance with Irâne, played by Tehran-native Golshifteh Farahani, whom he was forbidden to marry. The audience follows Nasser-Ali as his broken heart leads him to marry Faringuisse in line with the wishes of his mother, Parvine, played by Isabella Rosellini in a brief but impactful role. Nasser-Ali’s uses that heartbreak, however, as motivation for his music, and the film suggests this is partially why he is able to play the violin so well.
This idea persists throughout the film and serves as its saddest theme: The only way that we can transcend our life through our creative talents is only after the loss of something important to us. This was also true of Persepolis, which focused on a loss of culture and family. But in Chicken with Plums, this theme speaks to the heart of an artist more so than a citizen’s.
The acting is strong across the board, and the film is very much carried by Mathieu Amalric in the lead role. He manages to portray a character that is arrogant and downright unsympathetic as very relatable, and as viewers come to understand Khan’s motivation, what originally seemed an avoidable end becomes the only appropriate one.
One issue with the film, however, is that it never really establishes how a man so renowned for his violin skills is still a struggling artist.
Strong performances also come from Farahani as Irane, and Maria de Medeiros as Faringuisse, a person who has every right to despise her uncaring husband yet still tries to find a reason to love a man she’s cared for since she was a young girl. Eric Caravaca as Nasser’s socialist older brother, Abdi, also helps brings some stability to the film.
Aside from the standout on-screen talent, Chicken with Plum’s setting also plays a heavy role in the film’s effectiveness. The film takes place mostly in the city of Tehran, Iran, during the 1950s. In comparison to the country’s perception in Persepolis, which depicts a fundamentalist hierarchy that clamped down on the freedoms of its own people, this is an Iran with a proud, liberal, fiercely independent middle class capable to Europe during those years.
The presentation of the city and the culture is beautiful yet tragic. In fact, the stylistic cinematography seems to reference the neo-Realism of 1950s Italian cinema, yet merges the style with a subtle storybook-esque aesthetic. In many shots, the backgrounds in the distance are illustrated, and the sky is filled with rustic watercolor hues, giving the sensation that the intention of the film is not necessarily a realistic presentation of life back then, but rather a personal recollection of a world that no longer exists as it once was.
Chicken with Plums manages to match the creative aesthetic of Persepolis and translates it into a touching and beautiful rendition of 1950s Tehran. With so many films from the region being politically minded, it’s refreshing to see a film that speaks to higher universal concepts of artistry and love.

In an effort to prepare students and faculty to participate in an international landscape, the School of Pharmacy and the Keck School of Medicine are launching the first of its kind Doctor of Pharmacy/Master of Science in Global Medicine dual degree program.
Rx · Pharmacy students now have the opportunity to train in global medicine under the new dual degree — as well as work in the USC Pharmacy. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
The program was created to meet the challenges of providing effective health care to a variety of communities and economies worldwide. A combined pharmacy and medicine curriculum gives graduate students the applied knowledge and experience they need to address not only global health crises, but also the social issues that come with these crises.
“We are very proud to introduce the new Pharm.D./MSGM dual degree program because we feel it will add to the diversity of our class, which already includes a variety of pre-health professional students, progressive degree students, and international medical graduates,” said Jennifer Yoohanna, a student services advisor for the program.
Dr. Elahe Nezami, co-director of the Global Medicine Program, said the program is expected to attract a mixed bag of students. The only academic requirements are an undergraduate degree with a 3.0 GPA minimum and a 1000 GRE score minimum.
“Having a diverse student population is always great, as it allows for a variety of experiences and personal histories for students to use when discussing pharmacy and health care in general,” Nezami said.
The program has already sparked the interest of potential students a few months after the official announcement of its creation.
“I recognized the importance that collaboration between health-care professionals from all over the world has on overcoming stigmas that prevent the ill from getting much-needed aid,” said Nassim Lashkari, a new Pharm.D. candidate and applicant for the program.
Students benefit from a collaborative curriculum from the School of Pharmacy and Keck and conclude their education with one year of experiential training. The clerkship will allow students to work in different specialties to gain exposure to the myriad of populations and settings in which they might work following graduation.
With more students being accepted to the graduate program, the School of Pharmacy and Keck expect a spike in admissions after in the first-year “trial.” They expect the program to expand vastly as they educate more pharmacy and medicine students about the variety of domestic and international opportunities the curriculum offers.
“USC prides itself on creating innovations in education that lead to innovations in our world,”  Nezami said, “and this dual degree certainly aims to uphold that same standard.”

USC Athletics, the Office of Sustainability and Facilities Management Services announced a green on-campus tailgating initiative Wednesday. The effort will be instituted this Saturday before the season’s first football game.
Go green · The initiative will recognize tailgaters who recycle plates and cups instead of tossing them on the quad, the university said. – Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan
Halli Bovia, USC Sustainability’s program manager, said the Tailgate Waste Diversion and Education program aims to teach tailgaters the tools necessary to create a more environmentally friendly campus on game day.
“USC students are concerned about their environmental impact,” Bovia said. “We’re just giving them the opportunity to do the right thing.”
Bovia said nearly 65,000 visitors to the University Park Campus for football home games generate nearly 13 tons of waste per game.
The new program calls for student volunteers to walk around campus before the game to educate tailgaters on how to divert waste they have brought to campus and encourage them to recycle and compost appropriate materials. Volunteers will make recommendations on how to reduce waste in the future, such as asking tailgaters to bring food in bulk to reduce the amount of plastic packaging brought to campus and suggesting the use of only reusable cups and plates.
Hannah Wyatt, a junior majoring in cognitive science, said it might be difficult for tailgaters to break their habits and clean up after games.
“It’s an interesting idea, but I’m not sure how it’ll work out,” Wyatt said. “People have been set in their tailgating ways for a while. After a day tailgating and at a football game, people aren’t going to want to clean up after themselves.”
The program has also allowed for the creation of new, more visible recycling and compost bins, along with more signage and banners to aid in identifying them.
New sustainability efforts will also include a Zero Waste Tailgate Certification Program, which will recognize tailgaters who have pledged to divert a minimum of 90 percent of their waste at tailgates. Certifying certain tailgaters is meant to set an example for others, ultimately creating a more widespread impact on campus waste.
“The education program is about getting people to do the right thing with what they already brought [to campus]. The Zero Waste Tailgate Certification is meant to help them make better choices from the start,” Bovia said. “[Tailgating] is a great Trojan tradition. We’re just trying to make it more sustainable.”
Brittney Gross, a junior majoring in English, said even if the initiative isn’t successful, the effort counts.
“Even if it’s just one or two people participating, that’s better than none,” Gross said. “All you can do is try.”

Late nights studying can actually have poor consequences for grades, according to a new study published in the journal Child Development by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Helena Seli, a professor of clinical education at USC’s Rossier School of Education, said that recent studies suggest that the human brain uses sleep specifically for learning and remembering information.
“Sleep studies are suggestive, not definitive, but there is enough experimental evidence to show that sleep helps to consolidate memories and learning,” Seli said.
In the paper, the researchers state that learning material becomes more difficult with a lack of sleep.
“Regardless of how much a student generally studies each day, if that student sacrifices sleep time to study more than usual, he or she will have more trouble understanding material taught in class and be more likely to struggle on an assignment or test the following day,” the researchers wrote in the paper.
The study also gave evidence that students who regularly obtain fewer than five hours of sleep tend to have a lower GPA.
Seli said sleep is important because it is crucial in the process of forming memory.
“As we sleep, our memories get consolidated and integrated with existing knowledge,” Seli said.
Stephen Los Baños, a senior majoring in communication, said he believes most USC students understand that sleep is crucial for their academic success. However, Baños also observed that students tend to study more at night, which effects their sleeping.
“However, often times, due to such things like bad time management, we do not allow ourselves to get into a regular sleep cycle,” Baños said.
Robert Abugel, a sophomore studying policy, planning and development, said he studies late into the night in the hopes of making up for lost study time during the day.
“I study more late at night because I’m busy during the day with classes and other obligations to friends,” Abugel said.
Seli, however, said leaving studying to one block of time can be detrimental because of the difference between mass and distributed studying. Mass studying is what students like to call “cramming,” while distributed studying is studying small sections of a topic over long periods of times. Mass studying has been shown to not produce long-term knowledge. In contrast, distributed studying paired with regular sleep allows students to learn new topics effectively and also consolidate this new knowledge  with proper rest.
Other research studies have been done in the past that provide more evidence supporting the point that sleeping less regularly, even if it is to study, causes poor academic performance.
“The Link Between Sleep Quantity and Academic Performance for the College Student,” a research study done by the University of Minnesota Undergraduate Journal of Psychology, shows results that suggest the more students sleep at night, the higher their GPAs are.

Recent research by Associate Professor of molecular and computational biology Don Arnold and molecular biology doctoral candidate Sarmad Al-Bassam successfully videotaped the movement of proteins within a brain cell, allowing scientists to study the inner workings of the brain — live.
The project initially made use of green fluorescent protein, which is responsible for causing certain jellyfish to glow, to record the workings of the brain. Scientists have been using GFPs to view protein movement in cells for many years.
Other members of the team included USC postdoctoral fellow Min Xu, who helped develop algorithms for analyzing the data, and Thomas J. Wandless, a professor of chemical and systems biology at Stanford University. The project was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Health, and the findings of the project were published in Cell Reports in July.
As a continuation of the study, Arnold is now working on imaging the structure that turns the proteins around when they enter each cell’s axon. He turned in a paper for publishing which is currently undergoing academic review.
Arnold said the idea of GFP kick-started his research.
“In 1995, GFP came along and all of a sudden you could look at things live,” Arnold said.
At the time, however, GFP alone could not produce any useful data for scientists aside from allowing scientists to view protein movement.
“We wanted to look at proteins moving around in the cells, and the problem is that these proteins move along pathways, and all these pathways are moving simultaneously in the same space,” Arnold said. “When you see a vesicle moving along, it is impossible to tell which part of the pathway it’s in.”
Arnold and his team began working on this project in 2008 to resolve this problem. The project aimed to block the pathway and then release all the proteins at once, in effect synchronizing protein movement.
“We came up with the idea of halting this pathway and seeing everything go through at once,” he said.
Al-Bassam was responsible for developing the techniques for synchronizing movement within the brain.
“We adapted a chemical-genetic strategy that was originally devised to control the secretion of small peptides such as insulin and the human growth hormone for synchronizing the proteins,” Al-Bassam said. “The challenge was finding the unique conditions for visualizing the movement of vesicles containing fluorescent membrane proteins within neurons, which are some of the most difficult cells to work with.”
The footage led scientists to discover some interesting facts about the inner workings of the brain.
“We found that rather than being targeted specifically to the dendrites, vesicles carrying proteins initially enter both compartments, but then are stopped and prevented from moving beyond the initial segment of the axon,” Arnold said.
The footage of a brain lit up with GFP stirred up interest among students as well as scientists.
Isabel Shen, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, said the video encouraged her to persue her own research.
“It’s easy to be told about protein movement in lecture; it’s hard to visualize the process,” Shen said. “Not only does this video demonstrate the technology available to USC faculty, it deals with a topic relevant to everyone in every stage of aging and brain development.”

With the presidential election less than three months away, President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney are effusively courting voters.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
 
Both have consistently addressed American Association of Retired Persons groups, labor unions, farmers and small business owners throughout their campaigns.
Unfortunately, most college students are not senior citizens, farmers, business owners or members of a labor union. Politicians today do not have to court young voters in the same way as these other groups because a large segment of youth fails to consistently show up to the polls and solidify their political beliefs.
Unless we, as young voters, make our political presence felt by getting more involved this election season, candidates will not address the issues that matter to us.
Presidential candidates must use their campaigns to maintain their respective party’s traditional stronghold groups, such as gun-rights advocates for Republicans and labor union groups for Democrats. But campaigns must also target key voter groups whose loyalties can shift in any given election. These groups include senior citizens, who consistently display a strong presence at the polls, as well as blue-collar workers and farmers, whose votes are critical in several swing states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. Failure to attract these voter groups could mean the difference between holding a corner office and the Oval Office.
Such groups are coveted by politicians in a way young voters simply are not — and logically so.
One of the hallmarks of the 2008 presidential election was that young voters came out in record numbers. Though that’s true, the numbers weren’t nearly as mind-blowing as one might think — 51 percent of eligible voters ages 18 — 29 voted as opposed to 49 percent in 2004.
On the other hand, 70 percent of eligible voters ages 65 and up voted in 2008, which was actually a decrease from 2004 when 71 percent voted. It doesn’t take a genius to see why, come election season, politicians are catering to older Americans while young Americans are left scrambling for leftovers.
Here are a few of the scraps that have been thrown students’ way this campaign season. Obama has emphasized that under his administration, the maximum Pell Grant award increased by more than $800 to its current maximum of $5,500 per year. Too bad $5,500 per year is hardly enough to cover a substantial amount of the cost of attendance at a public university, much less a private one.
Aside from that, the maximum number of years a student can receive a Pell Grant was recently capped at six years. Some might think six years is more than enough time to complete a bachelor’s degree; however, many college students must take extra coursework their first few semesters because of a lack of college preparation in high school or later on to meet rigid general education requirements.
Romney has managed to one-up Obama in his inability to court college students. Among the nominee’s pieces of advice to young people: Get as much education as you can afford, shop around for loans and borrow money from your parents to start a business. Romney’s so-called advice is arrogant and out-of-touch. Though not every college student comes from a low- or middle-income background, this particular advice lacks any sense of empathy or compassion toward these large groups.
Most importantly, by advising young people to get only as much education as they can afford, Romney is further hindering social mobilization in a country where it is already lacking.
Secondly, shopping for student loans isn’t as simple as shopping for clothes.  Rather than make snotty remarks, Romney should require private lenders to increase transparency so students are not signing loans they cannot clearly understand.
Clearly, young voters are not high on the presidential nominees’ priority lists, but we can change that.
Let’s go out to the polls this election — and every subsequent election — in truly record numbers. We have to start keeping up with the 65 and older crowd if we’re ever going to get any attention around here.

Transportation
In her Aug. 22 Daily Trojan article on transportation options, Carrie Ruth Moore includes a few incorrect or incomplete points that I would like to correct.
The primary point I wanted to correct was regarding the LA Live Shuttle. This shuttle service was operated by USC Transportation but completely funded by Anschutz Entertainment Group, the owner and operator of the Staples Center. When the Metro Expo Line opened in April, AEG discontinued that service, primarily because the Expo Line runs more reliably, regularly and for longer hours daily than the shuttle.
Ms. Moore does also mention the Expo Line but identifies only two of the three stops near USC. There is a third stop adjacent to the University, the Expo/Vermont stop, located on Exposition Boulevard east of Vermont Avenue. For complete information on all Metro lines and services, including a trip planner, we recommend students visit the Metro website at www.metro.net. Finally, while Carrie does mention Zipcar, she neglects to mention the many other alternative transportation options available to students. Wheelz is a new company that uses students’ personal vehicles, enabling Trojans to rent their vehicles to other Trojans. Zimride is a well-established rideshare program that allows members of the USC community to offer or accept rides from fellow Trojans going their way. Finally, Enterprise Rent-A-Car has an office in Parking Structure X; it is one of the only locations in the city that will rent to 18 year olds.
For more information on any of these partners/programs, or anything transportation-related, students should visit our website at www.usc.edu/parking.

Lifestyle
As a new student in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism I picked up a copy of the campus newspaper.
Expecting to find quality journalistic writing, I was profoundly disappointed after reading the article in the Lifestyle section, “Finding campus romance not stressful or awkward” (Aug. 22). I found the assertions put forth by the author vapid, uninformed and grossly negligent. Though inexcusably clichéd, my problem isn’t with the advice given, but rather the assumptions that inform the author’s opinions. The article asserts that in every Trojan’s mind there lurks a subconscious (and shared) knowledge that “[w]e’re pretty darn good looking.”  Where does the author derive the authority to make that comment? This certainly seems to be her opinion, but what is it exactly that makes her believe the rest of the student body shares this narcissism? Is it the fact that the women on campus “… wear make-up to class and dress themselves in the newest and hottest styles”? Or, is it that “[t]hey (girls) get their hair and nails done”?
I can think of nothing more socially demeaning to my female colleagues than the suggestion that they are attractive and/or desirable because they conform to a gender-based stereotype.
The article goes on to suggest that all long-term relationships have no future at USC and that the best solution is to break them off. This delegitimizes the students who are in committed long-term relationships and marriages and domestic partnerships. However, the most profoundly offensive statement is the closing suggestion that Ms. Watson makes, “If you’re the kind of kid that’s into Open Mic Night, then hit up Ground Zero Performance Café. If you want to get involved in the LGBTQ scene, go to the LGBTQ and Ally Welcome Back Barbeque.” I expected that the editorial staff would identify that categorizing sexual orientation and Open Mic performances together necessarily equates one’s innate sexuality to a vocational interest. This is obviously absurd. Moreover, the excessively glib and loose structure of ideas falls short of what I would expect from USC, an institution with an excellent school of journalism, which I am proud to be a part of.

In high school, a misconceived picture of college is painted: a utopia that is not only free of parental supervision, but one where students can also explore their interests by taking whatever classes they want.
Lener Jimenez | Daily Trojan
I transferred to USC my junior year, but at neither at NYU nor USC did I ever feel like I had academic freedom. Nor did I feel like I was presented with options that diverged from the beaten path and would teach me something worthwhile in a truly interesting way.
The search for such a class this semester highlighted a void at USC, a critical lack of classes that go beyond the norm of what is required of a university and its students. USC needs more classes that experiment with the untraditional, that push boundaries and force interaction with people and exploration of places outside the classroom.
It wasn’t until this semester — my last — that my schedule and number of credits even allowed me to look for such a class. This search, which spanned across departments from creative writing to political science, was wholly disappointing.
Many courses seemed stale and repetitive. Syllabi from past semesters looked like they were all produced from one master syllabus: reading assignments, a couple four- to six-page papers, one midterm, one final — nothing more, nothing less.
I eventually enrolled in “Sound Clash: Popular Music and American Culture” (COMM 307), based on a love of music and a recommendation that Professor Josh Kun is an exceptional professor.
After one day of class, I found out what college classes should really be like.
They should be engaging and comfortable so that students actively want to participate. They should, as much as is relevant and possible, relate to what students care about — contemporary issues, people, music and events (Kun opened class by reading the lyrics to Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me Maybe,” a song I know everyone cares immensely about.)
They should put technology to use in an effective and engaging manner. They should encourage students to take their education outside the classroom (one of Kun’s assignments is a review of a live concert).
It’s also important to note that I’ve never taken a communication class before. I’m not an Annenberg student. Such porous boundaries between USC’s schools are a definite boon that all students should take advantage of during their time here.
There is also a year-old experimental class, taught by Professor Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, called “The Future of California” (MDA 475). The class is broken into sections by various issues facing California, such as the economy, public education, the environment and criminal justice. Each section is then broken into pods of instruction, led not only by Schnur, but also by a guest USC faculty member working in the field, as well as two or more private sector and public sector policy experts. Last semester, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Sheriff Lee Baca visited the class. At the end of the semester, students took a trip to Sacramento to present their final projects to members of the state legislature.
This is not to say that this class and the communication class are the only two of their kind at USC. And admittedly, not every class can resemble them, but more can and should.
We keep hearing about how USC is in an exciting transformational period — from the new campus look and the expansion promised by the Master Plan to rising ratings and a dropping acceptance rate. Why not extend that trend of movement forward to USC’s courses?
The title of Schnur’s class says it all. The future of California, and the rest of the nation, is what USC students represent. It’s time we’re given the academic options that match this momentous role.

I disagree. You can, and most do, explore these things on your own time. The point is to get familiar with subjects you would otherwise don’t get; great ideas, literature, the basics of science, etc.

Faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, ambitious: the five traits of a Trojan. We all learned
them at Orientation, and we all see them waving proudly above our heads on the newly
renovated Trousdale Parkway.
USC’s recent launch of a major bike safety campaign, however, demonstrates a gaping hole in
this fabulous five.
The campaign, known as “We are Considerate. We are USC.,” includes among its proposals the
unofficial addition of a sixth Trojan trait: considerate.
It’s about time. The traits of a Trojan are great traits to have, but they can be used for negative
purposes as well as positive. It takes education and skill to construct a bomb, ambition to develop
a plan to use it, faith and courage to carry that plan out—but the act of blowing up a building
does not make a person great.
Kindness and respect, alongside these traits, are necessary to ensure that we are responsible and
contributing members of our Trojan community.
As administrators recognized, bike safety is a campus issue that could benefit from such
benevolence. It is unfortunate, though, that it took students running each other over with their
bicycles for USC to realize a sixth trait was needed.
The addition of “considerate” under these circumstances seems to be little more than a political
play, to make students more enthusiastic about the new rules and bike lanes they might otherwise
find inconveniencing and unfair.
On the USC Safe Communities website, Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson
and Associate Senior Vice President Charles Lane state that “we aren’t suggesting that we carve
this word into the base of the Tommy Trojan statue.”
The five official traits on the statue, then, still take precedence over being considerate. In reality,
however, consideration for others should be our top priority. We are the Trojan family after all.

The Los Angeles Times completed its countdown of the top 25 college football teams in the country on Tuesday, naming USC as its number one ranked squad entering the 2012 season.
Chris Dufresne, Los Angeles Times columnist and rankings author, cited USC’s ability to persevere through sanctions while stockpiling talented recruiting classes and restructuring the athletic department as the reasons for the school’s success. Dufresne noted that although USC tops the ranking, their slow recovery from NCAA penalties and the team’s lack of depth this season and down the road could hinder their success.
The rest of the top five on the ranking are Alabama, followed by Oregon, LSU and Oklahoma. Two other Pac-12 teams were ranked in the top 25: No. 22 Utah and No. 18 Stanford. Utah is unranked in both the AP and USA Today Coaches’ polls while Stanford sits at No. 21 and No. 18 respectively.
The LA Times is not the only news outlet to anoint the Trojans as preseason favorites to play in the BCS National Championship Game. The first AP poll also features USC atop their leaderboard with 25 first place votes. The Trojans enter the season ranked third in the USA Today Coaches’ poll, sitting behind Alabama and LSU. Those results, however, were collected before the dismissal of LSU star cornerback and punt/kick returner Tyrann Mathieu.
