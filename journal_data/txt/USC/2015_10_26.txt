Fair trade · Shawn Ren, assistant director of PSA, gave students an overview of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Monday. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The Political Student Assembly and Undergraduate Student Government Program Board hosted a discussion and a debate about the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Monday night.
In June, a Trade Promotion Authority bill was passed that would allow Congress to conduct a fast-track vote on any trade legislation, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
“It allows the president to force Congress to vote on a [trade] bill with limited debate time and no amendments, so they can’t filibuster and take forever to vote on it,” said Shawn Ren, assistant director of PSA, who led the discussion.
This partnership will essentially open up trade among 12 different countries, which includes Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, United States, Vietnam, Chile, Brunei, Singapore and New Zealand.
“Each of these countries will vote in their own legislatures to ratify this partnership by 2016,” Ren said. “The official goal was to enhance trade and investment among the TPP partner countries to promote innovation, economic growth and development and to support the retention and creation of new jobs.”
There are two objectives that this partnership hopes to accomplish.
“One [objective] is to lower tariffs across all TPP countries so that there is increased trade between those countries and two is to establish something called an Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanism,” Ren said.  “This mechanism will allow foreign investors to sue a country if that country passes a law that violates the trade agreement.”
TPP will regulate a vast variety of goods and services that will be traded across different nations.
“If it passes, it will regulate everything from the automotive industry, to IP law and to sanitary standards of food,” Ren said. “That’s how big it is. It is going to affect everything.”
Many support the bill, arguing that it will allow unencumbered, free trade among nations and create many jobs.
The Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanism has come under criticism by both Republicans and Democrats due to its complexity and the fact that international lawyers will arbitrate investment conflicts without the use of the respective country’s judicial system. Ren showed a video in which Sen. Elizabeth Warren attacked the bill because of this provision.
“The name may sound mild, but don’t be fooled. Agreeing to ISDS in this enormous new treaty would tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big, multinational corporations,” Warren said in the video. “Worse, it undermines U.S. sovereignty.”
This provision of the partnership will give lawyers the power to dictate American law without actually stepping foot in an American court.
“It forces the U.S. to change their laws because they do not want to get fined [by these international lawyers],” Ren said. “In some ways, other third parties are affecting the U.S. law, which a lot of people do not like.”
Ren also showed a video of Sen. Bernard Sanders’s opinion regarding the TPP, which centered around the loss of American jobs and the power of corporations.
“If you are a big corporation, why are you going to pay an American worker $15 or $20 an hour and provide decent benefits and obey environmental laws, when you could shut down here, go to China, pay people very low wages and bring your products back in America,” Sanders said. “The TPP is a new easy way for corporations to shut down in America and to send jobs abroad.”
Following the brief overview of the partnership given by Ren, the floor was opened up for discussion among the students in attendance.
The main debates were whether or not the TPP should be implemented, whether corporations should pay outsourced labor at wages that can many times be less than the equivalent of one dollar and the necessity of industrial development for developing nations and the negative consequences associated with such.
“I’m definitely for the TPP primarily because I think that a lot of economists agree that when you have more free trade countries tend to be more peaceful,” said Jonathan Gunn, a junior majoring in economics and philosophy. “The TPP will be a force of prosperity not only for the United States but also for the pacific region and create better relationships between countries.”
Gunn said students gained insight into this topic following the meeting.
“I think we had a really good discussion despite the fact that not many people are econ majors,” Gunn said. “But I think that people got the gist of what the treaty is about because it is something complicated that is going to affect everyone in this room somehow or other.”
The discussion was one of a weekly series.
“We wanted to combat political apathy on campus and educate the student body about political issues even with kids who don’t know much about politics and don’t take political science classes,” Ren said. “This was kind of a response to that.”

John Pollard, a junior majoring in business administration, has started Trojan Save, an Instagram account devoted to helping Trojans save money around campus and in Los Angeles.
“We go speak with local businesses and work together to make exclusive offers for our users,” Pollard said. “In order to redeem a deal, all you have to do is show the store that you follow our account and liked the image that corresponds to the offer you want.”
Pollard started the account as a way to help students reduce their stress. By worrying less about finance, Pollard said, students can spend more time focusing on their studies and on socializing. The account has gained nearly 500 followers since it began posting last month.
“Our motto is that you should save on the things you need, so you can spend on the things you love,” Pollard said.
Pollard has worked to make Trojan Save a partnership between students and local businesses so that they can support one another. Businesses that offer special savings get more customers and exposure while students have the ability to save more. Trojan Save has offered promotions from Smiles Cafe, La Taquiza Mexican Grill and 23rd Street Cafe.
The growth of Trojan Save has been an exciting journey for Pollard. He often frequents the businesses that Trojan Save has partnered with, observing students utilizing the businesses’ promotions. Pollard said it’s the most exciting when he sees a student redeem one of the Trojan Save deals.
“It’s really rewarding to see the interaction between student and store and know we’re a part of that relationship benefitting both sides,”  Pollard said.
Beyond seeing Trojan Save in action, Pollard said the team appreciates every new follower, whether or not he knows the follower personally.
“It’s also really funny when I see someone I know start following the account, because I know for some reason Trojan Save crossed their mind and they decided to search us and follow,” Pollard said.
Much of the work for Trojan Save is in creating partnerships with businesses to get deals for students. Pollard said he received a positive response when he first approached business owners with his idea.
“The business owner said, ‘I can’t believe you’re doing this for free,’” he said. “They have enough work to do between running their stores, talking to vendors and so on, so it’s a relief [for them] when we help spread awareness of their message. I thought it would help students from the start but was surprised to find that we were adding a lot of value and support to these businesses as well.”
Pollard said Trojan Save utilizes Instagram to create a unique relationship between businesses and students.
“I’ve found that a lot of businesses are actively seeking out ways to reach students on their phones, and we allow them to post with relevant photos over the Instagram [account],” Pollard said.
The most crucial aspect of the business partnerships that Trojan Save creates is ensuring that they remain personal.
“It allows us to work together to figure out what works best for businesses and students alike,” he said.
Spreading awareness to both students and businesses has been the main objective of Trojan Save.
“In order to spread awareness of our account to students, we’ve made fliers and handed out free coffee at Smiles Cafe,” Pollard said. “It is kind of a chicken and egg problem because we need more users to attract more businesses, and it is important to make sure that we can keep the promotions fresh so students follow us.”
Trojan Save has a couple new plans in store as they continue to grow. Pollard hopes to expand the number of business partners to deliver a better product to students.
“We plan on bringing in a broader range of local restaurants and services so that we bring the best experience possible to our users,” Pollard said. “We’re hoping to get really creative with the promotions we offer as we grow, and hope to have something relevant for most parts of your day, everything from your morning coffee to tickets for a game at the Staples Center.”

Can’t stop Cam · Freshman linebacker Cameron Smith intercepted Utah quarterback Travis Wilson three times in USC’s 42-24 win against Utah. He is the first Trojan since 1991 to have three interceptions in one game. – Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
Freshman Cameron Smith is coming out of Saturday’s victory against No. 3 Utah with two wins.  The linebacker from Granite Bay, California, was named Pac-12 defensive player of the week after picking off Utah quarterback Travis Wilson three times, taking one back for a touchdown.
His three interceptions against the Utes were the most of any USC player in a single game since Jason Oliver accomplished the same feat in 1991 against Penn State. He also notched nine tackles in the game to lead the team.
“I kept feeling the people behind me and trying to pick up the routes as quickly as possible,” Smith said. “I got lucky a couple times, and the ball ended up in my lap.”
Though he is a true freshman, his talent has helped him break into the starting defensive rotation and make an immediate impact. Smith currently leads the team with 62 tackles for the season, and currently ranks second nationally amongst all true freshmen in the same category.
“[Smith] is one of the more football instinctive kids that we have on our team,” said interim head coach Clay Helton. “It was 14-7, and we needed a spark. He gave that to us.”
Smith enrolled at USC last spring after graduating from Granite Bay High School a semester early. He is majoring in communication and maintains a 3.43 GPA.
He is using that intelligence on the field with a talented defense that has struggled at times — especially stopping the run. Before playing against Utah, the defense was giving up 181.5 rushing yards in its last four games.
Smith credited the more physical week of practice, which helped the Trojans hold Utah to 99 rushing yards. The Utes came into the Coliseum averaging 192.5 yards on the ground per game.  He feels that the team needs to get more physical as the season progresses in order to end the season positively.
When pressed further about his interceptions, an exasperated Smith just smiled.
“Enough with the picks,” Smith said. “I’m just really happy that our team played awesome.”

Can’t beat Bricio · Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week for the fifth time this season. – Can’t beat Bricio · Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week for the fifth time this season.
After leading the No. 1-ranked USC women’s volleyball team to a pair of wins against Oregon State (3-1) and No. 25 Oregon (3-0) over the weekend, senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio was named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week for her play during  Oct. 19-25 on Monday.
This is the Guadalajara, Mexico, native’s eighth career weekly honor as Offensive Player of the Week and her fifth time in just nine weeks of play this season. Bricio joins Logan Tom (Stanford, 2001) and Karsta Lowe (UCLA, 2014) as the only players in Pac-12 history to ever achieve this feat. Her eighth career award also ties her with Natalie Williams (UCLA) for third-most awards all-time in conference history.
Bricio helped keep the Women of Troy perfect on the season at 22-0 (10-0 Pac-12) after compiling 38 kills (5.43 kps), 23 digs (3.29) and six service aces (0.86) against the Oregon schools. The nation’s leading point scorer per set and server averaged a whopping 6.71 points per set over the weekend and upped her total number of aces to 58 on the season.
On Friday evening, Bricio had a match-high 23 kills and recorded 15 digs to account for her 10th double-double of the season, while also adding a pair of service aces and three blocks to finish with 27.0 points against the Beavers. Two days later, Bricio led USC to a sweep over the No. 25-ranked Ducks, recording an impressive nine kills on 10 swings in the first set alone before finishing with 15 kills on the day. She also added four more service aces to mark the 38th time in her career that she has had a match with three or more aces.
The two-time All-American moved up USC’s record books for career kills over the weekend as well. Bricio surpassed former USC great and Olympic silver medalist Jennifer Kessy (1995-98, 1,799 kills) for No. 2 all-time with her third kill against Oregon. Now sitting at 1,812 career kills, Bricio needs just 106 more to surpass the program’s current leader and former AVCA National Player of the Year, Alex Jupiter (2008-11, 1,918 kills).
USC remains the last undefeated team in the country and has accounted for their fourth-best start in program history at 22-0. The Women of Troy will now take that perfect record up to the state of Washington this weekend, as they face the No. 5-ranked Washington Huskies (18-2, 8-2) in Seattle on Friday at 8 p.m. before traveling to the Palouse to face Washington State (14-8, 3-7) Sunday at 12:30 p.m.

Leader of the Pac · Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, the Pac-12’s leading receiver, had eight catches for 143 yards against Utah. – Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
USC is the most frustrating football team in the country. Saturday’s dominant win against Utah further reinforced that notion. A 42-24 blowout over the No. 3 team in the country shows just how good the Trojans are but is also a painful reminder of what could have been.
USC left everything out on the field on Saturday, and everyone played to his potential. This was a huge contrast to the last time the Trojans were in the Coliseum when they suffered a loss to unranked Washington.
These two games best represent the Trojans and why they’re a 4-3 team instead of the 7-0 or 6-1 team they’re capable of being. There seems to be no in-between for USC. Either everybody struggles and commits a handful of mistakes, or the team as a whole plays each position flawlessly and is capable of beating nearly any team in the country.
Against Washington, senior quarterback Cody Kessler, who is typically poised and controlled, threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. The blame can’t be placed entirely on Kessler, however, as all seven of his receivers, including Pac-12 leader sophomore JuJu Smith-Schuster, combined for a total of only 156 yards.
The run game seemed to be the only thing that Washington couldn’t stop, but the stalled offense reached all the way up to the coaches, as the play-calling kept revolving around passing, despite the fact that Kessler had been picked off multiple times, and the rushing game looked unstoppable.
Against Utah, it seemed the Trojans could do no wrong. Kessler threw for a touchdown and even kept the ball on a fourth down to dive into the end zone. Smith-Schuster had a phenomenal game, tallying 143 yards and a touchdown, not to mention a stiff arm that electrified the Coliseum as he picked up more yards after the catch.
The defense looked strong through all four quarters, something it has struggled to do this season. Freshman linebacker Cam Smith picked off Utah quarterback Travis Wilson three times, the most interceptions by a USC player since 1991. From the first score of the game, there was nothing the No. 3 Utes could do to stop the Trojans.
In the losses to Stanford and Notre Dame, the Trojans were certainly outplayed. The Cardinal and the Irish were the better teams that night. I don’t think Stanford or even Notre Dame has more talent than USC, however. I think you’d be hard pressed to find a roster with more talent than USC’s.
So if the problem is not a shortage of talent, it has to be tied back to leadership. The only thing standing between USC and a national title is a solid head coach.
Interim head coach Clay Helton has obviously revitalized the Trojans after a sluggish start to the season under former head coach Steve Sarkisian and has said he hopes to be the next head coach at USC. However, Athletic Director Pat Haden’s job is likely riding on the next coaching hire, and Helton might not be a big enough name to satisfy Haden’s critics. Helton would likely have to win out in dramatic style to earn the job.
Kyle Whittingham, Mark Dantonio and Kevin Sumlin are all names that keep coming up, but whoever Haden gives the reins to is the only thing stopping USC from winning a national title.

“What Could Have Been.” Coach Steve Sarkisian might have previously had a wealth of all the coaching talent necessary for first-class USC teams. But he went through a miserable divorce and had alcoholism problems. Which of those came first is irrelevant, but he was clearly unable to practice all the leadership, management, coaching and other skills he needed for best use of the talented Trojan football players. 
A lot of things can derail an outstanding team. Consider the wonderfully talented Reggie Bush, who let us all down by engaging an agent, an act he surely knew was unethical and wrong. He derailed USC Trojan excellence for years. Injuries often destroy the chances of superior teams. As for our sad coach Sarkisian, it was just one of those tragic failures that have dogged our team’s ability to excel fully. Maybe with this latest change, we will be on track for years of great teams. I hope so.
The fact remains that Steve Sarisian was a useless coach, and so was Lane Kiffin.  Compare them to Pete Carroll in coaching quality and performance levels besides track records, and they were both close to nothing.
Varadarajan, You are, of course, absolutely correct. Among USC coaches, only John McKay was at the level of Coach Carroll. But Kiffin and Sarkesian were apparently suitable as assistants, because it was Pete Carroll who hired them as his assistants. Obviously, they proved themselves unsuitable as head coaches at USC. I read that Pete Carroll may have recommended Kiffin and then Sarkisian for his old job, but that may not be true.

At 4:15 a.m, the cars roll in, the squad jumps in and the day begins for the Ice Girls, a spirit squad for the USC Ice Hockey team.
The Ice Girls were founded during the 2010-2011 hockey season by members of the University’s figure skating club who wanted to combine their passion for figure skating with the sport they could cheer for — hockey.
“If you take the LA Kings Ice Crew and then the Song Girls and make them into one [that’s us,]” said co-president of the Ice Girls, Devon Bowman.
The Ice Girls serve as the spirit crew for all home hockey games.  The team energizes and interacts with fans at the game.  Though they don’t lead the crowd in any cheers, the girls help maintain crowd enthusiasm throughout the game.
The girls also perform in between periods during the games.  The team has two routines and is currently working on a third to add to their repertoire.
The Ice Girls have been managed from their start by coach and former USC student Michelle Hanabusa.  Hanabusa is responsible for choreographing all of the game routines for the girls.
In addition to the performances, the team also “sweeps” the ice, a service to the teams playing in which, during a stoppage of play in the period, the girls shovel loose ice and remove it from the rink.
“Our main goal is to help figure skaters continue their figure skating training in college and then also to support the boys on the team,” Bowman said.
The Ice Girls practice twice a week, once on the ice and once off the ice.  Their off-ice practice consists of practicing their choreography and dance routines.
Then, on Thursday morning, the girls travel to The Rinks Anaheim Ice in Anaheim for their 5 a.m. on-ice practice.
“We’re all together at 4 a.m, and you become close and really learn a lot about the other girls on the team,” Bowman said.  “It’s so early, but it’s so fun.”
Bowman said one of her favorite things about Ice Girls is the breakfast burrito stops the girls frequently make on their way back to school in the mornings.
In addition to the hockey games, the Ice Girls have another major commitment: the holiday show they put on in the L.A. Live outdoor rink every December.  This provides the girls with an opportunity to perform under a different premise than their usual game routine.
The team also develops a special holiday routine for the show.
Girls have the opportunity to participate in duets or solo performances that are geared more toward their figure skating background, which is often missing from the game atmosphere.
While skating experience is not required, most of the girls on the team have extensive figure skating backgrounds, and many have competed at the national and international level.
This year, the team added a competition aspect to the program as a USC recreational sport. The Ice Girls qualify as a fourth tier group in their first year as a rec sport and do not receive any funding, but hope to move up to tier three next year.
For their competition, the squad will be competing in the Pacific Coast regional section.  There are normally three competitions the team would need to compete in to qualify for the next level of competition, but for monetary reasons the team will only be participating in one competition in late January.
“As Ice Girls has evolved, we have become more figure skating-based,” Bowman said.  “But it’s not just about figure skating ability. It’s also about personality, tenaciousness and love for hockey.”
The Ice Girls bring together girls from all backgrounds and majors at USC to join together in something that they are all passionate about.
“It’s given me the opportunity to pursue something that I love to do at a university that I love,” Bowman said.
Not only do the girls enjoy the family they have discovered among themselves, they enjoy rooting the hockey team on for who they are both on and off the ice.
“We’re all pretty close. The hockey guys are all super outgoing and fun to be around so we try to do events with them,” Bowman said.  “We do ice cream socials with them and broomball.  It’s definitely a family.”
The Ice Girls will be in action for their holiday show on Sunday, Dec. 6, and will be cheering for the hockey team through the end of their season in late January.

In high school, and much of my first year of college, I shied away from any belief or position that remotely referenced that dreaded f-word: feminism. I felt it was too intense, too polarizing. I had a very skewed vision of what it actually meant (read: equality for all) and also thought that just because I shaved my legs and wanted a guy to pick up the check once in a while, it meant that I definitely wasn’t a feminist. Of course, my views have changed radically since I finally caught up with reality — and a couple of undergraduate courses got a hold of me — and I realized what an important word it truly is. Still, I felt unversed — and still do — in many aspects of gender studies, activism and equality. And so, as a way to educate myself, I took up the task of writing this column.
All this leads to the discussion of Jennifer Lawrence’s recent essay published in Lena Dunham’s newly released women-heralding Lenny newsletter. In the article, Lawrence makes claims about herself as a woman and attempts to challenge the gender wage gap between her and her male counterparts. This topic was first introduced during the Sony hack late last year, where it was revealed that Lawrence made 2 percent less than her male co-stars in David O. Russell’s American Hustle. The disparity might initially sound like very little but actually isn’t when the money we’re talking about is in within the seven-figure mark. Initially, Lawrence remained mum on the issue — as she has in the past about many issues regarding inequality and women in Hollywood. That is, until Lenny.
Her article, “Why Do I Make Less Than My Male Co-Stars?” became a headliner in only the third issue of Lenny ever published, but unfortunately read very informal in tone. She mentions writing on her couch and being too lazy to find a calculator in the other room. She swears with abandon and claims that she was initially excited about writing for Dunham because of the possibilities of what she “could complain about.” She then goes on to mention the infamous Sony hack and states that while she initially dismissed the trouble it caused her, she eventually realized it was an important topic to discuss. Thus, her article was born.
She goes on to state that part of her closed the deal for American Hustle in order to be well-liked and to not come off as “difficult.” She later references a recent event in which she stated an opinion to a male colleague who responded as if she was yelling at him. After all this, she states that she’s through with caring whether she will be gauged a “brat” by her male co-workers.
However, throughout the article, she also said that maybe her fear of being perceived as “difficult” or “spoiled” had nothing to do with her gender and perhaps was “a young-person thing” or a “personality thing.”
Though I’m thankful that Lawrence has finally entered into the conversation, I wish she had taken a stronger stance on her position. As a woman who will soon be making $20 million for her role in an upcoming science fiction romance, Lawrence makes it clear that earning equal pay is attainable. With that type of influence and position, she could do far more than simply adding to a dialogue. She could truly help the greater female population make leaps and bounds over the systematic hurdles we are endlessly faced with in the industry every day.
I almost wonder if her lack of any true conclusion has less to do with her fear of being incorrect, and more to do with her media-bolstered espousal of the characterization of the “cool girl.” Though she states she is “over trying to find the ‘adorable’ way to state my opinion and still be likable” she still manages to do so by going back on the very words she’s postulating and finally clarifying that everything she’s saying may have nothing to do with being a woman, and may be hard to appreciate because her story is “unrelatable.” She also stated that she hopes to “fingers crossed, not piss anyone off.” It’s clear that Jennifer Lawrence believes she can’t be an outspoken feminist because that would make her appear difficult and not so cool. She might lose some of her cinematic luster, and fans will potentially reject her.
I know this statement may inspire many of you to picket with words like “Leave J-Law alone!” in some sort of solidarity with her “effortlessness” and “charm.” But I’m only saying this coming from a girl who used to shy entirely away from the word “feminism” but now holds herself partially responsible for propagating it (at least in this small circle). I would’ve preferred a little more of a rigid position — something that could tell me Lawrence truly believes in what she’s saying and wants to make sure that everyone hears. Not just because Lena Dunham asked her to write a couple dozen words down for an email.

What I am learning late in life is the importance of small steps, making small moves. I think that gifts should be appreciated, and pulling back is a smart thing to do, when ground is taken. Every man and woman must play the same game. This “man’s world” would fall to pieces without women, and bright men know this. In twenty years, women will be the majority of CEOs … At only twenty-five, Jennifer joins the likes of Taylor Swift as a powerful business person, as well as a talented artist.

With Halloween around the corner, the best way to get festive is to get scared. Though theaters are chock-full of horror films, another surefire strategy to find thrills is to go to haunted houses. Sprawled across Los Angeles, haunted experiences range from big-budget theme park attractions to historical sites. Before the spirit diminishes and it becomes Thanksgiving season, go to these attractions for a range of frightening experiences offered in the city.
Halloween Horror Nights
The Walking Dead has one of the most devoted fandoms, and Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights allows the show’s enthusiasts to experience a zombie takeover. Thrill seekers can attempt to escape from the walkers or they can check out the other themed sites. This year, Crimson Peak, dark fantasy director Guillermo del Toro’s latest film, also makes an appearance at the park in the form of a maze. On top of that, guests can also journey through the demonic world of Insidious or try to outrun Halloween’s Michael Myers. Ultimately, with this many choices, the approximately $75 ticket price is worth it.
Ward 13
Now, fans of the horror genre can combine their passion with giving back to the community. Patrons of South Pasadena’s Ward 13, otherwise known Raymond Hill Sanitarium, can take a 15-minute tour of the site and view the harrowing experiments that supposedly once took place there. In reality, Ward 13 is just an old school building, and all proceeds go to South Pasadena Educational Foundation.
Dark Harbor
This haunted attraction, trapped by the confines of the Long Beach waters, takes place on a huge ship, the Queen Mary. When the Queen Mary was built in the the 1930s, it was a sight of opulence. At one point, the ship was the premier luxury cruise liner, carrying celebrities such as Clark Gable and Bob Hope. Though the surge of airplanes caused the Queen Mary to shut down, legends still haunt it. Over the years, there have been 49 reported deaths and hundreds of reports on its paranormal activity. Now open for events and tours only, the chilling backstory adds to the experience, complete with mazes and monsters. Time Out Los Angeles advises people to get to the boat before 8 p.m., when guests can enjoy a $20 happy hour discount.
Stay on Main (Formerly Cecil Hotel)
Right at the heart of downtown Los Angeles lies the inspiration behind one of the scariest television shows, American Horror Story: Hotel. Stay on Main, formerly known as the Cecil Hotel, has been a host to many scary instances in the past. Over the nearly 100 years the hotel has occupied Main Street, two serial killers have made the building their main residence. Additionally, murdered guests have been reported to lurk the hallways. The hotel isn’t open to the public, but Esotouric’s “Hotel Horrors & Main Street Vice” offers tours to those curious of the city’s dark past.

It’s been two years since their last album, I Love You, but The Neighbourhood is finally back at it again. If the three preview songs released from their latest album, Wiped Out!, are anything to go off, the group is further finding a voice that sets them apart from the rest, while simultaneously staying true to their dark tone from their previous album. Wiped Out! is set to be released on Oct. 30.
One of the singles, “Prey,” is a catchy but somber song about two people who don’t connect as well as they should, much to the dismay of lead singer Jesse Rutherford. Lyrics such as, “So I’ll probably take you aside / And tell you what’s on my mind / But you, you’ll just keep it inside” paint a realistic picture of a relationship that’s lost its spark. It also illustrates the pains of a person who is attempting to save a broken relationship that the other person has no intention of fixing. This is reflected musically in the song by switching between a simple guitar and drum pattern and a looming bass with eerie echoes from the plucking of a guitar. Rutherford is trying to stay positive and solve the problem, but whoever he’s singing to is distant and already checked out of what the two had previously shared. All that remains are distant memories.
Their other single, “The Beach,” is a spiritual successor to “Prey,” as the song is the regretful acceptance of the death of a relationship. The song is laced with references to self-blame and, in some cases, suicidal thoughts. Rutherford’s voice trudges through a thick fog, heavily reverberated synths, plucked notes from a crisp guitar and deep bass. This is all kept together by the harsh smacking of drumsticks and snares. His weariness is a constant throughout the song, only offset by his softened screams as he approaches an undesirable truth as the song goes on. The only moments of clarity come from the lyrics, “I think I could see the beach / Just don’t look underneath us,” as Rutherford knows that his expectations of the relationship couldn’t save it from the real problems that were lying beneath it, and he is forced to acknowledge that his paradise is nothing more than an over-idealistic and unattainable dream.
The final song, “R.I.P. 2 My Youth,” has Rutherford singing about a number of things, most notably the death of his innocence. Constant references to being a sinner, the feeling of uncertainty and death are constants in the song. Rutherford feels as if going through the motions of everyday life just aren’t worth it, and he’d rather be dead than suffer in life. “Tell my sister don’t cry and don’t be sad / I’m in paradise with Dad” are a few lyrics among many that express Rutherford’s thoughts of wanting to find a release from the hardships of life through death. The song sounds like the mourning process during a funeral; church organs and booming bass kicks from the drums are honoring the mortal words of the recently deceased Rutherford in the song.
If these three preview tracks are any reflection of what the full album will sound like, The Neighbourhood will continue with their haunting sound and even push the envelope a bit further. It’s certainly not uplifting, but it’s sentimental in its own haunting way. Hopefully, Wiped Out! will avoid the infamous sophomore slump for the group and be the dark paradise that fans are looking for.

Acclaimed playwright Robert Schenkkan stands out as one of the modern masters of the stage. With his Pulitzer Prize-winning The Kentucky Cycle and his Tony Award-winning All The Way, Schenkkan demonstrates his acumen in capturing the vastly complex human spirit. In a phone interview with the Daily Trojan, Schenkkan revealed his creative process ahead of an appearance in which he will speak about his prolific career as part of the Vision and Voices series at Town and Gown on Wednesday.
Schenkkan listed playwrights Eugene O’Neill, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller as his formative literary influences for their social and political content. These were the writers Schenkkan grew up reading, but it was Southern literature writer William Faulkner who shaped Schenkkan’s perspective on history.
“[Faulkner said] history is not dead; it’s not even past. History, in other words, is not something separate from us. We are very much burdened by and, better yet, affected by history,” Schenkkan said. “In many ways, we are conscious of our personal history and inguinal history, so I think it becomes very important to understand that. I think it becomes important for my own growth as an artist and as a human to understand the context of the forces within me.”
Schenkkan approached The Kentucky Cycle, his Pulitzer Prize-winning American mythology play about generations of families in the South. with this mindset. Schenkkan said that he infused ideas of the American Dream. Though Schenkkan described that concept, integral to the development of the United States, as rooted in providing a better life for one’s children, he has seen the American Dream slowly dissolve.
“If you look at college students today who graduate with a staggering amount of debt, the kinds of jobs immediately available to them are hardly those that are able to make much of a dent in that debt,” Schenkkan said. “So you put a whole generation and new workers in a terrible position. This is unbearable.”
Behind the ideals of his recent masterpiece, All The Way, a Broadway play about President Lyndon B. Johnson’s presidency, Schenkkan explored the power agenda behind a deeply ambitious man.
“[Johnson] is a fascinating individual, someone who was a political animal. He had no other interests, no other hobbies,” Schenkkan said. “All he cared about was politics. He was a very ambitious man for sure, and one who was not disinclined to do what it took to rise in the ranks.”
Additionally, Schenkkan celebrates Johnson as a progressive, one who oversaw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and truly wanted to make the lives of his citizens better. Unfortunately for Johnson, the events of the Vietnam War blemished his legacy.
“[Johnson was part of] major policy changes that are now firmly embedded in the policies of our country today,” Schenkkan said. “If one can only eliminate Vietnam, then he would be on Mount Rushmore. But of course you can’t. He lied about Vietnam and lied to Congress. He knew as early as 1964 that we weren’t going to win Vietnam.”
But Schenkkan chose to spotlight the moments leading up to the historic passage of the first meaningful civil rights bill since Reconstruction. He saw ripples of the 1964 events in today’s news, almost 50 years later.
“People think, what’s 1964 compared to 2014? We’re so beyond that. Well, are we? You know, we continue to argue about voting rights and civil rights,” Schenkkan said. “We continue to see black men murdered by white men of authority. We continue to see disparity in social equality and opportunity. Johnson was talking about the consequences of white privilege in 1964.”
In addition to the transcendent words of All The Way, actor Bryan Cranston, who played Johnson, created a multifaceted character. Cranston will also play Johnson in the upcoming HBO adaptation of the play.
“I think Bryan is a terrific actor, very talented. He’s a very transformative actor and changes from character to character,” Schenkkan said. “I also think of him as a friend; he’s very funny. He’s a pleasure to work with — smart, involved, often has very good ideas and is a great pleasure to collaborate with.”
With the great amount of productions under his belt, Schenkkan has been able to adeptly choose the optimal medium for his works.
“Some stories feel very cinematic, and they need the expanse that film or television offers you. Some stories feel more theatrical,” Shenkkan said. “There’s a certain physical size as well as immediacy and containment that is really better suited for the stage. It’s really an intuitive thing that I, and all writers, share. Not everyone would agree with how a work is executed. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t transfer, as exemplified in the case of All The Way.”
Ultimately, that intuitive nature requires years of polishing to achieve, but Schenkkan said that aspiring screenwriters and playwrights should not be bogged down by the process. Rather, it’s crucial to just sit down and start writing.
“My only advice is to do it, and not be daunted by the idea of doing it,” Schenkkan said. “It’s very easy to acquire the technical issues of what does a screenplay look like, what does a play look like, but the work is just sitting down and doing it. And USC has wonderful resources, but you don’t have to have a classroom to do that.”

I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Our generation doesn’t get enough credit. A recent Washington Post article claimed that millennials were the most coddled of all generations of college students because we had both helicopter parents and universities that were making the experience too easy.
The article states that online registration, a clear list of prescribed classes needed for graduation and the higher percentage of college students receiving A’s is a sign that students aren’t properly learning how to grapple with the “real world.” The author claims that these new characteristics of the college experience mean that, compared to previous generations, we aren’t as ready to deal with failure by the time we graduate.
But this is faulty logic. Millennials are constantly faced with the prospect of failure. We have just learned how to lessen the blow. We can discern where in life we allow people to step in to help guide us. We won’t just let failure happen when we know we have new resources available to us.
Many define helicopter parents as those who take an excessive interest in the lives of their child, to the point of not allowing their kids to learn to do things for themselves. They are the ones who speak on the phone with their children daily, pay their kids’ credit card bills for them and have a heavy presence on their children’s Facebook pages. Yet helicopter parents, if we even want to call them that, are not giving us a crutch for adulthood.
College students today are learning and living lives completely different from the ones that previous college students have experienced. We need different methods of surviving.
I think it’s difficult for today’s academics to understand the role of a connected parent and concerned university because technology and its use has progressed so much since their four years in undergraduate education. In the past, they leaned on their friends and those immediately around them to provide advice and support when they failed a test, got out of a difficult interview and were asked the perennial question, “What am I doing with my life?” Today, for all of those concerns, I can make a quick phone call to my parents in addition to asking my college roommates.
College students aren’t replacing the troubleshooting process. They’re just expanding it.
Another reason helicopter parents and accommodating universities shouldn’t be attacked is because the post-grad reality millennials step into every spring requires us to have wiser and more experienced voices giving advice.
Failure in college is way more expensive than it was in the past. Since 1978, the cost of higher education has risen 1,120 percent. The ticket price for USC tuition is $49,464 this year. When my mom graduated in 1980, the average tuition for a private institution cost $4,912 a year, according to the National Center for Education statistics.
The percentage increase for college tuition is higher than any other consumer good, according to a 2012 Bloomberg Business article. Not to mention, the job prospects of full-time employment with benefits aren’t as bright as they were before.
It used to be feasible for someone to work their way through school. Now, it’s impossible to think that college students can’t get through school without some form of support from parents, guardians or mentors to help them navigate the experience.
Our parents who went to college have seen the extreme changes in the price for a college education. Parents have great incentive to make the college process as smooth and successful as possible because that will most likely make it as inexpensive as possible for their pocketbooks.
We shouldn’t judge millennials and their parents for reshaping the type of relationships they have in college. The parameters of college are different than they were for previous generations. We millennials have adjusted accordingly.
For many millennials, the distinction between the “real world” and adulthood in college is becoming fuzzier. Parents and those making decisions at universities are living in the real world, so they can help guide us. I think it’s far less wise to turn away their assistance because there’s a group claiming we might be coddled. We should start being smart and recognize that we need extra assistance for the additional pressures that come our way.

Fraternities presumably entail philanthropy, commitment and chivalry, yet it’s becoming clear that these aspects might be merely a thing of the past.
These components supposedly make up the concept of brotherhood, but it’s evident that brotherhood also embodies the objectification of women. On Oct. 15, Rachel Friedman, an undergraduate student at UCSD, posted her conversation with a Sigma Alpha Epsilon pledge who asked her for a bare photo of her breasts.
“He wanted my breasts and to say ‘rush’ and the name of his fraternity,” Friedman told NBC San Diego.
This is just one of the many questionable incidents to have happened within a fraternity this fall. In August, the Sigma Nu chapter at Old Dominion University was put on suspension after members hung banners from their chapter house reading “Freshman daughter drop off” and “Go ahead and drop off mom too.” A Theta-Omega chapter of Sigma Pi at Middle Tennessee State University was also put on suspension for a banner that read “Freshman Girls Info Center.”
Occurrences that promote the degradation of women are always happening; whether it be a request for nude photos, the display of provocative banners, or even frat parties that have overtly sexual and absurd themes (i.e. “CEOs and Office Hoes”). And while these events are publicized, it seems not much action is taken. Sure, a fraternity can get suspended, even expelled from a university, but these punishments don’t stop the ongoing problem. It’ll raise a few eyebrows, but the problem won’t be completely eradicated. It doesn’t stop the sexist nature that underlies the greek community and the derogatory behavior displayed within other chapter houses that almost seems to have become standard.
The fact is, this is an inherent problem. The safety of women does not seem to be a priority. As people become more concerned with having fun, there’s a complete disregard for the well-being of women. It appears as if the voices of many affected by this culture are subdued, and that this issue is normalized, creating a silent acceptance of sexism within the greek community.
“This blatant misogyny and degradation of women has become so commonplace in society that it is now considered acceptable,” said Thasneem Syed, an undergraduate student at UCSD, on Facebook.
Fraternities need to reevaluate what a brotherhood should truly be composed of and what makes young people thrive and feel accepted. Instead, fraternities have been shaped into a misogynistic and denigrating culture toward women. Campus culture is only set back by incidents that promote the oversexualization of women. Being on campus should encourage the well-being and safety of all students; however, when women encounter some form of sexual objectification, especially by fraternity men, it only goes to show that our society is reverting to a history of inequalities and repealing the progress we’ve made. Gender equality and mutual respect appear lost and with it, the dignity of “men” within the brotherhood is lost as well.
It’s not to say that all fraternities nationwide don’t respect women; however, this is addressing a greater issue that lies inside the greek community. If members are influencing new recruits to demean women, it merely exemplifies that sexual assault and lack of consent are a major problem on campuses nationwide. Simply put, if fraternity men think it’s okay to hang a banner stating, “Rowdy and Fun. Hope your baby girl is ready for a good time,” or ask for nude photos of girls, then it may be safe to assume that they’re OK with sexual assault and lack of consent. Found in a survey given by John Foubert of Oklahoma State University and president of the One in Four national campaign, fraternity men are three times more likely than other college men to commit some act of sexual assault. Overall, BestColleges.com reports that, on average, 1 in 5 college students experience sexual assault during their college career. These mishaps among chapter houses only perpetuate the ongoing problem of sexual assault and degradation of women.
Ultimately, there’s a valid reason to believe that fraternities, whether on a nationwide scale or not, encourage inappropriate behavior and interaction with women. The pressure that rests inside a fraternity to hook up with girls by any means seems to be tremendously prevalent. There is an archetype underlying greek culture that evidently objectifies women. Though many men who are a part of a fraternity don’t partake in demeaning behavior toward women, it’s the greek culture that prompts objectifiable actions in the first place. Pledges are exposed to an entitled mentality where women are to be treated like nothing rather than human beings. The only way to prevent these derogatory actions from happening among fraternities is to stop advocating for the sexual objectification of women altogether and to start teaching common sense, respect and consent.
This article is written by a very confused person who hates men.
Wow, this was both incredibly one sided and completely off base. The leap made from offensive comments to not valuing the safety of women doesn’t make sense, not to mention the flaw of painting hundreds of thousands of kids with such a broad brush. Clearly you don’t know what ‘brotherhood’ means to each fraternity, which is fine, just don’t pretend to define it without at least talking to someone who lives it. I recommend you at least get a real, grounded opinion on an issue as important as this so you can actually have a conversation beyond “these people do things we don’t like, all widespread problems that relate must be their fault”.
Thank you for exposing the dirty, (yet somehow controversial?!) side of Greek life. Sexism is taught, not innate. I am all for a brotherhood of educated individuals, but when values and morals are pushed aside for the supreme “honor” of getting laid, that’s subjugating one’s equal. And that’s an abuse of power.

From break ups to make ups and everything in between, “Love U” captures the nuances of college students’ relationships. “Love U” runs in DeeTs on Mondays.  
It was the tail end of my senior year of high school. It was the time when the future felt closer than the present. I was bored with my surroundings and ready to leave.
I’m normally not one for nostalgia. I knew there would be friends I wouldn’t talk with much after graduation and friends I would, but I was open to the change.
Then he showed up — figuratively, of course. He had always been there, but he was always just my friend. He was one of the few constants throughout my high school experience. He was kind and witty and was always the first to assure me it was going to be OK, even when I was sure it wasn’t.
I always knew what we were; we were comfortable. We were friends, and there was never any confusion or blurred lines.
Then came our last week of senior year. I was ready to move on. My classmates were crying in the halls on their last days of finals, hugging each other, telling themselves they would keep in touch. I felt the jitters and the excitement, but I could never quite get to the level of sentimental reminiscence of my peers.
The weekend before the last week, he and I and some friends went to a private beach at 2 a.m., contemplating our future while we lay on our backs, stared at the stars and listened to the waves crash on the shore.
It was pitch black. I couldn’t see anything, but all of a sudden I felt it. He was lying just inches from me. I could hear his steady breathing. I could smell the salt of the sea, the smell of his cologne. And then, in an instant, I didn’t know who he was anymore.
Was he my friend? This didn’t feel like just a friendship.
We went along like this for the last week of senior year. He felt like more than a friend. To me, he was. But what was I to him?
To a generation so obsessed with labels, I didn’t have a label for us. We had been friends for so long, and we were in this death march toward the uncertainty of graduation. We knew it was coming, but we ignored it.
How do I classify something I didn’t understand myself? In an age validated by being Facebook official, I struggled to make my feelings official to myself, let alone him.
He left the day after graduation. He didn’t say goodbye. We ended our fleeting relationship like we started it — by ignoring what it was. Like if we both ignored it or didn’t say it, it wouldn’t exist. We wouldn’t have to confront our changing relationship or cope with the realization that nothing would ever be the same.
For a girl so ready to move on from high school, who felt nothing as early as a week prior, he came in and out of my life like a whirlwind and left me feeling more broken than I ever had.
I thought about him the whole summer though we barely spoke. I wondered if I had misinterpreted him and me. After all, we never gave labels, we never even tried. I tried to rationalize in my head what had happened. We were friends, and then we were more, and now we’re nothing. We were in purgatory, and I was lost.
I left for college in the fall, ready for a new start. A little bit of me still clung onto him. I tried to explain to my new friends at school what he was and struggled. I normally settled on the very millennial phrase “we had a thing.” But what is a “thing?” “Thing” didn’t seem substantive enough. A “thing” couldn’t leave me as broken and empty as this left me. A “thing” couldn’t come into my stable, pragmatic life and throw it off balance.
A “thing” wasn’t valid. We weren’t a mistake. We weren’t a rash decision. We weren’t just a “thing.” At least not to me.
We picked up again over text when I left for school. We talked late into the night ,and again I was confused, but we were at different schools in different cities and we each had our own lives. It was uncomplicated in the most complicated sense.
Then spring break came. For the first time since graduation, we would both be in the same city for a week. I was nearly done with my freshman year at this point, and I no longer felt anything. I wasn’t confused, and I wasn’t disillusioned.
Then he showed up. He wanted to see me, he missed me, he wanted things to be like they used to be. And all of a sudden, I felt tiny. Just like coming home and driving the streets around my house felt all too familiar in a sickening way that reminded me I don’t belong to them anymore, I felt myself slipping back into his convoluted grasp. I was confused. I thought I had moved on, I thought I didn’t care but here I was again, in my childhood bedroom, sitting on my floor and wondering what we were.
That was the problem with him and me. We never were, but we never weren’t. We were friends for a third of my life, and then he was more than a friend, and now he’s nothing. We’re nothing.
We’re nothing because I learned that he and I can’t be anything else. We weren’t good at being friends, we weren’t good at being more. We were in a constant fluctuation between the two, and the oscillations always left me breathless and dizzy.
I miss him. I miss how we were lying on the beach, before everything changed. When our friendship was as constant as the waves kissing the shore.
We never were, we never weren’t. But now I know, we never can be.

Dear Tiffany,
How do you sustain a relationship when both you and your partner are graduating and taking jobs in different cities? Is it time to split?
Before you consider taking on long distance, make sure your relationship has an impressive amount of mutual trust, respect and adoration. A long distance relationship isn’t even worth considering if it isn’t built on a strong foundation. 
Until the time comes to be separated, just enjoy what you’ve got going. Assuming you’re graduating in May,  you still have more than six months to make a decision. At that time, if you are still debating the opportunity cost of staying with him or her, then you should probably end it. Long distance is only a good decision if you really want to be in the relationship and will find your significant other worth the emotional challenges. 
Though obviously not ideal, dating long distance while starting the next chapter of your lives might offer some advantages. You can dedicate most of your time to making new friends, adapting to your new job and living your new life. Through all of these changes, you will have the familiar support of someone who wants to see you succeed.
To sustain your relationship, you should both recognize that it will take lots of maturity, adaptability and an aversion to jealousy. In addition, there also needs to be healthy confidence in yourself, each other and your relationship. Be honest when you ask yourselves if you mutually have what it takes, because few people do.

Well that was refreshing wasn’t it? The Coliseum was rocking and USC showed up on a big stage against a very good Utah team. Clay Helton has this team playing for each other in a way reminiscent of the days of Coach Ed Orgeron. It remains to be seen whether or not USC shuns the idea of Helton as the future head coach in favor of the likes of Justin Fuente of Memphis, Tom Herman of Houston, or John Harbaugh of the Baltimore Ravens. But I do think that things are looking up in the current state. This season can be salvaged with a couple more wins, most importantly against UCLA at the end of the season. USC has a very tough road test against a sneaky Cal Bears team. Troy Talk will be traveling up to the Weekender to get up close and personal and provide you guys with some hard hitting analysis.
Quarterback: B
Running Backs: B+
Wide Receivers: A-
Offensive Line: C+
Defensive Line: B-
Linebackers: A
Secondary: B-
Special Teams: D
Overall: B
Prediction: Cal 38- USC 35
Fight On!
USC will most probably defeat both University of Californias, Berkeley and Los Angeles.  The have correctly got rid of useless and over-paid as well as irresponsible coaches liek Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian.  These coaches were not really competitive at the top level.  The assessment of Troy Rice is very baised.  Not everything can be explained by the super-plays of Cameron Smith and otehr line-backers.  The USC team is under-rated and its former coaches were both over-rated.

Time and time again, musicians have been known to take political stances on issues ranging from civil rights, labor equality and environmental conservation. They’re able to use their popularity as a platform to define political stances and garner support for these issues. In the 21st century, we see that more and more artists are attempting to bring light to political issues they feel are important.  
Neil Young’s 36th album, The Monsanto Years, takes a strong stance on Monsanto and Starbuck’s use of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in their products. Following the June 29 release of his new album, Young launched a website called GoEarth.org this month. It provides information on topics ranging from earth ecology and the future of farming to climate change and social causes. 
The goal of the website is illustrated by the mission statement, “It takes a village to keep the free world rockin’.” There are seven links — “Earth Ecology,” “Future of Farming,” “Energy and Climate,” “The Good Life,” “Ban GMOs,” “freedom and justice” and “News You Can Trust” — that lead the viewer to different pages where they can connect with organizations and services that advance Young’s stance on environmental issues.
Neil Young isn’t the only one who is using his music and fame as a platform to express political views and activism.
Through their work too, Beyoncé is advocating for gender equality, Jessie J for anti-bullying and Desaparecidos for the NSA monitoring large insurance companies and Wall Street.  
They are following in the footsteps of historic artists such as Bob Dylan, Buffalo Springfield and Creedence Clearwater Revival. One standout musician-activist that also comes to mind is Pete Seeger, who was arrested for his opposition of the Vietnam War by the House Un-American committee.
These political issues are gaining increasing support through big-name endorsements and popular music. Because so many look up to these artists and admire their work, it’s relatively easy for them to gain support for any political statement they make, and effectively promote their message.
Though many of these musicians do promote great causes, it’s also quite easy to be fooled into molding our own beliefs to the popularized beliefs of these artists. It is up to us, the listener, to decide for ourselves what we believe is important and worth advocating for. We need to do our own research instead of blindly following the beliefs of popular media. These ideas sound good, but we must also be wary and recognize that there are two sides to every story. 
Don’t drink the Kool-Aid.

Instagram has allowed communication to become visual.  Thanks to the popular app, people’s lives and important events are shared not only through words, but also through engaging snapshots. Today, millions of people use the social network app to remain connected and up-to-date with the world around them, from news to fashion.   
There are numerous fashion blogs and Instagrammers who gain recognition from their followers for their unique and innovative fashion choices. Here are three of my favorite fashion forward Instagram accounts to follow:
SongofStyle
Although she was born and raised in Southern California, Aimee Song documents her daily fashion choices regardless of whether she is residing here in L.A., or the other side of the world. This blogger brings a mix of laidback SoCal styles and cool, contemporary fashions to create a fun mix. With almost 3 million followers, Songofstyle is making her mark in both the fashion and Instagram communities.

ManRepeller
Branding her blog off the idea of “man-hating fashion,” ManRepeller has gained a lot of attention from fashion-lovers within the recent few years. She features fashion choices that women love, but men hate. ManRepeller’s blog is quite the hype due to her innovative and quirky styling, and humorous text. Also check out the woman behind 
ManRepeller, Leandra Medine, on Instagram.  Looking at her pictures will leave you wanting to mix up your wardrobe, and try different combinations you never would have thought of.

Is it possible to make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle sexy?
For a lot of girls, Halloween has just become an excuse to wear revealing clothing. Instead of conforming to the average, basic Halloween costume, let’s start dressing up instead of dressing down. Here are some suggestions to avoid being basic this Halloween. But first, you need to know how to spot a basic Halloween costume.
The Basic Ideas
These were some of the costumes that I found on the Internet:
Sexy Animal
“Sexy” is a term that gets thrown around a lot during Halloween. Animals are not sexy, nor are they an original idea. I don’t think I have ever seen a bunny or cat with cleavage so unless you are going to be anatomically correct, move on from the idea.
Sexy Nurse
The nurses that I know are not allowed to wear lingerie as part of their uniform. The pleather outfits featured on Halloween sites are far too impractical when thinking about a nurse’s daily routine. For the most part, they wear baggy scrubs that make their curves almost impossible to detect.
Sexy Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle
I am not even sure that it is possible to dress up like a sexy Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle — so if you do, this one gets a pass.
Sexy Cop
When I was pulled over for a speeding ticket, I can assure you the cop was not wearing fishnets and a mini skirt.
The Creative Ideas
These are ideas that are sure to be a hit because they were not found on the internet.
Hillary Clinton
Political affiliation aside, this costume is sure to be a success. A pantsuit, short style hair-do or wig and a broach will get the message across.
Pumpkin Spice Latte
If you are feeling left out by not being basic this year, be the beverage that every bunny, nurse, cop and cat will want to enjoy!
A Chipotle burrito
Burritos are always a hot topic around college students. This costume would be hilarious, and the layers would be practical for a cold Halloween night. Make sure to incorporate some green in your costume, because you are worth the extra money for guacamole.
Netflix and chill
Print out the Netflix logo, slap it onto a red t-shirt, carry around an ice cube tray and you’re set to go.

As a fellow college student, I understand how difficult it can be to get into the routine of waking up with enough time to get ready before actually needing to be in class. Too often I find myself reaching for a the nearest top, pair of shorts and sandals and calling it a day, but accessorizing and looking put together doesn’t have to be a challenge. That’s why I’m here to provide you with some tips to make your mornings a little bit less dreadful and a little bit more stylish. 
Two-In-One Sweater
 The key to easy morning dressing is the two-in-one sweater. The two-in-one sweater (a sweater that makes it look like you’re stylishly layering a shirt underneath, even though it’s really part of the sweater) is your best friend when picking two coordinating tops in the morning is just not an option. It solves all of your problems by being just as comfy as a normal sweater, while simultaneously making it look like you’ve got crazy good layering skills. And the best part is it takes less than 30 secs to look flawless before you run out the door.
J. Crew Striped Long-Sleeve T-Shirt With Shirttail Hem $78
 
Ankle Bootie
Oh how I love the ankle bootie. When wearing the right pair, they can feel just as comfortable as your favorite pair of sneakers or flats, while still looking effortlessly chic. An ankle bootie can be paired with a cute fall skirt, dress, or jeans. Not to mention, you still get a very fall-esque look without burning up in the Southern California heat. 
J. Crew Frankie Ankle Boot $228
Sunglasses
 Owning a fashionable but classic pair of sunglasses is essential to pulling off a simple and chic look in the morning. They keep you looking good while you’re riding your bike or walking between class, while shielding your eyes from the harmful sun, putting the fun in functionality.

Zappos Ray-Ban ‘Clubmaster’ 49mm Sunglasses$150
 
Simple Leather Tote
Who doesn’t love a good leather tote bag? It functions just as well as  everyone’s beloved backpack, but it prevents your shoulders from looking strange around your backpack’s shoulder straps, It also makes you look like the trendy college student every high schooler dreams of becoming once they finally get into their university of choice. The leather tote is much more durable than a simple canvas tote, and is also a little bit more upscale.

J. Crew New Uptown Tote$178
 
Stylish Sneakers
 As much as we praise the ankle bootie, sometimes all you want to do is throw on a pair of sneakers and call it a day. Before grabbing the nearest pair of running shoes though, think about investing in a pair of casual sneakers. Jack Purcells, Converse, or a cute colored pair of Supergas are the perfect pick for your stylish sneakers. (No, this does not mean you should wear your “row shoes” to class either. If that’s the case you might as well wear the running shoes.)
Nordstrom Jack Purcell Sneakers $64.95
Colorful Scarf
Once it starts to get colder, wearing a scarf will be a natural inclination, but instead of wearing a simple, black, white, or gray scarf, think about bright colors or patterns. Wearing a bright color will not only help boost your mood on a gloomy day, but you’ll make a strong impression on others, and make them smile as well.
