This year’s college basketball postseason definitely earned its nickname. The “madness” of this year’s competition was in rare company. From the miraculous Cinderella run by No. 15 St. Peter’s into the sweet 16 to No. 1 Baylor and No. 2 Auburn’s early exits, this year’s results busted most brackets open in just the first weekend. Here are some of the best storylines from the Big Dance. 
St. Peter’s 
The most tantalizing and unexpected story this year started when a small commuter school in New Jersey took on one of the most storied college basketball programs in history in Kentucky. I live a half hour away from the Peacock’s Yanitelli Recreational Life Center in Jersey City, and I had never heard of St. Peter’s until they played Kentucky in the first round of this year’s tournament. The nation watched as the huge underdog defeated Kentucky, a popular favorite to win the tournament and a program that outspent St. Peter’s this year by over 16 million dollars. 
The Peacocks went on to face Murray State, a team that featured one of the quickest and most potent offenses in the nation. St. Peter’s handled them comfortably after a 17-point effort by senior forward KC Ndefo. At this point, St. Peter’s had become the third 15-seed in history to reach the Sweet 16, in company with Oral Roberts and Florida Gulf Coast. If St. Peter’s had lost here, it still would have been one of the most historic runs in the history of the tournament. However, the Peacocks continued dancing, beating another Final Four favorite in No. 3 Purdue 67-64. The Peacocks fell to No. 8 North Carolina in the Elite Eight, but not before shocking the basketball world and inspiring thousands. 
Coach K runs into a familiar foe in his final season
Duke’s Head Coach Mike Krzyzewski is the greatest college basketball coach of all time. His 47-year career features 13 ACC championships, five national championships and two Olympic gold medals. While those that hate Duke — in other words, everyone besides Duke fans — tried to diminish his accomplishments at points in his career, his resume speaks for itself. Coach K’s farewell tour was far from underwhelming. No. 2 Duke advanced all the way to the Final Four, with notable wins against No. 3 Texas Tech and No 4. Arkansas. 
In what ended up becoming the final game of his illustrious career, Duke faced North Carolina. Both teams are “blue bloods,” an elite class of college basketball programs, and bitter rivals. Despite the 81-77 defeat at the hands of the Tar Heels, Coach K was a class act until the end. 
“I’ve said my entire career that I wanted my seasons to end where my teams were either crying tears of joy or tears of sorrow. Because then you know they gave everything,” Krzyzewski said after the loss. 
Coach K will be missed and forever immortalized in the annals of college basketball lore.
Brackets busted earlier than usual as favorites drop early
This year, none of the three teams with the highest odds to win the tournament (Gonzaga, Kentucky and Arizona) made it past the Elite Eight, compared to two out of three last year. The unpredictability of this year’s tournament was truly historic. Most years, the March Madness blues begin around late March, when most favorites drop from the dance. This year though, barring unusual selections, only those rooting for top-seeded Villanova and Kansas to win still had a horse in the race by the end of the month. Kentucky’s loss at the hands of No. 15 St. Peter’s was by far the most notable, but was far from the only surprise. No. 11 Michigan, a team I deemed a “massive disappointment” in my February column and that many pundits believe should not have made the tournament, knocked off No. 3 Tennessee. No. 10 Miami, the team that defeated our beloved Trojans in the first round, beat No. 2 Auburn in the round of 32 in a blowout. Despite the absurdity of March Madness this year, it ended on a relatively predictable note. No. 8 seed North Carolina narrowly lost in the championship to No. 1 Kansas, a top five favorite to win the title.
It was a wild ride. On Selection Sunday, 68 teams and their respective fans stood against each other, embarking on a quest to etch their names in history. Now, after all the heartbreak, misfortunate, euphoria and fervor, Kansas stands alone at the summit of the basketball world. Until next year, my friends, 342 days to go.

Two hundred twelve positive coronavirus cases were recorded in the USC community last week, compared to 140 positive cases the week before, according to the University’s coronavirus dashboard. 
“While we are seeing an increase, it’s not an exponential increase,” said Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman at a student media  briefing Tuesday. “We do believe that most of this was related to spring break travel.”
USC Student Health continues to closely track positivity rates and USC community members previously in contact with people who have tested positive, Van Orman said. 
On Monday, Trojan Check validations were no longer required for all campus access points. Student Health made the change to align with Los Angeles County practices, including no longer requiring proof of vaccination for public areas like gyms, restaurants and events.
“Our campus … is over 95% vaccinated and over 86% boosted,” Van Orman said. “We have a community that’s very well protected against this illness”
Student Health plans to individually contact all students, staff and faculty who are eligible to receive their second booster shot, and those who are still in need of their first booster. 
“Despite all of the conversation about vaccines and people still getting infected, the vaccines really do what we want them to do, which is to prevent individuals from suffering the worst consequences of this virus,” Van Orman said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended that adults over 50 receive their second booster shot. Additionally, those who received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as their first dose should receive their second booster. 
Approximately 85% of students and faculty are boosted, and Student Health urges those who aren’t boosted to get their shot. Vaccines are continually proven to prevent severe disease, hospitalization and death, Van Orman said. 
The coronavirus has also directly spread among people living together, influencing the increase in cases. Despite this, Student Health has not seen significant outbreaks. 
Cases in L.A. County also remain very low, Van Orman said. Positive cases have plateaued, with only minimal rises.
Additionally, the aftermath of spring break travel has caused a drastic increase in the percentage of BA.2 coronavirus cases. Before spring break, the percentage was about 25%; however, the variant now makes up close to 90% of USC cases.
Van Orman said BA.2 has not appeared to display any more significant symptoms than other strands, despite its more infectious nature and encourages vaccinations to prevent hospitalization, severe disease and death. 
Student Health encourages any students with symptoms to get tested immediately, including all students who have come in contact with people who have tested positive. Student Health also recommends students wear masks indoors, despite the removal of the mask mandate March 7. 
“[For] most of the cases we’re seeing, people are symptomatic, so that remains the best indicator for someone that they could be infected and they need to get tested,” Van Orman said. 
Quarantines have increased through USC at local hotels. Student Health estimates 100 to 150 students currently in quarantine, compared to less than 50 before spring break. However, the current number of students quarantining is nowhere near the level it was at in January, Van Orman said.
“We hope this was related to travel,” Van Orman said. “We were anticipating an uptick in cases seven to 14 days post-spring break, but we’re watching very closely this week to see if cases start to come back down.”
If cases do not go down, Student Health will start working with the county to see if mask mandates and surveillance testing need to be reinstated. These requirements may not come into effect across campus, but perhaps in specific areas, Van Orman said. 
“What we’re trying to do at USC is prevent the spread so that we can protect our health for both our vulnerable faculty, staff and students, but also to protect the community around us and protect our healthcare system,” Van Orman said.

The Undergraduate Student Government held its final meeting with the 2021-22 cabinet and swore in next year’s elected officers and the 142nd senate Tuesday. 
Hannah Woodworth, USG’s 2022-23 president, was the first to be sworn in and spoke about what she hopes to accomplish in the next year.
“As we transition into a new year, we get to redefine our USG priorities,” said Woodworth, a junior majoring in journalism. “Our first priority must be uplifting student voices. We must strive towards greater coalition building both inside and outside the organization. USG must take on a more active role in our community.” 
Following Woodworth’s speech, Nivea Krishnan, a sophomore majoring in public policy and economics, was sworn in as the vice president, followed by Courtney Azari as chief justice and the 142nd USG senate. 
“Going into this year, we have an immense responsibility but also an opportunity,” Woodworth said. “After witnessing the collective resilience of our community these past two years, I could not be more hopeful about what we can and what we will accomplish in USG this coming year.” 
Outgoing president Alexis Areias also gave the first in-person State of the USG address in two years and said she was “proud of the resiliency” that the USG community displayed in that time. 
“I’m proud to say that we, as an organization, are better off than we were a year ago. In the midst of transition, we are back in person and we are no longer in recovery mode,” Areias said. “We are now in a position to push full force ahead.” 
The USC History Fund, which looks to allocate $10,000 to the University’s history department to “study USC histories that have been forgotten, overlooked, subordinated, or suppressed,” was unanimously approved. 
Additionally, the senate unanimously passed the Resolution in Support of Petition Recognition. The resolution recognizes that student-driven positions serve as the strongest advocacy tool for underrepresented groups on campus and start necessary conversations about overlooked problems on campus. The resolution calls for University administration to implement a framework to acknowledge petitions and provide an email response to petitions that receive at least 1,500 signatures no later than two weeks after the petition meets the necessary qualifying criteria. 
“This resolution would further address those things that aim to encourage student-led activism and advocacy efforts,” said queer and ally student assembly advocacy liaison Rudra Saigal. 
The Military Associated Student Assembly and the Middle Eastern and North African Student Assembly both received unanimous approval to join the programming department as assemblies. 
“We are so blessed to have USG,” said Anthony Khoory, a junior majoring in sociology who has advocated on behalf of MENASA since 2019. “This is to the amazing senators and amazing students … who are sick and tired of the last couple years … You have to stand up for what you believe is right.”
Senator Arie Abija presented some of her accomplishments from the past year, including the Trojan Shop Local campaign, which will encourage students to engage with Black and Indigenous people and people of color-owned businesses, drafting the resolution in support of Ukrainian students and hosting the “Hues of Healing” art therapy for survivors event.
After the inauguration, two new senators, Victor Ye and Alvaro Flores, introduced a new senate Resolution in Support of Extending the Spring 2022 Pass/No Pass Deadline, which expressed USG’s support of a student-launched petition to extend the Pass/No Pass grading option deadline to April 15. The resolution will be voted on at next week’s senate meeting.

During her time spent learning about humans and space, Britt Duffy Adkins, a graduate student studying urban planning, noticed the lack of representation in conversations about the final frontier. She also recognized the simplification of space exploration as a solely “engineering problem” that did not take social, political and cultural implications into account. 
While enrolled in the Space Resources Program at the Colorado School of Mines in 2019, Adkins wanted to create a media company more accessible to previously underrepresented groups in the space industry. In 2020, she started Celestial Citizen, a medium to provide people an opportunity to see themselves in future conversations of space exploration and to “reject the status quo, both here and in the Cosmos.”
“If you look at the way that we’ve done things in space, historically, it’s really been focused around this white male, American-centric narrative, and that’s kind of just the way that things have always been done,” Adkins said. “Missions have always been planned with that bias in mind … Our storytelling about space has always been told through that specific lens.” 
The Celestial Citizen podcast, which first aired in January 2021 and has since produced two seasons of content, is the space media company’s first project. The podcast aims “to provide an opportunity for conversation about how to be a better interplanetary citizen and responsible steward of Earth and the cosmos.” Topics on the show range from space environmentalism and orbital debris to health considerations for the LGBTQIA+ community.
The podcast also brings on different guests, including experts on space, human rights and engineering. One of the show’s guests, Angel Abbud-Madrid, the director for the Center of Space Resources and Space Resources Graduate Program at the Colorado School of Mines,  encouraged Adkins when she came up with the idea for Celestial Citizen. 
“I was quite excited,” Abbud-Madrid said. “It was one of the first interviews, and to be interviewed by a student, it’s always exhilarating, especially [being] interviewed by her because she has very pointed questions … It was a great way to contribute to what my expertise is, and being interviewed by her was quite an honor.”
Marlon Boarnet, professor and chair of the Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis at the Price School of Public Policy, urged Adkins to apply to USC from the Colorado School of Mines. Boarnet said that it is not unusual for graduate students from Price to start their own companies.
“The nature of the company, of course, is very innovative, so I’m thrilled to see it,” Boarnet said. “We’re also proud of [Adkins] … She’s bringing the same kind of initiative and leadership that we really do try to foster among all our students, and so we’re thrilled with her accomplishments.”
Boarnet also described Adkins as a “self-starter.” Their conversations revolved around ideas that she had already thought through, Boarnet said.
“A lot of my advice was to help her think through the analogues of the urban governance problems that we see here on Earth,” Boarnet said. “A whole lot of planning is thinking through the basics of government to democratic representation.”
Price classes guided Adkins and her company, including adjunct professor Katherine Perez’s “Participatory Methods in Planning and Policy” class, which Adkins said allowed her to ideate on potential participation methods for the community, and professor Lisa Schweitzer’s “Seminar in Social Justice and Public Policy” class, which she said encouraged her to think about how she wanted to represent her media group. 
Celestial Citizen also releases content through different media formats, including film, YouTube videos and livestreams. The media company recently debuted “Take Up Space,” a short film that premiered at the Overview Effect Film Festival. The company also launched Continuum, a podcast that covers space news. 
Evan Yee, the head of production for the Celestial Citizen podcast and the producer and director of the Continuum podcast, joined the team when he met Adkins through a connection from another student at USC. He described the workflow as consisting of doing work during the week and the weekends. 
“A lot of people admire [Adkins’] vision and her drive to create something so special and unique,” Yee said. “I really admired the kind of leadership spirit that she has and [am] happy to support and advise where I can and make this a really great working relationship so that we can put out some awesome products.”
From the perspective of a casual space fan, Yee said he believes that looking into space issues can help with examining problems on Earth.
“The narrative of space right now in the mainstream media is the billionaire space race,” Yeehe said. “[The podcast is] about really broadening everyone’s horizons about why this is helpful for everybody, and it’s not just Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos just zooming up there as fast as they can.”
Adkins said that one of the most rewarding parts about creating Celestial Citizen has been shifting the way media covers space exploration. She sees Celestial Citizen as being a counterbalance to the currently “stale narrative” of the media.
“We all receive messages, emails from people that listen to the podcast that will say, ‘I never thought … that I could have been a part of the space industry, or I never thought that this would be something I could do or something I could pursue, but listening to the podcast or seeing your films made me feel like there’s a place for me,’” Adkins said.

I think it’s about time that I turn this column controversial with my scorching takes. So, here goes nothing: People can be funny no matter their gender identity. Searing hot take, I know. Hopefully you didn’t get burned. 
Obviously, I’m messing around. While there are countless internet trolls who continually scream-cry that women aren’t funny — as if seeing women do stand-up is a personal slight — it is undeniable that the world is slowly, but surely, accepting women into the world of comedy. 
Ignoring whatever you thought of their performance, three female comedians hosted the Oscars this year. Personally, I was not a fan of their hosting, and they garnered a lot of negative reviews. But then again, when was the last time we had a good Oscars host? 
Women in comedy write award-winning television shows such as “Insecure” or “A Black Lady Sketch Show,” while their predecessors, such as Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy, continue to enjoy box office success with their newest projects.
However, while women are making great strides in most areas of entertainment, men are just funnier, according to late night television, at least. 
Some late night comedy shows combine comedy and commentary — think John Oliver and Trevor Noah. Women, while less popular than the two men listed, have decidedly broken their way into the subgenre. “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee’’ continues to provide laughs in its seventh season and “The Amber Ruffin Show’’ shocks and awes in just its second season. 
When I talk about late night television, I don’t mean thoughtful political commentary.  I mean late night talk shows: the land of Seth, James and the Jimmys, squared with such creative titles as “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” “The Late Late Show with James Corden,” “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” While the shows have begun to regularly feature political bits, their long-standing appeal lies in creating silly moments with A-list celebrities.
Late night talk shows aren’t the greatest form of media or entertainment by any standards, but how am I supposed to not watch John Mulaney’s “Royal Watch” on “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” or miss out as Seth relives his “Saturday Night Live” glory days with my favorite cast members? Even though James Corden’s 2021 “Cinderella” performance has kept me up at night and made him my personal villain, that doesn’t stop me from watching my favorite artists on “Carpool Karaoke.” And, if Taylor Swift ever decides to make another appearance on “The Tonight Show,” I will be watching the interview the instant it drops on YouTube (I spent a good while trying to think of something I like about Jimmy Kimmel — I’ve got nothing).
All these men have found great success with their shows, programs that have spanned decades by passing the hosting baton from man to man. 
Now, beloved late-night host Conan O’Brien of “Conan’’ has decided to retire from the show, leaving an opening on TBS to create a new-late night talk show. It is not yet announced who the replacement will be, but if TBS wants the show to be even half as successful, they shouldn’t hire a woman. 
That’s been tried once, and the only way to describe it is as a flop. “A Little Late with Lilly Singh” was set to replace “Last Call with Carson Daly” after its 17-year run came to a close in 2019. Singh’s show barely lasted two seasons, and while it received mostly positive reviews from critics, it was torn apart by viewers.
It is safe to say that Lilly Singh is not everyone’s cup of tea — her comedic style has not really evolved since she first got popular on YouTube in the early 2010s. However, are we saying that James Corden’s formulaic “Crosswalk the Musical’’ segment is that much more groundbreaking? The segment, like countless others repeated every week, is purely formulaic: James tricks a celebrity into coming, James takes the musical too seriously, the celebrity is confused by and concerned about James, the musical happens and the celebrity discovers a passion for the crosswalk musical just in time for an ad break. I’m not saying this repetition makes a bad segment — I find myself enjoying it from time to time — but the mediocrity it demonstrates is only ever acceptable for James and the other men of the industry. 
Men on late night shows are held to a much different, and much lower, standard. They can make the same joke countless times, give a fake laugh, deliver lukewarm political takes and still thrive. This even ignores these shows’ histories of problematic bits, like the racist Jimmys. While I adore Seth Meyers, late-night talk shows are a breeding ground for averageness. Singh just couldn’t match the mediocrity of the men in her genre. No woman will be able to because women in comedy, especially women of color like Lilly Singh, are not allowed to be mediocre.

In a world where movies easily run for more than two hours, finding good films with less time-consuming running times is a demanding job, especially with the plethora of choices afforded by a myriad of streaming platforms. Here are some movies that you can watch via your USC HBO Max subscription between study sessions, guilt-free.
“KIMI” (2022), 89 minutes
From director Steven Soderbergh, “KIMI” follows Angela Childs (Zoë Kravitz), an agoraphobic IT worker in Seattle, as she comes across evidence that puts her into a dangerous situation. In under 90 minutes, Soderbergh makes “KIMI” a tech thriller that everyone can easily understand, with familiar elements such as voice assistants and a pandemic setting. Keep in mind how a home, free of the public and a sanctuary of safety — especially during a pandemic — comes to strip its owner of their privacy. Watch the scenes that seem unimportant carefully — you will enjoy how they intertwine at the end, a specialty of Soderbergh’s films.
“What We Do In the Shadows” (2014),
86 minutes 
From Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement, “What We Do In the Shadows” is a mockumentary-style comedy about four vampires who live in New Zealand as they adjust to human society. Both absurd and realistic, “What We Do In the Shadows” does an excellent job of embodying supernatural characters in the real world through the lens of mockumentary storytelling. But what makes “What We Do In the Shadows” a great movie is its comedy. Co-directors Waititi and Clement execute this well by planting comedic elements and using them later in the movie, so be on the lookout.
“Lady Bird” (2017),
94 minutes
In just under 95 minutes, Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird” portrays a year in the life of Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) as she navigates the discord and conflicts that arise from friendship, romance, family and college admission in her last year of high school. While this may sound like a generic coming-of-age movie, Gerwig’s beautiful and subtly comedic portrayal of the chaotic life of a teenager makes the movie stand out from its genre. While watching the film, try to think about being considerate of what and who will allow you to love better. It will make the last couple of scenes in the movie more memorable, relatable and rewarding.
“Nobody” (2021),
92 minutes
If you liked “John Wick” by Chad Stahelski, then you will love Ilya Naishuller’s “Nobody.” The film follows Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk), a retired assassin who lives a tedious and dangerous life kept away from his family. But everything changes when a pair of burglars steal his daughter’s kitty cat bracelet, spurring him back into action. In 92 minutes, “Nobody” tells a story about a man who cannot help himself to maintain a normal life and go back to doing what he does best: killing bad guys. The movie is full of action, and the final throwdown shows how Odenkirk nails his role as a retired killer.
“Mogul Mowgli” (2020),
89 minutes
Bassam Tariq’s “Mogul Mowgli” tells the story of British Pakistani rapper Zed (Riz Ahmed), who struggles with an autoimmune disease that stalls his first big tour. While recovering from his unexpected illness, Zed explores his identity by interacting with his family and reliving his past, which helps him realize that he doesn’t have to hold himself to the extreme ends of his life. He isn’t a world-class rapper nor a complete failure but learns that he can stand in the middle, like Toba Tek Singh, a small town between India and Pakistan in the short story of the same name by Saadat Hasan Manto, as well as the title of a song that Zed produces.
While these movies are relatively short, be wary to not watch them all at once, a procrastination move which will quickly take seven hours of your day.

After months of rummaging through Goodwill and designing looks for student models, the ART/EMIS fashion show team are making the finishing touches ahead of their “Next in Line” show Friday. 
Founded in Fall 2016, ART/EMIS brings together student creatives who explore intersectional feminism through film, dance, visual art, theatre, music, digital media and more. The club hosts monthly events focused on uplifting marginalized voices on campus, such as March’s staging of the multimedia art show Virgin Creek. 
ART/EMIS also produces around three large-scale creative projects per semester after accepting pitches from students twice a year. In November, the group hosted a comic book showcase and an immersive dramatic performance. Their latest project, “Next in Line,” was pitched originally by Lina Rehbein, who serves as the project’s creative director. 
Rehbein, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies, initially pitched her idea in October after hearing about the opportunity from her roommate. Since then, Rehbein has spent six months finding her team, thrifting fabrics, casting models, securing venues and creating accessories. 
“It’s just been a million things going on at once in the best way possible,” Rehbein said.
Shortly after ART/EMIS sponsored her idea, Rehbein recruited team members, mainly through posts on social media. Her current team consists of herself, eight designers and 13 models. 
Through this fashion show, Rehbein has combined her talents in fashion and sewing with her passion for sustainability, all while simultaneously connecting with peers who are equally invested in environmentally-friendly fashion.
“Everything [was] sourced from Goodwill, which has been tedious at times — a lot of digging, a lot of hours spent just rummaging through — but we found what we needed, and I think everyone really made the most out of whatever they did find,” Rehbein said.
“Next in Line” has worked as a new and inspiring creative outlet for student designers, including Rachel Bakke, a junior majoring in computer science. 
“I’ve always been crafty,” Bakke said. “I’ve always been interested in upcycling and hemming or fixing clothes that I currently have, but this has been the first time that I’ve actually made full outfits from scratch… [Majoring] in CS, you don’t have a lot of creative space and freedom. I’ve really gained that feeling of being an artist and a designer, and just experiencing that with other people too, building off each other’s ideas and having that exciting connection.”
Annie Zheng, a sophomore majoring in media arts and practice, works closely with the Next in Line team as a member of the ART/EMIS executive board. In her eyes, the inspiration behind the fashion show exemplifies ART/EMIS’ mission.
“The theme is royalty, but we’re reimagining it to not be Eurocentric,” Zheng said. “For this project, our entire team is so diverse — the models, the designers, the producers. There are a lot of people whose identities don’t really fall into the traditional, binary categories of gender, sexuality or other identity markers.”
The tickets for the event, which were released for free to the public March 25, sold out in less than four hours. Next in Line expects to host 125 guests at their show, premiering this Friday at 8 p.m. at the USC Hotel, which will feature performances from the Ocean Saints, a Los Angeles-based student DJ duo, and Ashley Taylor, a freshman majoring in music industry.
Though Rehbein remains unsure of the show’s future, she said she hopes the fashion show will be a recurring event and sees a demand for future fashion shows on campus. 
“There’s such a huge interest in fashion at USC given that we’re in L.A.,” Rehbein said. “And, it’s such an untapped field. I definitely wanted to create a space where everyone could have that creative voice, and then seeing their things up on a runway is super exciting.”

The same way you reevaluate whether you want to drop out at the end of each semester, there’s no better time to reevaluate your friendships than now!
That friend that gave you a backhanded compliment? Cut them off. Your bestie is talking about you behind your back? Have them square up. If there is one thing certain in life, it is that life is too short to spend it with people who do not value you.
However complicated your friendships are, Dr. Blingspice is here to help you confront your problems and reevaluate, remove or reset the relationships holding you back in life.
I am really worried about my friend. We were really close, but now she only comes to me with her problems and doesn’t take any of my advice. It’s really frustrating and draining because she keeps asking “Why does this keep happening to me,” and I’m (internally) saying “Cause you refuse to accept any solutions but keep complaining about the same things.” I shut up and nod my head now, but like she really needs help. What do I do?
Sometimes people need to fall on their asses a few times before they realize you’re right about something. If they do not listen to your sound advice, they eventually will.
A friend who does not want to be helped will not allow themselves to be. Everyone has a notch of stupidity and irrationality, and some people just have to eventually grow out of it through life experience — not through advice.
You have to wait till life teaches them their lesson; it eventually will. As Monique once said, “When you do clownery, the clown comes back to bite.” You have done your due diligence in helping them avoid it. If they want to stay in the circus, it is the jester’s fault.
As a generous advice giver, I rely on people’s personal clownery to write this column. Whether people take it or do not, it is not my problem. At that point, it is out of my control because I am aware of my power as a self-proclaimed advisor or, in this case, ringleader. 
Allow your friend to flop even if it pains you. They will know to come to you for advice when they get tired of being humbled.
My friend makes mean comments about me jokingly, but sometimes they don’t rub me the right way. The comments aren’t enough to cut them off, but I’m not sure they’re enough to confront them about it either. What should I do?
Chances are your friend doesn’t know it bothers you; confrontation is the way to go. People, including myself, can come across as unintentionally rude for the sake of a punchline.
Next time your friend makes a comment that doesn’t sit well, hint at them in a subtle way that you are uncomfortable with it. The worst that will happen is they continue, in which case, it’s up to you whether it bothers you enough to cut ties with them.
Alternatively, you can play their own game and make petty comments back. This can normalize it for both you and might alleviate your discomfort. The nature of your conversations is whatever you make them. If your friend wants it to be a “Wild ‘N Out” roast battle, give it your all.
I think my friend and I are too dependent on each and hinder our social outreach to other people. How do I go about valuing their friendship but also feeling like we should spend less time together and meet other people?
Dependence on other people only sets up disappointment. As important as you think you are, even if you’re Beyoncé, no one can be there for you 24/7 nor can every friend serve every purpose.
You do not have to explicitly tell your friend you should spend less time with one another — simply, start hanging out with other people until you have established new relationships. This allows you to find friends for every occasion: some to pretend to study with, a few to go clubbing with and others to have a wine night with. 
If your current friend asks why you have started hanging out with other people, simply tell them you’re trying to get your LinkedIn connections up. It is also none of their business, but if you want to give them an explanation, it is simply networking. Having several friends does not mean you do not value them; it implies that you have a social life.
Never restrict yourself to a single person because you never know if, or when, that person will disappoint you; bring some variety into your life.
Emanuel Rodriguez is a junior offering advice on students’ most pressing questions. He is also the digital managing editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Advice from Dr. Blingspice,” runs every other Wednesday.

Most people of color with textured hair in predominantly white spaces receive many unsolicited questions and comments regarding their hair every day. Individuals usually express their fascination through questions such as, “Can you brush it?” or “My hair is almost as frizzy as yours today!” However, the most common and of all is “Can I touch it?” 
These microaggressive comments stem from not only a strong “fascination” and ignorance but an even stronger implicit bias against textured hair. 
The implicit bias against textured hair can be found in various aspects of society. Black women make up a majority of the hair care industry, as they spend nine times more money than the average consumer on hair and beauty products. However, in stores such as Target or Walmart, products for Black hair can be found in a small “ethnic” section, far away from the rest of the hair products in the “beauty and self-care” section. Moreover, many hair products are marketed as “anti-frizz” or “tame.” The reasoning for these particular targeting and segmentation marketing strategies is to penetrate desirable beauty standards to the public through a cultural implicit bias. 
In 2016, the Perception Institute conducted the “good hair” study, which found tremendous political and social implications for Black women who wear their natural hair. The study demonstrated that races outside of Black women had an implicit bias toward textured hair. The women in the study rated textured hair as less beautiful, professional and sexy. Although Black women spend more time on their hair, they experience much more anxiety in regard to hair care.
According to the Perception Institute, “One in five [Black] women feel social pressure to straighten their hair for work — twice as many as white women.” This is an example of how Black women have not benefited from the new relaxed work cultures as other groups have. There are prevalent disparities in the standards for what is considered acceptable or professional between races in the workplace. 
Recent research conducted at Duke University and published by the Social Psychological and Personality Science found that job recruiters demonstrated an implicit bias against Black women during job recruitment. Recruiters were more likely to view Black women wearing natural hairstyles as unprofessional and less competent, and they were less likely to ask Black women to return for an interview. 
Hair discrimination is equally as prominent in schools. In 2018, a 16-year-old Black wrestler was forced to cut their dreads before their wrestling match to avoid being disqualified. The referee cut their hair with a pair of spare scissors until they were satisfied with the length. 
In 2019, CNN reported a Georgia elementary school faced backlash for putting large posters of Black hairstyles along the school hallway that deemed which styles were “appropriate” and “inappropriate,” even though the school’s dress code did not mention hairstyles.
There is a history of natural hair being unacceptable and forbidden in the workplace and schools. For many Black individuals, wearing natural hair is empowering because it represents a refusal to conform to Western beauty standards. The afro was an incredibly important staple during the Civil Rights Movement and was heavily solidified as a symbol of political activism by public figures and performers such as Nina Simone, who paired her natural hair with songs about freedom and inequality in America. The afro has subsequently been viewed as a symbol of liberty and self-expression by Black Americans and remains a symbol of rebellion and non-conformism by many white Americans. 
Government officials recently recognized this historical sentiment. In 2019, California was the first state to ban discrimination against hair and make a law that protects women who choose to wear their hair naturally at work. Other states have followed, including Massachusetts, which just passed a bill on March 30 banning hair discrimination. 
It is crucial that we begin to strip natural textured hair of its implicit bias because that will allow us to have more united classrooms, workplaces and communities. Hair has never been “just hair” in this society. Amongst all races and ethnicities, hair is an indication of self-worth, culture, confidence, wisdom and so much more. This concept needs to be validated by all people. Non-textured hair is not a symbol of superior character or ability. 
It is time to start consciously assessing and reflecting on your own biases and contributions to perpetuating a harmful beauty standard. In a society that claims it is working to become more inclusive, we cannot simply turn a blind eye to the mistreatment of people simply because they chose to wear their natural textured hair. Hair bias and discrimination are an important part of the narrative of racial disparities in work and academics spaces, and we must address it.

Over the last four days, USC baseball swept San José State in a 3-game series but lost 9-7 to the University of Hawaii Monday night. 
Redshirt senior outfielder Trevor Halsema hit 3 home runs and earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors. 
“It’s the same thing he’s brought all year,” Head Coach Jason Gill said. “Sometimes they fall, and sometimes they’re not, but he’s certainly had a really good week and it was good to see him get hot a little bit.” 
Redshirt sophomore pitcher Ethan Reed started the Trojans’  game against Hawaii but exited after the second inning in what would be a bullpen heavy game for the Trojans. 
“We don’t necessarily have a straight up Tuesday starter, so we’re trying to get as many guys work as possible,” Gill said. 
The Rainbow Warriors opened up the scoring, with redshirt sophomore shortstop Kyson Donahue bringing in junior infielder Dallas Duarte with an RBI double. The Trojans answered in the bottom of the first, with an RBI from both redshirt sophomore infielder Tyresse Turner and Halsema. 
Hawaii took an early lead after a four-run third inning. Junior utility player Jacob Igawa hit a three-run home run in the inning. USC redshirt junior pitchers Toby Spach and Garrett Clarke gave up 4 combined earned runs. 
In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Trojans stormed back with three runs, taking a 7-5 lead. Unfortunately for USC, the Rainbow came full circle as Hawaii scored 4 more runs, scattered across the remaining innings. 
Despite a game-packed schedule, sophomore infielder D’Andre Smith said that he looks forward to next weekend’s matchup against Pac-12 foe No. 5 Oregon State.
“Some guys are a little beat up, but coming Friday, we’ll be ready to go,” Smith said. “We’re really eager to get out against Oregon State. They’re having a great year.” 
While the Trojans fell short against Hawaii, the series against San José State yielded success for the Trojans. 
USC was in danger of losing the first game of the series entering the seventh inning, after the Spartans scored 5 runs to break even. A late home run from Halsema brought the Trojans back into the mix on their way to winning the game 7-6. 
Redshirt senior pitcher Isaac Esqueda got the start for the Trojans. He faced nine batters in under 2 innings of work, giving up 2 hits and 2 walks. 
San José State utility player Charles McAdoo proved to be a problem for the Trojan pitching staff, with each of his four at-bats ending with a hit. The sophomore had two RBIs, each coming early in the game. 
Redshirt sophomore outfielder Rhylan Thomas and redshirt sophomore outfielder Adrian Colon-Rosado also contributed to the Trojans’ comeback efforts. Thomas had 3 hits and one RBI, while Colon-Rosado scored 2 runs and had a hit. 
In Saturday’s game, USC again came from behind in the eighth inning to win another close game 7-5. Halsema, the Pac-12 Player of the Week, had another 2 home runs and scored the winning run after a sacrifice fly out from junior infielder Nick Lopez. Sophomore starting pitcher Tyler Stromsborg struggled in the first five innings, giving up 4 runs and 4 walks. 
The Trojans completed their sweep of San José State Sunday, defeating the Spartans 6-2. All 6 of USC’s runs came in the second inning, starting with a grand slam from redshirt sophomore infielder Johnny Olmstead. Lopez hit a single-run homer and Colon-Rosado hit an RBI single to end the Trojans’ scoring for the night. 
The Spartans scored runs in the third and fourth innings, and both came as a result of fielding errors from the Trojans. Sophomore starting pitcher Charlie Hurley threw for eight innings with no earned runs and only 2 hits. It took redshirt junior Carson Lambert only 14 pitches to close out the game for the Trojans. Lambert threw 2 strikeouts against three batters. 
With a few days to rest after a busy stretch, Gill’s Trojans continue to prepare for the upcoming series against Pac-12 opponent No. 5 Oregon State. 
“We’ve got to get to work on some of the things we need to get to work on,” Gill said. “We’re far from being as good as we can be, so we’ve just got to keep getting better.”
