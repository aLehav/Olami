Last month, University of California system President Janet Napolitano proposed a tuition hike for undergraduates. If approved, the cost of attendance could rise by as much as 5 percent in each of the next five years if the state does not increase funding for the system’s budget.
Currently, average costs for a full-time undergraduate California resident living on campus is $33,100 per year, with the number jumping to $55,978 for non-residents in the same situation. The proposed hikes could raise those figures by an estimated $3,000 by 2019, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Napolitano defended what would be the first rise in tuition in four years for the statewide system to help cover mounting pension costs and keep the schools competitive in terms of hiring new faculty and admitting more students. A portion of the funds would also be used to increase financial aid for students.
University administrators said that financial aid at USC has stable funding.
“Costs will always be a primary factor, financial aid also does play a large part, and especially here at USC since our aid packages are very generous. Our need-based aid averages $43,000 currently. It also helps that we have stable funding so there is no uncertainty about if our financial aid will or won’t continue,” said Thomas McWhorter, dean of financial aid at USC.
Nearly two-thirds of UC system students receive some sort of aid while attending school, with an average award of over $16,000 according to the University of California system website.
USC, a private institution that doesn’t charge students based on geography, estimates its yearly costs are $64,761 for a full-time undergraduate student living on campus at present time.
Tuitions and fees at USC are set by the Board of Trustees and have increased an average of 4.28 percent annually over the past five years.
“Any time an institution significantly increases its costs, that is going to have some sort of an impact. However, we aren’t going to be changing any of our recruitment practices or our messages based on that,” said Timothy Brunold, dean of admissions. “The increase will also contribute to the continued discussion that many people are having about the affordability of college.”
Newly re-elected Gov. Jerry Brown, who also serves as the official president of the Board of Regents for the UC system, voted against the tuition hike at the meeting. Brown is in the process of forming a committee to analyze current UC spending and reforming the current curriculum to help students graduate faster in a way to stem the proposed tuition increase. According to the Campaign for College Opportunity, 84 percent of students graduate from the UC system after six years.
On Tuesday, a group of Democratic lawmakers proposed an alternative to Napolitano’s measure. The proposition would cut funding for a newly established scholarship program focused on middle-class students and simultaneously raise tuition for out-of-state students only.
Napolitano added insight on the recent measure.
“The bill introduced today is a promising first step toward making sure that public higher education benefits Californians today and for generations to come, and we look forward to working with Senate Democrats and other elected officials to secure the state funding essential to this end,” she said in a statement.

It’s not every day one comes across a college student who has created a nonprofit organization to aid rural villages in Armenia. Tomik Vertanous, co-founder and president of Hyer United, represents a slim portion of college students who have taken a leap forward in nonprofit work overseas.
Vertanous, a junior studying political science, co-founded Hyer United, a nonprofit organization which seeks to improve villages in the Republic of Artsakh in Armenia by gathering and shipping expired medical supplies and equipment. He created the organization after he came across the harsh set of realities for those who live in the poorest regions within Armenia.
Vertanous was compelled to make viable change in his homeland when he began to compare the dichotomy of available resources in America and Armenia. After transferring to USC in 2013, Vertanous began his search to recruit passionate students to join his nonprofit. Though many members of the nonprofit are USC students and alumni, any college student who desires to help can join.
“The region that we help is a developing region, and it is a war-torn region. Seeing the pictures and the kids that live there and seeing the lack of basic necessities that they don’t have really inspired us,” Vertanous said. “By looking at many of the issues that are surrounding the Armenian community now, here and internationally, I just saw fit to rather partake in those — partake in my own venture in benefitting Armenia in the fastest way I could possibly do it.”
Anita Barsekhi, the public relations director of Hyer United, discussed how her Armenian culture plays a large role in stimulating her passion to work for the non-profit.
“In our group of friends, everyone is very proud to be Armenian. We are really devoted to helping our country because when you go back and you see what it is like over there and you see how the people are living, it’s really sad because they don’t have the opportunities that we have here and by us living in the diaspora we have everything in our hands,” Barsekhi said.
She added that the difference in living situations inspired her work.
“But we look back at it, and we are like, ‘We come from here but our people don’t have this and it’s not fair,’” she said. “So we want to do what we can to help them out, because that is our homeland. That is where we are from.”
Vertanous understands the complexities of the global poverty crisis. His nonprofit organization represents a grassroots movement to build infrastructure within the regions of Armenia that need the most help. By studying political science at USC, he discussed how he learned the fundamental goal for his nonprofit organization.  Vertanous explained it is not to create dependency among the impoverished peoples in Armenia, but to provide the infrastructure to build self-sustaining communities.
“One fundamental concept that the charity coincides with is that we are like a bandage towards developing countries,” he said. “We are not a permanent resolution to their problems. We are just there to stop the bleeding and to help them recuperate from any kind of problems they are having, so they can sustain themselves in the long term — because aid only goes so far and we do not want to build dependency — we want to build self-sustainment.”
Vertanous said that he hopes the charity will serve only a temporary need.
“We are not looking to be a permanent charity,” he said. “I hope that this charity does not need to exist in the next 50 years. I hope that the aid goes a long way in helping stop the bleeding and then, having the people just build their own infrastructure, economy and providing their own healthcare.”
Since the nonprofit started, Vertanous has partaken in more than seven shipments, which constitutes about 80 boxes and hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical equipment. In order to ensure a large delivery during the holiday season, members had to ship boxes two months ago.  Due to the weight of the medical supplies, shipping must be done overseas and estimated arrival time for each shipment may be anywhere from two to three months.
According to Vertanous, receiving enough medical supplies to donate has never been an issue. Allocating the funds for shipping costs and finding dedicated members to help do so, however, has been difficult.
“It is hard finding a lot of members because no members get paid and neither do any of us. Almost 90 percent of our funds go to shipping expenses … Once we take hold of the equipment and medical supplies, we essentially inventory all of it, package it up, go accordingly to what [villages] need for the time being, consult with any oncologists or physicians on board with the charity, see whether or not [medical supplies] will be sufficient enough and from there we send it out,” Vertanous said.
Vertanous discussed the organization’s biggest accomplishment throughout the years.
“The actual positive impact we’ve had in the region shows,” Vertanous said. “I definitely feel like that was our biggest accomplishment through the years — seeing the help and seeing how far it went towards helping so many kids and individuals within those regions.”

Yahoo! On the Road 2014, the second annual cross-country roadtrip entertaining music fans nationwide, brings Iggy Azalea with D.J. Justin Credible to Bovard Auditorium at 8 p.m.
Fancy · Special Events Committee and Yahoo! set up booths for students to try new Yahoo! and Verizon wireless products as well as get giveaways. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
The Special Events Committee received an email from Yahoo! at the beginning of the summer expressing an interest in coming to USC for the On the Road tour. The purpose of the tour is to promote live performances at colleges. The tour will end Thursday with the concert at Bovard, an event exclusively for USC students.
Special Events Committee and Yahoo! set up booths for students to try out new Yahoo! and Verizon Wireless gadgets, grab giveaways and get a promo code for the concert on Tuesday and Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Finger Fountain and Pardee Plaza. The booth will be open Thursday until in Pardee Plaza from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., and the Yahoo tour bus will be on Trousdale Parkway until 5 p.m.
After entering the promo code online, students get a voucher for one to two students to watch the concert. Twelve hundred students can attend for free. A crowd of students is expected to line up outside of Bovard before 8 p.m., as more vouchers were distributed than there will be seats available.
“It’s a really popular artist obviously. We’ve already overbooked the tickets,” said Denise Rockstroh, director of the Special Events Committee. “Even around campus, everyone’s really excited about it. I’ve gotten a lot of questions and emails and text messages saying, ‘Oh, how do I get in? What can I do?’ And I hear random people on campus talking about the concert. I think it’s definitely one of our most successful tours because there’s so much attention.”
Bovard was chosen as the location of the tour’s last concert because Iggy Azalea and Live Nation wanted a more intimate show.
Azalea was nominated for six American Music Awards and won “Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist” and “Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album” for her debut album, The New Classic.
The show will stream live at 8 p.m. on Yahoo! Screen, an entertainment app that allows users to stream Saturday Night Live skits, Live Nation concerts, Vevo music videos, NFL highlights and other Yahoo original content.

Beginning in the summer 2015 term, the Marshall School of Business will be offering a new Master of Science degree in marketing. The latest addition to a series of  Specialized Masters Programs offered through the school, the M.S. in marketing will offer a chance for students to hone in on advanced skills that are needed day-to-day in the business.
The program will take one year of full-time study to finish or 21 months part time, meaning the first students to finish the program will graduate in May of 2016. The degree is made up of 10 courses, including a core of three required courses and seven other courses. In total, this adds up to about half the course load of the full time M.B.A. program offered through Marshall.
According to Diane Badame, academic director of the full-time M.B.A. program and professor of clinical marketing, the program is particularly attractive to individuals who are already active in the workforce but want to bring their marketing skills and knowledge to a higher level. Many students prefer the relatively short amount of time it takes to graduate from this program in comparison to the M.B.A. program. With fewer credits needed to graduate, the program also costs only half as much as the M.B.A., an attractive feature for many young professionals.
Though Marshall offers programs of study for undergraduates who are interested in marketing, Badame said that in many cases, an undergraduate degree is not enough.
“There’s a real need for people to have more expertise in marketing,” she said. “Employers want more advanced skills than those taught in undergraduate programs, as these are becoming increasingly important. Marketing drives profit, and that keeps a business running.”
Because of this demand from employers, the administration at Marshall decided to spearhead the new program. The idea was first developed in August of this year and was approved just two months later. Currently, Marshall is making an effort to reach out to former students through USC’s alumni publications to spread the word about the program.
Though programs like the M.S. in marketing have been offered at institutions around the world for many years, Marshall’s program will have certain qualities that won’t readily be found elsewhere. Because of the university’s numerous professional schools and colleges, students in the M.S. marketing program will have the unique advantage of choosing an area in their studies. Students can choose to take classes in the School of Cinematic Arts or the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in order to really specialize in the area that most benefits them.
“I think it’s the interdisciplinary approach that will really set our master’s program apart. Not every school has access to a world-class film school, for example, but our students will have the opportunities to really delve in on an area of their choosing,” Badame said.
Currently, the program is accepting applications for its inaugural class. It is suggested that applicants have two years of experience in the workforce prior to attending the program, which will take place on campus until the summer of 2017. After that point, the program will be offered online exclusively.

Undergraduate Student Government held a Lean In Circle Leader Workshop event on Wednesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
360 degrees · Alana Victor, right, co-director of USG external relations, and junior Maggie McMahon, left, host a workshop event Wednesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Lean In, a book authored by Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, spurred the idea for “Lean In circles,” which primarily focuses on creating small group discourse to empower women and men on social issues. Lean In circles consist of eight to 10 group members who meet every month to discuss issues in a private setting. Wednesday night’s workshop, sponsored by USG Co-Director of External Affairs Alana Victor and Maggie McMahon, a Lean In circle leader and junior majoring in architecture, was designed to create a network of leaders who can build a presence for future groups on campus.
By joining a Lean In circle, group members are encouraged to build on the facets of confidentiality, communication and commitment. According to Sandberg, Lean In circles were created to build upon the concept of peer support. In order to build peer support, Sandberg and Lean In circle leaders are asked to build the presence of circles across the nation by networking and sharing the concept of building relevant discourse among their peers to share personal struggles, thoughts and topics.
USG Vice President Rini Sampath first became involved with the Lean In foundation last year.
“I wrote a column for the Daily Trojan called ‘Leaning In,’ and it was picked up by Sheryl Sandberg and the Lean In foundation and was recognized by them.”
Since then, Sampath has been in communication with the organization. They then emailed her about the Lean In circles.
“What the Lean In circles seek to do is establish these groups and communities of women on campuses all over the United States, everywhere in the country really, and foster a safe environment for us to discuss what it’s like to be a woman, how we can help each other succeed. ”
Victor kicked off the event by showing members in attendance a brief video from Sheryl Sandberg entitled “Power of Circles.”  Student Lean In circle leaders Victor and McMahon further elaborated on one of the key facets of Sandberg’s discourse, which promotes individuals to ask themselves, “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?”
Students were then given the opportunity to take “connection cards,” which had them answer questions such as, “If you could give one piece of advice to your younger self what would it be?” and, “What are you most proud of?” Victor further discussed the key components of Lean In circles by giving a brief presentation. Victor cited work from Sandberg’s website which discussed the critical importance of group trust, commitment, investment and attendance.
McMahon encouraged her peers to establish a circle within their community of interest.
“Statistics have shown that women involved in circles have been more confident and more able to use their skill sets in the workplace and in other areas of social life,” McMahon said.
Victor said she envisions Lean In circles on campus becoming a hub for discussion in the future.
“I think having a network of these Lean In circles on our campus is really going to create more discussion and more dialogue about empowering women … It really starts getting our students active and integrating these ideas into our daily lives, so by taking time once a month to have these discussions in small groups, it can really just start there,” Victor said.
Many students who left the event indicated significant interest towards developing their own Lean In circles.
Gillian Chugg, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said she hoped to create a circle of her own.
“I think that Lean In circles are a really powerful way to empower women,” Chugg said. “I think it’s really important that we do empower women especially at this current stage of modern life, and I am interested in starting my own Lean In circle, possibly with a group of girls from my sorority.”

Passion, courage, and true romance will be at a high on Dec. 7 at The Roxy Theatre. Grammy Award-winning artist Estelle will be playing an intimate show that will have everyone singing along to her holiday tunes, hit song “American Boy” and material from her new album, True Romance, which will be released early next year.

“The show will be a complete performance of my new album with a few favorites thrown in between,” Estelle said. “But mostly explaining what the album is about, which is trying to find out what I am, who I am and where I want to be.”
Throughout the concert, the audience can witness Estelle’s journey from being a featured artist in Kanye West’s song to releasing a powerful album of her own.
“[My musical direction] has grown with my growth as a person,” she said. “From young and cocky to wise, confident and informed. Growth with a little bit of fun is key.”
Every song on the album reflects an element of the theme of the show, with the inspiration being Estelle’s life. The lead single, “Conqueror,” has been featured in the film Addicted. In this track, she emphasizes believing in yourself even if others around you are bringing you down.
Despite being an eclectic album, True Romance has a flow about it that will entice listeners through its end. “Something Good/Devotion” is the perfect energizing song to pump up the day. Its strong beat and catchy melody will have you singing and dancing along to Estelle’s powerful voice. In contrast, “Time Share (Suite 509)” is a more soulful piece that displays Estelle’s vocals and vulnerable side. Similarly, “Make Her Say (Beat It Up)” exhibits her emotion, but will be more enjoyable for those who are fans of the dark undertones in Iggy Azaela’s “Black Widow.” Though “Silly Girls” has a light and fun name, the track is slower than the rest, illuminating the passionate lyrics put forth by Estelle. Her own personal favorite is “Gotcha Love.”
“It was written with such heart. It also was one of the first songs I wrote for this album,” Estelle said.
When she isn’t performing or making music, Estelle works on more personal projects. In 2010, she founded the All of Me Foundation, which serves to fundraise for programs that will educate and broaden the horizons of youth by providing real-life work experience, expanding community service projects and organizing decision making activities to boost self-esteem.

Though her name is not something you’d hear every day, you may have heard Kiesza in her hit single “Hideaway” last February. The song premiered at the number one spot on the UK Official Singles Chart, and the music video garnered her more attention, parading around London in one take even though the singer had a broken rib at the time. Now the Calgary, Canada, native is out with her full-length album, Sound of a Woman, and she continues to intrigue with her ability to weave ’90s beats and modern tones.
Charming sound · Kiesza’s “Sound of a Woman,” a powerful ballad, is a standout track from her debut album of the same name. – Photo courtesy of Kiesza
The album starts with “Hideaway,” which is apt considering it is the song that launched her career. Even though listeners will have heard this track before, it is still just as mesmerizing and experimental this time around.
“Taking me higher than I’ve ever been before,” sings Kiesza, with soul and power behind her voice and a ’90s techno beat accompaniment. The song is original and fresh, but unfortunately, the album that follows becomes redundant very quickly.
Each song is strong in its own right, but Kiesza’s intense vocals and clear ’90s influence quickly grow old in Sounds of a Woman. Songs blend together and there are few standouts. Unfortunately, her experimental style on this album proves to be too much to handle. There are several highlights, however, which make Sound of a Woman worth listening to.
There is no doubt Kiesza has drive and passion, and her background is proof. The songstress served in the Canadian Navy, competed in a Miss Universe Canada Pageant and pursued a career in ballet before transitioning to music. There isn’t an artist today that has a resume as interesting. When she did decide to make music, she immediately gained recognition, getting radio play and a live performance on a radio show only months after starting her career. She then studied at Berklee College of Music, a prestigious music school in Massachusetts, before travelling to New York and landing her first hit, “Oops,” about unprotected sex. Later, she stated that the song was made as a joke, but the tongue-in-cheek style she defined in “Oops” stuck with her, and her new album, though not as humorous, still has the same light-hearted energy. With so much talent and drive, it is a shame that this album doesn’t meet expectations.
Musically, Kiesza is in a category of her own. She has a soft, comforting sound that somehow feels rigid and tough as well, and her influences shine through in the backbone of every song. She has a sound reminiscent of ’80s and ’90s techno artists like Depeche Mode, and she even covers Haddaway’s 1993 “What Is Love,” an anthem of its generation that is still almost universally known today.
She also has clear roots in hip-hop, featuring artists Joey Bada$$ and Mick Jenkins on tracks, and using one of the most universally known hip-hop backbeats, known as Funky Drummer, in her track “Vietnam.” “Bad Thing” with Joey Bada$$ is definitely a standout, as is “Vietnam” and a slow jam titled “So Deep,” which sounds like SBTRKT’s “Wildfire” with more soul.
“Paint me with your body / I want to be the canvas that’s underneath,” sings Kiesza, with a wispy voice that sets the tone of “So Deep” and emphasizes the song’s hip-hop backbeat. There are certainly standouts on Sounds of a Woman, but it might take a little digging to find these gems.
One such gem is the title track, “Sound of a Woman,” which is an epic ballad about a regretful relationship, punctuated by lyrics like “I have no more tears to cry” that are both emotive and powerful.
Kiesza talks a lot about failed relationships on Sound of a Woman, ultimately setting the tone of the whole album. Even though many of her songs feel light and sensual, they are lyrically heartbreaking, as the artist tells of her experiences. It makes sense that Kiesza would cover “What is Love” as it fits lyrically with the album’s tone, even if the original is a lot more based in pop than her slow, piano only cover.
Closing out the album is another slow, acoustic track titled “Cut Me Loose,” and it leaves the listener with a hope that feels ripped out of a Disney musical. This doesn’t make it a bad track by any means, but it does have a certain cheesiness that is an acquired taste.
Ultimately Kiesza’s Sound of a Woman suffers from a misunderstanding of audience. The Canadian singer has a powerful, emotive voice and great composition, but her songs attempt too much. In certain songs, there are Disney-esque vocals with lyrically mature themes, ’90s hip-hop beats and techno house riffs, all culminating in an album that is jumbled and chaotic. Kiesza’s unique sound still needs refining, and unfortunately it shows on Sound of a Woman.

The writers of Life Partners wanted to explore a different relationship than what most romantic comedies address. Instead of focusing on romance, the film portrays the strong bond between two best friends as they deal with dramatic life transitions in a hilarious and genuine light.
Sasha (Leighton Meester) and Paige (Gillian Jacobs), have a friendship that is most familiar to everyone: hosting weekly America’s Next Top Model marathons, complete with cheap wine and knowing everything about each other, right down to the preferred pillow type. But as they turn 29 in the film, they realize that adult responsibilities are no longer just far away worries, but instead, reality. As the two women grow older, their personality differences become more apparent.
Neither Sasha nor Paige are known for serious relationships. This all changes, however, when Paige meets Tim (Adam Brody), who she changes her lifestyle for, in hope that their romance can blossom into something serious. Meanwhile, Sasha continues to have casual flings, avoiding serious relationships. Sasha and Paige’s friendship changes slowly throughout the course of the movie. Small behavioral shifts can be seen. Paige starts skipping out on T.V. marathons for date nights with Tim, and after being ditched multiple times, Sasha feels replaced.
These are challenges that many pairs of best friends experience in real life a. As one friend hits a new phase or a coming of age, the relationship can get strained, making staying on the same page something that no longer comes naturally or effortlessly. Life Partners examines Sasha’s and Paige’s different approaches to adulthood, which proves to be the ultimate test of their friendship. In one of the movie’s more emotional scenes, Sasha pushes Paige to admit that her relationship with Tim has considerably impacted her life. “Nothing changed for you, it just changed for me,” she says tearfully. Growing up is scary for everyone, and it is even scarier to do when a best friend seems worlds away.
What makes Life Partners special is that it empathizes with young people’s fear of getting old, and it reveals the insecurities people can have about chasing their dreams. Sasha has been out of school for quite some time, working as a secretary while she gets her music career off the ground on the side. But after years of this, she still isn’t sure that music is what she wants to do. As a result, she unhappily clings to her youth’s fun familiarities: meaningless hookups, late-night mozzarella stick runs and her best friend, who is surpassing her romantically and professionally. Everyone is a little bit afraid of failure, of not being good enough or of not living life to the fullest, and Sasha’s character, especially, hits home with those fears.
Another one of the movie’s strengths is its sprinkling of comedic levity throughout the well-done script, served mostly by witty banter, Tim’s ironic T-shirts and quoting of movies, and Sasha’s and Paige’s inside jokes. Life Partners doesn’t try too hard to be funny because it doesn’t have to. The actors are talented at delivering funny and uncomfortable material in a way that is familiar and relatable to the audience.
Meester’s effortless performance as a funny free spirit is a refreshing respite from her Blair Waldorf days on The CW’s Gossip Girl, and Brody, all grown up from his years on The O.C., plays the perfect fiancé for Paige. Jacobs’ face is a newer one, but her presence and chemistry with the other characters makes her ceaselessly fun to watch. Most importantly, Jacobs and Meester play believable best friends. Their flaws — Paige’s stubbornness and Sasha’s childishness — cause tension in their friendship, but they love each other all the same.
Also notable about Life Partners is that even though Sasha and several supporting characters are lesbians, the movie wasn’t intended by the writers, one straight and one gay, to be a niche film. The writers wanted to universalize the movie so that they could represent the gay community “without focusing a narrative on ‘coming out’ or emphasizing the politics” of Sasha’s sexuality. This goal comes across well: Sasha’s sexuality is a central part of the storyline, but it doesn’t try to send a message. Rather, it adds another interesting layer to her character and her friendship with Paige.
Life Partners is an easy-to-watch, entertaining movie with a feel-good vibe. It addresses the common, daunting concerns of adulthood: finding a lifelong partner, a fulfilling career and overall satisfaction with life. It shows that relationships — friendships included — take work to maintain, but if they’re meant to be, they will survive the challenges they face. Best friends will always be there for each other.

There’s something almost unbelievable about the life of Louis Zamperini, the USC alumnus whose life story propels Angelina Jolie’s new film Unbroken. His story reads like a series of Oscar-winning movie plots. He rose above adversity to distinguish himself competing in the 1936 Olympic games, recalling Chariots of Fire. His plane was shot down during the second World War and he survived adrift on the Pacific Ocean for 47 days, evoking shades of Life of Pi. Finally, as in Bridge on the River Kwai, he endured two years in a Japanese POW camp, and still emerged with his spirit intact. Seeing the sheer amount of inspirational life events in Zamperini’s story, one isn’t surprised to see that it was adapted into its own film, earning increasing awards buzz by the day. Despite this, the process to get Unbroken made was far from the slam-dunk it looks like now.
Long time coming · The film rights for Louis Zamperini’s autobiography were originally bought by Universal in 1956 but, due to setbacks, the movie based on his life is only coming out this Christmas. Unbroken is directed by Angelina Jolie and stars Jack O’Connell as Zamperini. – Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures
In fact, studios have been struggling to bring Zamperini’s story to the big screen since 1956. To give a sense of how long the project has been percolating, the actor originally slated to play Zamperini was none other than a pre-Some Like it Hot Tony Curtis. He eventually dropped out of the project to play Antonius in Stanley Kubrick’s Spartacus, and the Zamperini project was stashed. Cast aside like countless other scripts, the screenplay laid untouched by studios for four decades. It wasn’t until 1998 when Matthew Baer, the producer of Unbroken, saw a documentary about Zamperini, that the story gained any traction again. “When I first saw the documentary in 1998 that CBS Sports had made, I thought it was such a remarkable story of survival and hope. Especially in seeing the footage of Lou [Zamperini] running the torch into Nagano. And I was so surprised that nobody had told the story before,” Baer said.
But, despite tabbing a young Nicolas Cage in the role and getting the gears churning on this project, it took another 16 years, and several setbacks, for Unbroken to finally become a reality.
It is easy to make the analogy that, to get made, the film had to run a similar gauntlet to Zamperini’s, but the more interesting question is why a story with so many ready-for-film moments was so difficult to get made.
Funnily enough, Baer credits that same wealth of life events as one of the main reasons for the difficulty in getting the film made. “The singular problem in making Lou [Zamperini’s] life into a film is that its such a big story and we had to try a variety of approaches over the years in terms of how long the story goes,” Baer said.
The story went through several rewrites, as Baer and a series of writers struggled to pare the story down into a workable size for a feature film. But, as is often the case, it took until a director with a vision and some clout to finally get the project off of the ground.
In the case of Unbroken, that director was Angelina Jolie. Despite having only directed one other feature film, Jolie brought a vision for the film that impressed Baer. “She had a very clear vision of what she wanted and…[Jolie] has a lot of passion for stories that she wants to tell. Particularly it was what she wanted to do with the script made a great deal of sense and then what her directorial vision was, was included in that,” Baer said. Once Jolie was spearheading the project, everything else seemed to fall into place.
One of the most important pieces of the puzzle was finding an actor to step into Louis Zamperini’s shoes. Eventually, after being noticed for his work on Skins, Jack O’Connell was tabbed as the successor from Curtis and Cage for the role. “Angie [Jolie] felt very strongly he was the right person because he has so much in common with Lou [Zamperini] in terms of independence and strong will,” Baer said. “Specifically you could just tell that his feisty spirit was exactly right for the port.” O’Connell quickly took to the role and has been generating awards buzz for his emotionally charged performance. Baer also credited Jolie for drawing from her considerable acting experience to give O’Connell plenty of guidance as to the nuances of his character. The rest of the cast is filled with young, up-and-coming talent as well. Garrett Hedlund, Domhnall Gleeson and Jai Courtney are all actors on the rise and fill important roles in the film. Baer also highlighted the work of Takamasa Ishihara, who provided a powerful performance as Zamperini’s primary tormentor at the POW camp during the war.
Another crucial piece was the addition of the incomparable Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, to the team. The brothers, who were connected to the project because they have the same agent as Jolie, joined late in the game and rewrote the script, which had already passed through the hands of several writers. The script given to them was already essentially the finished product, but Baer credits their masterful touch as crucial to the film.
“Joel and Ethan [Coen] did a number of really crucial things in the structure of the script. And then very specifically [they] obviously have such a beautiful feel for dialogue that is concise yet meaningful. So there are loads of examples of small moments that they gave throughout the script.” The Coen brothers are film royalty, and it is a testament to the influence that someone with the connections that Jolie has can bring to a film on top of her directorial talent.
Louis Zamperini’s life story seems made to order for an inspirational film, so much so, that it’s been an almost six-decade struggle to present it believably on the big screen. Finally, with the impressive talent that has come together around the story’s champion Baer, it seems there will finally be a fitting tribute to the man’s unbelievable life.

Well, it’s over. The Pac-12 football season came and went in a flurry of exhausting games, thrilling finishes and broken records. With only Friday’s conference championship left to play, a solid half of the Pac-12 can claim a spot in the College Football Playoff rankings, with three of those teams in the top-15. No. 2 Oregon has the inside track to an NCAA playoff berth, while the upstart Arizona Wildcats would also have a strong postseason case with a win on Friday. Ducks’ quarterback Marcus Mariota is the frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy, and several players — including USC redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler — have used this season as a springboard for future Heisman campaigns. To cap things off, USC junior defensive end Leonard Williams could be chosen No. 1 overall in next spring’s NFL draft. So yeah, 2014 has been a pretty good year for the Pac-12 and an eye-opening one for the rest of the nation.
Way back in mid-October, when I gave out my midseason conference awards, I mentioned how crazy the year had been to that point. As they say, I hadn’t seen anything yet. In that spirit, and in response to a Pac-12.com poll, here are some of my favorite moments from a wild season.
Down go the Cardinal
With one sack of Stanford quarterback Kevin Hogan, USC senior linebacker J.R. Tavai set the course for the entire the Pac-12 football season.
“To be honest, it felt like a normal play,” Tavai said way back on Sept. 8, after his forced fumble secured a 13-10 for the Trojans. “But making a play that big comes once in a while. When the opportunity comes, you just gotta take it.”
Tavai’s hit sent Stanford on a downward spiral, and the Cardinal’s 7-5 record was the team’s worst mark since 2008. Though head coach David Shaw’s squad ended the season on a high note with a 31-10 bludgeoning of UCLA, Stanford’s regression allowed Oregon to seize control of the Pac-12 north with little to no competition.
NeuHeisman
This was supposed to be UCLA’s year. The Bruins clocked in at No. 7 in the AP preseason rankings, and expectations were sky high for quarterback Brett Hundley and the boys from Westwood. Though the team’s up-and-down regular season ended one win short of a Pac-12 Championship berth, UCLA’s postseason dreams were very much alive going into a marquee matchup with Texas on Sept. 13. Unfortunately, the Bruins faced the Longhorns without Hundley, and after two shaky wins with the Heisman candidate at the helm, things did not look good for head coach Jim Mora’s squad. But it wouldn’t be Pac-12 football if everything went as planned.
In one of the most touching and surreal moments I’ve seen on television, backup quarterback Jerry Neuheisel led the Bruins on a game-winning drive while his dad — former UCLA head coach Rick Neuheisel — cheered him on in the Pac-12 Networks’ San Francisco studio. The Bruins picked up a 20-17 win, and the family got a memory that will last a lifetime.
Answered prayers
How many Hail Mary passes were completed in the Pac-12 this season? In the immortal words of Lebron James, “not one, not two, not three, not four … ” O.K., there were only three, but boy, did they come at memorable moments.
Arizona wideout Austin Hill started the trend, hauling in a 47-yard touchdown in the final seconds of a Sept. 20 victory over Cal. Only a week later, Kessler found sophomore wide receiver Darreus Rogers for a 48-yard score just before halftime of a win over Oregon State.
In a perfect example of the nuthouse that is the Pac-12, the next week brought a third Hail Mary pass, once again of the game-winning variety. Weirdly, I don’t remember this one as well. Arizona State was involved. It’s possible USC may have been there as well. Who really knows? Either way, these exciting moments were more than an aberration. They are a sign of a deep, talented conference with little separation between the top teams. And there’s nothing wrong with that.
Mannion’s Moment
This season didn’t go as planned for Oregon State. Coming off of a promising seven-win campaign, the Beavers finished 5-7, one win short of bowl eligibility. That did not stop quarterback Sean Mannion, however, who cemented himself among the Pac-12’s greatest ever signal-callers during a Nov. 1 loss to Cal. Mannion passed Matt Barkley’s career mark of 12,327 yards, becoming the conference’s most prolific passer of all-time. The record helped salvage a difficult season in Corvallis, Oregon, and will likely propel Mannion into a prime spot in the NFL draft.
Scooby snack
Many Pac-12 players had outstanding years, but few had the sheer impact of Arizona linebacker Scooby Wright III. Pundits are favorably comparing Wright’s 2014 season to Manti Te’o’s 2012 campaign, in which the Notre Dame linebacker finished second in Heisman Trophy voting. The statistics are certainly there; Wright’s 139 tackles, 27 tackles for loss and six forced fumbles all rank first or tied for first in the conference. Statistics, however, cannot describe the moment that defined Wright’s season and established the Wildcats as a legitimate national contender.
Late in the fourth quarter of Arizona’s Oct. 2 upset of No. 2 Oregon, the Ducks had the ball with an opportunity to tie the game. In a matchup of the Pac-12’s eventual offensive and defensive players of the year, Wright sacked Mariota at the Ducks’ 39-yard-line, stripping the ball with one hand and sealing a 31-24 victory. The play crushed Oregon’s dream of an undefeated season and helped set up Friday’s all-important rematch.
All of these moments capture the beauty and pain of college football, a sport that allowed Washington State quarterback Connor Halliday to throw for an NCAA-record 734 pass yards in a single game — and still lose. The Pac-12 encapsulates everything I love about football; cutting-edge schemes, unique atmospheres, weekly upsets and the joy/agony of never knowing what’ll happen next. Here’s to 2014, and bring on next season!

For six years, head coach Jovan Vavic and USC have occupied the throne of collegiate men’s water polo. And after claiming six straight national championships, the kings are back for more.
Ring my Bell · Sophomore driver Nick Bell figures to be a key part of USC’s attack on Saturday. Bell has 22 goals in 29 matches this season. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
Having defeated Whittier in a play-in game on Nov. 29 to reach their 10th consecutive NCAA final four, the USC men’s water polo team is all in for title number seven this weekend. In order to retain their crown, however, the No. 3 Trojans will have to overcome its demons in the form of No. 1 Stanford and No. 2 UCLA.
The Cardinal and the Bruins are the only teams against whom the Trojans have a losing record this season, going 0-2 versus Stanford and 1-3 against UCLA. Going up against the dangerous attackers Bret Bonanni and Alex Bowen, who have blasted the net 85 and 57 times for the Cardinal, respectively, the Trojans know their defense will have to be on point this weekend.
“The focus is on defense,” Vavic said. “As always, defense wins championships, so we have been spending quite a bit of time on different defensive schemes, but you have to have a complete game. You have to be able to execute in man-down situations. It’s going to be very important to be very sharp in transition defense because both Stanford and UCLA are excellent counterattack teams.”
Much of the Trojans’ difficulty with Stanford, however, has also come at the offensive end. The team only tallied four goals in the two sides’ second meeting on Nov. 22. Yet from the depth of the young Trojan squad, sophomore driver Nick Bell is confident in his team’s scoring ability this time around.
“We just have so many offensive threats, when they take away one we have another one right behind him,” Bell said. “I really don’t think they’re going to be able to stop us.”
The Trojans will meet the Cardinal in the NCAA tournament semifinals on Dec. 6, and, if they are able to advance, will likely take on the Bruins in the finals on Dec. 7, barring an upset to No. 6 UC San Diego. For the first time in nearly a decade, the Trojans are ranked below No. 1 at the final four and will have to play the role of underdog. Vavic and his team nevertheless embrace this unfamiliar spot.
“Even though we didn’t win it in 2006 or 2007, the last nine years heading into the NCAAs we were always ranked number one,” Vavic said. “It is a different feeling, a new challenge, and I really like these new challenges.”
Senior driver Kostas Genidounias believes such a position will work to the Trojans’ advantage.
“It’s weird, but it’s good being the underdog, because sometimes, they underestimate you,” Genidounias said. “Like we’ve said before, you should never underestimate the champions … These past two weeks have been good weeks for us in practice, and I think we’re going to be ready for the games.”
Along with winning three straight NCAA championships with the Trojans, Genidounias set the USC men’s water polo record last week against for most career goals at 255. Entering his last tournament as a Trojan, Genidounias will look to add to that tally and lift the Trojans en route to his fourth championship before riding off into the sunset. Genidounias noted the importance of not letting his emotions get to him in the championship tournament.
“It’s definitely an emotional feeling, an emotional moment — my last games as a Trojan,” Genidounias said. “But no one should let these emotions take over our capabilities of what we’re able to do.”
In a team more than half made up of freshmen, the contributions of the team’s seniors this season — Genidounias, redshirt driver Rex Butler, driver Marc Vondeweidt and redshirt two-meter Max Hurst-Mendoza — has been invaluable to Vavic. The tournament, however, will become the underclassmen’s time to shine, Vavic said.
“In the NCAAs and these key championship matches, really so much depends on these upperclassmen to show the younger guys the lead and tell them what to expect, and quite a bit of that happens before the NCAAs,” Vavic said. “Once you’re there, the younger players really need to be ready. They have to be ready to perform, they’re going to be left open. They’re going to be the ones forced to take a shot because [the other teams are] going to cover your best player.”
Entering with a young team and as an underdog, Vavic lauded his team for getting so far already.
“I don’t think we have anything to lose, to be honest — this team has already overachieved,” Vavic said. “You have Long Beach who’s loaded with seniors. Santa Barbara — loaded with seniors. Cal — very, very talented. Many of these teams, this was the year they should be beating us. And yet again here we are, going to the NCAAs.”
Feeling no pressure for that seventh straight championship, Vavic expects this season’s title to be anyone’s for the taking in La Jolla, California. The title match will take place on Sunday.
“Everything is definitely equal right now,” Vavic said. “Every single team going to the final four is equally capable of winning the national championship. It always comes down to who has the strongest desire to be a champion. This is going to be fun.”

The USC women’s basketball team looks to build on recent success this weekend as the squad travels to Moraga, California, to take on Saint Mary’s on Saturday, Dec. 6, at 5:30 p.m.
Air Jordan · Redshirt sophomore guard Jordan Adams is averaging 10.3 points per game through USC’s first six contests this season. Adams started 24 times last season, averaging 2.8 points and 3.5 rebounds per game. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (5-1) are in the midst of a five-game winning streak and are coming off winning the SMU Thanksgiving Classic in Dallas, Texas, last weekend. USC picked up an 88-67 win over Sam Houston State, with freshman guard McKenzie Calvert leading the team with 19 points. The Women of Troy then overcame a slow start and five-point halftime deficit against SMU to pull out a 64-57 win in the championship game.
Standout senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama was named the tournament’s MVP, tallying a combined 20 points, 16 rebounds and eight assists over the two games.
“For me, it’s not necessarily a winning streak,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “We take one game at a time, and we’ve been playing hard. We’ve been playing defense … and when you put those two together, I think you can come away with the win on anyone’s court. Our defense has been good; our rebounding, which has allowed us to get out on our fast-break; and last game against SMU our halfcourt execution was really impressive. Every game has been somewhat stepping it up, and I think we’re starting to come together as a team.”
Vaioletama leads a balanced USC offense — which features five double-digit scorers — with 11.8 points per game. She is also second on the team with 5.5 rebounds per game and is tied for the team lead in blocks with four on the season. Sophomore guard Courtney Jaco is averaging 10.5 points per game, redshirt sophomore guard Jordan Adams has 10.3, junior guard Brianna Barrett has 10.2, and Calvert is averaging 10 per game. Adams also leads the team in assists with 5.3 per game, while Barrett leads the team with 2.8 steals per game.
“I think our team has bought into the concept of spreading the ball around and really making each player an offensive threat, which is much more difficult to defend,” Cooper-Dyke said. “You have to stop the team as opposed to one player. We’re leaning on each other, relying on each other and having each other’s back on offense and defense, but we’re playing great basketball.”
The Gaels (4-1), who are coming off a 67-63 win over Iowa State, will host Cal State Northridge (6-0) before their match against the Women of Troy. Saint Mary’s, led by Lauren Nicholson’s 16.5 points per game, will counter with a balanced scoring attack of their own, with four players averaging 12 points or more per game. The Gaels are coming off of a 23-10 season and an 11-7 record in the WCC.
The only previous meeting between the two teams was a 71-55 Saint Mary’s victory last season at the Galen Center. Cassie Harberts finished with a double-double in the game (17 points, 12 rebounds) but was the only USC player to finish with double-digit points. Because Harberts has since departed for the WNBA, the Women of Troy will have to rely on another player to step up in Moraga.
“We’re going out knowing what we want to do, and execute more,” senior forward Kaneisha Horn said. “We still have a lot of work to do, we’ve just been able to get victories, and we want to continue on that path.”
After the game against Saint Mary’s, USC will spend the next month at the Galen Center. They’ll start their home-stand against Cal State Northridge (6-0) on Tuesday, Dec. 9, at 6 p.m., followed by Sacramento State (1-5) on Saturday, Dec. 14, at 2 p.m. The homestand will take them into Pac-12 play, which will begin on Tuesday, Dec. 30, at 6 p.m. against UCLA (1-4).
Quick Hits
The 2013 Gaels advanced to the second round of the Women’s NIT, while the Women of Troy fell in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
Vaioletema was named the  USC Credit Union Female Student-Athlete of the Week for her performance against SMU. She is the second basketball player to win the award this season, after Adams last week.
South Carolina, the only team to defeat the Women of Troy this season, remains the top-ranked team in the AP Poll. Stanford, Cal and Oregon State are the only ranked Pac-12 teams, at No. 8, No. 10 and No. 17, respectively.

This is by and large my favorite time of year to buy gifts for others and find incredible deals on gifts for … well … myself. I feel a little guilty admitting this, but if something is a great deal, it’s worth it, right? Do I really need that pair of J.Crew boots for half-off or that $20 shirt that they’re practically giving away? These “to buy, not to buy” decisions are time consuming and, with finals, an easy distraction from the end-of-semester stress we’re all facing.
It’s the last month of the year, which means Americans, like you and me, are shopping till we drop. The National Retail Federation projects that Americans will spend $619.9 billion from November through December. And while the economy has been improving these past few years, a report found 80 percent of nonprofits reported an increase in demand for services though 56 percent of these nonprofits were unable to meet the demand.
I’m making this the year that I give up just one item that I’ve been coveting and commit to donating a gift of the same dollar amount to my favorite nonprofit. For the past six months, I’ve been meaning to get involved with  L.A. Kitchen, but life has been nonstop. Instead of waiting, I decided to close that browser window with my online shopping cart and, instead, make a donation.
As a graduate student, time is hard to come by, and this was an easy opportunity to give up something I never needed for something filled with meaning for someone else. There’s no shortage of need in our backyard. Did you know that Los Angeles has the second largest homeless population in the United States, or how about the incredible 841 museums and art galleries in Los Angeles County?  We are awash with organizations, movements, art projects and creative human services that have projects they’re desperate to fund.
The Trojan community has long been a hub of community-based philanthropy. The Office of Civic Engagement estimates that USC dedicated an incredible $35 million in support of community initiatives last year. Let’s build on USC’s commitment to our community, and give in a way we’ve never done before. If we can be one of the thousands of fans filling the Coliseum, then nothing is stopping us from coming together to pass on our next online purchase and share that amount of money with a meaningful cause.
This idea of forgoing one purchase and making a donation to support a nonprofit to make a difference is tied into #giftchange. We’ve heard over and over that there’s power in numbers and power in doing good. But did you know that you benefit directly from being generous? Researchers discovered that the act of making a donation activates the brain’s reward center, the mesolimbic pathway, which delivers a euphoric response. There’s so much to gain from giving. Let’s not pass up this opportunity to come together, feel good and make someone else feel good, too.
As we begin to wrap up 2014 and celebrate our many holidays, I challenge you to give up one purchase and give to your favorite nonprofit instead. Tell your friends what you did (on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, wherever) and challenge at least three of them to do the same. Join the #giftchange. You never know when a little change up will go a long way. Happy holidays, fellow Trojans, and fight on!

It’s early Thursday morning at Harvard University, and students are rushing to class. In one lecture hall, a group of students take their seats, prepared to learn without distraction. While sitting down for lecture, they proceed to participate in discussion, unaware of the cameras photographing them each minute for a study by the university’s Initiative for Learning and Teaching to analyze student attendance. Social media outlets have shed light on this recent Harvard’s controversial photo invasion.
During spring 2013, the university’s Innovation for Learning and Technology set up cameras in four lecture halls to monitor 2,000 Harvard students for research on class attendance. Through a computer algorithm, the photographs from the cameras extracted information that was given to the university to review the progression of student attendance throughout the semester. The controversy emerged after computer science professor Harry R. Lewis called the study into question during a faculty meeting in early November.
After the study was conducted, the university failed to disclose the details and information regarding the study to the students and faculty who were monitored in a  timely manner. Harvard claimed that the photographs taken from the cameras were solely studied for the purpose of tracking seats, rather than linking the information to individual students. This brings to light a controversial set of issues.
Though the university failed to disclose the study in a timely manner, it was not wrong to analyze student attendance to enhance the learning experience for students. In this case, informed consent is somewhat tricky to acquire.
Though the university followed protocol by asking the Institutional Review Board for permission to conduct the study, they did not inform the students and faculty involved because obtaining consent could potentially skew the results. If those involved in the study knew the university was testing for attendance, professors would enforce a stricter attendance policy to make their classes look larger, and students would be more likely to attend lectures to adhere to their professors’ stricter attendance policies. Thus, in order for the test to collect real results, it was important for the study to be kept a secret.
Additionally, informed consent in the classroom brings to question the withdrawal of personal privacy in public space. In this modern day and age, technological gadgets are often strategically placed in public space to monitor for the security and well being of citizens. While attending lecture in a public space, an individual cannot guarantee that his or her personal rights to privacy are not being infringed upon. Whether it be through a security camera at the university or through a classmate taking a Snapchat photo of another classmate without permission, informed consent seems impractical in a number of cases.
But many individuals who have been quick to criticize Harvard are explaining the controversy in terms of a breach in security rights and an invasion of privacy. Recently, an op-ed from the Boston Globe discussed how the main basis for the controversy was the time lapse between Harvard conducting the test and informing the students and faculty about the study. Yet, the vast amount of criticism on the issue from students, faculty members and onlookers did not stem from informed consent or an ineffective time response. None of the photos taken from the study could identify individual students, and the purpose of the study was not to target specific students attending class. The photographs taken were destroyed after researchers accumulated data for the study, and no harm or foul play was done to the students.
Similarly, other universities across the nation have been known to conduct studies without consent to monitor effectiveness of learning tools and patterns in attendance and participation. According to Rebecca Koenig and Steve Kolowich at the Chronicle of  Higher Education, institutions conduct formal studies to monitor such behavior.
“Universities that are not Harvard conduct much deeper surveillance on students who take their online and blended courses,” Koenig and Kolowich write. “Some institutions track how frequently individual students participate in class and how long they spend on readings and on homework problems, along with other metrics that far exceed the capabilities of a camera taking still pictures in a lecture hall. Even traditional universities collect and analyze lots of data on students, including when and where they log into campus networks or enter campus buildings.”
In this instance, the time lapse and uninformed consent does not bring enough controversy to the issue itself. Such backlash was warranted through a deep sense of mistrust for reasons of personal privacy, and this comes from a growing feeling of fear about infringements on personal space and personal privacy.
When individuals step out of their personal space into public space, many unknowingly step into a world where their rights to privacy are at risk. Technology has opened portals that allow for constant monitoring and control over the way in which individuals interact and live. The laws that mandate censorship and privacy can disintegrate with the loopholes that exist in technology. Thus, with the amount of technology that exists today, it is impossible to guard individual rights to privacy, free from infringement.
Though frustration regarding this incident stems from fear of censorship and privacy violation, the lack of evidence linking a probable infringement of rights in this case shouldn’t have prompted such harsh backlash from many who were used in the study.
If that were the case, then Harvard wouldn’t have agreed to adjust its procedures in the future for approvals of such studies.

This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a series of major political changes: He dismissed two senior ministers from his cabinet, dissolved Parliament and called for early elections to form a new government. With elections now on the immediate horizon, Israelis have an opportunity to elect a new government that will feature new leadership and fresh faces in regional politics.
Finance Minister Yair Lapid and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni were given the boot after Netanyahu felt their opposition proved to be a liability. No significant advancements in peace talks with Palestine have been made since Netanyahu took office. In addition, the recent decision to dissolve Parliament highlights a lack of leadership –— clearly, the era of Netanyahu has come and gone.
Netanyahu has held the position of prime minister for the past five years in a country fraught with division, both internally and externally. Under Netanyahu, Israel has seen the expansion of its settlements in the West Bank, as well as flare-ups in tension and conflict with Palestinians, culminating this summer in a seven-week standoff that claimed lives of both Israelis and Palestinians.
When announcing the dismissal of top aides, Netanyahu said, “I will not tolerate any opposition in my government.” The despotic statement fails to champion any notion of democracy and resonates more as an autocratic declaration than a promulgation of elections. The coalition government currently in place has become increasingly fractious and divided on issues such as economic policy and housing. With internal conflict and an executive who is adamant about extinguishing opposition, accomplishing any comprehensive goals and progress is a tall order for the Israeli government. New elections are a fresh start for democracy, a barometer that has the capacity to gauge the will of the people and the mandate set forth for the government to follow. The era of halted negotiation and disregard for opposition voices, both domestically and internationally, must come to an end, and the Israeli people must elect a new leadership that strengthen the government and facilitate diplomacy abroad.
Netanyahu’s current term is set to expire in 2017, but with his call for early elections, his time as prime minister might be up sooner than that. With his five-party coalition crumbling under the immense division, it is evident a new government is needed. With debate heating up in recent weeks over a proposed “Jewish nation-state” law, many view the ethnic exclusivity in Israel, one compounded by Netanyahu’s actions, as a potential pitfall for the Jewish state. Marginalizing minorities and restricting self-determination to refer to Jews only is anathema to any protection of minority rights in a democratic state. A coalition government that offers no protection of minority groups and comprises of disparate parties, many of which aren’t looking for compromise, poses a formidable challenge for Israel.
Netanyahu hopes the new elections will help steer Israel in the right direction. In this ballot box, however, the right direction for Israel is one away from Bibi.
Athanasius Georgy is a sophomore majoring in biological sciences. His column, “On the World Stage,” ran Thursdays.
Looks like another Israeli government that has no long term plan and becomes more of a theocratic fascist entity that denies rights and liberties to those in the minority.
At least Whoopi Goldberg can move there anytime and become a full citizen mooching off US taxes.
So sad that the native Palestinians can’t even vote, marry, travel or have a citizenship in the Middle East’s so-called only  democracy (which isn’t true anyways)
The Yazidi in Iraq and the Christian Copts in Egypt are not
“settlers” and “occupiers;” neither are the Jews in Israel.
They are victims of a common enemy that seems to want a Middle East free of
non-Muslims.
“Netanyahu has held the position of prime minister for the past five years in a country fraught with division, both internally and externally. Under Netanyahu, Israel has seen the expansion of its settlements in the West Bank, as well as flare-ups in tension and conflict with Palestinians, culminating this summer in a seven-week standoff that claimed lives of both Israelis and Palestinians. ”
==
You write this in a fashion as if this is all Netanyahu’s fault and that the Palestinian intransigence and outrageous support for jihadists who run cars into women and children as no fault to bear.
Let’s not forget that Abu Mazen (aka The Latest Palestinian Dictator) is now serving his 11th year of a four year term.  Or that his party, Fatah, and Hamas hate each other and are essentially two distinct unrelated groups.
You pretend to be an objective journalist when it’s clear you’re just another water boy for the blood-thirsty Palestinians.
“In addition, the recent decision to dissolve Parliament highlights a lack of leadership –— clearly, the era of Netanyahu has come and gone.”
Really Athanasius?  And you’re the expert?  Last I’d heard Netanyahu was wildly popular in Israel for little things like protecting Israel from Muslim madmen.
And concerning your brilliant insights into lack of progress with the peace talks why don’t you tell us of a time when there was progress.  And don’t blame this on Israel for Israel has offered any number of concessions – yes, and this includes the current government – only to be pissed on by the dictator Abu Mazen.

When most people picture a college lecture course, they see a crowded, auditorium-style room with a professor speaking to hundreds of students. For decades, this image has represented a traditional university class, but select educators at Harvey Mudd College believe it’s time for a change.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
Professors Darryl Yong, Rachel Levy, Karl Haushalter and Nancy Lape are currently researching the effect of “flipped” classes. In these classes, students watch their professor’s lectures online, instead of in a lecture hall. They then attend discussions or group exercises closely based on the lecture material and are encouraged to email professors with any questions they have prior to discussion sections.
Though online lectures are flexible with students’ schedules, discussions ensure that students don’t forego invaluable collaboration with professors and classmates. Some discussion sections include quizzes on the online video to ensure student viewership.
If these online lectures are more effective than traditional lectures, they could be precisely the shake-up higher education needs. Technology is improving all other aspects of daily life, so why not education?
Gone are the days of jam-packed lecture halls filled with eager, attentive pupils. Instead, students frequently skip lectures, and those who do attend often do so while multitasking on their laptops — finishing other assignments, sending emails and checking social media. This produces an environment that is more study hall than lecture hall.
So far, the results from Harvey Mudd’s research seem promising. Professors tested flipped courses by splitting their classes into two groups. One group attended traditional lectures while the other watched lecture videos from the same professor online. Results of the ongoing study have shown no perceptible difference in performance between the two groups, proving that flipped classes could represent a viable replacement to traditional lectures.
These results aren’t surprising, considering the fact that most students are already learning from the Internet. Students frequently supplement, if not replace, their in-class learning with free information available to them online. SparkNotes and Wikipedia are the newest humanities professors, and Khan Academy, with over 10 million users, is the 24/7 math professor. With all of these free alternative options, universities must establish their own online educational presence or face the consequence of students tuning out professors in the classroom, only to tune in to someone else on their laptops.
As student loan debt rises and universities face increasing criticism for unaffordability, the last thing administrations want is for students to wonder if their investment is worth it. Yet, when students are paying to attend a university but learning from other sources, this is exactly the question that arises. Researchers also believe flipped classes could decrease the costs of a higher education, a definite benefit.
This combination of new technology and new options has spurred a “Space Race” of education, as schools rush to find innovative ways to compete with online learning sources. Villanova University, the University of South Florida and North Carolina State are also testing flipped courses. USC could benefit from joining this race and offering undergraduate students similar online options.
Investing more resources in utilizing technology would not only help USC remain relevant — it would help students get more out of their education.
The phrase “full-time student” is nearly obsolete, especially at USC. Though at one time attending lectures might have been students’ first and only priority, it’s a different story today. USC encourages a wide range of interests, a push toward diversity that students embrace through a broad range of activities, from sports to clubs to internships. It’s very rare to find someone who names “going to class” as their sole activity.
Flipped classes alleviate the craziness of the modern college student’s schedule by allowing students to “attend” lecture when it best fits into their schedules, instead of arranging their schedules around lecture times. And if they’re struggling with a topic, students can replay lectures as many times as they want.
Our generation is known for our attachment to instant gratification, and critics might claim that altering education so students can access lectures when they want is another example of this. But current methods aren’t set in stone, and there’s no reason not to update education in accordance with shifting technology and culture. Most would agree that our current system of higher education isn’t perfect, especially with the debates over the value of college.
The question of whether college is “worth it” simply shouldn’t be a question. Universities can combat this concern by offering students as many services as possible, and if this means flexible, online lectures, then so be it.
Even if flipped classes don’t catch on, it’s obvious that in light of available technology, shifting student priorities and the ever-present pressure to lower costs, higher education is about to undergo a major change. As a leading university, USC should be at the forefront of this shift.
