As if USC fans didn’t need any more abuse after an offseason of being dragged through a ditch on the back of a carriage drawn by horses that just ate a can of beefareeno, this comes as a preview to USC’s first game at the Coliseum this weekend:
CBSSports.com opened up an article about the USC-Virginia game by saying “this may be the least excited [USC’s] crowd has been for a home opener in quite some time.”
I’m here to disagree with that.
First, let’s take a look at some of the home openers in seasons past. In 2007, the second-best football program in a state known more for its potatoes than football (the University of Idaho) came to town, and most of the Coliseum crowd was gone by the third quarter.
Then, after Ohio State and ESPN’s College Gameday came in 2008 in what was actually an exciting matchup (at the very least the hype was exciting),  San Jose State invaded the Coliseum in 2009 only to see USC put its backups in after halftime.
So for Virginia, a mid-level ACC team, to come to USC this year is a major upgrade from two of the past three seasons. Fans can get excited that sophomore quaterback Matt Barkley, freshman tailback Dillon Baxter and senior wide reciever Ronald Johnson might actually play until the fourth quarter, and about a coach other than Pete Carroll leading the way.
Speaking of Baxter, the freshman phenom actually plays his first game this weekend thanks to a suspension by coach Lane Kiffin that held him out of last week’s game. You’re telling me that Trojan fans aren’t excited to see the most touted running back recruit since Joe McKnight or even Reggie Bush shake defenders on the field rather than on YouTube clips?
After all, the public isn’t allowed in practice anymore, which makes this team more mysterious than teams in seasons’ past. It’s like when you were a little kid going to Disneyland; you get to see your favorite characters in person for the first time. Try telling your 7-year-old self that you weren’t saying, “Are we there yet?” from the moment your car backed out of the driveway.
However, with Disney characters and USC teams during the last decade, you knew more or less what you were going to see. The exciting part about this team is that nobody really knows what it is capable of. Sure, USC won fairly comfortably at Hawai’i, but the Warriors were an anomaly, playing a spread offense the likes of which the Trojans probably won’t see again.
Is the Trojan offense led by Barkley as potent as it appeared against a weak Hawai’ian defensive team? Is the defense equally as bad as it looked against a unique Hawai’ian offensive team? Virginia will come out running a pro-style offense that the Trojans should be more accustomed to, and with some shuffling in the defensive line, the front seven has the ability to be among the best in the nation.
But that’s the thing. Everyone is undervaluing this Trojan team. For the first time in a while, USC is an underdog on the national scale. Nobody is predicting the Trojans to win the Pac-10. So instead of being set up for a big letdown, fans are set up to ride the success of the team. After all, whether you admit it or not, games are much more exciting when your team isn’t favored by 50 points.
Taking all this into account, most Trojan fans come into this home opener with a chip on their shoulder. They’ve been hearing all offseason about players transferring, high-profile recruits reneging, how their team is going to suffer with a depleted roster and how their season is a lost cause before it started just because the team can’t go to a bowl game.
Whether it’s arrogance, blind faith, extreme confidence or just foolishness, many Trojan fans will proudly point to that chip on their shoulder and predict that USC will give the NCAA a huge middle finger and defy everyone’s expectations to go 13-0 this year. That’s how excited USC fans are for this season.
So CBSSports and anyone else who thinks Trojan fans are bummed out about this home opener, come to campus at noon on Saturday, seven hours before game time, and try telling the tens of thousands of fans clad in cardinal and gold fighting for tailgating room that they aren’t excited for this home opener.

Last year, three USC teams clinched NCAA championship titles: men’s water polo, women’s water polo and men’s tennis. On Sept. 13 President Barack Obama will honor these three teams — the most from a single university — along with about 30 others from schools across the nation at the White House for their athletic and academic achievements.
Fight on · The women’s water polo team celebrated its national championship last season. As a result, the team was invited to the White House. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
Last season for these three teams was memorable to say the least.
The men’s water polo team recorded a 7-6 win over UCLA, earning back-to-back championship titles. Along with beating the Bruins, the Trojans made history with the win by becoming the first team to make five-straight appearances at the NCAA finals.
The team’s home opener is Saturday against Long Beach State, with the No. 4 Trojans looking to defeat the No. 10 49ers. Although the team has lost some crucial seniors since last year, it still hopes to make its sixth apperance at the NCAA championships this season.
The Women of Troy fared no worse last year, beating top-ranked Stanford 10-9 and earning their first NCAA championship title since 2004. The Women of Troy, led by eight All-Americans, finished the season with a record of 25-3 and their win against the Cardinal earned them their third national championship title.
The women’s title was the eighth overall national championship for coach Jovan Vavic, who also coaches the men’s team. To complement his two championships last season, Vavic won National Coach of the Year awards for both the men’s and women’s teams.
Finally, the No. 5-seeded men’s tennis team defended its national title by beating No. 2 Tennessee. Although they lost the doubles’ point, the Trojans pulled through with their singles matches and claimed victory over the Volunteers in the end.
The move to honor NCAA student athletes at this kind of reception was begun by former President George W. Bush. These athletes will not only be congratulated for their achievements on the field but off the field as well.
Other schools with multiple teams invited are Penn State, UCLA, Villanova, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and Stanford.
Maheen, this is an amazing article. Many of the others i have read written by other Daily Trojan writers are not written nearly as well. This article is both accurate and well worded, and complimented by you’re organization, which is flawless as well, as evidenced by the perfect flow of the paper.  You must be a crucial asset to this news staff and you obviously have potential in the field of journalism. i hope you continue to write for the daily trojan in the future.
Please review your choice of words. You do not clinch a national title by winning the very last game or match. Clinch is used when there is no possibility of losing with the event still in progress or games left in the season in football, basketball, and baseball.

After getting picked apart for 588 yards by Hawaii’’s run-and-shoot offense, the Trojan defense is looking forward to facing a more traditional-style offense against Virginia on Saturday.
Welcome home · Sophomore linebacker Devon Kennard said he’s excited to show the fans at the Coliseum this weekend what the team has been working on since its last game ­­— most notably tackling and blanket defensive coverage. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
The Cavaliers employ a pro-style offense led by bruising running back Keith Payne. The 6-foot-3, 255-pound senior will provide a much different look for a Trojan defense that often found itself chasing down quicker, smaller opponents in Honolulu.
“I think you’re going to see a much different game,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I will be shocked if we don’t play extremely well on Saturday on defense.”
Simulating Payne’s speed and size in practice is another issue however. Redshirt freshman fullback Hunter Simmons, who is 6-foot-3 and 235 pounds, played the role of Payne at practice Wednesday.
“He wasn’t quite as fast, the defense wasn’t quite as impressed by him, but Hunter tried,” Kiffin said.
The Trojan defense, which was chasing receivers all over the field last week, considers this weekend an opportunity to redeem itself. All the better that the chance will come against a physical, powerful team.
“Now that’s exciting,” said sophomore linebacker Devon Kennard. “I’m excited for this game, [to] get to some football, to more [of] what we’ve been doing all spring and all fall.”
Payne, along with Virginia running back Perry Jones, will not only provide a greater physical challenge but will also test the Trojans’ tackling ability. USC did not tackle well against Hawai’i and continues to prohibit tackling in practice in hopes of preventing injuries.
Senior linebacker Malcolm Smith expects that the familiarity with Viriginia’s traditional offense will help the defense stop Payne.
“He’s a big, tough runner,” Smith said. “We’ve just gotta make sure we tackle this week and just play physical. We get an opportunity to do a lot of stuff we’ve worked on throughout the spring and fall camp.”
And after giving up 36 points in its debut, the Trojan defense feels it has something to prove.
“We definitely have a chip on our shoulders,” Kennard said. “There were points when we played really good and points where we need to improve.”
u
Redshirt sophomore defensive end Nick Perry remained limited at practice Wednesday because of a high ankle sprain and he is still questionable for Saturday’s game. Perry missed the season opener because of the injury.
Kiffin described Perry, a 2009 Freshman All-American, as a potential top-15 NFL pick based on his physical attributes. At 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds, Perry has a 34-inch vertical leap and is as fast as most of USC’s defensive backs in short spurts.
“There’s probably only 10, 15 people like him in the world,” Kiffin said.
USC’s defensive line managed three sacks against the Warriors, but did not get to Hawai’i quarterback Bryant Moniz often enough. Perry gives the Trojans another weapon.
“He appears to be better off than he was last week so I hope he plays,” Kiffin said.
u
Wednesday was sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley’s 20th birthday. In the Pete Carroll years, that might have been cause for some kind of celebration.
Not under Kiffin.
“We need to win some games first,” Kiffin said. “We’ll worry about birthdays later.”
Kiffin was then asked how many wins it would take for him to start acknowledging birthdays.
“A lot more than one,” he replied.
Dear Josh,
     What happened to the Trojans defensive line? It seems they were asleep on the job. And, furthermore it doesn’t  look like the same the Trojans I knew when they won the Emerald Bowl last year at AT&T Park.

The Andrus Volunteers of Gerontology Center held a garage sale fundraiser Wednesday morning to raise money for students in the USC Davis School of Gerontology.
Workers at the Andrus volunteer center brought various items to sell at low prices, said Linda Broder, coordinator at the center. Overall, the event raised about $500.
The money will go toward funding goody bags for gerontology students. The goody bags are given out during the weeks of final exams.
“We have a variety of different treats in there,” Broder said. “We’ll prepare them and in two days they disappear.”
The fundraiser is held about every other year, Broder said. In the past, the money has gone into a scholarship endowment fund and  toward free lunches for the students.
“It goes in some ways to benefit the students,” Broder said.
The sale, held in the Cedar Courtyard of the Andrus Gerontology Center, featured items such as a vintage camera, picture frames, jewelry, a Schwinn bicycle, headphones and more.
“It was pretty well sold out,” Broder said.

With Blackboard reaching its 11th year at USC, a team of evaluators has been assembled to assess the benefits and flaws of the program for students and faculty.
As of spring 2010, 78 percent of USC faculty and 86 percent of students had at least one class listed on Blackboard. Fifty-two percent of all USC classes use Blackboard for grading, content or class-wide communication, according to Susan Metros, deputy chief information officer for Technology Enhanced Learning and chair of the Blackboard committee.
Nine different focus groups, made up of students, professors and administrators, plan to evaluate Blackboard using individualized rubrics that suit the needs of each group’s members.
The rubric, Metros said, allows students and faculty to discuss their particular needs in order to improve USC’s learning management system for the better.
Metros said she hopes to work with the library to coordinate the Blackboard system. E-reserves would possibly give students an even greater access to online articles and sources.
Another idea, Metros said, is allowing professors to post content into a general folder that any student in any of their classes can easily access.
“The rubric system is a very unique way to do this,” Metros said.
On the administrative side, Blackboard aims to expand its product so that it would have some features of a social networking group.
In the future it could include ways of tracking activities throughout a student’s time at a university, letting students put together a portfolio to save course work online or allowing advisers and other people within the university to keep online files.
“Even though Blackboard aims to enhance [its] product, we don’t know if USC would go in that direction with them,” said Gene Bickers, vice provost for Undergraduate Programs. “In five years we could also have a completely different learning management system.”
Although the Blackboard system was revamped a few years ago, the program is still due for an evaluation since it has been at USC for 11 years, Metros said.
“What’s convenient for faculty is not always the best choice for students and the other way around,” Bickers said.
Although the university will probably not change the Blackboard system any time soon, Bickers said, the university does need to go through these timely evaluations to adjust its software.
Blackboard originally came into use in 1999 when USC administrators hoped to shift from using different systems for grading, content and communication to one succinct program.
Although there were many options, faculty decided on Blackboard as USC’s core learning management system.
“For the last two years, previous Provost [and now President C.L.] Max Nikias asked faculty to have Blackboard sites in case of emergency,” Metros said. “This provides some semblance of teaching just in case students can not get to campus.”
“Blackboard makes it convenient to have everything for your classes gathered online — you don’t have to keep track of so many papers and it’s great for organizational purposes,” Bickers said. “It’s also an easy way to keep track of grades throughout the semester.”
Students, such as Danya Nourafshan, a junior majoring in psychology, said they appreciated the perks of Blackboard and use it regularly for various purposes.
“It’s great to be able to send class e-mails for questions or concerns and have extra copies of important class documents online,” Nourafshan said.

The total amount of outstanding student loan debt has exceeded the total national credit card debt for the first time in history, as the figure nears $850 billion in both federal and private loans.
Helping hand · The USC Financial Aid Office, located in John Hubbard Hall, has seen a slight uptick in the number of aid applications. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
As the costs of attending college continue to rise, need-based financial aid grants have not been able to keep pace, forcing students to turn to these loans as a source of financial aid and driving up the total amount of debt in student loans.
Approximately 60 percent of USC students receive some form of financial aid, with most of those financial aid packages including student loans.
According to Patrick Moore, senior associate director of loans in the USC Department of Financial Aid, there has recently been a slight upward trend in the number of students applying for financial aid, but the demonstrated need of those students remains relatively consistent from year to year.
The federal government declared the Federal Direct Loan Program as the only government-sponsored loan program in the country in July. Under the direct loan program, schools provide loans to students with funds that originate directly from the United States Treasury.
This program replaces the previous Federal Family Education Loan Program, in which private banks and credit unions acted as the source of capital for student loans. These private lenders would make federally guaranteed loans to students, but the source of the money itself was not the National Treasury.
“Schools draw down money from the Treasury Department and the loans are owned and serviced by the Department of Education,” Moore said. “The federal government is the direct source of the funds for the program, rather than going through the banks and credit unions as a middle man.”
With the tumultuous financial climate in recent years, several banks opted to back out of the Federal Family Education Loan Program, prompting the federal government to step in and provide a more stable funding source.
“In the past we had to rely on banks to develop the money and in this last year, because of difficulties in national credit markets, the federal government ended up purchasing many of the loans,” Moore said. “What the Federal Direct Loan Program does is create a flow of funds that is not going to be interrupted or threatened by changes in national capital markets.”
The new loan program also gives students lower interest rates on some loans in comparison to the old program, saving students money in the long process of repayment. By consolidating the source of the loans, it is also easier for students to manage repayment options and rates.
Yet, some students still feel the burden of loans and their accruing interest as every school year brings along more debt.
“I’m definitely worried about loans building up. The way it’s looking now is it’ll be like 10,000 per year, so 40,000 by the time I graduate,” said Omar Gonzales, a freshman majoring in business administration. “It’s kind of a scary thought.”
USC offers several different repayment plans for students, ranging from 10 to 25 years to fully repay the loans. For students of lower income, there are plans that can be adjusted based on gross monthly income and family size.
In addition, loan forgiveness programs exist through the Federal Direct Loan Program to relieve students of their payments under various circumstances, including volunteer work, military service or public service.
Students can also utilize the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program that waives the balance of student loans for government or private non-profit employees who have made payments on their student loans for at least 10 years.
However, the daily stress of money spent still worries some students.
“It does sit in the back of my mind, as far as the fact that I’m spending money that I have to pay back. It’s not money I actually have in my pocket, so I think I will be a little more cautious as far as how and what I spend it on,” said Hesam Akbari, a junior majoring in business administration.
“I’m kind of in a situation where I have to pull the loans out,” Akbari said. “Whatever interest rate they give me, they give me. I don’t really have an option.”

Alpha Delta Chi, known as USC’s Christian sorority, has officially been welcomed into the Panhellenic Council as an associate sorority.
Sisterhood · Known as the Christian sorority, Alpha Delta Chi has joined the Panhellenic Council as an associate member. The ADChi house is located on 29th Street. - James Watson | Daily Trojan 
For the first time during fall rush, Panhellenic included ADChi in the official brochure to potential new members and recruitment counselors referred to the 11 — not 10 — sororities.
Rebekah Stokes, president of ADChi, has already noticed an advantage to being associated with Panhellenic, as the sorority’s responses for rush have increased “double or triple from last year.”
“When I was a freshman and sophomore a lot of people would think I said ADPi or ask what [ADChi] is,” Stokes said.  “Now I’m hearing people say, ‘That’s so cool, I’ve heard of you guys.’”
Though ADChi is now considered an associate member of Panhellenic, it did not participate in formal recruitment.
“The membership requirement of our house is technically discriminatory because a girl who does not identify as Christian cannot be in our house,” said Emily Camin, ADChi’s social vice president.  “We don’t want to turn people away, but girls who aren’t Christian probably won’t want to come to our house anyway so formal recruitment doesn’t even make sense.”
According to Stokes, ADChi is a sorority that exists for spiritual growth and development, academic excellence and Christian fellowship for students at USC.
“Our biggest spiritual growth is between bigs and littles. Ours is more of a discipleship program, someone to look up to and respect and help you find where your priorities lie,” Stokes said.
Though ADChi members bring a spiritual element to their sorority, Stokes said they have social activities as well.
“You always have a sister there to pray for you before your big test, and our house is fairly close to campus so we have movie-watching parties and other events,” Stokes said. “We provide positive options for people to build relationships in a way that they will remember the next day, but still have a great time.”
With only 32 members so far, ADChi has not received much attention in past years, but some members believe the new association with Panhellenic will enable the sorority to have a larger presence on campus.
“Without the status it was a little harder to get our names out there and get involved,” Camin said. “Now we have exposure to other Greek events going on and even greater contacts.”
Some members like Paige Gartland, a junior majoring in psychology, were hesitant at first to accept the new connection with Panhellenic.
“At first I wasn’t so excited because I didn’t want to be seen as the stereotypical sorority girl, but as I was talking to other girls I realized it will give us more of an opportunity to reach out to the sororities and [fraternities],” Gartland said.
Stokes said that her goal is to have ADChi become involved with Homecoming, a prominent USC football tradition in which the Greek community participants.
“We haven’t signed up for [Homecoming] or anything, but even just to be able to watch it for a year to know what to do next year will be great,” Stokes said. “I just want to be there to observe and make sure girls who will lead next year understand what’s involved with Homecoming.”
Recruitment for ADChi begins Sept. 13.  
At least you know upfront they don’t put out.  I appreciate the honesty as my time is valuable.

Though the University Gateway’s Yogurtland remains an empty shell, you can put down your fists of fury and walk down to the shopping center at 27th and Figueroa streets. Forget the Yogurtland fix — a new frozen yogurt champ has rolled into town and its name is Tutti Frutti.
Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan
Appearances are deceiving. From the outside, Tutti Frutti Frozen Yogurt — which opened just three months ago — looks like any other Pinkberry-ripoff fro-yo joint. But take a cheerfully offered sample cup and you will find that Tutti Frutti thrashes most of the pink and green-hued competition.
In self-serve fashion, Tutti Frutti has six yogurt pumps. You pick a cup size and choose your flavor combos. It might be a hard choice but you can’t really go wrong.
Tutti Frutti has a standard tart flavor, three or four fruity flavors and one or two creamy flavors.
The standouts among the fruit flavors are the pineapple, mango and strawberry. Those with a sweet tooth should not bypass the fruit for the chocolate — Tutti Frutti’s fruit flavors are its best component. The pineapple is clean and fresh, while the mango is sweet and tangy but without the sour “mango with the peel” taste that corrupts the yogurt flavor. Also swell, the strawberry lacks any of that synthetic “strawberry candy” taste.
Ultimately, Tutti Frutti hits a delicious spot with its creamy and fresh yogurts. Many frozen yogurts, lacking fat, have an icy mouth feel. Though Tutti Frutti’s yogurts are fat free, they are genuinely creamy — especially the chocolate and taro flavors.
The ultimate surprise was in fact the taro flavor. Taro — a potato — can taste strange in frozen yogurt form. Tutti Frutti’s taro, however, tastes like cake batter. It is sweet and creamy, but without the cloying sugar-fest of many actual cake batter flavors.
The only disappointing flavor of the gamut was the pistachio, which brought to mind pistachio Jell-O more so than pistachios.
Tutti Frutti changes its flavors every two weeks, and will introduce more flavors in the months to come. Cheesecake and espresso are on the imminent horizon. Meanwhile, Tutti Frutti also serves all-fruit smoothies in flavors such as kiwi and strawberry.
Once you have picked your yogurts (the taro-strawberry-chocolate combo is a luscious trifecta), you can add your mix-ins. They are pretty standard — fruit, nuts, candy, cheesecake and brownie pieces, sauces, cereal and sprinkles. Tutti Frutti has a few uncommon mix-ins, such as lychees, but does not go for red bean paste-levels of exotic. If you just want a Cap’n Crunch fix, you will be in good hands.
When you arrive at the register, nibbling away at the Fruity Pebbles that dust your frozen masterpiece, expect a sweet surprise. Tutti Frutti charges 35 cents per ounce, making it comparable to Yogurtland. However, Tutti Frutti does not charge for the cup. It also offers a 10 percent student discount, as well as a punch card so you can work your way toward a free yogurt. A modest-sized serving of yogurt with some toppings could easily keep you under the $3 mark — a dang fine price for a tasty dessert.
You might be feeling like you have heard the name Tutti Frutti before. Chances are, you have. Tutti Frutti is actually an international chain that has recently began a 150-store expansion across the United States.
Located right by South Figueroa and 30th streets, Tutti Frutti is well-situated for anyone living along Figueroa Street and is worth the hike for those in farther abodes. Yogurtland should be opening soon, but do not forget Tutti Frutti. Whether you want to spite Gateway or just want some good yogurt, Tutti Frutti is a great place for your fro-yo fix.

On a vinyl record, the side labeled “B” traditionally contains the music that didn’t quite make the cut for side “A” —  the music that, unfortunately, has been overlooked and ignored by countless listeners over the years. The seven girls that make up Side B Magazine’s editorial team, however, are determined to change the side B misconception and show readers that simply because someone’s creative work is not as well-known does not mean it is of lesser quality than its mainstream counterpart.
Unknown · The first issue of Side B Magazine featured works of poetry and prose as well as photography from undiscovered artists. - Photo courtesy of Side B Magazine  
To prove this point, Side B Magazine asks for submissions from writers, poets, artists, photographers and musicians, some of which will be chosen and showcased in the quarterly magazine.
“Our mission statement is very simple,” said Christina Piña, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television and the magazine’s managing editor. “We are hoping to nurture artists who are too old to dabble, but too young to have their voices heard.”
In accordance with its mission, Side B Magazine primarily features work by people between the ages of 18 and 30. Although the editors are not opposed to publishing work by people under the age of 18, they try to keep the featured artists under 30.
“We feel like if you’re 30 and you haven’t been discovered yet, we love you, but it’s different,” Piña said. “But if you’re 16 years old and you feel like you can read and connect with the poems, then perfect — that’s exactly what we’re looking for.”
The first issue came out in August, but the magazine is still very much a work in progress, Piña said. She works with six other editors located across the country to select and edit the work that will be featured and published in Side B.
“We want artists who love their passion, who have this niche in their life and want to share it with people,” she said.
Nidya Sarria, the magazine’s editor-in-chief, originally started the magazine as a high school junior in Florida, but it only lasted for a short time. Now a junior majoring in English at Princeton University, Sarria decided to start up the magazine once again — this time on a national level.
“There was definitely a literary scene at Princeton, but I felt like a lot of people were writing the same things,” Sarria said.
After getting Piña, who Sarria knew previously, on board, she used online forums to recruit the rest of the editors: Fiona Kyle, Tia Mansouri, Brittney Brown, Kate Fisher and Nikki Birdwell. Because they are located in different places, they primarily communicate via Facebook and e-mail.
“I don’t feel it’s very different from working with a staff that’s in the same place,” Sarria said. “I guess that’s just the nature of the 21st century — a lot of things happen through e-mail.”
Along with the magazine’s print edition, which is produced four times per year, Side B’s editors also blog daily. Since it is more difficult to include some artistic mediums, such as music and film, in the print publication, the editors use the blog to showcase young individuals with talent in these areas. At 43 pages long, the first issue of the print publication focused primarily on poetry and prose with a strong emphasis on photography.
Julie Gallup, a senior majoring in art education at The College of New Jersey, had multiple photos published in Side B’s inaugural issue, one of which made the magazine’s cover.
“I was really surprised when they told me it was going to be on the cover,” Gallup said. “I’m just starting out as a photographer and I’d like to freelance eventually, so having that kind of exposure early on is really inspiring me to do more work.”
Gallup’s experience with Side B represents the magazine’s goal: to inspire and encourage young artists who might otherwise have had no means of sharing their art.
“It would be nice to be part of making people’s careers from the ground up,” Sarria said. “One day they will be established and we’re all just helping people along to get to that place.”
As Side B grows and evolves, Sarria said she hopes that more influential people will see the magazine and make something of it.
“The whole idea was to become part of a movement of young artists,” she said. “It’s definitely aiming high, definitely dreaming big, but I just hope we get to the place where we’re relatively well-known and doing good work.”

Most people drive through life unaffected by red-light cameras. But have you ever thought about how influential and powerful they can be? You run the red light, the camera flashes, you think, “Oh god” and say a quick prayer, but two weeks later the ticket comes in the mail along with photographic proof of your violation. You pay the godforsaken ticket and move on with your life. You can’t cry your way out of it, or apologize and claim that you were late for church. The picture proves the driver broke the law. It’s the camera’s job. Hate the game, not the player.
But what about the passengers? They weren’t breaking the law — they were innocent bystanders. Don’t they have the right to remain out of the incident entirely? The driver broke the law, so therefore his right to privacy is temporarily suspended for the purpose of law enforcement.
In my WRIT340 class, which focuses on legal writing, we discussed an incident in 2004 where an unsuspecting husband received a ticket in the mail. When he looked at the picture he realized that a strange man was sitting in the passenger seat next to his lawfully wedded wife. A traffic violation cost the woman a ticket for more than $300 and her marriage — her husband filed for divorce.
But what about the poor guy she had the affair with? Maybe he had no idea she was married. The camera exposed his identity and his location, causing an entire problem that had nothing to do with running the red light. He didn’t break the law.
What do you think about these silly cameras now?
In my class, we concluded that as technology gets more and more advanced, we give up more and more of our right to privacy.
In 1890, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis published “The Right to Privacy” in the Harvard Law Review. The 11-page essay examines how photographs infringe upon one’s right to privacy. In 1890 the camera was new technology and its ability to expose people in a photograph was a scary thought.
Today cameras don’t phase many people. I don’t think about who is going to look through my album on Facebook, nor do I care. I don’t alter my behavior in a building with security cameras. Until my class had a discussion about it, I had never thought about how much I am exposed via security cameras, Facebook photos or otherwise. Now that is a scary thought: Being seen by the eye of the camera is natural for me.
Yet when I start to think about it, the exposure brought on by the constant flow of images might be natural but I don’t necessarily want to be exposed. But is it too late to opt out of things that might compromise my right to privacy, such as my cell phone or my computer? I couldn’t survive without either, so I give up my privacy in exchange for the ability to communicate. Is that a fair trade?
Take text messaging for instance. When you send a text, no matter what it says, you give up all control over it. Even though you and your thoughts created the text, you no longer have rights over it.  Whoever you send it to has the power to show other people, save it, delete it, copy and paste it elsewhere, etc. Do you think about this when you send a text, or think about how often you share others’ texts with your friends? The only way to remain in control is to not send text messages. The same goes for e-mail and other mediums through which you control your own exposure.
But forms of personal exposure can occur that are beyond your control, such as the red-light incident. I reiterate myself: Shouldn’t our right to privacy protect us from unwanted exposure — despite advances in technology?
Rebecca Lett is a junior majoring in print journalism and economics. Her column, “Staying Connected,” runs Thursdays. 
Most people are defenseless against an invasion of their privacy, because it most often comes under the color of authority.  Here’s a couple examples that are relevant to this article.  
Part of the budget haggling going on right now in Sacramento is the governor’s proposal to put up 500 cameras to issue speeding tickets by mail. The fines would help balance the budget. If this scares you, phone the governor’s office at 916 445-2841.
Then there’s Snitch Tickets, the fake/phishing red light camera tickets sent out by the police in an effort to fool the registered owner into giving up the ID of the actual driver of the car. (He doesn’t have to!) Local cities using this “social engineering” tactic are Bakersfield, Corona, Garden Grove, Gardena, Hawthorne, Inglewood, Laguna Woods, Los Alamitos, Loma Linda, Riverside, Santa Ana, Santa Clarita, South Gate, and Victorville.) Snitch tickets have not been filed with the court, so they don’t say “Notice to Appear,” don’t have the court’s address and phone # on them, and usually say, on the back (in small letters), “Do not contact the court about this notice.” Since they have not been filed with the court, they have zero legal weight. You can ignore a Snitch Ticket. If in doubt, Google the term.

Part of The Thermals’ draw has always been their ability to craft quick-paced, simple, energetic and infectious pop/punk/indie/rock songs. On the band’s latest album, Personal Life, things are different. With Personal Life, for instance, the lyrics fit with the title of the album. Although previous albums were filled with political or religious commentary, most of the lyrics on the album describe universal pains and struggles, particularly in relationships.
Fresh off the studio · The new album’s conglomeration of familiar and novel sounds signals a changing stylistic direction for the band. - Photo courtesy of Motormouth Media 
Another crucial, yet occasionally detrimental, change in the band’s sound is its energy level. The band’s earlier albums, such as its debut More Parts Per Million, consisted almost entirely of loud, short and fast lo-fi rock songs. Although some songs on Personal Life — such as the first single “I Don’t Believe You” ­— capture that energy, many of the songs on the album are slow-building, mid-tempo tracks. Granted, The Thermals have always experimented with slower songs, but the songs on Personal Life seem exceptionally lacking in energy.
“I’m Gonna Change Your Life,” the mid-tempo opener, sets the pace for the album with simple, building guitars and drums and straightforward lyrics such as I want to know your feelings / I want to know your shame / I want to know your secrets / I want to know your name. The song continues to build but ultimately fails to explode with the fast-paced energy the band is known for.
The next track and the album’s first single, “I Don’t Believe You,” is more reminiscent of the band’s earliest work, with its driving guitars, pounding drums and energetic “Oh-A-Oh” chants.
“Your Love is So Strong” is yet another more typical Thermals track. The guitars and bass are loud and distorted with plenty more of the band’s signature “Oh-A-Oh” singalongs included between brutally honest and emotional lyrics such as You’re all that I need / Your love is so strong.
The rest of the album, however, is much more subdued. Songs such as “Never Listen To Me” bring the album down, both in quality and energy. Like many of The Thermals’ other work, the song is simple and the lyrics are straightforward yet captivating. The quick-paced music and high energy that the band that initially made the band popular, however, are almost completely nonexistent.
One of the album’s best songs, though, is the similarly laid back and mid-tempo “Power Lies.” This time, vocalist Hutch Harris’ loud singing and touching lyrics stand out, as they do in other Thermals’ songs. Though a relatively slow track, Harris’ readily apparent emotion and pain greatly enhance the song as he yells lyrics such as How did I lose my past / How did I choose this path / Power lies / And takes back what you take in time. Without Harris’ unique voice and powerful lyrics, this song and many others on the album would sound dull and weak.
The album, however, also has its instrumental high points. “A Reflection” includes an unusually complex guitar riff that builds throughout the song before eventually decaying into a chaotic frenzy of feedback. The overpowering bass, dark acoustic guitars and occasional snare hits on “Alone, A Fool” also provide an interesting contrast to the rest of the album.
Although Personal Life begins with “I’m Gonna Change Your Life,” it ends, cleverly, with “You Changed My Life.” The songs between are simple yet powerful tracks that accurately describe life’s various obstacles. Despite the slower pace of Personal Life, the essence of The Thermals’ intriguing sound is still present. This style, which consists largely of emotional shouting over distorted, simple guitar riffs, doesn’t always work with the slower songs of the album, but Personal Life is still a good first step in a new direction for the band.

The City of Angels is known for fame, fortune and picturesque weather. However, Los Angeles also has a dark side, one full of crime and murder. To shed light on one part of this darkness, one bus tour strives to expose the seedy underpinnings of some of Los Angeles’ finest sites.
Katrina MacGregor and Marisa Lorion | Daily Trojan
The Black Dahlia is one of the most iconic murders in L.A. history. On Jan. 15, 1947, the body of aspiring actress Elizabeth Short was found in a vacant lot in Downtown Los Angeles. To this day, her murderer is unknown and Short’s story lives on in the eponymous legend, so named because of Short’s jet black hair, black attire and black, Goth-like makeup.
Short’s story still lingers in the minds of those who live in the Los Angeles area, where it has become a staple in crime history because of its violent nature and lack of resolution — all aspects which are addressed in the Real Black Dahlia Crime Bus Tour, put on by Esotouric.
“We see this notorious, poorly understood and often misrepresented crime story as an opportunity to take people deep into the real life experience of the lost and lonely women of post-World War II Los Angeles,” said Kim Cooper, an Esotouric representative.
Not only does this tour explore the last moments of Short’s life, but it helps give a better understanding of the women who came to Los Angeles during World War II to seek fame and stardom.
“Our favorite passengers for this tour are women who were young in 1947 Los Angeles, who come with their daughter or granddaughter, because they always have stories to share about what it was like in L.A. then,” Cooper said.
The tour goes beyond the murder aspect of the story and hones in on Short’s character. During on the tour, passengers and tour guides interact with one another and talk about who Short really was and who they think killed her.
The tour begins at the Biltmore Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles, where Short checked her bags after arriving at the Greyhound station and continues to the Olive Street Bar where it is believed Short met her murderer. While traveling through Downtown, the tour explores other sites including the Examiner offices and the Figueroa Hotel, where Short had also stayed. The tour nears its end at Leimert Park, the formerly vacant lot, where Short’s body was discovered in one of the city’s most memorably horrific crime scenes — her body was found in pieces, drained of all blood.
The tour’s unusual nature and grisly eye for detail has made it one of the most famous crime tours in Los Angeles.
“It is honest, immersive, emotional and real,” Cooper said. “It surprises people who think they already knew it all about this case.”
One of the most interesting parts of the tour is the stop immediately following the dumpsite: the house of Dr. Walter Bayley. Bayley wasn’t immediately a key suspect in the case, but was thought to be the killer by Los Angeles Times reporter Larry Harnisch. In recent years, Bayley has emerged as one of the stronger suspects — but he died a year after Short was murdered.
The Real Black Dahlia tour is one of Esotouric’s most popular, drawing a wide range of passengers keen to learn more about Los Angeles history. These same people will try to create their own solutions to the ongoing mystery of the Black Dahlia.
“Our aim — and I think we succeed — is to change the way people think about this case and about the city in 1947,” Cooper said. “It’s an experience that leaves people thinking.”
The mystery of the Black Dahlia will always haunt Los Angeles. Tourists can become active participants in an ongoing crime investigation that has stumped police and forensic specialists for more than 50 years.
The Black Dahlia is a Los Angeles icon and this tour is a new way to see the secret, unexposed, murky side of the city.
For those wishing to explore the darkness, you might have to wait. Tickets for the next tour on Sept. 25 have sold out, but are available again in January.

When it comes to the crapshoot of selecting courses we know nothing about, we often choose ones with flashy titles or notable professors. There was one class that immediately caught my eye: a leadership course taught by the university president.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
As if he weren’t busy enough during his 19 years at the helm of a prestigious, drastically changing university, former President Steven B. Sample and acclaimed colleague Warren Bennis taught The Art and Adventure of Leadership to 40 juniors and seniors every spring semester.
Here’s the catch; you had to be among 40 upperclassmen selected out of a pool of about 160 students who applied for this course.
In his book The Contrarian’s Guide to Leadership, Sample described the course as involving “seminar settings … no-holds-barred discussions … and thorough individual study.” By analyzing their respective leadership abilities, meeting prominent leaders in the community and studying the styles of history’s most celebrated leaders, students’ horizons were broadened, to say the least. This course offered a curriculum unmatched by most others, and it should not fade away simply because Sample has stepped down.
This class should not only continue at USC under President C.L. Max Nikias, but applications among upperclassmen should also skyrocket — from all majors. There are numerous benefits to taking a course of this caliber, some more obvious than others.
From a lecture standpoint, a student couldn’t ask for a better opportunity than to actively listen to a university president speak about the art of leadership. Our current president is a proven leader through practice, experience and intellectual study. For students to say they were able to take a course that involved listening to their scholastic president discuss his or her challenges, experiences and triumphs is rare in a university setting. Although that alone would prompt students to sit in the front row during class, it’s still only a fraction of what students experience in this rigorous course.
The Art and Adventure of Leadership was and should be much more than just a lecture. The one-on-one contact with the president in small group settings provides select students with the unique ability to engage in roundtable discussion. The point of such a course isn’t merely to view leadership styles, but to challenge students’ — and administrators’ — concepts of leadership.
Questioning a university president? Again, such opportunities are rare. USC’s leaders and students are setting the stage for a semester of thought-provoking discussion and resolution of major campus, community and national issues.
Some might contest that this course doesn’t meet the standards of a typical class. In fact, it was more similar to an extended guest lecture. So why make a whole course out of it?
This complaint only addresses the superficial aspects of this class. Sample writes in his book that “These students examine the lives and careers of 20 historical leaders, from King David … to Martin Luther King … They read over 1,000 pages of text … write a dozen four-page papers and complete a major group project.”
Ultimately, this course is more than just soft leadership talk. It is marked by intense study, debate and analysis of leadership of past, present and future generations.
Whatever paths students are on or whatever careers they pursue, this course could provide a fresh insight about the often-misconstrued concept of leadership and challenge students to reach beyond preconceived notions of what classifies a leader today.
“Teaching this course has been one of the most satisfying academic experiences of my career,” Sample wrote. He isn’t alone; chances are his students feel the same way.
Students and administrators alike should ensure that this course continues. Who knows — we could be sitting down for one-on-one discussions with President Nikias in the spring. Although that might sound unusual for many universities, we just call it the Trojan Family.
 Stephen Zelezny is a sophomore majoring in public relations. His column, “USC on the Move,” runs Thursdays.
I never got the chance to take this class, but I agree that it would be a shame to see it die. I am a member of Delta Omicron Zeta, USC’s leadership fraternity, which was born as the final project for MDA 365 two years ago. DOZ has been one of the greatest and most fulfilling experiences during my time at USC, and it would not have existed had it not been for this class.
Like I said, I never took the class, but I can imagine that if my analysis of leadership as a whole and my own leadership abilities through DOZ — an extension of the class, if you will — has been so critical to my self-development, then MDA 365 must surely be worth keeping around!

Bill Gates might be one of the world’s most renowned college dropouts, but he had quite a bold statement to make about the future of college education last month. At the Technonomy 2010 conference held in Lake Tahoe, Gates expressed his vision about how learning will evolve over the next few years:
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
“Five years from now on the web for free you’ll be able to find the best lectures in the world. It will be better than any single university. College … needs to be less place-based.”
His argument is two-fold. According to Gates, universities have become far too expensive for most people to afford, so it’s difficult to achieve an upper-level education in the first place. Moreover, he believes that textbooks, especially in the Western Hemisphere, are too intimidating for students.
What Gates said makes sense. I’m sure most of us can understand and agree with his contentions about the overwhelming cost of college, as well as the information overload that we experience as students.
Moreover, although USC does not offer many online lectures, there is no doubt that online learning has recently garnered immense popularity throughout the country. According to the 2009 Sloan Survey of Online Learning, the number of students taking at least one online course rose 17 percent from 2007-2008.
Still, I can’t help but contend that Gates was wrong when he said online learning should take the lead in enlightening the next generation’s youth. In order to grow into the kind of people we want to be, we need a setting to explore our options — a space that fosters academic, social, intellectual and personal growth.
There might be a few ambitious, driven and exceptionally well-socialized self-learners for whom the Internet could be a viable educational alternative. But most students need to be nurtured. We need an environment to influence and to be influenced by.
For one, social interaction with groups of diverse individuals facilitates personal growth. Strong bonds can form during 3 a.m. study sessions at Leavey Library, a meal at Everybody’s Kitchen or even at a party on The Row — not to mention the valuable experiences students go through and the relationships they build via campus clubs and organizations. Unlike place-based learning in colleges and universities, online learning can’t provide any of those.
In addition, there is a common sense of community, passion and school spirit that runs through college students — and we Trojans know this better than anyone else. From swaddling Tommy Trojan in duct tape to prevent UCLA pranksters from defacing the statue, to gathering at the campus center in a sea of Cardinal and Gold to watch the football game together, the sense of energy and excitement we derive from our campus cannot be replicated at any other university — least of all one that exists only online.
Research has also shown that the greater a student’s involvement in college, the greater will be the amount of personal development. According to Alexander Astin’s Theory of Involvement, a developmental theory for higher education, “The effectiveness of any educational policy or practice is directly related to the capacity of that policy or practice to increase student involvement.”
If Astin’s contention is true, online education can be rendered close to ineffective given its inability to provide a large number of opportunities for student involvement.
It truly would be a shame if Gates was right and college campuses became obsolete in the next five years. I understand the benefits of online learning, but I strongly believe in the value of place-based colleges. Yes, we can create dynamic, edifying and enlightening experiences online, but we can’t replace the human element of college.
Amrita Parekh is junior majoring in communication and psychology.
 
Gates may be right about online education when it comes to job training for the average person, but he is wrong about the purpose of a university education.  A person goes to a university to become a better educated and well-informed citizen.  Why else would he or she study the humanities or social sciences?  Certainly not for the job prospects, that’s for sure.  Another person earns an online degree to learn a trade.  Never the two shall meet.

According to the Heisman Trophy Trust, a recent report made by Yahoo! Sports, which stated that the trust had decided to strip Reggie Bush of his 2005 Heisman Trophy, is false.
“The status of the USC/Bush matter remains unchanged. Any reports to the contrary are inaccurate,”  Trust President William J. Dockery told ESPN.
While USC’s athletic department has returned its copy of Bush’s Heisman and made an effort to remove all traces of the athlete from the school, Bush himself still has his copy of the trophy.
Bush allegedly accepted lavish benefits from outside sports agents during his years playing football for USC, and was thus recently deemed ineligible for the 2005 season by the NCAA. USC was also cited for “lack of institutional control” and put on probation for four years, suspended from bowl games for two years and received a reduction in football scholarships.
The Heisman Trophy Trust has met informally to discuss the Reggie Bush situation, but has not made a formal decision regarding the fate of his Heisman. If the Trophy Trust were to take away Bush’s Heisman Trophy, he would be the first winner to be stripped of the award in all 75 years of the Trophy’s history.
No date has been set for the official announcement on the matter.
great article- Bush deserves to keep his heisman!

The Tuesday after labor marks the day that the Los Angeles Unified School would usually begin the school year, but budget issues this year have pushed that date back to Sept. 13.
Members of the Service Employees International Union protested outside Virgil Junior High in Los Angeles Wednesday morning to protest the school furloughs. Teachers and staff are unpaid on cut school days.
Students will return to the classroom a week later, as part of an effort to reduce costs incurred by the second-largest school system in the nation. The district is currently facing a budget deficit of $640 million.
Some high schools began school early in an effort to prepare students for state testing in May. These schools include Arleta, Sun Valley and Polytechnic high schools.

Mondays are traditionally treated with dread: the weekend comes to an end and the start to a new week of classes and stress begins. But this Monday, Sept. 13, girls (and a few unwilling-to-admit-it guys) will make their way across campus at the end of the day with renewed optimism. At 9 p.m., they will shed their qualms and settle down in their living room, bed, or stand outside a electronic store TV display  to watch the season premiere of Gossip Girl.
Although the last season ended with some undesirable twists – one of the main characters was shot, a supporting character left the show, a favored couple broke up – the thinning plot line is not enough to deter avid Gossip Girl fans. Regardless of what has happened or may happen in the future (the season premiere is promised to reveal the previously injured character in Paris with a new woman, because even a gunshot wound isn’t enough to hold Chuck Bass back from womanizing), the qualities we love about the show are sure to remain consistent.
Expensive fashion, glamorous parties, and over-the-top drama will continue to spice up future Mondays.
For a sneak peek at the premiere and to watch full episodes, visit: www.cwtv.com/shows/gossip-girl

Google unveiled a new instant search feature Wednesday that searches a user’s query one letter at a time as you type, and does so faster than before.
The new search feature shows results as they are being typed into the query box. If users scroll down to a word or phrase, they can generally determine if they are searching for the right thing.
Users of the browsers Chrome, Firefox, Safari for Mac or Internet Explorer will be able to use this new search feature, which is heavily reliant on JavaScript to make it run faster. Google’s online FAQ claims that the new search feature will save “2-5 seconds per search.”
Google instant can be turned off and filter against lewd, profane or hate speech in its searches.
As a company, Google is known for its constant web innovation, with some of its most innovative features — such as Google Shopping (or Froogal) and Google Voice — emerging from its programmers’ un-structured time.

The Undergraduate Student Government announced updates to its new sustainability mug program at Tuesday’s Senate meeting.
The program is a collaborative effort of the USC Libraries, USC Hospitality and USG to promote campus-wide sustainability.
Students will soon be able to purchase mugs from various hospitality venues, such as Trojan Grounds or the campus center, and will receive 10 percent off all drinks on campus.
“It really is a campaign to be more sustainable on campus … it’s just one more step,” said Tim Sae Koo, USG director of student affairs. “[USG’s] job now is to help market it and spread the word to the students.”
Hospitality will choose between two styles of mugs Wednesday, both of which are appealing and still affordable for students, Sae Koo said. A student from the USG Program Board will then design the graphic for the mug.
The mugs are anticipated to be available by next semester. They are designed to be spill-proof and have already been approved by USC Libraries and Hospitality. Students will be allowed to bring mugs purchased through this program into all libraries.
The sustainability mug project was proposed a few years ago; however, Sae Koo said the biggest obstacle in completing the project was poor communication between the departments around campus.
“It’s a long process, so that’s why all we have are rough estimates in terms of dates,” Sae Koo said. “I’m just really excited about it now because it’s been a project that has been going on for a couple of years now.”
Sae Koo said USG put a lot of effort into pushing for the program and that the USC departments are finally seeing the benefits of a sustainability program.

When a festival bases its namesake, lineup and motto on the idea of compiling the strangest amalgamation of music possible, delivery is defined by splitting a bill between an Oscar-nominated heartthrob, New Orleans’ funk-rap rising stars and an elementary-age Abraham Lincoln.
Los Angeles’ FYF Fest (the FYF used to stand for F-ck Yeah Fest) describes itself as “a mix tape of bands that would never play with one another.” The seventh year of the festival would have fulfilled this promise simply by putting Ryan Gosling’s folk/baroque group, Dead Man’s Bones (featuring the Silverlake Conservatory of Music Children’s Choir dressed as deceased historical figures) and New Orleans’ Big Freedia on the same stage in the Los Angeles State Historic Park. Instead, they went about 10 steps further, adding San Diego lo-fi scuzzball Wavves, L.A. favorites Local Natives and many more to a diverse cast of rappers, rockers, folksters and other performers.
A modest crowd of sunglasse-clad early birds beat the long lines and caught the first acts to play: mostly local groups well-known to and beloved by L.A. scenesters. Abe Vigoda, The Growlers and Warpaint, although familiar, all turned out typically decent sets, though none were especially remarkable. As the sun beat harder, the bands got better. Vetiver, a San Francisco quintet, played a lackadaisical, quietly playful show. It was the first band to gain noticeable interest from the growing crowds.
As the heat became considerably less bearable, so did patience for the buzz bands that occupied the middle of the billing. Though lead singer Nathan Williams’ antics soured much of the blog-heavy goodwill toward his earlier work, Wavves has been back in the limelight because of the improved studio sound of its third album. Live, however, the baby-brat antics, along with the poor scuzz-rock sound, made for a boring, insincere performance. Ariel Pink, also riding the positive buzz of a cleaned-up studio album, played a similarly faked-raucous vibe.
The more-established headliners and the dependable festival regulars were an admirable cleanup crew, dispelling the negativity of the disappointing bands that preceded them. Local Natives, a last-minute addition to the top of the bill, was predictably poised in front of the large, pulsing crowd in front of the breezy, grassy area near the Redwood Stage. On the same stage, Ryan Gosling’s not-just-a-side-project horror-themed Dead Man’s Bones was a very pleasant surprise earning more than one “Hey, he’s actually pretty good” from fairly tough customers.
Doom-metal outfit Sleep did its thing admirably, an act audience members call “shredding.” Animal Collective frontman Noah Lennox’s solo act Panda Bear closed the show, also just doing what he does — something along the lines of intense, guitar-deconstruction with dreamy lyrics. It was great for what it was, a meandering cool-down from a long, hot, exciting day. Still, it was nowhere near as exciting as the festival’s highlight, courtesy of the unparalleled folk-rockers Mountain Goats.
The trio, led by singer-songwriter John Darnielle, has a “If you hold it, we will come” festival philosophy, and every single set is unique and thrilling. The wry stage banter is unmatched (“If and when you get divorced, you’ll remember this song. When you think of divorce, think of the Mountain Goats”), and the impassioned delivery eclipsed the blasé bologna of Wavves and Ariel Pink.
The well-cast top billers were the stars of the show, and besides a couple sourpuss snark-rockers, the rest of the lineup was, as promised, highly satisfying and uncommonly diverse. The downside, the real drag on the whole shebang, was the poor planning for what was sure to be a crowded, popular and important show for the people in charge.
A terribly offensive dust cloud plagued the pit of the first stage, named the Oak Stage. Fans emerged from this mess covered head to toe in dust, with a fair share of it in their mouths, eyes and eyes. Some fans seemed to enjoy the chaos, but others were coughing and spitting and sneezing up dirty, brown mucus that is certainly better out than in, however visually off-putting. The obvious health concerns this miniature rock ‘n’ roll dustbowl posed, as well as the desire not to be coated in an inch-thick layer of earth, were potential deterrents to fans coveting a front row spot for their favorite artist’s performance.
The dusty nebula surrounding the Oak Stage perhaps wasn’t entirely avoidable — it comes with the middle-of-a-barren-field territory. However, glaring hiccups abounded at the festival. Outside food and drink were not allowed inside of the festival (two sandwiches prepared by this writer’s own hands fell victim to a thorough bag search), and the overpriced food trucks and stands were plagued by long lines and the jacked-up prices. OK, many festivals (not all), turn away sack-lunchers and rob blind everybody willing to pay, but most of those festivals grant some access to water. Somehow, in planning an increasingly popular festival in the middle of Los Angeles, near the peak of summer heat, someone thought that one drinking fountain would be enough to prevent dehydration. The apparently ruthless planners had $4 water bottles on-site for anyone not willing to wait in the two-hour-plus line for the fountain (though, the stands hawking H20 were often sold out). Point is, you can charge $10 for a crummy burger, you can take $8 for terrible beer, but you just can’t dehydrate people.
That being said, the FYF Fest folks never promised a thought-out setup. They promised great, disparate tunes and in this regard, they delivered. From out-there, funk-fueled hip-hop to buzzy indie-pop, all the way to ear-blasting doom-metal, FYF Fest really had something for everyone. This is the festival to keep tabs on in the future. Once somebody gets the logistics down pat, well, they’ll definitely need more than a few more drinking fountains.
This was a terrible festival that just happened to have some great bands. As stoked as I was about the lineup though, the miserable aspects of the day made me realize that I’d rather pay $25 to see 2 or 3 of these acts in a decent venue than a shamefully organized mess like FYF. Considering this is their 7th year, I don’t expect the thing to improve and unless The Knife plays a one-off show here next September, I don’t plan on giving Sean Carlson and Co. any more of my money.
That being said, Delorean and Titus Andronicus were excellent.

The USC football team enjoyed a win sprinkled with some sun in Hawaii last weekend, but it was back to work Tuesday as the team worked to sort out problems that arose Thursday, mostly on the defensive side of the ball.
Coach Lane Kiffin immediately tinkered with the lineup, moving junior defensive end Armond Armstead inside to defensive tackle to open up space for redshirt sophomore Nick Perry at defensive end. Perry didn’t play against Hawai’i because a high ankle sprain, but he was out on the field Tuesday practicing with the first unit.
“Nick looked good. His ankle is fine. It’s still bothering him a little bit, but he said it’s a lot better than it was last week,” Armstead said.
Armstead also met with defensive line coach Ed Orgeron yesterday, who told him that he felt more comfortable with the junior on the inside of the line. Armstead said he has wanted to play there since he came to USC, and Orgeron and Kiffin hope this move will solidify the defensive line.
“We’re going to make sure we are looking at the right guys and getting our rotation down,” Kiffin said. “Obviously we’re not pleased with the way our defensive line played, especially with our backups, so we’ve got to make sure we’re playing with the right guys.”
—
The Trojans are continuing their non-tackling ways at practice this week even though the defense missed many tackles against Hawai’i.
Kiffin said he’s addressing the problem by having players work on tackling in individual drills, but stressed that because of a thin depth chart, staying healthy is the first priority.
“We’re not going to change the way we practice. It’s too valuable to stay healthy to have our frontline guys out there,” Kiffin said. “Even though we have issues tackling I like looking at our injury report going into this week seeing that all our front line guys will be available for our home opener.”
Sophomore safety Jawanza Starling said there’s one way the defense could solve that issue.
“You can’t just think that once somebody hits him he’s going down,” Starling said. “You got to gang tackle, get everybody to the football and just run and sprint to the football.”

Saturday’s game against Virginia is the first game for the new-look Trojans at home this season, but it’s also the much-anticipated first game for freshman running back Dillon Baxter.
Baxter didn’t travel with the team to Hawaii because he violated team rules. He said he learned his lesson and that sitting at home watching the game on television was the worst experience he had in football since his mother took his trophies away from him when he was 7 for doing poorly on a science test.
Baxter was back at practice Tuesday and Kiffin said the most important thing for him on Saturday will be to protect the ball.
“First concern always with freshmen is taking hits,” Kiffin said. “Especially him because he hasn’t been hit in practice. So most importantly take care of the ball and see what he can do from there.”
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley didn’t hold himself back when talking about what Baxter will add to the offense.
“It’s going to be huge. Just another tool in my toolbelt,” Barkley said. “He’s going to be great whether we use him as a quarterback, running back or just as a receiver. He can do all three. He’s going to be a huge weapon for us.”
—
Junior cornerback T.J. Bryant was back on the field yesterday. Bryant has been out all fall camp since senior fullback Stanley Havili broke his cheekbone in a skirmish earlier in the summer. Bryant played in all 13 games last year and brings some needed experience to the secondary.
“T.J. was full participation today out there — moved around, did some things. It’s good to have him back and in the mix,” Kiffin said.

The Chevron gas station located at Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard shuts off its gas pumps today in preparation for the building of a new housing development.
Last call · Students will no longer be able to visit the Chevron gas station on Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard after today. A luxury housing unit, offering retail shops and 56 apartments, will replace the lot next to the Radisson Hotel. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
The Icon Plaza, a six-story complex, will replace the gas station and offer luxury living amenities, such as a 24-hour concierge, spa and pool, in addition to laundry, maid and room services.
“We know that there’s some projects now, like University Gateway, so we want to have some shops that are complementary to the existing retail there,” said Billy Ruvelson, principal of The Icon Company. “Whatever retail we have will be community serving and whatever stuff is in demand by ’SC students and faculty.”
Ruvelson said the Icon Plaza will have “competitive pricing” with other housing in the area.
The 100,000 square-foot building will host several retail shops on the ground floor and 56 apartments. The the complex’s exterior will mimic other USC buildings.
“The design will be harmonious with the surrounding buildings. It’ll be architecturally interesting and respectful of the USC buildings surrounding it,” Ruvelson said.
The housing unit will provide up to 250 more beds for USC students.
“I think it’s a good thing that they’re adding housing because it’s expensive to live close to campus — that’s why I drive a few miles every day to get here,” said Julie Zhu, a senior majoring in economics.
The company building the housing development, Forward Progress Management Estate, Inc., controls several other apartments in the Los Angeles area, and is also developing three more properties for other colleges: two at UC Santa Barbara and one at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
“It’s a private company which will offer its own leases for housing students,” said Kristina Raspe, USC associate senior vice president for real estate and asset management.
Yet some students are unhappy with plans for the housing structure and will need to find an alternate station for gas.
“This is the closest gas station to USC,” said Gabrielle Lopez, a junior majoring in communication and a frequent customer of the station. “People are going to have to drive super far to get gas now, and there are other places that you could go build housing. I’m pissed off that they chose to do it here.”
Some Chevron employees said the current workers will probably be transferred nearby, to either the Chevron at Figueroa Street and Washington Boulevard or the station at Figueroa Street and Martin Luther King Boulevard.
The employees also said students come to the station often.
“I use this station every two to three days. It’s the only gas station I use really,” said Alex Uvimolchai, a junior majoring in business. “I pump gas here, fill my tires, buy some food in the mart. It’s very useful to have nearby.”
The Icon Company expects a timeline to be developed in the next month for construction of the 23,000 square-foot lot.
Seriously, there are definitely like 4 gas stations within 2 miles.The one at Vermont and Expo is like 30 feet farther away from the campus than the Fig/Expo one. And it’s much closer to where the majority of students live anyway. I say full speed ahead for more Transit-Oriented Development. What I want to know is when is construction supposed to begin?
big news, usc students travel .5 miles more for gas, get angry
There’s a gas station at Hoover and 24th, one at Vermont and Adams, and a couple others as mentioned before.  In fact, those stations are CHEAPER than the Chevron on Fig.  Anyone who only goes to that gas station has literally not stepped more than 2 blocks outside of USC
And who goes to the gas station every 2 to 3 days??
There’s a gas station on Fig and Adams.  Also one at Vermont and Expo.
Hopefully they put another Starbucks down there (we desperately need another one, the Hoover one is always out the door) and a Pinkberry!

The No. 10 USC women’s volleyball team (6-0) recorded three impressive victories last weekend en route to winning the Hawaiian Airlines Wahine Volleyball Classic in Honolulu.
Rising up · Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter earned the tournament MVP honor after strong performances in each of USC’s three victories. - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan 
Outside hitter Alex Jupiter, setter Kendall Bateman and middle blocker Lauren Williams, all juniors, led the Women of Troy and were named to the all-tournament team. Jupiter was also named the tournament’s Most Valuable Player.
USC’s marquee win came Sunday night, when the Women of Troy exacted their revenge on No. 4 Hawai’i, who eliminated them in the NCAA tournament last year.
Alex Jupiter led USC with 22 kills and 16 digs, as USC won in 5 sets by scores of 23-25, 25-22, 25-17, 18-25 and 15-7, respectively.
The Women of Troy took a 4-0 lead early in the first set, but Hawai’i battled back. The Rainbow Wahine used a 6-0 run to take a 17-15 lead and didn’t let up. Down 24-23, USC had a chance to tie it, but freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana’s spike found the net and the set went to Hawai’i.
After dropping the first set, USC dominated the next two to jump out to a 2-1 lead. Needing to win the set to extend the match, Hawai’i began the fourth frame on a roll, jumping to a 9-3 lead. The Women of Troy tried to mount a comeback, but a block on Jupiter kept USC at bay. Later, junior outside hitter Kanani Danielson nailed an ace in the back left corner to close out the set for Hawai’i and tie the match at two.
In the decisive set, USC found its rhythm early and took a 6-1 lead on a spike by Williams. After a timeout was called by Hawai’i, the Women of Troy used a 7-3 run to close out the match and secure the upset.
“I am extremely pleased,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We went into Hawaii, played after a five-hour trip, and beat three good teams including one in front of 8,000 people in their own backyard.”
On Friday and Saturday, USC swept New Mexico and Michigan State, respectively.
Williams keyed the 25-19, 25-19, 25-20 victory against New Mexico on Friday night, recording 12 kills, a career-high five assists and five blocks.
The Lobos took a 6-2 lead in the first set, but the Women of Troy used an ace from Jupiter to ignite a run and take an 8-6 lead. With the score 20-18, Jupiter once again took charge and recorded a kill that led to a 5-1 stretch that gave USC the first set. Down 8-5 in the second set, USC capitalized on a bevy of Lobo errors to take a 19-16 lead. Eventually, Jupiter’s block would secure the second set for USC. In the third set, USC jumped out to a 9-3 lead and never looked back as it completed the sweep.
Against Michigan State, Jupiter led the team with 17 kills and six blocks, while Fonoimoana contributed 10 kills to aid the 25-17, 25-23, 25-15 victory. Throughout the first and second sets, USC used a combination of well-placed kills and blocks to take a 2-0 lead. Early in the third frame, the Women of Troy overpowered the Spartans and took a 12-6 lead; after a Michigan State timeout, USC continued its skillful play and recorded its second sweep of the weekend.
At this juncture, Haley seemed pleased with his team’s play.
“We are starting to mature. Our freshman have great potential and our juniors are starting to be responsible,” Haley said. “We had five freshman in the games at various times, and they all did well.”
With a challenging conference schedule on the horizon, the tournament victory is a confidence boost.
“No question the team will be more confident heading forward,” Haley said. “This just reassures what we have been preaching. We have an awfully good team. If we keep practicing and competing hard, we could be really good by the end of November.”
[…] Women of Troy continue undefeated run | Daily Trojan Alex Jupiter led USC with 22 kills and 16 digs, as USC won in 5 sets by scores of 23-25 25-22, 25-17, 18-25 and 15-7, respectively. The Women of Troy took a 4-0 lead early in the first set, but Hawai'i battled back. The Rainbow Wahine used a 6-0 run to take a lead and didn't let up.   At first glance, the presence of an 18-plus on-campus bar at a school that has a zero-tolerance underage drinking policy seems contradictory. Yet Traditions Bar . […]

Hi. My name is Dave and I love cupcakes.
(This is the interactive part of the column, where you collectively and cheerfully reply “Welcome, Dave.”)
OK, so there might not be such a thing as Cupcakes Anonymous, but if there were, I would be without a doubt one of its cornerstone members.
One look at my teddy bear-esque figure and it’s not hard to tell there isn’t a cupcake I wouldn’t turn down.
From Sprinkles Cupcakes to Delilah Bakery to Crumbs Bake Shop, this city’s delectable pastry supply will show no ill effects of this current economic recession, as long as I am around to feed the cash registers.
But just as I was about to deem myself a complete cupcake savant, I was stunned by what landed on my plate Thursday night — a game so rich in unimportance that even my robust appetite found itself completely unsatisfied.
No. 16 USC’s head-scratching, roller-coaster marathon of a win over the Hawai’i Warriors was the equivalent of a 21st century college football cupcake.
It was the kind of game that creeps up in early September, goes under the radar beneath the excitement and giddiness of a new season, and leaves you knowing exactly the same amount about your team as you knew before kickoff.
Inferior universities — both in terms of funding and athletic success — will tell you these are the kind of games that pave the way for a year of fiscal growth.
Why else would an unproven program like Florida A&M be so inclined to take a 45-point beating at the hands of No. 13 Miami? What motivation does San Jose State have in scheduling season openers against USC last year and the reigning national champion Alabama Crimson Tide this year?
The answer is that the cupcake tastes a whole lot sweeter on the other side of the table. Think Cuba Gooding Jr. in Jerry Macguire: “Show me the money.”
Although these immensely painful mismatches might provide some needy institutions with a few extra bucks in their back pockets, they offer up about as much substance as an episode of the new 90210.
They’re bare with intriguing subplots, reek of traditional powerhouses taking an early reprieve from the rigors of a challenging campaign, and, from an aesthetics point of view, is just bad football to watch.
Sadly, the worst offenders this year are your USC Trojans.
You can dress it up any way you’d like. A nice trip to Hawaii, followed up by a home opener against a youthful ACC team, wrapped up in a bow with a trip to an up-and-coming Big Ten school. Call it an opportunity for a young Trojan team to get its feet wet in non-conference play.
I call it a team with nothing to prove, wasting away the first quarter of its schedule against opponents that are, to be blunt, second-rate and yawn-inducing.
Sure, it was encouraging to see sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley carve up a defense that looked eerily similar to that of the one portrayed in the timeless classic The Little Giants, to the tune of 258 yards and five touchdowns (one-third of the total touchdowns he amassed in 2009).
I won’t refute that senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson flashed shades of former Trojan pass-catching legends Keyshawn Johnson and Steve Smith during his four trips to the end zone, albeit against a secondary with as many holes as a Keanu Reeves acting performance.
And I can’t disagree that USC’s defense looked as callous and out of place as a New Jersey housewife entering a black-tie affair. Allowing 588 yards against any team, Pop Warner or otherwise, is atrocious to say the least.
But with all of that said, throw out your Heisman watch and your witty rants saved up for the next time you hit the water cooler and want to rag on the Trojans’ defensive deficiencies because sadly, for the next three weeks, neither the good nor the bad holds any bearing on how this season will ultimately be defined.
This cupcake we are collectively holding in our hands is simply dry and unsettling — and that’s putting it mildly.
Thank the scheduling gods, who appear not to be starring in this act as soothsayers, or the former athletic director, who will not be mentioned at risk that he will tarnish this column’s few shreds of sanctity.
Label me a cynic, but this season’s opening month has an uncomfortable feel to it, for reasons that stray far from bowl eligibility and scholarship reduction.
My apologies for calling on history that predates most if not all of the students at this university, but USC football has long been notorious for scheduling some of the toughest non-conference games in the country.
In the 1970s, John McKay’s teams went toe-to-toe with Bear Bryant and the Alabama Crimson Tide on multiple occasions, and then proceeded to play traditional stalwarts like Arkansas, LSU and Iowa in the same year.
In the 1980s, early season showdowns against Florida, Tennessee and Oklahoma weren’t thought to be unnecessary threats on the road to a national championship. No, these games were welcomed celebrations of the best and brightest programs the sport had to offer.
Now those matchups are but a fleeting memory.
In an era where conference realignment and the grossly out-of-touch BCS bowl system garner most of the headlines, the sport has sadly become a shell of what it once was largely because of teams feeling as if they are walking on egg shells if they agree to play staunch non-conference challengers.
These days, if you can get a September slugfest between top-20 teams, fans strike a deer-in-the-headlights look, as if they just saw Haley’s Comet for the first time in 75 years.
And that’s a very troubling concept for someone who believes that when the season begins the competition should actually matter.
If this is a startling notion to you, that the game against Virginia you are set to watch with your peers at the Coliseum this Saturday is nothing short of a farce or glorified preseason game, then I am sincerely sorry.
Point your finger at the parties listed above: the former AD, the BCS system and the smaller universities who want to get their piece of the pie.
I recognize that having a home-and-home with Ohio State the last two years was a treat of treats. But greed is not what is driving my insistence that this university continue to schedule prime time billing-type games.
This program is too big of a powerhouse — with or without sanctions — to sacrifice and demean the level of excellence which it has achieved over the last half-century with the non-enticing group of opponents it has put together in 2010.
It is the ultimate lose-lose for this crop of young talent. Beat Hawai’i by only 13 points, and there is bound to be uproar and malcontent. Beat them by 40 or 50 points, and people will accuse coach Lane Kiffin and his staff of purposely running up the score on the defenseless, soon to be conference cellar-dwellers.
No disrespect to the Warriors, Cavaliers and Golden Gophers, but world champions you are not.
Part of me should be content in knowing that our student body’s passion for the game isn’t getting completely compromised by having teams like Samford, Eastern Illinois or Georgia State take on the Trojans. But from where I am looking, it’s pretty close.
For all my moaning and whining, I will devote a single line of credit to athletic director Pat Haden on scheduling a home-and-home with Texas in 2017 and 2018.
But I am not stepping down from my shabby, cardboard box on this issue.
Is it really asking a lot to let a guy have his substantial cupcake and eat it too?
At the rate we’re headed, the counter to my seemingly simple request looks more and more like a resounding “No.”

Again… after last night’s game- USC may want some more cupcakes… and Virginia is still bowl eligible.
Virginia is a preseason game? They are a young, upcoming team who is part of a BCS conference.  i hope that is the attitude that your Trojans have on the field tonight- because Virginia can at least attend a bowl game this year and next.  Go Hoos!
Perhaps the sugar has gone to your head…traditional stalwarts like Iowa?  LSU?  While LSU is a respectable team with a history, perhaps a closer look would reveal that they a tough team at home and on par with many of our other OCC opponents.  Give it up, you are on a rant and should look harder for a subject.
Virginia has fielded some pretty respectable teams and Minn has been representing the Big 10 pretty well. HI is a trip west and has always been looked upon as such.
So, I guess if I have 75 years of history to look back on I can come up with a really tough OOC schedule. I was a student during the Alabama home and home, when we shared the NC.  Those were really special teams, this one is not.
Take a look around. One of the facts I am especially proud of is that SC has never played a FCS school.  There are, by the way, on 2 BCS schools who can make such a claim.
So, Mr. Cupcake, look harder for a topic for next weeks assignment.

For the past year, most students living north of the University Park Campus have become accustomed to seeing the “yellow jacket” security personnel on their walks to and from campus.
Security · Lupe, a CSC officer on Adams Boulevard, patrols the area north of the University Park Campus, where many students live. - Nicollson Fernandes | Daily Trojan 
The Contemporary Services Corporation security officers have become a permanent fixture in the USC community, reducing the fear of crime and putting students and community members at ease, said Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
Thus far, students, community members and especially parents have given the university positive feedback for initiating this security program, Carlisle said.
“So far, since we’ve had [CSC] in partnership it has been very successful,” he said.
Though the trend of crime in the USC neighborhood has gone down during the past four years, this additional security resource often deters criminals from committing crimes when they see the officers, Carlisle said.
“The CSC officers are particularly effective in reducing the fear of crime,” he said.
According to Carlisle, the university made a decision to bring the CSC security officers to USC last year to provide an additional layer of security, especially for the majority of students who live off campus.
“We wanted a deployment strategy intended to decrease the areas without public safety presence,” Carlisle said.
Though DPS is always patrolling the area, it is impossible for  DPS officers to witness every attempted crime, Carlisle said. By working in partnership with CSC, DPS can effectively minimize the potential for crime.
Although the CSC security officers are unarmed and cannot detain criminals, they are directed to inform DPS immediately if they see any suspicious behavior. DPS then steps in and apprehends the suspect if necessary.
The CSC officers patrol the areas from Jefferson to Adams boulevards north of campus.
Gilbert Zenon, an employee at the Los Angeles branch of the CSC, said the main goal of these security officers is to observe and report.
“Our guys are out there as a deterrent,” he said.
Zenon said the officers have witnessed people attempting to steal bikes or purses. In one instance, a CSC officer even stopped a student from being robbed on the street.
Zenon said that over the last year there have not been many criminal instances in which the CSC officers have had to get involved.
“We think we’re getting better and better with more experience,” he said.
Zenon said he hopes students feel more secure seeing the CSC officers in the area.
“We just want to make a positive impact,” he said.
Students said they appreciate seing the CSC officers when they are walking home from campus.
Melissa Wong, a junior majoring in business administration, said she is glad to see them off campus at night.
“I really feel safer when they’re around,” she said.
Wong also said that she would like to continue to see them patrolling the area.
Devin Altschul, a sophomore majoring in print journalism, said her parents appreciated their presence around campus.
“Knowing that they’re there makes me feel more secure and more safe,” she said. “When my parents come to visit, they feel safe knowing that there are people close to me watching over me.”

After a weekend in the Lone Star State, the Women of Troy squared off against two more out-of-state opponents, No. 18 UNC Greensboro and Purdue, at the Under Armour Invitational in Fullerton, Calif.
In their first game against a ranked opponent this year, the Women of Troy (1-1-2) played to a scoreless tie against UNC Greensboro (3-0-1).
“We weren’t worried about their ranking and we don’t worry about those types of things,” associate head coach Harold Warren said. “I think we did well enough to win the game, but we overcame a lot of things. It’s early in the season, so we’ll be fine.”
For most of the game, the Women of Troy controlled possession, but Greensboro goalkeeper Kelsey Kearney made a few of key saves that denied them from taking the lead.
The teams played two scoreless overtimes, and though the Women of Troy had three opportunities to score in the second frame, they  couldn’t find the back of the net.
“We came out a little slow, but we started to pick it up a bit,” Warren said. “We created plenty of opportunities to win the game, but we just got to work on finishing.”
Freshman goalkeeper Shelby Church recorded her second shutout of the season, while the backline for the Women of Troy held the UNC Greensboro offense scoreless for the first time this year.
In the second game of the tournament, the Women of Troy (2-1-2) scored early and never looked back as they notched a 1-0 victory over the Purdue Boilermakers (3-2-1).
“It was a good team effort and we came out, defended hard, attacked hard and we converted on our chances that were necessary to put the game away,” senior defender Karter Haug said.
It was Haug who set up the only goal of the game as she placed the ball off a free kick for senior forward Megan Ohai, who headed it over Purdue goalkeeper Carianne Betts for the score.
The goal was the 15th of Ohai’s career, placing the forward on USC’s all-time top 10 scoring list.
The Women of Troy had multiple opportunities to add to their lead as they kept the pressure on the Boilermaker defense all day long. Betts stayed busy in goal, stopping five shots on net that kept the Women of Troy stuck at a one-goal advantage.
But, in the end, Ohai’s goal would be the difference in this game.
Church recorded her third shutout of the season and again, the USC defense held strong in shutting down the Purdue offense.
“We like to think of our defense as the entire team because we want to defend as an entire unit,” Ohai said. “Defensively, we have Haug in the back holding it down for us with [junior defender Claire Schloemer], and they’ve done a great job of leading us. As a team, we did a great job on the defensive end.”

The No. 4 USC men’s water polo team has maintained its swagger throughout the offseason.
The Trojans opened their season by outscoring opponents 53-5 in a one-sided shootout this weekend at the UCI Invitational in Irvine, Calif. Eighteen different Trojans scored in the two-day blowout, eight of whom recorded hat tricks, while seven freshmen found the net in their first collegiate appearances.
Stiff arm · Junior goalie Joel Dennerley anchors the defense as USC eyes another national championship. Dennerley got more rest time than usual this weekend as landslide matches gave reserves time in the pool. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
“The tournament went really well,” said redshirt sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal. “We played a couple of Division III teams that weren’t quite as strong, but it was a good way to start the season off. It was good to get our momentum going and set the tone for the rest of the season.”
The two-time defending national champions got the ball rolling early Saturday with a 23-3 bashing of Redlands, racing to an 11-3 halftime lead and shutting out the Bulldogs in the second half. Rosenthal led all scorers with four goals, and redshirt freshman driver Stephen Siri tacked on three more in his first match as a Trojan. Freshman driver Tobias Preuss and freshman utility Mace Rapsey followed suit with two goals apiece, while drivers Nikola Vavic and Rex Butler rounded out scoring for the freshman class.
“The freshmen this year have been doing really well so far,” Rosenthal said. “We lost a lot of guys last year to graduation, and these guys are definitely coming in and filling those roles and contributing already.”
The floundering Bulldog defense was underplayed only by an uninspired offensive unit that managed just three goals in four quarters of play, thanks in large part to Will Simon’s work in net. The redshirt sophomore goalie stepped in for junior Joey Dennerley at the half and racked up four saves to secure a second-half shutout, while USC added nine goals at the other end in the final period.
The Trojans were no more sympathetic with Whittier on Sunday, blasting the Poets with 30 goals in USC’s most lopsided victory in over 15 years. Redshirt sophomore goalie Jimmy Friedrich and Dennerley allowed just one goal apiece while freshmen two-meters Jeremy Davie and Max Hurst-Mendoza, along with Rapsey and Vavic, each earned a hat trick in their first NCAA appearances.
“We started out okay, maybe a little slow,” said redshirt sophomore two-meter Zayne Belal. “But by the end of the tournament, we picked it up and figured stuff out. We gelled a lot better.”
A young Trojan lineup did it’s best to silence any questions about the team’s seeming inexperience after losing eight seniors from last year’s national championship squad. Despite listing just five upperclassmen on the roster and no seniors, the Trojans played a disciplined tournament, improving on last year’s defensive average of 5.5 goals allowed per game while pounding the opponent’s cages with all the earnest excitement of a first collegiate match.
And although the team’s experience might have dipped this year, their goals certainly have not.
“Our expectations have never changed,” Rosenthal said. “Every year we expect to win, this year’s no different. We know we’re a young team, but we have a lot of other strengths.”
The Trojans, who open the season 2-0 for the 16th consecutive season, start regular season play against Long Beach State Saturday in McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
“It’s going to be a brawl,” Belal said. “We got in a little bit of a scuffle with them at the scrimmage the other day. I don’t think they like us too much. It’s going to be fun.”
