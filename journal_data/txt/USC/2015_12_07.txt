I thought I could smell the roses. It has been too long since I have come across that beautiful scent. Looks like Trojan fans will have to wait another year for a Rose Bowl berth, or even something greater. The Trojans finished the regular season at a disappointing 8-5, but it could have been a lot worse. I believe it is time to call this season and wash and focus on next season. That seems to be Coach Clay Helton’s mindset as well as he has already fired multiple coaches, keeping only Tee Martin, Marques Tuiasosopo, Peter Sirmon, Johnny Nansen, and Ivan Lewis for next year’s staff. Key positions such as defensive and offensive coordinator have yet to be filled. Some Trojans are clamoring for Coach Clancy Pendergast back for the defense. Others want a new face that will bring relentless aggression full of the blitzing that Justin Wilcox failed to show on a consistent basis. For the offensive coordinator position I want someone who brings a hard-nose run-first offense. I want us to get as close to the west coast offense utilizing the slants, crossing routes, and middle of the field just as we used to. We now have a very talented wide receiver class coming in for 2016, assuming the recruits stay the course. Expect the likes of Tyler Vaughns, Josh Imatorbhebhe, and Michael Pittman to make a splash next year. But that is another article that may or may not be written! Now let’s focus on the whooping we took at the hands of Stanford on Saturday.
Grades:
Quarterbacks: B
Running Backs: A-
It is a great sign to see our running backs having so much success. Justin Davis kicked it into a whole different gear toward the end of the season. Coach Helton’s confidence seems to have transcended into Davis’s play. If he continues this type of running, expect a breakout season next year; a consistent season. One that Davis has lacked since he came to USC. Ronald Jones II showed flashes of brilliance as well. The two-headed monster next year will be something to watch out for. If we can establish these two backs, we can have our version of thunder and lightning. Except it’s more like a reliable Ford and a Tesla.
Wide Receivers: B
JuJu Smith-Schuster is an incredible player, but he can’t let his emotions get the best of him in big games. He plays out of character when he lets the opposing team get under his skin. If he can utilize it as motivation and not frustration, he could hit another level that opposing teams won’t want to face. I really enjoyed the use of Steven Mitchell on the short slant passes. We need to utilize his speed more if we want to get the most out of his skill set. Darreus Rogers has become more of a consistent target and his hands will be a tremendous asset next year.
Offensive Line: B-
It really wasn’t that bad. Nico Falah continued his solid performance on the offensive line as fourth string center. However, Falah missed one key block that swung the momentum of the game as Stanford sacked Kessler and scooped and scored. It was bound to happen. However, that shouldn’t take away from the fact that Kessler has had decent time the past couple weeks. The running backs also continue to find holes thanks to the impressive pulls of offensive guards like Damien Mama and even the center Falah.
Defensive Line: D
This was the first line of defense against the Wild Caff (Christian McCaffrey). Needless to say our troops couldn’t handle the tank that was McCaffrey. Well, he was more like an all-purpose vehicle that shredded anything our defense through at him. We needed the performance of a lifetime and the offensive line just manhandled our line all game. Granted, I think Stanford gets away with a lot of holding calls. That doesn’t take away from the fact that they just outperformed us in every sense. Kevin Hogan didn’t start throwing until the second half, but there was absolutely no pressure on him on crucial downs. A largely inconsistent performance from a group that has bred inconsistency all year.
Linebackers: C
I can’t put too much of the blame on the linebackers for McCaffrey’s record setting day. They were meeting him 6 yards passed the line of scrimmage and it is hard to one-on-one tackle that man in the open field. I would have preferred a little more consistency on hitting the gaps in run support, but that might be a bit much to ask for with such a young group. One of the key plays of the game actually came on pass coverage as Buddah Tucker was put one on one with McCaffrey. The Wild Caff ran an angle route and Tucker didn’t stand a chance. The little mistakes cause the biggest plays.
Secondary: C+
I thought this game was Adoree’s best in coverage. He showed his dominant recovery speed on multiple occasions and was physical in hitting the receivers on time. However, it was all for naught as the run game was all Stanford needed. I would have liked to see better run support from our safeties. Marvell Tell saw time and I thought he would thrive in this hard hitting game. However, he was a little too aggressive and missed some fundamental plays. I really like his potential though and I hope to see a lot from him next year. Behind Su’a of course. I always forget to mention him in linebackers. Maybe because he will always be a safety to me.
Special Teams: B-
Big ups to Alex Wood for hitting a big field goal to give USC some points in the first half. Matt Boermeester continues to do a solid job on kickoff duty as well. However, Kris Albarado’s terrible punt once again gave a dangerous return man a great return. That set up Stanford to score and really put us in a terrible position. Hopefully the Aussie Chris Tilbey performs better next year.
We almost had it ladies and gentleman. This could have been our first Rose Bowl since I entered high school. In a week I’ll be done with college. We are long overdue for a big bowl game. I have faith next season. Something is different. I feel like Helton isn’t trying too hard like our last coaches. I think we have great potential at the quarterback position. We always have the talent at the skill positions. The defense needs to be shored up with a new coordinator, but we have talent there as well. Mark my words, if we beat ‘Bama next year we will win the National Championship. First we have to beat a solid Wisconsin team that likes to run it. They have a tough defense that limits opponents to an obscenely low 13 points a game. Hopefully we can stretch the field and utilize the play action pass for some big plays.
Prediction: USC 31- Wisconsin 24
Fight On!
Kessler was never a great QB for USC and really got by as well as he did because of the talent around him and not his skills.  Few of his passes ever went for more than 10 yards and most were sideline passes with lots of yards after the catch.  I doubt he will even be drafted into the NFL given his small stature, weak arm and let’s face it, Kessler is slower than Matt Barkley if that is even possible.  Besides that, USC QBs have been almost without exception, complete failures in the NFL and we all know that Carson Palmer won’t be playing by the time the playoffs come around.

Former USC head coach Steve Sarkisian has filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the University. The 31-page complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday said that USC fired Sarkisian and “kicked him to the curb”, rather than supporting him “when he needed its help the most,” while suffering from alcoholism in October.
The suit states that on Oct. 11, a few days after USC lost at home to Sarkisian’s former program Washington, the second-year head coach pleaded with athletic director Pat Haden to give him time off to get the help he needed to treat his alcoholism, a disability recognized by medical experts and California law.
That same day, Haden placed Sarkisian on indefinite leave and fired him less than 24 hours later. According to the suit, Haden informed Sarkisian of his termination via e-mail, while he “was on a plane to get the help he needed” at an inpatient rehabilitation facility.
The complaint stated that California law required USC to make the reasonable accommodation of giving Steve Sarkisian time off to get help for his disability and then return to his job. Sarkisian is now suing for at least the $12.6 million he was owed by USC under contract, as well as other compensatory and punitive damages.
“Although Steve Sarkisian has now completed an intensive rehabilitation program, is sober and ready to return to coaching, USC has taken away his team, his income and a job that he loved,” the suit read.
The suit as a whole provides a detailed account of the interactions between Sarkisian and the 62-yeard old Haden, dating back to the Salute to Troy incident, where Sarkisian looked to be inebriated, slurred his words and dropped an expletive while delivering a speech in front of USC alumni and donors. According to the suit, Sarkisian had two beers with former USC Assistant Athletic Director Mark Jackson and newly appointed head coach Clay Helton prior to the event and mixed the alcohol with two different medications that had been prescribed to him for anxiety.
After the incident, Haden met with Sarkisian privately and threatened to fire him on the spot. Haden also made Sarkisian sign a letter, requiring him to publicly apologize and attend weekly counseling sessions with a therapist, according to the complaint.
USC’s General Counsel, Carol Mauch Amir, responded to the suit with a statement on Monday afternoon:
“Much of what is stated in the lawsuit filed today by Steve Sarkisian is patently untrue.  While the university does not as a matter of practice comment on personnel matters or litigation, the record will show that Mr. Sarkisian repeatedly denied to university officials that he had a problem with alcohol, never asked for time off to get help, and resisted university efforts to provide him with help. The university made clear in writing that further incidents would result in termination, as it did.  We are profoundly disappointed in how Mr. Sarkisian has mischaracterized the facts and we intend to defend these claims vigorously.”
The suit comes to the forefront two days after the Trojans loss to Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship, and just a week after Haden named Helton the team’s permanent head coach.

The men’s water polo team marched into the 2015 NCAA championship game on Sunday in Westwood looking to take back the title from UCLA, but ultimately came up short in a 10-7 defeat as the Bruins claimed their second consecutive national crown.
Coming into the game 0-3 this season against the Bruins, the Trojans eyed revenge in the most important match of the year. The effort was there, but in the end, USC became just another pawn in an undefeated, 30-0 season for UCLA en route to the title.
“Our team fought hard,” head coach Jovan Vavic said. “It was a great battle. I’m very proud of my players. They were very energized. They fought. They never quit. This is a young team with 14-15 players coming back. We’re going to come back next season.”
The Trojans made their 11th consecutive appearance in the NCAA title match, but have now lost two straight championship games to the Bruins.
With UCLA holding a 7-6 lead to start the fourth quarter, the Bruins outscored the Trojans 3-1 in the final stanza to pull away. Max Irving and Anthony Daboub connected on goals to put UCLA in front 9-6 with four minutes to play.
Blake Edwards’ goal at the 3:21 mark cut the advantage down to two, but the Men of Troy came up empty on their remaining possessions, while the Bruins stood tall on defense and held on for the win.  
“They stopped us when they needed to,” Vavic said. “There were moments in the game when we came back and we made it a one-goal game in the fourth quarter. We didn’t make stops. When they needed to score goals, they shot the ball better than us.”
It started out promising for the Trojans, who jumped out to a 3-1 first period lead on goals by sophomores Matteo Morelli and Lachlan Edwards. But UCLA responded quickly with a pair of goals by Ryder Roberts, 30 seconds apart from the same spot. 
“We leave their best shooter open,” Vavic said. “Why is [Roberts] shooting the ball two times in a row when we’re up 3-1? This is like leaving Michael Jordan wide open. That’s our problem. We got excited, we got a lead and we kind of relaxed. We can’t do that.”
UCLA built off the momentum, scoring four unanswered goals to take a 5-3 lead into halftime. The two teams traded goals for the next six tallies with the Bruins answering every time the Trojans clawed within one.
“[UCLA] was definitely a more poised team,” Vavic said. “When things didn’t go their way, they didn’t panic. They did what they needed to do.”
After Chancellor Ramirez gave UCLA a 7-5 lead with 49 seconds left in the third period, Edwards responded with a power play goal to make it a 7-6 game heading into the fourth.
“Playing in the championship game is a big deal,” sophomore goalie McQuin Baron said. “You’d much rather come up with a win than a loss.”
USC, which outshot UCLA 32-30, entered the title match with wins in the play-in game over Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and in the semifinal match over Cal. But the Trojans, who end their season with a 22-7 record, ran into a UCLA team on a mission to complete a perfect campaign.
“We believed we were going to win the game all the way through,” Vavic said. “We had our chances, even in the fourth quarter. We had our opportunities. We never stopped believing. We’re going to learn from this. We’re going to get stronger from this, for sure.”
