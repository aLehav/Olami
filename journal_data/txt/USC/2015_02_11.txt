The No. 2 Trojans (8-1, 7-1 MPSF) might have dropped their first loss of the season to No. 6 Hawai’i          (7-3, 4-2 MPSF), but that didn’t faze them; they came right back and beat Hawai’i the following match two days later.
To beat Hawai’i is an amazing feat; to beat them in five sets after losing in five sets is ten times as difficult. Considering the Trojans did that last week, this team has the resilience to have deep success this season. Yes, it would be wonderful if they were still undefeated, but the loss helped them in a way. The loss kept the team grounded and focused on the “moment to moment” of each match.
In the first set, the Trojans took a 2-0 (26-28, 23-25) lead over the Rainbow Warriors, but after the break, the Warriors charged back and took the following three sets to win the match                                                                         (25-23, 25-17, 20-18). Redshirt sophomore outside hitter Christopher Orenic and junior opposite Josh Kirchner both had career-high nights with 24 kills and 19 kills, respectively.
In the second set, the Trojans were looking for redemption. After winning the first set 30-28, they lost the next two (17-25, 18-25). The momentum seemed to be in Hawai’i’s favor, but the Trojans pulled out a win in the fourth set 25-18. Arguably the most intense set of the trip was the fifth set. The Rainbow Warriors held the lead for the entirety of the set to 13-10, but with two points away from losing their second match of the season, the Trojans consecutively scored four points to make it 14-13. USC served six match points until junior outside hitter Alex Slaught smashed a huge kill for the win   (20-18). Orenic once again dominated at the nets with 17 kills.
Head coach Bill Ferguson shared that in the first match against Hawai’i the team “battled, but didn’t quite pull it off.” With regard to the following match, Ferguson was beyond pleased with how the team “bounced back really nicely.”
“We never really had them handled or contained until the last couple points,” Ferguson said about the final set of the second match.
Senior setter Micah Christenson continues to rule from the back line. In the two matches against Hawai’i, Christenson recorded two aces in the first match and five in the second. He is ranked second in aces per set both nationally and in the MPSF. The team more or less revolves around its senior                 co-captain. He runs a dominant offense and is ranked sixth nationally for assists and second in the MPSF averaging 10.75 assists per set.
After playing their most intense volleyball game of the season so far, the Trojans come back home to the Galen Center to face No. 7 BYU  (8-2, 7-1) and look to remain undefeated at home.
The two home matches for the Trojans could determine who takes possession of first place in the MPSF standings. USC and BYU are currently tied for first  in the standings with identical 7-1 conference records. BYU’s one conference loss was to UC Santa Barbara, which the Trojans haven’t played yet this season. BYU has also not yet played Hawai’i.
Last year, the Trojans were eliminated by BYU, the regular season winner of the conference, in the first round of the MPSF tournament. The Trojans finished 14-10 in the conference last year, grabbing the last spot in the MPSF tournament, while BYU was the first seed. BYU went on to win the conference tournament, earning an automatic spot in the NCAA tournament.
Ferguson noted that this year’s BYU team has many different weapons, much like his own team. He also said that BYU has two players above 6 feet 10 inches on its roster and that the height should present a good challenge.
“They do everything, they’re actually similar to us,” Ferguson said in his weekly recap. “BYU’s always a sound volleyball team. They’re going to serve and pass well, they’re going to block and hit great. It’s definitely going to be a battle, but it’s going to be a chess match to see who’s actually going to be on the floor.”
The Trojans and BYU will play Feb. 12 and Feb. 13 at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

I would like to make a toast … to the many USC squads that have put up with a  good amount of the Trojan faithful that seem to only care about football.
Now that 2015 National Signing Day is finally behind us and USC football has once again asserted itself as a recruiting powerhouse, I feel like it’s finally time to shift our focus to the USC varsity sports that are actually in full swing of competition.
With the spectacle of recruits signing their letters of intent on national television and illustrating their commitments in intricately produced videos, it’s pretty easy to get caught up in what I call the “USC football 365” type of mentality, but it’s very important to not take for granted the 19 other teams that represent the cardinal and gold every year.
As the sports editor of this publication, I believe that it’s my duty to ensure that these teams receive the proper recognition they deserve for all of their hard work in and out of competition, resulting in a plethora of individual and team awards that contribute to USC’s athletic tradition of excellence.
The greatest thing about the winter and spring seasons, really, is the great range and diversity of sports and world-class venues in which they offer.
Whether it’s a basketball game or volleyball match at the Galen Center, a tennis match at Marks Stadium, a sand volleyball tournament at Merle Norman Stadium, a ball game at Dedeaux Field or even a swim meet at the newly renovated Uytengsu Aquatics Center, one is able to cater to their sporting tastes by spending an afternoon or evening in just about any of these settings.
One of the coolest sights for me so far this year actually was when the women’s lacrosse team, in just its third year as a program, nearly took down the No. 5-ranked Northwestern Wildcats, a national powerhouse, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum last Saturday. Unfortunately, the Women of Troy fell to the Wildcats 11-12 in overtime, though, it’s this type of spectacle that I’m sure Athletic Director Pat Haden envisioned when he brought women’s lacrosse to the West Coast.
There’s really no better time than the winter and spring to highlight these teams because these seasons feature some of the school’s most celebrated and accomplished teams that fall under most people’s radars.
Let’s start off with the No. 6 nationally ranked women’s golf program, who started their spring campaign off on a high note on Tuesday after placing second at the annual Grumman Regional Challenge in nearby Palos Verdes, California.
The Women of Troy will once again have championship aspirations after losing by just two strokes to Duke in the  2014 NCAA Championships, which would have have been its second consecutive national title and fourth in program history under the direction of head coach Andrea Gatson, who is in her 19th year with the program as one of the most highly respected coaches in the country.
Gatson’s team features a few of the nation’s best golfers including senior Doris Chen, who won the 2014 NCAA individual crown and is a three-time All-American. Junior Annie Park is also one of the country’s finest golfers and began this season tied for most wins in school history.
Nonetheless, watch out for the Women of Troy showing off their technical swings on courses across the country.
The program I’m most excited to watch this spring, though, is USC women’s sand volleyball.
In just two years, head coach Anna Collier has taken the Women of Troy to the top of the the sport with her team finishing third nationally during both seasons and coaching the past two national champion pairs teams of Kirby Burnham and Stevi Robinson in 2013, along with Burnham and Sara Hughes in 2014.
With the help of the program’s stunning facility and star-powered coaching staff, Collier has helped pioneer the sport of collegiate volleyball, which will become an NCAA division one championship officially in 2016.
Shifting to the men’s side of things indoors, we know how well the men’s volleyball team is doing based on how my fellow columnist Luke Holthouse exclaimed his love for senior setter Micah Christenson in his weekly party.
Head coach Bill Ferguson and his No. 2-ranked program is off to its best start in 24 years, going undefeated with a perfect 7-0 record before losing to Hawai’i last week.
I know it’s hard to keep up with all of the different sporting events that are going on around us, but I recommend making the effort to become familiar with as many of them as possible.
Now that we’ve all tapped our glasses and this toast has been made, let’s all promise to go out and show these accomplished squads our support this season.
Darian Nourian is a junior majoring in print and digital journalism. He is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Persian Persuasion,” runs Thursdays.
It is very sad that the Trojans are really only supported for football by their fans. There are a few of my friends that attend
most all of the other sports programs mentioned in your article throughout the athletic year. Maybe some bonus can be
given to supporters of the many sport activities outside of football to help promote better attendance at these events.

The USC football team will have another new face on the sidelines this season, as head coach Steve Sarkisian announced Wednesday that Bob Connelly has been named offensive line coach and run game coordinator.
Connelly will take over the role from Tim Drevno, who joined Jim Harbaugh as Michigan’s offensive coordinator after one season at USC.
“We are delighted to have Bob join our staff,” Sarkisian said. “He is a great fit for what we do. He is very familiar with Pac-12 and West Coast football, and he is also very versatile, as he has coached various offensive styles in his career.”
Connelly will look to improve an offensive line that gave up 32 sacks last season, tied for 93rd in the nation with 2.46 sacks allowed per game, and a running game that finished 66th in the nation with 160.9 yards per game. He won’t have last season’s leading rusher, redshirt junior tailback Javorius Allen, who chose to forgo his senior season for the NFL Draft, but will retain all starters on last year’s offensive line. He will also get to work with No. 1 running back Ronald Jones II and No. 3 offensive tackle Chuma Edoga from this year’s recruiting class.
Connelly has been an offensive line coach for 20 years, with previous stops at Alabama, Washington State, UCLA, UTEP, Arizona State and most recently, Oklahoma State, which beat Washington, 30-22, in the Cactus Bowl last season. He has worked with numerous NFL players, including 2008 Outland Trophy winner Andre Smith and            two-time NFL All-Pro Evan Mathis.
Connelly has worked with a top-25 scoring offense in four of his 20 seasons, including at Washington State in 2001 and 2002, UTEP in 2009 and Arizona State in 2012. He helped lead the Cougars to a Rose Bowl appearance in 2003 and the Crimson Tide to a Cotton Bowl appearance in 2006, and he assisted UTEP running back Donald Buckram in setting his school’s single-season rushing record in 2009 with 1,594 yards.
Listed as one of college football’s top 25 recruiters by Rivals.com in 2005 with the Crismon Tide, Connelly will prove to be asset to the Trojans as they look toward their 2016 recruiting class.
Connelly started his coaching career as a graduate assistant at his alma mater Texas                 A&M-Commerce in 1995, where he worked with the offensive line and tight ends. He was an          all-conference offensive guard in 1992 and 1993.
The Trojans will start their highly anticiated 2015 season at the Coliseum against Arkansas State on Sept. 5.

The USC Trojans (9-15, 1-11 Pac-12) lost their ninth-straight game as they fell to the Oregon Ducks (18-7, 8-4) by a final score of 80-75. The Trojans were led by sophomore guard Julian Jacobs who had a balanced game with 18 points, six rebounds and six assists. The Ducks had a balanced scoring effort but were led by redshirt senior guard Joseph Young who scored 26 points.
Redshirt sophomore Darion Clark added 12 points and seven rebounds for the Trojans while sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic had 11 points and five boards. Redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt struggled shooting the ball, 4-13 from the field, and only scored nine points for the Trojans. Sophomore guard Kahlil Dukes shined throughout the game as he scored 8 points and junior guard Chass Bryan added 8 points, but it was really Bryan’s energy that kept USC close in the second half.
While the losing streak is indeed bad news for the Trojans, they received more bad news during their latest loss as freshman guard Jordan McLaughlin left the game with what appeared to be a left shoulder injury. USC head Coach Andy Enfield addressed the injury after the game.
“I didn’t know [about his injury] until he asked to come out of the game,” Enfield said. “He was obviously hurt.”
Aside from Young, the Ducks were productive all around. Redshirt junior forward Elgin Cook had 15 points and freshman forward Dillon Brooks also added 15 for the Ducks. Oregon was able to score the ball in transition throughout the night as USC had problems defending the quick tempo of the Ducks. Enfield praised the Oregon players after the loss.
“Joseph Young is just a tremendous offensive basketball player,” Enfield said. “Elgin Cook and Dillon Brooks really gave us problems because of their athleticism, size and their skill level.”
The Trojans had a chance to tie the game late, but Dukes missed a three and the Trojans were forced to send Oregon to the line, where they put the game out of reach. USC started the second half on a 10-2 run to tie the game; the run was highlighted by a deep three from Jacobs.
Jacobs was not only a leader due to his production, he was also extremely vocal on the court, as the captain directed his teammates throughout the second half. Enfield praised his captain for providing leadership for this young team in a contested game.
“I thought he really did a good job at attacking the rim, using his athleticism,” Enfield added. “Julian decided to take it upon himself to be aggressive and get in the lane and he was able to finish at the rim. He also had six assists, so I thought he was really really good, especially in the second half.”
While Jacobs appeared to more vocal than usual, he said that he still treated it as any other game and tried to lead his team as he does every night.
“I just feel like my job is to be aggressive,” Jacobs said. “When I’m not being aggressive, I feel like I’m at a disadvantage and my team is too.”
Even though USC was able to keep it close yet again, they have not been able to seal the deal during this losing streak, and Clark voiced his frustrations after the latest loss.
“It hurts, we just keep coming close,” Clark said. “We just have to keep fighting, keep playing. We have to understand it’s a process.”
The Trojans started the first half looking as if it was going to be a long night, but they were able to keep it close. USC shot 33.3% in the first half but somehow only trailed the sharp-shooting Ducks by 8; Oregon shot 50% in the first half. Jacobs and Jovanovic both had 7 points at halftime to lead the Trojans. The two sophomores each had spurts in the first half that brought some energy to the Galen Center that fed into the effort of the team as a whole.
The freshmen duo of forward Malik Marquetti and guard Elijah Stewart continued to struggle off the bench as Marquetti only scored 2 points and Stewart was held scoreless once again.
USC will now host the Oregon State Beavers (16-8, 7-5) in their second meeting of the year. The Beavers narrowly beat the Trojans earlier in the year in Oregon by a final score of 59-55. Reinhardt led the Trojans in the loss with 17 points and Jovanovic added 13 points with 6 rebounds. Oregon State was led by junior guard Gary Payton II who had a game high 21 points and 10 rebounds. Payton II is the Beavers’ leading scorer with an average of 12.7 points per game. The game is on Saturday February 14, and tip off is set for 2:00 p.m. at the Galen Center.

Whether you’ve had your calendar marked for weeks before the day or are dreading its very existence, Valentine’s Day will soon be upon us and there isn’t much we can do about it. For some, it’s a day of celebration and carnations, and for others, a day to really not get out of bed. Regardless, the holiday falls on a Saturday this year, which means that we all have a little time to take a breather and feel the love, even as we slowly but surely approach the fiery gates of midterm season.
Throughout campus and the city beyond, there are a variety of Valentine’s Day goings-on and deals that’ll let you romp around completely googly-eyed or as pessimistic as you please. There really is something for all of us.
From a cute weekend brunch spot to a party that lets you bask in your accumulated cynicism (we’re talking voodoo dolls, piñatas — the whole shebang), Cupid’s special day can be spent your way, and it seems that many Angelenos have already gotten creative. Here are some of my picks for things to do this Valentine’s Day weekend.
Attend Stories Books and Café’s “These Are Not Love Poems”
Feb. 12 – 8 p.m. – 1716 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90026
If an evening of bad-ass “oh sh-t, I’m single on Valentine’s Day again” poetry sounds appealing to you, perhaps you should check out this reading event at Stories Books and Café in Echo Park. The featured poets include Nicolette Daskalakis, a recent graduate of The School of Cinematic Arts here at SC and author of Because You’re Now Banging a French Girl. If the rest of the pieces are anything like hers, it should make for a hilariously candid evening of genuine fun.
Catch brunch at Poppy + Rose 
Feb. 14 – 765 S. Wall Street, Los Angeles, CA 90014
Need a last-minute date idea? Are you a morning person? Want food for the sake of wanting food? If so, brunch might be your best bet. Poppy + Rose is an adorable seasonal diner located in the Flower District that throws us back to the sweet times of the country kitchen, when everything was farm fresh and made from scratch. This more sophisticated, updated version still does this and serves up some mean classic favorites, including biscuits and gravy made with house-baked cathead biscuits. There’s also an eggs benedict that is only served on Saturdays, which means there’s already enough love in V-Day for me this year.
Steal a kiss at Qdoba 
Feb. 14 – 655 S Hope St, Los Angeles, CA 90017
This delicious burrito chain is offering a buy-one-get-one-free deal on its smothered burrito — that is, if you kiss someone at the door! Qdoba stresses that said kiss must be consensual, for all you super spontaneous types.
Get a sweet deal at Umami Burger 
various locations
If you haven’t been to an Umami Burger, or you’re a meat or truffle lover, this one’s for you. Until Feb. 15, the Truffle Burger will be going for $8 instead of $12 — not a bad deal. With its truffled aioli, house truffle, cheese and truffle glaze, this burger is brimming with flavor and truffle-y goodness. Make sure to get an order of fries with that too.
Join the original anti-Valentine’s crowd at Birds Café and Bar
Feb. 14 – 5925 Franklin Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90028
There are a shocking, and perhaps marginally concerning, number of anti-Valentine’s events in Los Angeles, but Birds prides itself on being the original. If you need to blow off some emotional steam , it’s rumored that voodoo dolls will be stuck with needles and lit on fire, if that may satisfy your fix. Come for the food, drinks, and the love of not loving; stay for the piñatas meant to commemorate those glorified exes.
Revel in the Broken Hearts Circus at Angel City Brewery 
Feb. 15 – 12 p.m. – 216 S. Alameda St. Los Angeles, CA 90012
If circus-style entertainment puts a smile on your face, come one, come all to Angel City Brewery’s annual (anti?) Valentine’s Day festival. There will be circus-themed food from Market, Burgers, Pizza & Co. and Love Swirls Desserts—enough to bring any nostalgic person back to the best days of childhood. There will also be live music and a Beer Bazaar featuring local art, candles, and vintage wares.
The Vagina Monologues
Feb. 13 – 5 p.m. 
Need to stay on home turf this weekend? Fear not, Ground Zero’s got a show for you that is entertaining just as much as it is impactful. The event will feature a series of monologues narrated by women who have had funny, enlightening, and tragic experiences involving their vaginas—ones that show that a woman is more than just her body. This annual performance aims to promote discussion and help fight to end violence against women. Tickets are sold at the door with a $5 donation. Proceeds go to A Window Between Worlds (AWBW), a nonprofit dedicated to using art as a healing tool to empower and transform individuals and communities impacted by violence and trauma.
Of course, these are just places to start. There’s always the 50 Shades of Grey premiere to look forward to (the soundtrack has some real gems), and there’s always, always Netflix. Have a good one!

Youth showed its strength for the Women of Troy this week as sophomore driver Stephania Haralabidis was named Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week, and freshman goalie Victória Chamorro was named MPSF Newcomer of the Week.
This is Haralabidis’ first Player of the Week award, but she has a history of MPSF recognition as she won Newcomer of the Week on two different occasions last year.
Haralabidis was an unstoppable force for USC this past weekend. In the semifinal game, as the No. 3-ranked Women of Troy competed against No. 11 Cal State University Northridge, Haralabidis scored five goals.  Four of them came in the first half of the game. In the championship game against No. 6 UC Irvine, Haralabidis not only notched a first-period hat trick, but she repeated her dominant scoring performance with another five goals.
Having scored two in each of Saturday’s games against Cal State East Bay and Long Beach State, Haralabidis finished the tournament with 14 total goals.
Haralabidis earned All-America Honorable Mention honors last season, her first at USC.  Haralabidis is a native of Greece who has competed on both the Junior and Senior National Teams.
With the first award of her Trojan career, Chamorro started off the season with a new personal best.  Playing in goal for the Women of Troy for all four quarters of the championship victory against No. 6 UC Irvine, Chamorro captured 15 saves — her new career best.
Chamorro played a total of 13 periods over the weekend for the Women of Troy and garnered 27 total saves.  Over her time in goal, Chamorro allowed only 11 goals during the entire tournament.
Chamorro hails from Brazil and is a member of the Brazilian National Team.
At this weekend’s Triton Invitational, USC won each game by at least five goals.  USC beat Cal State East Bay 22-4, Long Beach State 15-1, No. 6 CSUN 19-3 in the semifinals, and No. 3 UC Irvine in the championship game 10-5. The Women of Troy are undefeated this season with a record of 6-0.  Looking ahead, they will be competing in the Lancer Invitational Friday and Saturday in Riverside, California. With only three senior members on the team, the Women of Troy look to continue building their dynasty with this young talent.

Like many native Southern Californians, I become extremely dramatic when it rains. So when faced with a slight drizzle last weekend, I donned black clothing and visited the Museum of Death.
MOD was founded in 1995 by J.D. Healy and Cathee Shultz, who “realized the void in the death education in this country and decided to make death their life’s work.” Prior to founding the museum, the couple curated a controversial art show featuring work by serial killers.
After exiting the Metro’s Hollywood/Vine station, my friends and I trudged down the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which was devoid of tourists due to the gloomy weather, until we spotted the Museum of Death in all its glory: a small, one-story building concealed by vines and pink flowers. We entered the museum through an iron gate adorned with a giant skull.
I was expecting another weird, kitschy Hollywood experience akin to Ripley’s Believe It or Not! or the Hollywood Wax Museum. Warning signs of MOD’s serious scariness appeared as soon as we entered the building. The gift shop features taxidermied animals, hearts in jars and T-shirts that proclaim, “I passed out at Museum of Death.”
“Should I get the enclosed heart for my girlfriend for Valentine’s Day?” my friend Aaron asked sarcastically.
The museum is split into 12 sections that have names such as “Suicide Hall,” “Antique Mortician Apparatuses” and “Cannibalism Niche.” In the first section, “Serial Killer Archives,” we learned that our own Los Angeles is the serial murder capital of the world.
“There’s something that will make my parents happy,” commented my friend Nicole.
The room features an A to Z guide to serial killers, from Albert Fish to the Zodiac Killer, as well as a helpful list of the “Top 10 Ways to Tell if Your Neighbor’s a Serial Killer.” Telltale signs include changing the channel whenever “America’s Most Wanted” is on, as well as a rapid expansion of the town newspaper’s obituary section.
As an ode to MOD’s start as an art show, walls are covered in the art of serial killers, gallery-style. If you don’t think about how jarring it is to see notorious killers celebrated and memorialized like celebrities, the displays are intriguing. One of the creepiest murderers featured — and in a room dedicated to serial killers, that’s something — was Pogo the Clown, who dressed up as a party clown to gain access to young children. A glass case prominently displays Pogo’s red and white shoes.
As we passed through the “Carnage Corridor,” I hit my limit. Gruesome images that I won’t describe in detail included a crazy wife who’d murdered her husband. Even more disturbing was the MOD description, which noted that the woman was alive and out of prison. Terrified and slightly nauseated, I found myself wondering what brought me here; I’d never even made it through a scary movie. Then I remembered — it was the rain’s fault.
We rushed out of the corridor into the “Room of Skulls,” which included dogs, giraffes and elephants.
“At least we know for sure that everything in here is dead,” said my friend Chai.
The museum is at times educational; it satiates long-festering curiosities. Events like the Manson murders and the Heaven’s Gate scandal, which I’d only heard vaguely about, were explained in explicit detail. MOD went all out in recreating the scene from Heaven’s Gate, a mass suicide that occurred in San Diego in 1997. The display includes actual bunk beds and uniforms from the group.
These investigative qualities were reiterated by Clark, one of the museum’s workers, when asked what we’d been wondering all along — why would anyone want to work here?
Clark reassured me that his career choice was driven by noble curiosity, not a creepy obsession with gruesome death scenes.
“I became interested in the Museum of Death because it describes events that happened when I was a kid, so I never fully understood them,” explained Clark, who now pens many of the museum’s display descriptions.
The museum prides itself on authenticity. Initially, I thought the museum’s $15 admission ($13 for students) was a bit pretentious, until I realized how expensive it is to obtain real Heaven’s Gate uniforms, antique caskets from the 1990s, and the head of Henri Landru, an 1800s French serial killer also known as Bluebeard. Visitors who can stomach fully examining all of the museum’s grotesque displays definitely get their money’s worth of death education.
So, why visit the Museum of Death? Why do people watch horror movies and go to haunted houses? For some reason, fear and entertainment go hand in hand, maybe because the fear of death makes us happy to be alive. We might have left scared and disturbed, but also grateful to be alive.
But mostly disturbed.

Good news for craft beer lovers: the popular brewpub Eagle Rock Brewery has opened a brother restaurant, Eagle Rock Brewery Public House, on Colorado Boulevard. For those who have been to L.A.’s first brewery, they would know that though options are limited, Eagle Rock brews an original and diverse range of beers. Public House seems to follow a similar business model, offering a limited-but-creative fusion menu.
Located between Glendale and Pasadena, Public House is not the most convenient location for USC students. On a crowded night, street parking might be a problem. For those who own cars, and don’t mind driving 20 to 30 minutes and searching for parking, however, Public House is definitely worth a try.
As indicated on its website, Eagle Rock Brewery Public House seeks to “create an intersection” for “craft beer and progressive dining,” as well as a “casual yet purposeful atmosphere.” Given this premise, it should be no surprise that Public House does not serve your typical pub and bar food. Instead of gourmet burgers and nachos, Public House takes gastropub to another level, adding French, Asian and other exotic flavors. Beer lovers looking for a more traditional pub food experience might therefore be disappointed by the experimental fusion.
The cheese plate comes with three kinds of cow cheese samples. The first type is a soft-ripened cheese that resembles the creamy texture of brie. The ripened cheese goes perfectly with the fruit and nut bread, which is perfectly chewy and sweet. The bread, caramelized almonds and walnuts on the side are also amazing complementarities to the soft and slightly bitter cheese. The other two cheeses were more mild. One of them was similar to gouda and the other to American white cheddar. The gouda-like one is too mild for the bread, but delicious on its own. The cheddar-like one is very milky and chewy. It goes well with the nuts but when eaten with the bread, the taste is overshadowed with fruitiness. Overall, the cheese plate is delicate and tasty, and it’s a good choice for less daring customers. But the small portion for the high price can easily steer away budget-conscious customers.
The smoked beef rib might seem like typical bar food, but Public House incorporates Korean and Southern flavors. The rib resembles galbi, a Korean dish made with Korean sauce marinated short beef ribs. The fall-off-the-bone rib was seared nicely; it was perfectly crispy on the surface and moist and tender in the middle. Though the meat was not devoid of fat, the dish as a whole was not greasy. The kimchi puree on the side added a distinct, stimulating taste to the rib. If you like spicy foods, I recommend dipping the meat into the sauce for a Korean barbeque-like flavor. The creamy rice grits on the side add an interesting Southern element to the dish. The rice grits go surprisingly very well with the kimchi, making the sauce milder for those who do not prefer spicy flavor. The fresh Californian greens on the side are also refreshing and tasty. The dish is good for around two people to share, and is not pricey for its quantity. To improve, however, Public House could offer traditional barbeque sauce for customers who prefer American-style ribs, and the portion of the side greens could be larger to set off the heavy ribs.
As for drinks, Public House offers all the Eagle Rock Brewery craft beers. The most popular one from the brewery is Solidarity Black Mild, inspired by the British mild. The beer is easy to drink, and contrary to its dark color, the taste is slightly roasted and sweet with a bit of a coffee aftertaste. For first-timers trying Eagle Rock’s craft beers, Solidarity is a good start to appreciate their beers. The restaurant also offers a small selection of wine and ciders. In addition, it offers some creative non-alcoholic drinks. The Lemmy lemonade soda, for one, goes well with the food for it is not too sweet and is refreshingly fizzy.
The general ambiance is relaxing, as promised in Public House’s premise. The wooden furniture and dangling lights indicate to customers that they can enjoy quality food and relax at the same time. The service is not extraordinary, but is standard; most waiters aren’t talkative, but are friendly. The limited seating might prolong waittime, but the cozy and warm atmosphere is worth the overall experience.
In the future, the restaurant might want to broaden its menu and either lower the prices or offer bigger portions. For a recently opened restaurant though, Public House has done a great job with breaking from the conventional and offering a unique dining experience.

With the proliferation of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in student’s everyday lives, another social media platform might seem a bit extraneous. USC alumnus Steven Puri, however, thinks there might be room for one more.
Enter Pinyata: the site combines the usual mainstays of Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram into one fun platform, according to Puri. The concept is simple: it allows users to have a newsfeed sorted by events, such as “Coachella Weekend One 2015” or “USC vs. UCLA Game Day.” Within these events, the host and its followers can interact with each other by posting photos and comments.
“Our core idea was that our friend group could all share photos from events we were doing, talk about everyone’s photos, meet friends around the edges of our friend circle and talk about what we were doing next,” Puri said. “And have it all nicely organized by event on a calendar.”
And according to Puri, Pinyata is growing. The company reports almost 500,000 posts a day, and 75 percent of users incorporate the app into their daily social media use. Additionally, musicians and Youtubers have been using this app to reach their fans: some notable users include BryanStar, athlete Greg Jennings and charities such as “I Am That Girl”.
Puri said the idea for Pinyata stemmed from nostalgia for Facebook — once a new, budding site.
“A buddy of mine and [I] were talking about how our friend group had left Facebook,” Puri continued. “[Pinyata] is a simple, fun, mobile version of what Facebook used to be.  We talked about what we loved: We loved the pretty photos of Instagram.  We loved how fun and silly Snapchat was.  We loved having conversations in Twitter and GroupMe.”
Puri, who graduated in 1988 with a dual degree in journalism and business adminstration, was formerly vice president of production at 20th Century Fox. He left the entertainment industry to continue his development.
Puri said the lure of the entrepreneurial industry whisked him away from creating movies. He quit his job, and shifted fields in hopes of creating a social platform that would enjoy popularity.
“I got wrapped up in film and made that my full-time job. When I was at VP at Fox, the idea for Pinyata came up and it really grabbed me — the concept of telling stories collaboratively with photos, videos, text and animations.” Puri said. “I spent a few months meeting friends up in San Francisco and discussing it and seeing whether they thought it was viable … and then I took the plunge — both feet in the pool.”
Creating an app from the ground up was no easy feat for Puri.
Along the way, Puri ran into obstacles such as funding as well as creating a competent, passionate team of engineers and staff.
“We probably spent about 18 months getting user input, designing and building before we had our beta. Once in beta, we got people in the field using it and we tuned it as we realized it worked well for friend-groups and organizations … and also well for popular people to use with their followers,” Puri said.
Currently, the application is in its initial stages and canvasing for demographic groups to test it out.
“Right now we’re in the launch phase and we’re looking for groups — especially at ’SC — that want to try it out as a way of telling stories together in photos, videos and GIFs,” Puri said.

Late January, it was announced that the billionaire-industrialist Koch brothers planned to spend $889 million on the 2016 election. While it might seem ludicrous that two individuals behind the second-largest private enterprise can put such a hefty price tag on an election, the move is protected by the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United v. FEC case. According to the court’s decision, campaign contributions are protected under the First Amendment as freedom of speech, a precedent established by the Buckley v. Valeo case in the 1970s.
In defense of the Koch brothers, Rich Lowry of Politico writes, “One sign [America] is still a free country is that a band of like-minded people, devoted to principles they consider essential to the country’s thriving, can get together and try to effect them in public policy.” This, however, implies that freedom is for the wealthy and disregards many other movements consisting of mobilized like-minded individuals. Think #BlackLivesMatter, an international movement in which people responded to the trend of law enforcement murdering black citizens in America without facing any penalty. This outrage and despair prompted many discussions about reforming law enforcement policies, such as requiring police officers to wear body cameras, and attracted mass scrutiny regarding the militarization of local police forces. The numerous officers in question still face no serious charges and no assuring efforts have been enacted in the direction of greater accountability in law enforcement.
Since 2016 is still slowly approaching, it is hard to say whether the Koch brothers have effectively “bought” the election. Candidates with the most funding, however, generally tend to have a significant advantage. The dilemma remains that $80 billion of wealth makes the Koch brothers more powerful in the arena of American politics than millions of protesters on city streets.
The announcement of the Koch contribution echoes the findings of a 2014 study, conducted by Princeton University and Northwestern University, that stated that America is more an oligarchy than a democratic republic. The final report stated, “The central point that emerges from our research is that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while mass-based interest groups and average citizens have little or no independent influence.”
While freedom of speech has been fundamental to American politics since its very inception, the detriment done to democracy by the nation’s ever-growing wealth disparity can no longer be ignored. The Koch donor system is not merely a group of citizens on the same page pushing for what they believe to be best for their country — it epitomizes growing powerlessness of citizens who are most affected by the policies endorsed by the Koch brothers. In 1980, with David Koch as its vice presidential candidate, the libertarian party ran on a platform that advocated for the dissolution of all Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wage laws, welfare, services funded by taxes for children and repeal of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, among other things. Many people cling to the criticism that since an American Idol finale once drew more votes than any presidential election up to that point, the masses have no right to complain about the state of affairs. Perhaps, though, they merely recognize the biased pluralism taking up the public sphere.

Veteran Chris Kyle, the “deadliest sniper” in American history and the main protagonist of the Clint Eastwood-directed war drama American Sniper, is a complicated and polarizing figure due to his one-sided attitude regarding the Iraq War and abrasive claims about his own accomplishments. Because of this, it’s not a surprise that the film adaptation of Kyle’s best-selling autobiography, though generally critically acclaimed for its artistry and acting talent of its stars, raises difficult questions about heroism and the responsibility filmmakers have in portraying complex subjects such as war.
Currently boasting a worldwide box office of around $360 million with a $89.2 million opening weekend, American Sniper has proven to be an explosively successful movie, setting a record for the largest winter box office opening. Despite its popularity, American Sniper has stirred massive controversy and ignited a culture war upon theatrical release. Critics have blamed Eastwood for dumbing down the opposing side of the Middle Eastern conflict by presenting Iraqis as one-dimensional villains who exist merely as targets for Kyle to shoot and further his character development. With the portrayal of Kyle as a tortured war veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, however, Eastwood’s direction heart-wrenchingly shows the nightmarish twilight zone that veterans are thrust into after reentering civilian life. On one hand, American Sniper opposes war by examining the tortured psyche of its main character, but on the other, it glorifies war by glossing over the complexities of the war itself.
The film’s largest point of contention is whether Kyle himself was appropriately portrayed, because just as many people regard him as a bigot as they do a national hero. Kyle, who died last year at the age of 38 after being shot by another PTSD-afflicted veteran, has never shown remorse over the people he’s killed during his career as a military sniper. He called killing Iraqi targets “fun” and claimed he “loved what he did.” Despite Kyle’s questionable perception and obviously racist attitude toward the conflict he was embroiled in, he remains a legendary figure in the U.S. Navy for his undeniable contributions and military finesse during the Iraq War.
In essence, American Sniper is an intensely patriotic movie, a war drama that might provoke controversy because of its source material, but ultimately a film created to entertain and emotionally affect audiences. It was within Eastwood’s artistic freedom to selectively turn the lens toward his own vision for what he wanted the movie to be, and we cannot have expected him, or any other director for that matter, to carry the responsibility of appeasing all the varied opinions about his subject matter. The real-life Chris Kyle is not the tortured, noble, empathetic yet still-deadly war hero that we imagine, and it is a valid observation that the movie sands over many of Kyle’s flaws in order to prod the audience into sympathizing with him on the big screen. Eastwood’s work, though, is not meant to be a documentary or even a holistic view of Kyle. It selectively uses Kyle’s experiences to construct an angle that focuses on a particular, unavoidable facet of a soldier’s life: the traumatic effects of war on one’s home life and psyche.
In the wake of endless backlash against Eastwood for glorifying what some call a “redneck mass killer,” Bradley Cooper, the actor who portrays Kyle, has defended the intent of the movie as a “character study about what the plight is for a soldier” that’s not a “political discussion about war” but a “discussion about the reality.” The raging debate around this film just goes to show that the American public has not realized Eastwood’s simplistic intent for the film. The question surrounding the picture shouldn’t be whether the portrayal of Kyle and the Iraq War was accurate, but whether it achieved its purpose of giving audiences insight into a soldier’s experiences and the far-reaching ramifications of wartime duty.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to address a joint session of Congress on March 3 at the invitation of House Speaker John Boehner. Considering the tradition of notifying President Barack Obama of scheduled congressional speakers, it is rather odd for Netanyahu to give a speech in the United States without prior consultation with the president, and particularly perplexing considering he’s set to make his appearance a mere two weeks before elections in Israel, where he and his party are up for re-election.
Both Democrats in Congress and factions within Israel disapprove of Netanyahu’s planned appearance. His visit shows that he is willing to politicize diplomacy in order to achieve policy goals. Netanyahu and Republicans have no particular affinity toward the Obama administration policy on Iran.
Talks among world powers on the Iranian nuclear issue are set to expire March 23. Netanyahu, as a foreign head of government who is up for re-election,  plays with fire in giving a speech. On the world stage, contemporary geopolitical literature reads the United States and Israel as strong allies in a region which Israel hardly has any. With a move like this, it demonstrates to the rest of the globe that the relationship is becoming less and less United States-Israel and increasingly more Republican-Israel, which would teeter the delicate balance in Iranian relations.
Netanyahu’s decision to accept the invitation is further damaging considering he’s not scheduled to meet with the president during his trip to Washington. It’s hard to imagine diplomacy taking place between two powers when the two leaders fail to meet. If the relationship between Israel and the United States is going to continue having any clout, then it is imperative that the two parties appear in sync and a sense of parity in terms of diplomatic goals must be met. On the Israeli front, is it fair to the other parties to allow Netanyahu to effectively stump into a foreign country with a wider audience? Considering that Netanyahu and his competitor, Isaac Herzog of the Labor Party, are in the middle of a very competitive headlock, Netanyahu’s speech might further alienate himself from not only the Labor Party, but from voters as well.
Many view national security as one of the most important issues in the election this year. Voters want a leader who can ensure their safety and defense against any attack. Going to Congress with fierce rhetoric over Iran is an opportunity for Netanyahu, who is already facing increasing criticism within Israel, to underscore his commitment to Israel’s safety. Though he might see his speech as an avenue to broadcast his message, voters in Israel are growing tired of the political drama that accompanies their prime minister wherever he goes.
There is just too much on the line at the moment for Netanyahu to address Congress. Since Israel was wrought from war in 1948, the United States has been allies with the Jewish state, staying by its side through treaties, negotiations and a myriad of wars. For much of that history, it has demonstrated an attitude that kowtowed to the policy demands of Israel. Now, rather than curry the favor of Netanyahu and express support of a stauncher anti-Iranian nuclear-power policy, Netanyahu should analyze the implications of his visit, which he refuses to cancel. On the same token, how would the international community respond if British Prime Minister David Cameron accepted an invitation to speak in front of the German Diet at the behest of Bundestag President Norbert Lammert without the knowledge of Prime Minister Angela Merkel? Or how would Republicans react if Obama invited Pakistani President Mamnoon Hussain for high-level anti-terror talks without informing a single senator or representative?
It benefits neither the United States nor Netanyahu if the latter addresses Congress. Putting politics ahead of diplomacy and advancing a policy agenda with no regard for global ramifications is shameful and irresponsible. It puts at risk the United States-Israel relationship and makes politics the narrative rather than substantive discourse on important and serious policy decisions that affect an entire region. It is unlikely that Netanyahu will cancel his appearance, as he sees this as an opportunity to further push sanctions and tougher rhetoric toward Iran. The best option in order to mitigate any fallout or damage from the embattled planned appearance is to schedule it under a closed joint session of Congress, rather than making it available to the public. With elections around the corner, this speech is one risk that Netanyahu is apparently willing to take, a risk that is a mistake.

What is anti-Valentine’s Day? Below you’ll get a breakdown of why you should become your own anti-Valentine and how to celebrate this festive Feb. 14 holiday.
WHY? If you agree with any of the following statements, you’re already half way there! Read more for reasons to denounce the day dedicated to projecting the consumerist, Hallmark notion of “love.” (Two reasons why Valentine’s Day is stupid).
For singles: 
One in five women suffer from desperate dry girl syndrome. Symptoms include referring to Feb. 14 as “Single Awareness Day!” Posting excessively on social media will result in side effects such as manifesting self-pity, romanticizing relationships, failing in an attempt to be witty or sarcastic. Seek medical help if loneliness persists or if attention-seeking worsens. Do not drive or operate machinery as it will probably result in you crying into a donut while driving. Talk to your local pharmacy to learn more about what it means to hold your own, to love yourself and to be okay with being alone. Until then, have fun celebrating S.A.D. Happy Single Awareness Day!

For Couples:
The worst thing about Valentine’s Day is the incessant Instagram posts, Facebook default changes and picture tweets with no caption. It’s like Coachella for couples: pics or it didn’t happen. Once you hit share, you are immediately desensitizing yourself to what relationships and love actually are: a moment goes from the intimacy of one person’s eyes to something the whole world can see. Keep in mind social media perpetuates fakeness, relationships are not all bae goals and rom-com dates:
In other words, next time you share a post, ask yourself, “What am I trying to prove?”

HOW? Now that your a Valen-cynic, here is your guide to gift-giving yourself or your significant other. 
For Singles:
To all of the anti-Valentines, just because no one loves you does not mean you still can’t be drunk in love. Every time you see a heart-eyes emoji out of context, take a shot.

For Couples: 
There are three types of Valentine’s Day gifts, all of which are pretty weird if you think about it. There are the cliches like chocolate, flowers, and jewelry. What these gifts really do are make you fat, suggest you need to smell better, and turn your wrist green via a Forever21 bracelet. Wow, true love never dies.

There is a risqué option for cheap and thirsty boyfriends. Today of all days, your boyfriend gifts you lingerie just to show how much you are appreciated, underwear is your market value equivalent. Don’t worry, he totally likes you for your personality.

(Said no one ever).
Basically, gift-giving on V-Day is a trap. You are telling someone ‘this is how much you are worth to me’ (valued at equal or lesser value of probably 30 bucks). He loves you three trips to Nekter much (aw).

And, last but not least, for everyone: 
The best part of anti-Valentine’s Day is the proliferation of V-Day MEMES!

Are you a fan of chicken, veggies and/or cooking on your own?
Recently I found a recipe that is healthy, easy to make and in my opinion, a lot more flavorful than dining hall food.
For this dinner recipe you will need:
First, preheat your oven to 450 degrees.
Chop the vegetables and toss them together with just enough olive oil to lightly coat them. Season with preferred spices (I just used salt and pepper.)
Pour these prepped vegetables into a baking dish in an even layer.
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
Place your cleaned and cut chicken breasts on top of the layer of vegetables and cover each breast completely with hummus. Sprinkling a pinch or two of spices on top of the chicken and hummus is a good idea as well. (Two baking dishes can be used for this recipe, one for the vegetables and one for the chicken, but if you’re like me, you will try to use the least amount of dishes possible to avoiding prolonging dishwashing later.)
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan

Squeeze lemon juice over the chicken and veggies. The original recipe calls for the juice of an entire lemon, but I found the lemon to be a bit overpowering when it came to the mix of flavors produced. If you really like lemon though, you can even put thin slices of lemon in between the chicken and veggies.
Bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until your chicken is thoroughly cooked and your vegetables are at their desirable level of soft or firmness.
I also decided to pair this dish with a side of roasted red potatoes as it only takes a few minutes to wash and prep them. I washed and roughly chopped mini red potatoes into square and wedge pieces and tossed them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and paprika-again the spices are up to you!
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
I baked them for probably about 45 minutes at the same oven temp for the chicken, but you can take them out when they reach your preferred level of crispiness!
I recommend you work on homework, learn Mandarin, go for a run or watch an episode of Gossip Girl while you wait. Just a few suggestions. Most importantly, though, let your meal cool just a bit and enjoy a satisfyingly healthy and delicious meal that came straight from your kitchen!

The University Student Government Senate held a meeting at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Tuesday night, which included presentations by USG University Affairs, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Diversity Affairs and the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, QuASA directors Robby Sachs and Alyssa Coffey discussed various events that the organization has held this past semester.
These events include a Welcome Back Barbecue, Beyond Your Gay Straight Alliance, a beach bonfire, a dodgeball game and a freshman sleepover. Sachs and Coffey also discussed progress that has been made in new member organizations, such as Queers in Engineering, Science and Technology and the film group SCA Queer Cut.
“I’m really excited about new member organizations,” Sachs said. “We’ve had a lot of momentum this year with the joining of different groups that I think are really underrepresented, and that can really bring a strong and diverse voice to the queer space on campus.”
Coffey explained that though there have been improvements in increasing visibility for the queer community, there is more to work on.
“I think there’s a lot of good potential and a lot of interesting things coming out of the queer community,” Coffey said. “But there’s a lot of more potential for visibility on campus. I think that over the past year, on-trend with national issues such as marriage equality, the queer community on campus has fallen back. However, there are also a lot more issues that groups on campus are becoming more active on and engaging with, so there’s a little burning fire that is going to kick up in the next few years.”
QuASA directors also detailed upcoming events, which include a spirituality and sexuality retreat, a generation queer retreat and a second-chance prom for students who had a poor prom experience.
Sachs explained that he is looking forward to the second-chance prom because it will bring the USC queer community together.
“I’m glad that we have this event,” Sachs said. “It really is a second chance for freshmen to relive their prom, or for anyone really. But it’s also a celebration of the queer community at USC. It’s really cool to see to all these people turn out.”
Furthermore, Sachs discussed the powerful impact the event would have on students who felt segregated from their peers in high school.
“It’s a really important opportunity. I think prom is an important memory for people, especially if that memory is tainted with the problems of high school of not being out or not being who you really want to be,” Coffey said. “So having the chance to do it in college, where it’s a safer space for you, you can go with who you want, you can go how you want, you can wear what you want, you can be who you want to be, and that’s an important and liberating opportunity.”
The Senate meeting also included presentions of new campus developments, such as the new Uber-Campus Cruiser partnership, the free LAX shuttle for students, Moreton Fig renovations, new water bottle filling stations, dorm renovations and a price cap for general education textbooks — a project that will require an intricate study of class syllabi and textbook pricing.
“I think within a GE category you shouldn’t have to be choosing a course based on how much the materials cost, granted that science books are worth more than English books,” Director of University Affairs Jordan Fowler said.
APASA, the second-largest student organization at USC with over 8,000 members, also discussed events they held during this semester. These events included a voter registration campaign, night market, APAHF extravaganza and a winter wonderland.
Upcoming events include, Vote On, a USG presidential candidate forum, APASA’s Got Talent, Asian Pacific Film Week and a Little Taste of Tokyo Cultural Tour, among others.

The USC Trojans men’s basketball team will return home after a short two-game road trip up the California coastline. The Trojans (9-14, 1-11) lost both games in heartbreaking fashion.
In the first game against the California Bears, the Trojans were beaten at the buzzer,  70-69 by a Tyrone Wallace three-pointer. In the following game against the Stanford Cardinal, the Trojans let a six-point lead in the first half slip en route to a 70-62 loss.
With those two losses, the Trojans have now lost eight in a row and 10 of their last 11. Despite a few second-half collapses, the Trojans have played fairly well against Pac-12 competition.     Unfortunately, the Trojans are lacking the results to back their play. During their eight-game losing the streak, the Trojans lost six games by fewer than eight points.
Things won’t get any easier as the Oregon Ducks (17-7, 7-4) head into the Galen Center on Wednesday night. The Ducks have won nine straight against the Trojans since 2009.
The last time USC and Oregon faced off, the Ducks were able to come away with a 75-67 victory. Oregon, using its size advantage, outrebounded the Trojans 45-37, a common theme this season for Andy Enfield’s squad.
A bright point for Trojan fans is the recent play of guards Jordan McLaughlin and Katin Reinhardt.
After being held to 0 points on 0-7 shooting against Utah last week, McLaughlin had a strong road trip. In the two games against Cal and Stanford, McLaughlin finished with a total of 38 points, 11 assists, nine rebounds and five steals.
After a slow start to the season, Reinhardt has come on as of late. The transfer from UNLV has scored in double digits, including a 35-point explosion last week, in seven of the last eight games.
While McLaughlin has finally come out of his slump, second-year big man Nikola Jovanovic has struggled lately.      The 6-foot-11 Serbian has been held under double digits in the last three games. This comes after Jovanovic scored in double digits for 12 straight games.
The USC offense goes and comes with the play of McLaughlin and Jovanovic. Along with the rest of the team, both players have had up and down seasons, which is expected with such a young squad.
If the Trojans hope to compete against the Ducks, both McLaughlin and Jovanovic will need to play to their potential.
The Trojans have been outrebounded by 50 over their last seven games. The Ducks will look to expose this weakness. Led by the front-court duo of Jordan Bell and Elgin Cook, the Ducks field one of the larger front courts in the Pac-12 and are currently ranked 34th in the country with 38.2                                                 rebounds per game.
USC will need to rebound as a team and hope Jovanovic can stay out of foul trouble. Against Stanford, the sophomore was held to just 18 minutes due to foul trouble, helping Stanford to a  50-35 rebounding edge. Along with their interior size, the Ducks are led by the second-leading scorer in the Pac-12, Joseph Young.
