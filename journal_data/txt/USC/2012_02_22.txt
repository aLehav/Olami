Paul Linaman was working as a barista at Peet’s Coffee and Tea when the company began making changes that included firing some of its best employees at a time when unemployment rates were soaring.
“It was a company that had been going through all these transitions,” Linaman said. “The transition was very rough. I was really upset at the time, but [being fired] turned out to be a really good thing.”

Linaman, now a salad chef at Seeds Marketplace, took the job loss as an opportunity to improve his culinary skills. At the time, his mother was the associate director of St. Joseph’s Center, a service center for poor and homeless families, which acquired an unused restaurant as a donation. The donated location served two functions: providing free restaurant-style meals for the homeless and providing what Linaman calls “crash-course culinary training” for chefs of varying skill levels.
“It was a wide variety of people,” Linaman said. “It was people who were just out of college, like one young woman who, her whole life, had worked with her mom’s catering business, but now wanted to get a job at a restaurant. It was people who had been laid off, usually people in the industry who wanted a little extra training in order to get their careers going again.”
After the course, Linaman worked at the Hard Rock Cafe in Hollywood but said he lost his position when the franchise laid off about two-thirds of its chefs. He once again refused to let the loss of a job he loved discourage him, so after a few weeks off, he applied for a job with USC Hospitality in 2010.
During a kitchen test, Linaman made pasta primavera but had to turn to improvisation when he ran out of time to cook the noodles after finishing the meat and vegetables.
“I called it ‘Paleolithic primavera’ because I noticed that sometimes on Top Chef, when they mean to make something but run out of time, they sometimes make up stories and the judges usually love it,” Linaman said. “My story was that it’s part of the trend of being on the Paleolithic diet, where you eat as if you’re a hunter-gatherer.”
Linaman was already familiar with this audition-like application process and had previously developed his improvisation skills after growing up in Los Feliz, where he became involved in performing arts at a young age.
“As soon as there was any theater available to be involved in, I was,” Linaman said. “As soon as I was in junior high and they had drama class, I started taking that. I was really involved in play production in high school.”
After attending Santa Monica College, he transferred to New York University to study theater, where he participated in many student productions. His favorite was a play about the last days of the Trojan prophet Cassandra.
“It was interesting because it was an original play, and [the professor] was rewriting it while we were working on it,” Linaman said. “The author was right there so we could ask her questions. I could tell that she was rewriting based on what she saw.”
After college, Linaman moved back to Los Feliz. He said that, despite his love for theater, he did not want to enter into the competitive world of Broadway. He has not been involved in any formal productions since his return to California but is interested in returning when the opportunity arises. He has found, however, that some theater school lessons apply to other aspects of his life.
“When I’m making salads, the physical structure of it is kind of a choreographic narrative,” Linaman said. “Being able to focus on that is very theatrical. It’s the capacity to put yourself in structures, and live within the structures in a particular way.”
Linaman’s theatrical experiences also led to an interest in psychoanalysis, something he is now interested in pursuing in graduate school.
“There’s a few professors who I want to meet but haven’t quite had the courage to just walk into their offices,” Linaman said. “I didn’t even realize they taught here when I first started reading [their books].”
He has been considering USC for a master’s degree in comparative literature, a program that would not only allow him to further his education but perhaps give him the chance to meet some of his favorite writers.
I agree with Katie. I like getting to know more about the people I regularly see on campus. It strengthens our community.
Would he not be more worthy of an article if he had fled a civil war in Central America and eventually became a citizen?
Glad the DT featured him… He’s a very nice man and deserves recognition for all of the hard work he does!

Crimes against property
At 5:05 p.m. on Feb, 20, a suspect smashed the passenger-side window of a car on Jefferson Boulevard and Royal Street to gain entry, and removed a laptop computer, a pair of headphones, miscellaneous clothing and a backpack. DPS officers were flagged down by a witness and located the suspect during a search of the area, but he managed to elude them. The suspect abandoned the property while being pursued, and it was subsequently recovered by the officers.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 5:51 p.m. on Feb. 21, DPS officers responded to Webb Tower to check on the welfare of a student after a friend reported receiving a message from her in which she claimed that she was going to harm herself. The student was unharmed when contacted by the officers and they placed her in contact with an on-call counselor at the Student Counseling Center. The officers cleared the scene after the student was determined not to be a danger to herself or others.
At 5:05 p.m. on Feb. 21, a suspect claiming to be a bank representative entered the USC Credit Union Building with a staff member and attempted to get him to withdraw money from his account in order to satisfy a past due mortgage. A teller recognized the situation as being suspicious and when she pulled the staff member aside to speak to a manager the suspect fled. DPS officers responded and conducted a search but were unable to locate the suspect.
At 7:15 p.m. on Feb. 20, DPS officers responded to a student who sustained abrasions to his face when a parking control arm on 34th Street and Trousdale Parkway lowered and struck him as he walked past it. The officers examined the student and offered transportation for medical treatment, but he declined and was released to seek it on his own.
No crime on 28th?  Is Mikey now controlling the free flow of Row related crime news?
I wish I could of gone to USC, from Jenks Trojans!

The USC Fisher Museum of Art opened Through the Lens, an exhibit that showcases artwork of elementary school students from USC’s Family of Schools, on Wednesday.
It is the third exhibit for Art in the Village, a visual arts outreach program that encourages local elementary school students to create art in the classroom. Funded in part by a USC Neighborhood Outreach Grant, the program also displays some of the artwork in the University Village Shopping Center.

Students who submitted artwork for consideration in the exhibit were required to create a work of art as if they were a camera, capturing the different ways we use photography. A jury of USC students judged the artworks created by the elementary school students and the top picks were recognized and awarded at the opening reception. The artwork is on display to the public at the University Village Food Court until March 30.
Vanessa Jorion, the Fisher Museum education and program coordinator, said Art in the Village was created 10 years ago to bring more arts into the USC Family of Schools. Every year, Art in the Village provides art lessons and quality art supplies for teachers to incorporate into their classrooms so students can express their creativity.
“Art in the Village provides an outlet for students who really need it,” Jorion said. “The program has given a lot of kids confidence. A lot of students may not necessarily be excelling in math or English, but they may be excelling at art.”
Jorion said the program has not only provided students with a necessary creative avenue but has gotten them to interact with the outside community.
“The program allows students to put their art on display for others in the community to look at and receive,” Jorion said. “The community is able to read what the students write about their artwork, and this boosts their confidence. It’s what students need because, without the arts, they are not getting this reinforcement.”
Teachers in the USC Family of Schools also said this program is an integral part of the students’ creative development.
Eugene Timiraos, the fourth-grade teacher at 32nd Street USC Magnet School, said the exhibit allows students to appreciate their work and reflects USC’s impact in the community.
“This exhibit is an example of how USC is to the surrounding community and my respect for USC has only continued to grow,” Timiraos said. “The recognition it gives to kids in the local schools is wonderful. To have their artwork exhibited like this — kids begin to realize how special their work is.”
Taj Henry, a second-grade student at the Dr. Theodore T. Alexander, Jr. Science Center School was excited to share his artwork with his family and friends.
“I drew a picture inspired by Legos and blocks,” Henry said. “With art, I get to draw or write or picture anything I want. It makes me feel good and I am happy that my family is here to see it.”
Parents of the students who were chosen said the program provides an opportunity for the community to get together and support the family of schools.
“I know that my son is proud to be able to represent his school here,” said Randal Henry, Taj’s father. “It’s nice to see a cohesive, multi-school presence unified in children’s development.”
Alma Carillo, whose son has a piece in the show, said the program instills their children with a sense of excitement for the arts.
“My son came home very excited after he found out that he was chosen,” Carillo said. “Adrian can be quiet and keep to himself, so it is so special to be able to see what he wrote about his piece, and I am happy that other kids get to see it too. He wanted us to be able to see it … and to have his award up for everyone to see is very special.”
The program is one reflection of the larger partnerships USC has with the neighborhood.
“The exhibits allow the community to see what’s going on in the neighborhood school,” Jorian said. “The artwork livens up the space and brings a lot of people from the community together.”

Renowned poet, educator and activist Nikki Giovanni spoke Wednesday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center as part of the USC Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics’ series, Knowing Thyself: Authenticity and Ethos.
Giovanni spoke about her disappointment with war and domestic violence, changes in social ideas, such as the Occupy movement, and her experiences with everyone from college athletes to fellow civil rights leaders.
Humanity · Poet, educator and activist Nikki Giovanni said arts and politics should intersect to ensure citizens are empathetic. - Adrian Hoffmann | Daily Trojan
Giovanni said education is important in being “a sane human being,” and discussed the prospect of one day being grandmother to a Martian baby when Earth inevitably becomes uninhabitable to illustrate the unpredictability of the future.
“We’re going to need to make adjustments,” Giovanni said. “What makes us think we shouldn’t be extinct? My grandson will come home and introduce me to his Martian girlfriend because that’s where we have to go.”
This year’s Levan Lectures focus on the individual and the power one has to make a difference in oneself and the lives of others.
Giovanni is the USC Levan Institute’s third distinguished speaker, following Danielle Allan, a political theorist, and Anthony Kronman, former dean of Yale Law School.
Giovanni said the intersection of art and politics is an important part of society.
“[Politicians] attack art as if we could possibly have a nation without it; without it, how do we become good citizens?” Giovanni said. “We don’t. We need empathy, which we get from putting ourselves artistically into other’s shoes.”
Giovanni gave a detailed account of her friend Rosa Parks and read a poem she wrote in Parks’ honor.
“It was Ms. Rosa Parks willing to sacrifice life so that [Emmitt Till] would have not died in vain. … It was not being able to stand [that debt] that she sat back down,” Giovanni said.
Giovanni juxtaposed ambitious ideas about the future with historical relevance. She said she was excited about space travel, hoping that “one day space travel can be a sort of pick-up line.”
In her poem “We’re Going to Mars,” Giovanni said those wanting to travel to Mars need to understand how to endure as the African-Americans did on the Middle Passage.
Giovanni said students should strive to achieve happiness during their lives.
“The founding fathers added ‘the pursuit of happiness’ to the Declaration for a reason,” Giovanni said. “Happiness is attainable, and if you don’t recognize this as the real world, there never will be a real world out there. This is it.”
Ran Woodfin, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, said he appreciated Giovanni’s insight.
“Giovanni was eager to share her knowledge she has gained through the years and also with the revolutionary movements of today,” Woodfin said.
Leah Young, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, said she attended the event because she wanted to increase her awareness of different cultures.
“I’ve been expanding my cultural horizons,” she said. “It’s important for people to learn about art outside of their major and want to create their own expressions.”
The USC Levan Institute collaborates with departments, professional schools and programs across the university to bring students and faculty together with authors, philosophers, practitioners and the ethical voices of our time.

The City of Los Angeles Redistricting Commission held its final meeting on redistricting, which could result in parts of USC being represented in two districts, on Wednesday in the John Ferraro Council Chamber at City Hall.
Hundreds of residents and community members filled out comment cards and waited for their turn to voice their concerns to influence the final vote of the proposed district maps.
Redistricting occurs every 10 years and this year 21 members of the city’s redistricting commission have made alterations to the current district map. The Los Angeles City Council must approve the new district map by July 1.
USC, which is currently in City Council District 8 represented by City Councilman Bernard C. Parks, might be split into two districts under the newly proposed district map.
The University Park Campus and neighboring Exposition Park, including the Coliseum, would move to City Council District 9 represented by City Councilmember Jan Perry. Off-campus student housing to the north and west of campus would remain as part of District 8.
Thomas Sayles, senior vice president of university relations, said at the public hearing that USC should remain in one district.
“All other universities in this city are in a single district,” Sayles said. “It just makes sense.”
David Galaviz, executive director of local government relations at USC, said the university’s desire to be in one district is not politically driven.
“As an academic institution focusing on academic research and educating students, we are not taking a political position on redistricting,” Galaviz said. “We’re not pushing to be added to any district or to be taken out of our current district. We just want to be in one district. All other universities in Los Angeles are in one district. USC would be the only one split among districts.”
Twenty-two public hearings have taken place across all current city council districts since December 2011 and more than 4,500 comments have been submitted by Los Angeles residents.
Each speaker at Wednesday’s public hearing was allowed one minute. Some residents pushed for changes to be made in redistricting, such as those to Benedict Canyon, while others spoke against proposed redistricting for Downtown Los Angeles.
Perry, the District 9 representative, said she was against the newly proposed redistricting.
“The newly proposed lines are troubling and unnecessary,” Perry said. “[The commissioners] have not listened. I speak today that you have made a mistake.”
Lark Galloway-Gilliam, an employee of Community Health Councils Inc., located in District 9, said the commission failed to recognize the economic effects of the proposed redistricting.
“You have to understand the political and economic conditions,” Galloway-Gilliam said. “The proposed district changes for [District 9] seek to isolate and disenfranchise communities.”
I encourage this reporter to dig deeper. Redistricting in the city of Los Angeles is goverment at it’s very worst. Please write about the political bullying (Herb Wesson), back room deals, commission appoinments that rigged the process and violations of the voter rights act. Redistricting commission is disrespectful of people like myself that believe in the process and had faith in local government.
You can’t write a artical on redistricting with out interviewing, Grace Yoo of the Korean Americian Coalition, Bernard Parks CD8, Jan Perry CD9 or Bill Rosendahl CD11.  Nothing about these draft maps make any sense.
The commission largely ignored the public comment unless it agreed with their puppet master.

After playing their first eight matches at neutral sites, the Women of Troy finally get to show what they can do in their home pool.
No. 2 USC (7-1) hosts No. 6 Hawai’i (2-3) in a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference clash Thursday at 5 p.m., hoping to continue its six-match winning streak.
“We’re going to have to go out and play really good team defense,” senior All-American driver Nadia Dan said. “We have a lot of depth this year, so we’re going to be playing a lot of girls and hopefully wear them out.”
Nearly every position player on the roster has scored multiple goals for the Women of Troy, with 18 players netting at least two points.
Sophomore two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist has led the offensive onslaught so far, scoring 15 goals, matching her season total from her freshman campaign.
“I haven’t really been thinking about it,” Gilchrist said. “Goals will come. But goals don’t really win national championships, defense does.”
The Women of Troy haven’t been too shabby on defense, either.
Only No. 1 Stanford has managed to net more than six goals on the Women of Troy, who only gave up a total of 12 goals in their four matches at the Lancer Invitational last weekend while mostly resting their starters.
Sophomore All-American goalkeeper Flora Bolonyai works as the fulcrum of the tenacious defense.
“Hands down, I can say Flora’s the best goalie in the nation,” Gilchrist said. “It’s awesome to know that just in case one of us screws up, we have [Bolonyai] in the goal to back us up.”
Bolonyai, who helped her native Hungarian team win the bronze medal at the European Championships last month, is averaging 6.7 saves per game while only allowing 5.1 goals per game.
Bolonyai will try to keep the Rainbow Wahine at bay in Hawai’i’s first match since Feb. 5.
The Rainbow Wahine (2-3) have more losses than wins, but their three losses have come at the hands of either No. 3 UCLA and No. 4 California.
“They had pretty solid games against UCLA and Cal,” Dan said. “They’re a good team, and they have a good goalie.”
Hawai’i goalie Serena Reid is averaging 8.2 saves and 7 goals allowed per game.
The Women of Troy eked out a 5-4 overtime win against Hawai’i last season and currently own an 11-game winning streak over their MPSF rivals.

After a strong showing at the Intercollegiate Tennis Assocation Indoor National Championships, including USC’s first semifinal appearance since 2003, the Women of Troy begin a five-game homestand this weekend against UC Santa Barbara and No. 5 California.
With wins over then-No. 8 North Carolina and then-No. 17 Tennessee in Virginia two weeks ago, USC (7-1) has broken into the top 10 for the first time in nearly two years.
The now-No. 7 Women of Troy have a full slate this weekend starting off against UC Santa Barbara on Thursday at 1:30 p.m.
USC’s last loss to UCSB occurred in 2003 and USC holds a 22-1 all-time record against the Gauchos.
For coach Richard Gallien’s group, Thursday is a perfect way to continue to build off the momentum of the first few weeks of the season as the rival Golden Bears head into Marks Stadium on Saturday.
This early-season matchup against Cal is a great measuring stick for the Women of Troy to see where they fall in the hotly contested Pac-12 conference. Despite a 31-30 all-time advantage over the Bears, USC will be looking to snap a five-game losing streak against Cal.
Just like USC made a semifinals run in the ITA Indoor Championships, Cal (6-1) also reached the final four of the tournament before losing to No. 3 Duke, which was virtually playing a home game in Virginia.
Even with the loss to Duke, the Bears were remained in the ITA top five and they are led by a core of four top-100 singles players, including No. 3 Jana Juricova.
Along with Juricova, the Bears have No. 23 Zsofi Susanyi, No. 48 Tayler Davis and No. 85 Anett Schutting, not to mention No. 103 Cecilia Estlander, rounding out a powerful top five in singles.
Fortunately for the Women of Troy, depth has been paramount to their success and it was never more evident than two weeks ago in Virginia when three different players each recorded match-ending wins.
Gallien has raved about the maturity of his group, especially the freshmen who have been plugged into the starting lineup: No. 10 Zoë Scandalis, No. 24 Sabrina Santamaria and Gabriella DeSimone.
For the freshmen, this weekend’s matchup with Cal is just another step in the development of their young careers, but it also represents a changing of the guard in the Pac-12.
While the season’s still young, this weekend will give coach Gallien more insight into how far USC can go this season and in the future. Rivalry games against Cal will always have an air of importance around them, and with both teams ranked in the top 10 this early in the season, the struggle for power in the Pac-12 seems to be starting already.

Seven years ago, after being kicked off campus, the Ski and Snowboard Team was reinstated on campus. At the time, they were a small group of Trojans with a love and passion for skiing and snowboarding.
None of them anticipated the popularity or success that their team now enjoys. Today, the team is 120 members strong with numerous victories under its belt.

The past three years USC has dominated the freestyle skiing competition at the national level. The Trojans won nationals in 2009 and 2010 and claimed second place in 2011.
“We were disappointed with our close second place finish last year,” said team president Paul Glavin.
“But to our credit we were missing two of our stronger performers, Caleb and Chris Farro, who were abroad. This year we are at full potency to take down the big dogs with style.”
This year, from March 5-10, the team will travel to Sunday River, Maine, looking to annihilate the competition once again and to claim national victory over more than 50 universities from around the country.
To the Trojans, the fact that most of the universities competing are from the East Coast is irrelevant.
“We expect to win,” said Matt Cook, vice president of the team. Their level of confidence might seem puzzling, considering the team is located in Los Angeles — not exactly snow country.
Where does this self-assurance stem from?
Glavin cites the team’s desire to have fun as what gives them the leg up over the competition.
“We are all about going and having fun,” he said.
Additionally, the team travels to Mammoth for training and practice every weekend beginning in November.
If there is no snow, they rely on indoor training equipment, such as trampolines and indoor agility exercises, to tide them over until they can be out in their element.
Tuesday night was a special evening for the team, as Red Bull threw a screening party for its new film The Art of Flight at Tommy’s Place, complete with a DJ.
The film follows incredibly talented athletes as they snowboard in places such as Alaska and Patagonia. The trails they conquer are not for the average resort skier.
Red Bull hosted the event with the hopes of raising awareness of the team on campus. Though they are by no means small in numbers, their presence is often overlooked, as true weather isn’t commonly experienced in Southern California.
Since there is no snow to remind us of the team, their achievements have gone under the radar.
The team looks to gain a larger following on campus after a successful trip to nationals in a couple weeks.
Heck yeah! Stoked!

Tailback U? USC should probably call itself NFL U. It might actually be more accurate.
The NFL’s annual scouting combine began Tuesday in Indianapolis, where the country’s best talent will meet in hopes of raising its draft stock. Seven Trojans will participate in the combine, among them offensive tackle Matt Kalil, defensive end Nick Perry and tight end Rhett Ellison. Other than Kalil and Perry, no other Trojan is expected to be drafted in the first round.
It might seem like a down year for the Trojans in the draft, but let us not forget that two Trojans who were expected to be first-round picks —  junior quarterback Matt Barkley and junior safety T.J. McDonald — decided to stay in school.
And while names such as Stanford’s Andrew Luck, Baylor’s Robert Griffin III and Alabama’s Trent Richardson are highly touted in the draft, some people are forgetting a key point: throughout the years, the Trojans have dominated the NFL draft.
The numbers don’t lie.
Since center Tony Tonelli became the first USC player to be drafted in 1939, 473 players from USC have been drafted by NFL teams, according to NFL.com. USC sent 75 players as first-round draft picks, and five of them were the first overall selection. Four Trojans went second overall in their respective drafts.
To put this into perspective, let us take the alma mater of one of the presumed top pick in the 2012 draft, Robert Griffin III. His school, Baylor, has had 214 players drafted in its history. That school across town that wears powder blue? They’ve done pretty well for themselves in turning out NFL talent, with 290 players from Westwood being drafted. That’s 183 less than the Trojans have produced.
Alabama, the team that won the 2011 national championship, has had 297 players drafted in its history. The only school that can really compare to USC in terms of draft numbers is the University of Miami, which has had 303 players drafted.
But perhaps you aren’t convinced. Maybe USC gets a lot of people drafted, but how good are they really? Well, USC has 11 players in the NFL Hall of Fame, more than any school in the country. In fact, the Trojans have as many as Oregon and Miami combined. Auburn, the 2010 champions? One. Louisiana State University? Three. The kings of the Big 12, Texas and Oklahoma, have a combined seven between them.
Currently, 55 players that attended USC are on NFL rosters in some capacity. Three Trojans made the Pro Bowl this season, including safety Troy Polamalu, who is likely headed to the Hall of Fame when his career ends.
While this year’s class of Trojans entering the draft might seem top-heavy, one cannot overlook the players that have had great careers in the NFL that weren’t first round selections. Safety Willie Wood, who is in the Hall of Fame, went undrafted in 1960. He did pretty well for himself.
In 2010, the Trojans did not have a player selected in the first round — the first time in quite a few years a Trojan did not sneak into the first 32 picks. Safety Taylor Mays was the highest drafted Trojan that year, going 49th to the San Francisco 49ers. Analysts were shocked to hear that not a single USC player went in the first round. It sounded as if even analysts had gotten used to seeing the Cardinal and Gold being selected early. The fact that it was an “upset” says a lot about the Trojans football program.
When it comes down to it, USC is the most successful program in terms of converting college athletes into NFL players. To deny USC that honor would be an injustice. Sure, not every player who has graced the football field at the Coliseum has turned into a star. But more than any other school in the country, USC has given its players the chance to be NFL stars. Sometimes, that’s all a Trojan really needs.

It might sound premature to say that the Women of Troy are on a roll after winning two games in a row, but given the nature of the past two victories, it’s a claim that is hard to argue against.
After falling to powerhouse Stanford on Feb. 9, USC rallied for a thrilling overtime victory against California in Haas Pavilion, one that will surely give its NCAA tournament chances a boost. After catching its breath, the team returned to the friendly confines of the Galen Center to trounce rival UCLA 66-54.

With the team trailing third-place Arizona State by just one half game, suddenly the poor play that caused a 2-5 stretch from the end of January to early February seems like a distant memory. With its confidence restored, USC now has its sights set on loftier goals.
“We’re fighting to get into the Big Dance,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “We also want to get into that top-four spot [in the conference] to get that first-round bye [in the Pac-12 Tournament].”
USC has every opportunity ahead of them to reach those goals. The first obstacle is an Arizona team that has had its share of struggles. After starting the season 11-1 in nonconference play, the Wildcats have gone just 3-12 against PAC-12 foes and are sitting in last place which is why Arizona presents such a dangerous game. With losses this season to 10th-place Colorado and eighth-place Washington, The Women of Troy have proven to be vulnerable against lower-tier teams.
“We’ve had some losses that we shouldn’t have had and given some games away,” senior guard Ashley Corral said. “At this point, we just need wins.”
In the teams’ first meeting of the season, USC beat the Wildcats 72-67 on January 7 at the McKale Center in Tucson. In that game, the Women of Troy had balanced scoring, with five players reaching double figures. Senior guard Briana Gilbreath led the team with 17 points and nine rebounds.
With only four games remaining in the regular season schedule, the importance of health and depth is amplified as every team is forced to deal with its fair share of bumps and bruises. Cooper is doing his part to make sure his players are ready on game night.
“Coach knows how to take care of our bodies. He changes practice up after games to help us recover,” Gilbreath said. “We all know how important it is to take care of ourselves, especially late in the season.”
For a team that just two weeks ago was .500 in conference play to now have a realistic chance at finishing in second place, it will be important to have healthy bodies to turn a two-game winning streak into something special.
Thursday’s game tips off at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill knows it hasn’t been the easiest season.
Over the last two months, the Trojans have won once — a 62-45 home victory over injury-riddled Utah. They rank last in the Pac-12 in nearly every offensive category from points per game to field goal percentage. And if things keep up, O’Neill’s bunch will likely break a two-decade-long program record for most losses in a single season — a mark set in 1989 when the Trojans finished the year 10-22.
Tough stretch · Freshman guard Alexis Moore and the Trojans are 1-13 in Pac-12 play this year. Two of their last four games are on the road. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“The fact that we’re injured, we have a ceiling as a team,” the third-year coach said.
But with at least five games left to play, including the Pac-12 tournament in mid-March, USC (6-21, 1-13) still has a handful of lasting opportunities to salvage its trying season — at least somewhat.
The Trojans square off against Arizona on Thursday in Tucson.
“Whenever we get out on the court, regardless of our situation, we still have to play hard,” freshman guard Byron Wesley said. “If we have a losing record like we do right now, we’re still going to try to get the win. That’s not going to make us quit.”
There haven’t been a ton of bright spots for USC this season, but Wesley, among other younger players, has proven to be a glimmer of hope in an otherwise forgettable year.
The 6-foot-5 guard has averaged 34.2 minutes per game — about 20 more than O’Neill anticipated he would get last August. But because of injuries that have left the Trojans with six scholarship players healthy enough to suit up, Wesley, who hails from nearby Etiwanda, Calif., has taken on a larger role, particularly on the offensive end.
In the month of February, with sophomore center Dewayne Dedmon and junior forward Aaron Fuller out of the lineup, Wesley has averaged 12.8 points per game, and his on-the-season average of 8.4 points per game pits him seventh among Pac-12 freshmen. In the team’s last game against UCLA, a 64-54 loss, Wesley matched a career-high in scoring with 16 points.
“I need to help our team and that is going to be by scoring,” Wesley said. “[O’Neill’s] telling me to just drive the ball, look for my teammates and try to get them open shots. If not, he wants me to score.”
Similarly, sophomore forward Garrett Jackson has been thrust into a starring role in recent weeks and relied upon for scoring as well. Following Fuller’s season ending injury, Jackson has started the last nine games, averaging 11.2 points per game.
O’Neill has taken notice.
“A lot of individuals have improved,” he said. “Byron Wesley, to me, has become a legitimate scorer. Garett’s averaged double-figures as a starter. Overall, these guys have continued to play hard and continued to fight. That’s what we want them to do.”
At the very least, the Trojans will have to play hard against Arizona (19-9, 10-5) — one of three Pac-12 teams O’Neill called “deserving” of an NCAA tournament at-large berth. The Wildcats, who boast three players averaging double-figures in guard Kyle Fogg, forwards Solomon Hill and Jesse Perry, have won five of their last six games — their lone blemish a nine-point loss at first-place Washington Saturday.
“Those guys have really carried their team,” O’Neill said. “Those guys are all talented guys. They’ve got some veterans who have really anchored their team and done a good job.”
One player who has anchored USC and will be asked to do so for the remainder of the year has been sophomore guard Maurice Jones, who has averaged 38 minutes per game this season, and his 13.7 points per game average ranks first on the team.
But as the Trojans have lost 14 of their last 15 games, the 5-foot-7 guard hasn’t exactly been able to stop the bleeding.
“We just have to keep playing,” Jones said. “We just have to get through it.”
The Wildcats have lost just three times at home all season.
“They don’t lose there very often,” O’Neill said. “It’ll be a challenging place to play.”
Tip-off is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. at the McKale Center and will be televised by Fox Sports Arizona.

The Art of Motion Picture Costume Design exhibit at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising is nothing new. In fact, the school’s museum, located at its Downtown Los Angeles campus, has been putting on the exhibition since 1993. This year, however, marks the 20th anniversary of the program, and the curators pulled out all the stops.
The exhibit features more than 100 costumes from 20 films, including all five of the 2012 Academy Award nominees for best costume design. Pieces of Hollywood memorabilia that are a part of the museum’s permanent collection are also on display.

“It has evolved into an institution,” Nick Verreos, a curator, FIDM professor and former Project Runway contestant, said. “We contact designers and studios throughout the year to have it in place.”
Curators looked for a wide variety of costumes when accumulating pieces for the exhibit, including science fiction, vintage and new garments. Equally important was predicting the Academy Award nominations ahead of time and making them a part of the show.
“They have a sixth sense of knowing the nominations,” Verreos said.
Obtaining influential designs like the 2011 Academy Award winning Alice in Wonderland costume by Colleen Atwood,  which greets viewers at the museum entrance, has become easier over the years.
“It was problematic 18, 19 years ago when no one knew what it was about,” Verreos said. “Now everyone is happy to be a part of it.”
The true standout of the show is the set of five 1920s inspired pieces from The Artist, designed by Mark Bridges, which start the exhibition. The costumes are bound to resonate with fashion-conscious viewers, as the shimmering velvet, fur accents and golden embroidery on the flapper-style dresses are reflected in many of today’s designer collections.
“They are so in,” Verreos said. “Gucci did all 1920s flapper shapes for fall, which is very much The Artist shape.”
Verreos also explained that all the pieces in the movie, except for the hats, were remade versions of vintage fashions. To do this, the cutter laid out the vintage inspirations and examined them before cutting patterns for the new garments. The result is immaculately clean and polished, taking the viewer directly back to the era that inspired the film.
Not all the costumes shown, however, have quite the aesthetic of a modern runway show. Verreos insists that showing the eccentric and often unwearable is part of the artistic aspect of costume design. Many women judge clothing based on what they would like to wear, but the objective of costume design is to make clothes that look like they came from the characters’ closets.
“Fashion is about embracing everything,” Verreos said. “You have to step back and not be personal about it. You have to ask yourself: Why is it jarring? What about it has an effect?”
This academic point of view is something Verreos and other professors instill in their students who use the school’s museum as an educational experience. Curators, in turn, make an effort to display designs by FIDM graduates, many of whom have gone on to design for motion pictures.
“We are grateful that there are FIDM grads that go through the costume design program here and are part of big and small films,” Verreos said. “We are always looking to share the space with them.”
Film buffs and general audiences are sure to enjoy the collection as much as fashion students. Walking through the display is like being a part of Hollywood magic, allowing one to meander through different worlds and eras during the span of a visit.
Though our culture has become fixated on the external image of Hollywood and the actors that put visions into action, this exhibit reminds viewers of the creative forces behind the films we love.
“The red carpet is such an important part of fashion today,” Verreos said. “But I love that costumes are back in the spotlight. There is another red carpet inside the movies.”
The Art of Motion Picture Costume Design will be on display through April 28 and admission is free to the public.

When people think of comics, most unfortunately hold very dated and cliché views of the medium. That’s why so many articles and superhero movie reviews have the trite words “Pow!” “Wham!” “Bam!” headlines. This has some unfortunate consequences: Parents taking their kids to very mature films like The Dark Knight or Watchmen, for example, because they’re comic books, they must be for kids — or so the thinking goes.
For the most part, the general public still has the perception that comic books are kids’ stuff. And every so often there’s a media controversy over violence and death in comics, or things like breastfeeding on the cover of Brian K. Vaughan’s new series Saga. Never mind the fact that many comics are written for and labeled as appropriate only for mature audiences.
If you’re letting a 10-year-old read PunisherMAX or Criminal, maybe you should reconsider your parenting skills.
But it’s more than just some exhausting, foolish controversy. The cultural perception of comics essentially consists of most people writing off the art form entirely because they think everything is like the 1960s Batman television show.
I still get odd looks or get dismissively called a nerd — and expletive-laden variations of the same — when I admit to reading comics; the basic idea being anyone over the age of 12 is weird for doing so.
No matter how many well-made, smart comic book movies or television shows come out, that stereotype won’t seem to go away. And that’s a stereotype from almost half a century ago, when major censorship limited comics to absurd, cheesy storylines and writing. That censorship has eased dramatically, and now comics are telling stories far removed from that “Zap!” mentality.
Sure, there are superheroes and big bust-up fights in comic books, but there are also political dramas, coming-of-age stories and horror. Comic books are a medium, not a genre. Unfortunately, in a world where ‘comic book movie’ equals ‘superhero movie,’ that idea isn’t getting across. Road to Perdition and A History of Violence are also comic book movies. Where are the dismissive comments on those films for their origins?
At the same time, the comic industry itself, whether from fans or creators, is facing the inverse of that problem. Trying to get over the kid stereotype, and still bearing grim and gritty post-Watchmen elements, those involved in comic books are constantly talking about the maturity and the absence of childlike qualities of series they read. If a series is well-written and deals with intense subjects, that’s great, but it’s this kind of knee-jerk defensive reaction that undermines the argument for a book. And those aren’t even the worst problems.
Comic book sales, even with new initiatives and the digital market, sell around 200,000 copies. The public’s exposure to comics is on the rise thanks to the prominence of comic book-based shows and the popularity of Comic-Con, but that isn’t translating into comic sales, in part because of the cultural divide mixed with the inaccessibility for younger readers. If they alienate any potential new blood, the industry will inevitably shrink and eventually die.
Sure, major and independent companies have all-ages books out there, but they’re often ignored in favor of the latest dark series where someone dies.
This isn’t to say that comics need to stop what they’re doing and suddenly focus on books to draw younger readers in. And it doesn’t mean that the general public should suddenly think the comic industry is darker than the love child of Six Feet Under and Taken. But things do need to change.
This sort of absolutist perception from all parties hurts the industry.
For the general public, they’re essentially disregarding and generalizing an entire medium. That’s like saying you don’t watch television because all shows are like American Idol. They aren’t, and you’re missing out on quality writing if you do.
So here’s an idea. Let’s stop with the clichés. Comics are not washed-up remnants dripping in corny puns. And comic book makers and fans, let’s be more inclusive. If we love the medium, we need to support it, and that means showing people the wide spectrum of comics available, not shouting from one extreme of it.
If a certain comic series seems interesting, read it. Don’t worry if people think it’s for kids. And if it is a series written for them, share it with a younger friend.

great article
I wonder if the interest i things comic book aren’t being translated into more sells because as a medium it’s harder to find comics then it is music, film or video games.   Look at the later which has the same stigmas as comics (being seen as just kid stuff from who aren’t fans of the medium that lead to people shocked when they let their kid play/read the stuff  not made for kids)  but they sell much better then comics.  Why?   Because people can find buy them in many places where comics have limited their sell largely to the  comic book shop.  Sure there are video game stores but I can also buy games on wallmart or on my phone.
and the comment that comics shouldn’t stop what they are doing and start producing comics for kids.  I think that is true, in fact one of the problems comics have right now started in the 80’s with the success of books like Watchmen and Dark Knight Returns people seemed to have thought that they should stop (or greatly limit) the comics they made aimed at kids and started to make them aimed at adult.  Instead of widing the market to have things for kid and adult but their was a shift to make the things that where once for kids for adults.
I run a very successful business (not a comic shop) based on the Batman mythology, and have an entire bookshelf in my house devoted to comic books. I feel no stigmas attached to me.
This is a very self-opinionated piece with slanted opinions towards the ‘worst’ the industry has to offer… I was literally waiting for some mention of the many all-ages books, but it never appeared.
There are the Muppets and Incredibles from Marvel – Teeny Titans from DC – not to mention the many great licenses from other publishers.
This focused solely on portion of the market, without over-viewing the whole market in general.

work is, although you may not do it.”
— Philip Levine, “What Work Is”
 
Sometimes, it’s best to just sit back and listen to a master — and that’s exactly the case with legendary author and Poet Laureate of the United States Philip Levine.
Born and raised in working-class Detroit, Levine has found inspiration and poignancy in the most ordinary of places, gathering acclaim and a Pulitzer Prize for his works.

It’s only a couple days before the 84th Annual Academy Awards, which means another rush of last-minute speculation about who those iconic golden statues will go to.
In the zone · The professionally renowned USC professor Drew Casper discusses various film styles and techniques with his cinema students. - Eddie Kim | Daily Trojan
Esteemed — and perhaps notorious — USC School of Cinematic Arts professor Drew Casper is no stranger to the awards, having followed it closely over the years.
Though he describes the 2011- early 2012 season as “one of the worst years for movies ever,” Casper was generous enough to share his thoughts on this year’s nominees over a leisurely lunch at Parkside. Here’s what he had to say.
On writing 
Adapted from a novel by Hawaii native Kaui Hart Hemmings and written by director Alexander Payne as well as Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, The Descendants screenplay has garnered plenty of acclaim, even snagging USC’s Scripter Award.
Casper remains unimpressed.
“The Descendants was so soft, so mushy. Where’s the edge? Election, Citizen Ruth, Sideways — Payne’s other films had such black humor, such a sharpness,” he says, furrowing his brow. “But people want mush, I guess. Coming from Payne, and based on my expectations, it’s a step down.”
Though he believes that The Descendants will win the Oscar for best adapted screenplay, Casper doesn’t believe it’s the most deserving.
“Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is the best-written film of the year. It’s heart-pounding and interesting, and it’s so, so sensitive to [author John] le Carré’s vision,” Casper says.
He pauses and shakes his head.
“But no one went to see it, so it won’t win for best adapted screenplay,” Casper continues. “It’s a movie where you have to pay attention. It demands it. And audiences don’t really do that these days.”
As for best original writing, Casper is willing to bet on a true film veteran, even if others — including Bridesmaids, which Casper is quick to praise as “genuinely hilarious, as well as honest” — did catch his eye.
“[Woody] Allen will win with Midnight In Paris. He’s so well-known, and the movie made money. I’m a little underwhelmed by it compared to some of his other works, but money matters,” Casper says. “Take [Allen’s 1994] Bullets Over Broadway — it was a commercial flop, and didn’t get the recognition it deserves.”
On best picture and direction
“The Artist is very simple, but put together in a very sophisticated way,” Casper says. “You’ve seen it all before, in movies like Singin’ in the Rain and Sunset Boulevard, but it’s completely charming, even if it’s referential. Is it a great movie? No. It’s not a classic. But I think it’ll win best picture.”
Aside from the direction of Michel Hazanavicius with The Artist, Casper also lauds the most recent work of film legend Martin Scorsese, Hugo, noting that it’s “one of the best uses of 3-D ever” and “stylistically amazing.”
But any student who’s taken a class with Casper knows that, though his praise of films can be glowing, his criticism is equally intense. As expected, he has some choice words for certain nominations.
“The Tree of Life,” Casper says, head craning forward for emphasis. “What masturbation! Just repeating the same point, the same feeling over and over again. It’s pretentious as all hell. The cinematography is terrific, admittedly, but I think the photography in The Artist is better. It really shows off the elegance of black and white.”
On acting
Though there are many standout female performances that have been nominated this year, for Casper, it’s all about Meryl Streep.
“You can’t touch Meryl. She is amazing. The way she’s able to transform from role to role, being a fashion b-tch in [The Devil Wears Prada] and now in The Iron Lady, it’s incredible,” he says.
“But I don’t think she’ll win,” he adds with a frown. “I think they’ll give it to [The Help’s Viola Davis]. Did you see that article in the Times on Sunday?” he asks, referencing a recent Los Angeles Times study. “Voters will [have gone] for that.”
The study found that 94 percent of Academy voters are white, and that 77 percent are male. Casper points out that voters could have reacted to that revelation by “going for” the African-American Davis.
As for the male performances, Casper dismisses the buzz around George Clooney, noting it as “the same thing he’s done in every film.”  He was impressed by others, however.
“[Jean Dujardin] in The Artist: very fine performance. It was really strong, well-acted. Gary Oldman [in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]: also a great performance, but he doesn’t stand a chance. No one watched the movie,” he says.
On movies
What is art? What should art do? These difficult questions are swiftly addressed by Casper, who says art — including movies — should “move you on a deep emotional level.”
“I like it when a movie disturbs me — not necessarily in a frightening way, but with feeling and emotion. Singin’ In the Rain is so joyful, and it makes me feel like I’m walking on air — it changes my entire perception of life,” Casper says with a grin.
A point often made in Casper’s lectures is that films are in decline, and here he doesn’t shy away from addressing modern audiences.
“Unfortunately, the Golden Age of films is over. People don’t want something to think about — they want sensation. People go to a movie for the same reason they go on a roller-coaster,” he says.
For Casper, the magic of movies lies not in special effects or crazy premises but in human emotion.
“What people don’t remember is that the most spectacular thing that can happen on-screen is a person talking to a person,” he says, eyes alight with excitement. “That’s what the movies are really about.”
Best article I have seen in a long time in the DT.  Informative, interesting, and humorous.  Sure beats other articles about your favorite foods….
This is exactly the type of stuff the DT should be doing with its entertainment coverage. Great interview and writing.
This is amazing. Bravo, DT!

Technically speaking, sarcasm isn’t a word that ends in ‘-ism.’ I realize readers care deeply about my adherence to my column’s theme. Please forgive me. It’s just that sarcasm is everywhere.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
This form of humor is especially popular with blasé college students. Did someone just recount a mundane anecdote? Cool story, bro. Are you about to study for your midterms? Have fun raging at Club Leavey.
The USC Memes Facebook page can thank sarcasm for much of the page’s success. If you don’t know what the page is, congratulations for managing to stay off Facebook for that long.
One meme — the one where Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka looks especially condescending — features the following lines: “You say you won’t drink that much ever again? Let’s talk about that tomorrow morning.”
Another meme mocks one DPS officer’s obvious warning: “If you get hit by a car, it will hurt.” It’s hard to hear something like that and respond candidly.
Even Student Affairs recognizes our love of sarcasm. Last Monday, USC Spectrum hosted writers from The Onion, that bastion of journalistic integrity. Unsurprisingly, the event was well-attended.
Nevertheless, sarcasm proves a rule college students tend to disregard: There is such a thing as too much of a good thing.
One idiom calls sarcasm the lowest form of wit. That’s no reason to look down on it; one could say that Jersey Shore is the lowest form of television programming, but few people are going to look at you funny if you make a joke about Snooki.
Still, would you watch Jersey Shore every day? I hope not.
Along that vein, think about every time you’ve responded to something with a sarcastic comment. I’m sure it took you tons of thought to say the opposite of what you meant. I know I’m having a really hard time injecting sarcasm into this article.
Sometimes, sarcasm isn’t just about humorous flourish. It can be a substitute for well-thought-out humor. It can even be a reflexive response.
Sarcasm becomes problematic when people use it to respond to events they actually care about. Think of a roommate that says you’ve been really organized as she steps over a pile of your books. Using sarcasm in this manner might make you sound less uptight, but it also prevents people from understanding what you actually want.
Sarcastic humor is especially hard to decipher in the age of electronic communication. To those of you who have never experienced the dread of sending a sarcastic text and realizing the recipient might think you’re being serious — well, good for you.
The same goes for social media. I’ve seen plenty of students post sarcastic messages such as “life is rough” under instagram photos of pristine beaches, dramatic skylines and famous monuments. On one hand, we’re all dying to hear about how cool your life is, but on the other hand, you’re putting rubbing alcohol on the wounds of people who are genuinely going through hard times.
Signing onto Facebook doesn’t require you to suddenly become considerate of 500 peoples’ feelings, but all the same — if you’re going to brag, why not go all out? Just brag. Own it.
If each brand of humor were a spice, sarcasm would be salt: It makes almost anything a little tastier, but too much of it can ruin a dish that would’ve been fine on its own.
 
Maya Itah is a senior majoring in communication. Her column “Tackling the ‘-isms’” runs every other Thursday.
Similar to sarcasm, but differing in having no humorous intent, is disguise-by-inversion (term my awkward invention). Examples abound: for example, calling the military arm of the American Empire (forever adventuring abroad, to the misfortune of American taxpayers, the residents of their theaters of operation, and many of the soldiers themselves) the “Defense Department.” George Orwell immortalized this in 1984 with slogans such as “Freedom is slavery.”
My favorite, of course (you were waiting for this), is the Anti-Defamation League, whose sole business today is defamation with scurrilous labels such as “Anti-Semite,” and “Holocaust Denier.”
By the way, application of these labels to people having no such inclinations or motivations is VERY insensitive. It hurts our feelings.
General sarcasm about life and events can take the tension out of a situation for a good laugh and fun.  For example, getting wet in the rain can be funny if someone says  ” Our personality is all wet “. 
On the other hand, personal sarcasm about someone’s meal can be unfortunate, for example, ” We need to eat with heavy, weighted spoons to get exercise while we eat the ice cream”.
No, students don’t overuse sarcasm. They, like, overuse, like, y’know? basically, like, y’know, is what they, like, overuse.
Like, y’know?

What are you going to do after college? For many of us, this is the most anxiety-inducing question we could ever be asked by our peers, professors, advisers and, worst of all, our parents. We have all heard stories about friends or roommates or siblings moving back in with Mom and Dad and settling for a job at the local fast food joint to pay off their student loans after graduation. No one wants to be that student.

This is why the USC Career Center organizes and hosts a large variety of career events on campus, the largest being the career fairs. USC is an institution with an outstanding number of schools and programs of study. Students — especially juniors, seniors and graduate students — need to know that there are job opportunities awaiting them after college that fit their individual interests.
The Career Center hosts two large career fairs on campus each year: one during the fall semester and one during the spring semester. Invitations to participate in the career fairs are sent out to company representatives who have posted job openings on ConnectSC, USC’s career database. According to Carl Martellino, the executive director at the Career Center, 12,000–14,000 employers have posted job openings on ConnectSC in the past year. Of those employers, 170 came to the Fall 2011 career fair; 180 employers came to the spring 2012 career fair that took place on Feb. 9, making it “one of the largest career fairs at USC,” Martellino said.
As an undergraduate job seeker at the Spring 2012 Career Fair, I learned, however, that the fair is not always, well, fair.
The most recent campus career fair did not provide equal opportunities for students from all major fields of study. Most of the available job opportunities were in business, marketing, accounting and other finance-related fields.
Of course, students from the Marshall School of Business probably saw the event as a gold mine. But where did that leave the students from the other schools on campus? Martellino explained that many schools, such as the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, hold their own separate career events for students in those fields.
What is truly perplexing, however, is that the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences — the school with the longest list of majors — does not have its own career fair.
There are workshops and special panels for students belonging to this school, but there is no fair. Dornsife students depend entirely on events organized by the Career Center.
Martellino said that liberal arts students have the most flexibility at the career fairs.
“If you’re an English major, you may not plan on being an English teacher,” Martellino said. “You may decide you’re going to go into marketing, or some business area, or go on to law school.”
Martellino makes a valid point. Some students do wish to branch out from their major and pursue careers that differ from what they’ve been studying in school.
There are still many students, however, who want jobs that are specific to their major. They didn’t spend the last few years of their lives studying apples because they’re interested in working with oranges.
In addition to the trend of business employers, it was also apparent that the employers at the career fair preferred graduating seniors and graduate students.
But what about the rest of us? In the words of several employers I spoke to, including the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health: “Come talk to us next year.”
There were also a number of companies at the career fair that were based in regions outside of California.
For example, the Urban Teacher Center only had positions in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Such distant positions require thousands of miles of traveling, room and board and an array of miscellaneous living expenses.
This might not be an issue for some students, but if I could afford an out-of-state adventure, I wouldn’t have been at the career fair.
Perhaps all major departments should organize small career fairs so that all students are accommodated. They should invite more representatives from local organizations that are willing to consider students at multiple points in their college careers.
We’re in Los Angeles, one of the largest cities in the country. The job opportunities are here. Lead the way, USC.

WHAT?!?! There are not a lot of of jobs for liberal arts majors out there??  I am for one shocked!!! ….
The reason companies ask for you to come back in a year is they are there to hire full time employees, namely graduating seniors who are about to become available to work. Why would a company hire someone for a job when they couldn’t actually work?
The example company recruiting for positions in cities out of state is also another /facepalm. Is it really a surprise if you accept a job offer in a city out of state that it will require you to travel there, rent an apartment/house, and pay for living expenses? That is part of moving…somewhere else!
Can’t tell if continuation from sarcasm article, or if trying to prove futile point?

Former USC left tackle Matt Kalil gears up for the 2012 NFL draft amid rumors of a top-10 draft pick. Kalil, who elected to leave USC a year early in favor of a career in the NFL, begins training at the scouting combine today with roughly 320 other professional potentials.
He follows in the footsteps of his older brother Ryan Kalil, who now plays center for the Carolina Panthers. Kalil is no stranger to following in his brother’s footsteps, as both played football at Servite High School and at USC.
“Obviously, I’ve still got to perform and be a good player, but, it’s been a lot easier going to college and going to the combine like I am right now, and having someone who’s already done everything. Not a lot of people have that,” Kalil told the Los Angeles Times.
The combine will run from today to next Tuesday, and provide an opportunity for hundreds of NFL scouts, executives, and coaches to take a look at the latest crop of professional hopefuls. The Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, home to this year’s Super Bowl, will host the combine.
Kalil will stand under the shadow of quarterbacks Andrew Luck (Stanford) and Heisman winner Robert Griffin III (Baylor), but this does not diminish his chances of being a top-10 pick. He and Riley Reiff (Iowa) are slated as the top tackles at the combine.

Prometheus, the film that brought Ridley Scott and Michael Fassbender together, isn’t due for release until June 8, but the director and actor have already agreed upon their next project together.
The Counselor, an originally screenplay from acclaimed writer, Cormac McCarthy, will reunite the duo together.
The film is being labeled as “No Country for Old Men on steroids” and is concerned with a respected lawyer who tries dabbling in the drug business, only to be faced with extreme consequences.
The Counselor is scheduled to start production on May 1.
Michael Fassbender recently starred in Jane Eyre, X-Men: First Class, A Dangerous Method, Haywire, as well as Shame, for which he received considerable praise and won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival. The young actor is scheduled to reunite with another director this year, Steve McQueen, who directed him in Hunger and Shame, as they reteam for Twelve Years A Slave.
