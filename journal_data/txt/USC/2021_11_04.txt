USC graduate student Kayla Love and her fiancé, Khari Jones Jr., welcomed their daughter on June 27 after an emergency home birth. After returning from the hospital later that night, the couple was surprised with the arrival of a social worker and 10 Los Angeles Police Department and Department of Public Safety officers at their on-campus family housing unit. 
According to the couple, the officers claimed they were conducting a wellness check but did not provide a reason at the time. The check escalated as the officers drew their guns in the couple’s apartment. In the following days and weeks, the incident drew media attention as Love and Jones spoke out about the unjust breach of privacy they said the check and subsequent checks caused. 
The Black Student Assembly released a statement Oct. 20 about Love and her family having to vacate the unit under eviction threats. The statement also indicated Love had been pressured to leave her doctoral program at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. BSA shared a petition started by the family, tagged with #StandForLoveJones, that calls for an end to the “retaliation and unethical treatment” by terminating all parties involved in endangering them, as well as providing reasonable supportive measures such as compensation and removal of academic holds. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Love and Jones said they visited the hospital after the home birth, which concluded in with the newborn’s successful medical treatment and evaluation. The couple declined for doctors to draw their daughter’s blood at the hospital, stating that they would prefer for their child to be seen by a private physician. Love said she is very particular about the way that blood is drawn, so she wanted to ensure that everything was done properly through her provider. 
After Love and Jones declined medical evaluation further than basic height and weight checks, Jones said the doctor contacted risk management, who sent three sheriffs to the hospital to confront the couple. According to Jones, this encounter didn’t go any further, as the family left promptly after of the sheriffs’ arrival. 
“All I did was pick my daughter up and we walked away,” Jones said. “I know my rights and also just the history of [officers] using their guns. I don’t see why they felt the need to surround me while I have my daughter in my hands.”
For the wellness check at the couple’s apartment later that night, Love said the social worker, with 10 officers in possession of guns behind her, attempted to enter the unit despite Jones’ resistance.
“[Jones was] explaining to [the social worker] that I had a medical document that said I’m not to make any personal or business decisions within the next 24 hours,” Love said. “What I need to be doing right now is getting rest.”
Despite their explanations, Love said the officers eventually “forced their way in,” subsequently taking Jones’ cell phone away and detaining him by moving him to a separate room of the unit, away from Love. The social worker then asked Love to answer a set of questions, which she refused to do.
“The officers were saying, ‘Well if you answer these questions, we can all go home.’ Like, you’re not convincing me to answer something if you don’t have a reason for why you’re here,” Love said.
The petition started by Love and Jones mentioned how the officers threatened Jones during the check while he was holding his child. The couple “[is] taking legal action and petitioning against all parties involved in multiple unethical wellness checks,” read the petition.
In a statement issued on July 15, the LAPD wrote that only Jones was faced with weapons during the encounter. The statement read that “the male adult was briefly detained” but Love and the baby “were not in the same room” as him. 
Jones was let go after about an hour, Love said, and the officers left soon after. However, the couple said their interactions with DPS and the LAPD about their child didn’t end there. Officers came a total of four times for these checks, which Jones said happened because DPS allowed them to do so. 
“DPS doesn’t actually protect the wellbeing of their students,” Jones said. “They basically tell us that if LAPD does come back, [they] will allow them to stay.”
Love said the residential assistant told her and Jones that the repeated officer interactions at their family housing unit were grounds for eviction. The couple was eventually issued an eviction notice: Not because of officer presence, but because they hadn’t paid for the unit. Love said she was put in a situation where she was trying to pay for housing while relocating and she could not afford to do both. 
“[USC Housing Director Christopher Posiglione and Student Affairs Vice President Winston Crisp] put me in a situation where I’m trying to pay for housing and we’re also trying to relocate and can’t afford to do both,” Love said. 
Love said she was restricted from enrolling in her program, which meant she was unable to receive the graduate student stipend that she would use to pay for housing. After reaching out to Student Affairs to see if any emergency funds were available to help support her family, Love said she could only be offered counseling.
The University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan that while it is “unable to share any details about her situation or the university’s response due to student privacy laws,” the University is “deeply concerned when any student experiences any kind of trauma.” 
The statement directed students to private and confidential support resources, including Student Equity and Inclusion Programs and Counseling and Mental Health. 
Since the incident, the couple has continued to push for reform within DPS and the medical industry through their petition. 
“Many of us are tired of the destruction of families and our health through the force of unnecessary treatment, medical kidnapping and the limited justice, if any,” their petition read.
The petition also calls for the “appropriate termination of all parties involved in endangering Kayla Love, Khari Jones, and their daughter Fari Love-Jones,” and advocates for compensation for the couple and the removal of academic holds and fees presently facing Love. Additionally, the couple said they want USC to better protect its students by making a change in the way that wellness checks are conducted. 
“That really was a life or death situation,” Love said. “Wellness checks do not need to be performed in that manner and USC needs to be held accountable.”
The University wrote in its statement to the Daily Trojan that it is aware of the issues raised by Love and her family about her experience with the LAPD and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services but did not provide further comment.  
“Those governmental agencies operate totally separately from USC, so we are unable to talk about whatever decisions they made according to their policies and procedures,” the University’s statement read. 
DPS did not respond to the Daily Trojan in time for publication.

Former 2020 Democratic Party presidential candidate and 2021 New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Andrew Yang spoke about his advocacy for universal basic income, his creation of the Forward Party and his previous campaigns at a Zoom event Wednesday presented by the USC Speakers Committee and the Political Student Assembly. 
Jonathan Wong, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration, and So Jung An, a freshman majoring in business administration, moderated the event.  
Wong and Jung An are both part of the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, a programming branch under USG. The duo were selected to moderate the event through an interview process.
Jung An has been following Yang since his 2020 presidential campaign and said she was excited to ask him questions.
“Meeting him, not really in person but through Zoom, definitely [made] me starstruck,” Jung An said. “I was very nervous to meet him as well … because throughout the presidential campaign and also politics, I did look up to Andrew Yang because he is an Asian American in politics.” 
Yang discussed universal basic income, a central theme in his 2020 presidential campaign that made him unique compared to other contenders. His campaign played a role in popularizing the policy, he said.
“When I started running for president, approximately 27% of Americans agreed with the idea of universal basic income,” Yang said. “Now, as we’re having this conversation tonight, 65% of Americans are for it.”
Yang also said he feels a connection to the American youth, who he said were compelled by his earnest goals to help improve America. 
“I want to try and create a path so that you all can take your energy and vision for the future and help make it a reality as quickly as possible,” Yang said. “The country needs that more than ever, and hopefully my generation can serve as a bridge to yours.”
When Wong asked about his 2020 presidential run, Yang said he was motivated most of all by Donald Trump becoming president. Trump’s election showed that the system needed to change, Yang said.
“I had no intention of ever [running for president],” he said. “I got activated by Donald Trump’s victory in 2016, where he won and I thought, ‘Wow, things are getting worse than I thought faster than I thought.’” 
Thinking back on the campaign, Yang said he remembers Iowa fondly and emphasized his ability to connect with the Iowan people on a personal level.
“There was a point when we were riding high — we did raise $40 million. For context, that was in the last quarter — we raised about half of what Bernie raised, so we had enough to compete,” Yang said. “I was number one in ‘who they want to have a beer with,’ number one in ‘cares about people like me.’”
Yang said he felt he lost because of a lack of political experience and the perception that he was not the best candidate to beat Trump.
“The qualities that held me back were ‘has the right experience’ and ‘can defeat Donald Trump,’” Yang said. “Because if you rewind to 2020 the entire issue was, ‘who can defeat Donald Trump?’ It’s why I believe Joe Biden ended up being the nominee because voters felt like he was the most likely to win against Donald Trump.”
Yang said he felt his campaign was able to mobilize people who previously were not involved in politics because they felt he was a genuine human being and loved his campaign ideas, such as universal basic income.
Yang left the Democratic Party on Oct. 4 and founded the Forward Party, which he hopes will minimize partisanship in American politics by presenting an alternative to the two party status quo. 
“I would say that the system should not be designed such that our lawmakers are spending up to half their time just trying to raise money to stay in office or help their party compete,” Yang said. “So, the system has its own incentive structures now that make it so that the people are not being served as well as we should be.”
After the moderators asked questions, students submitted questions via the Zoom Q&A function. Aidan Miltner, a junior majoring in applied and computational mathematics, asked Yang about how the Forward Party would combat polarization between Democrats and Republicans.
“I thought he gave a great answer, outlining  how he just wants to break apart the whole system of politics in America, just giving everyone equal opportunities to achieve the goals that they want to achieve and not have politics or economics be a barrier to that,” Miltner said. “[I] was happy to hear his thoughts on the new progressive movement.”

Women’s tennis returns to action this weekend with three simultaneous tournaments, headlined by the ITA Fall National Championships, where No. 18 senior Salma Ewing, No. 56 junior Eryn Cayetano and redshirt freshman Snow Han will compete.
The Fall National Championships will take place at the Barnes Tennis Center in San Diego, Calif. The tournament is the last of the fall collegiate tennis season and will focus on individual tournaments as opposed to school-versus-school dual matches. The 32 singles players and 32 doubles pairs compete in men’s and women’s brackets. Elsewhere, Trojans will compete at the Jack Kramer Invitational in Rolling Hills, Calif. and the Thunderbird Invitational in Tempe, Ariz. at Arizona State University. 
“One of my priorities was to have everyone on our team competing regularly this fall and in particular, to finish up fall season,” Head Coach Alison Swain wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It should be a fun and exciting weekend with so many of our team competing. Our team is really focused and united right now.”
Ewing, Cayetano and Han all enter the Championships off the back of strong results. Most recently, Han reached the semifinal of the ITA Southwest Regional tournament, where she won her first four matches by a combined score of 49 games to her opponents’ 13 before defeating the No. 44 and No. 9 ranked opponents in the Round of 16 and the quarterfinals. Han also earned Co-Champion honors on the singles side at USC’s Women of Troy tournament hosted in October. Ewing reached the quarterfinals at the Southwest Regional as well, only falling in a close-fought three-setter against San Diego No. 30 ranked redshirt junior Solymar Colling 6-4, 4-6, 1-6.
“The players know exactly what they each need to work on,” Swain wrote. “At the same time, they are enjoying being out on court together — so the atmosphere has been focused but also very enthusiastic at practices.”
Cayetano only competed on the doubles side at the Southwest Regional, but turned heads with a semifinal berth at the ITA All-American Championships. En route to the final four, Cayetano won in straight sets 6-0, 6-3 against the tournament’s 2nd seed, No. 3 sophomore Janice Tjen of Pepperdine. Cayetano also won the singles championship and her doubles flight with Grace Piper, her freshman partner, at the Fall Ranked Spotlight. On the singles side, she upset the nation’s No. 23 and No. 16 players, NC State senior Alana Smith and Miami sophomore Isabella Pfennig, respectively. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Cayetano said that “doing pretty [well] in the fall has given [her] the confidence for this season and the spring,” following her strong results across multiple tournaments.
Cayetano describes herself as “the most physical tennis player on the court” against any opponent, “someone who has the most grit and … is just willing to put everything on the line and do whatever it takes to win.” 
USC will return to action late January, with the indoor season and a series of non-conference matches before Pac-12 play opens on Feb. 25 against UCLA. 
“Team goals are first and foremost driven by our players,” Swain wrote. “At the same time, I want to see improvement from the [last] two weeks and take each match one at a time and still be competing deep into the weekend.”

Are you a friend of Dorothy’s? Whether you are or not, Dorothy’s Friends Theatre Company is a wonderful hub of creative talent open to all. 
Started by a group of friends who felt a lack of representation within the School of Dramatic Arts, DFTC’s mission is to create positive, queer and empowering theater, according to MJ Adamson, a sophomore majoring in stage management and the company’s production manager. 
“Our entire purpose is to create a safe space for queer individuals and allies to have an environment of like-minded people where they feel seen and protected,” Adamson said. “It really goes to being able to see people on stage who are like you, and I think that’s something that is really difficult growing up whether you’re queer or of a minority race or of a specific gender, so I think that’s something that we really try to emphasize and uphold.” 
The name of the company dates back to pre-World War II, where the term “a friend of Dorothy’’ was used as a euphemism for discussing sexual orientation when such topics weren’t openly discussed in society. Originating from Judy Garland’s role as Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz,” it was a quick and safe way for members of the LGBTQ+ community to identify each other. 
“These days, it is much easier for us to be open about and proud of our identities, but we want to honor the legacy of those who came before us in everything that we do,” the company’s website reads. “If you’re a friend of Dorothy, you’re safe with us.”
DFTC’s repertoire includes important and notable queer pieces including “Fun Home”, “She Kills Monsters” and “Abraham Lincoln’s Big Gay Dance Party.” Adamson said the pitch process for DFTC, which is open to all students at USC, allows the organization to stay open to plays of all sorts. 
The collaborative process requires approvals from the literature team, artistic directors and executive board. Mixing newly written pieces with preexisting works, DFTC hopes to increase the number of shows they do each semester, according to Adamson. 
“Currently, it’s more USC-based. We’re fairly new, we’ve been around for about five years, Adamson said. “Currently, our focus is more of reaching the USC environment and making that a community and home for individuals before we start branching out, but in the future, I think definitely once we are more progressed and once we’ve found more of the community we’re trying to reach, we’d love to reach out more [in Los Angeles].”
Although the pandemic changed how the company work on shows, it allowed the group to experiment and be inventive in their approach. Even amid social-distancing rules, DFTC was able to produce “Sibylla” in April 2021, an audio drama written by Lane Kittle-Kamp, a senior majoring in classics. 
Now returning to campus, DFTC is taking what it learned over its remote work and transitioning back to normal with a fall cabaret lined up next. 
“So much of theater arts is based on human connection,” said Sarah Showich, a sophomore majoring in theatre who serves as the head of social media and PR.
“Right now, we’re in the middle of production for our fall cabaret and ‘Rocky Horror Shadow’ cast, and on the horizon, we’re looking at branching out more,” said Samantha Vargas, current interim president and treasurer of DFTC.
Vargas said DFTC hopes to collaborate with interested students at USC to feature original work and encourages contributors and participants in the company to be authentic in their storytelling and acting. 
“I think that one of the best ways to be inclusive and create representation is to represent yourself,” Vargas said. “Write your story, write what you know, write what’s true and what has meaning to you because not everyone is going to feel represented by your work but at least one person will. The goal is not to try and represent everyone but to represent people that are real.” 
DFTC is different from any of the other theater opportunities available for students on campus because they provide a space for queer individuals, specifically, to gain valuable professional experience.
“We have this special privilege of being able to grant not only a theatrical community but also to really create the space for queer creatives to get hands-on experience and to get their stories told,” Showich said. “And if we can empower the people we work with on the production teams and actors and audiences by showing them some representation that they might not have in other places, that’s so special to me and I think that that’s something that’s so special to DFTC.”
DFTC is dedicated to providing a community for students and the goal is to continue to grow as a presence on campus, according to Adamson. 
 “We’re really interested in becoming a household name, not in the way that we want publicity but in the way that we want, as queer individuals, as people who have felt ostracized and who haven’t always had a home, to have people come to USC and know that DFTC is a place for them to go,” Adamson said.

Being a first-generation student, feeling like you don’t belong and overcoming mental illness are some of the topics covered in “Teenager Therapy,” a podcast focused on the struggles that come with being a teenager. In less than four years, “Teenager Therapy” has reached over 60,000 followers on Instagram and received over 4 million likes on TikTok.
In 2018, Anaheim native Gael Aitor came up with the concept for “Teenager Therapy” after listening and relating to a podcast by YouTuber Casey Neistat called “Couples Therapy.”
“I wished that there was something like this podcast for teenagers,” Aitor said. “I thought it would be interesting to hear about issues that teens don’t usually open up about. There was nothing else like it so I decided to make it myself.” 
Aitor reached out to four of his friends — Isaac Hurtado, Kayla Suarez, Thomas Pham and Mark Hugo — to pitch his idea. Suarez and Pham now attends USC while Hurtado is at the University of California, Berkeley and Hugo and Aitor are located in their hometown of Anaheim.
With his friends on board as co-hosts, the group met up in a bedroom and recorded the podcast’s first episode where they discussed why they created the podcast.  
Aitor took on the responsibility of editing the podcast as well as promoting content through social media.
“I asked my friends to be a part of the podcast, but I didn’t necessarily ask them to take on all the responsibilities that came with it,” Aitor said.
After consistently posting material at least once per week, “Teenager Therapy” gained an increasing amount of attention. Meme and niche accounts on Instagram reached out to promote their podcast, said Pham, a freshman majoring in business administration. 
“There was a new, untouched market for Gen-Z podcasts, so many people were interested in what we had to say or how it was going to work,” Pham said.
“Teenager Therapy” continues to rise in popularity for its relatable and honest content, gaining attention from students, teens and celebrities worldwide. Nicole Tisnes,  a freshman majoring in  public relations, discovered the podcast while scrolling through TikTok. Although Tisnes does not often consistently listen to podcasts, she said she does make time to play an episode of “Teenager Therapy” every month.
“I like that they are very in touch with what teenagers want to listen to and talk about,” Tisnes said. “They are speaking from a teenager’s perspective, and that makes their content so fresh and relatable.” 
Tisnes said that some of her favorite episodes from the podcast are “Listen When You Feel Alone #6” and “Why Birthdays Make Us Sad.” With Tisnes’ birthday coming up and her being away from home, she said she related to the podcasters’ complex feelings about getting older.
The podcasters were very supportive of one another through the highs and lows as they began to build their brand, Pham said. 
“We were never directly faced with judgment from others, but it was always clear that people around us had their doubts about the podcast’s success,” Pham said. “Sometimes, people would be passive-aggressive and try to poke fun at it which was a little uncomfortable.” 
Despite others’ doubts, “Teenager Therapy” has reached major milestones such as being featured on Wired, The New York Times and having a fair share of celebrity guests featured on their episodes. 
“It honestly feels unreal. I always had a hard time wrapping around the idea that my face is literally on The New York Times, which was something I have always dreamed of achieving yet never thought would be possible,” Pham said. “It feels amazing to know the impact of the work we’re doing.”
“Teenager Therapy” has also reached an audience beyond teens and students. In October 2020, the group of co-hosts received an unknown email notifying them of a potential celebrity guest. After two suspenseful days, the podcasters were notified that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were fans of the podcast and wanted to be guests on an episode. 
With the massive growth in the past year, “Teenager Therapy” took the next step in growing its impact. In the podcast’s early stages, Aitor was in charge of editing the podcast and producing the marketing material. Now the podcasters have joined forces with Flighthouse, a media brand on TikTok with over 28 million followers, which has provided the podcasters resources to execute their vision. 
Although the podcasters graduated high school and went their separate ways, “Teenager Therapy” continues to consistently post content and record once a week.
“We usually meet back at my house once a week to record which is manageable,” Pham said. “Since we don’t get to spend a lot of time with each other outside the podcast, it has felt like we have more to talk about and catch up on during the recordings.”
“Teenager Therapy”’s audience continues to grow — a feat that Aitor attributes to the group’s consistency. The podcasters continue to be active on all social media platforms, growing their audience more and more. 
“There were other teenage podcasts like ours, but they were not consistent,” Aitor said. “Consistency is really important, if you are consistent people will know you are serious and won’t forget about what you are working on.” 
For any students or teenagers hoping to launch their own podcast or passion project, the podcasters’ advice is to be your most authentic self. Prioritizing this is what makes their podcast so popular, according to Aitor.
“When you project a different version of yourself to appeal to others, it’ll be detrimental to your personal identity,” Pham said. “People are listening for you.”

The 2021 NFL season has been a showcase of USC talent so far, and Week 8 was no different. Although Sam Darnold, a former Trojan great, suffered a concussion against the Atlanta Falcons, he and plenty of other USC stars shined.
Michael Pittman Jr.
Michael Pittman Jr. is emerging as a top wide receiver for the Indianapolis Colts. He caught the key touchdown pass in the 4th quarter to ice the victory for the Colts Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers. This week, the 34th overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft hauled in two straight touchdowns receptions in the first quarter to put the Colts up 14-0 against the Tennessee Titans. Pittman Jr. finished with an impressive 10 catches for 86 yards and 2 touchdowns. He is now up to 4 touchdowns on the year, quadrupling last year’s total. Colts fans have plenty to be excited about in Pittman Jr. 
Robert Woods
Robert Woods had a productive outing Sunday, scoring his 40th career touchdown with a 16-yard run in the third quarter after scoring on a touchdown catch in the first half. It was the first time that Woods scored 2 touchdowns in a game all season. The former Trojan and current Los Angeles Ram tallied 3 receptions for 35 yards and ran for 22 yards as well. Sitting at 7-1, Woods is eyeing his second career Super Bowl appearance and first career Super Bowl victory. When the Rams went to the Super Bowl in 2018, Woods led the team with 86 receptions and 1,219 receiving yards. 
Talanoa Hufanga
Talanoa Hufanga, rookie safety for the San Francisco 49ers, earned his first career NFL start against the Chicago Bears Sunday. Hufanga was a top defensive option for the Trojans in 2020, tallying 62 total tackles, 3  sacks, 2 forced fumbles and 4 interceptions in the six games that USC played. Hufanga had a breakout game against the Bears, racking up a career-high five tackles. Hufanga had only earned 5 tackles all season before Sunday. 
Leonard Williams and Adoree’ Jackson
The former first-round talents were back in action Monday against the Kansas City Chiefs. Leonard Williams and Adoree’ Jackson spent a year together at USC in 2014 and now they are reunited on the New York Giants. Both players had solid performances in Kansas City. Williams tallied 6 total tackles and a sack. He now has 45 total tackles on the season with 4 tackles for loss and 5.5 sacks. Jackson tallied a whopping 12 total tackles, with 48 on the season. 
Sam Darnold
Although Carolina Panthers quarterback Darnold suffered a concussion with 6:58 remaining in the fourth quarter, he still helped lead his team to a divisional win. Darnold completed 13 of 24 pass attempts for 129 yards before he left the game. If he clears concussion protocol, Darnold will be back on the field Sunday against the New England Patriots, who he struggled against as a member of the New York Jets. On the season, Darnold is tied for first in rushing touchdowns amongst quarterbacks with 5.

Looking at the CONCACAF World Cup Qualifying calendar, Nov. 12 is the first date that really jumps out if you’re a United States Men’s National Team fan. Who else could it be but Mexico? The already fiery rivalry between these two teams will be amped up by the huge stakes that come with qualifying for Qatar’s 2022 World Cup, and it’s safe to say it will be must-watch soccer, even for neutral fans. Here’s why:
This particular game might end up being the most important fixture the USMNT will play by the end of the qualifying campaign because the U.S. will have the home-field advantage against their best competition, by far, in Mexico. 
Mexico tops the Octagon with 14 points from six games, and the U.S. sits in second place with 11. To get a feel for how close the two teams are, let me pose a hypothetical. Even just a one-goal U.S. win would tie the teams on points, goal difference and goals for. This would give way to the third tiebreaker, head-to-head points, in which the U.S. would have the advantage.
In less complex words, the U.S. doesn’t need to get a pretty win over Mexico — no matter how scrappy, just about any victory will do. If you’re new around here, that’s kind of a theme for the U.S. 
Braggadociously but truthfully, the USMNT has owned Mexico in 2021. El Tri suffered defeats in both the Nations League and the Gold Cup finals at the hands of the U.S. Those defeats are definitely going to rile their team up, making this a revenge game for Mexico. The fact of the matter is, as awesome as the two summer trophies for the USMNT were, this is the game that matters the most. 
The one aspect of this game that provides the slightest margin for error for the U.S. is that this international break only features two games: first Mexico then on the road against Jamaica. Even if the USMNT can’t get a positive result against its rivals, there’s room to recover against a Jamaican team that sits in sixth place. 
But it’s not just the context that makes this game so intriguing, it’s what actually happens on the pitch. 
If you’ve ever watched a U.S.-Mexico game, you know that no matter the stakes, the game is feisty. It’s physical, the fans get involved (sometimes too involved) and the referee is almost always handing out cards left and right. 
I’ve always felt that the more physicality in the game, the more the USMNT team tends to sink. Don’t get me wrong, the team has a few strong players, such as defenders John Brooks and Miles Robinson and midfielder Weston McKennie, but aside from them, I’m not confident that the U.S. can bring the heat. The U.S. has plenty of skillful players, but the skill tends to be negated when defenders are stuck in and purposefully fouling to stop attacking play.
In these games, tactics are often overshadowed by the physical play, but it doesn’t make them any less important. USMNT Manager Gregg Berhalter isn’t exactly a tactical mastermind, but when it matters the most, he has gotten results against El Tri. 
It’s hard to look at Berhalter’s team and assign it a distinct tactical ideology, but his system usually works best when the team’s best players have the ball and can create opportunities to score. Mexico happens to do a really good job at preventing specific players from receiving the ball. In the Nations League final, winger Christian Pulisic was shut out of the game for the most part, as the U.S. midfield couldn’t find him in advanced positions. 
Given that Pulisic is now coming off of an ankle injury that sidelined him for almost two months, I don’t see how things will be any different this time around. Mexico Manager Gerardo Martino knows exactly what his team needs to do to succeed, and a draw on the road to maintain first place wouldn’t be a bad result for El Tri either.
Hopefully I’ve now sold you on at least giving this game a watch. But enough with the preview. It’s time to get bold with predictions.  
Mexico isn’t going to roll over, but the U.S. will have a boost from the home crowd that should keep the team afloat. My score prediction is 1-1, with goals from U.S. forward Ricardo Pepi and Mexico midfielder Jesús Corona (assuming both of them start the game). 
The game is still just over a week away — a lot can and probably will change before then. The beauty of CONCACAF World Cup Qualifying lies in the unpredictability of the games. With the stakes higher than ever, this U.S. vs. Mexico match has all the ingredients of an all-time great matchup.

USC concludes its fall season this weekend with the ITA National Fall Championships in San Diego, Calif., culminating a season of competition with Trojans competing in both the singles and doubles tournaments.
The tournament will be held Nov. 4-7 at Barnes Tennis Center. Juniors Stefan Dostanic and Samuel Rubell will be competing  this weekend. 
Head Coach Brett Masi continues to look for growth and applications from practice every tournament. He said the team still has a long way to go for the NCAA Tournament and that they are continuing to improve. 
Dostanic qualified for the singles tournament after receiving an at-large bid. In October, Dostanic fell to eventual champion Pepperdine graduate Andrew Rogers in the semifinal of the ITA Division I Men’s Southwest Regional Championship in Malibu. 
Dostanic started the season ranked No. 68, according to the ITA National Rankings. As an  at-large bid, Dostanic was granted a spot in the tournament due to declined or duplicate qualifier spots.
“I knew he was an amazing player from day one as a freshman,” Masi said. “It’s just been a matter of time … I knew he was going to be successful.”
Dostanic will play in the doubles tournament with his partner Rubell in addition to playing in the singles tournament. The two qualified for the Fall Championships after winning the Southwest Regional Championship doubles in their first ever tournament together. They beat UCLA’s senior Patrick Zahraj and freshman Giacomo Revelli in the final. 
Rubell also lost in the semifinals of the singles tournament in the Southwest Regional Championship. 
“[Dostanic and Rubell] have good chemistry,” Masi said. “It’s not surprising that they’ve worked off each other well.” 
According to the ITA, the tournament consists of a consolation bracket, so one loss does not eliminate the players. For the doubles tournament, there is a match tiebreak in lieu of the third set in all draws.
Dostanic comes into this weekend ranked as the No. 4 singles player. He is set to play Kentucky graduate student Francois Musitelli Thursday morning. Musitelli finished second in the ITA Division I Men’s Ohio Valley Regional Championship in September, which qualified him for the Fall Championship. He was ranked No. 105 this preseason. 
Dostanic and Rubell are ranked No. 8 in the doubles tournament. They will play Montana State sophomores Matej Panik and Daan Van Dijk Thursday afternoon. 
The  duo of Panik and Van Dijk finished second in the ITA Division I Men’s Mountain Regional Championship back in September. 
This weekend’s tournament will close out the fall season. After this weekend and a short offseason break, the Trojans will take to the court in January 2022 to begin spring season play and compete for a national championship. 
“Obviously, you want to see success and win the tournament or bring home hardware,” Masi said. “But the real goal is to just keep trying to improve … We gotta get stronger in the gym in terms of our training and get our guys so that they can blast and maintain throughout an entire season.”
USC begins play in San Diego with Dostanic in the singles tournament Thursday at 9 a.m. Dostanic and Rubell start at 5:30 p.m. in the doubles tournament.

When Zadie Smith made her debut on campus, it was not at the Vision and Voices event at the Bovard Auditorium but in a small, tucked away room in Doheny Memorial Library. The 46-year-old British Jamaican novelist was at the library to have a preliminary interview in front of a crowd of about 30 audience members. 
It felt as if the entire room was holding its breath listening to her poignant answers, releasing only to chuckle at her quick-witted jokes, which she threw in many times during her responses.
She spoke as if she were a friend at a pub, not an accomplished writer who’s been lauded with critical acclaim and prestigious accolades since her early 20’s. The Cambridge alumna garnered attention before she even published a word. In 1997, when news broke out of a six-figure advance for her debut novel, “White Teeth,” that had yet to be finished, all eyes of the literary world were on her.
The debut novel, spanning three separate families from completely different racial, socio-economic and religious backgrounds in Northwest London, earned her the Guardian First Book Award, the Whitbread First Novel Award and widespread recognition as a fresh new face of British literature. 
It’s a spotlight that has continued to glow on Smith’s lengthy literary career. She was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2005 for her third novel “On Beauty,” has written essays and non-fiction pieces for numerous publications including the The New Yorker and The New York Times and is currently a Creative Writing MFA professor at New York University.
This intimate gathering with the accomplished writer was an adequate precursor to the grander, yet equally intimate Vision and Voices event in Bovard Auditorium. In front of over 700 people, she began the chilly evening with a reading of her short story, “Sentimental Education” from her 2019 collection of shorts, “Grand Union.”
In her deep-toned voice, Smith narrated a complex portrait of Monica, who goes to college and must interrogate her past and present through her sexual and philosophical relationships between two male colleagues, Leon and Darryl.
“The easy way she took [Darryl] into her body, for example, painlessly, subsuming him, providing him with temporary shelter until it came time to release,” read Smith in a pale pink turban, shrouded in a golden spotlight. “But it was the ‘90s. The language was not on her side. You didn’t release men. They pulled out. They were the subjects. I had become normal to hear them mouthing off in pubs, thrilled with the new license to speak sex aloud.”
The crowd was silent and patient, carefully threading together the strings of Smith’s verbose writing and off-kilter cultural references. They were leaning toward her in their chair, as if drawn into her prose.
This silence was often interrupted by a string of chuckles and belts of laughter from the audience, as Smith threw in quick-witted jokes about race, sex and perceptions of gender relations.
“[Leon] was the embodiment of the phrase ‘white youth’ when used in the police report,” Smith read. “He could steal your car in front of you, and you still wouldn’t be able to identify him in a lineup.”
Through comical nature, Smith immerses readers and listeners into heavy topics about race, class and notions of meritocracy. It’s this reference to real-life issues that Ben Parkhill, a senior majoring in narrative studies, appreciates in her writing. It’s what motivated him to come to the event.
“I read ‘Grand Union,’ the short story collection she put out, and they deal with a lot of themes of wealth disparity, issues of inequality, like racial gender lines,” Parkhill said. “A lot of it, social media, celebrity — there’s a lot of themes that are very relevant today and that still merit having books written about them.”
Another aspect that lends to the widespread admiration of Smith’s writing is the immense detail she uses, especially when carving out characters. It’s this phenomenon of “noticing” that writer and moderator Geoff Dyer noted in the beginning of the conversation with Smith after the reading.
“Your books and that story, they’re sort of founded in this sustaining,” Dyer said. “These sustained feats of noticing delicate subtleties of gestural revelation and social relations, relations, as we saw in that story, of class and race.”
It’s a theme that rings true from her debut, “White Teeth” to her later collections of essays in “Grand Union.” Smith’s writing concentrates on the minute: The tiny auburn hairs on someone’s chest, the grain of the wood of the chicken-shop table, the fleshy gap between white teeth. 
This aspect of encapsulating and categorizing physical perceptions into words is something that both writers spoke of as the conversation expanded.
“I really want to know what experiences, before you deliver me a language, in which to process it,” Smith said.
Language should be considered as a powerful tool that should be met with critical thought, Smith said. 
“I don’t understand the idea that we have this incredible skepticism about every power structure in the world but so innocent with our language,” Smith said. “Like where did these terms you’re using come from? Are they from an algorithm, are they from the past — who’s giving you these words as an expression of your own existential reality?”
It’s this aversion to conforming to the constructs of language that Aminta Skye, a freshman majoring in songwriting, heralds. She said she started reading Smith after the 2016 book, “Swing Time” was gifted to her by a friend.
“I feel like what draws me most to her work is something I would say for a Chimamanda [Ngozi], Toni Morrison as well, where it’s kind of this expression of not necessarily the Black experience as one thing, but like a Black experience without really explaining itself,” Skye said.
Skye said she values this work of creating complex, imperfect Black characters, which she feels are often diminished when a writer caters to the white gaze.
“I feel like there’s a huge distinction between Black work pandering to a white audience for the sake of being universal versus Black work by Black people for Black people not caring how it’s perceived,” Skye said.
Skye, who is half Senegalese and grew up with a Norwegian mother, said she empathizes with and appreciates how Smith stands out as a biracial woman writer in a predominantly white literary space. 
“As a mixed person, there is a certain sense of identity that I experience when I’m reading her that I hope all Black women feel to an extent that I never experienced before,” Skye said. “I don’t really gravitate to anything else [besides Black literature] at this point because I grew up never seeing that.” 
The colorful worlds that Smith constructs bring her diverse set of readers into a variety of perspectives, allowing her to touch into the complex spheres of race, class, gender, sex and ethnicity. Most importantly, her act of not noticing and not categorizing creates organic, fluid narratives that can speak to many intersections of the Black experience, whether it be in West Africa, North West London or even in Jamaica (for her next historical fiction novel still in the works).
“I’ve always felt like I was in someone else’s world, “ Skye said. ”And I feel like this author’s in my world.”

Content warning: The following article contains mentions of sexual assault. 
Title IX was the start of eliminating sex-based discrimination within education. As the federal civil rights law developed to ensure all students received equal opportunities on campus, its amendments expanded to cover all forms of sexual harassment and sexual violence. However, Title IX’s progress toward truly creating a safe learning environment has stagnated. To be completely honest, it has regressed. 
In August 2020, former United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos formally implemented changes to Title IX that reversed years of developing civil rights protection for students. One of the new regulations includes a “live hearing with cross-examination” requirement for post-secondary institutions, which reduces the institutions’ responsibility to investigate sexual assault off-campus, dissolves the recommended timeline for case resolution and removes anonymity for formal complaints. In summary: It is somehow even harder for victims of sexual assault to report their cases and find justice. 
DeVos made these changes to create a more “judicial-like process” and emphasize due process. However, the issue with Title IX has never been due process or false reporting. 
False allegations of sexual misconduct often receive high-profile investigations despite the low frequency of such cases. While the exact number of false reports is unknown because most sexual harassment instances are unreported, a commonly-cited study from the University of Amsterdam and Maastricht University puts the number at 1.16%. 
Yet the consequences of filing a false sexual misconduct report are still greater than the consequences of committing the crime itself. Under the California penal code for false police reports, “filing a false police report can be a misdemeanor or a felony. If convicted, an individual may serve up to 6 months in jail and/or pay a fine of up to $1,000.00.” On the other hand, a student convicted of sexual assault rarely faces criminal punishment and tends to only face suspension or expulsion. 
DeVos’ changes did not solve the nonexistent issue of false reporting or due process; they only created ambiguous legislation which places less liability and responsibility on higher education administration to take action against sexual assault and support their students. 
The new regulations leave many specifics up to each campus’ inclination. According to the USC Office of Equity, Equal Opportunity and Title IX FAQ, colleges and universities can “determine how best to prohibit discrimination, harassment, and retaliation and to respond in a way that is consistent with their institutional values.”
Apparently, this policy means publishing superficial statements, delays in reporting information about cases of sexual assault and an increased burden of proof for victims. 
In a WBUR commentary on the victims’ burdens of proof, writer and Berklee College of Music professor Deborah Bennett said, “What proof can one offer up to those who have not experienced sexual assault?”  
Victims already carry the trauma of the assault and the burden of facing their abusers, only for the law to ask them to provide more evidence to prove the unprovable. 
The Title IX process was already confusing and complicated before the new regulations. I was overwhelmed looking at the USC EEO-TIX Resolution Process for sexual misconduct, with various steps to go through to make a formal complaint and obscure language. There are no specifics for the time frame of the resolution or the nature of the evidence one must present.
As much as I appreciate all the supportive measures provided to students, these University resources aren’t going to eradicate sexual assault. They just put a flimsy bandaid on the issue.
Despite the freedom Title IX gives universities to specify the process of responding to cases of sexual assault to fit the specific needs of each campus, USC doesn’t do anything with this power. Instead, it completely drops the ball on the issue and waited over a month to address sexual assault reports from back in September. USC canceled its joint town hall with Undergraduate Student Government and the Student Coalition Against Sexual Violence Tuesday, only to host a webinar that heavily focused on Pass/No Pass policies which does nothing to stop sexual violence.
If Title IX doesn’t have the specifics, USC needs to create clear and pressing policies against sexual assault and against these predators that roam our campuses: Establish a clear timeline that schools must follow, continue with the belief that one is “innocent until proven guilty,” but put the well-being of the victim first by creating an actual guideline that truly defines sexual assault and its consequences. Because right now, it feels like Title IX does nothing more than console victims while assaulters run free. Fixing Title IX is far from easy, but we cannot afford to wait any longer.

Before colonizers first contacted them in 1542, the Tongva people lived in the Los Angeles Basin for millennia, with some estimates pinpointing their first settlement around 9,000 years ago. At one point, the Tongva occupied around 4,000 square miles of land split among 100 villages. 
However, this situation changed when the Spanish colonized the L.A. Basin in 1769, enslaving Tongva and destroying their villages. Not only did the Spanish destroy the Tongva’s physical culture, but they also usurped their identity, forcing Tongva to convert to Catholicism and change their tribe’s name to “Gabrieleño.” 
Currently, the estimated 3,000 living Tongva are stuck in limbo. They are not federally recognized despite their well-documented history, which prevents them from accessing benefits such as self-determination — the right to govern themselves.
Founded in 1880, USC occupies the Tongva and other tribes’ land. Although every original colonizer is dead, we are still the beneficiaries of genocide. 
In the last five years, we have begun to say that undermined part out loud. Universities and other large entities often institute “land acknowledgements” to address our colonial history. The statements will generally recognize the specific tribes who occupied and stewarded territory before European colonizers displaced them from their homes. 
This bare minimum action, which just tells factual history, is already controversial. Last January, the California Assembly introduced the AB-1968 Tribal Land Acknowledgement Act of 2020, which would encourage public institutions to incorporate land acknowledgement into their spaces. However, the bill stalled in the California Senate in November 2020, which shows the United States government’s reluctance to engage in transformative justice with Indigenous populations.
Like the state of California, USC does not have a formal land acknowledgement. The closest thing to an official statement is a land acknowledgement from the USC Dornsife Department of History, which is comprehensive in its account of Tongva history. However, one college subdepartment releasing a statement does not equate to the institution itself taking a stand. It is unclear why USC wouldn’t publish a permanent land acknowledgement, as it has posited multiple times that racial justice is a priority issue. 
Both institutions and individuals should acknowledge the Indigenous ancestors who once lived on the land we occupy. However, a fundamental problem with land acknowledgement is how institutions appropriate it to avoid further responsibility. For example, while USC needs to acknowledge its occupation of Tongva land, we owe a debt to Indigenous people that stretches far beyond that. 
When an institution admits its existence and prosperity squarely derives from bloodshed and genocide, their victims do not receive justice. These words are empty and distract from reality: Without opposition, colonizers will continue to exist and prosper from that same bloodshed. 
However, the situation would be different if an institution such as USC said, “Our University only operates because of the ethnic cleansing and forced displacement of Tongva people from the L.A. Basin, and we commit to actions x, y, and z to repair our violent history.” As a tool of transformative justice, land acknowledgement is solely a first step, validated by tangible actions that address systemic oppression. 
It is impossible to restore the world to its pre-colonialism state. Even if USC ceded all of its property to the Tongva today, we would not restore total sovereignty, as the U.S. would still lay claim to the land to some extent. 
However, there is precedent for land returns in California. In 2018, the Pacific Forest and Watershed Lands Stewardship Council gave Tásmam Koyóm, a 2,325-acre plot of land that ancestrally belonged to the Maidu tribe, to the Maidu Summit Consortium. The Council took matters into its own hands and redistributed the land back to the original, rightful owners.
LANDBACK, an Indigenous liberation movement, outlines a comprehensive reparations strategy, including land, language, ceremony, food, education, housing, healthcare, governance, medicines and kinship. Through this framework, USC should analyze how we can genuinely pursue racial justice. Otherwise, ignoring any one of these elements is only complacency. 
The University should award larger financial aid packages to Indigenous students and collaborate with the Native American Student Assembly to a greater extent. While NASA is a relatively new student organization and these partnerships may already be forming, it is essential USC allows Indigenous students more control over making the campus an affirming space. 
On a broader scale, USC should expand its impact beyond campus. According to a 2017 report, USC catalyzes around $6.11 billion annually across L.A., making the University one of the most significant economic powerhouses in the city. 
If the USC administration wants to prioritize racial justice, Indigenous liberation must be on its agenda. As a community, we should not be satisfied if we do not see Indigenous people, groups and organizations centered in private and nonprofit partnerships. 
It’s simple to believe the U.S. will never offer up tangible reparations to Indigenous communities. However, this belief is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we concede that land acknowledgement is the best an institution can offer, then it will be the only action it takes. However, if we demand more, divestment and returns may become a reality, as they did in Tásmam Koyóm.
