What a difference a week makes.
Last week at this time, the No. 2 USC men’s volleyball team was the top team on campus, in its conference and in the nation. But in the ebb-and-flow world of sports, the Trojans (6-3, 4-2) found out firsthand that championships aren’t won in April, they are earned through the grind of enduring tough February matches like the past few they’ve experienced.

For a month that is synonymous with love and kindness, February has dealt USC a cruel hand.
After blowing a late lead in Friday’s match over Pepperdine, in what would be the team’s last night atop the nation’s standings, it appeared the Trojans, like they have all year, would muster up enough grit to survive the hostile crowd they faced Wednesday night as they took on the No. 1 Cal State Northridge Matadors.
The Trojans came out flat in their first two sets against the Matadors, just as they had weeks earlier against UC Irvine. But unlike their emotional victory over the Anteaters, a comeback was not in the cards for USC. Despite crawling their way back into the match, with their most impressive set of the season (30-9), Cal State Northridge (9-1, 6-1) dominated the final set and cemented themselves as the No. 1 team in America (30-26, 30-28, 9-30, 26-30, 15-10).
As the Trojans enter tonight’s   7 p.m. match at the No. 9 UC Santa Barbara Gauchos, the team is using its current two game slide as a wakeup call — a realization that championship caliber team success comes in large part from the lessons of past failures.
“Losing two straight has been extremely hard on the team, especially in the way we have lost, in five sets on the road in front of large hostile crowds,” junior middle blocker Austin Zahn said. “It is never one of those things you can prepare yourself for or see coming in advance, but it has made the whole team realize that we really have to take every game as serious as a national championship game.”
The team’s ascension back to the top will not come easy tonight against the Gauchos (4-6, 4-3). Like the Trojans, the Gauchos’ have had success primarily on the road. While the team’s overall record is not impressive or intimidating, USC knows it will face a talented foe in Santa Barbara. The Gauchos have beaten several top level teams this season including UC Irvine, Stanford and Pacific.
Leading UCSB is junior opposite hitter and reigning Mountain Pacific Sports Federation player of the week, Cullen Irons.
Irons, who is near the top of the conference in kills and points per game, will look to secure the Gauchos’ first home win in a month, against a team he has had a high level of success against in his career. Last year against USC, Irons put on a remarkable performance with a career high 32 kills in a five-set loss.
For the Trojans, the focus will not be Irons or his Gaucho teammates tonight, it will be on themselves. The team’s recent fall from the top is partly due to the level of competition it has faced lately, but ask any member of the team and he will tell his record is not indicative of how successful this group has the potential to become.
“Starting 4-2 rather than 6-1 is not how I pictured the season going, but, when you look at how the MPSF is going so far, there have been many ups and downs for every team,” Zahn said. “Now we need to just make sure we go out with the mindset that we are still competing to win the MPSF outright and make sure we manage our loss column as best we can and keep building up wins.

In 2002, British director Gurinder Chadha delved into the complex world of the Indian ethnic identity in present-day England. Bend It Like Beckham — a film about a talented young Indian woman living in London with impressive soccer skills — places the main character’s European-influenced social life against the strict religious expectations of her Indian-born parents.
Just married · In It’s a Wonderful Afterlife, a mother kills the men who reject her daughter and is consequently haunted by their spirits. - Photo courtesy of Bend It Films 
This year, Chadha again attempted to draw viewers into the clash that occurs when traditional Indian culture meets postmodern realities, but her latest — It’s a Wonderful Afterlife, which premiered last week at Sundance 2010 — fails on so many levels.
In the opening scene, a man is rushed into the emergency room because he was forced to eat massive amounts of Indian food. But before there are any answers to his peculiar situation, his abdomen literally explodes like a volcano spewing curry everywhere.
Told in a light-hearted tone similar to Bend It Like Beckham, the story moves on from exploding stomachs to introduce a slightly overweight, aging Punjab girl, Roopie, whose mother, Mrs. Sethi , is pressuring her to search for the right mate.
Unbeknownst to Roopie, however, her mother has murdered a handful of people who have rejected her daughter as a bride. The detective assigned to the cases is a good-looking man, played by Sendhil Ramamurthy (of the T.V. show Heroes), and it becomes painfully obvious early on that he will be the film’s acceptable love interest.
As if the death-by-overeating premise wasn’t ridiculous enough, the plot’s main conflict hinges on the fact that the ghosts of Mrs. Sethi’s disgruntled victims follow her around and will not disappear until either she is dead or her daughter gets married.
As unique as this idea sounds, the conflict it creates is weak because nothing is really at stake. The film does not attempt to draw the audience into what might happen if these ghosts don’t go away. Who cares if Roopie doesn’t get married?
These ghosts will simply follow Mrs. Sethi around and mess around with her, which is probably to her benefit anyway because Mrs. Sethi seems lonely, and her irrational actions show that the woman might need some social interaction.
Also, Roopie, our supposed protagonist, isn’t very likeable. She doesn’t have a strong desire to go after anything, and her desire to face overwhelming obstacles — such as her mother and her weight — is nonexistent.
If the positive reaction from a portion of the audience is any indication, this film does connect with a certain demographic — single females over the age of 40. The only reason, however, is because they canrelate to the mother’s perspective of yearning for her daughter to be married. But, from a storytelling angle, most moviewatchers will be unable to connect with her struggle.
Chadha’s presentations both before and after the film were also embarrassing, showing her to be pretentious and self-ingratiating. Before the screening, she told the audience that there are elements of Frank Capra in the film and that she hoped he was with us watching. Because there was minimal Capra influence in the film, the comment simply made Chadha look bad.
Andy Warhol once said, “Everyone will get 15 minutes of fame,” and, during the post-screening Q&A session, the director — continuing the narcissism — attempted to get hers. She continued to take audience questions even after a Sundance official gave her three requests to stop, and her final answer was lengthy, milking every second of stage time.
Although the film was picked up by a distributer, don’t waste your money and, most importantly, two precious hours of life watching this movie when it is released.

The fans at the Galen Center had never seen anything like it.
Finisher · Senior forward Alex Stepheson finished with 10 points and eight rebounds in the Trojans’ 66-63 victory Thursday night. The Trojans closed out the Bears in the final minutes by hitting free throws and containing the California offense. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
After falling behind by 13 points in the first half against California, the USC men’s basketball team responded with an unthinkable, crowd-dazzling 25-0 run to wrestle the lead away from the Golden Bears. The visitors fought back late in the game, but in the end the Trojans (13-9, 5-5) fended off Cal to clinch a 66-63 victory Thursday night.
“It was a heck of a win for us, coming off a couple disappointing losses on the road and some ups and downs,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said.
With 1:55 left to play and USC trailing 57-56, redshirt senior guard Mike Gerrity drained a 3-pointer to retake the lead. One minute later, Gerrity hit another three, giving USC a 62-57 lead. California forward Theo Robertson responded on the other end with a three-pointer of his own to cut the deficit to two, but the Trojans held on from there.
“We needed some shots,” Gerrity said of his two late 3-pointers. “The coaches and my team had confidence in me. I just stepped in and shot them like I shot any other shot.”
Playing in his 125th career game — a new USC all-time record — senior guard Dwight Lewis led the Trojans with 13 points. Gerrity had three 3-pointers in all and finished with 12 points. Five other USC players added at least six points.
For California (14-8, 6-4), guard Jerome Randle scored 29 points, including 6 of 12 from behind the 3-point line, and guard Patrick Christopher added 11 points.
No other Bear had more than eight points as the Trojans defense did just enough to make Randle’s offensive explosion manageable. Randle entered the game as the fourth-leading scorer in the conference, averaging 18.9 points per game for the Bears.
The Trojans trailed by three to begin the second half, but that would change in a hurry. Lewis got things going with a 3-pointer that tied the score. Junior guard Marcus Simmons helped USC take its first lead of the game with a layup shortly thereafter, and the Trojans, who had already scored 10 unanswered points before the half, went on to score the next 10.
O’Neill credited the run in large part to Simmons, who played most of the second half in an effort to help USC in transition on both offense and defense.
“We were down 30-17,” O’Neill said. “We had to do something, so we went small. That small lineup toward the end of the first half and going into the second kept us going.”
The Golden Bears didn’t go down without a fight. After redshirt senior forward Marcus Johnson’s layup gave USC a 42-30 lead early in the second half, Cal answered with a 22-10 run, ensuring that the game would stay close down the stretch.
But the Trojans’ trademark defense proved to be a problem for Cal. Despite a hot start, the Golden Bears finished the game shooting just 39 percent from the field.
“We really dug in on the defensive end,” Gerrity said. “That’s been our thing all year. Good defense led to good offense.”
USC stumbled out of the gates in the first half, starting the game just 1 of 7 from the field. Cal, meanwhile, just couldn’t seem to miss and took a 30-17 lead a Randle 3-pointer with a little less than seven minutes left in the half.
But while their offense was sputtering, the Trojans began to lock down on defense, holding the Golden Bears scoreless for the next 6:48. With just 12 seconds left in the half, Lewis blocked guard Patrick Christopher’s shot and took the ball all the way down the court for an easy layup, capping a 10-0 USC run and cutting the Bears’ lead to 30-27 going into the break.
The Trojans had an abysmal 13 turnovers in the first half while shooting 10-of-26 from the field.
But when the game was over, all that mattered was that USC had rallied back after it looked like Cal was well on its way to a blowout.
“It was huge for us, the fact that we could overcome a large deficit,” Gerrity said. “It showed that the team came together. We never quit.”
The Trojans next tip-off is against Stanford on Saturday at the Galen Center at 4:30 p.m.

On the same night USC students voiced their opinions at an Expo Line Construction Authority Board meeting about the benefits of the new light rail, the board voted unanimously to extend the line from Downtown to Santa Monica.
Full steam ahead · Construction on phase one of the Expo line is underway by USC, and construction of phase two is expected to start before the end of the year now that the plan has passed. - Geo Tu| Daily Trojan 
Undergraduate Student Government President Holden Slusher and about eight other students went to the meeting to lobby for passage of phase two of the light rail. Phase one, which extends from Downtown to Culver City and runs along USC’s main campus, had already been approved.
Later, after students and other advocates had spoken, the board voted 6-0 to extend the rail the seven miles from Culver City to Colorado Avenue and Fourth Street, in the heart of Santa Monica.
The public meeting lasted several hours, as hundreds of residents and students voiced their support for or concerns about phase two of the Expo line project.
Though Slusher did not get a chance to speak at the hearing, he said it was good that other students went and made their voices heard as he believes this issue is important to students.
“We need a way to get around the city,” Slusher said after the meeting.
Officials hope construction will begin on the Santa Monica portion of the line later this year. Construction on the Downtown to Culver City portion is already underway.
“It’s a really great thing for students,” said Helen Moser, USG director of Campus Affairs. “Santa Monica is a really big draw.”
Representatives for Expo Rail reached out to students at USC and UCLA, asking them to show support for phase two at Thursday’s meeting. Moser helped organize a group of students from USG and other campus organizations to speak about the impact Expo Line would have on students.
“This is obviously a great benefit to the students and the faculty,” said Samantha Bricker, chief operating officer of the Expo Line Construction Authority. “It will connect Downtown to Santa Monica and provide linkages to other transportation centers. It will also bring people into the USC Exposition Park area and provide an alternative to the 10 Freeway.”
Some who attended Thursday’s hearing said they worried that at-grade crossings at busy intersections would be dangerous. Others fretted that the crossings would create traffic jams in already congested areas. Officials are considering raising the line above some intersections, which would cost millions of dollars.
The extension will cost an estimated $1.5 billion, funding officials say they’ve already secured from local and state sources. They hope to have the Culver City to Santa Monica portion running by 2015.
“I think the Expo Line will be really great for ’SC students, and I hope that they do extend it out to Santa Monica,” said Madeline Azevedo, a freshman majoring in business administration. “There is so much to do out there, but without a car, it’s almost impossible to get there.”
Azevedo also said she would be interested in taking the train because of its low environmental impact.
Moser said, “We live in this amazing city, and it’s important that students are able to explore it.”
Whitney Blaine contributed to this report.
Have you ever taken a bus westward in LA to either the coastline or UCLA? When you do, let me know how that journey goes.
You’re absolutely right about the traffic. The authority should have demanded more money be invested so that the line could have been elevated rather than at-grade. Unfortunately, in this city, we have to settle for what we can get it or so it seems.
Tommy.. people that want to go to the Bay Area that badly will find a way. In the meanwhile people that have to drive around USC will have to deal with annoying traffic and roads that mess up their cars so that some student can take a train to Santa Monica instead of the bus like everyone else.
This is great news for USC students. 
Also, I cannot wait till the high speed rail is completed. Then USC students can hop on the expo line, go to Union Station, get on the high speed, then San Francisco here we come. Though, the high speed will not be here till 2020, it will still be a great thing for the university, LA, and the bay area.

For the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the idea of awarding a single film the coveted title of best picture of the year has always been complicated. Sometimes the right film wins, sometimes the wrong film wins and sometimes the wrong film wins a record number of Oscars. No matter which film eventually takes top honors, however, there are always many left disappointed. 
This year, after the Academy chose to nominate 10 films instead of the regular five, the biggest disappointment has already revealed itself, and there should be very few ­— if any — surprises when the winner is announced next month.
After numerous award shows, including the Golden Globes, audiences across the world and members of Hollywood have already been given a very realistic idea of which films are generally considered to be the best 2009 had to offer, and, for the most part, the recognition has been consistent.
Before the Academy announced its nominations on the morning of Feb. 2, almost everyone was aware that Avatar, The Hurt Locker, Precious and Up in the Air would be among those considered for the best picture Oscar.
All of these films have received largely positive reviews from critics, and most have earned respectable box office numbers over the past several months: These are the films everyone has been talking about.
It’s a safe bet that the Oscar will go to one of these four, even though the usual fifth slot had not been filled. In previous award seasons, the vacant fifth slot has been filled by an unlikely candidate. This wild card selection is typically a film held in high regard by audiences and critics alike but that nonetheless stands little chance of winning.
This year, that extra addition is Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds. Though an entertaining film as well as one of the director’s best, Basterds is hardly an appropriate candidate for best film of the year.
The Academy is no stranger to nominating films without the requisite merit, oftentimes just to fill any holes to make for a solid five nominations, as it did in 2003 by adding Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World and Seabiscuit to the list of nominations when there was no chance they would beat The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, which did win. Ultimately, the additions were unnecessary.
The issue of filling the bill is just one of the many problems the Academy has faced over the years, but it seems to be growing more problematic with the inclusion of five more films to the ballot.
This is not the first time the Academy has nominated more than five films; it was actually the trend during the 1930s and 1940s to have anywhere from five to 10 or as many as 12 nominees a year. The Academy switched back to a mere five films in 1944 and has continued that tradition until this year.
So why the change when the number five has worked well enough for over 60 years? There’s no denying the Academy’s good intentions to broaden the perspective of the Oscars to include films that are both critical and commercial succeses and not to solely honor serious art-house films as it has done in the past. The move will hopefully disrupt the Academy’s elitist mentality by engaging more audiences as well as more films in the ceremony. But ultimately, the addition of the other films just seems so unnecessary when it is clear which films have a chance to win and which are just filling up space.
The Blind Side, District 9, An Education, A Serious Man and Up are all excellent additions to the list of best picture nominees: Not only is each a noteworthy motion picture in its own right, but each also reflects a very wide range of cinema, as an awards ceremony should. Unfortunately, it seems they have only been included in the show since there is really no chance any of them can beat the likes of Avatar or The Hurt Locker.
To make the distinction between the two groups of nominees even more pronounced, the Academy has given all of the directors of the five front-runner films nominations for best director, a move that serves not only to confirm the Academy’s outright favoritism but also to isolate the other five nominees as categorically inferior.
If there was not such a clear division between the five likely nominees and the five other nominees, the variety presented could mean so much more, but there is no arguing the fact that there are still only five serious contenders for the best picture Oscar.

Brian Green was initially motivated to learn how to play the guitar with the hope of winning the attention of his elementary school crush. Unfortunately, the girl wasn’t as impressed as he hoped she would be.

“In that sense, maybe it was slightly disappointing,” Green joked. “But I think it worked itself out in other ways.”
Now a much more refined musician, 25-year-old Green has assembled a diverse and impressive résumé, which includes recording a solo instrumental album, graduating from USC’s Thornton School of Music and touring with popular crooner Michael Bublé.
Just 10 years ago, Green began taking lessons from Ted Greene, a well-known and well-respected jazz musician from the Los Angeles area.
“Hearing him play really opened the door for me,” Green said. “He showed me some new and interesting ways of thinking about and understanding music.”
Inspired by his mentor, Green continued to develop his jazz guitar skills. Before his acceptance to Thornton in 2002, he already had several fine accomplishments under his belt. As a 2000 Spotlight Award finalist, he was invited to perform at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion with renowned pianist Gerald Clayton. Also a Clifford Brown/Stan Getz Fellow, he was later selected to be part of the 2001 Grammy band.
After a year of pursuing a studio jazz guitar degree, and with glowing recommendations from mutual contacts, Green was offered a spot in Bublé’s touring band. In the year and a half he was with the band, Green was able to record on Bublé’s Grammy-nominated album It’s Time and be the guitar soloist on the number one single, “Home.” He also played numerous esteemed venues such as the Sydney Opera House and the Hollywood Bowl, experiences that Green found very powerful.
“You end up getting on stage, and there’s this weight that you feel of how much talent has been where you are,” he recalled. “That’s a feeling that always resonates with me.”
Green describes his journey with Bublé as rewarding on more than one level.
“It helped me as a musician because having the experience of playing every single night with really great people definitely lifts you up and forces you to rise to the occasion,” he said.
Being in the band also taught him about the business aspect of his field, giving Green what he calls an “insider’s point of view” to what makes a difference in the music industry. But perhaps the experience he appreciated the most was learning how to be an engaging performer.
“Getting to see how [Michael Bublé] works the crowd and is able to understand them and bring them into his world is something that I’ve tried to emulate when it comes to my own performances,” Green said.
Although it was a difficult decision, Green left Bublé’s band in 2005 to return to Thornton.
“At the time, it was definitely the right decision for me to make,” he said. “It was clear I wanted to finish up school and work on some other projects and grow in that sense for a little while.”
Graduating in 2007, he began to record his debut album, Scenic Route. Recording the instrumental album is one achievement he is particularly proud of. Green said that while composing his music, he has no exact idea or concept in mind.
“A lot of the better ideas I’ve come up with have come from just experimenting and playing, not necessarily thinking about anything or being inspired by anything in particular,” he said. “The love I have for just sitting and playing the guitar seems to lead to the things I’m happiest with.”
While instrumental music still has a big influence on him, Green is now focused on his current project, playing lead guitar for the band The Whisper in the Roar. According to lead singer George Krikes, the band’s five members met at USC while studying jazz. They soon started to jam together outside of school, which led to songwriting and creating the concrete lineup of Green, Krikes, Bill Zimmerman on keyboards, Andrew Perusi on bass and Gavin Salmon on drums.
Encompassing a multitude of rock genres, the group has a sound as unique as its name, which was indirectly inspired by the title of singer-songwriter Tom Waits’ “Glitter and Doom” tour.
The band sought a name that reflected the wide emotional and musical range its members felt it has, finally deciding on the two contrasting forces of a whisper and a roar.
The songs are written by Green and Krikes, but in the end, it is a mostly collaborative effort from the whole group.
“We come from similar but different enough places that we can offer individual and unique insights,” Green said. “The end result is a cool combination, and it is better than what I would do by myself.”
Krikes explained that girls, death and despair are recurring themes in the band’s lyrics, but ultimately there is a positive message to be heard.
“We talk about these things without being too dark,” he said. “It’s a lot about considering decisions we make in our lives, and what path we’re taking.”
The Whisper in the Roar is currently unsigned but hopes to keep making new music and playing for as many people as possible. Green said that “the sky is the limit” for the band and he is excited to see this project through. Passing on some valuable wisdom to any aspiring musician, he advises to keep an open mind.
“It is good to be driven and have goals while not limiting yourself to one thing,” Green said.
“Where I am now is not the place that I would have thought I would end up when I first started at USC, and I think I’m at a place that is much happier now.”

Despite the pessimism pervading the job market right now, speakers and panelists at the first ever USC Career Fest have remained optimistic and are encouraging students to do the same.
Hiring · Marshall students have their résumés reviewed by professionals from finance, law, technology and other fields in Crocker Plaza. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
Career Fest, a week of events for USC students centered on topics related to job placement and the economy in every step of the career process, took place this week. Sponsored by the Career Planning & Placement Center, the event brought employers and experts to campus to help job seekers find opportunities and hone their job-finding strategies.
The week-long event culminates today with the “Career Fest Celebration in the Park,” which aims to give students a chance to learn more about various departments on campus and to meet different employers.
With unemployment at its highest level in decades, many students are seeking advice on how to find careers that will continue to flourish in the future.
Highlights of the week included the Career Fest 2010 keynote speaker, Ali Velshi, CNN’s Chief Business Correspondent and host of Your $$$$$, CNN’s weekend business roundtable program, and a discussion panel,  “Work in the New Economy: New Opportunities in Challenging Times.”
USC faculty members also spoke as part of a panel, offering their expertise to students.
Panelists included Geneva Overholser, director of the School of Journalism at USC’s Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism; Larry Harris, a Professor Fred V. Keenan chair in finance and director of the Center for Investment Studies; Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior scholar of the School of Policy, Planning and Development, and many more.
“The main advice I gave to students was to make use of the Trojan family and alumni resources,” said Jeffe.
Overholser advised students to hone their communication skills, regardless of the industry they plan to enter.
“Communication is at the center of everything,” she said.
Given the current economic situation, Eileen Kohan, executive director of the Career Planning & Placement Center, said more students are exploring the idea of graduate school as a contingency plan. She noted that this trend has not led to any drastic changes, however, and advised students to first test the waters of the job market.
Overholser said the key for students is to be flexible when looking for their first job.
“Students must be nimble when thinking about their first jobs,” Overholser said. “Careers have a way of working themselves out.”
Kohan said students should follow their passion.
“Students should pursue what they want to do,” she said.

When the Ronald Tutor Campus Center opens its doors in August, graduate students will finally have their own place to go — a new 3,000-square foot lounge that the Graduate and Professional Student Senate has decided to purchase.
GPSS voted earlier this week to spend $200,000 over the course of the next five years to name a lounge on the fourth floor of the new campus center. Though there was debate about whether the cost was worth it, the decision ultimately passed with a slim majority.
GPSS President Johannes Schmitt said he started exploring the possibility of purchasing the lounge with USC Student Affairs last semester.
He said he went in wanting to find some place for graduate students in the new building and was surprised by the administration’s swift response in offering them a space to call their own.
For five yearly payments of $40,000, the GPSS obtains naming rights for the lounge, allowing GPSS to name the space “The Graduate Student Lounge” and dedicate it to all graduate and professional students at USC.
Schmitt said he hopes naming the lounge will encourage graduate students to use it as a common space.
“There’s this problem of visibility of graduate students,” Schmitt said. “Every graduate program individually has a lounge within their department, but we want to encourage [graduate students] to come out of their comfort zone.”
Schmitt presented his proposal to the Senate on Monday night. Patrick Bailey, executive director of Student Life and Involvement, also spoke to the Senate, discussing a recent survey that revealed most USC graduate students sit in their cars between classes.
“Graduates at large have nothing specifically to themselves,” said Abhinav Chandran, public relations chair for GPSS. “Undergraduates have places to go. I know people who just do their work in Leavey, spend time in Leavey — having a place specifically for us, we’ve never had that before.”
Deborshi Saha, a graduate student studying computer science, said the lounge will be particularly useful for international students.
“I think a lounge would help international students meet local students,” Saha said. “Most graduate students I know go to the library or Burger King or the UV between classes.”
Some graduate students, however, think spending money to name the lounge was not a smart investment.
“Personally, I think we shouldn’t waste money [on naming the lounge],” GPSS Senator Sean Taitt, a first-year graduate student with the USC School of Social Work, said.
Taitt was one of several students to speak out against the proposal during the meeting.
“It’s another forum for networking, but it’s going to cost future graduate students more to pay for the building,” he said. “It takes away from others later on.”
One student senate member called out, “If it’s called the Barack Obama lounge, can I still use it? I don’t get why we need to name it.”
But Schmitt believes the name will encourage graduate students to “linger on and be there” and might help “foster a more prominent, unified graduate student community” on the campus.
Additional criticism of the proposal addressed the fact that the lounge will not actually be for the exclusive use of graduate students; as a common space in the campus center, it will be open to all students. Schmitt pointed out the potential benefits of the situation.
“Undergraduates should know there’s a place on the fourth floor they can go to ask questions or meet graduate students,” he said.
Schmitt said, though it seems like a lot of money, some students may not understand how large this year’s GPSS budget is.
In fall 2009, the graduate programming fee — which enables graduate students to attend and benefit from GPSS programs — was expanded to include all students taking less than six units. This expansion has generated approximately $200,000 in additional funds available to GPSS this year. Of this, 80 percent must go toward the GPSS travel grant fund. GPSS plans to make the payments for the lounge from left-over money in this fund.
Schmitt said he thinks this is an important step for graduate students.
“Undergraduates have so many opportunities to be a part of that Trojan experience,” Schmitt said. “I don’t think that Trojan experience exists for graduate students as much. Most graduate students, I think, would be interested in having more going on at the graduate community level, and I think The Graduate Student Lounge may help with that.”
The price is a bit much just for naming rights, but I think if the deal could be sweetened to provide exclusive access to graduate students, then it would be a worthwhile expenditure. There’s not as much in a name as there is in function. It’s high time the Trojan graduate community had a place to ourselves and a venue to come out of our shells. I haven’t heard of the survey concluding that grads spend their downtime in cars, but I do know a lot of us can become introverted just from hanging out at Leavey too much. If we’re going to spend that kind of money, it better be just for us.
I love the idea, but can someone explain why it’s going to cost so much. Grad school is part of USC, USC owns that building, so why charge so much (if anything)?
As a grad student, I think it’d be great if there was a place on campus that was restricted to graduate students and their guests. A bar, for example, would be a good idea — 21-year-old undergrads and 25-35 year old grads don’t really “fit” together in one on-campus bar, no matter how nice it is. The age groups are just looking for very different kinds of atmosphere. But this proposal isn’t a bar or restaurant, and it isn’t even exclusive. Also, it’s on the fourth floor! Who do you know that climbs three sets of stairs just to kick up their feet and relax? The space will either be abandoned, or if it is worth using as a study space, will be equally full of noisy undergrads talking about skateboards and comic books and things. Whatever it is they talk about.
Such a contentious subject! This is like Roe v. Wade, or Brown v. Board of Education.
Can you guys put my name on it? Oh, my name is Graduate Idiot because I can not spend the money by myself.
Venkat is correct. Let us keep this thread specifically pertaining to the graduate lounge.
Awesome! Another way for grad students to make themselves feel more important over the undergrads. I have never met such a large group of rude, self-entitled and disrespectful people as the grad students at USC (especially film grads) This will just allow for more superiority complexes to develop; undergrads had to pay for this building, why can’t it be the undergrad lounge?
Dear Nadav,
First of all in case you were not listening properly the idea of having the voting in the end was only a trial to see if it is more convenient for senators. I however do not remember you raising any objections when this was suggested at the start of the meeting.
In case you have not realized yet, the E Board has no voting privileges whatsoever. So to suggest that E Board is biased is quite unreasonable. I think the senators are smart enough to know what they want.
The committee reports are less than an hour and it should concern you. We present it to the senate because we are accountable to you. If you do not want to know if we are doing our duties then we will be quite happy to stop giving the reports. To say that it does not concern you shows you do not yet know your responsibilities. The most powerful component of this whole graduate system is neither the students nor the Eboard, it is the senate. So imagine if the senators become non active. I agree they already have enough work, but they do have a responsibility, because they are the ones with the power. So for you to say that its o.k to have non active senators is quite worrying.
Just because a decision was not made in your favor does not mean it is a bad decision. It was a decision made by a majority. As a president of VGSA you need to be respectful to others opinion especially when other fellow senators are speaking or else it gives VGSA an unnecessary bad image. VGSA has a very good reputation built over several years and have consistently bee the best umbrella organization over the years. You are in an important position and the way you carry yourself is how people will judge VGSA. If you have an opinion, then by all means make your point but do not try to enforce it on others. Mudslinging is not going to get you anywhere.
To everyone else,
I agree it is a big amount. I understand the concerns this raises. But I would like to clarify that this money is coming from a small percentage of the recent fee expansion. So that means this is coming from a new inflow of money so it does not interfere in any way with the existing allocation of funds. The fee expansion is the money paid by students who take less than 6 units. They also have an option to opt out of paying. This expansion is bringing in a new inflow of $200,000 of which only 20% or less than that will be used for the payment of the lounge. Besides that every year we have a large excess of money leftover from the travel grant funds, so we can use that excess money to pay too. This was not a decision made on impulse or for bragging rights.
To those who have commented who are not a senator, it would be nice if you could become a senator or at least attend the senate meeting as a non senator. We can always do with an opinion. Your comments would be very valuable during the meeting and may help the senate in making the decision. If you attend and you are not a senator you may not be able to vote, but definitely you can voice your opinion which is important and is what we want. Senate meetings are every first Monday of the month. Check the gpss website at usc.edu/gpss for the location. 
If you have any further question regarding this issue or on how to get involved please contact me at gpsspr@usc.edu. Also elections are coming up so if you have a strong opinion and feel you can do good things for graduate students, consider running for the elections.
Cheers
Abhinav
Abhi (GPSS PR chair), 
I was present throughout the meeting and do not recall being asked to move the voting to the start of the meeting. Trevor do you recall something?
The E-board is biased, more seriously certain members in it are not being honest towards the senate (i.e the “multiple” letters case from eh last meeting).
The committee reports are an option for me and the other senators to hear not an absolute necessaty like the voting and the finance requests. therefore they should be moved to the end of the meeting letting senators who have to go home leave. even if there is one person remaining in the room the committee chairs should give their shpill and the all thing  did not take less than an hour.
Please keep VGSA out of it, VSGA historically being the best umbrella org. has nothing to do with voting/not voting for E-board proposals. I am not mad about my proposal not being chosen to replace the current situation ( I am perfectly fine with keeping the situation vague) but I am very happy it outrulled the E-board proposal and unvailed certain traits that the E-board works hard to conceal. BTW, I am raising my opinion, the fact that you don’t like it is not my problem.
If something your folks should work on reducing the student fee rather than increasing your debt so you’ll have to increase it on the students again soon, I don’t buy the argument that it is a small amount from the student fee because 80% of your funds have to go to travel funds (worst case for you) starting a payment plan while you are still making payments is a bad idea. moreover it does not provide something tangible for the students that they don’t already have, even if it will called the Barack Obama  lounge me and the rest of the grad students could still use it.
I am all for GPSS getting non-senators students involved that was all my proposal was about, If you want to contact me I think I have some good suggestions about how can you go about it. what I am against is having 20 committees for 0 affairs just to create paid E-board positions and force senators to be active in them. My suggestion is keep only the committees that are essential for the function of GPSS (to be determined by he senate) and the rest of the committees can function as voluntary committees from head to tow. 
last I think posting something here w/out putting your name/position on it is cowardness
have a good weekend
Nadav
No comments regarding the new lounge… Leavey rocks as such… It definitely feels like a lounge with people sneaking in food and drinks, watchin youtube and having LOUD and fun conversations… 
Apart from that, I think you VGSA and GPSS guys should be havin’ your previous conversations in an email thread!
I voted in favor of this proposal by the GPSS Board. 
This proposal is a good opportunity to “grab” some extra relaxation/study space for the graduate students who would otherwise be packed into the basements of the libraries, or as was mentioned prior, sitting in their cars. There is no meeting place that I am aware of that is currently designated a “Graduate Lounge” where students from any discipline have group space to meet and work.
There is, of course, the counter-point of the “What’s in a name?” argument that was brought up at the Senate meeting and in this article. For this particular space, I think that having the name means quite a bit. I am not particularly interested in meeting my colleagues in the “Undergraduate Lounge” even though I would technically have every right to do so, and I would assume the same is true in the opposite case for anyone who is not a graduate student to want to use the “Graduate Lounge.”
Obviously, I am not of the opinion that this is a waste of money. The operating budget for GPSS is quite large; although someone from the Finance Committee please correct my facts if I am wrong. The proposed payments amount to about 5% of the GPSS total operating budget for the year, each year, for the next 5 years. This would amount to about a $2.50 fee on each graduate student to name this particular space; when each student pays in about $31.00 per year in programming fees. Not only is the lounge going to be available in the immediate future, but I believe that this lounge will exist for far longer than the proposed 5 year payment plan, and I look at it as an investment in our future graduate students who don’t work in an office or lab to have some place that they can call “home.”
Each incoming GPSS Board should focus on something larger than party boats and BBQs (although they have their place, too); a long term-plan of building something “good” for future generations of graduate students to benefit from. For this year’s GPSS, I think that this lounge is a good goal. I trust that Johannes, along with the rest of the Board, will conduct the contract negotiations with USC in a professional and competent manner to make sure that this space is kept as the “graduate student lounge,” and moreover that it continues to be used as a lounge because it is definitely true I am not interested in a future 3000 sq ft storage space called the “Graduate Lounge.”
Perhaps I am the only one reading or caring at this point, but I would recommend that Senators/Proxies that voted on this particular agenda item post their vote/view with their first name and the department they represent. This way, students we represent in the GPSS Senate at least have the name of someone they can contact with questions or concerns. For those that are impassioned about this particular issue or another issue regarding USC graduate life: get involved with GPSS or your local umbrella organization even if you are not a Senator, or at the least: contact your Senator. Let your opinions be heard!
Wastage of student money for a name!! Such a pathetic idea
Get money as GPSS fee from students and then blow it off….
Idiots.
I just wanted to address some of the critics of the newly approved lounge. I was present at the senate meeting and it was passed by a large majority of the present senators. Granted it was not a unanimous decision but there was enough support to suggest that this is actually something that many Grad students want. Patrick Bailey said at the senate meeting that a survey taken said that most grad students spend free time btwn classes in their car! How sad, hopefully this lounge will remedy that situation!
the vote did not pass easily and if you read this and think this suggestion is absurd you should take a look at the one offered by the election and recruitment chair that would panelize non-active senator by reducing their school funds, In my opinion the problem lays in the fact that the GPSS voting is kept to the end of the senate meeting (usually later than 9pm), when most of the senators leave the room (I guess most people have HW, family, jobs) and the remaining are exhausted/half a sleep from a 3 hours of listening to committee reports that do not event apply to them. Observer, your comment will gain much more value and credit if you will actually identify yourself. Thanx  Nadav
If you (not you, this Patrick Bailey) are not lying, I haven’t seen any such kind of survey. Suppose it is true, the reason people resting in their cars is not because we don’t have a room named for GPSS, instead it is because of the lack of space. With the new campus center coming, the space shortage should be alleviated. With or without a GPSS name plague on the door, we can go to any lounge there to rest and convene. It makes no sense you donate our money to the new building. Do you get a tax exempt out of it? We can donate ourselves out of our own willingness. 
Should senate disclose who votes Yay, who vote Nay?
Dose the senate have the right to spend money that does not belong to them, the money belonging to the future senates? Shouldn’t this matter be decided by all graduates who pay the fees?
…
Has undergraduate senate put in $200k to name an undergraduate lounge? Where would they go between classes? 
Such a moronic idea to waster money!
very bad idea, BTW I assume Jeniffer who wrote the first commet is Jeniffer Reynolds: GPSS academic affairs chair who pushed this idea in the first place.  FYI the GPSS board must (by the constitution) maintian neutral and unbiased.
We got our own version of Obama here in GPSS. I am totally against this investment. This kind of matters should be decided on a referendum, not by a couple of kids plucking their heads and wanting an “experience.” We already have good enough Trojan experience, we don’t want to waste this much money just for a naming right. 
I think GPSS deserves more scrutinies, in whatever  fashion it entails.
Will they serve beer?
The money towards this is taking away from fun events like the boat cruise. Graduate students are busy working…we don’t have time to go to a lounge. What a waste of money.
I’m so excited about the Grad Student Lounge and am thankful to the senators who took this historic opportunity to carve out a space for graduate and professional students on campus.

The USC men’s tennis team will finally get a chance to play No. 60 University of San Diego on Friday, after the original meeting between the two squads was postponed due to rain.
The Toreros (2-0, 0-0) were originally scheduled to visit USC’s campus on Jan. 26, but the normally cooperative weather of southern California took an unexpected turn as that date fell in the middle of nearly a week of rainy days.
Because of the rain-soaked courts from the end of last month, the No. 1 Trojans (5-0, 0-0) have played three matches in the past week, but have yet to drop a meet.
Freshman J.T. Sundling’s recent debut in the Trojans’ 7-0 sweep over UC Irvine is a welcome site for the Trojans, as their schedule begins to get more difficult as the season progresses.

The new calendar is up, the air is brisk, and The Rock’s latest picture has just opened in theaters. Must be time for the Oscars!
This year’s list of nominees arrives with a stacked bill of 10 best picture nominees, led by Kathryn Bigelow’s sobering Iraq picture, The Hurt Locker, and former husband James Cameron’s intergalactic amusement park, Avatar. However, before the scorecards come out, let us pay homage to the greatest 2009 victims of Oscar.
No. 1: Anthony Dod Mantle – Cinematography – Antichrist
Lars Von Trier’s artful masterpiece of grief, delusion, and genital mutilation is the rough equivalent of gonorrhea to Academy sensibilities. Still, the complete rejection of the film’s spellbindingly creative, horrific photography is nothing short of appalling. Where most cinematographers illuminate or darken, Mantle fills his spaces with silent screams, literally making the stones and the grass writhe in agony.
No. 2: Sam Rockwell – Actor – Moon
After a solid, honorable career of playing modest parts, Rockwell finally explodes on screen with his brilliant, schizophrenic turn in Duncan Jones’ Moon. The film itself may be too cerebral for Hollywood interests, but Rockwell’s performance is the stuff Best Actor nominations are made of: layered, agonized, humored, and finally, showy. His snub suggests the most shameful kind of industry elitism.
No. 3: Charlotte Gainsbourg – Actress – Antichrist
Operating in a realm that few actors would dare to venture, Gainsbourg delivers a performance in Antichrist that is terrifyingly realized, and unspeakably courageous. Not only is Gainsboug asked to inhabit perhaps one of the most disgusting, polarizing characters in cinema history, but she does so with nuanced fury, despair, and vulnerability. Thankfully, the Cannes jury was clear-headed enough recognize her astonishing feat.
No. 4: Michael Haneke – Best Director – The White Ribbon
If Fernando Meirelles could grab a nomination for City of God seven years ago, throwing Haneke out of the running is inexcusable. For over a decade, Haneke has been three steps ahead of Hollywood in his understanding of media, societal glaciation, and violence. His new film is a chilling subversion of a beloved period piece, contemplating the origins of terrorism, and sinking all other nominees for relevancy, atmosphere and effect.
No. 5: Anthony Mackie – Best Supporting Actor – The Hurt Locker
Jeremy Renner may have grabbed the spotlight, but Mackie’s equally compelling portrayal of the bomb squad’s sanest (and therefore most tortured) member is the emotional backbone of Kathryn Bigelow’s film. Pitch perfect throughout, Mackie delivers a heartbreakingly empathic performance, and resounds as the strongest cry that war and humanism are wholly incompatible.

On most mornings, I leave my apartment looking forward to the day ahead of me. I swing open the front door and mount my bike, eager to ride through campus on a beautiful Southern California day. That is, until I notice a haze dulling the morning sky. Alas, I try to convince myself that it’s just another day in Los Angeles. 
Perhaps three semesters at USC has acclimated me to the infamous L.A. smog. Before coming to USC, I’d never seen auto shops offer smog check services. Now, it’s common to notice a smog check sign on a corner, though it is more often than not partially obscured by a layer of smog. Yet when I return to my suburban Texas hometown or visit other cities, I find that I simply can’t accept that smog is normal. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Southern California smog levels exceed health standards for more than 80 days a year. No wonder.
In a new study published by Nature, springtime winds from South and East Asia carry substantial smog-causing ozone to the Western United States. This cross-border pollution has dramatically affected both industrial and rural regions of the Pacific United States. In our case, it only worsens the air quality and spoils the otherwise pleasant bike rides to class.
Last December’s United Nations climate change talks held in Copenhagen was a hopeful first step taken by the international society to combat climate change and deforestation — problems that have long been unattended to. However, it concluded on a tenuous note. The Copenhagen Accords, released this week, seeks to tie up loose ends. Its goal is to prevent global warming from increasing beyond a 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit rise from levels in pre-industrial times. More than 80 developed and developing countries signed the accord with their individual emission reduction plans, but no hard deadline for curbing greenhouse gas emissions or any enforcement provision was put in place.
Daily Trojan | Andrew Laskowski
The United States’ goal is to cut emissions in the range of 17 percent from levels five years ago. China, who had been taciturn and resistant in Copenhagen, signed on to a more specific agreement, promising to make sure the rate of emissions doesn’t surpass economic growth. Singapore, an influential nation that boasts the world’s second busiest port, made a similar decision, albeit one that clearly exemplifies the self-interest that governs all states in an international society. Singapore seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 16 percent below current levels but only if the other countries agree to a strong, legally binding deal.
For states, it appears the obligation to one another overrides any moral obligation, such as the duty to environmental protection.
In fact, climate change is the perfect game theory scenario: Why should country A yield to curbing greenhouse gases if country B doesn’t? Should country A compromise its industrial production and influence in order to do the morally right thing by addressing the global warming issue?
With this mindset and at this rate, it is unlikely that President Obama will see his spearheaded effort of combating climate change succeed in the near future. As Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists said, “The pledges put on the table to date do not put us on track to meet that goal and will make it very difficult for us politically and technically beyond 2020 to meet that target.”
Indeed, it’ll be interesting to see how next year’s Mexico City summit will pan out. The Copenhagen conference drafted a rudimentary outline of each country’s emission goals ­­— but next year’s delegations will have the challenge of filling in the gaps that were too large to tackle in Copenhagen.
It is said that ingenuity is born of necessity. If this isn’t an urgent, much-needed point in our history, then I don’t know what is. If we can feel the negative byproduct of human activity and other sources of climate change wafting over from across the Pacific Ocean, it must be a sign that climate change is a pressing global concern.
So at this urgent time, what we need is some kind of ingenuity to redefine the model of how the international society of states, or of organizations or people, perceive production, development and progress. Is there not a way to thrive as developed or developing countries while respecting the environment? Perhaps we have just been functioning too long in this age-old outlook of leaving the environment at the bottom of our priorities that we don’t realize we could rethink the model.
Converting to a Greenpeace activist is not the solution. An applied realization that we have a moral obligation to the planet is not only a responsible act but it could also help to overcome the frustrating impasse encountered repeatedly by states.
Nadine Tan is a sophomore majoring in business administration. Her column “World Rapport” runs Fridays.
Let me just point out the stupidest sentence in the article: “If we can feel the negative byproduct of human activity and other sources of climate change wafting over from across the Pacific Ocean, it must be a sign that climate change is a pressing global concern.” Whether or not there is ozone coming over the Pacific Ocean from Asia (I haven’t read that report), that fact tells you nothing about “climate change”. How *must* it be a sign? The very choice of the bet-hedging term “climate change” indicates that you, too, are doubtful of the theory of global warming. If the theory is right, shouldn’t it be getting warmer? Finally, how can you write an entire article headlined “Global warming does not have political ties” without mentioning Climategate or engaging with any of those who might argue that “global warming” DOES have political ties?
“Climate change has been happening since long before man’s evil emissions.” True.
Nature is more powerful than man. Science is not over, man still has plenty to learn.
It does not have political ties? There are many scientists who say it does not even exist! Climate change has been happening since long before man’s evil emissions.
Yawnnnnn…..BORING !!!!

America has long been considered the world’s melting pot ­— assimilating different cultures, ethnicities and religions under one flag, one country, one identity. Europe, on the other hand, never took on such a role. Close proximity to two other continents made migration almost inevitable. As one of the leaders in the European Union, France has a very special role in forming the European identity.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The Muslim population in France accounts for more than 5 million people, making Islam the nation’s second most practiced religion. There are over a thousand mosques and Islamic institutions, such as the French Council for the Muslim Religion.
Currently, there is debate about whether burkas — loose, enveloping body and head coverings worn by traditional Muslim women outside of the household — should be allowed in public.
In 2004, the French National Assembly banned any type of religious symbol from state school premises, delineating the distinction between state and religion. This decision and the persistence of a tough stance was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights.
The controversy over Muslim garb in France continues, with French President Nicolas Sarkozy arguing that the burka should be unequivocally condemned in public places. On Jan. 26, progress was made toward achieving such a policy with French lawmakers recommending a partial ban on any veils that cover the face. On Wednesday, French Prime Minister François Fillon declared that a man who forced his wife to wear a burka had “no place in our country.”
The decision to ban religious garb has its precedent in Turkey, a Muslim nation, when Mustafa Kemal Ataturk decided to modernize and westernize the nation by separating religion and state through the symbolic uncovering of Turkish women and removal of the fez. If a Muslim nation is willing to separate Islam from the state in public places, why shouldn’t France?
Based on the trend in coverage from the French newspaper, Le Monde, on the burka debate, it seems the nation is at a cross-roads. While the French do not believe that the burka has a place in France, an actual law banning the Muslim garment seems to go farther than many French feel comfortable with.
The burka is a liability to both security and freedom. In a New York Times opinion piece, pro-feminine rights Muslim contributor, Mona Eltahawy, explained that a burka “erases women from society and has nothing to do with Islam but everything to do with the hatred for women at the heart of the extremist ideology that preaches it.”
As President Sarkozy says, “[The burka] is a sign of the subjugation, of the submission of women. I want to say solemnly that it will not be welcome on our territory”.
Clearly, it is France’s intention to stand for women’s rights.
Will America follow in France’s footsteps and ban burkas as well? Probably not. But with regard to the French burka debate, it would be hypocritical for the United States to cast a disapproving look toward the French for their attempts to stand up for women’s rights by exercising a separation of church and state, one of the founding pillars of American democracy.
Melting pot it’s not, but France is not in the wrong for standing out among its Western peers.

Joe, you know absolutely nothing about Islam or Muslims, this is clear from your bizarre ideas about “radical islam”- what is that? fundamental shi’ism? fundamental sunni’ism? wahhabism? sufism? 
Also, thinking that you “speak” for Muslim women is laughable and misogynistic. Wearing a cloth on your head does not make you “treated like property”. God, why don’t you talk to actual Muslim people in Muslim countries before you even start to form another ignorant opinion.
Western nations have a right to choose who they allow to immigrate, and should expect and demand that those who immigrate quickly assimilate to the local culture. The US still does this pretty well, but Europe has for years ignored the growing problem of an actively hostile Muslim subculture in its midst, determined to preserve Islamic traditions and identity instead of assimilating. (As opposed to the Muslim communities in America, which assimilate fairly well.) It is surprising and heartening to see that the French (and the Swiss) have finally taken off the blinders of “multiculturalism” and “tolerance” and decided that coming from a foreign land does not exempt you from standards of right and wrong. While I think the “church and state” excuse is kind of a stretch, the important point is that the Europeans are making it clear that Muslims will have to shed the more medieval of their beliefs if they’re going to join Western civilization.
“should expect and demand that those who immigrate quickly assimilate to the local culture.”
Sorry, this is actually more characteristic of authoritarian systems than of Western liberal democracies. Maybe you have forgotten that the country you are supposedly standing up for is a Western liberal democracy that prides itself on diversity and openness? Your stances appears to be the least American of any of the stances thus far mentioned.
Ours is a Western liberal democracy that stands for freedom of speech, religion, and enterprise, for the premise that all men and women are created equal, and stands in opposition to tyranny. No one would suggest that all immigrants should be forced to assimilate to our sense of fashion or something, that’s absurd, but it is absolutely imperative that immigrants to the US embrace resepect for freedom and equality, sooner rather than later. Immigrants who want to enslave their wives, mutilate their daughters, and band together to persecute other religious groups are most definitely NOT the kind of “diversity” we pride ourselves on.
Just to clarify, I have said before that America does *not* have a significant problem with a hostile, unassimilable Muslim minority. Most of America’s Muslims have assimilated very well. Muslim extremism *is* a serious challenge for Europe, one they have turned a blind eye to for far too long. What we are seeing in France and Switzerland (with its ban on minarets) are the first realizations by the Europeans that they might actually have a problem.
“Immigrants who want to enslave their wives, mutilate their daughters, and band together to persecute other religious groups are most definitely NOT the kind of “diversity” we pride ourselves on.”
Great, I agree with you. But we’re not talking about any of those things. We’re talking about women choosing to cover themselves. That IS about regulating fashion, as you mentioned you wouldn’t do.
Why don’t you ASK the women choosing to cover up if they think they’re being oppressed by choosing to wear what they do- or if they think it would help them to have YOU forcibly remove their covering and violate their freedom to dress as they choose.
Yes, and why not ask battered women with bruises on their faces whether they “fell down”? Ask them while their husbands are standing next to them holding a baseball bat. Surely they’ll give an honest answer!
Radical Islam treats women as property, and considers homicide of non-believers to be just. We need not be cowed into “tolerance” of these beliefs for tolerance’s sake. It is absolutely, 100% reasonable to expect that Muslims shed these aspects of their belief systems if they wish to emigrate to Western nations. Sure, there may be one in a dozen women who *choose* to be treated as property, even one in a hundred who do so for reasons other than their upbringing in a morally diseased culture, but does that really change things? Is the freedom of one in a hundred women to adorn themselves in “slave chic” more important than the freedom and equal rights of the other 99?
How is limiting a woman’s right to wear whatever clothing she wants, religious or not, standing up for womens’ rights, as this author claims? Not all women who wear the burqa or abaya are forced to wear  it. I think it is absolutely ridiculous and offensive for a bunch of mostly male politicians to sit around and decide the fate of women in a religion they do not practice and obviously do not know enough about. 
To me, this debate is not about burqas or about Islam. No government anywhere in the world should create a law that so obviously targets such a defined group of people (in this case, Muslim women) with the claim that they are “liberating” them. The author of this article says the separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of the US, but does not apply it correctly. The first amendment forbids Congress from making any law that targets a specific religion. France has no such law, but if this author wants to be consistent in saying Americans should apply our historical belief of separation of church and state to this situation, than the US should unequivocally oppose such a ban and condemn France for using politics to try and influence how its citizens are allowed to practice religion. 
So the US will not just “probably not” follow in France’s footsteps, it never will because this sort of thing is unconstitutional. To support France in this ban is an insult to womens’ rights and a threat to tolerance and acceptance, and in fact takes France one step further from being any sort of “melting pot.”
The author has obviously not educated herself on the topic. This is another case of Western bias against Eastern cultures in which we see the West acting as if it is morally and ethically superior in asserting that the cultural practices of other cultures are some how wrong just because they don’t agree with Western culture. This author along with other people who agree with her are arrogant fools who probably know very little about Muslim culture, theology, and history. I doubt the author has even asked a Muslim woman who wears a burqa about how she feels about the issue before writing this. Assuming that people feel a certain way isn’t good journalism- good journalism finds the answers and doesn’t simply assume them. If France bans burqas then what’s next? Yamakas for Jews? Christian crosses? Sikh turbans? Where does it end? If France claims to be a free nation then why is it telling people how to dress? I humbly ask the author to please EDUCATE herself on the topic before writing.
After reading my above comment I realize I came off a little bit harsh. My goal wasn’t to make the author feel bad or to insult anyone but rather I’m trying to point out the importance of education (especially on controversial topics like this) before writing an article. Without proper knowledge of the history/reason for the burqa etc, it is not right to write an article about it. Again, I’m sorry if I came-off too strong. Thanks.
Oh and btw, I want to keep encouraging the Daily Trojan to have opinion articles dealing with international topics rather than silly campus issues. Articles such as this one help spark debate which inevitably leads to education and awareness of world affairs.
The roots of this problem go the gradual penetration of Islam in European society and body-politic, the effort on the part of (some/many Muslims) to affirm what they regard as their cultural heritage and symbol, and  the frustrated Europeans who, after a couple of centuries of dominating the rest of the world by imposing their own culture, besides economic exploitation and political oppression, are now in a pay-back-time phase.
Like it or not, Islam is going to play an increasing role in Europe and eventually in North America: For better or for worse, it remains to be seen. Perhaps for the better in some ways, perhaps for the worse in other.
In any event, the decline of the era of Christian-Caucasian of European identity is over, unless something drastic occurs. Spengler’s prediction is coming true in ways he never considered.

France doesn’t stand out amongst its peers for this debate and the government’s position on it. Ibn is correct: this is about individual liberties, and the separation of church and state in America is misinterpreted in this article. Banning the abaya in public is a supreme violation of this principle, as it would entail explicit federal law (though state, county, or even municipal law would be the same) that prohibited the exercise of a religious practice, and such a prohibition is a violation of the First Amendment.
Yes, it is true that there are many women are forced by their husbands to wear this garb, but it is also true that many of these women consider it a significant part of their identity. Sarkozy’s position–and any measure to specifically restrict the abaya’s presence in public–therefore comprises a severe disregard for self-identification, and is therefore  morally, and in the United States, legally, corrupt.
As a Muslim, I will say outright that the abaya (which is under debate, not the burka) has nothing to do with Islamic practice- but is instead related to traditions practiced in the 6th century in central Arabia, where both men and women tended to fully cover themselves from the desert heat.
At the same time- this is about individual liberties. The fact is that most of the women wearing abaya are CHOOSING to do so- this is a fact, both in France as well as in most Muslim countries (but not all). This has nothing to do with “separation between church and state”- this has to do with a woman’s fundamental right to choose what she does with her body.
There are many men in certain corners of the Muslim world who believe that they have the right to decide how women should cover themselves- and I think this is wrong, misogynistic, and authoritarian.
But what Miruna Barnoschi is proposing- regulation what women are allowed to wear in public- is just as wrong, misogynistic, and authoritarian.
I whole-heartedly agree with you.
The author clearly did not do her research on this issue. The whole article is incredibly biased and terribly lacking in substance and logic. And what is really worrisome is that the author is supposed to be an IR major. I hope she learns to take advantage of the ample resources available on this campus and actually educate herself on the next issue she decides to publish her opinion on
Islamic men want the burka becasue it covers the female curves, and thus removes the need for self control. Its all about male dominance.

The 10 emergency and trauma medical experts from the USC Keck School of Medicine who flew to Haiti to assist in the relief efforts after the devastating earthquake detailed their experiences at an event Wednesday night.
Helping hands · The surgeons and medical experts who provided medical relief to victims of the earthquake in Haiti spoke to an audience at Keck on Wednesday. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
The event showcased the medical relief efforts the Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center team undertook in photo slideshows and a video presentation.
Team leader Dr. Ramon Cestero and team member Dr. Henri Ford shared their stories to an audience of approximately 140 colleagues, students and friends.
“I’m so proud of the contributions our team made to the care of the Haitian people,” Ford said. “The level of expertise that we brought to the table is simply unparalleled. We have well-trained, outstanding people in one of the best trauma facilities, who happened to come to take care of injured Haitian children and adults. Those who benefited from their care, I would have to say, were really blessed.”
The team worked at the Israeli Military Field Hospital, a professional facility where they helped deliver seven infants, Cestero said.
The surgeons performed a number of amputations to save Haitians who otherwise might have died from their injuries. They worked night hours to keep the facility open from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., when the doctors and medical assistants performed triage and administered anesthesia and maintained the clinic.
“As far as the medical equipment, we were just bringing our expertise,” said Cestero, a Keck fellow and trauma surgeon at LAC + USC Medical Center, commenting on the self-sufficiency of the USC team.
Ford, a native Haitian and the Keck School’s vice dean of medical education, said that, in spite of the situation in Haiti, he has faith the country will recover.
“Despite the devastation, the misery and the suffering, I maintain an optimistic outlook for the future of Haiti because I believe that hope, faith, determination are the fundamental underpinnings of the Haitian people,” Ford said. “For those reasons, I know that they will rise from the ashes and, with the help of the international community and especially the Trojan family, we will build a new, stronger, better Haiti.”
The humanitarian efforts hit home for Ford, whose sister and brother-in-law were in Haiti when the tragic earthquake struck.
“It’s really hard to quantify, but, when I start looking at the journey that I went through since Jan. 12, I can only say that, somehow for the entire 51 years I have been on this earth, I was being prepared to intervene for a moment such as this one,” he said.
Ford helped mobilize the entire surgical community to respond to the tragedy in Haiti and used his expertise in pediatric trauma to provide much-needed surgical care in his native country.
The surgeon also said he was grateful for all of the volunteer contributions in the face of devastation and suffering in Haiti and saw a visible difference from every helping hand.
“The needs are so vast and will be long-lasting,” Ford said. “The opportunity to give will always be welcomed. Haiti is going to need money for a long time so donations are always going to be encouraged. Give a lot, give often. Beyond that, we need intellectual capital. We need people with skills of a broad range to actually go down there and help in the rebuilding process.”
Ford said he hopes the main USC campus will join the efforts already undertaken by the medical school.
“Looking at the Trojan family, I think we have a tremendous opportunity to play a pivotal role in rebuilding the new Haiti,” he said. “From the standpoint of the Keck School, we can play a major role in helping to rebuild the school of medicine that’s completely destroyed. We can help with the curriculum. We can really bring the talent that we have to help improve whatever they had before. We have a school of engineering, we have the school of planning and policy and so many others that can actually go right now and begin to contribute to the rebuilding process.”
Keck Dean Carmen Puliafito will be convening a council of the deans from various USC schools to bring resources together to help rebuild Haiti, Ford said.
The native Haitian plans to return in the near future to help rebuild the community where he grew up.
“Just seeing the look on peoples faces when I told them that I had to go back. The look of disappointment told me that I was abandoning them,” he said. “There’s no way that I could stay away indefinitely. Many of them saw me as a beacon of hope, as a strong advocate, and I have to continue to fulfill that role. I have to step forward and that’s why I need to spread the word here and also why I need to go back there.”

Striving to help homeless youth, a group of USC students have created Street Voice, an organization dedicated to encouraging self-sufficiency and empowerment among those living in local shelters.
The group focuses on reaching out to people living on the streets and helping them find long-term solutions. Nicole Sharma, a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning, and political science, was inspired to start the organization because of an experience she had in Washington, D.C. last semester.
“I saw a homeless man on a bus with a professional camera and he was selling newspapers,” Sharma said. “Right away, I thought it was great that nonprofits are making people that need help run the organization. It’s something more sustainable and long-term.”
Street Voice will partner with a different homeless shelter each semester. This spring, it is working with Jovenes, Inc., a shelter in East Los Angeles that provides help for youths between the ages of 18 to 24. The shelter serves more than 2,500 people a year by offering necessities to at-risk youth and equipping them with the tools they need to become self-sufficient.
“Jovenes uses USC’s resources, but they don’t have a volunteer center. They were ecstatic when they heard we were reaching out to their students,” Sharma said.
Because not many shelters target the 18-to-24 age group, the leaders of Street Voice said they believe it is extremely important to work with the shelters’ occupants and motivate them to enter into the work force.
“[The occupants] have to have jobs and work during the day,” said Dana Jebreel, a junior majoring in psychology and the vice president of Street Voice. “They’re not allowed to come back to the unit.”
Street Voice intends to work with those at Jovenes to put on a photography exhibit and publish a newspaper, both of which will be displayed on the USC campus.
The newspaper will feature stories about what the Jovenes youth think the USC community should know about homeless life. The paper will eventually be sold on campus.
Sharma said she thinks this is an important way to spread awareness.
“Everyone sees a homeless person every day, and the issue is embedded in the community,” Sharma said.
Currently seven members strong, Street Voice provides a number of volunteer opportunities for students passionate about helping the less fortunate.
“We want people who bring something unique to the table, and we hope to keep it small so that everyone is doing their part,” Jebreel said.
Street Voice is currently seeking fundraising from major corporate sponsors, such as Bank of America, for the first year. The costs for Street Voice are not high, however, because the only overhead expenses would be for printing.
Ultimately, Street Voice hopes to empower the homeless and give them the voice that society and financial circumstances have denied them.
“We want to blur the lines between USC and the homeless community,” Sharma said. “We are one big community.”
Wonderful. If we all do our part and help the needy, this world will be a much happier place to be in.

Already a popular destination for students looking for a bite to eat, the 29th Street Café building might also become a popular choice for students looking for university-owned housing.
Home sweet home · The residences in the 29th Street Café building will soon be owned by USC Housing. Though plans for the building are tentative, the acquisition will supply USC Housing with 10 additional beds. - Ben Rolnick | Daily Trojan 
In late December, USC Housing completed the purchase of the building that includes the 29th Street Café — commonly known as the 2-9 — hoping to add about 10 more beds for students. USC Housing is currently working with contractors to determine exactly how the residential space will be used. It hopes to have students living on the second and third floors of the building, above the cafe, by Jan. 1, 2011.
USC Housing purchased the 5,688-square-foot Victorian home, which USC has named the Hoover Street Residence (HSR), from alumni Edward and Ann Dorr, who chose to sell the property for financial reasons. The Dorrs’ real estate company, North University Park Properties, rents about 20 buildings in the USC area.
The 2-9 itself is owned by Larry Odell, who bought the cafe from the Dorrs in 2008.
Odell said the decision to sell the building was surprising and rushed.
Ann Dorr contacted him and fellow tenant CDI Management, a property management company, in mid-November with interest in selling immediately, he said. At about the same time, Dorr contacted USC Auxiliary Services Associate Senior Vice President Dan Stimmler, who considers property sale offers before presenting proposals to the university president and cabinet for final approval.
Neither tenant had interest in purchasing the building, leaving USC Housing with the opportunity to buy the property and become the new landlord.
“The building presents some interesting challenges to convert as much as possible to student housing,” said Daniel Moran, associate director of North Campus Housing. “We want to explore improving as much as we can while being careful of dollars spent. We’ve got to work with the space provided and figure out how to best suit everyone, including the current tenants.”
Moran said the planning process should be finished by May 31, with the construction of three double-bedrooms and four singles slated to begin in June.
Besides Odell, a number of other tenants currently occupy the space.
Three students currently live on the third floor of the building; two of them will be released from their leases after they graduate this semester. Moran said the third student would be provided alternative housing in the fall and would move back to HSR next spring.
CDI occupies most of the third floor and part of the second floor, but its lease ends July 31.
Odell’s leases for a second-floor office and the first-floor space containing the 2-9 expire mid-2013, but he could choose two five-year options after that.
Despite daily offers from property sellers, USC Housing Director Keenan Cheung said HSR is USC’s first real estate purchase of the school year. One of the most important factors in choosing to purchase the building was that, unlike other properties, the HSR will not require much repair work.
Cheung said USC was primarily interested in the building because of its location, but he added that the prospect of eventually having a restaurant in the building was also enticing.
A USC Auxiliary Services survey issued Jan. 26 to students living in North University Park sought reviews of the 2-9. One question asks, “If you could make the 2-9 into any Mexican food restaurant you wanted, what would it be?”
Odell said he has no involvement with the survey and said he’s unclear about USC’s intentions regarding the 2-9 when his lease ends.
“I used to own a Mexican restaurant, and I thought about making the 2-9 a Mexican restaurant,” Odell said. “But I have no intention of messing with anything because we are doing a huge amount of food here.”
Cheung said there are no plans to change the 2-9, and the survey is aimed at learning about its food quality and selection.
“We are taking over a building with a food venue we don’t control and wanted to learn more about the experience from the student perspective,” he said.
Also unchanged is the inability to swipe USCards at the 2-9. Though Odell said revenues could increase more than $15,000 per month if he could accept USCard, Auxiliary Services only allows USC-owned restaurants to accept them.
Adriana Arango, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said she wouldn’t want to see the 2-9 changed and wouldn’t be opposed to living above the 2-9 if it were affordable.
“It would be strange to live on top of a food place because of the odors and the noise, but there’s demand,” she said.
Michael Sahm, a senior majoring in business administration, said he agreed.
“As long as it’s nice and affordable, I think people would be interested,” he said.
Although the Los Angeles County Assessor’s Office valued HSR at $1.071 million in 2003, housing officials declined to comment on the purchase price.
Moran only said, “We got the building gift-wrapped and handed to us, and now we’re trying to make the most of it.”
