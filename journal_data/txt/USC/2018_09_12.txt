With a decisive win coming last Thursday against Concordia Irvine and a clean sweep of the Inland Empire Classic this past weekend, the top-ranked men’s water polo team moved to 7-0 this season. The Trojans look to continue their form this weekend at the annual Aggie Roundup, hosted by UC Davis.
Last Thursday saw prolific scoring from the Trojans en route to a 32-7 win at home against Concordia Irvine. Sophomore drivers Jacob Mercep and Marko Vavic, and freshman driver Hannes Daube netted 4 goals apiece for the Trojans. Freshman Jake Ehrhart also impressed with six steals.
The Trojans continued their string of dominance the following weekend at the Inland Empire Classic, where they outscored opponents 83-14.
The first day of the tournament featured victories over Redlands and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, with the Trojans winning 23-2 and 17-2 respectively. Daube and Ehrhart led the Trojans in scoring, with 5 and 4 goals, respectively, while freshman keeper Nic Porter denied 10 Redlands shots to keep a second half clean sheet. The Trojan offense kept their momentum against Claremont, with Vavic claiming 4 goals and Mercep scoring 3 goals. Goalies sophomore Vaios Vlahotasios and redshirt freshman Matt Moran-Flores split time in the cage, allowing only one CMS goal each.
Day two saw action against Concordia Irvine and La Verne, and the Trojans won by scores of 23-5 and 20-5, respectively. USC’s rematch against the Eagles saw familiar names pop up at the top of the score sheet, with Vavic scoring five times and Mercep four. The Trojans followed that up with a comprehensive win over La Verne, led by redshirt junior Sam Slobodien’s hat trick to close out a successful weekend.
Vavic finished the weekend with 13 goals, while Mercep hit 10 to combine for over a quarter of USC’s offense at the tournament. Vavic now leads USC with 21 goals on the season so far, ahead of Mercep’s 16.
The Trojans will be heading into this weekend with high expectations. This season has seen each game won by a margin of at least 15, and the squad already has a plethora of players with 10-plus goals on the season. Daube has been a huge factor in the Trojans’ success, earning MPSF Newcomer of the Week honors highlighted by a 5 goal effort against Redlands.
However, USC has yet to face a top-10 opponent; two strong programs in UC Santa Barbara and UC Davis, ranked No. 7 and No. 8 respectively, will be gunning to take down the mighty Trojans on day one of the Aggie Roundup. UC Santa Barbara gave USC one of its closer games last season, as the Trojans won 6-3. The No. 7 Gauchos will be looking to avenge their loss after a strong start to the year, having only fallen to Cal so far.
UC Davis also looks to be a strong contender, with a solid start only marred by close losses to Cal and Harvard — both of whom featured at the NCAA Championship last December. 
Day two of the Aggie Roundup will likely be a return to form for the Trojans, who will look to repeat against Whittier. USC will match up against Fresno Pacific, a team they handily beat 24-3 last season, later on Sunday.
The action begins Saturday at 9:15 a.m. against UCSB, followed by a matchup against host UC Davis at 1 p.m., while Sunday’s games against Whittier and Fresno Pacific are slated for 10:45 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., respectively.

Sophomore outside hitter finalist for 2015 and 2016 Gatorade Texas Player of the Year (Sarah Kim | Daily Trojan)
The No. 16 women’s volleyball team will head to San Diego this Friday to take on Louisiana and No. 23 San Diego in the SDSU/USD Challenge.
The Trojans are coming off of a rough weekend in Milwaukee where they lost to then-No. 3 Brigham Young University and tournament host Marquette but secured a win in their third match of the weekend against Syracuse. This pair of losses came in spite of some impressive performances, including 13 kills each in the BYU match by three Trojan outside hitters: sophomore Brooke Botkin and juniors Khalia Lanier and Emily Baptista. The Women of Troy finished out the tournament in a positive fashion by winning three sets in a row against Syracuse by large margins. 
Another tournament away from home provides a challenge for the Trojans, especially considering that their second opponent, the University of San Diego, has the advantage of playing in front of its home crowd. The Toreros’ poor overall record of 2-4, including a 2-2 record at home, doesn’t seem to fit its Top 25 NCAA ranking. This apparent contradiction in record and ranking is indicative of the formidable opponents which they have already faced, including UCLA. This weekend, USD will be seeking to prove themselves deserving of the No. 23 spot after conceding a match to unranked Tennessee last weekend.
The Ragin’ Cajuns of Louisiana are not to be ignored, as they have bolstered their squad with the addition of seven new players in the offseason. Louisiana has posted a record of 7-4 so far this season, although this match will be their first of the season against a Pac-12 team. Among the leaders of their attack is sophomore outside hitter Hali Wisnoskie, who garnered several awards for her standout performance last season, including Sun Belt Conference Freshman of the Year. Wisnoskie currently boasts 131 kills among 378 total attacks.
The Trojans aim to combat the potent offenses of the San Diego and Louisiana squads with the talent and athleticism of their own players. They will look to freshman setter Raquel Lázaro, a two-time Pac-12 Freshman of the Week, as the linchpin of their defensive effort once again. The leadership of Lanier, who earned an MVP distinction for the Trojan Invitational, will also remain essential for a young team playing away from home.
The SDSU/USD Challenge this Friday marks the end of tournament play for the Women of Troy this season as they begin to face Pac-12 opponents. So far, the Trojans have earned a record of 6-3 in tournament play while facing fierce competition such as No. 1 BYU.
After Friday’s tournament, the Women of Troy will return home to play UCLA on Sept. 19. The Bruins are tied for the No. 16 in the NCAA rankings with the Trojans, after being swept by Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in a two-game series on the road. Last season, USC defeated UCLA in their first meeting, while they lost in three sets at the Galen Center two months later. This season, the Bruins are also a young squad with two freshman starters: setter and opposite hitter Hawley Harrer and setter Devon Chang.
The Trojans will face Louisiana at noon on Friday before playing San Diego at 6 p.m. They then face their toughest opponent of the week, UCLA, at 8 p.m. on Wednesday.

Redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns recorded 84 yards against Stanford. (Sarah Kim | Daily Trojan)
With the road trip to Austin only days away, head coach Clay Helton and the Trojans emphasized third down zone reads and defensive consistency during practice on Wednesday night.
The Texas game is a peculiar rivalry for USC. It’s not an annual rival like Notre Dame, or a conference opponent like Stanford. Instead, it’s a hatred born out of past championships lost and won. The USC vs. Texas game has often answered the question of what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.
But as his team prepares to touch down in Texas — a state that has been unforgiving to Helton over his two years as head coach — the head coach is attempting to turn his team’s focus away from the hype and towards the X’s and O’s. On Wednesday, he continued this mantra, focusing on molding a young, injury-ridden team to its new opponent.
“We just need to remain who we are,” senior captain linebacker Cam Smith said. “We’re just there for a business trip.”
Defense prepares for change of pace
Compared to the grind of Stanford’s pace of attack, the Longhorns will provide a quick tempo offense for the Trojan defense to master on Saturday. The biggest worry for the defense will be quarterback Sam Ehlinger, who threw for 298 yards and two touchdowns, including a last-second 17-yarder to force overtime, last year against USC.
Last year, Ehlinger was one costly mistake away from an upset — in double overtime, he dove for a first down within the USC five-yard line, only to have the ball stripped out of his arms. This year, Ehlinger brings experience and home field advantage to the table, with 500 yards and four throwing touchdowns already under his belt. The Trojan defense, meanwhile, is struggling at the secondary position, with injuries racking the lineup at cornerback and safety.
Senior captain Marvell Tell III has risen to the occasion, standing as the sole constant in secondary that has suffered a revolving door of injuries in the opening weeks of the season. In the wake of these injuries, Tell has been called on to marshal the young position group, a skill that Helton says is a sign of his growth since his freshman year.
“His first two years here, he was a guy who just focused on his job,” Helton said. “But in [defensive coordinator] Clancy [Pendergast]’s defense, there’s just so much communication that you have to have … And it’s made Marvel a better player. He’s become a true student of the game.”
One of the young players to step up into that role was freshman Talanoa Hufanga, who notched three tackles in the Stanford game. With the depth chart limited, the game threw Hufanga into a high stakes environment against the Cardinal, where he exceeded coaches’ expectations. 
In practice, Hufanga continued to dominate the spotlight, grabbing an impressive interception in a drill off of Daniels. As the stakes are raised this week against Ehlinger and the Longhorns, the freshman is following Helton’s advice and trying to avoid the hype.
“For me, my confidence has to stay up no matter what,” Hufanga said. “It’s like a practice. For me, I’m just trying to take each practice the way I would. On the road at Texas, there’s gonna be a lot of stadium noise, but for us I think we’re just gonna play our game.”
Despite blunders, freshman quarterback JT Daniels remains a sure thing
After failing to score a touchdown against Stanford, Daniels remains the unquestionable starter for Helton heading into Saturday’s game. Helton said that time and experience will be important to help mature the freshman mature into his role. Daniels continues to look more comfortable after suffering a severe bruise to his hand in the first quarter of the Stanford game. 
Looking ahead to Saturday’s game, the team is studying the Longhorn defense, which specializes in using zone coverage on third down to disrupt offenses. The addition of Josh Falo’s return at the tight end position will also add a much-needed boost to Daniels’ targets against this Texas defense.
Injury report
Safety Bubba Bolden remains missing from practice due to undisclosed reasons. Cornerback Isaiah Langley continues to be limited due to a hip injury.
Chuma Edoga did not practice today due to a stomach bug, but Helton expects him to return to practice tomorrow. Edoga was previously struggling with a sore hip.

By now, the debacle of Serena Williams and the U.S. Open is old news. 
Everyone knows about the alleged cheating, the racket throw, the “thief” comment and all of its fallout. But while it might be easy to move on from this controversy, I’ve found over the last week that the incident was a frightening barometer for the attitude of the sports world towards black female athletes.
It must be pointed out that the U.S. Open wasn’t having a stellar year in gender equity before Serena entered the mix. Days before, French tennis player Alizé Cornet was penalized after she rushed to change her shirt during a heat break, then took it off to turn it right-side-out on the court shortly before resuming play. 
In the same tournament, male stars John Isner and Novak Djokovic had removed their shirts and sat shirtless without receiving penalties, and the disparity earned mass criticism from sports fans across the country. The foundation for an apparent pattern of unbalanced violation enforcement already existed before Serena and her opponent, Naomi Osaka, even took the court on Saturday afternoon.
And for Serena, maybe, it just felt like it was all just too much. This moment can’t be taken out of context for her, either. The star battled a life-threatening complication after delivering her child last year, then was banned from wearing a suit made to help her condition at the French Open. 
This is a woman who has been questioned and criticized with open abandon for the entirety of her career. Now, she has been accused of cheating and robbed of a game point by a man in a chair who was abnormally strict in his enforcement. Maybe on Saturday, with her game slipping against a young challenger and her body tiring after an exhausting year of competition, it all just felt like too much. 
As we transition away from the Open weekend, the issue now, however, isn’t whether Serena was right or wrong. The debate over Carlos Ramos’ decision raged over the weekend, but it’s midweek now, and attention is turning already away from tennis and back to Thursday Night Football and College GameDay. 
There won’t ever be a conclusion to that debate. Sports media thrives off of debates — Was that a catch? Was that a foul? Were those balls deflated? The question now isn’t the “right or wrong” of the debate. It’s the way that the two black women at its center have been treated by those on either side.
No voice has been minimalized more in American culture than the voice of the black woman. Black women are silenced, ignored and oppressed more than almost any other figure (perhaps, besides, Native and trans people) in our country, and this pattern polices our expectation for them.
Nothing is more strictly regulated than the anger of a black woman. Just look at the way Serena’s actions have been described. The most commonly used word was “meltdown,” a word that paints the picture of a woman throwing a tantrum, not of an athlete aggressively advocating for her rights. 
Serena’s actions are repeated by many — mainly white — men in the game, yet they are not seen as threatening or overemotional. The difference is clear. Men may voice their opinions in firm tones. Men may be bullies. But women are expected to be docile, calm, respectful. This myth of the calm woman actually comes from the fear of women who are the opposite — fiery, strong, unafraid of challenge.
This fear is best represented by an Australian cartoon that ran this week, which depicted Serena in an aggressively racist fashion based off of Mammy cartoons from the 1930s. Even if the umpire’s decision wasn’t racist or sexist, the reaction to Serena’s conduct has been unendingly so. 
It’s not just racist caricatures, either. One of the arguments against Serena that I’ve heard most often is that she stole the show from her opponent, the 20-year-old Osaka who became the first Japanese woman to win the Open. Somehow, it became Serena’s fault that the crowd booed during the trophy presentation, that the national headlines focused on the American runner-up rather than the Japanese winner.
This is not fair, and you wouldn’t see it with male competitors. Serena should not stay silent and stop advocating for herself just because Osaka is making history, and this expectation that she should step aside to lift up other women is yet another double standard that is often foisted on women in sports.
Women should be allowed to be competitors. They should be allowed to argue with referees, to complain about violation calls, in the same way that LeBron James is allowed to, without nationwide controversy. 
This expectation of deference is common, yet it unfairly expects female athletes to put other women’s needs above themselves. That expectation must be erased in order for female athletes to be able to equally advocate for themselves.
Win or lose, Serena’s willingness to speak for herself should be applauded, not condemned. And until that sentiment is widely felt, the world of sports will not be equal for men and women.

According to DPS, bikes have always been banned at USC Village but the policy had not been strongly enforced. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The Department of Public Safety is cracking down on the use of bicycles, skateboards and motorized vehicles at USC Village. On Tuesday, an increased number of DPS officers patrolled the Village area, passing out flyers and stopping students who failed to dismount their vehicles.
Some students were surprised by the seemingly new strict oversight; but since its conception, the USC Village quad has always banned the use of bicycles, according to DPS training coordinator Michelle Velasco.
“Today we put up signs indicating that this is a dismount zone,” Velasco said. “We want students to dismount before entering the center quad. And it’s really just because we’re trying to create that safe environment for all the guests of the Village in that quad area, because of all the restaurants and businesses and people out there. ”
Because the bike ban was loosely implemented until now, many students were confused by the new regulations. 
“It was kind of ridiculous that there was six police officers standing there,” said Leah James, a sophomore studying international relations and global business. “But, I do understand why they don’t want me riding my bike in the crowded village.”
Velasco explained that DPS has been unable to commit to a complete enforcement of the bike ban due to staff shortages. However, DPS had a surplus of officers working on Tuesday which presented the opportunity to strictly patrol USC Village. 
“It’s been a lot harder to enforce [the ban] this year,” Velasco said. “We’ve pushed the [ban] information to all the resident advisors that are at the Village so they can push the information up to their students.”
DPS hopes to create a safer experience for both students and guests alike. Velasco said that she hopes students become more educated about where they can ride by putting up A-frames and handing out flyers with USC Village’s rules. 
“I firmly oppose the ban,” said Joshua Shaw, a junior studying international relations and economics. “If you have basic coordination skills, you won’t hit anyone. I have also seen DPS ride through the Village and it seems hypocritical.” 
Velasco pointed out that although no one has yet been hit by a bike at USC Village, there have been several “close calls.” 
“When we have a lot of bicycles, it’s almost like the center of campus [where] people almost get hit all the time,” Velasco said. 
Starting next Tuesday, DPS will be enforcing a zero-tolerance policy in the dismount zone and offenders will be given citations for non-compliance. 
“This week, it’s all just verbal warnings. Next week, it will be like a verbal warning, but we’re documenting your information now,” Velasco said. “We’ve got numerous complaints from the retail people, we’ve got numerous complaints from residents, from faculty and staff [and] guests, saying, ‘I almost got hit today.’ That is really why we are trying to push this education and [are] putting these signs up.”

Several University administrators were aware of former state legislator Sebastian Ridley-Thomas’ status as a student when he was hired to teach at USC, a conflict that later led to his termination as a professor, according to documents acquired by the Daily Trojan.
Ridley-Thomas, who stepped down from his position as a member of the state Assembly in December 2017, was accepted to an on online social work program in January 2018 and awarded a full-tuition scholarship. A month later, he received a non-tenure track faculty position as a “professor of practice” in the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and the Price School of Public Policy.
In July, a month after a donation his father made to the University was disclosed to federal investigators, USC fired Ridley-Thomas. The details of his hiring and admission were made public in a Los Angeles Times report in August. 
In an email to Ridley-Thomas on July 18, Vice Provost Martin Levine told the former state legislator that due to Faculty Handbook policies “that faculty members shall not be candidates for degrees in the same program in which they have an appointment,” the administration had “determined that appropriate corrective action … is immediate termination of [his] faculty appointment.”
However, email correspondences among Ridley-Thomas, former School of Social Work Dean Marilyn Flynn and other administrators from the Dworak-Peck and Price schools suggest that University leaders were aware of Ridley-Thomas’ status as a student when they hired him.
Communication between Flynn and Ridley-Thomas dates back to May 2017 — over seven months before he enrolled at USC as a student. In an email on May 26, 2017, Flynn wrote that she had “a chance to talk with Dean [Jack] Knott at the Price School,” stating that the two schools would support his tuition. The School of Social Work would later fully cover the legislator’s tuition.
In January the following year, he was formally notified of a full-tuition scholarship and started an online social work program that semester.
One month after becoming a student, Ridley-Thomas received a letter signed by both Knott and Flynn informing him of his appointment as Professor of Practice of Policy and Social Work where his “service to both schools” would include “classroom presentations related to the political process, and assisting in organizing events involving both local and state governments.”
“Like all other new students and people who are offered employment, Mr. Ridley-Thomas relied on the deans and academic administrators at USC to know and follow the university’s rules,” wrote Lance Olson, Ridley-Thomas’ attorney, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Naturally, he believed that everything was in order.”
Approval for Ridley-Thomas’ position even went through the Provost’s Office. On Feb. 13, a Price School official wrote to Ridley-Thomas, saying that the school had “received Provost approval of our request to waive our usual hiring process.” Ridley-Thomas accepted the appointment on March 10.
According to a source in the University administration, this procedure is normal for professors of professional practice. Typically, those hired under this process are individuals who are practicing or retired and may not have the same academic credentials that other professors hold, so waiving the usual process means they don’t have to be reviewed by faculty committees, the source said.
The latest revelation came after a string of stories from the Los Angeles Times regarding Ridley-Thomas’ resignation from the state Assembly and his role at the University. The Times reported that his father, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, made a $100,000 donation from his campaign fund to the School of Social Work, which was later funneled to a think tank unaffiliated with USC and led by Sebastian Ridley-Thomas.
“[Ridley-Thomas’] enrollment and employment at USC began months before the donation was even made,” Olson said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Any suggestion that there is a connection between the two is patently false.”
Last month, Ridley-Thomas accused the University of violating student privacy laws by disclosing information regarding his scholarship and status at the University.
“Of particular concern is the fact the Times was clearly told of the Compliance Office interview of my client,” Olson wrote in a letter to USC’s attorney in August. “That information could only have come from one of the three persons from USC who participated in the interview.”
USC and several administrators from the School of Social Work declined to comment on Ridley-Thomas’ hiring, citing privacy protection laws for students and faculty and the pending nature of the federal investigation.

Senators Michaela Murphy and Meagan Lane speak at Tuesday’s senate meeting. USG unanimously approved a special committee to amend the diversity fund after student groups felt that the fund lacked accessibility. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The Undergraduate Student Government met Tuesday to move forward on one of this semester’s pressing issues: amending the student government diversity fund. 
In 2015, the different cultural organizations at USC, including the Black Student Assembly, Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment and several others, pressured USC to endow the fund, which promised $50,000 a year to address issues regarding diversity and inclusion on campus.
Last month, the Daily Trojan reported on a USG Senate meeting, during which the amendment was first proposed. Many senators — along with various groups including the SAGE, BSA and the Environmental Student Assembly — felt that the fund lacked accessibility in its current state and required an amendment in order to address their concerns.
The first meeting resulted in a long, combative debate, so the senate tabled the issue for a later date. The senate had proposed a special committee that would that would help craft the new bylaw amendment. During Tuesday’s meeting, in a sharp contrast from the debate two weeks ago, the senate unanimously approved a committee, though in a slightly different form.
A few changes to the structure of the committee played into its smooth approval. The authors of the bylaw amendment, Sen. Michaela Murphy and former USG leader Mai Mizuno, will now preside as committee’s co-chairs. It will also have seats for members of the USG advocacy branch. 
But the composition of the committee’s mandated members, USG Senator Michaela Murphy said, is the most important change in sealing its approval.
In the original committee proposal, “there were people who had explicit seats at the table who might not necessarily have as nuanced an idea of the different needs of different marginalized groups on this campus,” Murphy said. “The people who are mandated to be there are the key stakeholders in these conversations.”
USG Vice President Blake Ackerman said that aside from the committee’s structural changes, a major roadblock to approving the committee was transparency about the committee’s purpose. This time around, “there was a lot more communication between everyone that needed to be involved in the conversation,” Ackerman said. 
“A lot of the hurdles were just conflict resolution,” Murphy said. “People on all sides after that senate meeting [two weeks ago] … felt like they weren’t being listened to. The biggest thing was making sure people felt healed.”
The committee will hold its first meeting sometime before Sept. 21 and it will be open to the public. 
“If issues get to a point where no one else is supporting these [diversity] initiatives, [USG] will take on that responsibility,” Murphy said.

In 2017, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry announced that incoming freshmen would have to wait a semester before they could join Greek life, citing concerns that rushing would conflict with students’ focus on academics. Already, the newly instituted policy puts a considerable financial burden on Greek organizations. Citing discriminatory practices and a restriction of the First Amendment’s freedom of association, five Greek organizations — four fraternities and one sorority —  decided to sue the University earlier this year. 
USC’s dramatic overhaul of its Greek life and a debate over its rights is a reflection of the longstanding struggle of sororities for certain rights, particularly over the banning of alcohol at sorority events. The current policy, decided at the 1998 National Panhellenic Conference, forbids its 26 sorority organizations from participating in any activities involving drinking in sorority housing. 
Executive Director of the Panhellenic Council Dani Weatherford stresses that there is “an expectation that all chapter housing facilities will be alcohol-free.” In order to host a social event, sororities are required to seek help from fraternities, meaning that they are not completely autonomous to do as they wish. Any sorority sister caught breaking the established alcohol rules faces potential consequences, including probation and fines. 
This policy presents the clear disproportionate balance of power between fraternities and sororities. Because sororities are limited in their social ventures, they are forced to go to their respective brother organizations any time they want to engage with their members.
This dynamic forces young women into sketchy situations beyond their organization’s jurisdiction. Fraternity-controlled parties can bring increased risk for sexual assault and rape. 
A study from Ohio University found that brothers are three times more likely to commit sexual assault than non-Greek affiliated men. Women in sororities are also 74 percent more likely to be raped than their peers. Fraternity culture perpetuates toxic masculinity, as it encourages the notion that men can take whatever they want, whenever they want. Since sororities often rely on fraternities for social purposes, fraternities may get the idea that they can control sorority members themselves. It is high time that sororities take that control.
Banning sororities from engaging in regular college-aged behavior — such as partying — is sexist.  Women, just like men, are entitled to free spaces where they can have fun and bond as a group. Sorority members shouldn’t be forced into uncomfortable and life-threatening situations because of a discriminatory and restrictive law put into place two decades ago. This isn’t a groundbreaking concept. Women should have the right to do as they please. 
The fact that the policy has remained unchanged is baffling, but not when one looks at the overwhelming statistics and prevailing attitudes in society. About two-thirds of women believe that sorority policy should remain unchanged, according to a 2014 poll from YouGov. Many believe that spaces with alcohol can be dangerous for college students, and think that sorority houses should be no exception. However, this fails to address the root of the issue, which is that college-aged women are going to drink, and it is statistically much safer for them to do it in the security of their homes. Internalized misogyny prevents many sorority sisters from speaking out on the injustice they face. Silence from various fraternities at the University and on the national level with the prevalence of this outdated policy, hinders real change from being made. 
As the University works to overhaul its Greek system, it should also strongly consider reforming the outdated restrictions placed on sororities. The safety and comfort of young women depend on it.

There are no hard and fast rules to etiquette on social media — that’s what makes it exciting. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about blocking, an online function that is, by nature, antisocial and appears antithetical to the goals of social platforms. Experts have yet to fully analyze the possible motivations behind blocking others online and the effects they may have on the human brain and body.
Although there are no concrete scientific reasons as to why we block others, the act is commonly viewed as a last-resort action — a form of digital escapism. Public figures with large Twitter followings have been criticized for blocking users online, and earlier this year a federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump is not authorized to block Twitter users who criticize him because that action violates the First Amendment. 
According to a cyberpsychologist quoted in a Quartz article, blocking is “a hasty, emotion-based response to a stressful event, which may turn a difficult relationship phase into a non-salvageable one.”  
However, this loose definition discounts the millions of people, especially women and members of the LGBTQ+ community, who block users to circumvent the threats and harassment they receive online. On Monday, acclaimed author Celeste Ng posed a question to her followers about the most effective way to limit harassers on Twitter: “I’ve always muted, but recently someone pointed out blocking is like herd immunity: spares your followers from seeing the bile & prevents harassers from harassing them too. Thoughts?” 
Similar to Ng, I tend to mute people online, rather than block them. I’ve always been a firm believer in engaging in critical dialogue with others online, but as I’ve spent my time in Twitter circles, following popular writers and creatives, I’ve noticed a concerning trend: Women of color, specifically Asian women whose work and ideas I admire, are constantly speaking out about the online harassment they receive, even from others within the Asian community. The idea that blocking is a form of intellectual immaturity, that it’s an emotional and rash action, is especially harmful. It constructs a myth that people who block — especially women, who are more concerned and affected by online harassment than men — are hypersensitive or easily offended. 
This summer, “Star Wars” actress Kelly Marie Tran wiped out her Instagram posts to escape the constant harassment she received. But even lower-profile figures, such as bloggers and activists, face trolls and harassers with misogynistic ideas that they should not bother to confront.
The digital world is messy; it’s hasty and emotional, but women too often bear the burden of having to entertain arguments to the most basic opinions they express online. No person, unless they are elected officials, should be expected to listen to the concerns of everyone else. Roxane Gay, author of “Bad Feminist,” summarized it best in a tweet from March 2018: “I don’t owe anyone my time! I don’t have to participate in debates other people want to have. Goodnight.” 
Admittedly, Gay has blocked or ignored valid criticisms of her opinions and work online, but the notion that she has a binding responsibility to respond to these comments, or even acknowledge them, is absurd.
The social media landscape is not like a college classroom, where different perspectives are proposed and debated. These platforms are self-serving, and therefore allow individuals the right to make social connections and interactions with those they are willing to engage with. 
Blocking ultimately serves as an immediate coping mechanism to this stressful online world, whether the block is directed toward former lovers, friends or even disagreeable public figures. It provides users with a sense of power and control over the events and relationships in their life. It’s an action that frees people from potential interaction with individuals they would never want to interact with. If you disagree with that — well, I guess you can block me.
