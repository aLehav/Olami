Eat See Hear: The Shining, Oct. 26, 4:30 p.m.
1245 N. Spring St., Los Angeles, CA 90012
Here’s Johnny! Eat See Hear returns to Downtown Los Angeles with a screening of Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining. The event will take place in L.A. State Historic Park and admission is $12 for early birds, and $20 for late arrivals (“Fashionably Late” tickets). If you didn’t pack a picnic dinner, don’t worry: Food trucks will be on site, including the Korean chicken wing and slider truck Belly Bombz, which will be serving up crispy pork belly sliders and inventive chicken wing flavors such as Soy Caramel and Sriracha Lime.
L.A. Sriracha Festival, Oct. 27, 3:00 p.m.
613 Imperial St., Los Angeles, CA 90021
Speaking of Sriracha — the first ever Los Angeles Sriracha Festival is coming to Lot 613 this Sunday. The food-centered event will feature multiple food takes on everyone’s favorite Southeast Asian hot sauce. The list of chefs preparing dishes for the event reads like a who’s who in Los Angeles’ dining scene: Jazz Singsanong of Jitlada and Eric Greenspan of The Foundry are just a couple of the city’s dining luminaries who promise to light up the palate with Sriracha-inspired dishes — including a rumored Sriracha-flavored dessert.
Yeezus Tour, Oct. 26 and Oct. 28, 8:00 p.m.
1111 S. Figueroa St., Los Angeles, CA 90015
Yeezy season is approaching — forget whatever else you’re doing. It’s a testament to Kanye West’s cultural significance that he managed to get one of hip-hop’s hottest artists, Compton native Kendrick Lamar, to open for him. West might be a publicist’s worst nightmare, but few, if any, are disappointed by the energy of his tour performances. If you can’t make it Saturday, call in sick Monday: this might be one of the only times you’ll be able to see West in L.A. outside the parking lot at Nobu.
Timeflies at Club Nokia, Oct. 24, 7:00 p.m.
800 W. Olympic Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90015
Cal Shapiro and Rob Resnick will be at Club Nokia Thursday with opening acts Sammy Adams and Milkman as part of the Warning Signs Tour. The duo is probably best known for its hit single “I Choose U,” which peaked at No. 6 on Billboard’s Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Tickets start at $13 on StubHub, so if you’re looking for a good time on a Thursday (it’s been hard, we know), it might be worth a trip up to L.A. Live to check out Timeflies.

It’s hard to peer into the future, but I think it’s safe to say that no other startup will ever top Facebook as the ultimate forces-you-to-become-a-stalker social network.
OK, some context here.
Last week, I posted a photo with a list of Halloween costumes on my friend’s wall. The photo was of a particularly creative option, if I may say so. The costume was “Photoshop” so, accordingly, the man featured in the photo wore the software’s logo on his stomach and had dotted lines around his body, as if selected with the lasso tool.
And this is where the trouble came in. Every time I attempted to post it to my friend’s wall, Facebook tried to tag one of our mutual friends. Why? I honestly couldn’t tell you. After all, I don’t upload many photos, so I’m not sure I’ve ever attempted to tag this particular friend in my life (or at least my Facebook life). Plus, the guy Facebook was insistent on tagging had grown a beard and, with it, especially looked nothing like the Photoshop costume model. Obviously, Facebook was behind the times.
After about three tries, I finally saw the slightly transparent “X” button to untag him.
Post went up. Got some likes. Done and done.
Then I thought about it a little more. And isn’t it slightly frightening that Facebook stores information (or tries to store information) about our physical identities? In a world in which we grow increasingly wary of the National Security Administration for tapping into our phones or reading our emails, the fact that Facebook can match (or try to match) us by our visual appearance is an issue of privacy that we don’t often think about.
Surely, on the surface, there is little to complain about. After all, we are the ones to willingly give over this information to Facebook. And, truth be told, this type of facial recognition often makes things, such as tagging on Facebook, more convenient.
Still, it’s a double-edged sword.
“There are obviously useful applications, like automatically tagging your buddies in a social-network photo or — on an entirely different scale — recognizing known terrorists at airports,” wrote the San Francisco Chronicle’s James Temple back in June 2012. “But there are frightening ones as well: allowing authoritarian states to identify peaceful protesters, enabling companies to accrue ever greater insight into private lives or empowering criminals to dig up sensitive information about strangers.”
So while facial recognition might often yield benefits, it’s also a cause for concern. And it’s a #21stCenturyFear in the truest sense because it is indicative of a lack of control over who gets to access our technological identity.
There is now software for high-end retail stores that will identify when a famous guest is shopping in the store.
“If a face is a match, the program sends an alert to staff via computer, iPad or smartphone, providing details like dress size, favorite buys or shopping history,” according to NPR.
In a world in which we care about protecting our identities, it’s surprising that there’s little discussion about the collection of our physical information.
And when I say we care about protecting our identities, I mean we really care about protecting our identities. Just yesterday, I was at a coffee shop and asked for a cup of water. I hadn’t stopped at the ATM yet so I didn’t have cash or change on me. And so, when I was told that the cup of water would cost 50 cents, I had no choice but to pay with my credit card. As I went to pay, I was asked to show my ID.
I was honestly a little taken aback. In general, I believe checking one’s ID to confirm the identity on a credit card is a good thing. But, really, did they honestly think I had stolen a credit card to purchase a 50-cent cup of water? That thought is almost as crazy as the fact that they were charging me for water to begin with.
But that says a lot about how much we care about protecting identity and identity theft. And, as I said before, that’s a good thing.
Given the degree to which we care about protecting identity, it’s interesting that we don’t often talk about protecting our physical identities on the Internet. Perhaps it’s a result of the consequences being more abstract. It’s hard to imagine we would be terribly affected financially because software can recognize our face. Whereas it is quite easy to see one being financially impacted because one is using a credit card under his or her name.
Still, it’s something worth thinking about, discussing and debating. After all, it is the appearance of our face that we, more often than not, use to confirm our identity, whether it be at the airport or simply attempting to purchase a cup of water.

Life is but a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage — or at least it is for an actor diving into Macbeth. The ambitious tragedy is tackled anew by the Savage Players, a quaint ensemble that aims to bequeath the often dusty drama with fresh life. The production presents itself as a version that resonates with current society, and strives to bridge the gap between itself and the more traditional with familiar references. Director Alex Levy’s interpretation forages desperately to find relevance in 21st century, but the modern spin feels, at times, lost in translation. The anachronistic presentation creates an awkward tension with the audience that is never fully reconciled.

For those unfamiliar with Shakespeare’s beautiful dark twisted tragedy, the eponymous Macbeth is a war hero who schemes to murder his way to the throne after being influenced by the prophecy of three mysterious witches who forecast his reign. Rife with bloody deeds, stinging rhyming couplets and the unquenchable thirst for power, the cursed Scottish Play stands among Shakespeare’s best works.
Before the first witch cackles the play’s opening lines, a woman floats toward the center of the room as if in a trance, illuminated only by the iconic logo of her Apple laptop. The crackle of news media permeates the room, offering snippets of updates about an ongoing war. After a needlessly long briefing on a war that will end as the eponymous hero takes center stage, the woman closes the laptop and exits without a word.
The next scene abruptly transitions to the witches, who are perched upon the production’s only set piece: scaffolding. The witches mime frantic typing as the speakers blast the clunk of old-fashioned typewriter keys. As if they were journalists in a newsroom, they exchange papers and folders as they chant.
The change in style, from retro to glossy-new, disrupts the illusion of 21st-century relevancy proposed by the preceding scene. And if the witches are intended to be relics from the past intruding upon the present to meddle with the future, this purpose is not immediately clear.
Furthermore, war heroes Macbeth and Banquo ditch their Scottish armor for camouflage, combat boots and dog tags. This marries relatively well with the play’s attempt at a present-day theme, but away from the battle scene, Macbeth dons a crisp button-up while Banquo dresses in Western attire. These references too are lost, and the clashing styles tug the play’s setting in opposite directions.
It seems more often than not that references are thrown in as they make sense on a scene-to-scene basis: Lady Macbeth reads a letter from her husband on her iPhone, the play’s party scene features bass-happy music and raucous toasting and Macbeth’s hit men look like grimy ’90s New Yorkers. These attempts are few and far between, however, as the play’s bare stage often negates these additions.
The actors occupy a stage several strides long and half as many across. The set, designed in a miniature in-the-round in the theater — more accurately a studio space — has two doors at either end, several small windows on one side and a panel of shrouded mirrors on the other and with a small staircase leading to an attic. The space is supposed to kindle an intimacy and heighten intensity by removing the boundaries between audience and actor.
The actors might be physically closer, but they still feel just as far away as they would in a typical theater — unless Hecate the witch happens to makes eye contact. It’s more likely, though, that during the lapses of action, you’ll catch the gaze of a fellow audience member or watch them absentmindedly sip their wine.
The shape of the space also invites the unfortunate circumstance of staring directly into an actor’s back, calling to mind the expression, “You make a better door than a window.” Depending on which folding chair you’ve selected for the night, you might also find yourself craning your neck a little in order to catch all the action.
Still, what the production lacks in coherency and meticulousness, it makes up for in resourcefulness and heart. With few tools at its disposal, the ensemble utilizes the space’s levels and doors to make impactful entrances. In the play’s most compelling scene, Hectate summons the spirits to frighten Macbeth and a cast of dimly-lit ghouls materialize in the windows on the far wall (pick a seat facing the windows if you want to witness this).
Though some characters stumbled through Shakespeare’s poetic tongue-twisters (the infamously difficult “Horror! Horror! Horror!” line, however, was not flubbed), it was clear that the cast threw themselves into their performances.
Macbeth, played by Colin Simon, grows steadily more manic and desperate as his hair becomes more spikey and uncontrolled. He plays opposite his foil, an unflinching and cool MacDuff portrayed by Joe Tower, and a feisty but collected Lady Macbeth, played by Adrienne Hertler. The standout in the ensemble goes to the powerful, unflappable Michelle Holmes, whose ringing bravado as Hectate very nearly causes goosebumps.
Though this production of Macbeth might not serve to transform the Shakespeare-phobic, it does its job incarnating the lines from the pages and ultimately, does the Bard’s work justice.
 
Macbeth runs through Nov. 17, with show times Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 7 p.m. at Live Arts Los Angeles.

Syrian musician Omar Souleyman released his newest album Wenu Wenu on Tuesday, ending the anticipation surrounding the release by the increasingly popular musician providing music festival dance floor staples.

One of the most exciting aspects of Souleyman’s album is the enlisted help of electronic musician Kieran Hebden, better known to the music community as Four Tet. Souleyman’s decision to work with one of the most popular electronic musicians today speaks to his growing profile in the indie music community.
“Wenu Wenu,” the first track on the album that was released as a single earlier this year, is destined to become a dance staple at house parties and DJ sets. Driving percussive beats, a sultry melodic line and catchy lyrics, even if they aren’t in English, are sure to make this single a crossover for the less adventurous world music listeners.
For the rest of Souleyman’s fanbase, the remainder of the album gives plenty of challenging material to work with.
Souleyman maintains the traditional sounds of dabke dance music, but infuses his music with electronic elements, adding a fresh new sound to his music. Hazy melodies and insistent, pulsating rhythms provide a psychedelic experience, verging at moments on the surreal.
Given that Souleyman sings in Arabic and Kurdish, the lack of English in the album challenges listeners to maintain their attention throughout the entire record. The undeniably addicting music, however, provides listeners with plenty of appeal to make the entire record an enjoyable sonic experience.
The last two tracks of the album, “Mawal Jamar” and “Yagbuni,” prove to be the most accessible for listeners new to the rhythms and tones of Middle Eastern music. Both of the tracks feature more melodic variations and mellow instrumentation, which is sure to draw in listeners interested in becoming more exposed to world music.
Souleyman’s trajectory as a musician is promising for other non-Western musicians looking to break into the American music scene. Souleyman, who began as a wedding singer, managed to reach U.S. audiences through his work with the American label Sublime Frequencies.
Though it was a stateside label that gave Souleyman the push to break into the U.S., it is his experimental strain that has allowed him to flourish among American listeners. Souleyman is indicative of the musical rewards that come with combing sounds of other cultures for fresh new music.
Souleyman’s success is an encouraging sign that young adult audiences are reaching out for sounds from all across the globe, a trend that is sure to produce an increasingly fascinating strain of musical fusion with different genres. Souleyman might be mixing old and the new, the traditional and the electronic, but there is no telling how his music will end up being interpreted by his contemporaries and future generations of musicians.
For listeners who share a cultural background similar to Souleyman’s, the first question that comes to mind is why Souleyman’s work is any different from the myriad Middle Eastern musicians from past decades or contemporary times.
The answer to that lies in Souleyman’s variability among his tracks and his astonishing work incorporating electronic music into his pieces in a way that is fresh and challenging and not mindlessly repetitive.
For listeners that grew up listening to music similar to Souleyman’s at birthdays and weddings, Wenu Wenu still provides a rich musical experience because of its experimental nature.
Listeners should not take Souleyman’s album to be indicative of the typical performance of Middle Eastern music. Souleyman’s sounds are meant to be heard in a group dance setting, and though the tracks are infectious, they do not speak to the improvisational energy that characterizes his live performances.
There is a reason why Souleyman’s live performances in the United States become massive dance parties, not passive listening experiences.
Though Souleyman has released an excellent record, his music verges on being relegated as a token world music performer at American music festivals. What listeners should take away from this album is the desire to move beyond a single record and explore the massive musical tradition that backs Souleyman and his work.
Souleyman’s influences are just a small section of the larger scope of Middle Eastern music. Listeners should take Wenu Wenu as a jumping off point for a rewarding exploration of the myriad beautiful and challenging music that comes out of non-Western musical traditions.
For fans and detractors of Souleyman’s work, Wenu Wenu serves as a gateway to a vast array of music that can become quite different from Souleyman’s style — music that offers the possibility of an exciting realm of fusion sounds.
Souleyman has staying power among American listeners. What he offers beyond his music is a chance for listeners to expand their understanding of what Middle Eastern music is, and how other musical traditions can offer a listening experience that is just as engaging as a Radiohead or Kendrick Lamar album.

The fearless men and women of Congress can rest easy at night knowing that no matter how bad things get on the Hill, Americans will still view their representatives in Washington in a more favorable light than some other things. That list, however, is shrinking.
According to results of a survey by the Public Policy Polling Institute, Americans view witches, hemorrhoids and cockroaches more favorably than their representatives in Congress.
A poll by CNN noted that this puts Congress, and more specifically the GOP, in a dire situation: With just over a year until midterm elections, 75 percent of respondents believed most Republican representatives in Congress should not be reelected. The poll found that respondents blamed Congressional Republicans more than Democrats for the government shutdown. Overall, a CBS News Poll showed that the Congressional disapproval rate rests at 85 percent — the highest since the poll began in 1977.
These polls might be bleak, but the next legislative agenda item, comprehensive immigration reform, offers both the GOP and Congress an opportunity to prove to the American public that Congress can actually be productive.
Immigration reform, which passed in the Senate over the summer, failed in the House of Representatives after it was unable to garner majority support. The biggest obstacle immigration reform faces this time is convincing a majority of House Republicans to go against the nebulous Hastert Rule used by Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) to justify not bringing the bill to a vote over the summer.
Many voices within the party are touting immigration reform as the gateway to a better relationship with Latino voters. Moreover, most of the components of reform are favored by a large majority of voters. The International Business Times reported that more than 50 percent of voters support implementing an electronic system that will allow employers to check the immigration status of employees, a path to citizenship for the undocumented, a system to ensure people who enter the country leave it, more visas for highly skilled workers and an increase in border security.
The hard line to walk for the GOP in regards to immigration reform, however, is that if the legislation is passed, the political benefits from it would be shared with President Barack Obama and the Democrats. The last thing Congressional Republicans want to do is hand Obama a victory on immigration: Despite its popularity with voters, as long as immigration reform is a win for Obama, it can succeed.
In some capacity, Republicans recognize the necessity of immigration reform happening, which is why they’ve begun passing piecemeal bits of reform. Still, Republicans loathe the idea of helping Obama score back-to-back wins on the debt ceiling and immigration. For immigration reform to pass by the end of the year, expect a long-fought battle: The GOP will stand firm, but if Obama displays the same kind of backbone that he displayed over the shutdown, a deal seems inevitable.
The impending debate over immigration reform will be largely indicative of the future of the GOP.  The test for the Republican Party leadership, and Boehner in particular, is to show how ignoring the Hastert Rule and passing policy is more important than scoring political points. It sounds crazy, but it’s happened before.
One of the main signs for optimism is government productivity in the wake of the 1996 government shutdown. After the 1996 shutdown engineered by then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich was resolved, a spirit of productivity descended upon the Republican Party. Congress increased the minimum wage, enacted welfare reform and passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care law.
Our congressmen have an added incentive to make a deal happen: The aforementioned PPPI poll revealed that Americans still prefer Congress to Miley Cyrus, but that gap is closing, possibly because the actions of Congress seem to be the political equivalent of twerking on national television. The sooner Washington realizes this, the sooner they might actually work together and get it right.

GOP will not introduce a bill because then it would force a conference with the Dems. And, as Reid has said, “We’ll get our own bill anyway.”

Also, GOP’s numbers will rise.  Obama’s numbers are also dismal.
The “majority” of voters for CIR want secure borders, etc. first before discussing amnesty.
Check out recent NBC poll that 68%-75% of The American Center (in politics, representing 72% of voters) do not want amnesty for Illegal Aliens. Spread this info around:

Malala Yousafzai, now 16 years old, has become an international icon for advocating girls’ right to attend schools without fear of persecution. She has delivered speeches at the United Nations headquarters, published a biography, I am Malala, and most recently, charmed Jon Stewart with an articulate interview on The Daily Show. Her fight is a global struggle: According to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, currently 66 million girls are out of school.

Because of her achievements, many favored her to become the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which she was nominated for this year. But on Oct. 11, the second annual International Day of the Girl, Yousafzai was not chosen as the winner. Instead, the award was given to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for its “extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons.”
Many were disappointed when Yousafzai was not chosen, but they should save their frustration: Yousafzai is probably better off without the award in the first place. The Nobel Peace Prize is not worth the attention and hype that society gives it.
First and foremost, the prize itself has questionable standards. There is simply no consistent method to determining who deserves this well-known award. Alfred Nobel, the founder of the prize, stated that the peace prize would be awarded to a group or an individual that “have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies for the holding of peace congresses.”
Arguably, no committee is worthy of determining what constitutes as the “most or best work” for promoting peace. After all, it can be asserted that all individuals actively fighting for a righteous cause deserve recognition. How does one measure peace and its lasting effects? These are all issues that emphasize the subjectivity of the prize. Evidently, this would create lasting controversy when certain individuals are chosen.
Take President Barack Obama, for example. The president was awarded the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize for “creating a new climate in international politics” and his work toward “a world without nuclear weapons.” Keeping in mind that Obama was only nine months into his first presidency, when he was selected for the award. Many noted that Obama did not make any significant steps toward improving international political climate, as all he did was travel through various states abroad and promote goodwill to different governments and their people. Some also noted that his selection was based on “popularity” seeing as he was well-received not only in United States during the 2008 election, but also among the rest of the world, which saw him as a breath of fresh air for the United States.
The Nobel Peace Prize is mediocre at best — the hype and attention surrounding the prize nomination and award simply feeds into a false sense of importance that these prizes mean something. Yousafzai does not need such an ambiguous award to further her cause. Her activism and eloquence alone have already allowed her to grab the attention of the world to regarding the issue of girls’ education.
The Pakistani teenager has a lifetime of achievement waiting for her in the future. As she develops her advocacy for girls’ rights to education, she will become a true leader, and will continue to inspire the world with her activism. Awarding her a title will simply limit her accomplishments to the achievements she has made up to this point.
Put simply, Yousafzai is too good for the Nobel Peace Prize — as a young woman who triumphed over the brutality of the Taliban, she is a champion in her own right, whose potential knows no bounds.

I was so very impressed when on the Daily Show, she said at first she would want respond to those oppressing her by hitting them with her shoe, and then said she felt that would make her as bad as them.
To be so committed to non-violence in the face of such danger is truly remarkable.
I think they should have given it to Obama again.  
That empty suit – bastion of liberal values – has shown us all just how vapid the prize is in the first place.
