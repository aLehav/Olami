When Sahil Lavingia goes into business meetings, he is usually the youngest one in the room. At 19 years old, he is the owner and creator of Internet start-up Gumroad and has a professional résumé that includes Pinterest and Turntable but said his age has never held him back.
Pinterest, a site that allows viewers to share media through a virtual pinboard, is the third most popular social network, according to VentureBeat, which covers new technology.
“I joined [Pinterest] when I was 18 and everyone else was around 30,” he said. “It was amazing. I don’t think age was a factor. It was just really cool to learn with people who cared about the project.”
Lavingia was a first-semester freshman studying computer engineering at USC in fall 2010 when Pinterest co-founder Ben Silbermann approached him to help design Pinterest. At the time, Lavingia was designing iPhone apps and working on websites. He said Silbermann found him through his blog.
“[He] emailed me and said that he liked a lot of my work,” Lavingia said. “Next time I was up in NorCal, I met with him and the other founder and talked about products. In the end, I liked what they were up to and I told them I would join them.”
After one semester at USC, Lavingia decided to end his formal education at USC and move to San Francisco to begin a different type of education as a full-time employee.
“Education is pretty different from learning,” he said. “I thought I would learn a lot more being up in San Francisco full-time. I’d be really immersed in the start-up scene rather than paying USC $50,000 a year.”
Lavingia designed Pinterest’s signature virtual pinboard. Previously, he designed and built iPhone apps including one for Turntable.fm, which allows users to share music in a social setting. He said he was about 13 when he started learning computer programs, such as Photoshop, and soon began designing iPhone apps. He said he became “addicted to making stuff.”
“When you build an app, it might take you a few hours to make and it could change someone’s life,” he said. “I think the coolest thing about working on Gumroad is it gives you the opportunity to do the same thing.”
Soon after joining Pinterest, Lavingia said he created Gumroad, a website for selling creative content, after he spent a few hours one day designing a pencil logo on Photoshop. He said he realized there was no easily accessible market model where he could use to sell the design online.
“I thought there could be a new one based on social [networking], so I built the prototype in a weekend,” he said. “The biggest goal is to change the way people create, consume and pay for content.”
Lavingia said he was frustrated with current market models, where consumers might hear a song on the radio but have to go another place, such as iTunes, to buy the song. He wanted to change the way artists create and sell their work, so he began working on Gumroad as a side project. After about a year with Pinterest, he left for Gumroad, taking with him everything he learned, including remembering to have fun.
“I don’t really care about the business. I don’t really care about the $8 million we could raise,” he said. “I just care about the product. It’s just fun.”
Lavingia said Gumroad has already seen success, reaching out to a variety of artists looking for an easy way to get their work out, whether it is music, writing or artwork. Despite his age, he said he never feels out of place among other, older creators of Silicon Valley start-ups such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and he never feels uncomfortable with the responsibilities of owning a company.
“My favorite part of that is that if everything fails, it’s totally my fault,” he said. “I’m sure there [are] tons of mistakes I’ve made and tons of mistakes I’ll make in the future. It’s cool that people trust me and give me that responsibility.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC Department of Public Safety crime/incident summary between Friday, June 8, and Monday, June 11.
Crimes against a person
At 4:00 p.m. on June 10,  a suspect approached a juvenile who was seated on a bicycle outside 1335 35th St. and grabbed hold of the handle bars. The suspect began searching the juvenile’s pockets and a struggle ensued when he removed a set of keys. The juvenile fell to the ground and the suspect slapped him in the face repeatedly before walking away with the keys. The suspect was detained by DPS officers who responded to the scene and he was subsequently arrested and transported to the Southwest station for booking.
At 4:39 a.m. on June 10, a suspect tore open a window screen at 1016 23rd St. and was confronted by a resident as he attempted to gain entry. The suspect then fled on foot and could not be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers.
At 7:25 p.m. on June 9, two suspects approached a non-USC male from behind while he was walking through the parking lot at St. John’s Church; one of them punched him in the face. The male fell to the ground and one of the suspects demanded his money. The suspect then forcibly removed currency from the male’s pockets and walked away with the second suspect. The male did not report the incident at the time it occurred, so DPS officers were unable to conduct a search for the suspects.
At 11:41 a.m. on June 9, DPS officers responded to a non-USC male who was struck by a vehicle while riding his bicycle on Exposition Boulevard and Trousdale Parkway. The driver of the vehicle did not stop to check on the male’s condition or identify himself, but witnesses were able to obtain the vehicle license plate number and gave it to LAPD officers who responded to conduct a traffic investigation. The male sustained an injury to his arm and an LAFD unit transported him to California Hospital for medical treatment.
At 10:43 p.m. on June 8, a student was cited to Judicial Affairs for throwing a beer bottle at a DPS officer at Sigma Alpha Epsilon and providing false information to the officers who detained him for questioning.
 
Crimes against property
At 3:25 p.m. on June 11, a suspect reached through a vending machine dispenser door in John Stauffer Science Lecture Hall and removed snack items from the lower shelves by manipulating the security door.
At 1:37 p.m. on June 11, it was reported that a suspect removed a tan 2000 Cadillac DeVille that was parked outside Olympic Gardens.
At 8:39 A.m. on June 11, it was reported that a suspect used unknown means to gain entry to a storage room and removed a vacuum from  Popovich Hall.
At 8:24 p.m. on June 10,  a student reported that a suspect removed her unattended purse from a laundry room at Troy Hall and subsequently used a credit card inside it to make several unauthorized purchases.
At 5:42 p.m. on June 10, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect driving a vehicle near Adams Boulevard and Orchard Street that was identified as stolen. The officers began following the vehicle and the driver was detained during a felony traffic stop by LAPD officers who joined the pursuit. Further investigation revealed that the driver had purchased the vehicle from a suspect who obtained it by fraudulent means, and she was subsequently released. The vehicle was then impounded ;and LAPD detectives will continue the investigation.
At 9:49 a.m. on June 10, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect eating snacks and drinking beverages inside the market at the Mobil gas station without paying for them. The officers detained the suspect and turned him over to LAPD officers who responded to the scene.
At 4:45 p.m. on June 9, a non-USC male reported that the rear passenger side fender, front passenger side door and the hood were dented and scratched while his vehicle was parked at the Exposition Boulevard Parking Structure.
 
Miscellaneous incidents
At 3:48 p.m. on June 11, DPS officers responded to a staff member who was suffering from an allergic reaction to her prescription medication at Bridge Memorial Hall. An LAFD RA unit was requested. The unit examined the staff member and offered transportation for medical treatment, but she declined and was released at the scene.
At 5:01 p.m. on June 11, DPS officers responded to a non-USC female complaining of difficulty breathing, chest pains and dizziness at the Keck Hospital of USC. A rapid response team was at the scene examining the female when the officers arrived and she was subsequently transported within the facility for medical treatment.
At 1:38 p.m. on June 10, DPS officers responded to a report of an unknown odor inside a room at the Ronald Tutor Hall of Engineering and upon their arrival they detected a faint electrical smell. LAFD was requested, but the smell had dissipated before they arrived and the source could not be located. All units then cleared the scene without further incident.
At 4:06 a.m. on June 9, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect prowling around vehicles parked in the alley behind Belaire Apartments and detained him for investigation. The suspect was released at the scene after the officers found no evidence of a crime having been committed, but a short time later a vehicle was located with pry marks on the passenger side door. No property was removed.
At 7:12 p.m. on June 8, DPS officers on routine patrol observed a suspect lying on the grass outside Century Apartments and detained her for investigation. The suspect appeared to be under the influence of a controlled substance and the officers found her in possession of two glass pipes containing possible drug residue. A check of the suspect’s name also revealed an outstanding warrant. The suspect was then arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.

To help illustrate the difficulties that military service members face when returning to universities after combat, The Soldiers Project hosted the Combat to Campus panel at the Davidson Conference Center on Saturday.
The Soldiers Project is a non-profit organization that offers free confidential psychological counseling to military service members and their families.
Service · A panel Saturday focused on the transition to college for military veterans. The discussion was part of a weekend conference. - Adrian Hoffman | Summer Trojan
Many soldiers face several physical and psychological effects after returning from their term of service, said Gail Soffer, the development director of The Soldiers Project.
“A lot of these people are suffering from traumatic brain injuries and major issues that make it difficult to pay attention or stay awake in class because they are sleep deprived,” Soffer said. “[Returning veterans] also have to deal with bureaucracy, which can be difficult since they are used to a chain of command that’s very straightforward, and a university has a very different way of operating.”
Patricia D’Orange-Martin, a speaker at the panel and the coordinator of the Veterans Resource Center at Pasadena City College, said veteran affairs are particularly important in Los Angeles and California as a whole because the state has some of the largest populations of veterans in the United States.
“It’s estimated that California has 2.2 million veterans residing here, and is the top state in the nation for the number of veterans that live here,” D’Orange-Martin said. “According to the California Department of Veterans Affairs, there’s between 60,000 and 70,000 veterans in higher education.”
Soffer said many universities should offer more services to veterans to facilitate their return and encourage their talents in the classroom.
“[TSP] should offer training for faculty and staff because they may see a student falling asleep in class or looking around in class, and they just need to understand the context for why they are behaving this way,” Soffer said. “They also shouldn’t treat [veterans] like killers or glorified heroes, but instead just like normal people,” Soffer said.
Ian Smith, a Marine veteran and music education major at California State University Northridge, said at the panel that one of the problems that many veterans face when returning to a university is their lack of pride in being a soldier.
“Up until [arriving at college], I had no interest in being involved in anything veteran, and I didn’t even like being called a veteran,” Smith said. “When someone called me a veteran of a foreign war for the first time, it [was] almost like they said something about my mom. I have these images of a veteran, like the homeless guy off the side of the freeway with a cardboard sign, and that just wasn’t me.”

Lisa Denton Barkett, an alumna of the class of 1981 and Board of Governors President of the USC Alumni Association this past year, was elected last week to a five-year term on the Board of Trustees.
As president of the Board of Governors, Barkett made several notable changes within the USC community. During her tenure, she worked to enhance the association’s visibility both on the campus and in the world, co-hosting a Trojan Family Reception in Shanghai as well as helping in organizing the association’s fourth annual USC Women’s Conference in March with the theme of “Inspired & Empowered: Moving Forward.”
Along with emphasizing the association’s role, Barkett created the USC Alumni Day of SCervice to increase community outreach. The event brought together more than 1,500 volunteers to participate in projects organized by USC alumni clubs and other affiliated groups in 18 states and nine countries.
“I am delighted to welcome Lisa Barkett to the USC Board of Trustees,” President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement. “One of our most passionate and inspiring volunteers, Lisa truly embodies the Trojan spirit of giving back. For more than two decades, she has contributed on many fronts to helping advance the academic mission of her alma mater. I look forward to the creativity and insights she will contribute as a member of our board.”
In addition to sitting on the Board of Governors since 2007, Barkett has been a dynamic member of the Trojan League Associates of San Diego County for the last 20 years.
Gov. Jerry Brown also appointed Barkett, an attorney in private practice, to the Board of Directors of the 22nd District Agricultural Association for the State of California and on the Del Mar Fairgrounds Racetrack Leasing Commission.
Barkett also serves on the Board of Trustees of Rady Children’s Hospital-San Diego.
Barkett earned her bachelor of arts degree from the USC Price School of Public Policy and a law degree from the Pepperdine University School of Law.

Major summer construction projects throughout USC are on schedule and on budget, according to Joe Back, associate senior vice president for campus development and facilities management.
Summer construction · Two construction workers look out at a covered Tommy Trojan in Hahn Plaza, one of several construction sites. The renovations are part of a larger project to improve paving and landscaping along Child’s Way. - Arkadiy Garber | Summer Trojan
The most visible summer projects include renovations to EVK Restaurant and Grill, King’s Hall, which housed Café 84, Parking Structure X and Hahn Plaza. Another summer project is the completion of the John McKay Center.
The improvements of Café 84 will draw on Whole Foods Market as a model, Director of Hospitality Kris Klinger said to the Daily Trojan in April. For the EVK renovation, Klinger said his department is looking for inspiration from True Food Kitchen, a small chain of restaurants that Klinger described as “open and bright.”
The renovations to PSX will upgrade the structure so that it is more in line with standards for new parking buildings and so that it has brick along the walls of the structure.
“Much of the structural work being done will be mostly invisible to the casual observer, but the big thing that will be noticed is the brick being added to the building to make it more compatible with nearby buildings and the overall look of the campus,” Back said.
The John McKay Center, which has been under construction for the past one and a half years, is slated for completion in late July or early August, Back said. It will provide a new and significantly larger academic center for all student-athletes, new training and workout spaces, offices for coaches and staff and a new locker room.
The upgrade to Hahn Plaza, a central point on campus, will affect the landscape and paving in the area. Though some work has been done there in the past, no renovations of this magnitude have been made, Back said.
“This is actually a continuation of work that has been taking place during the past two summers to replace and upgrade the paving and landscape along Child’s Way,” Back said. “Hahn Plaza is a major piece of that work and will be completed this summer.”
I see they finally discovered the secret underground tunnel to the Row and are making haste to destroy it.
Can we get more details about what the new Hahn Plaza will look like?
Maybe the third worker was looking at the other two who were looking at TT
“Summer construction · Two construction workers look out at a covered Tommy Trojan……… ”
There are three workers looking at Tommy :P

In a society where avid music listeners sometimes find themselves conflicted between a love of fast-paced club music and an appreciation of lyrical depth, British electronic-pop group Hot Chip has achieved the impossible. With its fifth album, In Our Heads, the group has produced dance music with genuine emotion.
The exotic, rhythmic beats of In Our Heads, coupled with lead singer Joe Goddard’s heartfelt lyrics and raw emotion, renders this new work a frivolous, fascinating listen that’s equally likely to satisfy your desires for dance, for dreams and, as unlikely as it sounds, for depth.
Hot Chip first came onto the electronic-pop culture radar with 2006 album The Warning, which garnered mass critical and popular acclaim, particularly for the infectious song “Over and Over.”
The record was ultimately shortlisted for the prestigious nationwide Mercury Prize and was named Album of the Year by British publication MixMag.
Since then, the group has performed in more than a hundred venues across the United States, Japan, Australia and Europe.
With In Our Heads, Hot Chip again captures the unique combination of rambunctiousness and relatability that made it an early fan favorite. The subject matter of most of the songs is typical of modern young songwriters: mostly love, sex and heartbreak. But the unusual diction and the similarly offbeat tunes make each song weird yet heart-wrenching.
The first song, “Motion Sickness,“ for example, is lyrically sound, but the playful beat is sure to entice you to dance along. The song is an excellent introduction to the album, providing a good sense of the album’s tone and overall quality.
The songs “How Do You Do” and “Don’t Deny Your Heart” continue to develop the album’s unique sound with its eccentric background beats.
The standout song, however, is most definitely “Flutes,” the only song on the album that exceeds seven minutes. Though lengthy, “Flutes” is the most memorable. As lead singer Joe Goddard croons, “One day you might realize / that you need to open your eyes,” it becomes clear that the song is, in essence, a soft, melancholic ode to the confused and to the lonely.
The only shame lies in that the album does not end on its high notes. The last song “Always Be Your Love” is not a bad choice to send off listeners, but it is more of a typical ballad, failing to inspire any true emotion.
Despite a lackluster finish to the album, the band’s development in finesse, in style and in heart renders In Our Heads a success. The album has already gotten stellar reviews from critics in the U.K. and in the United States, and it is sure to garner more.
With In Our Heads, Hot Chip achieves a rare feat, music that captures the pain, joy and heartbreak of life — yet still lets you dance.

Mellow electronic music played to fill the silence before the show. Inside, the light was dim, absorbed by the dark walls and floor, exemplifying a stereotypical rock music venue. It was hot, loud and smelled of old wood and fried foods.
To the sound of a roaring throng of fans last week, Ben Howard and his band walked onstage at The Troubadour on the border between West Hollywood and Beverly Hills.

But first, The Bahamas — starting an hour late — made it to the stage. Touring the West Coast with Ben Howard, The Bahamas consists of Toronto-based musician Afie Jurvanen and two female backup singers.
His music is simple and mellow, made up of nothing but singing and a single guitar. The harmonies were jazzy, and the sole guitar made The Bahamas sound much like the minstrels of a monarch’s court.
Jurvanen attempted to connect with the crowd in between songs without much success. He even admitted at one point that it’s easier back in Canada; perhaps the failure to connect can be attributed to a culture gap.
After The Bahamas finished its set and the crew quickly reset the staging, the crowed moved in closer as Ben Howard and his band took the stage.
Howard’s talented bandmates  India Bourne and Chris Bond each played multiple instruments. Bourne does a great job with the bass guitar and drums, though her cello is mediocre at best.
Bond plays the drumset as well as the rhythm and bass guitars; both musicians provided backup vocals. Along with his bandmates, Howard showed off a pleasant voice — a high tenor comparable to that of James Blunt, though softer.
Their combined vocalizing were perfect for Howard’s songs, which were all emotionally charged. Most of Howard’s material consists of love songs, such as “Only Love,” where Howard asks his lover to shelter him and in return he would give himself over completely.
Others are more depressing: “Diamonds” begins with “All I am is the bones you made for me / So garishly clean.” All his works have one quality in common: They’re repetitive. Every song needs a chorus or bridge that repeats and gives it cohesiveness, but it seems that most of Howard’s songs consist of nothing but these recurrences.
On top of this, Howard’s tunes often lack originality, many of his songs sounded like some sort of cross between Jack Johnson and Mumford and Sons.
But he had some tricks up his sleeve — Howard played his guitar on his lap to add beats while playing the string during “Depth Over Distance.” The song featured a mellow melody and minimal accompaniment, creating a sound reminiscent of much of Johnson’s works.
Howard also flaunted some fretboard skills, as well. In “The Fear,” he quickly fingered a flurry of notes on his guitar as the other two members of the band provided heavy, bass drum beats.
The band had good chemistry with the attendees, throwing around jokes about the venue resembling a strip club. Howard and Bourne even recognized some people from a previous performance and briefly reminisced with the overjoyed fans.
At one point, Howard revealed he was so nervous he wore a pair of his lucky underwear, which Bourne convinced him to show.
Ben Howard truly connected with his audience as nearly everyone kept beat by dancing or clapping. The music is catchy and the lyrics are relatable, though often mumbled. Despite Howard’s sound not being entirely new, his show proved he has the wide appeal to keep a venue thrumming to his tunes.

From a comic strip to a television sitcom to the big screen, the Addams family has experienced myriad reincarnations. With the intention to revitalize and grow the characters and story, the Broadway musical take on the macabre family was created in 2010 and later altered for its Los Angeles premiere.
Even though the musical has been reworked and given a makeover to remove some skeletons from the closet, be warned: Many demons continue to haunt this production.

Overall, the show is basic musical fare. Over-the-top, articulated acting, shallow characters and simple plot lines create a generic spectacle that caters especially well to casual musical enthusiasts and nostalgic fans of the Addams family cash-cow franchise.
The stock musical elements of the show flaunt nothing groundbreaking and often seem to suffocate what should be a lively, creepy and kooky cast of characters. Hardly timely jokes about Charlie Sheen and teenagers texting are universal enough to merit a laugh, but the jokes serve no other purpose than to elicit cheap giggles; The Addams Family falters in its lack of motive: The show is all skin and bones — no meat.
The characters Gomez (Douglas Sills) and Morticia (Sara Gettelfinger) are as superficial and underdeveloped as possible — lifeless by any sense of the word. Each character is so directed and calculated that actions become predictable and forced, with the players trapped inside Marshall Brickman’s and Rick Elice’s dark writing.
Moreover, the book is simple and uninteresting. The Addams family is known for being off its rockers, but the only off-kilter aspects of the script seem to be the perpetually overused jokes about death. The one aspect that separates the Addams from a “normal” family here makes them unbearable and cliché. The writers corner the story into a graveyard rendition of “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” and appear to have had only so many options for development after that.
Fear not: Every thematic idea has been explored, but that’s not necessarily a good thing.
The schizophrenic direction of the story inconsistently floats between lecturing on honesty being the best policy, reminding families that blood is thicker than water and beating to death the connotations of the word “normal.” Though the themes are not necessarily poor topics, none feel executed in a complete and creative manner.
But shallow characters, simple plot lines and superficial morals can be ingredients of a hit Broadway musical. It’s the spectacle — the song, dance, set and costumes — that wills a show to life. But as with the characters and story, the majority of The Addams Family’s theatrical elements are ghastly.
From the Big Apple to Hollywood, The Addams Family saw a revision of almost half of its musical numbers. But if the themes of the show have as many personalities as the living members of the Addams family, the score has as many as the living and dead combined. Gomez’s heritage inspires Flamenco castanets and Spanish guitar, while the Broadway-influenced ballad “Just Around the Corner” and uptempo ditty “Full Disclosure” stretch the orchestration to extremes. With no determined musical theme to tie every piece together, the songs merely add more confusion to the spectacle.
If there’s a redeeming musical number in the entirety of the show — not counting the terribly under-milked Addams Family theme song — it’s Uncle Fester’s ode to the moon in “The Moon and Me,” which embodies what this production could have been: mysterious, spooky and inventive. This one scene is pure Broadway magic, complete with a zero-gravity Uncle Fester, lyrical whimsy and what the show is constantly lacking — a true beating heart.
The trouble with The Addams Family is that it relies on fan loyalty and nostalgic memories of the beloved characters to carry the two-and-a-half-hour-long production. But devotion can only go so far when Cousin Itt is granted a meager 10 seconds of “face” time. That may be redeemed by Lurch’s angelic surprise during the awkward finale “Move Toward the Darkness,” but it’s not enough to save the show.
If it’s any consolation, The Addams Family musical is all together ooky. The writers got something right.
 
The Addams Family ends its  run at the Pantages Theatre June 17.

Few films are as explicit about their themes as Prometheus. Where do we come from? Why are we here? What would our creator say if it saw us now? The characters in Ridley Scott’s highly anticipated return to science fiction ask these and other similar questions as they investigate the potential origin of the human species — an origin that might have come from light years away.
Problem in space · Charlize Theron and Idris Elba star as two space voyagers who wind up fighting for their lives in a future galaxy. Many viewers claim that Prometheus could be a prequel to Alien. - Photo courtesy of Kerry Brown
Noomi Rapace plays the expedition’s lead scientist, who believes that humankind was created by some sort of extraterrestrial race and that these alien engineers must therefore hold the answers to the important questions. In essense, she literally seeks God.
It’s all a bit blatant, no doubt, but the fact that the film wears its thematic intentions on its sleeve isn’t inherently a misstep. The overt approach can often work fine in exciting, big budget fare like this — look no further than Sarah Connor carving out Terminator 2’s “NO FATE” maxim with a knife.  No, where Prometheus goes wrong is in falling short of answering these age-old inquiries into the beginnings of mankind with an unconvincing protagonist and a loosely constructed story, failing to add an insightful voice to the discussion on all of its whys, wheres and hows.
Much of the blame lies with Rapace’s Elizabeth Shaw. She’s referred to as a “true believer” early on, and the screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Lost showrunner Damon Lindelof — unsurprising, considering the ABC phenomenon’s obvious theology — doesn’t provide enough evidence to convince viewers that she’ll go to any real lengths to affirm her beliefs.
Sure, all her actions work toward that goal. But her attitude doesn’t sell it: She lacks the passion, anger, and raw fanatic conviction to justify her choices, and though the film sympathizes her point of view, it rings hollow.  And because the last act relies on her — and specifically, her “deep-seated” resolve — as an anchor, the whole movie practically falls apart.
It’s an ending made all the more frustrating considering Prometheus has a lot going for it. The visual design is perhaps the best that science fiction has enjoyed in a decade, with awesome environments, sleek digital readouts and unspeakably disturbing horrors all rendered in effective, unobtrusive 3-D. Purely from a visual standpoint, the film is never boring.
Then there are the few supporting performances that manage to stand out. Charlize Theron is all business and self-preservation, exuding icy dismissal in a way that raises a lot of questions about her character that, unfortunately, are explained in a cartoonishly over-the-top reveal. Idris Elba, however, only gets better as the film goes on, effectively playing the workingman captain who wants to do his job right while lightening the mood where he can. He’s the most likable person on board — unless Michael Fassbender, as the android David, can be considered a person.
Fassbender gives the best performance by far as a curious and amiable synthetic man who, though talked down to by practically everyone on board, gives the distinct impression that he’s above them all, only humoring the homo sapiens because that’s what he was programmed for. How ironic -— intentionally, one hopes — that the most sympathetic character in a film about our creation isn’t human himself, but merely our best attempt at crafting intelligent life out of nothing.
On the subject of intelligent life, it doesn’t help that the so-called scientists in Prometheus make an inexcusable number of mind-numbingly stupid decisions. They take off their helmets and breathe in the alien air, get lost despite their high-tech map-making technology, lose track of each other in what can only be continuity errors and treat an unfamiliar life form as a friendly pet even when the most animal-loving of audience members would, with one glance, describe the creature in question as a deadly space cobra.
There are far too many moments in which the characters do things that no thinking person ever would, continually reminding viewers that beneath all the visual fidelity and brilliance from Fassbender lies a script that could have used a lot more work.
Though it has many strong sequences — one scene involving automated surgery is impossible to watch without slack-jawed, terrified astonishment — and truly aspires to be more than the average blockbuster, Prometheus ultimately loses its footing not because it doesn’t provide answers, but because it doesn’t do enough to sway viewers over to its point of view.
Prometheus is rooted in one of the most revered properties in all science fiction — Alien — and tackles the engineering of humanity. By the time the credits roll, however, it’s only cheapened the Alien mythology (especially in the pointless final scene) while adding nothing of note to the philosophies it desperately trumpets. It is the very definition of disappointment: A small thing, from great beginnings.
Seriously, how in god’s name did Ridley Scott mess this up? Oh yeah: he hired a writer whose calling card was a TV show that ultimately failed to follow through with its half-baked ideas by the time the final season rolled around. What a disappointment Prometheus was. Such a great cast and incredible production design, all torpedoed by a lackluster script and a once great director who should have known better.

The California State Assembly passed a measure June 1 to create a state board to enact and enforce clearer regulations regarding the growing, transportation and distribution of medical marijuana.
A measure like this once again begs the question: Why isn’t marijuana legal yet if we have the potential to regulate the production and use of marijuana? 
A 2011 survey published by Time states that as many as 42 percent of Americans have tried pot. If marijuana’s illegality isn’t enough to keep people from smoking it, perhaps it’s time the government took a different approach.
The legalization of marijuana would allow for the immediate generation of billions of dollars of tax revenue through the taxation of production and sale. More importantly, what legislators need to realize is that legal marijuana would not only generate revenue but save it as well, by stopping the waste of billions of taxpayer dollars a year in an unnecessary drug war.
Here’s a hypothetical example of that: Enter Jane, a recent college graduate who gets arrested for possession of marijuana. Jane loses her job and is forced to pay a hefty fine. She is no longer able to make purchases to stimulate the economy and now collects unemployment checks. And because of time spent in court and looking for a job, Jane is no longer able to volunteer on weekends as often as she used to.
Significantly, it is the legal action Jane faces and not the marijuana she smokes that leads to her becoming an unproductive member of society.
The Drug Enforcement Administration spends a considerable amount of its $2-billion budget each year pursuing and prosecuting “criminals” like Jane, many of whom are otherwise law-abiding citizens. Billions more are spent by states and cities independently trying to control the drug. In New York City alone, more than 50,000 people were arrested for possession of marijuana in 2011, costing the city an estimated $75 million.
Obviously, this is money that could be spent on everything from public education to controlling far more dangerous drugs.
Marijuana’s lamented role as a gateway drug is also made worse by its illegal status. The DEA classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 substance for supposedly having a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use and a lack of accepted safety for use, even under supervision. This puts marijuana in the same category as drugs like heroin and LSD and is a gross mischaracterization of the drug.
If law enforcement equates marijuana with these drugs,  however, the general population might as well, making people more likely to try these drugs if they have already tried pot and liked it. Conversely, such a classification gives the clear impression that the DEA has no idea what its talking about, invalidating its warnings about other controlled substances.
For most of the country, marijuana’s illegal nature necessitates purchasing from dealers in criminal drug networks to obtain the drug. This can often open up channels to other illegal drugs through the dealer; such funneling can be especially problematic in communities such as college campuses, where drug experimentation is often more prevalent than at home and dozens of these connections can be found.
Legalizing marijuana is about more than just the right to enjoy a relatively harmless drug. It is about reducing the harm that can come to our society by eliminating the serious problems created by its illegal status.

No one has ever overdosed on pot. Pot has never caused someone to go home and beat their children. Pot has more medicinal benefits and qualities than most other plants. But most importantly, pot makes my 20 piece from McD’s at 3 in the morning feel and taste like a buffet for kings.
I cannot say that I would personally begin to smoke marijuana just because it is legalized. I would say however during my time here at USC that I would much rather approach a person who is stoned, than a drunk person on the row.
Many people in Arizona feel this is a FARCE. A substance such as this needs to be eliminated completely.
Here in Arizona, if you are caught using, if you have a Medical Card, or not, you will be arrested.
If you are smoking this Drug, become Drunk and hit my kid, you may not need a Lawyer.

As the July 1 ban on California’s foie gras — the Gascony-region delicacy of liver from force-fed ducks and geese — nears, some are spending their time stockpiling the expensive treat while others, notably animal rights activists, are celebrating.
But the celebration is in vain: The ban simply stands as a prime example of a hollow victory, the result of bullying and pressure from activists and politicians against a small industry that flaunts higher standards than most of America’s meat and dairy producers.
The ban, signed in 2004 but with a seven-and-half-year implementation delay, restricts the sale of any product derived from the force-feeding of birds to enlarge their livers, which is the most common way to produce foie gras. In most cases, the birds are hand-fed using a funnel system that drops around a cup of food through a long tube inserted in the bird’s throat.
The trouble lies in the fact that foie opponents view it as a cruel product, the result of abuse toward fowl. But the ban has been fueled largely by ignorance and hilariously misguided priorities more than anything else. Former state Sen. John Burton, author of the ban, appears to be a textbook sensational activist, especially in the insidious viciousness of his public lobbying.
“I’d like to sit [them] down and have duck and goose fat — better yet, dry oatmeal — shoved down their throats over and over and over again,” Burton has said of chef supporters of foie gras.
And therein lies a problem: People simply don’t seem to understand that you can’t compare birds and humans. Opponents have shown a nasty knack of anthropomorphizing ducks and geese to make the feeding process seem worse than it is. This emotional argument conveniently ignores the fact that birds don’t have the same physiology as humans, especially with their esophaguses.
In fact, the American Veterinary Medical Association House of Delegates investigated foie gras farms and practices in 2004 and 2005 and found that the conditions of the animals were better than normally found at factory farms for chickens and other livestock.  “The observations and practical experience shared by [House of Delegates] members indicate a minimum of adverse effects on the birds involved,” reads an AVMA statement.
The opposition also ignores that the vast majority of foie gras buyers are chefs, many of whom have stringent personal standards and source only humanely raised products. “A happy animal is a tasty animal,” chef, writer and TV personality Anthony Bourdain has said, noting that no self-respecting chef would buy the product of truly abused and diseased animals.
More than anything, the “victory” against foie gras shows activists’ commitment to battling a small industry that can’t afford the political and cultural advantages of massive dairy and meat corporations.
Food expert Michael Pollan says it best: “I think it’s really a way for people to feel like they’ve done something without doing anything,” he said to The New York Times. “There’s so many more serious problems we’re not dealing with.”
In the end, the issue isn’t about being able to eat a piece of duck liver — it’s about a disingenuous war waged on the right of the foie gras industry to exist, common sense and priorities be damned.

This ban on liver from force-fed animals is based on “hilariously misguided priorities?” You are not very good at writing arguments, and this article reads like a highschool debate script. If you are trying to argue for something at least try not to come across so biased and one-sided, and don’t use phraese like “hilariously misguided” because you sound like an uneducated fool. Look up “hilarious” and you’ll see how you misused it.
*phrases. Hit send too quickly. Anyway the point is you never touched on the other side’s “misguided priorities” and if they are hilarious, you failed to show it.
By your logic, Isn’t killing them and eating them inhumane then? What are we supposed to eat? Dirt. Do you think the massed produced chicken nuggets mysteriously appear out of thin air. You idiots would all starve if you had to hunt and kill food for yourselves. People are so used to nice pre-packaged meats at the store. Have you ever seen an animal butchered? Would you be able to kill an animal for food to survive?
Your ignorance is absolutely ridiculous “Huh?”.  Do you eve know the extent of how these animals are raised and how they are treated on farms?  Go out and do some research before you start stating blatant fallacies about mistreatment of animals.  
On the topic of the ban, what a shame.  I’ll have to get my fix somehow.
“Get my fix somehow”? You do that Alex! While you’re at it, why don’t you go hunting and blow the brains out of a a deer then gut it, and then just for kicks, go bludgeon a baby seal with an ice pick to it’s helpless head. Ignorance is bliss….
Laura, 
Just because a group of you think eating fatty duck livers is unacceptable, why should the rest of the population have to follow suit.  There are a lot bigger social that can be tackled than having to spend frivilous amount of of dollars on banning a food product.  After the recent “mystery meat” scare with the meat glue you don’t see the general populous outraged and banning hamburgers.  Wait, but then again you probably don’t even eat meat.  
In addition does blowing a deers brain out and bludgeoning a baby seal have to do with anything?  You my friend are IGNORANT.
So let me get this right:  You opinion is that it is okay to continue to mistreat these animals a little, because they are not mistreated as badly as others? Oh and they are tasty too.  This kind of flawed logic is so scary.

Anderson, one of two Americans in the race, just beat out Hungary’s Eva Rlsztov by 1.4 seconds for the win (1:44:30.6). Anderson needed to beat Ashley Twichell, the other American in the race, and finish in the top 10 overall to qualify for the Olympics. Twichell finished fourth with a time of 1:44:37.7.
Anderson, who won her first NCAA title in March, is a three-time conference champion. She holds USC records in the 1,000-yard freestyle, 1,650-yard freestyle, and 800-yard freestyle relay, along with a USC pool record in the 500-yard freestyle.
Anderson’s next event is the U.S. swimming indoor trials in Omaha, Neb., on June 25, where she hopes to strengthen her Olympic schedule.
So proud of you Haley!  We are all excited for you. We are sending happy thoughts and special
Wishes for great swims in your pool events at Olympic Trials! Loved trading about all your accomplishments.  Dianne

Pitchers Andrew Triggs, Martin Viramontes and Jordan Hershiser were all selected on the second day of the three-day event.
Triggs was the first to go, drafted in the 19th round (583rd overall) by the Kansas City Royals. It’s the third time the senior has been selected.
The next step · Senior starting pitcher Andrew Triggs was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in last week’s MLB draft. During his last season at USC, he had an earned run average of 3.49. - Corey Marquetti | Summer Trojan
The Cleveland Indians picked him in the 24th round in 2010, following his junior season, as did the San Francisco Giants in the 21st round of the 2011 draft. Triggs was an integral part of the weekend starting rotation all four years he played, serving as the staff’s ace his last three years. He leaves USC with a 3.74 ERA and an impressive 269 strikeouts to just 89 walks. His senior year he had career bests in ERA at 3.49, innings pitched at 105 2/3 and strikeouts with 85.
Viramontes was selected next, going in the 28th round (875th overall) to the Milwaukee Brewers. Viramontes was selected in the 27th round by the New York Yankees in 2010, but chose to transfer from Loyola Marymount to play one last season at USC. He became an integral part of the Trojan bullpen this season, posting a 3.14 ERA with five saves.
Hershiser was taken in the 34th round (1046th overall) by the Los Angeles Dodgers, the organization with which his father Orel had tremendous success. The younger Hershiser was hampered by injury for much of his Trojan career, but his athletic 6-foot-8, 245-pound build demonstrate real potential.

The men’s 4×400-meter relay placed second while the women’s 4×100-meter relay placed seventh in the final day of the NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships in Des Moines, Iowa, Saturday.
Senior Joey Hughes, senior Bryshon Nellum, junior Reggie Wyatt and sophomore Josh Mance ran the second-fastest 4×400-meter relay in USC history with a 3:00.64 finish, while Florida took the race with a 3:00.02 finish.

The Trojans needed a first-place finish in the men’s relay race to place in the top 10 among a field of more than 350 schools.
Instead, the men ended the meet in 11th place with 20 points, making it just the fifth time in the last 18 seasons that they did not finish in the top 10.
“Naturally, I’m disappointed, but we were the top finisher on the men’s side among private schools, and that is significant,” USC director of track and field Ron Allice said in a statement.
The women’s 4×100-meter relay team, composed of senior Aareon Payne, sophomores Jessica Davis and Loudia Laarman, and freshman Akawkaw Ndipagbor, placed seventh with a 44.24 time to give USC two team points.
It was the 14th time overall — and fourth time in the last seven seasons — that the women’s relay team scored at the NCAA championships.
The women’s team finished tied for 24th with 13 points.
Sophomore Aaron Brown, the lone individual male competing for the Trojans on Saturday, placed seventh in the men’s 200-meter dash from the second lane with a time of 21.13.
Brown earned his first All-America honors for his efforts and became the first Trojan male to score in the race since Ahmad Rashad placed eighth in 2007.
“Brown had a vastly improved season,” Allice said. “His performance here didn’t reflect how well he ran all season. [He ran] into a strong headwind, and his body build is not the type to be running into a strong wind.”
Junior Alitta Boyd could not advance to the finals after fouling on all three attempts of the women’s triple jump. During the preliminary rounds, Boyd set a personal record of 43-8.50 (13.2m) to move into fourth all-time on USC’s triple jump list.
Nellum’s honor comes just a few years after he was the victim of a random shooting in 2009, where he-was shot in the leg. He ran a career-best 45.18 in the open 400-meter.
Thirteen Trojans earned first-team All-America honors, including each member of the men’s and women’s relay.
Also earning top honors were Brown in the 200-meter, Wyatt in the 400-meter individual hurdles, senior Dalilah Muhammad in the 400-meter individual hurdles, senior Kristine Busa in javelin, and senior Marissa Minderler and sophomore Jenny Ozorai in hammer.
Second-team All-America honors went to Brown in the 100-meter dash, Hughes and Nellum in the 400-meter relay, freshman Alexandra Collatz in discus and freshman Daniel Szabo in hammer.
Earning honorable mention All-American honors were senior Jade Niemeyer in hammer, sophomore Lauren Blackburn in the 100-meter high hurdles, freshman Marqise Lee in long jump and freshman Davonte Stewart in the 200-meter dash.
“We have some outstanding athletes returning,” Allice said. “We want to have a very successful season in 2013 with the fact that we host the Pac-12 conference championships.”
