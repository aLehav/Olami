When you think weather in the Middle East, you think hot, dry and eternally sunny, right? Wrong.
This week, Amman has been very cold — especially by Los Angeles standards — a chilly 45 degrees most days, and with winds up to 30 miles per hour, making doing absolutely anything outside extremely unpleasant. Worse yet, this week we had sandstorms — yes, sandstorms — that combined with the wind, whipped dust in our faces and covered the sky and the sun in an eerie haze. With this bizarre combination of weather, the world outside our insulated apartment and classrooms felt vaguely post-apocalyptic, with deserted streets and boarded up windows.
On Wednesday it even snowed briefly, a cataclysmic event in this city, which made my normal 20-minute cab ride home an hour-long ordeal. This wasn’t ordinary snow, however; it was dusty snow, mixed with the dirt in the air so that when it fell, you were showered with brown, slushy snow rather than the picturesque, fluffy white snowflakes I’m used to back home in New York. It felt like being back in elementary school, watching the blizzard swirl outside and waiting anxiously until, finally, the teacher declared that we could leave early. That night we even turned out pajamas inside-out, as the tradition goes, but sadly weren’t rewarded with a snow day — though that could be a reality later this week.
Needless to say, the weather this week wasn’t ideal. But when the dust finally cleared, Amman was our beautiful city again; we finally could see the endless hills of houses, magical sunsets, and of course—the sun. Every surface outside is still covered in dust, and with water being as expensive as it is, I doubt any of these cars will be clean soon, but we can finally breathe easy outside again, just in time for another snowstorm! As of now, the weather report for Thursday, Friday and Saturday claims a snowy mix of snow, rain and sleet, which will likely make leaving our apartment impossible.
Our scheduled trip to the desert has already been cancelled, and my program sent out an extremely detailed, lengthy email on how to deal with the storm in the event we get hit with one unexpectedly. We’re advised to make sure we have plenty of food, fresh water, gas and cell phone credit before this weekend, so that if we do get a storm, we won’t be helpless, as in the past storms of this gravity have paralyzed the city for days. So only time will tell!
Hey!!!! We’re heading to Jordan this weekend as well and are reaching Amman on Saturday morning. We’re planning to take the King’s highway from Madaba to Petra on Sunday. Hopefully, we’ll be able to drive without any problems.

Yesterday, The New York Times reported that Speaker of the House John Boehner is prepared to let the Department of Homeland Security shut down. This is a shocking proclamation, especially since the GOP has consistently criticized Obama for his lack of initiative in protecting the country from terrorism, and one of their biggest mantras is that the country needs to secure borders more effectively.
Additionally, this statement directly contradicts numerous GOP election platforms promising that there would be no more shutdowns this year, in contrast to in 2013 when a Republican quibble over funding Obamacare resulted in a government shutdown and trashed the party’s public image. Boehner announcing his intentions to allow the DHS to close down at the end of the month seems nothing short of radical.
But often when a policy decision in Congress is utterly baffling, the explanation is purely political. This case is no exception. In its futile attempts to counter President Obama’s executive order on immigration, House Republicans have passed a bill that both funds DHS and guts the President’s executive order. So what does this tell us? Boehner is bluffing. This bill, which has no chances of becoming law since neither the Senate nor the President is willing to pass such immigration measures, is dead on the table unless Boehner tries to do something to put pressure on the other branches. This pressure comes in the form of Boehner is trying to hold funding hostage in order to pass immigration policy, a political mishmash that leaves the DHS in limbo.
Besides indicating that the House is veering ever more dramatically to the right and that Boehner is too blind to see his own political blunders — did he not learn from the government shutdown of 2013 that shutdowns make his party look bad? — this funding bill also sheds light on the necessity to have a germaneness rule in the Senate.
Germaneness is a stipulation that all amendments made to a bill must relate to the subject of the bill. For instance, a bill about the curriculum in public schools cannot contain an amendment about raising the gas tax under a germaneness rule. Segregating legislation into separate laws based on subject matter seems like common sense, but it Washington, the idea is nearly ludicrous. This method of adding irrelevant amendments is constantly used by both parties to sneak controversial policy into a bill guaranteed to pass due to its necessity. Unfortunately, Boehner’s immigration shenanigans would have been allowed even under this rule — the DHS does control immigration enforcement, and therefore having a bill that slashes immigration funding is germane to general DHS funding.
A germaneness rule, however, would set a precedent that these political games are ineffective means of legislating and will not be tolerated in our houses of government. If the Republicans want to pass immigration measures, pass immigration measures. But don’t dangle our nation’s security in front of us as collateral if an agreement can’t be reached.

Is this bunch of incompetents a hoot or what?  Enter the Republican circular firing squad.  Someone still could get hurt even thou they are the gang that can’t shoot straight.
DHS is a Republican conceived agency, put in place by the Bush administration in 2001. Republicans haven’t had any problems funding it before. It is only a National Security Agency. If Republicans feel that toying with Nation Security is a way of stomping their feet to get their way, it’s fine with me. Just remember, terrorists get news to. They will know when the security of the nation is vulnerable. Republicans want to cry about Obama’s immigration order, but they don’t have a plan or a bill to replace it. Now they want to kick and scream because Obama did their job. Defund DHS. It will be the first spending cut Republicans have done in decades.
This is a Regressive, Liberal Democrat Shut-down of DHS.  Should the Democraps choose to not pass the bill, the Democraps have chosen to shut down DHS.
It’s time for the regressive Democrats to step up to the plate and pass some legislation that will actually BENFIT our country.
Delusional Repuke alert. 
Clean bill? Nope can’t be bothered. Nobody is falling for your BS.
Keep up the good work though.  You scumbag liars showing your true idiot colors is leading to the long deserved extinction of your back asswards party. 
Good riddance to fetid refuse. 
I’ll take Libertarianism over Repukelican every day all day.
Thanks Tea Party for be the cement shoes the Republican party so desperately needed in the sea of politics.

Found in the heart of Chinatown, this small, yet bright restaurant made for a perfect pre-Valentine’s Friday night dinner. If you are looking to stuff yourself with traditional Chinese food, Yang Chow is definitely your place.
Don’t expect too much in terms of appearance. The fact that they don’t focus as much on their physical aspect is a plus, for what they lack in aesthetics, they make up for in taste and service.
When we arrived, we sat at a traditional family-style table with a lazy Susan in the middle. The awesome Asian guy who served us kept making jokes about the food — even when I spilled all the water and caused a huge scene in his rather orderly restaurant. Everyone was attentive, constantly filling up our water glasses and making sure we weren’t missing anything.
The main reason we ended up in this restaurant was because we were craving Peking duck. Not even listed on their menu, the duck they serve at Yang Chow is definitely a hidden gem. Other versions of Peking duck are characterized for being cut in large, chunky pieces that take away from enjoying the crispy skin, but Yang Chow’s Peking duck was sliced in wide strips that were perfectly removed from the breasts of the duck. Amazingly dexterous with three spoons in his hands, the server prepared our Peking duck tacos for us. He placed a small amount of sauce, some sliced scallion whites and a couple of slices of the duck’s skin and breast. He was so meticulous in wrapping the tacos that for once in my life I didn’t destroy the whole thing as I was putting it into my mouth.
The meat of the duck immediately melted in our mouths in a pool of sweet duck fat. The honey that it was dipped in before being cooked was so well absorbed into the skin that is allowed for succulent and juicy meat.
The duck is definitely one to order if you ever have a chance to visit Yang Chow. We also ordered spring rolls, but were a little disappointed by those. They were small, in fact, so small that most of what you could feel on them was oily fat, and the vegetables inside were hardly noticeable. The trick with spring rolls is making them large enough so that you can taste the vegetables with a hint of grease, not the other way around.
On the other hand, the rest of the dishes that we ordered were not only classical, but also excellent. The beef lomain, although topped with only a few pieces of meat, was the ideal blend between greasy and tasty. The additional chestnuts gave the soft and warm noodles a crunchy feel, creating a flawless contrast. The mixed rice is a staple, with a good balance between the scrambled eggs, meat and rice.
With four stars for taste, and both a Zagat and a Trip Advisor price, you definitely get what you pay for at Yang Chow.

We’re five weeks deep into the spring semester, and hopes and expectations are soaring. From the highly celebrated football games to the rowdy registers thrown from last fall, Spring 2015 has a lot to live up to. Spring semester, however, is usually one that is a bit less wild. There are no longer weekly football tailgates, and the bands music can no longer be heard throughout campus. For students who have experienced fall semester, they know how much this university has to offer its students.
There are, however, also new students every spring. Spring admits sometimes have a hard time saying that USC is all they dreamed of, just because meeting friends and getting involved isn’t as easy when most have already gone through that process four months ago.
For guys who are spring admits, spring rush is offered for fraternities. Yet the women have to wait until next fall to participate in formal recruitment. With all the restrictions put on the spring admits, it can be hard to find a place to call their own at school.
For those new to USC, the best way to make the most of this semester is to participate in the involvement fairs, attend parties with people you meet in class and actively seek out what it is you wish to accomplish while at school.
There are many people at USC who are constantly looking for new friends and seeking out new fun places to visit in Los Angeles. Even though spring semester feels like the student body is less unified, there are still a few annual events that take place.
First comes Cabo San Lucas, a.k.a. the Super Bowl of spring Break. If you are lucky enough to take this fun-filled vacation, it is an excellent opportunity to bond with your fellow classmates while getting a sun-kissed tan and sipping piña coladas. The semester also presents Spring Fest. Past performers include Tyga, Big Sean and Macklemore, so mark your calendars for April 4 if you wish to attend.
How great of a spring semester you experience depends how much you put into it. So try your best to make the most of it, and get excited!

Welcome to the humdrum period of professional hockey. It’s February, which means we have watched enough hockey to know which teams are for real, but there is also enough time for teams at the top to slip up and for dark horse teams to gain some momentum and possibly sneak into the playoffs.
Meanwhile, we are stuck in limbo. Only time will tell who will emerge as contenders and who will slip through the cracks. With so many storylines yet to unfold, all we can do is simply sit back and wait.
Wait, what’s that? The New York Islanders are leading the Metropolitan Division? The Nashville Predators are sitting atop the Central Division? Tampa Bay has 34 wins in mid-February? When did this happen? How? What? No.
Yes.
Behold the new-look National Hockey League. Sure, Buffalo is still dismal and Edmonton still can’t buy a win, but just look at the rest of the league. There is plenty of hockey still to be played, but the New York Islanders and the Tampa Bay Lightning are both top three teams in the Eastern Conference, while the Nashville Predators have established themselves as the number one team in the Western Conference.
While you were taking your annual NHL siesta, the Islanders emerged as an elite team, piling up 75 points thus far and sporting a 20-6-0 home record. With a goal differential of plus-23, this team is proving that it is more than just the John Tavares show. Offseason acquisitions Johnny Boychuk and Nick Leddy have been sound defensemen for the Isles this season, while veteran netminder Jaroslav Halak has recorded a 30-11 record on the season and has logged a .912 save percentage in the process.
The Lightning also know a thing or two about solid goaltending. Ben Bishop has been outstanding between the pipes this season. Bishop is in great form, as he is allowing below 2.5 goals per game. He has shown consistency in his time with the Lightning, averaging a .917 save percentage since joining Tampa Bay in 2012. The Lightning also have one of the most potent attacks in hockey right now, with a killer one-two punch of sniper Steven Stamkos on the top line and assist machine Ondrej Palat on the second line. Tampa Bay’s plus-30 goal differential can obviously be largely attributed to Stamkos, who is lighting in a bottle (pun intended) and can seemingly score on demand. But the supporting cast has stepped up in a major way. Ryan Callahan, who was Martin St. Louis’s counterpart in last season’s trade with the New York Rangers, has 39 points and is looking more and more comfortable with Stamkos on the first line.
The Islanders made the playoffs in the 2012-13 season, giving the Pittsburgh Penguins a run for their money in the first round before losing in six games. The Lightning were swept by the Montreal Canadiens in last season’s playoffs, but they were expected to make a run at the postseason again this year, so Jon Cooper’s squad was certainly not a “sleeper” heading into this season.
The Nashville Predators are a different story, though, especially because of how competitive their division happens to be. With all due respect to the Eastern Conference, the West is brutal in comparison — at least on paper. Of the 14 teams in the Western Conference, only three have fewer than 60 points thus far. In the East, however, half of the teams have not reached 60 points yet. Though this is obviously not the sole comparative metric between conferences, it is important to note that teams in the West really are looking at what may be a photo finish to get into the playoffs. The disparity between teams in the East’s Metropolitan Division, for example, is clear. The drop-off is evident. Washington, fourth in the division, is sitting on 68 points, while Philadelphia, fifth, has just 56. In comparison to the West’s Central Division, which is an absolute bloodbath, this gap is extraordinary.
The parity in the West makes for great entertainment, but for fans of the Nashville Predators, this drama may not be relevant to them this season if the team keeps chugging along as it is right now. Head coach Peter Laviolette has helped his team to an impressive 38 wins thus far. The Preds also boast a plus-39 goal differential, second only to St. Louis and Chicago, who both have a plus-40 mark. The Blues and the Blackhawks are outstanding yet again this season, which makes Nashville’s rise to the top of the Central Division even more remarkable. The Preds look built for the postseason, especially with Shea Weber anchoring the defense and Pekka Rinne in goal.
We shall see what unfolds the rest of the way, but when the playoffs roll around, don’t be surprised to see the Islanders, Lightning and Predators all contending. These teams have flipped the script and taken the league by storm. The Blackhawks will be in the mix, as will the Blues, Ducks, Canadiens and many of the other usual suspects. But don’t forget about the new kids on the block. Because they can skate with the best of them.
