While the recent resurgence of Afro-pop-punk is nice (Johnny Clegg is finally cool!), Vampire Weekend and the like can often feel pretty feckless. There’s nothing wrong with that, but well, sometimes rock needs a little feck.
Enter Wolf Parade.
The group’s new album Expo 86 has moxie to spare. Bedroom kids will be burning out nightlights and callusing their fingers to the new release in no time at all, pressing its chords into their brains and muscle memory.
The Montreal-based foursome isn’t reinventing the wheel, but they’re certainly kicking it down the hill with a fair amount of force. All starry-eyed sonic youngsters are just products of the young before them, including those individuals we’ve rightfully christened as gods. Thievery makes for good music, after all, and although not quite in the same echelon as your Zeppelins or your Husker Dus, Wolf Parade is adept enough at emulating the noisemakers they love to warrant any and all attention it receives.
Wolf Parade’s debut, Apologies to the Queen Marie, was pointed, noisy and meaty enough to kink a neck in all the right places. The follow-up, At Mount Zoomer, seemingly separating the disparate personalities of its principal songwriters Spencer Krug and Dan Boeckner, was less focused but still potent. Things get tight again on Expo 86.
For the first few tracks, however, that tightness is not immediately apparent. The first song, “Cloud Shadow On The Mountain,” is an unmistakably Krug-penned epic, and the second, “Palm Road,” is undoubtedly a Boeckner rocker. Upon first listen the major problem with the band’s second album — the evident Krug or Boeckner trade-off from song to song — has returned. Why is this such a problem?
Krug and Boeckner are shockingly prolific creators, and both have — or have had — very successful solo and side projects. Krug is a former member of Fifths of Seven and Frog Eyes, a current member of Swan Lake (with Frog Eyes’ Carey Mercer) and Sunset Rubdown, and the sole member of his Moonface project. Boeckner, a former member of Atlas Strategic — which was almost signed to Sub Pop, Wolf Parade’s current label — is the lead singer and guitarist of the Handsome Furs, an excellent synth-punk duo also signed to Sub Pop. There is no shortage of material that showcases the talent and style of Wolf Parade’s two-man nucleus. The other side of that awesomely prolific coin is that it will become very clear very fast if Wolf Parade becomes an arena for the two to pitch their solo ideas.
This is the fear heading into the third track on Expo 86, but in what can only be described as a modern miracle of synergy, “What Did My Lover Say? (It Always Had To Go This Way)” gels. And it’s fantastic. It truly sounds like an amalgamation of the long list of Wolf Parade-associated works. Yeah, it’s a Krug-track with very Krug-vocals and with withdrawn, but still evident Krug-esque lyrics. But Boeckner brings in a very Boeckner-y riff, and about halfway through the song, listeners will stop caring which of the two was calling the shots. For the first time since the group’s debut, a Wolf Parade song can be described without bending members’ names into adjectives. This song just rocks.
Credit is due, in no small part, to multi-instrumentalist Dante DeCaro and drummer Arlen Thompson for filling in for everything that Krug and Boeckner choose not to do.
While there’s too much going on here to nitpick any of DeCaro’s contributions, Thompson does leave something to be desired. He feels very restrained here, and unlike his work with Arcade Fire, the drums don’t greatly augment the experience. Thompson is capable of much more and certainly he’ll bring heavier sticks and a little swagger to these songs on the road. Get excited to burst some eardrums to the sound of “Ghost Pressure.”
They’re not rock gods (yet), but these four music geeks swinging their instruments around have managed to make good ol’ fashioned garage-born racket, with ace production to boot. Expo 86 is a crowning example of rock done best by those who do rock best, nerds! If they keep it up, they’ll be donning dorm walls in no less than 20 years, and the resident cool kid will be saying, “They don’t make them like they used to.”
You’re probably right, cool kid. But they do come awfully close.

If you have to be pegged as something in show business, it might as well be as the fun drunk.
Comedian-turned-television-personality-turned-author Zane Lamprey finds himself occupying that very niche at the present moment, but he’s far from broken up about it.
Dionysian revelry · Lamprey is first and foremost a comedian. - Photo courtesy of Karen Marines 
“I’m just happy to be contacted, you know what I mean?” said Lamprey, host of Travel Channel fan favorite Three Sheets. “There’s so much competition in L.A. that I think it’s ultimately an actor’s dream to be pigeonholed into something.”
Although Lamprey officially studied theater in college, his current gigs are more dependent on his knowledge of  something he probably majored in unofficially in his time at SUNY Cortland: drinking. The mantle of resident alcohol expert was thrust upon him by fate, which happened to take the form of an offer from the network MOJO HD, but Lamprey said he would have just as willingly taken a job with another angle.
“Being pigeonholed into something is better than not getting the work,” he said.
All the same, the fact remains that Lamprey’s celebrity is, for the most part, built up around the fun-yet-knowledgeable drinking buddy persona he cultivated in his wanderlust-style travel series Three Sheets. But Lamprey doesn’t see his notoriety as ‘the TV drinking guy’ as particularly limiting.
“As long as I can continue to grow, then I’m happy,” he said.
Already Lamprey has expanded his drinking shtick to encompass multiple markets. He proved himself as a hearty-livered globetrotter in his wildly popular travelogue Three Sheets — the series has changed hands a few times since premiering on MOJO HD, having appeared at different points on the Fine Living Network and the Travel Channel — and recently authored his first book, Three Sheets: Drinking Made Easy!, and embarked on his first standup comedy tour since the show took over his career. He is also working on an album of drinking songs, at once an absurdity and the next logical step.
“It might all seem like they’re not related, or that I’m just trying to capitalize on what I’m doing, but these are all things that I’ve been doing forever,” Lamprey said. “Now I’m just doing them around the vein of drinking, because it’s sort of what I’m best known for.”
Given the nature of his show and the fact that he’s never without his production  team and camera crew while traveling abroad, Lamprey acknowledges that his experience of a country is by no means the final word in a consideration of its national drinking habits.
“We’re a melting pot in so many ways, alcohol is really no different.” Lamprey said. “There are some that revere it, there is some that don’t care for it, there is some that overindulge and there’s some that take it in moderation … It’d be tough to categorize that. I think even in the other countries that I’ve gone, it’s difficult to meet three people and then say from that ‘This is the way people drink.’”
In the midst of his nationwide tour, filming episodes of his new series Drinking Made Easy for HDNet during the day and doing standup at night — Lamprey will be hitting Los Angeles on July 16 — the man who is regularly told that he has the best job in the world does indeed seem to have plenty to be thankful for.
Who wouldn’t drink to that?

The Lakers T-shirt was just icing on the cake: The audience that had gathered to witness the Los Angeles premiere of the Tony Award-winning musical In The Heights had been won over long before the show’s creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda reappeared from backstage for a curtain call in a garment bearing the insignia of the Los Angeles Lakers.
Streetlight · Lin-Manuel Miranda returns to the role of Usnavi in the touring production of In The Heights, now at the Pantages Theatre. - Photo courtesy of Broadway/LA 
His impeccable taste in post-performance attire notwithstanding, Miranda’s Los Angeles reception has been nothing short of a hero’s welcome. Celebrities including Wayne Brady, Wilmer Valderrama and Jai Rodriguez turned out to celebrate the show’s official Los Angeles opening Wednesday night, and — whether wisely or not — Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa risked further scrutiny by also attending the opening.
After the cast had taken its final bow, Villaraigosa emerged from the wings to present the cast with a framed city proclamation on behalf of all those who would be introduced to Miranda’s socially significant story for the first time by way of the production’s monthlong residency in Los Angeles. (Villaraigosa, who is presently the subject of intense media attention for his alleged acceptance of free tickets to concerts, award shows, sporting and cultural events, was quick to also give his appreciation for the revenue the show’s five-week run is expected to generate.)
Whether it’s found in Washington Heights or Boyle Heights, Villaraigosa remarked onstage, the immigrant experience is universal and worth documenting.
Miranda clearly agrees. He cites his first time seeing a performance of Rent as the moment he realized that theater could be used to document a whole range of experiences, not just the classic stories that have already been immortalized in the Rodgers & Hammerstein canon.
In The Heights centers on the lives of residents of a Latino community in Upper Manhattan called Washington Heights at a crucial time in the neighborhood’s existence, and Usnavi (Miranda) and his high-traffic bodega are situated right in the thick of it. From his enviable corner location — neighborhood gossip Daniela (Isabel Santiago), owner of the next-door salon, would kill to hear half of what he does — Usnavi is all too aware that no one in the hard-scrabble neighborhood is free from money troubles. The sensual Vanessa (Sabrina Sloan) yearns to pick up and leave in favor of an apartment Downtown, but with her mother drinking away the rent, she can’t even afford to live in Washington Heights; Kevin and Camila Rosario (Danny Bolero and Natalie Toro) struggle to finance their daughter Nina’s (Arielle Jacobs) Stanford education with their flailing taxi dispatch service;  and with more and more people turning to Mr. Softee instead of shaved ice vendors, even the Piragua Guy (David Baida) is feeling the pinch.
Word spreads quickly that Nina, youthful prodigy and the pride of the neighborhood, is back from college, but her unexpected news sends the community into a tailspin. A similarly unexpected windfall seems to be just the thing to stave off the urban decay that’s been eating away at the aging barrio, but Abuela Claudia (Elise Santora) appears to have other plans for the money, namely helping Usnavi reconnect with his Dominican heritage and return to the Caribbean island his parents called home.
In The Heights’ current engagement at Hollywood’s Pantages Theatre represents only the latest chapter in the show’s history in the decade since it formally came into existence in April 2000, as a one-act student production at Miranda’s alma mater, Wesleyan University in Connecticut. Eight years, seven distinct incarnations and countless wholesale revisions later, Miranda’s much-workshopped brainchild was honored with three Tonys in 2008, including the top prize for best musical. Andy Blankenbuehler’s choreography and Miranda’s music and lyrics were also recognized with wins in their respective categories.
The touring production that’s set up shop on the Pantages stage features precious few members of the original Broadway cast, with one important exception: Lin-Manuel Miranda is returning as Usnavi for the first time since handing off the leading role to Javier Muñoz in February 2009.
As Abuela Claudia, Elise Santora lacks the comedic timing of  Olga Merediz, who played the role on Broadway, but Santora’s incredible pipes bring a power to the numbers showcasing Abuela Claudia that is notably absent on the original Broadway cast recording. But it’s Arielle Jacobs as Nina who all but steals the show. She defines her character in terms of the staggering weight she must bear, having been saddled with the hopes of the entire neighborhood since childhood. And again, Jacobs’ vocal performance far outstrips her equivalent on the soundtrack.
Jacobs’ previous credits include originating the starring role of Gabriella in the world tour of Disney’s High School Musical. Curiously enough, this is only one of many points of intersection between In The Heights and High School Musical: Corbin Bleu is starring as Usnavi   in the current Broadway cast, and High School Musical director Kenny Ortega is slated to direct the upcoming film adaptation of the enormously successful musical.
Even discounting slight tweaks to the material for relevance — a rapped protest by Usnavi’s cousin Sonny (Shaun Taylor-Corbett) in the song “96,000” has been updated to include the line “Arizona be hatin’” — Miranda’s music still resonates with audiences just as  much as it did when it opened in New York two years ago, and probably just as much as it did when he premiered it at Wesleyan in his college days.
The show’s poignancy lies in its ability to touch on broad themes like gentrification and urban decay in ways that are sufficiently nonspecific (In five years when this whole city’s rich folks and hipsters / Who’s gonna miss this raggedy little business?) so as to not alienate audiences not necessarily familiar with the actual setting. This is a far cry from decidedly less inclusive work like A Chorus Line, where insider-only references regularly serve as the punch lines to inside jokes to which only New Yorkers are privy.
For all the talk of the changes that have been ushered in by this landmark production, In The Heights is, at its heart, a classic Broadway musical.
Hip-hop score and spicy dance numbers aside, In The Heights offers a beautiful story of finding your place in the world. What’s more Broadway that that?

USC’s School of Social Work will begin maintaining an archive of exemplary student papers and research through a new partnership between the City University of Hong Kong and USC Libraries. The partnership is CityU’s first with a North American university.
The schools hope the Outstanding Academic Papers by Students collection, will help preserve outstanding work by students, and give others permanent access to past work.
CityU first introduced the project in 2004 as a means to help students learn efficient research and writing skills and instill a sense of academic integrity.
“We’re proud to be a part of this wonderful project that raises the visibility of the quality work our students produce and provides long-term access to their research,” Cherry Short told USC News. Short is the assistant dean of global community initiatives for the School of Social Work.
A committee of USC faculty members reviewed and submitted 10 papers authored by students in the social work graduate program. The review committee based their selections on the quality of research, writing, presentation and creativity.
The collection of papers is published in a book and is also being preserved in USC’s digital library, where international researchers and students can access the selected works.
As a reward for having their work chosen by the review committee, students received a certificate and copy of the published book at the Dean’s Recognition Ceremony on May 7.
Erin Dowler, who wrote a paper evaluating a client support service within the Immigrants’ Rights Project at Public Counsel, was one of those recognized at the ceremony.
“This project has made a very positive impact on my education seeing how my research paper has translated into useful knowledge, which can help others in my field in the U.S. and internationally,” she told USC News.
Administrators for USC Libraries plan on branching out with the program and asking other schools on campus to create the same type of archive where exemplary work can serve as an additional resource for students.

As hundreds of newly admitted students for the freshman class of 2014 flood USC this week for one of several orientations held throughout the summer, they won’t be bringing their brand new USCards to a big white tent.
Working on it · Construction still cases the campus center and much of Trousdale Parkway, though the campus center has seen a fair bit of traffic since it opened its doors in June. Many prospective students availed themselves of the two available restaurants in the food court this week, as another orientation session brought many admitted students to campus. - Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Troja
Ronald Tutor Campus Center opened two of its restaurants this week for business — Wahoo’s Fish Taco, moving from its previous location at Café 84, and Carl’s Jr., which operated out of The Lot up until the tent’s closure last month. Also slated to open its counters later this week is Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.
The rest of the nine restaurants and cafes that will be operating out of the campus center will also open for business in the next two months, with training periods for its staff beginning up to two weeks before.
California Pizza Kitchen, Panda Express and Seeds Marketplace will begin accepting student business in July; August will bring newcomers Lemonade and Moreton Fig officially to campus, as well as reintroduce USC’s 23-year-old bar, Traditions, into the student perview.
Though construction still lines Trousdale Parkway, Trojan Hospitality began the process of moving student organizations and commercial outlets June 1. The campus center will also house the offices of the Alumni Center, Graduate and Professional Student Senate, the SCheduling Office, Admission Center, Undergraduate Student Government, KSCR radio station and Program Board, among others.
No Indian (East-Indian) food joints? I remember reading some USC department’s annual report that says that there are ~1500 Indian students in the campus…….add to this those localites whod like to have indian food
So the lot is closed and the campus center is (supposedly) open, but only from 7-3 M-F? Is there any way to get in outside of those hours? All the entrances are sitll blocked off

If legislators get their wish, the latest attempt to make a dent in California’s staggering $19.1-billion deficit might be coming to a traffic jam near you in the Golden State, and it might be in the form of a foot-long flashing McDonald’s sign.
Lucy Mueller | Summer Trojan
Californian lawmakers are launching a study to test the feasibility of converting license plates into digital advertisements, essentially small-scale versions of the many electronic billboards scattered around Los Angeles.
Proponents of the digital switch tout the millions of dollars in advertising revenue the new plates would bring in, along with other possible benefits that could be tacked on later, including easier automobile registration features and a system that  would immediately alert drivers of hazardous conditions.
If this seems a little like reinventing the steering wheel, perhaps it’s because it is. The general infeasibility of the plan and the detriments far outweigh the much-lauded accoutrements.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has already promised to veto  any legislation that comes to his desk regarding the ambitious digital doohickeys.
“The legislature needs to focus on passing a budget that lives within our means instead of distracting drivers to raise revenues,” his office said in a statement it released Tuesday.
The governator’s office astutely points out one of the many flaws of the plan — its potential to distract drivers. Many L.A. motorists are negligent enough, be it from illegally talking on their cellphones (ahem, Maria Shriver) or squinting their eyes to read the novelty bumpersticker on the car in front of them. (My Kid Beat Up Your Honor Student.)
Add in a talking Geico, and road rage might replace distraction as the bigger roadblock.
While the advertisements are playing, (only after the car has been stopped for four seconds, according to the plan’s lobbyists), the license numbers will be relegated to miniscule type on the corner of the plate.
The plan raises more incredulity than it assuages. For the ads to play perfectly on cars across the state, California would have to implement a state-wide wireless system — a requirement that leaves the proposal open to technical glitches.
Indignant bloggers have proposed that California’s wi-fi could be the victim of rolling blackouts, wiping the license numbers from every car on the road, or worse, that the system could be hacked by adventurous Internet pirates intent on broadcast obscene images.
Wild schemes about traveling pornography aside, the proposed change’s biggest problem is not its vulnerability to snafu or trickery — it’s the fact that legislators want to foist off California’s budget woes on constituents who might not want to be speeding Don Draper pawns. This is a ludicrous fix for a problem that demands and deserves hard thought.
California’s deficit won’t be solved by applying a goofy Band-Aid to a bullet wound, and the sooner lawmakers realize that, the sooner they can go to work solving the problem with realistic approaches.
So hats off to Schwarzenegger for recognizing a lame duck when he sees one.
And to you, lawmakers, I say this: Californians don’t want to be just another cog in the wheel.

In a town where misguided terms like celebrity and fame get thrown around about as often as a new stadium proposal is sent to the NFL, it’s not surprising that Los Angeles’ most successful living sports figure has been largely overlooked by a society more enthralled with activity than achievement.
Yet, if you were to ask Jerry Buss, that’s probably the way he prefers it.
Regardless of the USC alum’s contentment with living in relative obscurity, free from the praise and adoration bestowed upon his employees and renowned investment these past 31 years, it’s time we tip our caps, raise our glasses and applaud until our hands go numb, because — let’s face it — he is more than overdue for a good old-fashioned Hollywood spotlight.
In this 21st century world of sports, owners are no longer just wealthy, well-dressed, aging men looking to frivolously spend a few bucks for mere entertainment.
No, today’s breed of owners are convinced they are the entertainment.
Somewhere in the industry’s modern-day about-face, these dot-com billionaires, affluent bankers and real estate moguls have fled from behind the glass of their cozy luxury suites and into the front rows of an arena near you.
While for any franchise it’s important to have a face, an identity for the people to relate to, that representation should not be of a grown man flicking off fans or waving a foam finger or cursing out referees after a blown call.
For as long as I can remember there has been an established order in the world of sports: Players play, coaches coach, fans cheer and owners watch from afar as their investment grows. Sadly, that appears to be nothing more than a fleeting image these days.
However, just as I was about to say my final goodbyes and bury this now-indistinguishable concept, I found myself mesmerized by Buss, who just moments after the Lakers captured their 16th title in franchise history, took the time to remind me that some owners still value the age-old notion that whole is still greater than the sum of its parts.
When Buss first arrived in Los Angeles back in 1953, there were no dreams of ticker tape parades, no lofty goals of championship rings, no aspirations of overseeing one of the most powerful sports brands in the world. In fact, sports did not bring him to this place that would one day play host to his life’s masterpiece —education did.
Buss’s path to the pinnacle of the industry began with a master’s and doctorate from USC in, of all things, physical chemistry.
While he would ultimately make his life’s fortune in the housing market rather than a field that aptly suited his post-graduate degrees, his lasting impact on this city and its sports scene was ultimately the by-product of his uncanny ability to instill one central ingredient into the business of running a franchise: chemistry.
On paper, a chemistry major turned real estate entrepreneur looked like a bad match for an organization in need of an owner who could handle the pressure of pleasing championship-crazed fans in a town where success and pizzazz are yearly expectations, not over-sized dreams. But since his landmark purchase of the Lakers, Kings and the arena in which they would play in 1979 ($67.5 million was the largest sports transaction in history at the time), all Buss has done is put the title back in title-holder.
From drafting Ervin “Magic” Johnson, to hiring coaching icons Pat Riley and Phil Jackson, to reinvigorating the nightly fan experience with cheerleaders and A-list celebrities, to moving the team to a brand new, state-of-the-art arena in the heart of Downtown, every choice made during his 31 years of ownership has been a testament to his willingness to do what it takes to create an atmosphere conducive to organizational excellence — both in terms of banners hanging in the rafters and in the minds of those who walk through the turnstiles from October to June.
What makes the 76-year-old owner so rare, though, is not the statistics his franchise has accumulated in 31 years. Sure, it’s easy to get lost in the 10 NBA titles, the 16 Western Conference championships, the 29 playoff appearances and the astonishing amount of enshrinement ceremonies held for his former employees in Springfield, Mass., over the years.
These numbers never get old reciting if you bleed purple and gold, but it’s been done before in other sports, just ask George Steinbrenner.
But where Steinbrenner’s passion for winning at all costs has largely been criticized over the years as a detriment to the game, for Buss, the anti-Machiavellian figure, the thrill is as much about the means as it is the ends.
Although intermolecular forces and reaction kinetics have no place in a world dominated by eight-figure salaries and ego-filled athletes, the central principle remains the same: combining mixed parts to find the ideal formula. And in that regard, the chemist in Buss makes for the perfect owner — a man willing to defer responsibility and authority if it’s in the best interest of all involved.
His name may be attached to the deed of the franchise, but Buss recognizes that money has afforded him a privilege, not a right. It is a privilege that allows him the opportunity to share the blessing and the burden of overseeing a professional sports franchise with the thousands of names and faces unrecognizable to even the most die-hard of enthusiasts.
We tend to view sports on the surface, and in that sense, Buss’ finest leadership qualities go unnoticed. While it is easier to associate the Lakers with the high-arching hook of Kareem, the majestic no-look passes of Magic and the once-in-a-generation shot making abilities of Kobe, neglecting to value the significance of Buss’ imprint on the franchise’s historic rise to worldwide acclaim during the past three decades sends a chilling message — one that further promotes the declining values that have slowly permeated one of the most sought-after positions in the industry.
It is an industry wrought with divorce proceedings, YouTube drunken follies and men who view stature and title as an excuse to choose self-promotion over organizational preservation.
However, before you, too, say your final farewells to the games as you knew them, look no further than the astonishing journey that Buss took — and it all began at the gates of USC. It is a timeless success story that illustrates even in sports there is hope, that the mundanity of excellence and character can still prevail over the shock-and- awe value of scandal.
And this August, the former Trojan will make his way to another Hall of Fame ceremony in Springfield. Only this time, it will finally be a ceremony in his honor.
Odds are, during this moment of celebration, Buss will be quick to thank others, smile politely and then continue to walk off the stage back behind the anonymity on the other side of the glass — a fitting exit for man who hasn’t let fame and celebrity steer him away from upholding the integrity of the job.

After absorbing a harsh blow by the NCAA, USC has decided to fight back.
The university will appeal the several sanctions — a two-year bowl ban and a loss of 30 scholarships from 2011-2013 — deemed “too severe” and “inconsistent with precedent.”
“We disagree with many of the findings in the report from the NCAA Committee on Infractions and assert that the penalties imposed are too severe for the violations identified and are inconsistent with precedent in similar cases,” said Todd Dickey, USC’s senior vice president for administration, in a statement released  Friday.
Not in control · First-year coach Lane Kiffin and the Trojans hope the school’s appeal will allow them to compete in a bowl game in 2011-2012. - Geo Tu | Summer Trojan 
In the release, USC announced it will ask for the two-year bowl ban to be reduced to one year.  The university also seeks a reduction in scholarship penalties for the football program — instead of losing 10 scholarships each year from 2011-2013, the Trojans are asking it be reduced to five each year.
The NCAA infractions committee plans to meet in late September and early November, but, with the time frame given, USC decided to accept the bowl ban for the upcoming season and hope the NCAA will leave it at that.
A four-year investigation of the university’s athletic program resulted in a 67-page report that penalized USC for a lack of institutional control.
Two of the primary culprits listed in the report included former football Heisman Trophy winner Reggie Bush and basketball one-and-done prep star O.J. Mayo.
The football team was not the only subject of controversy for the university.  The men’s basketball team and women’s tennis team were also cited in the report, but the NCAA did not take any further action against the basketball team.
Earlier this year, the university self-imposed sanctions on the basketball team, banning it from postseason play for the 2009-2010 season, forfeiting all victories in the only season Mayo was eligible and reducing the amount of scholarships the program is allowed to use for the next two years.
Bush received lavish gifts from two would-be sports marketers — Lloyd Lake and Michael Michaels — and his family also accepted payments for hotel stays and a rent-free home in San Diego.
“The university recognizes that violations of NCAA rules did occur, especially involving impermissible benefits going to student athletes as well as their friends and families, from unscrupulous sports agents and sports marketers,” Dickey said. “We take full responsibility for those violations, given that they happened on our watch.”
The NCAA declared Bush was ineligible to play beginning in December 2004 and, in turn, USC was ordered to forfeit every victory in which Bush participated while ineligible.
Bush’s Heisman Trophy could be revoked as well.  Members of the Heisman Trust said they might review Bush’s award if the NCAA deemed him ineligible.
Bush has acknowledged no wrongdoing and vowed to help USC fight the sanctions.
“I’m going to do everything I can to make this right, some way, somehow, some shape or form, if it’s the last thing I do,” he said.
The appeals process will take at least several months, and many experts believe an answer in the spring would be the best-case scenario for the university.
In that situation, an NCAA overturning of the original ruling and upholding the terms of USC’s appeal would put the school in immediate position to compete in a bowl game — and halve the number of scholarships lost.
USC has already begun to find recruits to enroll in January to help  bypass the NCAA’s mandated scholarship limits that kick in next fall.
