Adjectives were thrown around like it was Christmas in the USC locker room after the game Saturday.
Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
It seems no one could find the right words to describe the 21-17 loss the No. 20 Trojans suffered at the hands of Arizona.
Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley had to paused for a while before reaching a conclusion.
“I’m trying to think,” a not-so-visibly-displeased Barkley said. “I’d say unbelievable. I’d say amazing, crazy.”
Hmm.
Sixth-year senior offensive guard Jeff Byers, a captain in his final home game as a Trojan, shared a different opinion.
“It is what it is,” Byers said. “It’s frustrating and it’s hard, but dwelling on it is not gonna help me, not gonna help anybody else.”
“It’s part of life.”
Ask Arizona quarterback Nick Foles, who led his team to a final-drive victory in the last three minutes, and you get a bit of a different opinion.
“It comes down to will and wanting it,” Foles said. “And our guys have a lot of heart. USC played great, but our guys wanted it more.”
I’d agree, Mr. Foles.
But I heard a lot of different reasons — a lot of buts, some more valid than others— from the USC side.
“To not be able to win our games at the Coliseum is a big disappointment,” head coach Pete Carroll said. “But it’s young program and there is a tremendous feeling about the guys coming up.”
Fourth-year junior receiver Damian Williams limped to his locker, nursing a still-sore ankle injury. He looked beyond disappointed, if that’s possible.
“It’s tough to swallow,” said Williams, who was reported by multiple sources to be yelling at his teammates in the second half, saying they were getting their butts kicked. “But at the same time, that’s what you go to practice for every day.”
Senior safety Will Harris brought up the uncanny amount of injuries that affected USC.
“It was just a frustrating year,” Harris said. “Two guys going down with neck injuries, Stafon with the throat, and it was just a very emotional and frustrating year for us. But we did the best we can.
Fourth-year junior running back Allen Bradford blamed the time of the game.
“I’m not sure what it was,” Bradford said. “Probably just waking up early, being used to night games, I don’t know what it was.”
Well, whatever it was, it surely wasn’t what they expected.
Four losses in one year for a team that lost once last season and considered it a disappointment.
Four losses in one year for a team that has been to the Rose Bowl the last four years.
Four losses in one year for a team that has been used to being at the top of the conference.
“It feels so different,” Carroll said. “It is so different from where we have been and what we have done.”
This year will be memorable, without a doubt. But for the wrong reasons.
“I’ve never been a part of this,” Harris said. “Every year I’ve been going to the Rose Bowl so it’s gonna feel a little weird.”
But the excuses — the excuses, we could do without.
“I think it’s funny that we call this a low,” Byers said. “An 8-4 season is pretty darn good by most people’s standards.”
And maybe USC will grow from this, maybe USC will bounce back next year. But for now, what USC’s 8-4 season comes down to — in all likelihood — is a December 23 date at the Poinsettia Bowl with Utah of the Mountain West Conference.
The 2009 Trojans’ last chance to prove themselves, they say.
“Orange Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Vegas Bowl, who cares?” Byers said. “Wherever it is, let’s go and let’s have fun. We’ve got one more shot at this thing to prove who we are to go out and show the world what we are and what we’re all about. That’s what we’re going to do and that’s the only thing we can do.”
It’s a lot of things, but discipline very much plays into it and the overriding devotion to Barkley. Two things about the season stick out in my mind very much. The celebration of the guy who made the tackle on the penultimate play in the Washington game…just before they lost on that short FG. The 2nd being Barkley’s comment about “not learning anything from the humiliating beating at Oregon”, wow. I still can’t believe he said that. Carroll needed to be a coach more this season, and less a “good buddy” to this team. A lack of defensive skill in the secondary, just ate them up from the ND game onward, they were badly exposed and outplayed. The play at mlb wasn’t there either. PC can admit the failings or just gloss over it with the “good buddy” stuff and rah rah. If he does they’ll lose 3 or 4 more again next year. 8-4 still isn’t bad, it’s just mediocre and playing in the Emerald Nut bowl is their reward. Take your long johns. I went to the inaugural game, and even the AF Falcon didn’t want to fly that night…….cheers.
Bradford blames the kickoff time?  Really?  Seriously AB, it shouldn’t matter if the game starts at 12:30 or 7:30, you have to be up and ready to play, champions play with that fire every week and obviously this was not a championship team.  Perhaps the season was sold when Coach named a true Freshman as a starting QB, no matter who the captains of a team are, everyone always looks to the QB for leadership and no offense to Barkley, but who would listen to a kid barely out of high school.   It’s true 8-4 is a good season under most standards, however when a program pulls top talent into the program year after year, expectations are higher.  In addition it is also how those four losses came: 2 blow outs, an uninspired game against a far inferior opponent, and a lack of offense in the final game of the year, but that again the offense vanished in the second half of most games away.  I hope this isn’t a sign of the team getting fat and happy and losing that fire, just see how well that worked out for Miami.
Pete Carroll “fell in love” with Matt Barkeley and never thought of benching him, despite Barkeley’s terrible numbers re: pics and bad passes. He had a shot at the end of the Arizona game with 3 minutes left and he blew his opportunity yet again. Three incomplete passes and a sack. No wonder Damien Williams was more than upset. Willliams was wide open and Barkeley threw him a bad pass.
It is shocking, particularly after the losses to Oregon and Stanford, that Aaron Corp or Mitch Mustain were never given a chance to play. If I were them, I would transfer.  Asked at half time whether he was concerned with Barkeley’s pck on the second play of the game on Saturday, Carroll merely said: ” We have to help Matt.” How about Matt demonstrating some leadership on the field and coverting on third down? ( 3 out of 15 is a joke).
T.J. Simer’s article in yesterday’s LA Times was right on the money.
It is disappointing to see a season like this. It just seems like they lacked motivation to win! I wonder though how bad is Mitch Mustain, that inspite of the Barkley’s spotty play he did not get a chance? Beats me!
Despite the season being over the Daily Trojan should report on the real reason we have been losing games this season – a lack of discipline.  Specifically the amount of partying and drinking players have been engaged in during the days leading up to the game. I’m in a fraternity at SC and we constantly have players at our parties often on Thursday and Friday nights before games. In fact at least 5 of our players were spotted at a party in Hollywood the night before the Arizona game. People need to know what is going on with the football program that their tuition is paying for, and maybe Pete Carroll would listen up and fix these glaring discipline issues too.
But then…I guess the players didn’t party the nights before games in prior seasons huh?
Our defense is gone. It’s not the discipline that’s gone.
“The monopoly is over,” as the UCLA coach said last season.
All good things come to an end.

December drew a frigid end of the season for a USC football team that was already getting cold.
Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
With a tie for second place in the Pac-10 and possible bid to the Holiday Bowl on the line, USC intended to send its seniors out on top after a trying year. But on a gloomy day in front of a sparse Coliseum crowd, the Trojans closed their year on an icy note.
Arizona sank USC, 21-17, on the heels of a long pass to wide receiver Juron Criner, who fought off a defender into the end zone after hauling in the catch on the sideline. With three minutes remaining after the score, USC could not get a first down on the following drive and watched helplessly as quarterback Matt Barkley was sacked on the final play of the game.
The loss brought a bitter close to a season that many players called disappointing and frustrating.
“It feels so different where we have been and what we have done,” USC coach Pete Carroll said. “It never really kicked in like we wanted to.
USC’s offense languished for most of the day, generating only 282 yards against the Wildcats. Barkley completed 20 of his 37 passes for 144 yards and a touchdown against one interception. Running back Allen Bradford tied the game in the third-quarter on a 5-yard touchdown run and finished with 66 yards.
Despite showing flashes of promise, the Trojans’ attack was plagued by inconsistency.
“We have to put a complete game together and that’s on me,” said USC quarterbacks coach and playcaller Jeremy Bates.
But Carroll said USC’s ongoing offensive woes were not to blame for the loss.
“It was a day for the defense to win the football game and they didn’t get that done,” Carroll said.
The Wildcats controlled the ball for most of the first half, converting several third-downs and keeping USC’s offense off the field. Nick Foles plunged into the endzone on a quarterback keeper to give Arizona a 14-7 lead at the half.
But Arizona struggled to generate offense after the break.
“We broke down a little bit and didn’t execute,” Arizona coach Mike Stoops said.
The Wildcats got the big play they needed, though, on the 36-yard dart to Criner that proved to be the difference.
“They were in press coverage. If people try to press us, we try to hit fades,” Stoops said. “He put the ball where it needed to be.
With a long break before the team’s yet-to-be-announced bowl game, several players were stewed on the unsatisfying finish. But some players refused to be bitter about the loss.
“I can’t hang my head because I’ve been blessed with everything I’ve been able to do here,” said senior safety Taylor Mays, playing his final game in the Coliseum.
Said fellow senior safety Will Harris: “It’s just been an emotional and frustrating year, but we dealt with it the best we could.”
The Trojans’ fourth in-conference defeat marked a high for Carroll in his time at USC. After a long run of dominant play at home, the Trojans have now lost two of their last three games at the Coliseum.
“It’s one of those things you grow up dreaming about, beating USC here,” Foles said.
The loss sent the Trojans tumbling down the Pac-10 standings and pecking order for bowls. The Poinsettia Bowl is now USC’s most likely destination, according to a USC spokesman, although the Las Vegas Bowl and Emerald Bowl remained options following the game.
The years of playing in the Rose Bowl and for Pac-10 championships appeared to be distant memories for several players.
“That’s why guys come here, to have that opportunity,” said senior guard Jeff Byers, who played his final home game in a six-year career. “You have to remember and take advantage of that on every play because you never know when it’s over or when you’re going to get another shot.”
USC lost to Texas because they had a 12 point lead with 6 minutes to play and the DEFENSE couldn’t make a play or get a stop on Vince Young….the O in that game performed just fine. I do agree they need a new O coordinator though. I believe they totally lost faith in Barkley since he had as many INTS as TD passes. He scared them straight as it were. Pete Carroll had a lot of faith in Barkley, the O coordinator did not.
I’m sorry but USC needs a new offensive coordinator.  I wanted to reach through the TV screen and grab the fancy play sheet out of his hands.  The USC “O” was boring and predictable.  How many third and long situations did we see a draw or basic run forcing a punt.  USC lost to Texas because of the same mentality and its time to get creative and bring in new blood to run the offense.

The setup: Hoping to ride the emotional high of its victory over UCLA last weekend, USC welcomed surprise Pac-10 contender Arizona into the Coliseum for the Trojan’s Senior Day, looking to end its regular season on a high note.
Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The story: Arizona took advantage of a uneven Trojan offense and marred Senior Day, walking out of the Coliseum with a 21-17 victory, its first in the stadium since 2000.
“Obviously its extremely disappointing for our seniors, we wanted them to go out on the right note,” coach Pete Carroll said.
The Wildcats racked up 321 total yards including quarterback Nick Foles’ 239 passing yards and two touchdowns.
Foles and the Arizona offense gave the Trojans fits all day, especially on third-down situations, where the Wildcats converted nine of 17 opportunities – many of which came on third-and-long plays.
“They were as hot as they could be on third-down,” Carroll said.
Although the Trojans held the ball for less than 10 minutes in the first half, they found themselves down just seven heading into the half, on the strength of a touchdown reception from junior wide receiver Ronald Johnson.
Another touchdown in the second half and a field goal gave the Trojans a momentary lead, but a methodical 10-play 80-yard drive for the final score of the game from the Wildcats sealed the victory.
Given the chance for one final play, freshman quarterback Matt Barkley was sacked looking for an opening, and the Trojans were unable to secure a 10-win season for the first time since 2001.
Play of the game: Wildcat wide receiver Juron Criner’s leaping, stumbling 36-yard touchdown grab to cap off Arizona’s drive late in the fourth quarter secured the victory for the Wildcats.
After Foles had thrown a similar jump ball earlier in the game to set up the Wildcat’s second touchdown, the sophomore tried the same throw to the opposite side of the field, this time converting the attempt for a touchdown.
Injuries strike again: Fourth-year junior running back Allen Bradford, who led the team in rushing on Saturday, scored in the third quarter to tie the game and seemed to be keying the Trojans’ success early in the second half. However, when the fourth quarter rolled around, Bradford was nowhere to be seen.
“[Bradford] was really hot, really on it, but he got hurt,” Carroll said. “He had a knee that was banged against and he just couldn’t come back out.”

The senior class: After saying goodbye to a Coliseum crowd of 83,753, the senior class finished the season without a ticket to Pasadena for Rose Bowl booked for the first time in their four years.
“It’s just frustrating,” fifth-year senior safety Will Harris said. “Its been an emotional and frustrating year for us but we did the best we can.”
Harris, who recorded his team-leading fourth interception of the season during the game, was in an unfamiliar place after the game.
“I’ve never been a part of something like this [during my time] here,” Harris said. “All I can do is to be a leader and let the younger guys know that we can still finish strong the bowl game.”
