On March 10-March 14, the USC Students for Justice in Palestine are holding Palestine Awareness Week. The week will feature a variety of evening events focusing on and discussing a wide range of topics such as student activism and solidarity. The mock apartheid wall pictured above is displayed at the Von KleinSmid Center courtyard for the duration of the week’s festivities.
Arafat is a paid Hasbara (propaganda) troll hanging out at all the campus boards. Obviously he/she cuts and paste the same messages over and over and over again.. Curious how much are you making now after all these years doing this?  I hear it’s very low  pay. Why be used by the Israeli Ministry campaign?  I say get off the computer and get a real job, something ethical you can be proud of doing.  BTW  i just broke my own rules, never feed the troll. They are pest.
Mary,
It might be worth your while to take issue with points I’ve raised which you disagree with.  That is what adults are supposed to do, you know.
It’s a cop-out accusing me of this, that or the other thing instead of arguing the points at hand.
While Gaza ranks among the top ten regions in the world for obesity in nearby Syria the Palestinians are being starved to death by their own brothers and sisters.  A good topic for SJP, no?
Palestinians are being starved to death. But this is not happening in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. Nor is it taking place in Israel.
Rather, this is happening in an Arab country, Syria, while the international community continues to turn a blind eye to the tragedy.
At least 15 Palestinians have died from starvation since last September in the Palestinian Yarmouk refugee camp near Damascus, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).
UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness said, “We have received reports over the weekend that at least five more Palestinian refugees in the besieged refugee camp of Yarmouk in Damascus have died due to malnutrition, bringing the total number of reported cases (of starvation) up to 15.”
According to reports from Syria, some 20,000 Palestinians living in Yarmouk face death from starvation as a result of the siege on the camp that began last July.
Yarmouk has been under siege by the Syrian army after a large number of gunmen belonging to the Syrian opposition found shelter inside the camp.
Yet it is not only the Syrians who are besieging the camp. A radical Palestinian group called Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, which is loyal to Bashar Assad, is also taking part in the siege.
Human rights activists say the Syrian authorities are refusing to allow aid into the camp, creating a severe humanitarian crisis.
You cannot be serious. Palestine must be returned to Palestinians. Forget all the lame whines and awful revisionism from these propagndist impostors.
Blake this one is for you:
Why is it Muslims are free to violently conquer lands anywhere and everywhere without a word of protest from American Muslims, or any Muslims or any liberals? 
But if Jews have a legally established homeland Muslims and Liberals and their ilk will never stop protesting against it? Why is this do you suppose? What explanation can be
given other than as the Qur’an states repeatedly that Islam’s goal is to establish a worldwide caliphate in which all non-Muslims are subjugated.  And, of course liberals simply cannot think rationally.
For instance, Mohammed was born around 571 AD thousands and thousands of years after Hinduism, Buddhism and Judaism existed. But within a few centuries of Mohammed’s birth Islam had violently conquered vast sections of Asia, all of North Africa and smaller sections of Southern Europe. 
Now Muslims tell us that all this land belongs to them even though, for instance, in Afghanistan they killed every last Buddhist who once lived there. According to Muslim logic per Israel shouldn’t this land belong to the Buddhists? 
Or in North Africa all the Berbers have been forcibly converted to Islam or have been killed and now we’re told all this vast landmass belongs to Islam. That’s interesting, if not completely hypocritical. 
And what about Southern Thailand. Did anyone know that in the last several years something like 5,000 Buddhists have been killed by Muslims because, or so we’re told, the land the Buddhists are on belongs to Islam. 
And Southern Russia? Muslims are relentlessly waging a slow reign of terror in Russia because, you guessed it, Russians are treating Muslims poorly and they should give up the Southern section of that country to Muslims since Islam deserves all lands.
Or, let’s take Sudan as another example. How many millions have been killed in Sudan? How many babies and children have starved in Sudan while Islamists steal the food from aid compounds? How many women have Muslims gang-raped in Sudan
all because that land belongs to Muslims and only Muslims. All other people can go somewhere else to live, I guess. 
And Kashmir? The same. Despite Hindus having lived there for 3,000 years – something like 2,000+ years before Mohammed was born – Muslims tell us Kashmir belongs to them. Amazing logic isn’t it? Muslim logic, I guess.
And that brings us to Israel. Israel also belongs to Islam too. Did you know that? It’s true. Just ask a Muslim or a liberal if you prefer.  Even though it’s no bigger than a small pimple on the caliphate’s ass it is still their land and they will fight to the death to prove their
point. 
Doesn’t the logic here make a lot of sense. Isn’t it as clear as day? Of course it does. The world belongs to Islam and we’re mere players on their stage.
Gee….I wonder if anyone from SJP will discuss the following:
Palestinian schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip have been denied the opportunity to learn about human rights after the Hamas government determined that such a subject “dangerously contravenes Palestinian and Islamic culture.”
Hamas’s announcement came in response to an attempt by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to include a course on human rights in schools run by the agency in the Gaza Strip.
The UNRWA bid drew strong condemnations from the Hamas government, whose representatives accused the international agency of seeking to “brainwash” Palestinian children.
Gee…what are the odds they openly discuss this:
Feb 13, 2013
In another story the Western media apparently refuses to cover, any Palestinian who dares to criticize Hamas or the Palestinian Authority risks being arrested or summoned for interrogation.
Palestinian journalists are now hoping to bring this to the attention of President Barack Obama when he meets with President Mahmoud Abbas next month.
The journalists say they want United States and the rest of the world to know that the crackdown on freedom of expression in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip is designed to hide the fact that Palestinians are governed by two repressive regimes that have no respect for human rights and democracy.

The Keck School of Medicine of USC participated in a breakthrough clinical trial of the Alair Bronchial Thermoplasty System, an outpatient treatment mechanism created by Boston Scientific that provides lasting relief to patients with chronic asthma.
“There is no cure for the disease, but bronchial thermoplasty has been shown to improve a patient’s quality of life by reducing his or her asthma attacks and asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits,” said Richard Barbers, pulmonologist and professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC and lead investigator of the trial at USC, in a press release.
Patients with asthma are unable to breathe normally because of swelling and subsequent narrowing of their airways. The Alair system, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2010, uses radiofrequency energy to generate mild heat and reduce the thickness of the airway muscles, allowing the patient to breathe more easily.
During treatment, patients undergo three hourlong sessions over two months during which a small tube is inserted into the lungs through the nose or mouth. The trial that USC participated in revealed a 32 percent reduction in asthma attacks after sessions.
Asthma affects approximately 22 million people in the United States and kills as many as 4,000 annually. The Alair system can provide proven lasting relief. Currently, the most common side effect is a temporary worsening of symptoms.
“Asthma is a lifelong condition that can dramatically affect a person’s quality of life,” said Scott Evans, CEO of Keck Hospital of USC and the USC Norris Cancer Hospital, in a press release. “At USC, our doctors and staff are committed to finding innovative ways to restore our patients’ health.”

As part of Palestine Awareness Week, USC Students for Justice in Palestine invited documentarian David Sheen to discuss Israel’s treatment of Palestinian refugees and the impact of such policies on the region in the Social Sciences Building on Monday.
Refugees · Documentarian David Sheen spoke to students about the Israeli government’s widespread deportation of African refugees. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
There are approximately 55,000 African asylum seekers in Israel, coming mainly from the Sudan and Eritrea.
“If you compare Israel to the Western nations it wants to be compared to, you see it pales in number of Eritrean asylum seekers,” Sheen said.  “Israel leads the world in having the highest refugee rejection rate by far. Because, from the Israeli government’s perspective, none of these people are refugees.”
Sheen started the presentation by asking the audience to imagine the United States if Jews were forced to ride in separate buses and were not allowed to rent apartments. Then, the documentarian paralleled these hypothetical situations with the Israeli situation.
“This isn’t theoretical,” Sheen said. “It’s what takes place every day. To understand how far back in America you would need to go to see a similar affair, you would need to go to 1850, when Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act.”
In January 2012, the Israeli government past an anti-filtration law meant to deter the arrival of further asylum seekers. By May 2012, there were anti-refugee riots on the street with shops and cars looted.
“You would think after this pogrom people would say ‘How did we get here?’” Sheen said. “But, in the week that followed, polls showed that people supported this.”
When South Sudan became a country, Israel began the first deportations, sending back refugees that were from the region. Sheen explained that some children who had been born in Israel died when they reached Sudan because of a lack of immunization and medical care. Refugees who are sent back receive money from Israel.
Without the right to work, African refugees in Israel need to take in “underground” jobs that pay low wages, leaving many refugees on the street.
Sheen also spoke about the racism in Israel that exists for both for Jewish and non-Jewish Africans.
“Jews of color also face racism,” Sheen said. “White supremacy is as much of a problem there as it is here. It is also the case where there is nativism. People who immigrated less recently believe they deserve more rights and privileges than people who immigrated more recently. But in addition to all this, you then have Jewish supremacy.”
Monday’s presentation was the first of Palestine Awareness Week, the annual event put on by USC SJP to raise awareness about Palestine and the occupation.
Following the event, many students in attendance expressed concern of the issue of refugees in Israel.
“I consider myself a person who tries to educate herself on world events, and it’s still pretty much the first I’ve heard about this issue,” said Nora Snyder, a senior majoring in international relations and Middle East studies. “The level of the crisis and the human rights violations that’s going on — it’s just mind-blowing that I haven’t heard about it and people here haven’t heard about it. It speaks to how this isn’t being covered by the media.”
Dan Rais, a junior majoring in the music industry, did not agree with all of Sheen’s point, but believed his work was important for increasing awareness.
“I am deeply embarrassed as a Jew of what Israel has become and what it is becoming,” Rais said. “I think the work of David Sheen, though I may not agree with certain aspects of his presentation, is very productive for raising awareness within student circles and Jewish circles and Palestinian circles about what is going on in Israel so that we can find solutions to the problems we are facing in      Israel-Palestine.”
Ifrah Sheikh, president of SJP, stressed the value of Palestine Awareness Week as a whole.
“The importance of Palestine Awareness Week on [the USC] campus is because it’s a very apathetic campus,”  Sheikh said. “In terms of activism, it falls short and this is a chance for us to really get out a narrative that is not spoken about on this campus. The week is a way to offer a lot of different experiences and insights into different aspects of the conflict and the occupation in a short time frame.”
Another main feature of Palestine Awareness Week is the mock apartheid wall and a lecture by UCI Professor of African-American Studies Sohail Daulatzai.
The wall, put up on the steps of the Von Kleinsmid Center, was borrowed from UCLA’s Students for Justice in Palestine, and it includes information about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its history. Professor’s Daulatzai’s lecture will take place on Thursday in the Science Lecture Hall.
What does the treatment of refugees in Israel have to do with “Palestine Awareness Week?”
Why would Students for Justice in Palestine care about how Israel treats African asylum seekers?
Gosh, I wonder why these refugees are applying for citizenship in Israel and not any of the Islamic countries in the Middle East?
Did our resident genius address this question?
Furthermore, the refugees in question are seeking asylum because Muslim jihadists have made living in their own country impossible.  Minor detail, no doubt to the self-serving SJP members.
This is remarkable.
Not one Palestinian has been accepted as a citizen by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar or many other Muslim nations yet SJP plays statistical games to make Israel look bad.
What a bunch of hypocritical BS.

The national Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity announced that the organization’s Supreme Council would ban its “pledging” process, effective Sunday.
Trouble on 28th Street · Sigma Alpha Epsilon joins Zeta Beta Tau and Lambda Chi Alpha as a fraternity that has banned pledging. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The announcement was made two days before the fraternity’s 158th Founders’ Day and was motivated by a number of deadly incidents surrounding SAE’s pledging process.
“We have experienced a number of incidents and deaths, events with consequences that have never been consistent with our membership experience,” a statement released by the fraternity stated.
Nationally, SAE has seen 10 alcohol-related deaths since 2006, the highest number of any fraternity in the last eight years, according to data collected by Bloomberg.
To combat the negative experiences associated with the “pledging” process, SAE is implementing a new policy they are calling “The True Gentleman Experience.”
The new guidelines have three main tenets: Members must be initiated within 96 hours of receiving a bid, chapters are asked to suspend pledge education in favor of member education for all brothers regardless of their time in the chapter and the expectations and requirements are intended to hold all members of the chapter accountable.
Matt Kasten, president of the California Gamma chapter of SAE at USC, agreed with the new policy.
“I absolutely support the fraternity’s decision and any measure that has the potential to change young men’s lives [and] create a safe and constructive environment for our members,” Kasten said.
In accordance with the new policy, SAE’s 2014 pledge class at USC was initiated Sunday night. The True Gentleman Experience program guidelines, which were released on Friday, state that all current pledges must be initiated by March 11.
The California Gamma chapter will now look toward its fall recruitment, during which Kasten believes the new policy will have a positive impact on incoming members.
“[The policy] definitely has the opportunity to be an advantage to potential new members … so there is no reason why this should adversely affect recruitment,” Kasten said. “There is absolutely some worth to have a pledge experience to get to know a group of guys, but they can still get to know each other but be seen as brothers and equal members of the house.”
In a statement posted on the SAE website, the fraternity addressed more than 25 possible questions that chapters might have regarding the new policy. Many of the questions addressed concerns about recruitment and the importance of the bonding experience during the pledging period.
“From day one, members should be treated as equals because you are asking those men to join to be your brothers,” the statement said. “You will still be making friends, and your experiences should occur together as a chapter, not as individual classes of members.”
The USC Interfraternity Council echoed these sentiments. Ehren Elder, executive vice president of administrative affairs for IFC, said the importance of pledge-class bonding varies from chapter to chapter and individual to individual.
“SAE will [not] be missing out on anything inherent,” Elder said. “The process of becoming initiated is important, but they will still be getting the full initiation process.”
Though IFC had no role in SAE’s Supreme Council decision, IFC has said it supports SAE’s new policy.
“We will stand behind them in any way we can,” said Austin Horton, IFC’s vice president of communications. “This isn’t to say that this new process is or isn’t the only way to go about new member education. There are various methods of new member education that work and do not need to be changed.”
In response to whether or not the IFC would ever consider implementing a similar ban on pledging for all fraternities, Elder said the council has not explored anything similar to SAE’s 96-hour rule.
“We have implemented a policy about alcohol education and continue to improve it, but we have not taken a stance on whether a     96-hour rule is positive or negative, or if we would ever do something like that — we have not explored it,” Elder said.
SAE will join other fraternities, including Zeta Beta Tau and Lambda Chi Alpha, that have banned pledging at the national level. The North-American Interfraternity Conference stated its support for SAE’s “bold initiative to eliminate pledging” as well its stance against hazing and alcohol in new member programs.
“We support the efforts of all member fraternities to address these critical issues within their organizations,” said Peter D. Smithhisler, CEO of NIC.
Kasten said he understands and respects the reasoning behind the Supreme Council’s decision.
“There have been a lot of unfortunate hazing-related deaths nationally that were leveraged by brothers dangling initiation at the end of the semester in front of pledges,” Kasten said. “So they were doing things they wouldn’t ordinarily do that were reckless and unsafe, and it’s really tragic.”
One such tragedy occurred at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo in 2008, when freshman Carson Starkey died of alcohol poisoning during an SAE hazing incident.
SAE has one of the highest costs of any Greek organization for liability insurance. If the new policy can prove a long-term reduction in incidents, the organization anticipates that it will help chapters secure a lower health and safety fee, according to the fraternity’s website.
Time to close down the entire row!
SAE is the downfall of the row and should be abolished completely.
I can’t agree or disagree with that comment, SAE has been a great house at USC and like others has had it’s problem members that change the culture at times. I only know that as a member of a pledge class from the late 70’s, one of my fellow brothers stated that the house was out of control with Hazing. Hazing was not a part of our pledgeship from that era. We retired the Iron man trophy in 1979 for a run from 77-79. We had to carry a brick during pledship and did a few chores around the house. Hazing is BS and has to stop. It doesn’t make you a man. My friends son just pledged recently, and didn’t even look at SAE and committed a cardinal sin as a catholic my pledging the house across the street.
The problem of hazing is a matter that needs to be addressed.  It is not what a fraternal experience is supposed to be.  I applaud SAE’s effort, but question the insta-bro approach they are taking?  Seems like a at least four weeks is required to shape up the pledges into good active brothers.  On another note, I do want to take issue with Joe Rybus regarding the coveted Ironman trophy.  As a ATO alumni, and former athletic chairman for what was hands down the best fraternity at USC in the 1980s, SAE’s short lived success in the late 1970’s is nothing compared to our three straight championships in the 1980’s.  Back then we had hundreds of the brothers and little sisters attending our events and really dominated.  I think in those years we made the finals of every major sport.  I know SAE had a solid Volleyball squad, but I don’t remember them being that competitive in the others.  Anyway, hats off to SAE for addressing this important issue.

After dropping a match to crosstown rival UCLA this past weekend, the USC women’s tennis team looks to get back to its winning ways today against Baylor. The match will be the Women of Troy’s last non-conference contest  before USC flies out to face Colorado in Boulder, Colo. for the first official match of Pac-12 conference play. 
The No. 6 Women of Troy (9-3) fell to No. 3 UCLA, 5-2, on their home court last Friday. Though the loss was disappointing, it was an improvement from the last time these two teams matched up this season, when the Bruins swept the Women of Troy, 4-0, in the quarterfinals of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Team Indoor Championships in Charlottesville, Va. on Feb. 8.
USC’s top-ranked doubles pair, made up of juniors Zoë Scandalis and Giuliana Olmos, fell to UCLA’s top doubles pair, Robin Anderson and Jennifer Brady, 8-6. But Scandalis, ranked the 30th-best singles player in the country, beat No. 3 Anderson in singles play by a score of 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (6-1). Scandalis was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week on March 5 for her strong play the week before.
Scandalis played on court one against UCLA in place of junior Sabrina Santamaria, whose season was recently cut short by an ACL tear. Santamaria also previously paired with senior Kaitlyn Christian on court one in doubles, after the duo won the national championship together last year. USC is still adjusting to the loss of Santamaria and will look to work out the kinks in the lineup against Baylor today.
The Baylor Lady Bears come into Marks Stadium ranked as the No. 18 team in the country, sporting a 9-4 record. The Lady Bears are led by doubles pair Victoria Kisialeva and Blair Shankle, ranking as the 42nd-best tandem in the country and owning a 9-1 record in match play so far this year. On the singles side, 38-ranked Kiah Generette leads the Lady Bears with an 8-3 individual record.
Some members of USC’s women’s team were spectators at Marks Stadium on Sunday, when the men’s squad took on Baylor’s men’s team. The Trojans were able to pull off a 5-2 win over the 12th-ranked Bears.
The Women of Troy’s only other losses this season also came at the ITA National Team Indoor Tournament at the hands of the Florida Gators, ranked No. 2 in the country according to the most recent ITA poll. The Women of Troy did come away from the tournament with a signature win over Alabama, however, currently ranked fourth in the nation. Other notable wins for USC in the early season include a victory over No. 24 Texas as well as No. 16 Cal.
Though Cal and UCLA are both a part of the Pac-12, those matches are considered non-conference matches as they happened in tournaments and not standard conference play.
Along with USC, UCLA and Cal, Stanford will be an early-season contender for the conference championship. Stanford is ranked ninth in the country and doesn’t play USC until hosting the Women of Troy on April 5. After going undefeated in Pac-12 play last year, the Women of Troy look to repeat as undefeated conference champions before heading into the NCAA Tournament.
USC’s match against Baylor begins at 1:30 p.m. today at Marks Stadium.
It will be the last match at home for the Women of Troy until March 28, when they return from a series of Pac-12 road trips to host Oregon.

USC’s baseball team fell to 8-6 on the season this weekend after a less-than-stellar home stand that included three losses at home to Houston, Pepperdine and UCLA. It was a weekend full of missed opportunities in terms of advancing runners on base as well as key fielding mistakes, allowing the Trojans’ opponents to score more and more runs.

The weekend started out with a 6-1 loss to Houston on Friday, then a 10-4 loss to Pepperdine on Saturday and finally a close 6-5 loss to crosstown rival UCLA on Sunday.
USC head coach Dan Hubbs believes that each of these losses can be attributed to slightly different factors.
“I think Friday we just got beat in every facet by Houston, whose pitcher pitched fantastic, but that’s just kind of baseball,” Hubbs said. “Saturday we jumped out to a lead early on then couldn’t extend that lead and proceeded to give up a bunch of hits later in the game. Sunday we were in key positions but made huge errors. We just gave them too much.”
Despite this disappointing showing, Hubbs feels confident that the new week will present a fresh start for the Trojans and allow them to rekindle their winning streak.
“We’re in a little bit of a rut, but we just have to play clean baseball,” Hubbs said. “If we do that, we know we’ll win. There’s no doubt we should’ve beat UCLA Sunday. We just made too many mistakes on easy plays, but I know these guys won’t makes those same mistakes moving forward.”
The Trojans will kick off this week at home in a match against the 9-7 Loyola Marymount Lions tonight at 6 p.m. The Lions are on something of a hot streak at the moment, coming to USC’s Dedeaux Field fresh off seven straight wins.
Hubbs believes that if the Trojans can eliminate stolen bases from the speedy Lions, they stand a good chance at winning tonight.
“Loyola Marymount can really run, but one thing we’ve done really well so far this season is preventing a lot of stolen bases,” Hubbs said. “Since stealing bases is such a huge part of their game, I think we’ll be able to match up really well in that respect.”
Even though Loyola Marymount has played well recently, the Lions appear evenly matched with the Trojans. In terms of overall batting average, the Lions currently hold a .283 team average in comparison to the Trojans’ .288. USC’s pitching staff also currently boasts a slightly better ERA than Loyola Marymount, given the Trojans’ 3.00 ERA in comparison to the Lions’ 3.64.
Numbers aside, Hubbs predicts that the outcome of tonight’s game will depend heavily on the mindset and confidence of the players on both teams.
All smiles · Despite the Trojans’ four-game skid, senior 3B Kevin Swick, who is batting .410 on the season and was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week on March 4 for the first time in his career, has plenty to be happy about. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
“It’s more about how you come out as opposed to how you match up,” Hubbs said. “Loyola Marymount has a good balance of right and left-handed pitchers and batters. They’re a talented team who can beat us and we’re more than capable of beating them. Whoever plays best will win the game.”
For tonight’s lineup, junior Garrett Stubbs will catch and freshman Jeremy Martinez will come in as the designated hitter.
Hubbs says that above all, the Trojans must deliver in the clutch if they want to break their four-game losing streak tonight.
“There just comes a point in time when a player needs to come through in a big spot, whether that be in terms of hitting, pitching or fielding,” Hubbs said. “We just have to do what we did during the first couple of games of the season, which is pitch well and play good defense.”
First pitch is set for 6 p.m. tonight. Next up for the Trojans is a trip north for a weekend series against Oregon.

After finishing the regular season with a dismal 11-20 record, including a 2-16 mark in Pac-12 play, USC’s men’s basketball team heads to Las Vegas for the Pac-12 Tournament this week. Head coach Andy Enfield would have to lead the Trojans to the tournament title to have any shot at making the NCAA Tournament, but chances are slim considering the Trojans would have to face top-seeded Arizona in the semifinals, if they beat Colorado and Cal to make it there. Daily Trojan sports columnists Nick Selbe, Will Laws, Darian Nourian, Jacob Freedman and Nick Burton discussed the team’s first-round matchup against Colorado and its chances going forward. 
 
Left out · Despite ranking sixth in the conference in points per game, junior guard Byron Wesley wasn’t named to any All-Pac-12 team. Still, the Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. native will need to stay sharp in the Pac-12 Tournament. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Q: USC faces Colorado in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament. The first time these teams met this season, the Buffaloes took topped the Trojans by 21 points. When USC hosted Colorado a month later, the Buffaloes won again, this time by a nine-point margin. What do the Trojans have to do differently to win this game?
Selbe: USC must do a better job of slowing down Colorado’s guards. Top guard Askia Booker had 18 points, eight rebounds and six assists, pacing the Buffaloes’ offensive attack [in the most recent matchup]. USC was without senior point guard Pe’Shon Howard, who was out with a suspension. That left Enfield with limited options at the guard position, which cost the Trojans on the defensive end. With Howard back for the Pac-12 Tournament, USC’s defense should be improved.
Laws: In the first contest, even though Colorado had just lost star guard Spencer Dinwiddie for the season, the Buffs still routed USC by 21 points. In both games, USC gave up 83 points. The Trojans will have to be more disciplined on defense — but they’ve had that problem all season long, so it’s hard to see that changing now.
Nourian: The Trojans have to play really well and not just for a stretch during the game, but for the whole 40 minutes, which they have struggled to do all season. Colorado, however, is just a better all-around team than the Trojans, as five Buffaloes scored in double figures in their last meeting, so it’s going to be tough to stop them, especially former Mater Dei star Xavier Johnson who dropped a team-high 20 points the last time around. USC is also going to have to get out to Colorado’s shooters behind the three-point line and not jump out to a slow start. In Colorado, the Trojans faced a 20-2 deficit to begin the game, which can’t happen in the NCAA Tournament.
Burton: Be smart. The Trojans are not as bad as their record indicates, but they have been plagued this season by inexplicable lapses in concentration. Each loss has seemed to include a lull where the Trojans just sort of lose focus, taking bad shots and committing dumb turnovers. Generally, the severity of the loss correlates to the length of the lull. Clearly this is easier said than done, but … don’t have a lull.
Freedman: Get more aggressive down low. It’s been a struggle for senior centers Omar Oraby and D.J. Haley on defense against the Buffs this year, as Colorado big men Xavier Johnson and Josh Scott have scored 67 points in two games against USC this season. Haley has been playing well of late, and if USC can limit, not stop, Colorado in the paint, then the Trojans could combine that with hot shooting into an upset.
 
Q: Should USC win its first-round matchup, the team would advance to play Cal. How do the Trojans match up against the Bears?
Selbe: USC actually matches up well against Cal. The Trojans dominated in the two teams’ first meeting at the Galen Center in a 77-69 win, the Trojans’ first conference win of the season. In the second matchup, the game was tightly contested for most of the game, despite USC playing without a suspended Byron Wesley. Cal plays more with a finesse style, which bodes well for USC. At full strength, the Trojans should, at the very least, hang tough with the Bears, especially considering that Cal enters the tournament having lost four of its last six games.
Laws: Not going to happen.
Nourian: USC isn’t going to win its first-round matchup against Colorado, but in the event that the team does, the Trojans actually match up very well with the Bears, having beaten them earlier in conference play, one of just two conference wins. With [freshman forward] Nikola Jovanovic and [senior center] Omar Oraby up front, the Trojans have a size advantage and out-rebounded the Golden Bears in their last meeting [at the Galen Center].
Burton: Cal is, amazingly, one of USC’s two Pac-12 wins this season. They can, in theory, run with almost anyone in the conference, including the Bears. But there’s no questioning who the better team is.
Freedman: Out of all the teams, I was rooting for USC to face Cal in the opening round. They’ve already defeated the Golden Bears this season, and given that Cal is not a great offense squad, USC’s guards could go off and spring another win.
 
Q: USC enters the tournament as the 12th and lowest seed. Is there any way the Trojans can muster a title run?
Selbe: A title run seems out of the question for USC this season. As the team showed during the regular season conference schedule, it just doesn’t have the firepower to consistently beat Pac-12 competition. To make matters worse, Enfield inherited a roster that doesn’t quite fit his style, and as a result, the Trojans haven’t looked particularly sharp on offense all season. The team has made a habit of keeping the game close in the first half, then fading quickly in the second, usually as a result of a prolonged scoring drought. Maybe Enfield can spark some postseason magic like he did last year at Florida Gulf Coast, but after watching the Trojans struggle their way to a 2-16 conference record, that seems highly unlikely.
Laws: If they did, it’d be one of the greatest run of upsets in a major conference tournament ever. But they won’t. USC’s defense is simply not good enough this year to win four straight games against Pac-12 competition. Wins over Colorado and Cal are not out of the realm of possibility, but there’s no way the Trojans will advance past Arizona in the semifinals. Even a win over the Buffs would be shocking, though.
Nourian: There is a better chance that I get drafted by an NBA team than the Trojans winning the Pac-12 Tournament. Sorry to be pessimistic, but it’s just not going to happen.
Burton: As surprising as the women’s Pac-12 Championship is, they would have nothing on the men’s squad if the impossible were to happen. And yet, that’s why they play the games. Like I said, the Trojans are not as bad as their record. I, however, take some sort of sick, schadenfreude-like pleasure from the basketball team’s struggles (because seriously, how else would it be enjoyable?), so I’m gonna say no.
Freedman: No. These Trojans have shown that they can compete with anyone in the Pac-12 for 20 to 30 minutes. Yet only twice in the Pac-12 have they held on to win a game in the second half, and both of their wins were them staving off comebacks. The Trojans simply don’t have the consistency to reel off two strong halves, let alone four  straight wins.
USC plays Colorado tomorrow  at 2:30 p.m. at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The game will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.

On Sunday, the USC women’s basketball team clinched its first NCAA Tournament bid since 2006 by winning the Pac-12 Tournament championship. The Women of Troy won four games in four days, something that had never been done before in the history of the conference tournament.
Ringleader · Senior forward Cassie Harberts scored 10 straight points in USC’s upset of top-seeded Stanford in the Pac-12 Tournament semis. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
“That’s what this team is about. That’s what these players are about. That’s what this band is about, the university, our program — I am so proud of them,” an elated head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said in her postgame interview with ESPN. “[Winning four games in four days] hasn’t been done because you need to grind. You need to have heart. And let me tell you — these kids fought all season long. I’m proud of them.”
Cooper-Dyke’s praise for her players is well-deserved. Two weeks ago, this was a team whose NCAA Tournament bubble appeared to have burst after three consecutive losses, including back-to-back home losses, which dropped its record to 16-12. For a roster full of players who had never played in the NCAA Tournament and had very little postseason experience (save for senior forwards Cassie Harberts and Desireé Bradley, who played on the 2010-11 team that advanced to the finals of the women’s NIT), nobody could have expected the Women of Troy to rally from such a deep hole.
But that’s what’s so special about college basketball this time of year — something improbable happens that no one saw coming. USC came up short in the tiebreaker with Arizona State for fourth place, meaning the team wouldn’t get a first-round bye in the conference tournament. This might have been a blessing in disguise, however, as the team eked out a closer-than-expected 59-54 win over last-place Arizona.
The close victory would serve as an indicator of things to come. USC edged out ASU in the next round 59-57, setting up a semifinal showdown with No. 4 Stanford. The Cardinal are among the most dominant teams in women’s college basketball in recent years, with five Final Four appearances in the past six seasons.
From the opening tip, however, USC was every bit Stanford’s equal. After playing the first half to a 32-32 tie, the Women of Troy were the better team coming out of the locker room, building a 10-point lead with just under 11 minutes left. After Stanford stormed back to take a 60-57 lead with five minutes left, USC leaned on its best player — Harberts.
Harberts scored the next 10 points of the game and gave the Women of Troy a commanding 67-60 victory that held up, sending the team into a frenzy and leaving the Cardinal stunned. The celebration continued into the next night, as USC topped Oregon State in the finals and hoisted the trophy.
When Cooper-Dyke praises her players’ toughness, Harberts must be the first one that comes to mind. As a freshman on the 2010-2011 team, she started every game and got a taste of what March Madness is supposed to be like, thanks to the team’s run to the WNIT finals. What followed, however, was disappointment and underachievement.
USC seemed poised to make the tournament in her sophomore year, but had an unimpressive regular season and was upset by Washington State in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament. Last year, the team lost to Cal in the Pac-12 quarterfinals on March 8, 2013 to finish the season 11-20. Five days later, Michael Cooper resigned as head coach, leaving the program in disarray.
After enduring such turmoil, it’s fitting that Harberts was the one to lead the team in the most crucial of moments, and she is very deserving of any praise she receives. But the driving force behind USC’s surprising success is undoubtedly Cooper-Dyke.
Anyone who follows USC’s men’s team knows that rebuilding projects are not easy. Last year, the women’s team finished 11-20 overall and 7-11 in Pac-12 play. This year, the Women of Troy are 22-12 and 11-7 in conference games. This type of turnaround is the exception, rather than the rule, for teams with first-year head coaches. Considering what Cooper-Dyke went through to get her “dream job” makes this success all the more impressive.
After a decorated playing career in the WNBA, Cooper-Dyke coached at Prairie View A&M, UNC Wilmington and Texas Southern, places not exactly considered marquee coaching jobs. She found success at each stop, but she always wanted something more, and it appears that she’s found it now that she’s returned to USC.
“God is good,” an emotional Cooper-Dyke said after Sunday’s win. “These kids deserve this championship. I am so proud of them. I am ecstatic. I’m proud of this university. I am back home, and now we’re Pac-12 champions. We’re back baby! Fight on!”
Cooper-Dyke and the Women of Troy shocked everyone but themselves with this tournament championship, and now that their ticket to the Big Dance has already been punched, the only question to ask now is simple — how much further they can go?

If you saw me hobbling around campus on Monday looking as stiff as the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz, it’s because I ran the LA Marathon this weekend — and I did it without really training.
In my defense, it’s been a really busy semester. As these are my last few months as a college student, I’ve been trying to make the most of them and be as social and present as I can be rather than going off on my own to run. As an unfortunate consequence of this, I have notched a miniscule number of miles under my belt as of late.
In light of that, most of the people in my life — especially my mom, who rightfully worries about me getting injured — did not understand why I was going to go through with this race.
But for me, there was never any question. The LA Marathon holds a very special place in my heart. I ran it last year for the first time and getting to do it again this year was nothing short of exhilarating.
I dumbly fell into cross-country running as a freshman in high school. Running brought purpose, determination and love into my life. I was fortunate enough to stumble into a team that had the kind of coaches who movies try to portray. I know I became a better person by running under those coaches. Running also helped me to make some of my lifelong friends among my fellow teammates, who for four years saw me through every 6 a.m. practice and never-ending meet.
Running has kept me going through college. I actually started school in Pittsburgh, and one of the best decisions I made was to join the school’s track team. Being a part of that team helped me to learn and love a new city and culture. Running around the city — even on snow days, which were an eye opener on their own — helped me get to forge my own relationship with the city.
It might sound petty, but one of the hardest adjustments to make when I transferred to USC was finding ways to run here. At first glance, Downtown Los Angeles does not seem runner-friendly, and my early attempts to train on the hard cement only served to give me plantar fasciitis (a.k.a. “Jogger’s Heel”). But like anything, you find ways to adjust. I did physical therapy, found better shoes to buffer my legs for the city streets and eventually learned to embrace running in the city.
You build a special relationship with a city by running it. Consequently, running has helped me to form a soft spot for Downtown — its buildings, its people — OK, maybe not its smells, but hey, you can’t have everything. Finding a way to run here made me want to do my first marathon here. I’m not entirely sure why, but I think going from not knowing where to run to doing 26.2 miles around the city felt like an incredible thing to me. I’m so glad I did.
There is no better way to see Los Angeles than by running or walking the LA Marathon. People say — and rightfully so — that Los Angeles is a driving city. People also say — perhaps rightfully so — that people here can feel aloof and separated by their zip codes. For at least one day a year, I can say with certainty that neither of these stereotypes is true. The LA Marathon not only makes the city accessible by foot, it also erases any zip code distinction. Each year, when the marathon starts at Dodger Stadium, they play Randy Newman’s “I Love L.A.” Somehow, under the almost supernatural glow of the stadium lights in the early hours of the morning, that song has never felt more accurate. All 25,000 racers really do feel like one big happy Angeleno family.
The race, which goes from “stadium to sea,” where it suitably ends at the Santa Monica Pier, gives you a taste of all different parts of Los Angeles. From Chinatown to Sunset Boulevard, you get a sampling of all of what makes this city great. You can also tell the cool parts of town by where the American Apparel stores are. We passed at least four of them, by my unofficial count. But more than the geography, it is the volunteers and the people who get up early to line the course that really make the city come alive.
The running community of Los Angeles is incredible. You’d assume that most spectators are there to cheer for the people they know, but that doesn’t stop them from lending their support to all of the runners. So many people hold signs along the course that say something like, “I’m proud of you, random stranger.” The absolutely amazing volunteers who line the course with water, Gatorade and food are what make the race feasible. I was too tired to realize this last year, but incredibly, there are also a number of spectators who bring their own food and beverages to help support the racers — to the person who gave me that grape ice pop near mile 13, thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Recently, the LA Marathon was granted the honor of hosting the 2016 Olympic Team Trials for the men’s and women’s marathon. I hope the recognition will make more people aware of distance running and Los Angeles. Because, at least for me, running the city has been the most spectacular way to know the city and, in a way, the people who inhabit it. I want more people to be able to experience that. Because, to quote a hashtag for the LA Marathon on Twitter: #werunla.

For anyone looking to find a career in the fashion industry, or for anyone who just loves knowing exactly what’s next in the fashion, beauty and style worlds, the Simply Stylist Los Angeles event on March 15 is the perfect place to rub shoulders with some big names in fashion. 
The event, which will be presented by Citi and The Grove and will be held at The Grove, is a daylong experience created by fashion public relations expert and founder of the Simply Stylist brand Sarah Boyd, who knows firsthand the importance of connections for making it in the fashion industry.
“I always have tons of people coming to me asking to be connected to a stylist or to an editor, or to get their product on a celebrity, and I thought, ‘Why not create a community that can connect people and build organic networking’?” Boyd said.
With that inspiration in mind, Boyd set out to create the Simply Stylist brand, which hosts events in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York annually to inspire and connect the next generation of fashion industry hopefuls with current experts.
“The people that I get to speak to at these events can really relate to the audience and talk to them about when they had just seven cents in their pocket, or when they were starving college students before they made their way and became these huge success stories,” Boyd said.
The day will be hosted by E! News correspondent Catt Sadler and will kick off with a networking brunch sponsored by Barneys New York at the Fat Cow restaurant. The brunch is part of the VIP package for the event and will accommodate 100 guests, including the speakers for the fashion, beauty and entrepreneurship panels that will follow later in the day.
“It’s a great opportunity, especially for younger people who don’t have a lot of connections in the industry yet, to have a cocktail and say cheers with some big players and to shake some hands,” Boyd said.
Right after brunch, attendees will head over to Pacific Movie Theatres, where the different keynote speeches and panel discussions will be led by stylists, beauty experts, bloggers and fashion entrepreneurs and innovators.
On the list as keynote speakers is Miley Cyrus’ older sister, Brandi Cyrus. In addition, Popsugar’s Allison McNamara will interview Sadler. Panelists and moderators will include Raissa Gerona, co-owner and designer for fashion line Lovers + Friends, Erin Weinger from the Hollywood Reporter, editor of Racked LA Natalie Alcala, Popsugar reporter and producer Allison McNamara and celebrity stylists including Tara Swennen and Anita Patrickson, who have dressed celebrities including Miley Cyrus, Emma Watson, Kristen Stewart and Lauren Conrad.
“All our speakers are so inspirational and have such amazing careers, but they’re also going to talk about the hurdles they’ve had to overcome along the way. Everyone will be really honest and go a little deeper than just the nice fluffy success stories,” Boyd said.
Following   the panel discussions will be breakout sessions and how-to demonstrations in the Park at The Grove, led by experts including Sazan Barzani from Spaz Magazine and celebrity makeup artist Jamie Greenberg on topics including “DIY Red Carpet Beauty” and “Blogging Basics.”
“That part of the day will be a great opportunity for our guests to learn skills that they really want to know, like how to make money on a blog or how to do a great smoky eye,” Boyd said.
Simultaneously, attendees can shop some of the latest fashion and accessory trends with personal shopper and celebrity stylist Jacqueline Rezak, or be pampered with beauty treatments including manicures from Luxe Nail and Spa or eyelash extensions from Blink Bar.
“All the experts and professionals that I have at the event are really looking to engage with attendees and talk about fashion and beauty, build relationships and indulge them in the complementary treatments, like makeup by Blushington and so many other great things,” Boyd said.
There will also be a DJ spinning tunes and a photobooth, where attendees can take pictures and upload them to Instagram with the hashtag “#SSCITILA” to get prints of the photos.
With all this fashion and beauty inspiration in store for attendees, Boyd also wanted to find a way to give back. A portion of proceeds from the day will go to The Farley Project, an anti-bullying charity and campaign that promotes love, acceptance and respect.
“Just like with the event, The Farley Project is all about kindness, and giving people compliments and just, you know, starting with positivity and beauty from within because when you do it will show,” Boyd said.
Ultimately, the Simply Stylist Los Angeles event will provide attendees not only with a day of shopping, pampering and meeting successful, noteworthy professionals, but also with the opportunity to nurture the connections made at the event for the future.
“What’s so great about this day is that college students and young people just starting out can get that handshake or that business card that can lead to an internship or a job. All you need is that one connection and it could change your life,” Boyd said.
Tickets to the event are available on the Simply Stylist website. VIP Tickets are $250, Fashion & Beauty Lover tickets, which buy access to everything but the VIP brunch, are $150 and Social Butterfly tickets, which buy access to the shopping and pampering sessions, are $20. USC students can use the discount code “USC25” for 25 percent off the ticket prices at checkout.

More than a dozen teams of student filmmakers competed last month in the 18th Annual Ed Wood Film Festival. Most of these teams had only been formed days before the competition. This was not so in the case of one self-described “rag-tag group of underdog come-from-behind college filmmakers” known as the Origami Team. And the Origami Team dared to make more than just a short film for Ed Wood.

At Ed Wood, audience members and filmmakers alike were surprised by a mysterious figure: a man dressed in a gray suit with what appeared to be bloodstains on the collar and a bag on his head reading, “I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE.” The man sat in the back of the room and refused to speak a word to anyone. Precisely why the man acted the way he did was a mystery; some guessed it was a bizarre tribute to the recent strange behavior of Shia LaBeouf.
The first film of the night, #iamsorry, answered these questions. The film lampoons LaBeouf’s infamous performance art piece of the same name, showing the stoic Shia sitting down face-to-bag with complete strangers. After facing criticism, anger and even sexual advances from these strangers, Shia goes on a killing spree, with each murder plagiarizing a different classic movie. The film — and the team behind it — wound up taking home the Best Film Editing and Audience Choice awards.
The team behind #iamsorry is no stranger to making movies — or winning awards for them, for that matter. The six members of the team — Rick Cisario, Carter Feuerhelm, Amber Laird, Keenan Mosimann, Elana Zeltser and Daniel Moya as Shia — first banded together last October for Delta Kappa Alpha’s All-Nighter film festival. Prior to the festival, the six had met as freshman film students and had become fast friends. Much like Ed Wood once did, the festival’s challenge was to write, shoot and edit a short film in only 24 hours.
“We started at about 12:30 and finished at 2 [p.m.],” Mosimann said. “With three minutes to go, the video was still exporting,” Feuerhelm added.
Their hard work paid off — the newly dubbed Origami Team took home the All-Nighter’s Best Performances award for its first video, “The Origami Roommate.” In it, Moya enlists Cisario’s help to solve the mystery of who dropped his towel into the mess that is a New/North bathroom floor. The team used no script, only a basic outline of what they thought would happen. The improvised performances give the film an energy and spontaneity that show through in the final product.
“We made a rule as a group that we would never use a script,” Moya said. “At 4 a.m., something is always funnier than what you had written.”
As far as the name goes, the group intentionally chose a bizarre, meaningless name just to keep audiences guessing.
“We tried to come up with the most random name possible, and I said, ‘Cow Time,’” Mosimann said. They eventually settled on “The Origami Roommate” for their first video, with the Origami Team referring to the group itself.
“We wanted something that’s just cryptic enough that there could be meaning there, but we didn’t have one,” Moya added.
After the All-Nighter, the group decided to continue making videos. Their second video, “Origami Halloween,” was even longer and more ambitious than their debut. Over the course of the fall semester, the Origami Team released a total of seven videos, each one receiving several thousand views. Plots range from Cisario releasing a workout video to Mosimann meticulously stealing Moya’s possessions one by one to Moya locking himself away from all human contact.
One member of the team is already familiar with YouTube success. Mosimann, known online as Criken2, has a video gaming channel with more than 470,000 subscribers. Several of his videos receiving several million views. Mosimann, however, refused to use his existing Internet fame to promote the Origami Team.
“I want to see how the Origami Team does independently first,” Mosimann said. “I want this to be its own entity.”
Since the new semester began, the Origami Team has improved its craft and experimented with different stories. “The Origami Compassion” shows the team venturing into drama for the first time, while #iamsorry shows a level of excellence in editing, camera work and acting that demonstrates the group’s growing skills as filmmakers. And, they show no signs of stopping.
“There’s a lot of ideas that we have saved and that we look forward to making,” Mosimann said. “We’re all living together next year, so we’ll have that much more freedom to make more videos.”
Despite the group’s growing popularity and success, they have not lost track of what ultimately guides everything they make: the desire to entertain.
“There’s no greater feeling in the world than someone saying that they looked at something that you made and liked it,” Feuerhelm said.

In light of the USC Panhellenic Council’s recent announcement that it will be moving the beginning of sorority recruitment to several days before USC’s fall semester begins, a question comes to mind: What’s the rush?
Next fall this will be the question more than ever before — most sorority-hopefuls will be three days into rush before they ever set foot in a college classroom. As a community, we must consider whether one’s first semester in college is the best time to rush and join a fraternity or sorority.
Choosing whether or not to go Greek is a big decision: Many Greeks consider their house, and the community that comes with it, as the highlight of their college experience as well as a networking platform for their future careers. The significant time implications of joining a house, coupled with the lack of exposure to the school’s culture as a whole, however, is a significant trade-off for an inexperienced student to make.
Though there is certainly nothing wrong with choosing to devote oneself to a Greek organization, having a semester to think about it first and whether or not it is a good fit would be beneficial for undergraduates new to USC. Pushing back rush one semester for new students allows them to acclimate to being Trojans before diving into the Greek system.
Moreover, giving students a semester of exposure to USC allows them to better understand the Greek context and what to expect. If you were going to spend dozens of hours a week with any organization at USC for the next three or four years, having more than a few days to determine if this particular one is a good fit would be advantageous.
The concept of delaying rush one semester is not unheard of. Presently, sororities at Harvard University only recruit in the spring without issue. From their view, if you haven’t found the community you were looking for during your first semester or are looking for the values the Greek system provides, by all means rush — just not in your first days as a college student.
The social element is also important to address. Is pledging a great way to make lots of friends? Absolutely. But it is not the only option available to new students. After all, the other 850 registered student organizations at USC do not require you to immediately pledge fealty seven days into college. The Greek process can make an ideal supplement to college socialization, but for those in their first semester it can easily become a substitute.
The benefits of moving rush extend beyond those for potential new members. A spring schedule would allow sorority sisters not to cut their summers short for rush school. Fraternities would also still have new pledges every semester, just not first-semester students. These new members are also less likely to drop, have a better handle on their non-Greek USC experience and be more deliberately committed to the Greek system.
So all things considered, what’s the rush?

Much of my identity has been shaped by Lindsay Lohan — or shall I say, the more wholesome Lindsay Lohan.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
As a small child, I watched The Parent Trap almost every day until my mother, an onlooker with less exposure than I, could even recite the words. Freaky Friday marked my third-grade existence; I wanted to be just like Anna: in a band and resilient against snobby popular girls. I sported a black choker for months to emulate her style. Of course, the form of Lindsay Lohan that is most embedded in the very fabric of my life is her character in Mean Girls. I quote it an annoyingly frequent amount of times a day and hope that maybe someday I’ll embody as much grace as Cady when she won Spring Fling Queen, breaking off pieces of her tiara for everyone in the crowd.
Nowadays, the Lindsay we are all familiar with is the Lindsay that parties an exorbitant amount, the one that checks in and out of rehab and seems to always miss her various court dates. Her escapades in recent years have infiltrated all media outlets and her actions are sometimes bigger news than breaking international events. She has tried to reinvent her image countless times, and as someone who has followed Lindsay for years and even idolized her at one point, it was increasingly disappointing to see her repeated downfalls. Eventually, her news became tiring, and I just resorted to watching Mean Girls for the 100th time.
On March 9, Oprah Winfrey premiered a reality show on her channel, OWN, documenting Lindsay as she picks up the pieces of her life following her very public battles with substance abuse and the law. Clips from Lindsay show the actress saying she “felt like she’s in a prison” with the camera crew constantly surrounding her and Oprah intervening, telling Lindsay to “cut the bull” for missing work. The series is an extension of the Lindsay we have all been accustomed to in the media, yet it also explains her actions. She is perceived as a party girl, but there is a back story to go along with it. Without sounding too maudlin, this series allows the audience to understand her difficult childhood and the pressures of being a child star.
Though I do commend Oprah for using her immense power to inspire change, I question, in this case, if her influence is used in the right way. Utilizing the documentary as a means of casting light on Lindsay’s flaws isn’t the type of programming one would expect from Oprah. People are curious about Lindsay’s life, and their curiosity generates ratings. Lindsay’s life — successes and failures — is used for capital gain. As a person whose life was put under a microscope, which ultimately was one of the factors that her career was put in jeopardy, Lindsay would not benefit from even more cameras in her life. Furthermore, reality television shows should be taken with a grain of salt, because sometimes the production entails for dramatic set-up.
Technicalities aside, Oprah’s new show does lead me to question why viewers, myself included, are interested in Lindsay’s not-so-shining moments at all. Is it because her life is so chaotic that it’s almost a source of entertainment for people to view it seemingly uncensored? Or is it because we want to support her as an underdog? Either way, discriminating against Lindsay’s troubles invites generalities about her life. Making these matters public allows people to focus on the trivial rather than expending their energy on something more useful.
Lindsay Lohan has had a past that is undoubtedly widely covered by the media. It is also a past that people have widely analyzed. Whether she decides to direct her path toward her Disney hey-day is not up to anyone, nor is it anyone’s business.
But if she were to make another film with the same brilliance as Mean Girls, that would be so fetch.

Seven years after the record-breaking run of its predecessor, 300: Rise of An Empire still managed a robust opening of $45.04M over the weekend, beating out DreamWorks Animation’s Mr. Peabody & Sherman. While this is a step down from 300’s $70.88M opening in 2007, which at the time was the largest spring opening ever, it’s one of the better weekends for a March action film, beating out last year’s G.I. Joe: Retaliation ($40.5M) and 2012’s Wrath of the Titans ($33.5M).
The original 300 did so well because it tells the original underdog story: the tale of the 300 Spartans facing the largest army of the ancient world. It’s a story that has been told for thousands of years because it’s understandable and compelling.
Beyond the historical significance of the battle, the hyper-stylized look was distinctive and revolutionary for the time. Nearly every period action film since has copied the look and Zack Snyder has made a career out of the hyper-kinetic slo-mo aesthetic.
The film had a difficult sale (how can you make a sequel without the 300 Spartans?), so the marketing promised more of the same, with events taking place prior to, during, and after the battle of the first film. The battle took the combat to different settings, with a centerpiece on the naval battle. It lacked a premise as straightforward and compelling as the first film,however, and it also lacked a hook (nothing on the level of “THIS … IS … SPARTA!”).
The large opening can be seen as a testament to the goodwill of the first film and the fact that the market hasn’t had a blockbuster action film yet this year. It’s likely to do especially well overseas, opening to a great $87.8M in international markets, pacing nearly 20 percent ahead of the first 300.
In second place was the latest film by DreamWorks Animation, Mr. Peabody & Sherman, which opened to a modest $32.2M. Featuring the duo of Mr. Peabody, a hyper-intelligent dog, and Sherman, his adopted boy, traveling through time with the WABAC machine to prevent a space-time catastrophe, the opening is a marked decrease from previous DreamWorks’ March releases (last year’s The Croods opened to $43.64M) and is only slightly better than past disappointments Rise of the Guardians ($23.77M) and Turbo ($21.31M).
Having acquired Classic Media, which owns the rights to a vast amount of characters ranging from Felix the Cat, Betty Boop, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Gumby and the Rankin-Bass Christmas characters, it’s interesting that DreamWorks decided to adapt these characters first. While they were memorable, Mr. Peabody and Sherman were always supporting characters to Rocky and Bullwinkle, and weren’t deep by any means. In fact, Mr. Peabody was somewhat of a jerk in the original shorts, so the new film had to revamp the relationship between the characters to create a more sympathetic father-son dynamic.
However, the film’s marketing didn’t try to emphasize that aspect of the characters, or the shenanigans of time travel, instead trying to hype up Mr. Peabody. Nearly all of the posters and marketing featured Mr. Peabody, but the fatal flaw seems to be that even those who can remember the shorts weren’t told why it was worth going to see this character from a new perspective in a feature-length film.
It also had the misfortune of following two massive animated blockbusters: Frozen, which is nearing closer to $400M each week, and The Lego Movie, which is slowing down, having finished at $11M for the weekend and now stands at $224.97M. It’s likely to have good legs, though; it’ll have family demographic to itself for the entire month of March before Blue Sky Studios’ Rio 2 is released in April.

Now that you’ve got your first and third basemen lined up after last week’s discussion of corner infielders, we’ll continue with the heart of the defense: the second basemen and shortstops. 
Second Basemen
The crop of second basemen this year, as usual, leaves a lot to be desired in terms of depth.  This season, however, even the guys at top are problematic, with Robinson Cano exchanging RBI, runs scored, and home run potential for $240 million, Ian Kinsler leaving the hitting haven of the Texas Rangers and Jason Kipnis’ newfound ability to be overrated because there’s no one else and at least he’s young right? Newcomer Matt Carpenter is your rock at the position — as long as he doesn’t move to third base to make room for Cardinals prospect Kolten Wong — and Dustin Pedroia is a solid option in points leagues, but this is a position you should save your money on because they’re all one in the same. Take a flier on these guys and hope they become the next breakout star.

The former Blue Jay has been a forgotten man since his days up north mostly due to injury and a statistical anomaly in his 2011 season. He came into the league with Toronto in 2005 and amassed 28 home runs across four seasons total, maxing out with 17 in 2007. Then out of nowhere in ’09, he injected new life into his career with 36 home runs. After following that up with 26, he baffled the world hitting just 8 in 2011. He managed a repeat performance of 26 in 2012 before missing half the season in 2013. You won’t find slugging potential like this out of anyone at second this side of Dan Uggla, so enjoy.
2) Jedd Gyorko, San Diego Padres
If Gyorko was playing for a team with a ballpark with anywhere close to normal dimensions, he would be on everyone’s sleeper list. But he plays in spacious Petco Park, leaving him off of most fantasy teams. The Padres’ top prospect hit 15 of his 23 home runs after the All-Star Break, which would put him around 35 for the season, if those numbers hold up for the entire season. That said, there’s a good chance that those statistics were indicative of an extended hot streak and we might see a bit of regression to the mean, similar to teammate Chase Headley. Even with the expected regression, Gyorko still represents a bargain at a hitting-deprived position, and a worthy choice for your experiment at second base. If he hits even the same 23 he hit last year, his average will improve by virtue of him logging more at-bats in the major leagues and having the game slow down for him.
3) Anthony Rendon, Washington Nationals
Even though he’s number three on my list because I’m going in order of projected draft position, he’d be at the top of the list for predicted production and he’s number one in my heart after I drafted him last week in my main fantasy league. Unlike most of my previous picks, Rendon lacks that mammoth power that proves to be crucial in categories leagues. On the other hand, he balances that with great gap power, as his calling is sending line drives all over the field for doubles. The rookie is a bit like Dustin Pedroia in the sense that you won’t understand why exactly he’s so good without being able to hit for power or steal bases, but you’ll just live with it. And live happily.
Shortstops
Normally the most shallow position in all of baseball, I really like this year’s group of shortstops because it seems like you either have to be injury-prone, overrated or an underachieving, steals-only prospect to play it. This is by far the most important position to bite the bullet with your cash/high draft pick and get either Troy Tulowitzki or Hanley Ramirez because they are heads and shoulders better than the rest – feel free to add José Reyes if you’re in a points league.
Yes, Tulowitzki, Ramirez and Reyes have had as much success staying healthy as Leonardo DiCaprio has had winning an Oscar. If they do get injured, you can just look at the free agent list, pick up the guy with the most steals, and congratulations, you’re still no further behind the rest of your league-mates. Still, I signed up three sleepers, so like the talent at this position past the top 3, here goes nothing.
1) Asdrúbal Cabrera, Cleveland Indians
The man in the middle for the Indians had an incredibly rough year at the dish, hitting only .242 for the year. But if you’re like me, and take a look at the sabermetric numbers, specifically batting average on balls in play, you’ll see that Cabrera was extremely unlucky for an unusually long period of time and that the man is due for a bounceback. People will discount this, citing his 25 home runs in 2011 and the ensuing drop-off in 2012 and claim it’s just him on a downward career arc, which you’ll love to hear because Cabrera is in his prime at 28 years old. He should get you a .280 average with 15-20 home runs and at least 10 stolen bases, which is a nice find as the 15th rated shortstop on ESPN.
2) Jed Lowrie, Oakland Athletics
The journeyman middle infielder was a sleeper for me last year, as he is every year that he doesn’t get injured, and sort of made me look smart in the process. But I wasn’t totally sold on his 2013 campaign. In the previous few seasons, Lowrie averaged 30 home runs if he had played a full season’s worth of games. Therefore it was a surprise to see him only hit 15 when he actually played the first full season of his career. Though disappointing in the power department, he attempted to offset this by raising his batting average more than 50 points higher than his career norm to that point. If he can maintain his average, or keep it anywhere relatively close, resurface the power, and stay healthy for the entire season, we may have unearthed a little gem.
3) Javier Baez, Chicago Cubs
I’m so disillusioned by the depth at the shortstop position this year that I’m nominating a guy that’s not even on ESPN’s list of top 40 shortstops. One of the many prizes from the Cubs’ budding youth movement, Baez has some of the best power across the minor league landscape, making this more of “keep an eye out” than “go out and draft him” advice. He probably won’t be making an appearance for a while, considering the Cubs signed incumbent SS Starlin Castro to a long-term deal last season. But if Baez plays well enough, he could force his way onto the roster. Rumor has it Castro might be moved to the outfield so Baez can have his takeover. This we can only hope – he could be the position’s savior.

The USC’s women’s basketball team took fate into its own hands Sunday night and earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2006 after clinching the Pac-12 Tournament title against No. 3-seeded Oregon State, 71-62.
This victory was the team’s first ever Pac-12 conference title and was just its second appearance in the title game since the conference expanded to 12 teams. USC set another record in becoming the first team to win four games in four days en route to the championship. The team last won the conference tournament, when it was still the Pac-10, in 1994.
In just one season, head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke has turned around the dynamic of a program that only won 11 games last season, doubling the team’s win total to 22.
“I will not allow these women to underachieve,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I said it right from the beginning. I love this university, this basketball program and these players…We have worked on our toughness. We worked on coming together as a unit. I’m proud to be the head coach of these women on a mission. That is what I wanted to bring here.”
Cooper-Dyke’s words reflect her team’s play throughout the whole tournament, especially the spirit they showed in upsetting top-seeded and No. 4-ranked Stanford, 71-68, in the semifinals, shocking the Cardinal and the rest of the nation and indicating USC’s ascendance back into prominence in women’s basketball.
The upset led to the first time that Stanford wasn’t a part of the conference title game since the tournament’s employment in 2002.
USC’s momentum undoubtedly carried over from that big win, especially on defense, forcing four Oregon State turnovers on the team’s first six possessions.
The Women of Troy were led by the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player in junior guard Ariya Crook, who finished the game with 16 points. The Los Angeles native scored 63 total points over the course of the tournament and became the first USC women’s basketball player to be named Pac-12 Tournament MOP.
Senior forward Cassie Harberts, who carried the team in the final minutes of the Stanford game with 10 consecutive points, finished off her Pac-12 career with a 12-point game. Harberts was named to the All-Tournament team for the second time in her USC career.
“We’ve been through injuries, saying we are going to the tournament and then coming up short for the past few years,” Harberts said. “I felt a difference in this team. That we wanted it and we were going to do whatever we had to do to get it. I’m so proud of them.”
Junior guard Kiki Alofaituli added 15 points, while sophomore guard Brianna Barrett posted 11, putting four players in double figures for the Women of Troy.
It was another great game from behind the arc for USC, who shot nearly 60 percent from three-point land (7-for-12). The Women of Troy also made 20 of 24 free throws, good enough for 83 percent.
The Beavers would lead 36-29 at halftime, but USC brought back the defense that carried them all season long, including a press, to stump the Beavers in the closing minutes of the game.
“I thought the press was the difference in the game,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I thought we were slow and lethargic and really played Oregon State’s pace in the first half. Mentally we were trying to figure out if we had enough energy to finish this thing out.”
Oregon State would go almost nine minutes without a basket between the 11:53 and 3:03 mark, which put the Women of Troy on top by double digits as the game went into its final minutes.
The Beavers would get to within five points of USC, but Harberts made a basket with 1:17 left to fend off their late run and would the Women of Troy hit their free throws to hold on.
Oregon State’s Devon Hunter and Sidney Wiese ended up with 19 and 17 points, respectively.
The field of 64 will be announced next Monday, March 17 and the tournament will kick off across the country beginning on March 22.
