Summer is the perfect time for a new range of musical experiences. From festivals to a plethora of new album releases, the music world expands to new heights as the heat rolls in. We all know the classic summer hits from this year such as Diplo and Major Lazer’s “Lean On” and David Guetta ft. Nicki Minaj’s “Hey Mama,” but there were definitely some standout new tracks worth listening to that might not have hit the top charts.
The electronic scene brought vibrant tracks to the radio stations, many of which were only heard if you frequented the festival scene. A perfect top-down summer jam was Alesso ft. Roy English’s “Cool.” This song is the epitome of a Californian dream playlist. Embodying cool beach nights with friends, this song’s punchy beat and stellar vocals make it a must listen coming into fall. 
Newcomer Madison Beer was featured on a Mako song called “I Won’t Let You Walk Away.” This song tore up the EDM stations as a summer favorite in the electronic-pop world. Beer’s lyrics paint the perfect summer love story along with an upbeat synth-filled chorus perfect for a road trip playlist.
If girl-power pop music is more your style, Britney Spears and Iggy Azalea teamed up for “Pretty Girls.” The song, though somewhat sugar-pop, proves itself as a catchy and slightly empowering anthem. The lyrics follow a club-style theme, and the beat is fairly basic but somehow still stays in your head. 
For the funky bunch music crowd, this summer brought the heat with artists such as Unknown Mortal Orchestra with their hit “Can’t Keep Checking My Phone.” A vintage Tame-Impala-style track brings out the chill summer nights vibe that would still transition perfectly into fall. Electric guitars with a vintage sound will never get old — especially on this track.
American Idol alumni Adam Lambert came out of a long period of hiatus with an incredible summer hit called “Ghost Town.” There was a reason he made it so far in the competition many years ago with his killer rock-inspired vocals. This club style mix brings the perfect amount of electro-pop mixed perfectly with a rock influence in typical Adam Lambert diva style. 
No matter what stations you listened to or what festivals you attended, this summer offered an unending amount of new music. From electro to pop to indie-funk, the music you missed this summer might just have become your new grooves for this fall.

The School of Social Work announced on Sept. 9 that it will begin housing the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement.
The center works to increase awareness of the role that schools can play in helping students cope during times of crisis, according to the School of Social Work.
The NCSCB is known for giving educators, agencies and organizations resources to help with crisis management in vulnerable populations.
The organization aims to emphasize the role schools can play when critical situations occur and collaborates with various organizations and agencies to improve upon this goal and to function as a source for information, training resources, consultation and technical support.
The center’s relocation to USC will give it access to the School of Social Work’s experience with school-based social work as well as its reputation, research facilities and faculty,
“We believe the addition of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement will help us make even more important and far-reaching contributions to better prepare schools to provide grieving students the support and care they need,” Marilyn Flynn, dean of the School of Social Work, said in a statement.
The National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement was initially founded by David Schonfeld. Schonfeld is a professor of practice at the School of Social Work and is director of the center.
“Together, this partnership will allow to us to collectively build on efforts to help schools meet the needs of children and staff at times of crisis and loss,” Schonfeld said in the release.
Schonfeld is also active in the American Academy of Pediatrics Disaster Preparedness Advisory Council and the Sandy Hook Advisory Commission and the National Commission on Children and Disasters. He also supervises the Coalition to Support Grieving Students.
The center started with funding from the Sept. 11 Children’s Fund and the National Philanthropic Trust. The center currently has support from the New York Life Foundation, which gives the center the ability to provide services to educators in school-based settings.

Business leaders of Fortune 100 and Fortune 1000 companies convened in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Friday to network and discuss industry practices during the third annual Global Supply Chain Excellence Summit hosted by the Marshall Center for Global Supply Chain Management.
Nick Vyas, director of the Center for Global Supply Chain Management, said that this event was the summation of his vision for what he wanted to accomplish when he initially created the center.
“When I cofounded the Center for Excellence at the Marshall School of Business [of which the Center for Global Supply Chain Management is a subsidiary], the goal was to have multi-pronged strategy to engage industry with our school, give students the opportunity to engage with industry, as well as create the brand awareness in the global supply chain community by creating this research and network opportunity,” Vyas said.
The event featured many concurrently running lectures held around the Campus Center that featured both members of Fortune 500 companies and USC staff as speakers and panelists. Panels covered a wide variety of topics such as the future of digital distribution, healthcare, manufacturing and technological innovations. Chris Kearns, vice president of key account management and sales  for Taylored Services, was particularly impressed by the diversity of the panels.
“[The panels have been] very diverse. It’s been hard to choose which forum to attend. So the diversity has been very well done, and it’s been a good opportunity to attend and have the type of choice that’s been presented at the summit,” Kearns said. “There’s a lot of great speakers, and it’s been something that’s just been educational for me and for us as a company.”
Blair Thoman, a sophomore and student volunteer studying arts, technology and the business of innovation, thought that the event was beneficial for the students in attendance.
“It’s really geared toward our students, both MBA’s and master’s of global supply chain management, and I think the really great thing about it is that it offers them face time with some really prominent people who have found success in the fields these students are interested in,” Blair said. “It’s a really great way to show the real world application of what they’re learning, as well as connecting them with people who could be really beneficial in furthering their careers later on.”
The event was primarily staffed and organized by student volunteers as well as corporate sponsors including Destination Luxury.
Chirag Sagar, COO of Destination Luxury, said his firm helped with preparation for the summit.
“We were hired by USC through the Global Supply Chain team to help coordinate their VIP reception and help them put together the event today. So we did a lot of their event planning,” Sagar said.
Sagar said he enjoyed being back at USC to network at the event.
“I went to USC, I’m a former Trojan, and I’m a big fan of operations. So for me it was meeting people, it was networking, and there are a lot of business development opportunities here.”
The level of volunteer support USC students provided was another aspect that impressed Kearns.
“The summit has been put together fantastically, and just looking at the type of volunteer support by the students at USC has been impressive as well,” Kearns said. “So it’s been pulled together in a very collaborative way and it’s been interesting to see that as well.”
Ryan Zhang, an MBA student graduating in 2016, felt that networking at the event was very beneficial for him as well as his classmates.
“It’s an amazing conference,” Zhang said. “Lots of professionals are gathering here from different cultural backgrounds, different industry backgrounds. It’s really amazing. My classmates that are here have already learned a lot from the professionals.”

USC’s award-winning service organization Kicks for Kids, dedicated to promoting a healthy lifestyle for children with special needs, held its Fall 2015 kickoff on Sunday.
Kicks for Kids organizes weekly soccer games on Sunday in McCarthy Quad for children with developmental disabilities. The kids come from all over the greater Los Angeles area and spend a few hours exercising together. Besides getting to know each other, they also get to build relationships with the many college students who volunteer there every week.
Kicks for Kids President Ariana Shives has been volunteering at the organization since her freshman year. She said she has enjoyed every moment because of the personal connections she has made.
“Kicks for Kids means the world to me,” Shives said. “It has taught me so much about life, about happiness and about what it means to love.”
The organization was first founded in March 2013 when alumnus Zade Shakir came up with the idea of celebrating children who are traditionally marginalized by organized sports. He was inspired after attending Spirits in Action, an annual event at USC that is modeled after the Special Olympics.
“At Spirits in Action, I got paired up with a young man named Erick, who is autistic,” Shakir said. “He was my buddy for the day, and he loved exercising, running around and playing soccer.”
Shakir later found out from Erick’s parents that Erick normally didn’t have a place to play soccer, so they really look forward to Spirits in Action every year.
“After hearing that, I realized how few opportunities there are for children with special needs. I wanted to provide a weekly outlet for kids like Erick to play in a welcoming and all-inclusive environment,” Shakir said.
Once the idea for Kicks for Kids was born, Shakir contacted local elementary schools and reached out to friends and like-minded, hard-working people to join his cause. Senior business administration major Zaki Khan was one of the people Shakir recruited onto his founding board, and he is now the organization’s vice president.
“One of my major responsibilities is external affairs, which involves keeping in contact with special guests,” Khan said. “Today, we actually have two Major League Soccer Players here: Todd Dunivant and A. J. DeLaGarza from the L.A. Galaxy.”
Fellow executive board member Austin Farres-Oriol, who is in charge of fundraising, explained that Kicks for Kids has been preparing programs like this since the summer and end of last year.
“Ever since last session, we’ve been getting ready. We want to have more special guests, more interactive scrimmages and more organized programs on each field for the kids,” Farres-Oriol said.
Since 2013, Kicks for Kids has grown tremendously, garnering more volunteers every year. Last year, the organization won the 2014-2015 USC Tommy Awards for Best Service/Volunteer Organization. E-board members are looking forward to another great season and hope to gain an even larger presence on campus.
“Our goal is to have a one-to-one ratio of student to child because we want to give as much attention to the kids as possible,” Khan said. “That’s why we want everyone at USC to know what Kicks for Kids is. The more volunteers we have, the better.”
Dean Davidson, a sophomore majoring in accounting, volunteered at Kicks for Kids the for the first time Sunday.
“I thought doing this on a Sunday morning instead of sleeping in was a much better use of my time,” he said.
Davidson said he was impressed with how the event was orchestrated.
“I really like it. It seems to be very well-organized, well-run and with tons of volunteers, so every little buddy has a big buddy,” Davidson said.
Juan Negrete, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development, also said that he was drawn to the organization because of his passion for youth development.
“It’s a really great event because it mixes a beautiful sport, soccer, with a beautiful community, the USC community,” Negrete said. “When you mix these two things together, you get something special that can even make an impact on a kid’s awareness about college.”
Khan hopes that soon, everyone at USC will know what Kicks for Kids is.
“One of the things we are working on is creating a more holistic student organization feel,” he said. “Previously, volunteers would just come and go. But we want to include them more by having career info sessions with the Occupational Therapy department paths and working on a partnership with Smiles Cafe so everyone can go there together after a game.”
Kicks for Kids has already expanded across California, and the program is now running chapters in both Los Angeles and San Jose. Anyone who wants to volunteer for Kicks for Kids can register online.

When I was younger, I distinctly remember the popular music community being in an uproar over lip-syncers like Britney Spears and Ashlee Simpson. Their acceptance in the music world created a crash and a category of “sellouts” — people who accepted their lack of talent and worked with it regardless of its effect on their own careers. It seemed that these artists were somewhat unaffected by the discovery of their egregious secrets and continued on to pop fame.
This was a principle that always thoroughly irritated me as I became more knowledgeable about the music industry. As an artist myself, I recognized the struggle of people who had significant talent and went unrecognized their whole lives because the media was solely consumed with false talent idols.
When I really started to understand and deepen my knowledge of the EDM world, I had a DJ friend of mine loosely mention “ghost producers.” He explained that several major artists in the EDM world passed off other productions as their own, claiming the rights and profits of the tracks.
Again, I was horrified. On one hand, I thoroughly understood the business side of it. It was a lucrative industry, paying up to $20,000 a track for talented wallflowers to produce a hit claimed by a well-known DJ. I also understood that there are instances in which large producers found tracks unknown to the public and capitalized on their potential.
Despite whatever backdoor agreements are being made between ghost producers and major DJs, there are several inherently wrong aspects, both financially and conditionally.
In the music industry, there is a very precarious hierarchy of management that collects and distributes the earned funds throughout the team. This includes all profits and royalties from a song’s success. Though a DJ may create a standard pay for a ghost producer, the success of the song and its royalties usually go toward the DJ who commissioned the work. The real artist rarely gets credit or an influx of profit post-production.
Not only is this decreasing the integrity of the industry, but it is also demoralizing the whole idea that producers in the EDM world are largely self-sufficient. This industry was one of the first of its kind to present a world of self-production. Many of these DJs are self-reliant. They produce, manage and market themselves, especially in the early stages of their careers. Moreover, many of these DJs belong to labels run by other DJs that, in turn, serve less as a platform for success and more as a world of solidarity and production collaboration.
Artists such as Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike have been rumored to be using ghost producers on various tracks, something the general public would have no idea about. When the listener is enjoying his or her favorite hit tracks, the listener assumes that the work is true to the artist.
This brings me to my second point, which makes me particularly angry: morality. There is a moral obligation, not only in real life practice but also in any sort of business to affirm credit to where it is deserved. Legally, it is unethical and considered plagiarism to credit anyone’s work and serve it as your own.
Despite the fact that companies deeply entrenched in the industry may have the fine print somewhere that these tracks were produced by someone else, the plagiarism is still legitimate since the general public is absolutely clueless.
Much like the lip-syncing pop princesses of the early ’90s, these ghost producers are a farce to the magic of the genre. Living in L.A., I have seen far too many local, smaller DJs work their entire lives self-promoting on social media, producing till 3 a.m. and working every gig possible in order to get their name out. These people work for the art. We can’t say the same about the major moneymakers using uncredited talent as a key to their easy money.
The modern music industry has been presented with unending challenges throughout its lifetime. Though EDM has been a genre in existence almost since the Cold War, its acceptance in mainstream industry practice has been a part of a new era. The same issues the industry has always had with artist credentials should be merely expanded and broadened in order to encapsulate an aspect of one of the most progressive and popular genres of music. We must recognize the necessity of keeping ethics in practice in the genre or industry. The future of EDM and its legitimacy as a genre depends on our rejection of ghost production.

Just steps away from old favorites including Bottega Louie and Sugarfish, B.S. Taqueria is nestled on West 7th Street in between salons and clothing stores. Casual and wildly colorful, The restaurant boasts a cozy atmosphere and curious ornaments that accentuate its eccentric dishes.
The first thing that catches the eye is the abundance of color. There are hot pink ceiling beams connected to warm, tangerine walls, punctuated with yellow frames. Molinillos hang from the ceiling. Then, patrons notice the wooden tables and benches lined with rainbow-colored pillows. It’s amazing how the restaurant managed to fit so much into such a small space without the environment feeling overwhelming.
The menu is straightforward, with starters, tacos, platos especiales, sides and dulces to choose from. There is also a fun cocktail and drink menu to complement the delectable tacos.
The bean dip — made with black beans, chicharron, cotija, cilantro and pico de gallo — is served with heirloom corn tortilla chips. This prelude makes for a satisfying prelude to a Mexican fiesta of flavors. At first bite, the starter has an unexpected smoky quality to it. The hard, crumbly cotija cheese adds a sprinkle of color and richness to the dish, while the chicharron, fried pork belly and rinds, is wonderfully tender and tangy. The pico de gallo, made with fresh tomato and jalapeño, gives the dish a fresh twist that keeps it from feeling too heavy. The tortilla chips, served in half-moon shapes, are just the right thickness to maintain the expected crispness while also making each bite hearty and balanced. The dip costs $9, a bit on the pricey side, but each delicious bite makes up for it.
Chef Ray Garcia says the clams and lardo tacos are served on organic blue corn tortillas supplied by Masienda, a little place in Mexico known for producing maize. The tortillas are freshly pressed in-house. The company only supplies three restaurants in the United States. The origin of the humble tortilla is already quite tasty, but the toppings, fresh manila clams and garlic chips, are what make each bite exciting. The first messy bite was heavenly — you get your teeth into the warm tortilla, and then the plump and juicy clams mix with the sharp salsa, with hints of fragrant garlic, paired with the flavors of the lardo. The textures and flavors worked extremely well with one another; nothing was over-seasoned, or overpowering. Though it costs patrons $14 for two tacos, the quality of the ingredients and the generous amount of clams gets you bang for your buck.
The chorizo and papas tacos were topped with smears of tangy, spicy chorizo over a layer of melted mozzarella, and also chunks of papas, which are Mexican-style potatoes that taste like seasoned wedges — finished off with a fine smattering of cotija cheese. This dish definitely used more traditional ingredients of Mexican cuisine and packed a punch of spiciness that was both delicious and very messy to eat. They were more filling than the clam and lardo tacos, due to the papas on it as well as the bean dip starting to register in the stomach. Two of the chorizo and papas tacos cost $9, and the whole meal, plus tax, cost around $40 for two.
B.S. Taqueria is a delightful place with friendly people, perfect for a casual bite Downtown with friends.

After another dominant victory over a nonconference foe, the USC Trojan football team has wrapped up the easy part of its schedule. After two games — both blowout wins — it’s hard to really tell how USC will fare against quality Pac-12 opponents.
So far, there are very few complaints about the team. Against Idaho, the offensive line and special teams performed better than they did in the season opener when they faced Arkansas State. The offensive line opened up gaping holes for all five of USC’s stellar running backs, and the Trojans also blocked an extra point.
At 2-0, the 2015 Trojans have done everything they are supposed to, which is a positive sign. There were no close calls against inferior opponents like Auburn and Notre Dame this past Saturday. Additionally, the team has yet to suffer any major injuries that would negatively affect the Trojans’ potential for the rest of the season. The most noteworthy aspect of the season thus far is that it has been entirely predictable, which is a breath of fresh air when it comes to USC football.
The highlight so far this season has been the tremendous play of the Trojans’ skill position players. Both JuJu Smith-Schuster and Adoree’ Jackson picked up right where they left off a season ago, with the dynamic duo leading the charge for the Trojans.
Smith-Schuster has further refined his route-running abilities, improving his dependability and admirably filling the shoes of departed first-round draft pick Nelson Agholor. Smith-Schuster brings a level of smash mouth physicality to the wideout position that makes him an even more formidable threat than former standouts Robert Woods, Marqise Lee and Agholor. Additionally, his speed and catch radius are already at an elite level and will give opposing Pac-12 defensive backs nightmares for the rest of the season.
If contending with Smith-Schuster and the rest of USC’s talented wide receivers wasn’t enough, now defenses have to worry about Jackson making a big play whenever he touches the ball, which so far has been much more frequent than last season. Jackson, who is also one of the surest tacklers on defense, had a catch-and-run that was about as close to Reggie Bush’s famous run against Fresno State as anything the Coliseum has seen in the last 10 years.
Both Smith-Schuster and Jackson have lived up to their billing as ballyhooed recruits, and USC’s potent and explosive offense is reaping the rewards. The talent extends beyond the receiving corps to the backfield where USC is absolutely loaded at tailback.
Junior Justin Davis made his 2015 debut in electrifying style, bouncing his first run outside and taking it to the goal line.  After scoring on the subsequent play, Davis’s uncanny vision and cutback ability was on display on the next drive with impressive runs. Though frequently injured, Davis has natural instincts that just can’t be taught, and if he can somehow stay healthy all season, the Trojans will have the perfect complement to Tre Madden’s running style.
Madden had another impressive game, displaying his versatility as a runner, pass-catcher and blocker. Though he has missed a lot of the last two seasons, Madden hasn’t really skipped a beat from his elite performances in the early 2013 season.
The real revelations, though, have been the freshmen trio of running backs. Ronald Jones II followed up his terrific debut with another stellar performance against the Vandals. In what was one of the most impressive runs of the game, Jones exploded through the middle for a dynamic 40-plus yard touchdown run. Though it was called back because of holding, this run, in conjunction with his long scamper against Arkansas State, is indicative of Jones’ tremendous big play ability.
While Jones has dominated the headlines so far, both Dominic Davis and Aca’Cedric Ware have also made quality impressions. Davis, who is too light to be an every-down back, makes explosive plays every time he touches the ball. With his ability to split out wide, Davis could be a matchup nightmare for opposing linebackers who can’t match his quickness. Ware has only flashed glimpses of his potential, but the brief introduction has exhibited a physical downhill runner who complements the quartet of USC’s other running backs.
It’s certainly too early to get overly excited about the Trojans’ postseason potential after only two wins against substandard opponents, but the team definitely has to feel good about their first two victories.
Both Stanford and Arizona State have looked suspect so far this season, and if the Trojans can somehow beat both the Cardinal and Sun Devils, then they will enter their early season bye in the best position they have been in since the end of the Pete Carroll era. The team has a long way to go to match the performance of those teams, but so far it is trending in the right direction.

Perhaps the only thing hotter than the current Los Angeles heat wave has been the play of Samantha Bricio and the women’s volleyball team. The No. 6-ranked Women of Troy tacked on four wins in just 12 combined sets to remain undefeated in the season and capture the 2015 USC Classic Crown on Friday night.
USC (10-0) stayed perfect throughout the year with sweeps of Utah State, Pepperdine, Idaho State and New Mexico in a span of just two days and, in the process, upped its streak to nine straight sweeps. The Women of Troy also won their 29th consecutive set and stayed perfect at the Galen Center this season, culminating with the 3-0 victory (25-23, 25-10, 25-20) against New Mexico on Friday evening.
Head coach Mick Haley was impressed with how his team handled the tough two-day playing schedule.
“It was very difficult, but I think our team met the challenge wonderfully, and their attitude about it was great,” Haley said. “Each game, they came out ready to get out there, compete, and they played hard.”
Against the Lobos, senior All-American outside hitter Samantha Bricio had yet another stellar performance, logging 21 kills on a scorching .487 hitting percentage to pace USC while also adding eight digs, two blocks and a service ace.
The successful tournament also moved Bricio up in USC’s career record books. In ninth place all-time in career kills heading into the USC Classic, Bricio jumped three former USC greats in Katie Haller (1990-93), Nancy Hillman (1985-88) and April Ross (2000-03)  to now sit at sixth all-time in program history with 1,586 career kills.
Another player who had a big night out on the pins was freshman Alyse Ford. The Laguna Beach, California native finished second on the team with a career-high 11 kills on a .321 hitting percentage, while adding four digs and a block.
With all the pressure that comes with being a freshman in the tough Pac-12 conference, Ford knows her contributions will be important for the team moving forward.
“As a freshman, I just try to do my part and try to contribute as much as I can,” Ford said. “There are definitely moments when I feel pressured, like when teams target me on serve receive, but I just try to stay in my zone and not let the pressure get the best of me.”
Furthermore, junior libero Taylor Whittingham  anchored a USC defense that held the Lobos to a mere .110 team hitting percentage. The Rancho Santa Margarita, California, native averaged 6.33 digs per set and logged a match-high 19 digs, her ninth match with double-digit digs.
Though her defense has certainly aided USC on its current winning streak, the veteran Whittingham knows her team has to take things day by day.
“It’s great, but we’re not really thinking about any streak; we’re just focused on one match at a time. It’s a completely different team from last year — we have a different energy and confidence about ourselves. If we can keep those two things up, I think we can be unstoppable,” Whittingham said.
By the end of the night, Bricio, Ford, and senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms were named to the all-tournament team, with Bricio earning MVP honors for the eighth time in her career.
USC began the tournament early Thursday morning with a match against Utah State. The Aggies, however, would prove to be no match for the high-powered USC offense, as the Women of Troy completed the 3-0 sweep (25-22, 25-9, 25-14). In the match, Bricio was feasting from behind the service line, tying her career-high and the USC single-match record with eight aces in just three sets.
That serving streak would continue on into the night, as Bricio added five more aces to help the Women of Troy defeat the Pepperdine Waves 3-0 (25-20, 25-15, 25-18) in their second match of the day. Bricio added a match-high 17 kills on a .394 hitting percentage to lead USC, while Whittingham contributed 16 digs and an ace.
The quick turnaround on Friday morning was no problem for the Women of Troy as they easily handled Idaho State (25-20, 25-22, 25-18). This time, it was Ogoms who led USC with seven kills and eight blocks at the net. Junior middle blocker Elise Ruddins  added eight kills and four blocks of her own, freshman defensive specialist Victoria Garrick  tallied 11 digs and an ace and junior setter Alice Pizzasegola dished out 19 assists to go with four digs.
It would be more of the same on Friday evening when the Lobos came to the Galen Center. New Mexico put up a fight throughout the night, but nothing could stop Bricio as USC earned its ninth straight sweep. To go along with Bricio and Ford’s 32 combined kills on the night, freshman setter Baylee Johnson  logged her third-career double-double and second of the day with 17 assists and 12 digs to dictate the USC offense. The win would improve USC’s series record to 6-1 all-time against New Mexico.
With four more victories added to the column, USC remains perfect at 10-0 on the season heading into the final week of non-conference play. The Women of Troy will now take a few days off to rest before they travel to Norman, Oklahoma, to take part in the Oklahoma Nike Invitational on Sept. 17-18.

The No. 6-ranked Trojans followed up their season opening rout with a 59-9 blowout over the visiting Idaho Vandals at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday night.
Led by an explosive offense that had big plays in both the passing and running game, the Trojans racked up over 700 yards of total offense. Redshirt senior Cody Kessler set a career high, throwing for 410 yards to go along with three touchdown passes. True sophomore JuJu Smith-Schuster set career highs in both yards and receptions, catching 10 passes for 192 yards and two long touchdowns.
“We came out with a good fire and jumped on them, which is what we should have done,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said.
The USC defense put together another solid performance, holding their second straight opponent to under 10 points. While the team didn’t force any turnovers, they forced Idaho into multiple three-and-outs.
The defense turned in a true team effort, with no one player standing out above the rest.
Freshman linebacker Cameron Smith led the team with six tackles, and junior linebacker Su’a Cravens contributed a sack. The team maintained solid coverage throughout the night, and made adjustments to thwart the middle screen that was giving them issues in the first half.
Offense was the real story of the evening, with the Trojans taking the opening kick and marching down the field 75 yards in just over two minutes, with junior running back Justin Davis punching the ball in for the first score.
That drive set the tone for the rest of the game, with the Trojans scoring seemingly at will against a beleaguered Idaho Vandal defense.
As a group, the Trojan tailbacks gave the Vandal defense headaches, repeatedly bursting for long runs that broke into the second level.
Both Davis and redshirt senior Tre Madden scored two touchdowns and supplied the Trojans with a bevy of long runs.
The USC running attack compiled 285 total yards, with seven backs running for more than 10 yards.
No single back rushed the ball more than eight times, demonstrating a wealth of talent at back.
Specifically, Madden and Davis had help from some younger players. Freshmen Ronald Jones II, Dominic Davis, and Aca’Cedric Ware all got into the game, putting up impressive yards per carry totals.
Jones had a 40-yard plus run for his second straight game, flashing glimpses of his big play potential. He led the team with eight rushes for 84 yards and was the topic of a lot of post-game conversation.
“He’s a unique guy,” Sarkisian said of Jones after the game.
The game featured a lot of young and new talent, as multiple newcomers continued to shine for the Trojans. The Trojans linebacking corps was buoyed by young talent, with Smith and fellow freshmen Porter Gustin and Osa Masina making an impact.
In the passing game, Kessler seemed to pick up right where he left off against Arkansas State, turning in another statistically impressive performance.
Kessler went 26 for 31 with 410 yards and three touchdowns, statistics that are sure to get him mentioned in any early season Heisman conversation.
His performance was highlighted by two deep ball touchdown throws to Smith-Schuster, who caught passes of 50 and 41 yards for scores.
“Cody told me, ‘Every time you go deep, I’m gonna put the ball near you. You got to go get it’,” Smith-Schuster said.
Kessler was able to distribute the ball effectively as 14 Trojans made receptions. One of those receptions was Adoree’ Jackson’s catch and run out of the backfield, which may have been the highlight of the evening.
Jackson caught the ball in motion and started running right before reversing field. After picking up a block from Kessler, Jackson cut back to the middle of the field and made a few more guys miss before being brought down for a 30-yard gain.
The play had the entire audience on its feet and harkened back to the days when former standout Reggie Bush was on the gridiron.
The Trojans are now done with the Sun Belt portion of their non-conference schedule, after winning the two games by a combined score of 114-15.
These early season blowout wins were highlighted by explosive plays on both sides of the ball and standout performances from a bevy of players.
After a couple of days off, the Trojans will then get back to work on the practice field as they prepare to host their first Pac-12 opponent, Stanford.
The increase in schedule rigor starts immediately as the Trojans dive right into Pac-12 play, facing two opponents who were both ranked to start the season.

Earlier this month, the University of Michigan announced that its class of 2019 would partake in a pilot program to curb excessive drinking. The program dictates that after two violations of the university’s alcohol policy, or one violation that requires medical attention or results in vandalization of public property, parents would be notified. Prior to this program, parents were notified of student alcohol consumption only in emergency health situations. Though this measure to reduce alcohol use might seem excessively strict, the University of Michigan is acting with the students’ best interests in mind amid reports of growing numbers of alcohol-related incidents among college students.
Any time restrictions are placed on alcohol, the concern is always that students will increase drinking in unsupervised zones. These unregulated areas include fraternity houses and house parties, where binge drinking and other dangerous behaviors tend to prevail. Though this mentality is a legitimate concern, this assumption is actually a logical fallacy.
In the past year, the university actually saw a 13 percent rise in the number of alcohol- and drug-related incidents. To combat this issue, the wellness department of the school — not the dean or public safety office — will call parents about violations. Mary Jo Desprez, wellness director at the University of Michigan, said to USA Today, “This is really designed to be about health and well-being. We know that anytime you can do early intervention is the best when you want to get someone back on track.”
The program does not infantilize students nor excessively punish them; rather, it allows effective communication between students, parents and university administrators to work together to reduce alcohol poisoning and binge drinking. Students’ safety is the utmost priority. And when the university contacts parents, it plans to emphasize, according to Desprez, “constructive, non-judgmental early intervention.”
Additional problems that can be facilitated by this wellness program stem from the problems associated with alcohol. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, sexual abuse, assault and failing classes commonly affect those who drink. Each year, 1,825 students die as a consequence of an alcohol-related injury. These examples can be avoided by unobtrusive interference from family members rather than invasive action by university officials.
Opponents of the program may point out that parent notification is not always productive. But since the university will notify parents on a case-by-case basis, it can determine when notifying parents would do more harm than good. Such discretion allows for maximum safety with both alcohol-related incidents and between parents and children.
Notorious for facilitating party culture, USC is not too different from the University of Michigan. And alcohol education — students may not-so-fondly remember taking AlcoholEdu seminars at the beginning of their freshman year — only goes so far to regulate student behavior. If the University of Michigan’s program works, it could set an example for universities around the country, including ours.

On a mission to prove that it is serious about changing collegiate party culture, the University of Michigan recently instituted a new pilot program — effective for the class of 2019 — in which parents will receive a notification from the school after students receive two or more alcohol violations. The policy equivalent of tattletaling, the new program babies college students and assumes that they are incapable of making smart decisions without parents issuing their stamp of disapproval.
Though effective at face value, the program warps incentives, suggesting that students’ strongest deterrence to drink safely comes from the fear of parents’ retaliation, not from a sense of responsibility that parents have hopefully instilled by now. And though the university has insisted that the intent of the policy is not disciplinary, the flurry of the administration’s phone calls to worried parents paints a picture that increasingly treats undergraduates as children who need to be put in their place. Parents, of course, should be part of an open and honest communication with students. But when the school, instead of the student, initiates the conversation, it becomes more punitive and less constructive.
By intervening in a child-parent relationship, university parent notification can only be productive if the relationship is already open and supportive — but some parents may have abusive or controlling relationships with their children. And though it is commendable that the policy will be implemented on a case-by-case basis, which means notification could depend on the nature of the child-parent relationship in question, there is no way for the university to have full information about the private relationships between students and parents. Depending on the student’s home situation, a letter entailing alcohol violations could put that student in potential danger.
If the university is so committed to opening an avenue of communication about alcohol violations, a letter from the school detailing a student’s violation should not be the first time that the school talks to parents about alcohol. Just as students take alcohol education programs, so too should parents learn about encouraging students to make smart decisions — before that alcohol violation occurs.
It is admirable that the University of Michigan will take this decisive step to seriously reducing alcohol-related injuries, alcohol poisoning and the educational decline that could accompany binge drinking. But it could pursue these goals without treating students like children — the university could advocate for stronger alcohol awareness, consent education and immediate counselor feedback if binge drinking begins to affect academics.
Regardless, all eyes will be on the University of Michigan’s class of 2019 to see the administration’s implementation of the new alcohol violation policy. It will most likely be highly effective — parental disappointment is, for many, the most biting form of disapproval. But it comes at the expense of dispossessing independence from students and failing to fully prepare them for the post-college social scenarios in which parents won’t be constantly notified about drinking. Students should grow up, and parents — trust that your kids have grown up.

A couple of years ago I would have laughed at this editorial. 
But with a daughter now well involved in her Junior year at USC, I’m completely agree. Sure it might be nice to hear what’s going on, but let’s be serious, I’m 2,000 miles away. I’m actually more interested in what the student has learned from such an incident and what THEY think they need to change in their behavior based on what they’ve hopefully learned. 
As I keep telling my daughter … I won’t always be with you to act as your guide/problem solver. College is about learning to think differently … not just academically, but personally as well.

Guys, have you ever wondered what message your clothes are sending to women? Ladies, have you ever wondered how to spot a certain “type” by what he is wearing? In case you’re struggling, here’s a few fashion choices that reveal a lot about a guy’s personality.
The bro-tank
This guy is a bro. He can be found manning the grill on game day. He likes to hear himself talk, so he will be actively participating in any conversation. You will say “yes” when he asks you out because his biceps are doing something for you. Be warned, at dinner he will order the meal with the most protein, and he will make a big ordeal about doing so. He’s nice but don’t bother texting him on a Sunday because he will probably be lifting.
The polo shirt
Hopefully you are open to long distance because this guy is likely from the East Coast. He is family oriented and is especially close to his mom. How do I know? His mom picked out that shirt. He is a gentleman and hopes to go into politics one day. Feel free to bring him home to meet your parents. Your dad will be impressed by his firm handshake and direct eye contact, but your mom may be concerned that her daughter is going for a guy with the personality of a 40-year-old man.
Running shoes
More specifically, the guy that wears running shoes to class. He spends most of his time in the library. When he picks you up for a date he will be at least five minutes early, and he will ring your doorbell instead of texting. He’s a good judge of character and is surrounded by a group of loyal friends. He may come off as a nervous type but you will perceive it as a cute quirk.
Man bun
Six months ago this guy would have been a misunderstood hipster. Thanks to Buzzfeed, this guy is no longer the object of your desire. It is easy to tell the O.G. man bun-ers apart from the trend followers. Here is how: The new age man bun-er is the guy that is late to most trends. He goes to Coachella every year, and FYF, and Nocturnal, and Hard: Day of The Dead, and just about any other music festival without knowing anyone on the lineup. He talks about entertainment news a week after it hits the stand. He’s always looking for the next best trend to follow and applies that mantra to his personal life.
The blazer
This guy is always looking professional. He even smells professional, thanks to the Axe body spray he carries in the water bottle pocket of his backpack.
He is one of the most social people you will ever meet. He will make you feel special by flooding your Facebook with event requests. Don’t be fooled! He plays the field well, and often.
Ladies, weigh the pros and cons for yourselves. And gentlemen, know that you are sending a message with each outfit you choose.

Going to college in Southern California, you’ll never have to worry about packing jackets and sweaters. Rebecca Katz | Daily Trojan.
Three months ago I watched my friends begin going through their closets, suddenly super stressed, meticulously trying to pick and choose the sweaters and jackets that they could manage to fit in their suitcases. I watched as their rooms started to fill with big, brown, paper boxes they had to ship across the country. I watched as they shopped online like lost puppies for big furry coats and North Face fleeces, not knowing which would keep them warm when it could randomly start to sleet in February, a concept so foreign to us Angelenos.
Being from California, right down to the heart of Los Angeles at that, there’s some odd, idealized romanticism about going “back East” for college.
I’ve heard it a million times — seniors in high school chatting with their college counselors about how yes, they’re from Los Angeles, but they’ve always felt they “belonged” on the East Coast. They can see themselves curling up with a good book and some hot cocoa as the snow begins to fall in December, catching the subway into the city after class with a chic new raincoat on, umbrella in hand, taking the new city and the new coast by storm.
I’m here to debunk this fantasy for you.
With half of my family living in the Big Apple, I’ve spent my fair share of time in the city that never sleeps. I’ve been through the hot muggy summers and the freezing cold winters.
Here’s what is really going to go down. You arrive in the armpit of New York or some weird suburb in Massachusetts at the end of August. You’re armed with a trunk full of cute new jackets and scarves to sport, but it’s 92 degrees and the humidity is off the charts. Every time you step outside your forehead is moist and sweaty. You quickly realize you can’t wear anything gray and you forgot your sunglasses back home.
But don’t fret you wild East Coasters, the horrid humidity and hot air only last for the first couple of months. Then you all experience that thing you were all so excited about. What is it called again? Oh right, “seasons.” A nice October and November of winds so strong you can’t feel your face and weather so shifty that you never know how many layers to wear. Then comes along the wonderful winter where some of you will be lucky enough to experience temperatures below zero, you can no longer get any type of iced drink from Starbucks and your butt is permanently frozen.
How’s that North Face fleece doing for you now?
For those of you who make it through the winter, well lucky you! You are rewarded with a warm, 36 degrees in March.
Whip out those tank tops and shorts everybody!!!
So for those of you that may already be thinking of transferring after reading this blog, or if you’re just ever so curious about what your West Coast counterparts are up to — just know that here at the University of Southern California it’s a sunny, 88 degrees, and it will probably be the same exact forecast three months from now.
We frequently enjoy sunbathing on McCarthy Quad after class, and every drawer in my closet contains flip-flops and shorts. We walk from class to class with sunglasses on our heads, sporting our perfect tans. We spend our weekends heading out to the beach, lounging by the pool or maybe just enjoying some California Pizza Kitchen, right here on campus. They call it livin’ the dream.
For those of you on the East Coast, hit me up in January when you realize you bought the wrong snow boots and your socks keep getting wet from the melted sleet on the ground and you don’t have any ear muffs. There’s a sofa in my room for you.
Don’t even get me started on the Midwest
So bleed orange, go blue, yay for Crimson?
But really, if you’re not from Los Angeles, and you have decided to attend this beautiful university, welcome to the best city in the world. We don’t make you walk anywhere, and we promise the temperature won’t go below 60 often. You made the right choice.
Fight on.

The No. 8-ranked Trojans followed up their season opening rout with a 59-9 blowout over the visiting Idaho Vandals at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday night.
Led by an explosive offense that had big plays in both the passing and running game, the Trojans racked up over 700 yards of total offense. Redshirt senior Cody Kessler set a career high, throwing for 410 yards to go along with three touchdown passes. True sophomore Juju Smith-Schuster set career highs in both yards and receptions, catching 10 passes for 192 yards and two long touchdowns.
“We came out with a good fire and jumped on them, which is what we should have done,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said.
The USC defense put together another solid performance, holding their second straight opponent to under 10 points. While the team didn’t force any turnovers, they forced Idaho into multiple three and outs.
The defense turned in an impressive team effort, with a bundle of players making impact plays throughout the night. Freshman linebacker Cameron Smith led the team with six tackles, and junior linebacker Su’a Cravens contributed a sack. The team maintained solid coverage throughout the night and made adjustments to thwart the middle screen that was giving them issues in the first half.
The USC offense was the real story of the evening, though, with the Trojans marching down the field 75 yards on their first passion in just over two minutes, with junior running back Justin Davis punching the ball in for the first score. That drive set the tone for the rest of the game, with the Trojans scoring seemingly at will against a beleaguered Idaho Vandal defense.
As a group, the Trojan tailbacks gave the Vandal defense headaches, repeatedly gashing Idaho for long runs that broke into the second level. Both Davis and redshirt senior Tre Madden scored two touchdowns and supplied the Trojans with a bevy of long runs.
The USC running attack compiled 285 total yards, with seven backs running for more than 10 yards. No single back rushed the ball more than eight times, demonstrating a wealth of talent at back.
Specifically, Madden and Davis had help from some younger players. Freshmen Ronald Jones II, Dominic Davis and Aca’Cedric Ware all got into the game, putting up impressive yards per carry totals.
Jones had an over 40 yard run for his second straight game, flashing glimpses of his big play potential. He led the team with eight rushes for 84 yards and was the topic of a lot of post-game conversation.
“He’s a unique guy,” Sarkisian said of Jones after the game.
The game featured a lot of young and new talent, as multiple newcomers continued to shine for the Trojans. The Trojans linebacking corps was buoyed by young talent, with Smith and fellow freshmen Porter Gustin and Osa Masina making an impact.
In the passing game, Kessler seemed to pick up right where he left off against Arkansas State, turning in another statistically eye popping performance. Kessler went 26 for 31 with 410 yards and three touchdowns, statistics that are sure to get him mentioned in any early season Heisman conversation.
His performance was highlighted by two deep ball touchdown throws to Smith-Schuster who caught passes of 50 and 41 yards for scores.
“Cody told me every time you go deep, I’m gonna put the ball near you … You got to go get it,” Smith-Schuster said.
Kessler was able to distribute the ball effectively as 14 different Trojans made receptions. One of those receptions was Adoree’ Jackson’s catch and run out of the backfield, which may have been the highlight of the evening.
Jackson caught the ball in motion and started running right before reversing field. After picking up a block from Kessler, Jackson cut back to the middle of the field and made a few more guys miss before being brought down for a 30 gain. The play had the entire Coliseum on their feet and harkened back to the days when former standout Reggie Bush was on the gridiron.
The Trojans are now done with the Sun Belt portion of their non-conference schedule, winning the two games by a combined score of 114-15. These early season blowout wins were highlighted by explosive plays on both sides of the ball and standout performances from a bevy of players.
After a couple of days off, the Trojans will then get back to work on the practice field as they prepare to host their first Pac-12 opponent, Stanford.
The increase in schedule rigor starts immediately as the Trojans dive right into Pac-12 play, facing two opponents who were both ranked to start the season.
