Pir Zia is the spiritual leader of Sufi Order International, a Sufi order. He is the son of Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan, and his father’s successor as leader of Sufi Order International. He is also the grandson of Hazrat Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan, the founder of the order. When he was young, he studied under the Dalai Lama while living in Dharamsala, India. Pir Zia was eventually appointed as his father’s spiritual successor in 2000 in a turban-tying ceremony in Delhi, India.
He also founded the Suluk Academy for Sufi Studies in upstate New York and the Seven Pillars House of Wisdom process.
“I think that this event is a great opportunity for USC students to be exposed to Sufism and the Seven Pillars House of Wisdom process,” said Ha-Rim Choi, a student worker at USC Spectrum and a sophomore majoring in business administration.
The Seven Pillars House of Wisdom is a process that is supposed to illuminate the experiences of life and facilitate a living wisdom that can help people address the urgent social and ecological needs of the times. It is also a collection of media and a community dedicated to cultivating the Seven Pillars House of Wisdom process.
“The Seven Pillars House of Wisdom is a network of people to harvest wisdom,” Pir Zia said.
During the presentation, Pir Zia spoke about each pillar in the Seven Pillars House of Wisdom Process, as well as the founding ideology behind the process. The Pillars, in ascending order, are The Journey of Life, The Living Universe, Our Sacred Heritage, The Great Mystery, The Cry, What May Be and The Pledge.
Throughout the event, Pir Zia elaborated on each of the pillars, and explained how the process of going through the pillars led to the cultivation of a living wisdom to address today’s problems.
Following Pir Zia’s presentation on the Seven Pillars House of Wisdom was a Q&A session with him. Pir Zia answered a wide variety of questions ranging from the relationship and symbiosis between religion and science to the failure and the importance of devotion.
Students who were familiar with Pir Zia and his work were excited to see him in person.
“[Pir Zia] coming here to USC is awesome,” said Jennifer Chen, a freshman majoring in fine arts with an emphasis in sculpture and design.
Others thought the presentation was a good opportunity to learn about different religions.
“Having a spiritual leader of a prominent religion come here to USC has really broadened my perspective,” said Eliot Kim, a freshman majoring in economics.

USC recently launched a new campus program, Trojan Guardian Scholars, to provide guidance to USC students who have previously been in foster care.

“We provide advice and guidance with regard to financial aid and academics, peer group support via a student organization, social events and assistance with campus life including housing options during breaks,” said Wendy B. Smith, clinical associate professor and associate dean for faculty development at the USC School of Social Work.
Smith and professor Jacquelyn McCroskey of the School of Social Work collaborated alongside Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Vice Dean for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives George Sanchez to found the program. Sanchez took on the responsibility of leading the TGS program and began to develop it through Dornsife.
“Foster youth currently graduate from college in very small numbers. It is our aim to increase those numbers,” Smith said.
McCroskey gave insight into why it could be harder for students who went through foster care to graduate.
“It is so difficult to do well in school when you are coping with family problems or moving back and forth between foster care placements,” McCroskey said.
There are 33 colleges and universities that are beginning guardian scholar programs on their campuses. Many schools in Southern California have similar campus programs: Guardian Scholars at UCLA, Guardian Scholars at California State University, Fullerton and Guardian Scholars at Pepperdine. Faculty at USC are excited that the university now has its own program.
“I’m delighted that USC will be providing additional support for our exceptional students who overcome the adversities of foster care to join the Trojan Family,” McCroskey said.
The Office of Financial Aid sends TGS informational emails to any student who has identified themselves on their FAFSA form as someone who has been in foster care. TGS is currently composed of nine undergraduate students. According to a recent USC News article, there are approximately 40 foster care students at USC.
Because of the sensitivity of the issue, there is a strong concern for  the privacy of the students in the TGS program.
“We have promised them that they do not have to reveal their backgrounds to be part of this group, but rather that it is a support mechanism for them at USC,” Sanchez said.
The program is designed to help support the members so they can successfully graduate from the university, as well as create a stable foundation they can rely on, Smith said.
“Beyond that, it benefits the Trojan Family and the USC community in general by raising awareness about foster care, being responsive to the needs of its community and demonstrating that USC is an educational institution that is welcoming and helpful to those who have been in foster care,” Smith said.
TGS is still in the process of becoming established. The program’s leaders are currently learning what types of assistance involved students want from the program. A volunteer program will also be integrated eventually.
“We do not currently have a program in place that matches volunteers with students. The student organization will be developing its own plan for volunteer involvement,” Smith said.
Many students have expressed interest in being involved in the upcoming program.
“This [would be] a great opportunity to give back to my community and help my fellow Trojans when they need help,” said Anna Rudakova, a sophomore majoring in international relations.
The TGS program wants to inspire students to remember that the Trojan family is always there for support.
“Our new Trojan Guardian Scholars program will make it just a little bit easier for them to succeed while they are here and, even more importantly, to help them use what they learn to make the world a better place after they graduate,” McCroskey said.

A USC study recently demonstrated that the regions of the brain most associated with empathizing with pain, as well as reward processing, are more activated when people witness hateful individuals in pain, as opposed to likeable people.
The study, which appeared in the journal Frontiers in Psychology this month, gives insight into the complexity of the human brain in relation to social emotions toward enemies as opposed to friends.
Lisa Aziz-Zadeh of the Brain and Creativity Institute at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, Glenn Fox, a doctoral candidate for neuroscience at USC and Mona Sobhani, a former USC graduate student and current postdoctoral researcher at Vanderbilt University collaborated on the study. The USC Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy funded the research.
In the experiment, Caucasian male Jewish participants became acquainted with stories about eight different people -— four of whom were hateful, anti-Semitic individuals and four of whom were tolerant, non-hateful individuals. Elements of these stories were designed based on documentaries and social psychology findings.
After gaining a deeper understanding of the background of each individual, participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging as they watched videos of both hateful and likeable individuals in pain. Results showed increased responses in reward processing, emotion regulation in the frontal regions and the “pain matrix,” a network of brain regions associated with experiences of physical pain.
The abstract of the paper suggests that the brain’s heightened activity might be in response to “the threat posed by witnessing the pain of a hateful individual more so than the desire to empathize with a likeable person’s pain.”
According to Fox, the pain is similar to one’s experience watching fictional pain on a telvesion show or a movie.
“We actually think it’s a lot like the process of watching a movie in which the villain is harmed,” Fox said. “At the end of the movie when things are really coming together, you really need to know just how hurt the villain is in order to predict his future behavior. You need to know, is this person going to retaliate? Is he going to be done for or is he going to strike out harder?”
Though the pain matrix is associated with feelings of empathy, the increased level of activity that has been observed might not be attributed to empathy so much as pain processing.
“We don’t think there’s much to do with empathy in this case,” Fox said. “We don’t think that there’s a need to empathize with the villain here. We think it arises more from the need to closely understand the pain of somebody quite frightening.”
The one prediction that the study confirmed was that reward processing was heightened when participants witnessed the suffering of hateful individuals. Combining the expected and the unexpected results, the study showed elevated activity in both the reward system and the pain matrix.
“What it shows is that the brain is really flexible in mapping how it processes other people’s pain and suffering. It shows that these circuits are working in a really interesting way,” Fox said. “At the level of the brain, how we feel about the person can also influence how we understand their pain.”
Michael Lee, a sophomore majoring in biochemistry, found the study’s results intriguing.
“If someone’s hurting you and you don’t like them, you’re still going to understand that they’re in pain,” Lee said, but he added that he didn’t expect that study participants would feel more awareness of pain for the villain.
Other students, however, disagreed. Stephanie Yi, a junior majoring in psychology, said that the study does make sense, but with conditions.
“I wouldn’t explain it as an empathic emotion. Rather, it seems to be more of a sympathetic urge. Everything is negatively connected instead of positive[ly]” she said. “This is more about surface-level emotions instead of deeper understanding.”
In the future, Fox said that studies will be focused on the emotion regulation aspect and how concentration, consciousness and cognition demands in general stimulate change in brain activity toward others’ pain.
Sobhani expressed optimism for future discoveries as well.
“As we compile [more] of these studies, we can start narrowing down what’s going on in the brain — how these networks are working together, what they work on, when, how much and so on,” she said. “Each study is one little piece of the puzzle. One day, it will be complete. What’s really great about bringing attention to the experiments that go on at the university is that … you never know who it’s going to inspire or what future studies will branch off from it.”

Last weekend, USC’s Dept. of Public Safety reported an unprecedented eight transports due to alcohol intoxication or injuries that resulted from intoxication, four of those which took place on or near The Row on Oct. 10 when the Trojan’s held their first ever Thursday night football game.
Both Interfraternity Council President Ofek Lavian and DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle noted that some of the incidents might be attributed to students tailgating on a Thursday night.
“People wonder what happened and what was so different about this gameday and I think a big part of that is that it was a Thursday game and campus was closed so people either had to tailgate right by the Coliseum or on The Row,” Lavian said.
Carlisle said the university had declared last Thursday an academic day and stipulated that there be no tailgating on campus or on The Row, but many students and alumni still made plans to tailgate at fraternity houses.
“I spoke with two recent graduates who were specifically going back to their fraternities to tailgate because they knew there was no tailgating on campus,” Carlisle said. “The fraternities had expressed to Ray Carlos [Assistant Director of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development] their concern that they might be able to control their current members but there was no guarantee [about alumni]. It was a valid concern that was played out that Thursday night.”
Lavian said that the fraternities tried to anticipate the possible traffic and spent several weeks preparing for the Thursday game. They consulted with DPS Deputy Chief John Adams and attempted to block off The Row to limit the possibility of buses and vehicles from the University of Arizona parking on the street and holding their own tailgates. They also tried to make sure that all tailgates were kept indoors and some houses put up fences in an attempt to control the number of visitors.
“At a certain point things got out of hand when there was just too much traffic on The Row and a lot of people were spilling into these parties,” Lavian said. “These were students from all different schools. There were students from [UC] Berkeley and [University of] Arizona, just a very, very high volume [of people] that we were not prepared for.”
One of the transports reported on Oct. 10 was a medical transport called in after a female Loyola Marymount University student was seriously injured falling off a table at a party at Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
“We have tailgates such as that every gameday and there are never incidents to the level in both volume and scale that we experienced this past gameday,” Lavian said. “The Row experienced a volume much higher than we had a capacity for, and I think that that’s why the weekend resulted the way that it did.”
After speaking with student leaders, Adams said he speculates that because campus was closed to tailgaters, and students knew they could not consume alcohol on campus on their way to the game, they were binge drinking at their houses prior to departure.
“Whenever you are consuming large amounts of alcohol, it tends to go into your system in a different fashion and that can create a situation where you may have to go to the hospital more so than in other situations,” Adams said.
Adams worked for the UCLA Department of Public Safety until this year and said that because the Rose Bowl, UCLA’s football stadium, is located in Pasadena, students tend to drink small amounts in their fraternity or sorority houses and tailgate at the stadium. Adams said that most alcohol transports as a result of tailgating at UCLA are separate from campus and the responsibility of the Pasadena Fire and Rescue Department.
“There’s an increase in social activity but it’s very minor and you don’t really see it because you see students get on the buses and that’s it,” Adams said. “It’s not like there’s a lot of loud music, and we didn’t get a lot of noise complaints.”
Still, Carlisle said the essence of USC’s gameday practices is unlikely to change.
“USC has a decades-old tradition of tailgating on campus and walking to the Coliseum,” he said.
As a member of the Pac-12 conference, USC is required to host a Thursday night game twice every three years and Lavian said he anticipates there will be another Thursday night game next year. He urged the university and The Row to alter their practices to provide people with more options for tailgating.
“I don’t know if it’s worth it for us to tailgate if it’s a Thursday night game again and face those consequences,” Lavian said. “I know that on regular gamedays — if it’s a Saturday or Sunday game -— we can handle our normal volume responsibly, but when the university closes down campus and forces people — alumni and people from different schools — to either choose the Coliseum or The Row, it creates a very high-risk situation, and I don’t think we can handle it. As it stands, a repeat of this year next year would be atrocious.”

The USC women’s volleyball team saw its 11-game winning streak come to a grinding halt Sunday afternoon in a rare sweep at the hands of the University of Arizona.
The Wildcats upended the No. 1-ranked Women of Troy 3-0 (27-25, 25-21, 25-21) and became the first opponent to out-hit USC all season. The loss was just the second of the season for the Women of Troy (17-2, 7-1 Pac-12) and their first since falling 3-1 to the University of San Diego on Sept. 13.
“I didn’t think we were mentally alert,” USC head coach Mick Haley said. “We had our chances to win our third set and just didn’t take advantage. We went ahead in the third set but we’re just not mentally tough enough right now to work through that situation.”
The USC offense was strong throughout the match, as three players — freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu, sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio and senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard — each recorded 11 kills. Though the Women of Troy posted a respectable .277 hitting percentage for the match, the defense failed to contain the Wildcats, who hit .324 on the strength of outside hitter Madi Kingdon’s 20 kills.
“It reminded me of the [Detroit] Tigers game yesterday when they gave up the grand slam,” Haley said, referencing MLB’s American League Championship Series. “Their hitters didn’t battle the pitchers. They just went all or none, like how we did Sunday.”
The opening set was one of the most contentious that USC had played all season, with a total of 15 ties throughout the set. USC went up 17-16 when junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer and junior outside hitter Emily Young combined for a block, but Arizona came back, pulling ahead 23-21. After holding off set point twice, USC faltered, surrendering consecutive points to drop the first set 27-25.
The second set saw much of the same, with numerous ties and lead changes bringing both teams to a 15-15 standstill. After a four-point run by Arizona, Nwanebu and Olgard registered back-to-back kills to put USC within contention at 23-21, but a Wildcat kill and a USC error concluded the set 25-21 for Arizona.
USC pushed hard to claim the third set and went up 8-3 early, but Arizona withstood the onslaught and applied some pressure of their own to tie it at 11 apiece. The Wildcats later went up 20-15 and never relented after that. Olgard knocked down a kill to pull USC to within three, but Kingdon put an official end to comeback hopes with her 20th kill to seal the set and match for Arizona.
In addition to the overall winning streak, the loss also snapped USC’s seven-game winning streak against Arizona. Despite the loss, Bricio tied defensive specialist Julie Mariani for fifth all-time in single-season service aces at USC (50), and senior libero Natalie Hagglund pushed ahead of UCLA libero Lainey Gera into eighth place in Pac-12 history with 2,017 digs.
Though the scoreboard will reflect the tight competition in each set, Haley was hard-pressed when asked to pull any positives from the loss.
“I don’t know if there are any bright spots that I can pull out,” Haley said. “I thought we got ourselves into a position that we haven’t been in and we had a chance to work ourselves out. But we weren’t successful this time, and now we at least know how to work on that in practice to accommodate that if it comes up again later.”
Haley, who has always been one to stress improvement regardless of the outcome, also emphasized the relevance of such a match to future postseason play.
“I think this will get us ready for the postseason,” Haley said. “We are going to use this as a learning tool and go through all the things that we weren’t able to do successfully. I thought Arizona played a great match today. They played very few mistakes and their hitters were excellent. We have to give them some credit.”
With their longest road trip of the season in the books, the Women of Troy will return to the Galen Center this week for matches against Washington and Washington State.
Last season, USC swept Washington State by a combined set score of 6-0. The Women of Troy split the season series with Washington, losing in Seattle but winning the match at home by a score of 3-2.
The loss to Arizona drops the Women of Troy to No. 4 in the NCAA rankings behind Texas, Penn State and Florida.

If anyone doubted the validity of Murphy’s law prior to the USC-Notre Dame game, then they must be certain of it now.
USC squandered chance after chance throughout its 14-10 loss to the Irish, with a multitude of self-inflicted wounds that included dropped passes, missed kicks and penalties (oh, the penalties). After 60 minutes of play, it was quite apparent that anything that could go wrong for the Trojans on Saturday most certainly did.
It appears such is simply the nature of USC football these days.
I imagine this is what the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions had in mind when it levied its sanctions on USC back in 2010 — a razor-thin Trojan roster struggling to find adequate depth at multiple positions while the team remains mired in the 5-8 stretch it currently finds itself in.
As USC limps its way back to Los Angeles this week to resume Pac-12 play, the length of its injury list is almost comical. Interim head coach Ed Orgeron has already ruled redshirt junior tight ends Xavier Grimble and Randall Telfer inactive for Saturday, as well as freshman running back Justin Davis.
That leaves the Trojans with just one scholarship tight end available — sophomore Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick, who has just one reception on the season. USC’s once-deep backfield has now shrunk to just three healthy tailbacks, with redshirt sophomore Tre Madden, the team’s leading rusher, listed as questionable for the Utah game.
At receiver, the cupboard is even barer. Junior wideout Marqise Lee was pulled from action against Notre Dame after re-aggravating his left knee sprain. With redshirt sophomore Victor Blackwell already out with an injury, the Trojans were left with three scholarship receivers available. On the team’s last-gasp effort to take the lead in the final minutes, walk-on redshirt freshman wide receiver Robby Kolanz was forced into action during the game’s most crucial waning moments.
USC finds itself in this desperate situation for several reasons. First and foremost are the sanctions, which have robbed the Trojans of anything even remotely close to resembling depth at virtually every position. The scholarship reduction was not meant to be a fast-acting punishment, but rather have a delayed effect, taking a few years to really take its toll on the program. That effect is currently being felt, though the clock has been sped up a bit thanks in large part to the collectively underwhelming performance of the Trojans’ 2011 recruiting class, the last year in which USC was able to sign a full-sized class.
The 2011 national signing day saw Lee, Madden and junior linebacker Lamar Dawson, three consistent contributors to varying degrees, sign with the Trojans, but many of the “big-ticket” signees have turned into downright busts.
Of USC’s top nine 2011 commits, as ranked by ESPN, two (running back Amir Carlisle and defensive lineman Christian Heyward) are no longer enrolled at the school. The rest of the bunch, except for Lee, are no more than reserve players.
Redshirt sophomore defensive linemen Antwaun Woods and Greg Townsend Jr. have yet to make a big impact on the defense. Blackwell has only recently started to see playing time in games, redshirt sophomore quarterback Max Wittek, ranked the No. 3 quarterback in the class of 2011, failed to win the starting job this season and redshirt sophomore offensive lineman Cyrus Hobbi appeared in several games last season but appeared overmatched at times, most notably in USC’s 21-14 loss to Stanford.
But by far, the most notable underachiever from the 2011 class has been junior wide receiver George Farmer. Out of high school, Farmer was the consensus No. 1-ranked receiver in the country and had garnered far more attention than Lee, his high school teammate. But a combination of playing behind Lee and former star wideout Robert Woods, coupled with debilitating injuries, including a torn ACL suffered before the 2013 season, has rendered Farmer a forgotten man, with only five receptions and no touchdowns in his career.
Other names on the list have also disappointed. Junior kicker Andre Heidari has struggled mightily since his standout freshman season in 2011. Junior offensive guard Aundrey Walker has been in and out of the starting lineup, and former tight end Junior Pomee- — ranked the No. 13 tight end in his class — was arrested and dismissed from the team before the 2013 season.
In total, USC signed 31 players from the class of 2011. The Trojans signed 31 players in 2012 and 2013 combined. Eight players from the 2011 class are no longer on the roster, which means each of the past three recruiting classes are either undersized or have underachieved badly.
Recruiting in college football is an inexact science of the highest degree. Peruse the ESPN Top 100 list from any year and you’ll find plenty of names at or near the top of the list that will leave you scratching your head.
The class of 2011 wasn’t the first year USC misfired with a recruiting class, and it certainly won’t be the last. The class as a whole, of course, does not deserve the lion’s share of the blame for the team’s recent struggles. It was simply just the worst time for USC to sign a bad class, given the impending sanctions that were about to take place.
It’s too early to give up on the 2011 class, or the rest of USC’s roster for that matter, altogether. As disappointing as the group has been, there is still time for players to revive their careers.
Until then, though, bad breaks and close losses will most likely await the Trojans in the near future.

This article finally provides a reader with the whole picture regarding names we typically see only in ones or twos.  But I like the way it ends…with the possibility of those 2011 guys playing up to snuff with big games coming up.  If that happens, then as sure as John McKay lives, that fat nurse waiting in the shadows of the Coliseum won’t sing.

USC’s women’s tennis team has achieved success across the board this fall. In each tournament, different players have stepped up, and this week was no different. In this week’s Intercollegiate Tennis Association Southwest Regional Championships, held in San Diego, Calif., newcomers Zoë Katz and Brynn Boren set the bar for the team, reaching the finals of the tournament.

Katz, a freshman from Los Angeles, and Boren, a senior who hails from Laguna Niguel, Calif., but played at Tennessee before transferring to USC this season, were seeded second in the tournament.
The duo, ranked No. 19 in the ITA preseason doubles poll, enjoyed a first-round bye before defeating teams from Hawai’i, UC Santa Barbara and Pepperdine with ease to land a spot in the semifinals. There, they were set to face off against their teammates, juniors Giuliana Olmos and Zoë Scandalis, who were forced to withdraw due to injury, earning Katz and Boren a spot in the finals.
In the championship match, Katz and Boren faced off against UCLA’s fourth-seeded Jennifer Brady and Catherine Harrison, who have been dominant this season. The Bruin pair most recently defeated Scandalis and Olmos in the ITA All-American Championship finals.
Brady and Anderson proved too powerful for the Women of Troy, defeating Katz and Boren 8-2 and handing them only their second loss in 10 matches together.
USC’s No. 1 doubles team of senior Kaitlyn Christian and junior Sabrina Santamaria saw their first action of the season in the tournament this weekend. The defending NCAA champions reached the semifinals of the tournament before falling to Brady and Harrison, 8-1. Though the score was one-sided, Santamaria was not at full strength, as she withdrew from her singles match the day before due to an injury.
Santamaria’s injury rendered her unable to match her achievement in last year’s regional tournament, where she reached the finals as the second seed.
On the rest of the singles side, Boren once again led the Women of Troy. She finished as the tournament’s runner-up, ultimately falling to UCLA’s Chanelle Van Nguyen, 6-1, 6-0, in the finals. Meanwhile, Katz defeated teammate Scandalis in the Round of 16 to advance to the quarterfinals, where she was defeated by UCLA’s Brady, 6-1, 6-1.
Sophomore Ellie Yates fell in a hard-fought match in the third round. Christian also bowed out in the third round, while Paige Keating, a sophomore who recently transferred from Ole Miss, was defeated in the second round.
The tournament demonstrated the depth of USC’s women’s tennis team and proved that USC and UCLA will be the biggest contenders in the Southwest this spring season.
Next up for the Women of Troy is the ITF Florence Open in Florence, S.C.

Following USC’s 14-10 loss to Notre Dame, interim head coach Ed Orgeron focused on the positives from the game, most notably his players’ effort, rather than the negatives. Orgeron has his team’s sights set on shoring up its self-inflicted mistakes as it prepares to play Utah on Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

“There were a lot of positives to come out of the game,” Orgeron said. “Guys fought really hard to give us a chance to win. Obviously, we have to eliminate the penalties that really put us back in some bad situations, especially towards the end of the game.”
Open Auditions
Junior kicker Andre Heidari continued to struggle against Notre Dame, missing twice in three attempts. For the season, Heidari is 6-for-11 in field goal attempts and just 2-for-7 in kicks 30 yards or longer. Because of his ineffectiveness, Orgeron has decided to open the kicking competition this week in practice.
“We need to make field goals,” Orgeron said. “We’re gonna open up the field goal kicking competition this week to see who’s the best one out there. Andre has done a lot of good things for us, but we’ll give somebody else a shot this week in practice.”
In 2011, Heidari was a semifinalist for the Lou Groza Award for the nation’s best kicker and was named first-team All-Pac-12 after making 15-of-17 field goal attempts. Last season, he dealt with injuries and made just 10-of-16 field goal attempts, but still made the 2012 All-Pac-12 honorable mention list.
Tough Up Front
The Trojans’ much-maligned offensive line played well at the onset of Saturday’s game, but wilted in the second half. Notre Dame’s top two defensive tackles, Louis Nix III and Stephon Tuitt, eventually wore down USC’s offensive line and made it difficult to open up running lanes.
“We struggled a little bit in the second half, especially in some crucial situations,” Orgeron said. “Tuitt is a really good player and he gave us some fits. We thought that we played pretty good against Nix inside, but in some crucial times, their defensive lines made some plays.”
USC finished the game with 129 rushing yards on 31 carries, good for 4.2 yards per carry. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler was sacked twice, and Notre Dame finished with seven tackles for loss.
Injuries Mounting
As if USC’s injury woes couldn’t get any worse, Orgeron had more bad news about his team’s health. Redshirt junior tight ends Randall Telfer and Xavier Grimble were ruled out for Saturday’s game, as well as freshman tailback Justin Davis.
“Randall and Xavier are gonna be out, I don’t know how long, but they’re not gonna be playing this week,” Orgeron said. “Davis will be out, and Marqise is questionable again. We have a lot of guys questionable.”
Gaining Confidence
Lost in the team’s overall poor play has been Kessler’s steady improvement throughout the season. Since taking over as the team’s full-time starter, Kessler has completed 61 percent of his passes with seven touchdowns and three interceptions. This has led to a renewed sense of confidence in the Trojans’ signal caller.
“I really like the way Cody’s playing,” Orgeron said. “He’s making plays, running the ball, making good decisions. He had that one interception [against Notre Dame], he’s had one turnover in two games. He’s really becoming a leader and has a lot of gumption. He has a lot of guys believing in him.”
Tough Challenge
Looking ahead to Utah, Orgeron noted the team’s strong performance in big games. The Utes notched their biggest win since joining the Pac-12 two weeks ago when they defeated Stanford 27-21. Utah has given USC fits each of the last two seasons, with the Trojans’ two wins coming by an average of just 9.5 points.
USC’s offensive line will likely be tested yet again against a very stout Utah front seven.
“[Utah is] a powerful team,” Orgeron said. “Good on the lines, very big offensive line, great running game. They gave Stanford problems, obviously. Their defense leads the Pac-12 in sacks. They get up for big games, and we know they’ll get up for us.”
For the Trojans, the focus is on regrouping after a tough loss and getting a much-needed conference victory to jump back into the race for the Pac-12 South crown.
“Here’s the deal: We told our guys this is game three of our new season. Utah is ahead, now we’re just gonna take it one game at a time. Be positive. Bounce back. Rely on the team — one heartbeat. Continue to move forward and fix the things that we did wrong.”

Technology can feel burdensome after a while, since smartphones and social media make it so that you’re unofficially on call 24/7 for your friends, family, peers and professors.
Cautionary tale · Randi Zuckerberg’s Dot. tells the story of a young girl who learns to live her life without being dependent on electronic devices. – Photo courtesy of Random House Publishing
Even Randi Zuckerberg, whose brother, Mark Zuckerberg is the founder of one of the largest social network enterprises in the world, agrees that we’re all getting a little too caught up in our devices. Zuckerberg recently wrote Dot., a children’s book about a tech-minded girl who learns to put down her tablet and enjoy the great outdoors.
It sounds like a charming story with a great lesson, considering  we live such wired lives. It isn’t uncommon to see parents using iPhones in place of pacifiers to calm their crying babies. Even cat owners find that their beloved felines can be easily amused by koi fish or mouse apps on their iPads.
Despite the seemingly feel-good nature of Dot., the book is rather a testament to how absurdly attached we are to our technology. To shed some light on this obsession, Time magazine and Qualcomm conducted a survey about our smartphone habits. For example, more than 80 percent of people ages 18 to 24 years old sleep with their smartphones next to them. And if you feel like you check your phone too often, at least you’re not alone — 20 percent of people check their phones every 10 minutes.
In July, Fast Company published a complete guide on how to “#Unplug” — in other words, how you can take a digital hiatus successfully. Like Dot., #Unplug is a yet another push toward slapping a Band-Aid on the deeper issue of tech hoarding.
Though the intentions behind the guide — to get people to reduce their overall digital consumption — are genuine, it generally sounds silly. Sure, you’ll miss a lot of emails, but a brief digital detox won’t dramatically change your life. It shouldn’t have to take a full-fledged guide to tell you how to put away your smartphone for a bit.
I, unfortunately, cannot attest to unplugging. For college students, email plays an essential role in just about all aspects of life, including classes, internships, organizations and more. A day without checking my inbox could mean missed opportunities or forgotten homework.
On the other hand, Paul Miller, a senior editor at The Verge, can relate.
Starting in May 2012, Miller took the challenge to live completely offline for a whole year while still getting paid as an editor. A year later, he wrote about his triumphs and tribulations in a long-form feature that went up on the publication’s website the day he was back on the Internet.
Predictably enough, Miller’s first few months offline allowed him to pay more attention to his friends and family, as well as pick up more than a few books to pass the time. As time went on, however, loneliness started to kick in — a result of his lack of access to any form of social media — and became his reason for appreciating the Internet again. The last line of his feature, in fact, reads: “But at least I’ll be connected.”
The tone Miller uses to describe his yearlong endeavor is more appropriate for accomplishing a feat like scaling Mount Everest. And it seems ridiculous, in a way, that Miller had so many highs and even more lows during this year without Internet.
And despite the fact that “unplugging” or “digitally detoxing” seem easy enough, we’ve become so used to having sources for Internet access that suddenly getting away from it could be unnerving and extremely isolating.
Miller was still able to work as an editor at The Verge and still managed to communicate with his team. By the end of the challenge, however, Miller was mentally worn out and emotionally zapped from not being able to communicate with his friends and family for such a long time.
Thirty or so years ago, relationships were built on in-person contact and by phone. Conversations took time and effort, and most likely made human interaction more meaningful.
These days, much of who we are is reflected on social networks. We communicate to each other through cat videos, Buzzfeed links and emoticons, not just through words. We celebrate push notifications because they serve to remind us that, in one way or another, we’re connected and we’re wanted.
The Internet is much more a part of our lives than we realize. Though these efforts to go without the Internet sound a bit ridiculous, it’s more difficult to do than it seems. As I write this column online on Google Docs, my phone starts buzzing away to signal incoming emails. It’s all starting to feel a little overwhelming, and I’m deciding whether or not to try unplugging for a bit. But a notification from Facebook pops up from a friend who published a link to a Tumblr post of cat GIFs.
Maybe I’ll unplug another day.

Located within Downtown Los Angeles’ historic corridor in the basement of an old bank, Peking Tavern, labeled a Chinese fusion gastropub, offers more pub than gastronomy. With a whole side of the bar dedicated to quality cold craft brews — totaling 18 taps — Peking Tavern also boasts a large selection of cocktails, including its in-house beverage, the BaiJu Cocktail. In terms of fare, Peking is not a chef-driven restaurant but has a menu with nine kinds of Chinese comfort food and Beijing street food.
Think of Peking as a Chinese tapas bar — a restaurant that serves an assortment of small dishes meant for sharing at a table with drinks and friends — without as many food options.
Gastropubs typically serve both high-end beer and high quality food. In that regard, Peking Tavern isn’t quite a gastropub. Peking can check the alcohol off of their list but needs some help in the food department. Appealing to an artsy crowd in its late 20s and mid-30s, Peking offers appetizer-sized dishes at a reasonable price, making its menu options equal or lesser to those of Chinese takeout, so it’s edible, just not incredibly delicious. Though Peking’s kitchen might be filled with Chinese cooks and pastry makers, the plates Peking has to offer lack traditional Chinese flavoring and presentation.
Original options such as their pumpkin shrimp dumplings might catch the eye of customers looking for something seasonal, but there is not anything special about a warm pumpkin and shrimp filling if there is not any sort of spice included.
Additionally on its menu, Peking offers a beef roll. The dish, which looked like a Chinese version of a burrito with a crispy wrapper of fried dough and tender beef inside, comes with a side rack of multiple Asian dipping sauces, such as hoisin and Sriracha. Despite the presence of these sauces, the overall flavor of the dish comes off as generic and bland.
The beef potstickers provide a gluten-free option and the three-salad combo concludes the vegetarian options for the menu.
According to an article by online food blog Eater LA, Peking has run out of food before 9 p.m. on a few occasions. Because of a $5 special that they had offered upon opening, and because of their wild hours, they are sure to gain publicity and thirsty customers into the wee hours of the night.
Aesthetically speaking, Peking is making the right decisions. Though the entrance consists of a nondescript door with the restaurant name on regular-sized office paper, Peking captures their patrons’ attention with bright red Chinese lanterns that decorate the glass stairwell leading down to the basement, where the Tavern is located. Upon entering through the archway that leads to the industrial and modern gastropub, a grand chalkboard covers the wall listing the beverages and fare available — recently, its special was hand-pulled noodles, but because there are not any explanations for the menu items, customers that might be new to Chinese food will have a hard time knowing what to expect.
On top of that, Peking lacks a solid clientele. Sure, its sole purpose for being in its location is to spice up the nightlife Downtown and offer a classy alternative to the usual bars in the surrounding areas. A nondescript door and a poor website that seems to have more warnings than menu options is not something that people will recognize and feel willing to check out, so in order to bring attention to themselves, some serious changes must be made. Granted, Peking Tavern has only been open for a week and a half, so they might have a little bit of time to fix their mistakes.
Peking Tavern is not an eatery meant for families or people under the legal  drinking age, but under the circumstances, Peking is a great place to meet friends and colleagues for an after-work drink and a snack.
Peking has everything it needs to become a high-quality Chinese sports bar. Co-owners Andrew Chiu and Andrew Wong not only created a comfortable, inviting space in order for people to enjoy, but together they share a passion for their cultures and bring a taste of their home in China to Los Angeles. In order to get more diners in the door, however, they must up the ante on portion sizes and create a larger menu assortment.
Peking Tavern will most likely be a popular addition to Downtown nightlife, but it will not be because of the food. Its variety of brews and cocktails will captivate any alcohol connoisseur, and Peking’s dining environment is fun and equipped with widescreen TVs to catch sporting events, including USC football. Taking the football team’s recent performance into consideration, Peking Tavern fits the bill: some snacks and lots of TVs for watching the game and plenty of beverage options to help Trojan fans kick back and reminisce about better times.

This article saddens me because Peking Tavern, which serves up fantastic food and drinks in a terrific space in DTLA, is getting the short end of the stick in the form of unpolished journalism.
The naive writer should have considered revising the statement that read that the beef roll “looked like a Chinese version of a burrito.”
The writer also stated that, “because of their wild hours, they are sure to gain publicity and thirsty customers into the wee hours of the night.”  Really? I’m pretty sure they are closed and not serving by 2am…
Also, my friends and I, in addition to many other members of the local downtown community make up a significant part of Peking Tavern’s clientele. We love the food, ambience, and service there. To say that Peking Tavern “lacks a solid clientele” is an insult, as we are one hell of a solid bunch.
I live near dtown LA and I’ve been to Peking Tavern quite a few times in the last two weeks. I’ve been sharing with friends and family this great local find. So far, each week they have been rolling out new drinks on their cocktail menu and new dishes on their menu. I’m not sure exactly what the author of this article has tried on their drink or food menu to give a seemingly unformed opinion. I had a great experience each time. I think Peking Tavern has provided a very authentic Bejing street food experience with a modern twist. 
They service at Peking Tavern was thoughtful and very good. I brought a girl friend on one of my visits who has soy allergies. I inquired and was quickly assured that there wasn’t anything on the menu that night that used any soy products. Many of my guests whom I brought aren’t familiar with Bejing street food but many of the menu items are very self explanatory and if any customer have questions, I’m sure the staff will find the answer.
So far I have tried most of all their menu items and can’t wait to go back for more, also to see what’s new. If anyone is curious, try the gluten-free dumplings are amazing!! Can’t get enough. I really like the fact that last week Peking Tavern had a new item on their menu, the Pumpkin & Shrimp Dumpling bringing a fall vegetable onto their menu. 
I hope the author of the article does go back after their soft opening to get more of a full experience and talk to the guys of Peking Tavern to have a more complete view of their concept.
If what “Peking Tavern” says is true, it’s quite alarming that the writer would make no effort to fact-check or reach out to the owners of this (or any) establishment. 
I had the pleasure of dining at Peking Tavern recently. They are still a “work in progress” when it comes to decor (they are still in their soft-opening period, after all) –they are NOT a “work in progress” when it comes to creating tantalizing dishes to please your tastebuds. Their dumplings put all others to shame and their innovative cocktails (complete with tongue-in-cheek names) are tasty and strong. Love the friendly service and their attentive manner! Their menu screams innovation and attention to quality ingredients. 
I could go on, but I’ve got a reservation to make. At Peking Tavern.
I live in San Francisco and often visit Downtown LA.  A couple of weeks ago, I sampled the menu at Peking Tavern and I thought the food was fantastic!  It’s true the menu doesn’t have a long list of options like sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, and six kinds of fried rice.  But I don’t think that is their intent.  It seems the author went to a different Peking Tavern, or maybe merely bench marking PT against Chinatown Express or Panda Express.  I’d encourage you to try PT for yourself and I’d bet you a dumpling that you’ll like this place.
Thank you for checking out Peking Tavern! While we kindly respect your opinions, it disappoints us that no one from the Daily Trojan staff attempted to interview or fact-check with either of the owners of Peking Tavern (who are both USC alumni active in the USC Alumni Association) before writing this review. We are not a fusion restaurant nor a Chinese sports bar, and we would encourage any readers to come visit Peking Tavern to learn more about our commitment to high-quality, authentic Beijing street food as we are still in our our soft opening and rolling out new dishes on our menu each week. Thank you.
Is this author even 21 to give a valid review of a gastropub? This review surprises me because my friends and I really like the food at Peking Tavern.

Real music often gets lost in an Auto-Tune abyss, where virtually any singer can be manipulated into poppy distortion. Auto-Tune is more frequently exploited by pop stars desperate to edge into the Top 40, but for a soulful, country-folk quartet in Brooklyn, the tool had another calling.
Family affair · The Gregory Brothers have enjoyed great success for its satirical, Auto-Tuned takes on clips from various television news outlets. The quirky group draws inspiration for its material from current events. – Photo courtesy of Gregory Brothers Press
The Gregory Brothers, composed of three brothers and the eldest’s wife, use Auto-Tune to warp a series of unsuspecting politicians and journalists, rendering its diatribes into catchy musical news segments that the band posts on YouTube.
The result is a far cry from its homegrown roots.
“You can hear us do all the background vocals and most of the back tracks are made digitally but that’s still making music,” said Andrew Gregory, the middle brother.
Though Auto-Tune plays a major role in its songs, the four play tambourine, cowbell, guitar, drums and electric keytar in its videos, and even transpose the instruments into the hands of its unintentional singers.
Its snappy lyrics incorporate modern slang (the group has called then-CBS news anchor Katie Couric “shawty” and “baby boo”) and comically inappropriate jokes that parody their subjects.
Much of the humor lies in its ability to unleash unfiltered jokes in a political news-media context.
Gregory attributes the group’s ability to be loose and candid to its platform.
“One of the really cool things about working on YouTube instead of TV is that you can just totally go wild with it,” Gregory said. “We are so lucky that YouTube came along when it did, because we’ve been able to be as wacky as we want because of it.”
The band traces its roots back to 2007, before the group became YouTube famous. The three Virginian Gregory brothers were joined by the oldest brother Evan’s wife-to-be Sarah on tour.
“Driving around the country for three months in an un-air-conditioned van in August and September is a real crucible, both literally and figuratively,” Gregory said. “We had such a good time doing it that it was pretty clear we were going to have a pretty good time doing whatever with each other.”
When the group first began parodying the news, a large percent of its job involved scouring news aggregators such as the Huffington Post and the Drudge Report for fodder.
“I would just never wish that fate upon anyone,” Gregory said. “I think both those websites are so trashy.”
Now the Gregory Brothers have faithful followers that rifle through news stories and pass along suggestions via Twitter and email. Though many of its fans are young YouTubers, the band has also caught the attention of a handful of politicos. Gregory said the group has fans in the White House, C-Span and the United Nations.
Part of the band’s appeal comes from the cast of zany characters they use in their videos, including the Angry Gorilla and Junkie Einstein, an “ultra-Libertarians” who suggest a variety of drugs that should be legalized.
The band develops the characters together and its creative process has become so integrated that it’s often difficult to determine which Gregory conceived which character. Usually, the weird creations are born out of donning a slew of assorted suits in their costume department and seeing which ones stick.
“I guess we’re just silly enough people that we had accrued a series of weird outfits from friends and family members through the years,” Gregory said.
And about the gorilla suit: “It was a gift from our granddad. He used to wear that around his neighborhood.”
Before 2010, the group had amassed a cult of followers but their fame soared when they edited a clip of a young man’s interview on a local news station in Huntsville, Ala., named the “Bed Intruder Song.” It now has more than 100 million hits on YouTube and became the first YouTube song to ever hit the Billboard charts.
The young man, Antoine Dodson, is just one of many familiar faces that have graced the Gregory Brothers’ videos.
Notable guests include Darren Criss of Glee, Joel Madden, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the king of Auto-tune himself, T-Pain.
“We’ve never twisted anybody’s arm or called anyone so we’re really lucky that there are cool people that are our fans that reach out to us,” Gregory said.
The Gregory Brothers love their fans, and Gregory credits the audience with providing a lot of the news material that winds up in their videos. The band doesn’t take itself too seriously, so it can be a little unnerving when fans do, Gregory said.
“Every once in a while we have fans that say to us, ‘I love Auto-Tune the News or Songify the News because that’s where I get my news from,’” Gregory said. “Whenever I hear that, I am terrified.”
The Gregory Brothers are currently touring colleges around the country, and Gregory said the performers are especially looking forward to its trip to Los Angeles.
“We’re really excited to be doing [a tour] at USC because you guys have such an amazing reputation for a good media studies program,” Gregory said.
The Gregory Brothers will perform at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Bovard Auditorium.

“I’m juggling too heavy a workload.”
“There are too few hours in a day.”
“My metabolism just isn’t fast enough to begin with.”
There are countless reasons to brush off that walk to the gym. Maria Kang’s response to those “reasons?”: A three-word question.
Alan Hung | Daily Trojan
 
The 32-year-old with a body of an Olympian started a cyberspace firestorm with a Facebook photo where she is kneeling in a sports bra and shorts, posing with her three young sons alongside the caption, “What’s your excuse?” Though many critics accuse her of “fat-shaming,” most miss Kang’s inspiring message. Rather than letting excuses and blame hold one back from achieving fitness goals — be it running a marathon or simply attain a healthier lifestyle — she’s saying, “Just go for it.” The first step to do that is recognizing excuses for what they are.
Some feel that her photo is insulting because it seems to suggest that all women can look like Kang if they just work hard enough. Morgan Moss, a family blogger at Theinklingsooflife.com addressed Kang, “You, as a woman, should be ashamed that you are furthering the downward spiral of how society views women, and how we women view ourselves … Most REAL moms don’t look like you, sweetheart.”
But that’s not Kang’s point at all. Kang’s point isn’t that women should look exactly like her. She doesn’t intend to brainwash girls into thinking that the perfect body is a 5-foot-3 inch frame, nor is it to declare size zero as the ideal size. Her point is not to shame mothers who have put off getting back into shape for years after giving birth either. Rather, Kang’s message is simpler and more constructive: It’s a wake-up call.
In a recent Facebook post, Kang issued an apology for having caused pain and provided a backstory to give the photo a richer context. Its origins, as it turns out, stem from goodwill. She had posted the photo to promote her free fitness classes and to say that there should be “no excuses not to follow through on your fitness action plan.” Life hasn’t always been easy for her either, which makes her photo more relatable. “I’m sorry you took an image and resonated with it in such a negative way. I … had an eating disorder, work full time owning two businesses, have no nanny, am not naturally skinny and do not work as a personal trainer,” Kang wrote.
For those who are fixated and offended by that photo, know that its aim is to help instead of hurt others. The response to that care is the heart of the matter. The idea of being fit is different for every individual, and there’s no excuse for people not to try to attain their fitness goals.
Whether a person is a size 6 or a size 16, giving up on health should not be an option. Janelle Hanchett of Renegademothering.com wrote, “Maria Kang, I hate you. But you’re right. And now I hate you more … I am currently 40 pounds overweight. Why? Because I use food for emotional comfort. Because I’m lazy. Because I put things before my health … I’m tired of my own excuses.”
Not every woman will look like Maria Kang even after four months of marathon training.
But women must recognize that Kang’s deeper message is one that can be applied to improve life. Women everywhere can feel their best by not letting excuses run their lives.

Hot momma…that’s all I got to say.
How can someone accuse another of fat-shaming when fat was not even mentioned in the pic? This is what happens in our hyper-sensitive society. People read way into a message, speech, writing, etc and then they same people get upset not by what the actual message states – but their own retarded, hyper-sensitive interpretation of it. The truth is we are all getting fatter – we know this and we all have a million reasons why our collective waist size keeps growing every year. I think it is great someone is trying to say we need to stop relying on excuses (because there always will be one available) and make a decision to live healthier. 
BTW – as a former chubby kid – I can say – having buddies around that will cajole you for your blubber is a great incentive to become involved in sports and exercise and not be the “fat guy”. We have now turned this into – hey go ahead and be fat and proud and be who you are – meanwhile your heart and arteries are about to explode.

On Sept. 19, the House of Representatives passed a bill cutting billions of dollars from America’s food stamp program. This measure now accompanies the equally illogical bill passed in July dedicating $8.9 billion — $1.5 billion more than was allotted in 2011 — to farm subsidies. These two bills are pieces of ignorant legislation that harm the poor and support the wealthy.
When farm subsidies first emerged in the 1930s, they seemed like a grand idea. The Great Depression hit rural America hard and farmers needed government support to stay afloat. But since then, the need for farm subsidies has decreased substantially. In fact, the entire concept is outdated. According to The Week, the average farmer had an income of  $87,289 in 2011, which was approximately 29 percent higher than the income of the average American.
Furthermore, some of those receiving subsidies are not farmers at all; many people are paid not to cultivate land that they own in other states, in an effort to keep food prices low. The Week also reported that approximately 75 percent of all farm subsidies go to the biggest 10 percent of farming companies, not to farmers themselves. These supposedly “necessary” farm subsidies have cost taxpayers $168 billion over the last 10 years.
In July, the House passed a bill allocating large sums of money to the farm subsidies program in spite of these realities. Yet when they discussed the issue of food stamps, a program that is usually passed in conjunction with farm subsidies, they concluded that food stamps have gotten out of hand.
Though the U.S. government spends approximately $80 billion a year on the food stamp program (more than eight times what the House is proposing to spend on farm subsidies), this is not because food stamp recipients are living lives of luxury. The average benefit  provided to one individual is $134 a month. This is just enough to help but not nearly enough to make a case that the program is being too generous. Furthermore, though the House insisted that unemployment rates have declined, the U.S. Census Bureau confirmed in a report released on Sept. 17 that approximately 47 million Americans are currently living in poverty. This is one of the highest rates of poverty in two decades.
The bill passed last Thursday would cut $40 billion from the food stamp program over the next ten years. The most recent data on the program confirms that 15.2 percent of Americans use food stamps. Under this legislation, however, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that 4 million people would be removed from the program next year, and three million more every year after that. The recent census report also showed that the program has prevented 4 million people from falling under the poverty line, and helped millions of others from declining even further.
The food stamp program is logical. There is no way to effectively refute that; it successfully supports millions in poverty. The new bill the House has passed is an insult to struggling Americans everywhere. It limits the time over which benefits can be received to three months, an aspect that the House Speaker John Boehner defended in a recent New York Times article.
“This bill makes getting Americans back to work a priority again for our nation’s welfare programs,” he said.
Unfortunately, limiting the amount of time one can receive benefits does not mean the recipient will miraculously find a job more easily.
The most frustrating part of this proposition is that the Congressional Budget Office states that if left on its own, the food stamps program should lose about 14 million recipients over the next 10 years just because of the improving economy. In other words, 30 percent of the recipients they now support would be cut. Essentially, there is no need to cut back on the food stamps program, because soon it will begin to cut back on itself.
In the end, the House became confused over which program deserves the funding. When they separated the bills containing the farm subsidies and food stamp program in July, they made a questionable coalition of bills into an absurd interpretation of what the American public needs.
This is the first time that the farm subsidies bill has been passed without the food stamp program since 1973. There is no need to suggest that farm lobbyists have a fair amount of power in Congress; that’s to be expected. Yet any reasonable person can see that the House is supporting the wrong program. Passed with the food stamp program, the logic of farm subsidies was irrational. Without the food stamp program, the support of farmers with subsidies is downright ridiculous.

I like the fact we have a program that can act like a food, emergency spare tire to be used in cases of emergencies. However, that good idea has been perverted by many liberals who are convinced there is a large segment of society that is too stupid to feed themselves unless their sanctimonious, liberal hands worked the plan so that many drive on spare tire donuts for all 4 wheels, all the time. And if those spare tires wear out – then the govt will give you new spare donuts next month. Food stamps became a lifestyle due to liberal pandering to the worst in human behavior.
Why is there a food stamp program? To boost prices of agriculture products. Why are there more than 120 federal poverty programs? Is not poverty a local issue? Is it not the responsibility of states and individuals per the 10th amendment? Why have we allowed this intrusion into our rights?
