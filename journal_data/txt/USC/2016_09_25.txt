I was born and raised in California. But despite this, I’ve spent a lot of my life receiving backhanded comments about being Asian. 
Since I don’t have a car at USC, I rely on Uber and Lyft to get me from place to place. I love the convenient price of UberPool and Lyft Line and the fact that I don’t have to find parking, but I am often fearful when I step into these cars because I am berated with offensive comments 60 percent of the time. 
Some comments I have gotten in the past year are: 
“Are you Filipino? You look like you are. You know, my wife is Filipino.” 
“How do you like America so far?”
“What English name do you go by?”
“Where are you really from?”
“Oh! My cousin married an Asian woman last year. Her last name is Chang. Do you know her?”
Yes, because I know everyone in the entire Chang dynasty. Most of these comments have been made by white males. It’s not that these comments leave me in tears, but it shows a lot about the way Asian women are viewed and treated. 
When I went to a writing conference for fiction in Connecticut this summer, my mom and I got off our flight at the Tweed New Haven airport and was greeted enthusiastically by a man we did not know. 
“Koni chi wa,” he said slowly, happily and a little too close to my face. Did he not know that we speak English? I didn’t think that these things actually happened, but they do. 
At the conference, I listened to a talk by author Robert McCann, and sat next to a guy who was taking a poetry workshop. We got coffee and bonded over the fact that we work at newspapers. He told me interesting stories about living in Florida, how his ex-girlfriend broke his heart, and recited his poetry to me without asking if I wanted to hear it. 
After listening to a bunch of pretentious words mushed together for about 15 minutes, I felt bad saying it was horrible because he was so excited and passionate to share. To my dismay, he continued and read more. 
After the coffee shop closed, he told me about his passion for anime and comic books. I cringed. Was I talking to one of those white guys with weird Asian fetishes? I decided not to be so judgmental and just continued to listen and ask questions. After all, I used to watch my fair share of Naruto back in middle school. 
He elaborated on his love for this specific anime character I never heard of and said I kind of looked like her. Then, he abruptly grabbed my face and tried to kiss me. I pulled away and said I had to go home.
When I got home, I called my friend to tell her what had happened. She didn’t share my frustration. Instead, she made it seem like getting male attention was hardly an issue and I was just overreacting about something that many women “would want.” 
I’m sure these disturbing instances don’t just happen to me, but to Asian girls everywhere. It might not seem like a really big deal, but this treatment is extremely problematic. It’s problematic to group all races together (Filipino, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese) as one race, to assume that they do not speak English and that they can fulfill your weird yellow fetish fantasies. Asian and Asian-American girls deal with this type of treatment on a daily basis. We are people, and it is time we were treated as such, instead of as objects of misconception, stereotype and fantasy.

[  Did he not know that we speak English? ]
maybe we should have some pride and stop speaking it, since speaking it does not earn you any respect.
“Then, he abruptly grabbed my face and tried to kiss me. I pulled away and said I had to go home.”-I would’ve called the cops if I was you. That’s sexual assault….unless you made up this part. 
Secondly,  yellow-fever white males think they’re doing you a favor by “fawning” you. But they just want to get in your pants because they believe Asian women are easy conquests. But it’s a two way street, because some of y’all play into that stereotype. Some Asian women think being with a white male is a social promotion, and it’s exacerbated by the stereotype that Asian male are beta males.

Fourteen women leaders in various professional industries came to speak at Bovard Auditorium for the 2016 USC Own It Summit, a women’s leadership convention, on Saturday. The conference featured speakers such as Pandora COO Sara Clemens, Time Motto founder Callie Schweitzer and former Twitter Vice President of Global Media Katie Jacobs Stanton, among others.
Over 450 students attended for the all-day event, which contained four panels and two breakout sessions from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. in various locations on campus.
“Own It was started to address the leadership gap,” said Riyana Chakraborty, a senior majoring in international relations, who also organized the conference. “Women are not filling positions at the same rate as men are, whether it be on corporate boards, in STEM fields or even as government representatives, which is why this event was started to promote female leadership.”
Some of the topics discussed in the speaker panels included ways for women to advance in the corporate world, the psychological block most women feel in fields dominated by men and how to get past underlying sexist stigmas. Panelists were encouraged to describe the processes they went through to get to their current job positions. Several speakers mentioned having to create new positions for themselves due to the scarcity of women in such roles.
“There’s never been a job or position I held that used to be held by someone else, simply because most of these high positions are held with male skills in mind,” said Elizabeth Brownsen, the Team One executive director of productions, operations and technology. “But I came to these roles by finding out what was needed and proposing it as my position — and thus made myself indispensable.”
Jacobs Stanton also believed in the importance of initiative when it came to women getting positions of power. She emphasized the power of sitting at the table — which to her means taking part in the action that usually only men participate in.
“I keep hearing so many women say that they got lucky, but that’s not true,” she said. “No, you don’t just get lucky — you make your luck and you earn your luck. You have to speak out for yourself; you have to sit at the table, not at the sidelines.”
As for advice the panelists had for young women just starting out, speakers agreed that maintaining a positive attitude and understanding oneself well are both important in the career world. 
Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Post Sales Monetization Tuula Rytilä commented on the topic.
“What is really important is self-awareness,” Rytilä said. “Personally, I feel that I learn the most when I’m making mistakes. So that self-awareness of knowing who you are and where you are career-wise is important.” 
Stanton added that though it is crucial to understand and be true to oneself, keeping an optimistic outlook is also essential for those starting out. Taking experience from her own professional career, she gave examples on why it’s important to be enthusiastic. 
“You have to have skill, but you also have to have an amazing attitude,” Stanton said. “As an executive, I can coach some skills, but I can’t coach passion. So think about your attitude and aptitude, and keep building those things.” 
Attending students expressed their enthusiasm for the event and for the speakers participating. While some came to see specific speakers, most attended the conference to gain surface-level knowledge on what it’s like to be a woman in various career fields. 
“It’s cool to see holistic females in the workplace,” said Laura Gouillon, a junior majoring in computer science. “It’s not as if they’re limited to their careers — they also have unique personalities and hobbies, which is inspiring especially for us as students.” 
For Jessica Tang, a junior majoring in neuroscience, the most important aspect of the event was its focus on women. Specifically, Tang stressed the significance of holding a career event tailored to females.
“In a world where it is a fact that men dominate most of the workforce that I aspire to go into, this event is an incredibly unique opportunity,” Tang said. “I’m really glad that this is offered here at USC.”

Photos courtesy of Paul SamahaAll about education · The U.S. Secretary of Education, fourth one from the left, met with USG senator Paul Samaha and six student leaders to discuss issues such as financial aid at Washington D.C. last Wednesday.
U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. met with Undergraduate Student Government Senator Paul Samaha, along with six other student leaders, last Wednesday in Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue of college affordability. 
Samaha was chosen for the meeting through the National Campus Leadership Council, a network of student leaders, based on his history of advocacy work for tuition relief and transparency at USC.
The Department of Education arranged the meeting to hear from students about their experiences with the financial aid process and obtain feedback on recent changes to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The 2017-2018 FAFSA will be released on Oct. 1, three months earlier than usual, simplifying the process by allowing families to use their earlier tax information rather than estimating their taxes. The change will also make families aware of their financial aid options earlier, allowing them to make more informed decisions about where to apply.
The meeting explored many issues, including financial aid for the middle class and King’s efforts to make the FAFSA more accessible to undocumented students.
“Clearly so many families fall into the gap that can’t attend college because they don’t qualify for aid, especially at USC, where tuition continues to go up around $2,000 every year,” Samaha said to King. “What can we as students do, and what can you do through the Department of Education to make middle-class education more accessible?”
According to Samaha, King said the Department needs to continue simplifying the FAFSA application process. The Secretary said he realized that while the upper class may have the financial and tax literacy needed to navigate a complex form, those skills are not as common among the middle and lower class. 
“We’re making progress, but we’ve got more to do,” King said. 
King said that the rising cost of tuition stems from states underinvesting in higher education. In response, Samaha challenged King to be more outspoken on the issue of tuition hikes. 
“While I know that you can’t control or put an end to tuition hikes on your end, your voice is powerful, and I would love for you to make a statement regarding increased tuition,” Samaha said to King. “Even though you can’t change USC’s tuition, your voice is powerful.” 
To prepare for the meeting, Samaha consulted with students in USG and reached out to other students through a Facebook post. Students told him about their experiences with the FAFSA not taking into account emergency hospital bills or decreasing aid for students who work over the summer to pay off their loans. Through his discussion with the Secretary, Samaha was able to bring those issues to King’s attention as well as learn from the experiences of other students who were there. 
“I would say I was one of the more privileged students there, because I was using a lot of USC students’ stories, not necessarily my own. I was there listening to so many first-generation students who said they didn’t even think college was an option for them until they either submitted the FAFSA for themselves, or someone in their community filled it out for them,” Samaha said. “Hearing these students’ stories and how they were first-generation and how much they relied on that need-based aid was very inspiring for me.” 
Samaha hopes the discussion will spur the Secretary to do more to help those who are overlooked by the current financial aid system.
“I think the meeting helped reassure him he was going in the right direction. It also helped him realize there’s still more that needs to be done,” Samaha said. “I think this will allow him to reconsider how they can do more, like for the middle- and lower-class students who aren’t getting a ton of aid from FAFSA or their school, but are still expected to cash out $70,000 a year in tuition.” 
Though he was impressed by the Secretary’s focus on college affordability, Samaha said much of the work of tuition relief requires the schools themselves to cooperate.
“I’m very grateful that the Secretary of Education is addressing these concerns, and I hope that our school can soon follow, because I think they have ignored the problem for too long now,” Samaha said. “In many ways, the Department of Education is years ahead of USC when it comes to college affordability and making sure every student has the opportunity to go to school.”

Clay Helton is under scrutiny after a 1-5 start to his head coaching career – Photo by Kirby Lee
I like Clay Helton, I really do. I respect him. He is a man of faith and integrity. He truly cares, and players like him. However, being a great guy doesn’t mean you should be the head football coach at USC. Nice only gets you so far, and clearly not far enough for victory. That was evident Friday night, that was evident last week and it’s been evident every single time USC has taken the field against a Power-5 opponent with Clay Helton as the permanent head football coach.
I’m sure that with time Helton would be able to grow into the USC job. He has a sharp offensive mind and possesses excellent leadership skills, so the foundation is there. However, that is all it is right now, a foundation. As a head football coach, he is unfortunately anything but a finished product, and USC always needs a finished product at the helm.
This idea of growing into the job seems to be a trend with USC football coaches lately. I take Alabama football head coach Nick Saban to be a pretty accurate judge of coaching acumen. He has pegged former USC head coaches Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian as top-flight assistants. At their current stage, that is the ceiling on their respective abilities. One day, that may change, especially under the tutelage of Saban. However, if they aren’t ready to be in charge now, why were they hired in the first place? 
I have the same question regarding Helton. I wrote last year that there was no need to rush into hiring Helton. Waiting until after the bowl game to see how he performed in marquee matchups would have been helpful. After he was hired — primarily because the players love him and he says all the right things — I held out hope that he would find his way in the offseason. That hope died on Friday night. 
Utah’s game-winning touchdown was not what finally extinguished my flicker of prayer, the fire actually went out after the game, during Helton’s press conference. When explaining his rationale for punting instead of going for it on fourth down inside the 40, he said he wanted to pin them back and “hope they can’t go 95 yards.” 
They being the team that had just carved up USC on two straight touchdown drives. USC, a team which had its offense rolling with an All-American wide receiver in junior JuJu Smith-Schuster, a tailback averaging more than 12 yards a carry on the day in senior Justin Davis and a dynamic mobile quarterback in redshirt freshman Sam Darnold who has a rifle for an arm. Instead, Helton opted to trust his defense. 
Clearly, at best that hope was wishful thinking, and at worst it was foolish and ill conceived. Still, head coaches should never hope. Head coaches know. Does Saban hope his team comes up with a stop? Does Urban Meyer? Does David Shaw? I have to imagine the answer is no. The only people who should be hoping are fans like myself who were praying for a miracle stop on Utah’s final drive.
The best coaches also play to win. If Helton was playing to win, he wouldn’t have punted inside the 40, nor would he have done the same the week before against Stanford. If he was playing to win, he wouldn’t have kept Justin Davis on the bench in the fourth quarter so he could spread out the touches among his stable of running backs. 
The list could go on and on about the grievances from the first four games. Why are there so many blown plays on defense? Why was USC playing a soft zone on the final drive against Utah?
On offense, wunderkind redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold covered up a lot of mistakes. Chief among them, keeping Davis off the field in the fourth quarter. However, untimely penalties and turnovers kept costing the team. With a thin margin of error, the cost isn’t just a 32-yard pass to Darreus Rogers for instance, it’s a loss.
If there is a bright side, it’s Darnold. He is phenomenal. For the first time since Mark Sanchez, USC has a quarterback with the velocity and fortitude to connect in between the hashes on slants and posts. He also demonstrated touch on feathery throws to redshirt junior wide receiver Steven Mitchell near the left boundary and down the middle of the field to the tight end, senior Taylor McNamara. Barring injury, I think Darnold has the chance to be the best quarterback at USC since Matt Leinart or Carson Palmer.
But what Darnold covered up was an offensive scheme that calls plays instead of running an actual offense. It seems that the Trojans are reading from a script all too often. If they run it three times, they have to pass the next time. Never mind the fact that those three runs are for big yards. It cost USC early against Stanford, and if Darnold didn’t make some big plays on third down against the Utes, it would have been the same story again.
At the end of the day, Clay Helton has forgotten more football X’s and O’s than I will ever know. I feel bad even writing this, as Helton seems like a truly tremendous individual. He just isn’t ready to run USC at the moment. His emphasis on moral victories is great for lessons and character building, but it doesn’t absolve him of being 1-3 this season and 1-5 since he took over.
My hope is that Darnold’s talent covers up a lot of errors over the next few weeks, as Helton learns more and more, just as Dabo Swinney did at Clemson. Great quarterbacks make up for a lot; Cam Newton won a title with Gene Chizik as coach. Darnold isn’t Newton just yet, but he is pretty special. I do hope Helton evolves, but as we learned Friday night, hope just isn’t enough sometimes. 
 Jake Davidson is a senior majoring in accounting. His column, “Davidson’s Direction,” runs Mondays.
I’m sure Helton’s future at USC is the first and last thing Lynn Swann thinks about day in and day out.  Problem is, we have had four head coaches in four years.  Who in their right mind would take the head coaching job if he fired him??  We all want USC to win, but we should look at this season as a rebuilding season.  There will be some wins and some losses and it might even be a losing season, who knows?  I say we give Helton a few years before we rush to calling for his head like we did the last three coaches.  Fight on.
a lot of what you are saying is true. But to use that punt as your make-or-break moment that Helton can’t handle the job is just not a good argument. 
Regardless of our 12-yard per carry rb or darnolds arm strength, 4th and 3 is no gime. This isn’t a 4th and less than 1, shove the qb up the middle to gain a foot. It’s a tough distance. 
Missing here gives the ball to Utah, 25 yards from fg range, in a 3 point game.  And, with 5+ minutes left in the game, there is no guarantee that picking up the 4th down wins you that game either. There is still tons of time. Punting is the right decision there imo, but even if you disagree, there is a clear case to be made for Helton. (Unlike when he inexplicitly punted on 4th and 5 af the Stanford 40, down 17 in the 4th quarter)
If you think “the best coaches play to win” means being aggressive on 4th down, you didn’t watch the Stanford Ucla game. 
We need Les Miles.
I like the article. Its definitely written by a fellow trojan who has felt the pain in the last 4 weeks, the one who knows the USC brand. Our AD made a mistake by jumping on decision too early. Like every mature person, he should have weighed all the options and made the decision. I hope our new AD will not repeat the same mistake.
 Keep it up and Fight On!
You people got instant gratification mentalities.
The whole atmosphere in the football program stinks right now. Mental and physical problems exist throughout.
What does faith have to do with getting the job done well? Helton was hired by then AD Haden because he would win the
right way according to Pat’s mantra. Helton needs to win the next two at home to save this season from a complete melt
down. It will not be easy. ASU is undefeated while Colorado beat Oregon in Eugene last Saturday. Where is Ed Orgeron
when you need him? Oh, he was just made interim Head Coach at LSU .

Two-way player · Junior driver Blake Edwards is among the team leaders in goals, but came up strong defensively over the weekend.
The No. 2 men’s water polo team left UC Berkeley’s Spieker Aquatics Complex with a third-place finish, but also suffered its first defeat of the season.
The Trojans could be in jeopardy of dropping in the rankings after losing to host No. 3 Cal 10-8 on Saturday. 
Their weekend started off on a dominating note, as USC trounced Santa Clara 21-4 thanks to a flurry of goals. Within the first 16 minutes, 11 different Men of Troy netted goals, while junior goalie McQuin Baron completely shut out a Santa Clara offense that has struggled against top teams this season. 
USC replaced Baron with backup goalie Simon Wu in the third period, who kept the Broncos at bay before freshman Will Rubschlager took over in the fourth. 
At the end of four periods, over 15 different Trojans scored goals, with redshirt sophomore driver Chase Kaplow’s hat trick leading the way for junior driver Grant Stein, freshman two-meter Matt Maier, freshman driver Marin Dasic and redshirt junior driver Mitch Embrey to each net two goals of their own. In comparison to just four saves from Santa Clara goalie Patrick Collins, USC blocked 14 Bronco shot attempts.
With nine saves against Santa Clara, Baron followed it up with a tougher match against No. 7 Long Beach State, but another win nonetheless. 
The first half started out well for the Trojans, who outscored the 49ers 5-2, thanks to strong defense from the Men of Troy. Eventually, USC led 8-2 with Long Beach, scoring two goals within the final four minutes to make the score 9-4. 
The most impressive stat for the Trojans, other than Baron’s 13 saves, would have to be the 24 minutes that USC held Long Beach State scoreless. Junior driver Blake Edwards and junior utility Bryce Hoerman led the way defensively with a combination of steals and field blocks. 
In terms of scoring, junior two-meter Lachlan Edwards and Maier capitalized on power play opportunities early on as junior driver Grant Stein, junior utility Mihajlo Milicevic, senior driver Nick Bell, sophomore driver Zach D’Sa, Edwards and redshirt freshman driver Sam Slobodien each scored in a commanding victory.
The biggest test of the tourney for Southern Cal came against Cal, who ended USC’s eight-game winning streak with a 10-8 victory. 
While the Trojans were able to score 2 unanswered goals to put them up 2-1 in the first period, Cal would end up tallying five straight goals to go up 6-2 by halftime. 
After holding Santa Clara to a 24-minute scoreless streak earlier in the tournament, the Golden Bears prevented USC from scoring for 15 minutes. With an 8-3 lead heading into the final period of play, the  deficit was too great for USC to overcome as Cal took the semi-final matchup.
Stein led the Trojans with two goals, and freshman drivers Thomas Dunstan and Marin Dasic, junior driver Matteo Morelli Maier, Blake Edwards and Bell also each netted goals for USC. 
Against No. 4 Pacific, the Trojans jumped out to a 3-0 lead after one quarter en route to an 8-3 win to claim third place. Pacific rallied to get within one at 4-3 in the third period, but the Trojans, behind two goals from Stein, scored four unanswered to coast to victory, 
The Trojans defense, despite playing a Pacific offense that scored 15 or more goals in eight of its first 12 games, was steadfast in the win. 
Next up, the Trojans will face the Tigers again this Saturday at 1 p.m.
The loss means nothing in the regular season. It comes down to the conference tournament, and then
the national one. You have to peak at that time. It is always one of four teams ( USC, ucla, Cal, or Stanford )
that winds up winning the title.

On Saturday, Thomas Jack returned to Los Angeles to kick off a two-night residency at Sound Nightclub in Hollywood. The tropical house DJ played to a packed house after an opening act by Dutch duo The Him. While Jack is not necessarily the typical Hollywood club DJ, a line formed down the block of people eager to witness one of his notoriously laid-back sets.
 Revered as the inventor of the electronic music sub-genre “tropical house,” Thomas Jack worked his way through the mainstream and commercial music scene at just 20 years old. His breakout hit single “Final Speech” launched him to the top of the Hype Machine charts in 2013.
 Since then, he has built upon this success with making captivating remixes of popular songs as well as producing original music. Utilizing live instruments such as saxophones, flutes and trumpets, Jack’s beats are mellow, yet upbeat. His music instantly transports listeners to a warm summer day at the beach, reminiscent of the Australian native’s home country.
 At Sound, Jack proved that his wave of success will not be crashing any time soon. Known for varying his sets at each performance, the DJ played a mix of fan favorites and new material. The crowd was energized for his most recent hit “Rise Up,” which features vocals by Jasmine Thompson. Everyone sang along to the relatable lyrics and danced to the catchy flute melody. The song is just a preview of what is to come from the DJ as he continues to work on his debut studio album.
 In an interview with Your EDM, Jack hinted at transitioning away from his traditional tropical house sound.
 “When I first started making tropical house with people like Kygo, I thought it was the dopest sh-t ever,” he said. “It still is, I still love it, but for me it’s already done.”
 He continued to reflect about the balance of playing new material without alienating his current fan base.
 The positive reaction to the music Jack experimented with at Sound on Saturday proves that he has been able to find that happy medium of continuing to change up the electronic music scene and catering to the people that have listened to his music from the start.
 Thomas Jack will perform again at Sound on Oct. 1.

Photo courtesy of Decca RecordsMoves like Jagger · The Rolling Stones will perform at both weekends of the music festival. Lead vocalist Mick Jagger (above) is one of several anticipated artists to perform at Desert Trip this year.
Desert Trip will be an exciting and rare opportunity for fans to see Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Who, Roger Waters and Neil Young perform together. The rock music festival will take place in Indio, Calif. for two consecutive weekends during October.
 At the festival, event and concert organizer Goldenvoice will be hosting the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees at the Empire Polo Club, where there will be both general admission and reserved seating as well as car camping for a classic music festival experience.
 The event is expected to attract many food lovers as well, as there will be delicacies from regional and national restaurants and exclusive dining experiences prepared by renowned chefs specifically for the Desert Trip event. Attendees who decide not to camp have many lodging options at the festival grounds, as well as in Indio or Palm Springs.
 Goldenvoice’s arrangement to have these legends of rock perform has been a long time coming, and is expected to cost over $50 million for the artists and production setups. Despite their ages, both Paul McCartney and The Rolling Stones have earned several million dollars per concert performance during their most successful concert tours.
 Roger Waters, who is no stranger to the domestic and international tours of his peers, finished one of the highest grossing tours of all time after a multi-year stint with Live Nation from 2010 to 2013. Many of the artists have just released or will release remastered or new albums, most notably Neil Young, whose album The Monsanto Years has sparked conversations for its political themes.
 McCartney will be releasing a re-mastering of hits entitled Pure McCartney, which primarily focuses on his post-Beatles work. McCartney will also perform his anthems from his days with The Fab Four, as fans of the singer will want to re-live performances from Beatlemania following new documentary Eight Days a Week, which was released on Sept. 16 and McCartney has promoted along with USC alumnus Ron Howard. The documentary details the band’s tours and explosion onto American pop music.
 Mick Jagger and the Stones previously performed in Latin America in 2016 and will be making a stop in the Southwestern United States to coincide with Desert Trip.
 Fans willing to fork over the hefty festival ticket price and make accommodations will undoubtedly be witnesses to perhaps the most successful, decorated and influential group of bands and artists to share a festival  stage.
 Weekend 1 will take place Oct. 7 to 9 and Weekend 2 will take place Oct. 14 to 16. Tickets for general admission start at $399, and more luxurious seating options with reservations and food can run as high as $1599 for a weekend.
Roger Waters was Trump before Trump became cool to that half basket of deplorables. The louder and more incessantly a lie repeated, the more people will accept it as truth. He has been lying that he wrote all the lyrics on “The Wall” for more than 37 years. Pathetic that a musical and lyric genius is still sticking to his guns. Trump is Trump, and Roger Waters is a plagiarist and liar.

Coined “Fairfax’s Hippest New Boba Shop” by Los Angeles Eater, Pearl’s Finest Teas blends right in with Fairfax’s hip aesthetic of streetwear brands and sneaker stores, located several blocks down from Diamond Supply Co. and Supreme. With a trendy atmosphere and tasteful drink options, Pearl’s is destined for success.
 The shop’s simple exterior is invitingly minimalistic, with two bold phrases plastered onto its glass door walls: #PARTEANEXTDOOR and BOBA. Inside, however, is where the tea-making magic is.
 To the right, huge palm leaf prints are plastered against a light pink wall, with a sprinkle of clever hashtags. To the left, a clean wall menu reveals a wide variety of tea options, ranging from non-caffeinated drinks to the standard milk teas.
 The menu also separates drinks into categories for customer convenience, since the store draws many first-time tea enthusiasts from its diverse neighborhood. There are four categories — The Standard, Coffee, The Finest and Herbal Mist — alongside a “Customize Your Tea” option for L.A. tea connoisseurs.
 Pearl’s proudest drinks, however, are found in its Finest category, boasting of unique names, flavors and positive responses on its Instagram. L.A. Dirt, Orange Yuzu and Chamango are only a few to name under The Finest option, which ranges from a horchata milk tea to sea-salt coffee with a hint of oreo. The rest of their menu, however, should not be overlooked.
Terry Nguyen | Daily TrojanBoba time · Pearl’s Finest Teas offers a wide variety of tea drinks in four different menu categories. The Horchata Milk Tea (above), a mix of Mexican and Asian flavors, is one of the items on the menu.
The Herbal Mist category, although several cents pricier than their standard drinks, offers a selection of brewed and roasted teas with floral inspired flavors, like Blooming Blossom, Wild Lavender and Pink Rose Bud. The Herbal Mist teas contain honey instead of sugar, and some are brewed on the spot for distinct, fresh flavors.
 In contrast to  some other traditional boba shops, Pearl’s offers hot teas in addition to its cold and blended styles. Its customizable milk choices are perfect, catering to non-dairy consumers with hemp, soy and non-dairy options. Pearl’s  offers standard selections coupled with refreshing flavors. Customers can stick to the menu or order their own fancy creations.
 The best part is, Pearl’s drinks do not contain artificial powders used by many boba shops. Its honey boba — one of eight topping choices — has a chewy consistency and is given generously in its drinks. For a $4 to $5 price range with no additional toppings, Pearl’s drinks appear to fall on the pricier side, but its cup sizes (24 oz. for cold drinks and 20 oz. for hot) compensate for that factor. The drinks are not filling, but serve as a refreshing treat to sip on any time of the day.
 Already, Pearl’s has attracted much attention from their local community, even if its grand opening is expected to take place in October. Pearl’s atmosphere draws pedestrians and shoppers into its comfortably modern setting. The marble tabletops, bar stools, cushioned seats and free Wi-Fi invite customers to stay awhile and enjoy a drink before continuing their shopping routine. Pearl’s Finest Teas is located on Fairfax Avenue and is open daily from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.

Mimi Tran Zambetti | Daily Trojan
If you glance at the news, you might see legions of politicians, researchers and talk show hosts dissecting why young people often don’t vote.  But while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump struggle to rally young people to their causes, President Barack Obama, in the last few months of his term, is enjoying a 58 percent approval rating, partially thanks to under-25 voters who support him the most of any age group.  This raises the question of why “Generation Me” may well go down in history as “Generation Obama.” Despite stagnation on many important policy fronts, Obama, through his poise and authenticity, inspired millennials to take a chance on politics, cementing his legacy in the eyes of the younger generation as one of progress, and above all, hope.
Throughout his time in office, Obama established himself as trustworthy, personal and authentic, and not just by  political standards.  Thanks to eight scandal-free years, this image has changed very little.  These words and actions isolated seem humorous, unconventional, or eyebrow raising, but in totality, they reveal a man who strives to hide nothing and share everything with young voters, America and the world.
Yet personality can only get politicians so far.  Maybe that’s why Obama and his administration produced a mixed bag of results for enacting policies that college students find to be the most important and pressing.  According to a youth poll conducted by Harvard, 64 percent of millennials rank the economy as their top priority.  For many college students and graduates, student debt compounds already existing economic woes.  Even though the White House recently penned legislation to provide more transparency in the loan process and more options for repayment, 43 million Americans, many of them millennials, owe a whopping $1.3 trillion in student debt. However, the Obama administration can claim credit for the real median household income increasing by 5.2 percent this year, poverty decreasing by 1.2 percent, and the share of Americans who lack healthcare dropping by 1.3 percent. 
During the past eight years, young voters prioritized reducing inequality.  Obama certainly represented a step in the right direction — but young people quickly found out that one man can’t fix race relations, and that the gap between the rich and poor represented more of a chasm.  Our generation woke up to the reality that an idealist can’t break the gridlock in Washington and advance a compressive climate change plan. Despite  executive action on the part of Obama to reduce gun violence, gun show loopholes abound and violent crime continues to rise this year while mass shootings stain newsfeeds.
 The next president will still inherit a full plate of young voters’ concerns, but this distracts from Obama and his administration’s legacy of progress come Jan. 20.  Under Obama’s watch, the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, and legislation advanced the cause of the LGBT community, all  to the delight of the “most tolerant” generation.  Internationally, to the generation that believes in diplomacy the most, the normalization of relations with Cuba and the Iran Deal came as welcome reliefs.  Despite later troop surges and drone strikes, Obama earned himself the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for his work in diplomacy and fostering cooperation internationally. These accomplishments, among others, enabled Obama to improve the United States’ image in the world. All things said, through his policies and demeanors, Obama represented a clear break from the past and embodied the path to the future.  He “kept it real,” but still managed to strive for the ideal.  In the same vein as his popular predecessors such as Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, Obama attempted to maintain a dialogue with the American people.  And his message especially resounded with young voters who “liked” his new Facebook White House page (where users can actually send notes to the president), watched his humorous and sentimental viral videos and believed in his message “Change.” For the younger generations he did, as his campaign slogan promised, provide a little hope.
The author writes, “in the last few months of his term, is enjoying a 58 percent approval rating, partially thanks to under-25 voters who support him the most of any age group.”
What an interesting statement since any idiot would know that using the word “enjoying” right before “58% approval rating” right before “thanks to under-25 voters who support him” doesn’t do anybody a favor. The author, who clearly has an uneducated admiration for the President, does a better job than conservatives in shining poor light on him. I love that fact that the author thinks that having college students “approving” President Obama is such a great political legacy to have. What better than to finish eight years of mediocrity than gathering the virtual endorsement of naive, half-drunk twenty-some year olds who also happen to be the same demographic with the lowest rate of participation in voting out of all age groups.
Eight years of an Obama presidency and we have the worse race relations in two generations.  Eight years of an Obama presidency and we are no safer than we were prior to 9/11/2001.  Eight years of an Obama presidency and the federal debt has more than doubled.  The millennials need to think long and hard about who it places its hope for change in come November.

Edward Snowden — the National Security Agency subcontractor who in 2013 leaked classified information about NSA surveillance activities — has reemerged as a central talking point in national news. His ascendance back into the news cycle coincides with the release of the film Snowden and a recent campaign by human rights groups urging President Barack Obama to pardon Snowden. In response, Congressional lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee unanimously signed a letter on Sept. 15 addressed to Obama, entreating him to disregard this campaign. The perennial debate remains: Is Edward Snowden a hero or a traitor?
The question is a false bifurcation more invested in distracting drama than a nuanced conversation about government transparency and privacy in the digital age. For young people, specifically college-age students, the extent to which one can preserve a secure online identity should be a personal query of absolute importance. Our social media profiles have become depositories for the most intimate and seemingly banal details of our lives — where we work and study, what we like, who we speak to and when we are actually socializing. All of our activity on the Internet — from Facebook interactions to shopping on Amazon and selecting a series on Netflix — is being quietly and invisibly used to survey, manipulate and shape our preferences. 
We mostly meet the intrusion of greater human and artificial intelligence into our daily lives with an air of indifference. For many, the acceptance of this reality corresponds with the internalization of a narrative that tells us that we must be willing to forfeit more of our privacy for national security. According to one poll conducted in 2013, six in 10 Americans indicated that they disapproved of the federal government collecting their phone records in order to combat terrorism. However, about 75 percent of the people surveyed said they approved of the government tracking the phone records of Americans suspected of terrorism. About the same number of people also said they approved of the government analyzing the web activity of people living in foreign states. Today, those six in 10 Americans seem to have disappeared into obscurity, as we continue to grapple with the same questions three years later. 
 No evidence suggests that the NSA’s watchful eye makes us any safer. Instead, investigations into the effectiveness of these programs reveal that the intel collected from Americans’ metadata is negligible. In the wake of Snowden’s revelations, the former NSA Director, Gen. Keith Alexander, claimed in June 2013 that the agency, under his leadership, disrupted 54 terrorist plots. By October, he reduced the number of foiled plots to “one or two.” We do, however, know of all the attacks the NSA failed to prevent: the Boston bombings, the San Bernardino attack, the Orlando shooting and now, it appears, the Minnesota stabbing and New York bombings. In the case of the Boston bombings, one of the terrorists was on the FBI watchlist, and the other left a trail of warnings on social media. 
Mass surveillance programs collecting the metadata of millions of Americans are ineffective counterterrorism measures. They are ineffective not only because of their inability to prevent the atrocities we have seen in the last three years; but also because of their exorbitant cost. The cost of these programs is not purely calculated in dollar signs. There are the diplomatic costs, as countries learn more about U.S. surveillance of their citizens. There are the social costs, as American citizens remain largely in the dark about what the government does with their personal information, without sufficient oversight from Congress or an accessible forum to challenge this intrusion. And, finally, there are the costs to our technical systems, which have become increasingly vulnerable to abuse from other states.
The more the United States decides to surveil its citizens on the internet and other forms of communication technology, the more susceptible the country becomes to interference from other states. Creating a guarded digital world will require greater transparency from government agencies, a commitment among global leaders to a secure World Wide Web, and broader laws that can keep up with the rate at which technology is evolving. These laws will require new enforcement technologies and an international regime that can effectively subdue bad actors across a range of global issues: weapon non-proliferation, human trafficking and illicit trade. In summary, we must abandon the conflation of security and surveillance, and instead adopt a new paradigm that prioritizes transparency, the rule of law and coalition-building.

The Sexual Assault Task Force, which was established in 2014, is now a permanent annual committee. The Office of the Provost formed the Sexual Assault Task Force in order to prevent and combat sexual misconduct at USC. The force took many measures to work towards its goals; it created the Sexual Assault Resource Center website, relocated Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services to the health center and promoted bystander education.
Dr. Ainsley Carry, Vice President for Student Affairs at USC, elaborated on this vital step the committee has taken.
“We are doubling down on efforts to prevent sexual misconduct via education,” he said. “Every year the committee evaluates what is in place and how it is working. When there are opportunities to make improvements, we will advance those as we have over the past two years. Until we have zero incidents of sexual misconduct, there is always work for the committee to consider.” 
Megan Andersen, a freshman majoring in biochemistry, expressed her gratitude for this vital step the university has taken.
“As much as I think it’s great that sexual violence is an issue that keeps getting more attention, just talking about it is not enough,” she said. “There need to be tangible resources for people that have experienced or are concerned about sexual violence, something that a permanent task force will be able to improve for the Trojan community. We need a task force that is visible so that it is clear that there is help for anyone who needs it.”
The 2015-2016 committee made many recommendations to further improve the safety of USC. These improvements have either already been or are currently being implemented. The force noticed that the USC’s sexual misconduct policy was difficult to locate in the Student Handbook, so they rewrote and published it as a standalone document.
It also gained data that students are often confused in understanding affirmative consent, so the new Policy and Procedure on Student Sexual, Interpersonal and Protected Class Misconduct clarifies this necessary principle. Furthermore, a new subcommittee will work toward increasing awareness about consent this semester.
In addition, the force noticed that there are multiple student-led campaigns focused on topics including bystander intervention and sexual assault, but they might be stronger together. Therefore, it recommended a single unit that will likely be more effective in raising awareness. In order to ensure that students feel as safe as possible, the force made a LifeSafe App recommendation, which states that there should be the addition of locations and contact information for University resource centers.
Zaynab Zia, a freshman majoring in business administration, shared her insights about the importance of the task force in the context of the nation as a whole.
“With so many cases of sexual assault throughout the country, I believe it is very important to establish a permanent sexual assault combat team,” she said “The University is not only protecting us Trojans, but also setting a perfect example for other universities across the nation.”
Participation is open to students, who can become members of a variety of different subcommittees. Each subcommittee will have a mandatory training on Sept. 30 from 2-4 p.m. in the Trojan Conference Room of the health center.
