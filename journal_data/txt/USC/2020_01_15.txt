A new exhibit and public program series at the new Roski Graduate Gallery in L.A.’s Arts District arrived Wednesday. Organized and curated by the 2020 Master of Arts candidates in the Curatorial Practices and the Public Sphere program, the new exhibit titled “one never remembers alone: visual transmission of kinship and memory” seeks to explore the idea of memory — specifically that of cultural heritage — as it is experienced across time and space. 
According to a November press release from the Roski School of Art and Design, the artists featured in this exhibition work in a variety of media, ranging from painting and photography to performance and sculpture. They also have cultural ties to countries such as El Salvador, Jamaica and Vietnam. 
While the artists differ in their respective media types, each seeks to reflect on their individual and shared lineages. The title of the exhibit is derived from the idea of cultural identity and shared memory as forms of social phenomena. As such, “one never remembers alone” takes a critical lens to diaspora and dispossession across various generations and focuses on how both affect the formation of collective memory. 
An example from the exhibition is a photomontage series by Ann Le titled “World Wars,” 2019. In her work, Le overlays a historical image (depicted in black and white) and a personal photograph (depicted in color). In doing this, Le communicates the memories of home, disruption and displacement as experienced by her culture and her family over generations. 
Another example is a still shot from a video created by Sebastián Hernández titled “BROWN ZERO,” 2016, which depicts a central figure dressed in indigenous regalia surrounded by a colorful laser light display. In this piece, Hernandez plays on the concept of “ground zero,” a phrase often used when referring to a place of destruction and desolation, to comment on the multi-generational trauma inflicted on many indigenous populations as a result of colonialism. 
The 2020 M.A. candidates who organized the exhibition include Loujain Bager, Eve Moeykens-Arballo, Bianca Moran, Carlo Tuason and Joseph Valencia. Participating artists include Amal Amer, Beatriz Cortez, Maria Dumlao, Hernández, Le, Joiri Minaya, Boone Nguyen and Adee Roberson. 
 The exhibition will be on display at the Roski Graduate Gallery from Jan. 15 to Feb. 2, Wednesday through Sunday or by appointment.

The Gould School of Law’s Experiential Learning announced last semester that it will offer a brand new legal externship class for students this semester, helping students develop a battery of skills to assess and combat factors leading to homelessness in the city community. 
The externships are designed to help students jump into complex issues and begin to untangle the knots that keep community members mired in debt, lost in immigration complications and stranded on Los Angeles streets. Students will develop practices for interviewing those experiencing homelessness by performing legal assessments, identifying structural problems that lead to housing insecurity and collaborating with social workers. These factors promise to set the externship program up for success, yet there is still much about the class that remains in question.
While the homeless advocacy externship promises to create an atmosphere for community outreach and collaboration, there is little information about the class on Gould’s Office of Experiential Learning webpage, and externship opportunities are only available to students who have completed their first year of studies in law at USC. Students who are interested in externships are directed to email the office with inquiries, which may potentially prevent students from applying if they think this experience will discourage them from acquiring more glamorous positions, like externships with BBC Studios America and Marvel later in their academic careers. 
Students must also consider whether participating in the program will actually change anything about how lawmakers and security professionals treat homeless members of the L.A. community, since the course lasts only one semester. Externs will be working against a system that has been in place for decades and will work on a case-by-case basis to determine which policies need to be changed to improve at-risk peoples’ quality of life. Students may end up entering their experiential learning course bright-eyed and leaving jaded, disappointed that their hard work may lead nowhere after they have presented their findings and left their work for further review.
This course also neglects to address other ways that passionate students can get involved with homelessness advocacy on campus. Trojans are often shocked by the housing insecurity they see on the streets surrounding the University Park and Health Science campuses, yet we are eventually taught to keep our heads down when passing homeless individuals on the street. When students are taught to use USC’s Lyft Safe Ride Program to get to off-campus destinations, protect their safety and avoid certain areas after dark, they are taught to simultaneously regard the surroundings as dangerous. 
It is easy to let the darkness swallow those huddled out in the cold as passers by walk away. A billboard near Union Station reminding commuters that “homelessness kills” is despairingly easy to ignore after it becomes part of one’s daily commute. It is easy to become immune to images of human suffering while living in L.A.
Alternatively, students can work against this numbing acceptance of homelessness by joining a variety of courses and organizations on campus. Joint Educational Project offers opportunities such as volunteering with Chrysalis, an organization that helps low-income community members build resumes and prepare for job interviews. Midnight Mission offers meal services, counseling, job training and work placement for hundreds of individuals living near Skid Row. 
Volunteering with Midnight Mission is a transformative experience. Student volunteers are kept busy sorting cans, organizing to-go bags and serving meals while visitors fill up their trays with warm, healthy food. Outside the streets are thick with tents, but indoors, the charity works to form connections between individuals facing completely different realities.
Unless the Gould externship includes hands-on volunteer work in Skid Row soup kitchens like Midnight Mission, students will miss much of the spirit that make these organizations’ fight against homelessness possible.
Additionally, students can volunteer to serve in clubs, like Share a Meal, which works to combat food insecurity in the L.A. community. The USC Homelessness Initiative offers many more opportunities for students to fight back against homelessness, and it serves as a comprehensive resource for finding out how you can get involved in your community right now.
While the new Gould experiential learning course promises to help law students develop practical skills and connect with policy-making L.A. offices, there is a wealth of under-utilized opportunities that are more relevant to the rest of the student body here at USC. Everyone can contribute their skills as we work to solve the homelessness crisis in L.A., whether that comes through the new Gould externship or volunteering to serve breakfast with strangers at USC Friends & Neighbors Day events. 
These opportunities serve to treat the symptoms of homelessness, as they help volunteers get to know individuals and eventually help charitable organizations solve the issue on a case-by-case basis. This partnership is necessary in trying to figure out why Angelenos became homeless in the first place. 
The Gould School just added another weapon against inequality to the Trojan Family’s toolbox. It is ultimately the job of students to take a chance and wield whichever opportunity fits best.

With the beginning of the new semester comes the annual Spring Career Fair. For many students close to graduating and seeking out jobs, the career fair is an opportunity to meet with recruiters to discuss open positions, interview, exchange resumes and network. However, if one is seeking a career that is not within the realms of business or finance, then the career fair may be limited with what it can offer in terms of a recruiting platform. 
The career fair lacks job diversity as the majority of companies that attend are geared toward students in the Marshall School of Business or the Leventhal School of Accounting. While this is a great networking opportunity for those students, others whose career interests are not within that realm are excluded. USC prides itself on being a well-known and respected university within the arts and entertainment industry, but that’s not evident at the career fairs. 
Where are the big media and entertainment companies such as Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, BuzzFeed or Vice? According to LinkedIn, Netflix has more than 300 former Trojans working there, so why is it difficult to invite someone to host a table at the career fair? Hulu has more than 100 employees in the USC network, while Spotify and Buzzfeed have more than 70 combined. The point is that the Trojan Network is strong but it’s not being well represented at the career fairs. These companies are just a few of the many that should be more present alongside others. 
Based on ConnectSC, employers for this spring’s fair primarily involve business and finance related opportunities with attendance from AuditBoard, CoreVest Finance, Farmers Insurance, Signature Consultants, PennyMac and Oracle among others. Yes, business and finance are popular majors at USC and have large student populations, but these fields don’t encompass all interests. 
Graduates often martriculate into the tech industry, and even those companies rarely appear at the career fair in as large numbers as others. Where is Google, Facebook, Apple, or Intel? Sure, Google might have come last Fall to host a Trojan Talk, but that does not offer the intimacy and networking opportunities present at the career fairs where students get the opportunity to actually speak with recruiters and hand over a resume. Most of the time, Trojan Talks get so impacted when a big name company visits that they hit capacity, barring some students from attending. 
Students can greatly benefit from having the networking opportunities that USC offers, but this offer needs to be extended to all majors, not just one or two. USC is big in journalism, media, entertainment and tech alongside business and accounting. But the platform does not invite companies from all of these industries for recruiting opportunities. USC needs to take more initiative in being more inclusive of all career interests.

The Environmental Student Assembly and Environmental Core submitted a letter to President Carol Folt’s office calling for USC to disclose its investment in fossil fuels. The move, according to the letter, would increase transparency with regard to the portion of the University endowment that funds the nonrenewable energy industry. 
The letter was written and signed by ECore representative Tianna Shaw-Wakeman and ESA co-executive director Nathaniel Hyman. It was also co-sponsored by members of the Undergraduate Student Government, Graduate Student Government, the Office of Sustainability and professors Rob McConnell and Stephen Gratwick.
The letter states that as USC experiences a transitional period with its new president, there is an opportunity to emphasize University-wide goals that prioritize sustainability. Hyman said a shift away from fossil fuel investment would be an important step for the University in terms of sustainability, an area that Folt has made a hallmark of her presidency.
“The University of Southern California has a tremendous opportunity through divestment to become part of that economic transition to a more sustainable and just energy economy,” Hyman said.
Folt has not yet issued a public response to this letter, but the Office of the President has reached out to the students involved and is currently working to set up a meeting. 
“I met with Dr. Folt earlier today and she was hoping to schedule a meeting with you and any of the other members of the USC community who co-sponsored the letter to discuss USC’s energy investments and our future plans,” Chief of Staff Rene Pak wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “As she is only 6 months into her presidency, she is just getting started with her review of this area but is in early conversations with our board and investment committee.”
Open town halls and regular letters from Folt demonstrate the current administration’s commitment to transparency, and the letter asks that this transparency extend to disclosing where the University’s endowment money is invested. 
“Endowment spending, which has historically been impervious to inquiry from students, staff, faculty and the public, must also be included in the University’s push towards transparency,” the letter read.
The University’s current endowment is $5.54 billion. If less than 1% is invested in fossil fuels, millions of University dollars are funding the industry. 
The letter asserts that although USC is lessening its carbon output and expanding the Office of Sustainability, these actions help the University catch up with other schools, not put it ahead.
“Though USC is a trailblazer in matters of development and research, USC has lacked behind peers in sustainability,” the letter read. “Divestment is our chance.”
In 2016, the University of Massachusetts divested all fossil fuel holdings, as did Syracuse University. Columbia, Georgetown and Stanford universities all divested from coal industries, with Stanford pulling $18.7 billion of its endowment from stock in coal mining companies in 2014.
USG Director of Sustainability Affairs Isabella Caltabiano, who co-sponsored the letter, said it served as a way to hold the University responsible for some of the past energy investments made by its donors. 
“It was really calling to President Folt to first just let us know what USC has invested in fossil fuel,” Caltabiano said. “If you ever look into our history, [Edward] Doheny was an oil tycoon, and there are other names, especially involved in USC’s campus, that have come from oil money.”
Hyman said the primary goal of the letter is for the administration to disclose the amount of money the University invests in what he called unclean energy — unrenewable energy that often contributes to pollution such as burning coal or gas — and the long-term goal is to use that money to fund clean energy.
“It’s important that we don’t just use those funds to divest from something that is tangibly and verifiably hurting their students and hurting the public,” Hyman said. “[It’s] also an opportunity for us to invest in renewables, which now have a pretty impressive return on investment — perhaps even more profitable for endowment than that of all the outdated, archaic fossil fuels such as natural gas, petroleum and coal.”
While the letter addresses the current administration, campus environmental leaders realize this situation was inherited.
“This letter was in no way, shape or form trying to shame President Folt that she is not doing enough,” Caltabiano said. “In comparison to the previous administration, this has really been an incredible move forward, and I think that letter was just trying to, to a degree, ask her what the student body wants and demonstrate that this is something we’re interested in.” 
As of Tuesday, the University has started conversations with the group to discuss its current divestments.

Five podcast industry experts shared their experiences creating podcasts with nearly 50 people in Wallis Annenberg Hall Tuesday. They spoke about the rise in popularity of podcasts and the future of the medium. Annenberg School of Journalism Director Gordon Stables moderated the event.
“We thought it was important to get folks in who have been at each stage of [their careers],” Stables said. “We wanted students to kind of see the scope of what people in the industry do.”
Paola Mardo, an Annenberg alumna who spoke on the panel, said finding her podcast’s target audience was pivotal in launching it. Mardo’s podcast, “Long Distance,” explores the intersection between millennial culture and the culture of first- and second-generation Filipino immigrant families.
“I know my audience: They’re Filipino Americans, they’re mostly millennials, they’re on Instagram,” Mardo said. “They want stories about them, about their experiences, about our experiences with immigrant parents or being immigrants ourselves.”
Kelly Park, a freshman majoring in communication, said she attended the event because of her interest in public broadcasting and was attracted by the opportunity to hear from podcast industry insiders who had found niches for their media.
“What they were talking about, just knowing your audience and why you’re making it and just keeping it on focus — that’s really interesting,” Park said. 
Stables said there are currently an estimated 800,000 podcasts with a combined 30 million episodes, and the podcast industry has seen exponential growth in the two decades since its launch. However, the medium faces the same issues of economic sustainability that have plagued traditional newspapers since the introduction of online journalism platforms.
“We look back at 15 or 20 years ago and the way that the rise of the internet changed the newspaper industry,” Stables said. “The discussion was if you put your content available online and don’t ask people to pay for it, it’s hard to then remonetize the idea.”
Mardo said she had difficulty funding her podcast until she launched a Patreon. Nearly 83 of her listeners donate using the platform, allowing her to continue producing her biweekly episodes.
“It used to be a monthly show, and people would write me, like, ‘How can I support you so you can do this more often?’” Mardo said. “The fact that some people are giving me $10 a month, $20 a month, $2 a month, even — I think that’s crazy. It’s enough to pay for a Netflix subscription, let alone one podcast.”
PRX Chief Content Officer John Barth, who also served on the panel, began his communication career working in public radio but switched to podcasting in the early 2000s. With the increasing popularity of podcasts, creators should make an effort to keep making podcasts for particular segments, Barth said.
“Radio is reaching mass audiences and podcasting flips that on its head because it’s so individual and intimate,” Barth said. “As podcasting gets bigger, I don’t want to lose the connection to individual voices and individual set of ears.”

Sarah Gehlert has been selected as the next School of Social Work dean, the University announced Tuesday.
Gehlert, who has served as dean of the University of South Carolina’s College of Social Work since 2017, will assume her new role in April, replacing Interim Dean Suzanne Wenzel. Executive Vice Provost Elizabeth Graddy and Davis School of Gerontology Dean Pinchas Cohen spearheaded the 16-month search for a dean.
Gehlert’s appointment comes during a tumultuous period for the School of Social Work. The school has faced criticism in recent years for its budget problems and for allegedly lowering its admissions standards in an effort to compensate for a lack of funds. 
In May, the school was operating in a budget deficit that was projected to reach an estimated $40 million by 2020, the Los Angeles Times reported, although USC administrators indicated the gap was closer to $10 million. The budget news came a year after former School of Social Work Dean Marilyn Flynn stepped down from her position and took on a role as special adviser in the Office of the Provost following the publication of an L.A. Times investigation that revealed that Flynn transferred $100,000 donated to the School of Social Work by L.A. County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas to the account of a nonprofit organization run by Ridley-Thomas’ son, Sebastian, a former USC professor.
Questions have surfaced regarding the future of the School of Social Work’s online degree offerings and lax admissions criteria. Gehlert said she plans to work with current faculty to identify areas in need of attention, taking student input into consideration.
“Making changes right away, unless there’s a real problem, would be a mistake,” Gehlert said. “I’m not going to certainly dawdle, but I am going to spend a lot of time talking to students, talking to alum, talking to staff, talking to faculty and trying to see what are the best solutions.”
Gehlert is in her fourth year as president of the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare and said she plans to continue in her role there. As dean, Gehlert said she will prioritize community engagement and encourage further research about L.A.’s homelessness epidemic.
“It’s not well known nationally how close the school’s ties to the community are,” Gehlert said. “I think that the School of Social Work has to make impact, it has to make social change and generally we start in the area where we live.”
Gehlert’s research has focused on the intersection of social and medical issues. She serves on the steering committee of the California Breast Cancer Research Program, and she said she plans to emphasize multidisciplinary approaches and partnerships with other USC schools.
“The problems that we face, the issues, the research that we do is big,” Gehlert said. “You can’t really do it in one discipline or one profession, so I’m looking forward to [collaborating with other schools].”
Central to her mission in her new position will be reinforcing the school’s commitment to providing a quality education for students who will represent and advocate for other members of the community, Gehlert said.
“The graduates that we prepare go out and have a lot of power over people who tend often to be powerless,” Gehlert said. “I take that very, very seriously. I think that our education has to be worthy of the people who we are serving.”

A parent named in the admissions scandal was indicted Tuesday on one count of filing a false tax return on the payment he made to secure his son’s admission to USC as an athletic recruit.
John Wilson paid $220,000 in April 2014 to falsely designate his son as a men’s water polo recruit. The money was divided between three bank accounts belonging to admissions scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer, including accounts for Singer’s fraudulent nonprofit and for-profit organizations. Singer redirected $100,000 of the payment to USC Athletics and issued Wilson a gift receipt for the purported donation. 
According to the indictment, Wilson claimed the money he paid in the admissions scheme as a deduction on his 2014 tax returns under the guise of donations and business expenses. The tax fraud charge carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $100,000 fine.
Wilson’s son was unaware of the arrangement, Wilson’s wife told Singer in an email, according to court documents. Singer sent former men’s water polo coach Jovan Vavic a fabricated athletic profile that presented the Wilsons’ son as an award-winning player and, on Vavic’s recommendation, the Wilsons’ son was granted admission to the University. He enrolled at USC in Fall 2014 and remained on the water polo roster until the end of the semester. 
Wilson again sought Singer’s services in Fall 2018 in the hopes of bribing athletics administrators at Stanford and Harvard universities to admit his daughters as athletic recruits, according to court documents. Wilson allegedly paid Singer $1 million to arrange for his daughters’ admissions, but Singer had already agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in the admissions scheme investigation and did not make the final payments to the school officials.
Wilson was among the 11 USC parents indicted on a count of conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery last October. He faces additional charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, aiding and abetting wire fraud and honest services wire fraud and aiding and abetting federal programs bribery and has pleaded not guilty to all five previous charges.
Wilson’s defense has not yet entered a plea for the new charge and the date of his arraignment has not been set.

Undergraduate Student Government Sens. Christopher McMorran and Emily Donahue presented the results of their undergraduate transportation survey at Tuesday’s USG meeting. 
The survey, which received nearly 960 valid responses, attempted to gauge student interest in providing public transit U-Pass subsidies for undergraduates. It also asked respondents how U-Pass subsidies would affect their current riding habits, their optimal price point and how often they traveled to Los Angeles International Airport. 
“I think this has been talked about by a lot of people for a while now,” Donahue said. “The graduate students have it, so I think we were just wondering why it wasn’t available to undergraduates.” 
McMorran discussed President Folt’s sustainability plan in relation to transportation goals.
“It’s something that we can make happen, and then, working with senators last year, and [President] Carol Folt coming in and having a big focus on sustainability, has really started the ball rolling, so we’re really excited about that,” McMorran said. 
The survey found that free or subsidized public transportation has doubled projected ridership. 
Despite 75% of the survey’s respondents identifying as noncommuter students, there was still a large interest in free subsidized public transportation.
“There was still very heavy interest in the program,” McMorran said. “This kind of shocked both of us, the degree to which people were interested.” 
“It was good for us to see that this is something that really does matter outside of USG,” McMorran added. “I think that will also encourage USC Transportation and the administration to know that we are representing the students here. This isn’t just us coming up with a little pet project, this is something that will really benefit a lot of people.” 
The program could also be used for more than commuting between home and campus. 
“Even if you’re not a commuter student, it could benefit a lot of people,” Donahue said. “I have a lot of friends who have to travel for internships, so that would be another really good purpose for this.” 
McMorran and Donahue also presented their recommendations for USG’s next steps toward implementing the project. They proposed the implementation of a 50% U-Pass subsidy for undergraduate students beginning in the middle of spring semester or next fall. 
“It’s really encouraging that USC Transportation has been really great and really receptive and is definitely looking for the student voice and student perspective,” Donahue said. “I think we’re just kind of waiting for next steps.”
The newly hired executive directors of the Black Student Assembly, Jaya Hinton and Calvin Carmichael, were also presented to the Senate by Senior Director of Programming Montana Houston. The position of assistant director remained vacant due to a lack of applicants for the position, but a secondary election may occur.
