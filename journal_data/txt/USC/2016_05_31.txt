The USC Credit Union has recently partnered with Yoobi, a classroom supply company that donates to a local school after one of their items is purchased.
The partnership is the brainchild of alumna Samantha Paxson, who is currently on the board of the USC Credit Union and is the chief marketing officer of CO-OP Financial Services. Paxson, who graduated from USC in 1997 with a dual degree in broadcast journalism and social sciences, stated that her background in journalism has been a major influence on how she has approached her own career and how she pursues potential partnerships like the one with Yoobi.
“What I’ve gained from my journalism degree and all of that background is the idea of storytelling,” Paxson said. “I’m very passionate about storytelling and the intersection of storytelling, creativity, innovation and purpose.”
According to Paxson, when she first heard about Yoobi’s products and their philanthropic aims, she immediately thought about how they could benefit the USC community.
“It got me thinking, — USC is in a community that is surrounded by several underprivileged schools, and the Yoobi mission is very much aligned with the Credit Union mission. I talked to the CEO of USC Credit Union [Gary Perez] and said, ‘There might be a partnership opportunity here.’”
When she brought this idea to Perez, Paxson said that her main selling point for the partnership was the positive impact it would have on the local community.
“We talked about being able to impact the grammar schools, the elementary schools that are directly in USC’s neighborhood, by being able to generate these classroom packs that Yoobi donates to kids in need,” she said.
The Credit Union plans to incentivize the purchasing of Yoobi products by giving discounts to members. The partnership is currently being finalized and Paxson estimates that it will be available to students at the bookstore and online at the USC Credit Union’s website by early next school year.
“Not only are you buying something that you need for your school supplies, but you’re also helping the local community and the local elementary schools ensure that they have the right tools,” Paxson said. “Teachers, on average, pay out of pocket $500 a year to get the supplies for their students. This is a way that they don’t have to do that.”
The initiative is currently being tested by CO-OP Financial Services and their member credit union in addition to the USC Credit Union and Yoobi. The program will initially start with five local schools. In addition to school supplies, Paxson said that Yoobi will also give local schools financial planning kits that will help teach schoolchildren basic financial skills.
“When they buy Yoobi school supplies, not only will school supplies be given to the surrounding elementary schools, but financial literacy kits called ‘money mammal’ kits will also be delivered,” Paxson said. “So we’re helping to give the community within USC the USC footprint to help them in their whole lives going forward.”
The hope is that these skills in financial planning will not only help elementary schoolchildren immediately, but also later in life.
“Our goal was not only to help [local students] with their educational supplies but their financial wellness,” Paxson said. “If we can help them build saving strategies at this age, by the time they’re 18 years old our hope is that they go to college and that it will improve the community as a whole.”
Correction: A previous version of the article said that the financial literacy kits were called “money manual” kits. They are called “money mammal” kits. The Daily Trojan regrets the error

On May 25, childcare employees at the University Park Campus voted to unionize under the SEIU Local 99 group, which represents K-12 and community college employees throughout Southern California. The childcare workers under KinderCare, an American corporation operating for-profit childcare.
Employees are hoping to resolve working conditions and enforce stricter teacher-to-child ratio standards. They are believed to be the first KinderCare workers to fully unionize; the company employs around 24,000 people across the United States.
Gino Sandoval, a UPC preschool teacher, spoke of the aims of the unionization in a press release, and expressed excitement at the new developments.
“We look forward to sitting down with UPC management. We hope they will quickly begin good-faith union contract negotiations so that things can improve,” Sandoval said. “This decision to unite and seek a voice at UPC came out of many late-night discussions amongst ourselves outside of work hours.”
Sandoval also spoke of the issues that workers faced at the workplace, including health and safety violations, which prompted the removal of a center director. The exact incidents were not discussed in the press release.
“We were concerned about out-of-ratio classrooms and health and safety violations. After an investigation into these critical issues, the former center director was removed. We hoped for improvement after that, but instead witnessed what we felt was ongoing mismanagement.”
SEIU Local 99 is a Southern California-based union group that represents around 45,000 employees in public and private organizations that work in the education field. SEIU Local 99 lists its mission to “protect and develop the welfare and interest of our membership.”
This development comes in a string of worker’s strikes earlier this year from healthcare workers and cafeteria employees on the Health Science Campus. On the UPC campus, adjunct faculty from both the Roski School of Art and Design and USC International Academy voted to join the Service Employees International Union Local 721.
The University did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Two USC alumni are working to make video games the key to a better tomorrow.
Alumni Kwabena Osei-Larbi, who graduated in 2015 with a degree in international relations, and Kameni Ngahdeu, who graduated in 2016 with a degree in human biology, are the co-founders of Kaydabi, a mobile game development company that combines philanthropy with entertainment. Kaydabi aims to create games that increase awareness for environmental and social issues.
Osei-Larbi and Ngahdeu started working on their startup two years ago. Coming from Ghana and Cameroon respectively, the two said that their backgrounds made them feel the need to develop Kaydabi and make a change.
“We had an interest in entrepreneurship and were passionate about games as well,” Osei-Larbi said. “We were playing games at one point and realized how powerful these games could be. This platform can bring a lot of change in making awareness and charity as fun processes.”
Kaydabi’s mobile games not only works to spread awareness for social causes but also to raise money for them. The games are free to download and play, but money can be donated through optional in-app purchases that is then donated to the different causes.
“The gaming industry is so big. To make a game and also having something positive applied to it, felt like that is what we should do,” said Ngahdeu.
Part of the success of Kaydabi is due to help from the USC Incubator program and professors like Paul Orlando, adjunct professor at the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, Anthony Borquez and Michael Napoliello, adjunct professors at USC Marshall School of Business.
“The professors at USC were super helpful. They made us see things that we weren’t aware of. After all it’s not about money but about how passionate you are in what you are doing,” Ngahdeu said. “Meeting these professors and taking those classes helped us a lot in doing this.”
Kaydabi ensures that everyone is able to take part in the social changes. Osei-Larbi cited one of his games about environmentalism as an example of the power to make a contribution by playing games.
“Our first game is themed around wildlife conservation and endangered animals. When you play the game, you get to rescue a character and vote for your favorite animal. Those votes are used to tell how much money each animal raised in that month. That money goes to the charity for saving that animal,” Osei-Larbi said. “So without spending anything in the game, users will still be able to make a difference. It is an interactive and philanthropic experience rather than just being entertainment.”
Kaydabi partners with the world’s largest wildlife conservation organizations like African Wildlife Foundation, World Parrot Trust, Sea Turtle Conservancy and Defenders of Wildlife in raising money for these causes.
“We wanted to find charities that cover all animals in the game. Each animal is tied to one of the charities so as to raise a significant amount of money for it,” said Ngahdeu.
Their first game Wild Warriors is set to launch for both Android and IOS on June 13. This game has an in-app feature that links to websites for each endangered animal that provide more information about them. People also have the option to donate money on these websites for the preservation of these animals.
Kaydabi hopes to address more topics with its games in the future, and Osei-Larbi says that this mentality to better the community is embodied in the named Kaydabi itself.
“Kaydabi is derived from a Ghanaian word meaning, ‘to learn from your past in order to build a better tomorrow,’” Osei Larbi said. Our first cause is wildlife conservation but we also want to work towards different other causes like alleviating poverty, access to clean water and child education. We hope to build a game around each of them so that we can raise money and awareness about it.”

On May 27, Australian electronic music producer and artist Harley Streten, better known as Flume, released his sophomore album Skin. The electronic album features 16 tracks that create a chaotic but uniform mood. Flume’s production embodies a surface-level sound that listeners can hear, but captures one’s inner being through melodies and vibrations.
The album begins with the track “Helix,” which features a calming flute that gradually merges into Flume’s familiar and signature sound. The heart-palpitating track sets a precedent for the remainder of the album. Skin builds on relaxation and calmness until it breaks to form chaos, moving away from a set and standardized sound.
The following track “Never Be Like You,” utilizes synth progressions and first-person lyrics to illustrate the vulnerability of being in a committed relationship. Featured artist Kai sings about having a “fickle-minded heart,” but is desperately begging for forgiveness.
Flume’s capability as a musician is heard throughout this album. The diversity Flume features in his assortment of all-star collaborators (ranging from Tove Lo, Beck and Vince Staples, to name a few), genres and sounds establishes a strong groundwork for Skin. His innovative musical approach can be heard in not only this album, but also his debut album Flume.
While most tracks are beautifully composed, some album highlights include “Numb & Getting Colder” featuring Kučka. Others include “Innocence,” which has a certain authenticity through its vinyl-esque sound, and “Wall F**k,” which contrasts the former and its distorted high-pitch sounds with dense beats. Though Flume doesn’t stray from his distinctive sound, each track is markedly different from the other. He successfully explores a broad spectrum of intricate complexities to create unique, and sonically cohesive sounds.
Skin also touches on the essence of youth and innocence. “When Everything Was New”  sends a message about childhood wonder. It is a simplistic song with a powerful underlying message, featuring the sound of an elementary school classroom in the background. The song embodies the pureness of children and the days of adolescence.
While the album name Skin projects visions of flesh and externalities, it is a metaphysical representation of the soul. Skin is about transcending beyond what one typically sees -— it’s about expanding one’s mind to countless possibilities and being open to the world around. Flume’s album is for wild hearts and wild minds. It’s for listeners to find comfort in their own skin and soul.

21-year-old Angela Cross is a Vietnamese-American singer-songwriter based in Los Angeles. A lover of arts and fashion, Cross is a senior majoring in fine arts with an emphasis in graphic design and painting. With a music style that is a fusion of soul, pop, R&B and rock, her infectious energy and soulful voice is hard to go unnoticed. Angela Cross released her first music video on April 20 and is set to record her new EP in July. Cross sat down with the Daily Trojan for an exclusive interview about the inspiration behind her music and how she began her career as an artist.
Daily Trojan: What/who inspired you to be a singer-songwriter?
Angela Cross: My mentor, Kathryn Keats, inspired me. I helped her plan a surprise birthday party for her son when I was 12 and she heard about my story. For some reason, she saw potential in me and started training me in performance and songwriting. It was her way of helping me through the chaos I was experiencing at home. I was completely tone deaf in middle school and to this day, I still don’t understand why she decided to take me in. She’s basically my fairy godmother.
DT: What is your songwriting process like?
AC: When I write songs, it’s inspired by a life experience. Some people can just sit down and write just to write, but I just can’t do that. It just kind of seems backward to me. I’ve always believed that I should bring life to my music rather than the other way around. Songs shouldn’t be self-referential. I don’t know if that made sense, whatever. I usually start with a concept or a lyric, then I write chords and lyrics as I go!
DT: How does being Asian-American affect the way you make your music or view the music industry?
AC: Being a first-generation Vietnamese-American pursuing music, I have to understand I’m attempting something that hasn’t really been done before. I want to reach the masses — not to be famous, but to spread a positive message to as many people as possible. It’s terrifying, but it pushes me every day to fiercely work.
DT: What do you hope to accomplish by being an artist?
AC: I want to reach the masses and spread a positive message. My main objective for songwriting is for people to understand that they can be transparent with their story and still be understood, loved and influential. My objective for pursuing music is for people to be brave and follow whatever God has put on their hearts. I am the most anxious human on the planet. I never had “natural talent” and that just adds to my story. I hope people can learn that with faith and hard work, all things are possible. It’s super cliché, I know.
DT: Why did you decide to give yourself the stage name Angela Cross?
AC: I like the weight of “Cross.” It’s just a very purposeful name, which is what I want my music to reflect. If you think of a literal cross, there’s weight, there’s power in it. Also, my real last name is Ho, so…..
DT: What would you classify your genre as and who are your greatest musical influences?
AC: It has always been difficult for people and me to classify my genre. I’d say it’s a mix of soul, alternative rock, pop and hip hop. My favorite artists are Tori Kelly, Kimbra, Kendrick Lamar, Jeff Buckley, Phony Ppl, Etta James and, of course, Queen Bey.
DT: What are your plans for this summer in terms of your music?
AC: I’ll be doing all kinds of shows. Festival, bar, collective, maybe coffee shops and maybe even a backyard show — so many possibilities! Also, I’ll be recording an EP in July while working on improving the songs that I currently have.
DT: How has being at USC impacted your music career? What opportunities have you received from your experience at the University?
AC: I was brave enough to pursue music because of the people I met at USC. In sophomore year, I got my first solo in the Saved by Grace gospel choir and I cried before the show, but I didn’t die! I realized I was capable of being on a stage. Later on, my friends who are engineers decided to host a show for me and through doing more shows, I got connected into the music scene at USC. My friends and the musicians at USC have really pushed me to work harder.

The track and field team qualified 14 athletes in 16 events for the NCAA Championships at the NCAA West Preliminary Rounds held in Lawrence, Kansas, from Thursday to Sunday.
“I was pleased with the overall outcome of the NCAA first round meet,” Director of Track and Field Caryl Smith Gilbert said in a press release. “I thought we did a good job of overcoming all of the circumstances this weekend. I thought we kept our composure daily with five- and six-hour rain delays. We didn’t get to run a preliminary round, but we were still able to come out and win heats and advance to nationals race by race.”
The top 12 athletes in each event earned a bid to compete in the finals on June 8-11 in Eugene, Oregon.
Day one was slowed down by the weather, and few athletes were able to compete. Freshman Nathan Bultman was the only Trojan to step on the field in the men’s hammer throw. Despite coming close to a personal record, throwing 60.02, he wasn’t able to qualify, finishing 27th.
Day two started with sophomore Dominic Smallwood and sophomore Adoree’ Jackson competing in the men’s long jump. Smallwood marked a personal best at 7.50 m that kept him in the race for the finals until the last round of the final flights, when he dropped out of the top-12, finishing thirteenth. Jackson finished third overall with a jump of 7.75 m.
“Dominic had a great PR in the long jump, and although he did not qualify, that was one of my most proud moments this weekend because he has been working very hard,” Gilbert said at the end of the weekend.
Sophomore Kendall Ellis and junior Cameron Pettigrew ran the 400-meter women’s event. Starting together in the fifth heat, they got second (52.91) and third (54.38) respectively. Ellis was the fastest of the non-automatic qualifiers and advanced to the finals. Pettigrew finished sixteenth overall. On the men’s side, sophomore Ricky Morgan Jr. qualified with the eighth time (46.46).
Senior Jaide Stepter and junior Amalie Iuel advanced to the finals in the women’s 400-meter hurdles. Both won their heats in 56.87 and 56.90 respectively.
Iuel was supposed to compete in the high jump as well, but was forced to withdraw as the two events were rescheduled one hour apart and in two different locations.
Sophomore Randall Cunningham finished tied at first place in the men’s high jump as he cleared 2.07, 2.12 and 2.16 with no error.
In the last event of the day, women’s long jump, the Trojans were able to send two more athletes to Eugene as senior Alexis Faulknor leaped 6.02 in her final attempt, finishing eleventh. Freshman Margaux Jones finished sixth with 6.20 marked in her first attempt.
The success didn’t stop there for USC. On day three, Ellis, Iuel, Pettigrew and Stepter set a new school record in the 4×400-meter relay team with a time of 3:26.73, finishing third overall and advancing to the finals.
Senior Tera Novy threw 55.62 in her first attempt in the women’s discus throw, finishing sixth overall.
The 4x100m relay of Faulknor, junior Destinee Brown, sophomore Deanna Hill and redshirt senior Tynia Gaither finished third overall after they won their heat in 44.14 and secured a spot in Eugene.
Hill and Gaither also took part in the women’s 200-meter event. They both marked new personal records at 22.60 (+0.7) and 22.61 (+1.2) respectively. Overall they were second and third respectively.
In the final event of the meet, the men’s shot put, USC had three athletes set to compete. Bultman in his third event of the weekend was joined by freshman Matthew Katnik and sophomore Nick Ponzio. Bultman fouled the first two attempts and decided to step out of the ring for the third one because he wasn’t pleased with the mark, finishing with no valid measure. Katnik threw 18.48 m in his second attempt, only 0.12 m short of the 12th place, finishing 15th overall. Ponzio was the only one to qualify, with his opening mark at 19.05 m putting him in fifth place overall.
“We had a few mistakes along the way, but overall just about everyone that was ranked to make it to nationals did,” Gilbert said. “Our talented freshmen learned some huge lessons about nationals, and next year they will be even stronger and knowledgeable about the process.”
Overall 10 women qualified for the NCAA championships.
“On the women’s side it was one of the best meets of the season, and we have a strong team of 10 women heading to the NCAA final round,” Gilbert said. “We ran some of our best performances of the season this weekend. We are starting to put our races together. I was excited to see some PRs and everyone came out healthy.”

The baseball team may not have qualified for the College World Series, but the Trojans ended their season in style with a commanding 31-9 win over Arizona State on the road on Sunday.
The win gave the Men of Troy a series win over the Sun Devils to wrap up their 2016 campaign, finishing at .500 (28-28) overall and 15-15 in conference play.
Against ASU starter Eli Lingos on Sunday, USC sprayed hits left, right and center — 30 in total, tied for second most in a game in program history. The 31 runs was also the second-highest single game run total in program history, with the record set in a 1959 game against Occidental when the Trojans scored 35 runs.
The Trojans put runs on the board in all but two innings, with 13 of 14 batters reaching base at least once. They scored a season-high nine runs in the fourth inning and also put up four or more runs in the first, second and eighth innings.
Redshirt sophomore Frankie Rios recorded six RBIs and sophomore Angelo Armenta knocked in five runs, each setting career highs. Rios and senior Timmy Robinson each tallied four hits in the rout.
The win gave the Trojans their first series win at Arizona State since 2004. It followed a 6-2 win on Saturday behind sophomore pitcher Mitch Hart, who allowed two runs on three hits in six innings. Freshman Lars Nootbaar hit his first home run of the year that plated the eventual winning run with a 2-run blast in the fifth inning to put the Trojans ahead 3-2. Three runs in the eighth inning — two of which scored on a triple by junior catcher Jeremy Martinez — gave the Trojans even more separation.
USC dropped the first game of the series on Friday. The Men of Troy had an opportunity to grab the win, but, down by a run, could not score in the ninth despite loading the bases with one out, and the 3-2 deficit held as the final tally.
The Trojans wrap up a season in which they failed to live up to heightened expectations after a deep run in the NCAA Tournament last year, their first appearance in the postseason since 2005.
Senior outfielder David Oppenheim was a bright spot for the Trojans this year, leading not only the team, but also the Pac-12 in batting average. Oppenheim hit .387 with 25 RBIs. Oppenheim complemented that with four home runs, one triple and nine doubles.
Oppenheim also led the conference in on-base percentage, getting on-base exactly half of the time.
Just behind Oppenheim with the third-best batting average in the conference was Martinez who hit .376. Martinez also batted in 42 RBIs. He had six home runs, two triples and 18 doubles. Martinez was also third in the conference in slugging percentage posting a .563.
USC also had a strong team showing of conference leaders in RBIs with three players in the top 10. Robinson is fourth in the conference with 46. He is followed by senior infielder AJ Ramirez who has 44 and Martinez is just behind tied for the eighth spot in the Pac-12.

Coming off its best season and first NCAA tournament appearance in five years, things should have been looking up for the men’s basketball program.
Instead, as the calendar flips to June, there appears to be more questions than answers, with two starters — forward Nikola Jovanovic and guard Julian Jacobs — declaring for the NBA draft. Additionally, three more players — guard Katin Reinhardt, forward Malik Marquetti and guard Malik Martin — are transferring and forward Darion Clark graduated a year early.
It didn’t have to be this way. Jovanovic, Jacobs, Reinhardt and Clark were all juniors. Marquetti and Martin were sophomores. Following the Trojans’ devastating loss to Providence in the first round of the tournament, there was a strong sense that this was just the tip of the iceberg, that this team would return all of its players — minus senior forward Strahinja Gavrilovic — and come back with more experience to make a deeper run next season.
But for one reason or another, they all departed one by one, widening the holes that head coach Andy Enfield will have to fill. Jovanovic was the last to go, announcing on Instagram last week that he would keep his name in the draft.
Enfield, who just signed a contract extension through the 2020-2021 season, will scramble to replace three experienced players and three key bench players. Granted, USC has a strong incoming freshman class along with Louisville transfer guard Shaqquan Aaron, but losing both Jovanovic and Jacobs will sting, regardless of their replacements.
The juniors were holdovers from the previous coaching regime, brought on as freshman recruits before Enfield was hired prior to the 2013-2014 season. Yet they chose to stick with USC through the difficult rebuild that Enfield engineered.
“Players like Julian and Nikola that were here as freshmen made a commitment to try to be the reason why USC basketball competes on a national level,” Enfield said in an interview in January. “They’ve done an amazing job of that so far.”
In a season that saw the Trojans jump into the AP Top 25 for the first time since 2008, Jovanovic and Jacobs emerged as leaders, due to both their experience and play on the court. Jovanovic stretched the floor as a 6’11” big man who can not only score inside and grab rebounds but also make jumpers. Jacobs was one of the team’s best defenders, and used his athleticism on offense to create plays and was also good for at least one spectacular dunk a game.
On a roster where half the team consisted of underclassmen, Jovanovic and Jacobs served as calming presences and go-to players. Reinhardt, who was a starter early in the season but came off the bench towards the latter part of the year, also provided this leadership. The redshirt junior, who transferred to Marquette, was also a solid 3-point shooter and a capable defender.
The losses of Clark, Martin and Marquetti, while replaceable, will hit USC’s depth hard. Their reasoning to leave may have been due to the lack of playing time for bench players next season with all five starters presumed to return — the irony being those three would have been leaned on heavily to fill the playing time voided by the various departures.
Instead, Enfield will have to rely on fresh blood much earlier than he would have liked. Aaron, a redshirt sophomore who couldn’t crack Rick Pitino’s rotation with the Cardinals, will probably take Jacobs’ spot in the starting five. Sophomore forward Chimezie Metu, a raw but promising freshman last season, should slide into Jovanovic’s role.
Metu will work in the frontcourt with fellow sophomore Bennie Boatwright, who will see his role increase on the offensive end as a stretch-four. Junior guard Jordan McLaughlin will take on more of a leadership role as their point guard and best playmaker. Athletic junior guard Elijah Stewart, who showed flashes of what he can be last season as both a shooter and an aggressive rim-attacker, will need to be more consistent.
USC’s recruiting class is encouraging, with freshmen De’Anthony Melton, Jonah Mathews, Harrison Henderson and Nick Rakocevic all highly-touted and bound to leave their mark, but Enfield has been here before in terms of having high-potential but young and inexperienced players, and he would prefer to not undergo another rebuild.
Such is college athletics, when the window of success opens and closes depending on how many players unexpectedly declare for the draft, graduate or transfer. The Trojans still have talent and enough returners to remain a legitimate threat in the Pac-12, but losing so many key players after their most encouraging season in years is a big blow nonetheless. For a program trying to find consistent success, the task just got a bit harder.

There is a particularly well-known stereotype about lazy millennials: overweight, underproductive and highly introverted young adults living in their parents’ basement. Parts of this stereotype unfortunately ring true, although the preconception applies now to more than just the exceptionally lazy. According to a Pew Research Center poll, 39 percent of young adults ages 18 to 34 with only a high school diploma live with their parents. 19 percent of college graduates in the same age bracket live in similar conditions. These results, according to the Pew Research Center, represent the highest rate of young adults sharing residence with their parents since the Great Depression.
It goes without saying that there is more to the story than accusations of laziness. Socioeconomic factors contribute as significantly to the housing trends today as they did in the 1930s. When adjusted for inflation, average wages for men in the young adult bracket have fallen 34 percent in value from 2000 to 2014. At the same time, metropolitan centers that play host to increasing numbers of young adults, like San Francisco, have experienced rent 10 percent or over  annual rent increases in recent years. This has the compounded effect of making housing far more difficult to afford for the average millennial, just as similar factors did during the Great Depression. Interesting to note, however, is that unlike during the Great Depression, it does not appear that large-scale unemployment is to blame. Unemployment was at 14.6 percent in 1940; it was at 6.2 percent in 2014 – very nearly at pre-recession levels. It is clear that finding a job is easier now than then, despite similar housing statistics for people over the age of 16.
A defining characteristic that sets the present apart from the past is student debt. According to research done by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, over half of first-time home buyers in 2014 claimed that student loan debt delayed saving for a down payment. The same report noted that for a $10,000 increase in student debt, the probability of living with parents or other family members by the age of 25 increases by about two percentage points. Combine that statement with these facts: while under 50 percent of students took out loans in 1993, just over 70 percent did in 2015. The average debt incurred by each individual’s loans has increased threefold in the same timeframe. For further comparison, in 1993, students and parents amassed roughly $7 billion in student loans. Despite a college student body that was over 70 percent of the size of 2015’s, students and parents had accumulated a combined debt in 2015 that was about ten times the value of 1993’s figure. The resulting conclusion is that the numbers appear to be stacked against millennials, at least as far as finances go.
Taken in total, it genuinely seems that young adults of this generation have it harder in financial terms than the graduates who preceded them. One could chalk it up to laziness, but the facts in this case disagree. A much more likely cause is high levels of student debt coming out of college that is financially debilitating to those trying to move away from home or go to buzzing centers of potential employment. It is not the millennials themselves who are to blame for this specific trend; it is instead the combination of several factors that work against them when trying to find affordable homes in desirable areas. It is little wonder, then, that people who come of age in the 21st century decide to pursue cheaper housing – even at the considerably high cost of having their mothers as their landlords.

USC prides itself on the religious diversity of its campus. According to the website of the USC Interfaith Council, the school hosts more religious student groups than any other American university.  In the wake of the death of former USC President Steven Sample in March, who was a strong advocate for religious involvement on campus, students should consider how they can serve as a symbol of religious tolerance for students at other American universities. Now more than ever, religious minorities on college campuses are in critical need of protection from discrimination.
Sample was a devout Episcopalian who believed that students should grow both spiritually and academically during their time at college. When he established USC’s Office of Religious Life in 1996, he appointed Rabbi Susan Laemmle as its dean, making her the first non-Christian to serve as the head of religion at a large American university. Varun Soni, the current dean of religious life and a self-described “non-ordained Hindu attorney,” succeeded her as the second.
In an interview, Soni shared his thoughts on the role of religion at a secular university like USC.
“The way we interpret secularism is very much the way the United States interprets it,” Soni said. “Secularism means all religions in the public sphere.”
In other words, unless there is a compelling governmental interest at stake, the government cannot restrict Americans from practicing their religion in public or private. This is called positive secularism. It stands in contrast to the more limited secularism established in countries like France, where burqas and other face coverings have been banned in public spaces because the law protecting religious liberty only applies to private worship.
But because of the extent to which Christianity is ingrained into American society, positive secularism means that members of minority religions have to ask for accommodations more often than others. For example, all students have Christmas off. But on April 29, Jewish students who wished to observe the Jewish practice of abstaining from work on the seventh day of Passover had to make special arrangements with their teachers to make up classwork. USC trains its instructors for this sort of situation, but at other schools, students requesting religious accommodations are sometimes dismissed.
On May 10, The Citadel, a U.S. military academy, prohibited an admitted Muslim student from wearing a hijab with her cadet uniform. The decision ended a campus-wide debate spurred in part when a current Citadel cadet made a Facebook post about the request in April.
“It’s unfair to the school having to change rules and adjust to the individual, when the individual could’ve gone to USC without incident,” he wrote.
The disgruntled cadet’s notion that it is “unfair” for The Citadel to accommodate a student’s faith betrays an incorrect understanding of American secularity. The Citadel already accommodates Christian students by providing three Christian chaplain staff and more than a dozen Christian ministries on campus. The Citadel is overdue on its responsibility to ensure that Muslim students can practice their faith at college and should reverse its decision. As it stands, The Citadel is sending Islamic extremists exactly the message they want to hear — that the United States is at war with Islam.
Lieutenant General John Rosa, The Citadel’s president, claimed in a press release that standardizing cadet appearance was part of the “relinquishing of self” required of military trainees. In stating so, he admits that the school’s reason for forbidding the hijab was based on a superficial desire for uniformity, rather than any serious safety concern. The fact is that a uniform is more than sufficient for its namesake purpose. Cadets will never be completely indistinguishable, and wearing a hijab is no less obtrusively individual than having a religious tattoo, allowed in all branches of the military, or a different skin color. It is time for The Citadel to recognize that military uniformity is still subject to the First Amendment protection of religious liberty.
The Citadel case shows that positive secularism remains an ideal and has not yet been translated into practice at every institution. Though USC has strong protections for religious minorities in place, an Annenberg Media Q & A with Muslim students found that they are still subject to stereotyping and derisive comments.
One interviewee reported, “I had a student look at me with my hijab — and I was carrying packages — and he says ‘Boom, terrorist!’”
Clearly, students still have some work to do in ensuring that religious minorities feel comfortable displaying their faith.
An important way of protecting diversity on a deeper level than policy is by promoting interfaith dialogue and collaboration. Soni explains that the best way to counteract religious prejudice is to discuss religion in settings that are non-academic.
“If you take a class on Islam, it’s less likely that you’ll be Islamophobic. But even more valuable than knowing about a different tradition is knowing someone of a different tradition,” Soni said.
Students forge interfaith friendships when they forego the critical distancing practiced in the classroom and talk personally about their own faith.
The Ansar Service Partnership, a Muslim student organization, works to make that happen. Each month, the group partners with a student organization representing a different faith and they volunteer together in the USC area. Then, the students debrief and share scripture passages from their own traditions about the importance of community service. Deservedly, they won this year’s Best Religious Organization Award at the Tommy’s Awards Night in April. Ansar’s work shows that basic human values like compassion and kindness are common to all religions.
Atheists, agnostics and humanists share these values, and they should also be brought into the spiritual fold. The millennial generation is the standard-bearer of “spiritual but not religious,” and students who do not believe in a higher power and do not attend organized worship can be as devout as their religious counterparts in practicing empathy and mindfulness.
According to Soni, USC is one of several American universities to employ a secular chaplain. His name is Bart Campolo, and he advises the Secular Student Fellowship.
Soni notes that the USC Office of Religious Life is “oriented around meaning, purpose, authenticity, significance and identity,” and strives to “be a resource for everyone, regardless of your religious or spiritual background.” The Secular Student Fellowship, for its part, hosts conversations about political issues like racism and sexual assault and invites students to take a rationalist approach to identifying and combating injustice.
In March 2015, the USC Interfaith Council asked students on Trousdale what motivates them. One student wrote, “I believe that there is goodness in all people and beauty in every tradition.” That message is important. Although USC is quite religiously diverse, Christianity holds a great deal of weight on campus. Of the 80 student religious organizations listed on the website of the Office of Religious Life, 60 are Christian. Many of the other faiths are represented by only one or two student organizations, which may not reflect the full spectrum of beliefs within each religious tradition.
USC’s religious minorities need to know that they are welcome. Soni emphasizes that the project of creating an inclusive religious climate on campus cannot be reduced to simply having diverse student groups. Rather, he wants USC as a whole to be a great place to be a religious student.
“If we develop that kind of reputation, I think the diversity part will take care of itself,” Soni said.
A good way to start is by simply talking about religion because prejudice feeds on silence.
It’s interesting to note that since this article was written a Muslim UC student has gone on a killing rampage.  I suppose per Max’s logic {sic} we drove the Muslim to it by not being supportive and understanding enough of his needs.
Do I have this right Max?
I think you’re a little bit confused.  It is Islam that is at war with us, in fact with all infidels.  Always was and always will be so.  Two examples.
1)  Within 300 years of Mohammed’s birth Muslim jihadists (in the name of Allah) and in the quest of building a worldwide caliphate violently conquered almost the entire Middle East and North Africa, substantial sections of Asia, Spain, Portugal, Siciliy and southern France.  The Pope knew the jihadists had their sights set on Rome.  It was only then that he declared the First Crusade.  
2)  Muslim jihadists in their relentless quest to create a worldwide caliphate have killed around 70 million Hindus in their violent conquest of southern Asia.
Now in both these example it is easy to see Islam’s core tenets – dating back to Islam’s first practitioners – killing infidels unmercifully.  Now you seem to think it is due to ant-Muslim sentiment motivating Muslims to kill us, but history proves that all Muslims need is a promise of virgins in paradise to go out and kill infidels.
