When Diana Fonte and Jason Cerin were freshmen, they realized that, unlike other universities, USC didn’t have a fashion magazine. The pair wanted to make a space for students to express their creativity, so they formed Haute Magazine, an art- and fashion-driven publication.
“If you are creative, you need to be able to do that. But a lot of times if you are not like, a film major, an art major, you don’t have anywhere to put that creative energy, because a lot of the organizations aren’t really based in that,” said Fonte, a junior majoring in public relations who serves as the magazine’s editor in chief. “That’s something that we saw a space for, and we wanted to showcase that work, showcase these incredible minds on campus, in the heart of one of the biggest cities in the world.”
Haute Magazine launched its first issue this semester. The organization allows students to produce both visual and written content. The magazine produces two issues per year, and they aim for around 200 pages, even though the current fall issue, their debut issue, is almost 400 pages. Fonte said the magazine’s articles explore the intersection of phenomena/social issues and art. 
“Haute” comes from “haute couture,” or “high fashion,” which came about partly from Fonte’s love of French culture and art. Cerin, a junior majoring in international relations who serves as the magazine’s creative director, believes that the ability to disseminate their work so conveniently has contributed to their success and growth. 
“Just the scale of it and the level of content that we have been able to achieve is something that, in such a short amount of time, is something that we are very proud of,” Cerin said.
The magazine has continued to grow and recently collaborated with Vans. 
The Vans campus marketing manager for USC reached out to Fonte, and told her about the “Spirit of DIY” project, a nation-wide initiative that selects 50 universities across the country, and 10 finalists to participate in a two-day project, which includes a photoshoot. 
Haute was chosen to be the one out of two of the LA chapters. It did a two-day project with Vans, which included a photoshoot with several models, staff and photography production, hair and makeup and a wardrobe styling team for their upcoming issue. 
“It’s a really great opportunity, I think, to show people what we are trying to do here, how we’re trying to give people access to creative opportunities,” Fonte said. 
One part of the process was finding their adviser, Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Christina Bellantoni, who said she was impressed by the mockup issue.
“They presented their idea to me, and they really had done a lot of work ahead of time,” Bellantoni said. “They had a mock-up issue, they had a vision, they had people, they had photographers lined up, they really had done their homework. I thought they were really organized and interesting, so I agreed.” 
In Spring 2019, Haute officially debuted at the Involvement Fair with their newly created mock-up issue and hoped to recruit new members. The issue contained three large features, including a student photographer, a student musical artist and an external fashion designer that Fonte had gotten into contact with. 
Now, the club comprises around 40 members, meets weekly and is composed of four different teams: a writing team, a photography team, a visual design team and a marketing team. 
The theme for Haute’s fall 2019 issue is “Out of Context.” According to Cerin, this idea is about exploring content that may appear different, or may not be perceived as normal in the sense of a fashion magazine, or just art in general. 
Originally, Fonte wanted something more symbolic of L.A. culture, but she felt that the mission was not focused on LA lifestyle, but bringing something new to campus culture: “an elevated art, fashion, cultural representation to USC.” 
In terms of the magazine’s future, the adviser suggests that the two consider their legacy.
“You always have to think about legacy at a college,” Bellantoni said. “Because at some point, they will graduate and they’re going to need people to take over the reins, or it will die … And I think with a student organization, it is the same thing. To continue to have success, they need to recruit people that are as passionate as they are — who are going to help it live on and continue to thrive.”

Students in the School of International Relations helped launch the Global Policy Institute this semester after a year of planning the center, which researches and plans events to inform the USC community on global issues. 
Steven Lamy, a professor of international relations who helped create GPI, imagined the institute would be similar to the Center for the Political Future, which hosts events and programming and sponsors research but focused on international relations issues. 
While Lamy serves as the faculty lead for the institute, he wants the 14 undergraduate fellows who work there to find ideas for programming and events based on what topics students want to learn more about.
The fellows are split into five groups that each  research and plan events around a specific area, including the global economy, climate change and sustainable development, human rights, poverty and human security and global security. GPI plans to add other programs, like a monthly book club to discuss issues. 
GPI has hosted various events this semester, including a crisis briefing on Turkish intervention in Syria, a discussion on Brexit featuring a former member of Parliament Charles Clarke and a roundtable discussion on internship opportunities in international relations and political science. Each week, all of the fellows and Lamy meet to discuss their progress and ideas for future programs and events.
Katie Abrams, one of the lead fellows at GPI, said the fellows try to inform students on global issues that don’t receive as much attention in mainstream media coverage through events, programs, newsletters and articles posted on its website. 
“We’re not trying to look at the top 10 articles on The New York Times and repost them and spread that same information,” said Abrams, a junior majoring in NGOs and social change. “We’re trying to look at … the things that we know about because it’s what we study, but that the common individual that doesn’t pay attention to international relations might not know.”
The institute has also done events on issues like Brexit that are more commonly reported in American media because Abrams said students may have heard the term but don’t understand the issue fully.
Natalia Smith, another lead fellow, said fellows decide to focus their programming on certain issues based on what issues stand out to them during class or on the news. The events help show how theories and ideas taught in her classes can be applied to solve real-world issues, Smith said. 
“Everything I learned in the classroom seems relevant and important to solving these global issues,” said Smith, a senior majoring in international relations and NGOs and social change. “I like that I can be with like-minded individuals who care about these issues, and who also have the intellectual knowledge on these issues to have these debates and conversation surrounding topics that are not only relevant in the U.S. but in the world.”
“It’s not about collecting data for a professor’s research … these are kids that are creating their own entity that they can proudly say ‘I created the Global Policy Institute,’” Lamy said. “And next year’s group can say, ‘We didn’t create it, but we helped it grow in this direction.’”
As the institute grows, Lamy said he hopes to attract more high-profile speakers and see more students from across majors attending the events to learn about global issues. 
Ashley Abadeer, a fellow who leads the poverty and human security team, said she hopes GPI will continue to establish itself on campus and create more concrete goals for its purpose on campus while she is there. By the time she graduates, Abadeer, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she hopes the institute will get more students from all majors interested in learning about and discussing global issues.
“I would want to see that we contributed to changing the culture a little bit at USC and get people out of this bubble and look to care about things that aren’t right in front of their face all the time and to pursue those intellectual conversations about things that are affecting people’s lives outside of their own,” Abadeer said.

MOVE, a campus organization dedicated to social impact in business, has launched a campaign to designate USC as a Fair Trade University, joining hundreds of campuses in a shift toward sustainability and fair labor practices.
Kylie Nealis, campus and community engagement manager of Fair Trade Campaigns, said the campaigns are a grassroots movement led by those in campuses and communities to enact change with the power of their dollar.
“[The Fair Trade designation criteria] are rooted in two main goals, which is to drive impact of Fair Trade products through purchasing, institutional sourcing and to educate,” Nealis said. “Our goal is to really help communities [and] municipalities, then on a college campus level, campuses through their dining and their institutional purchasing [to] transition to Fair Trade.”
The first step to attain a Fair Trade designation is to build a team of five or more members, at least one of whom is not a student, to pilot the campaign. Then the campaign committee coordinates with the college’s dining services to get two or more Fair Trade products into every dining venue. The university must also offer Fair Trade products at at least three campus offices and departments or campus run meetings and events.   
The fourth goal – education – consists of events and initiatives that engage the community to publicize Fair Trade and its mission. Media coverage, educational workshops and informational booths all fulfill this requirement.
Nealis said the fifth step is to pass a resolution signed by the school’s president representing its commitment to Fair Trade. Several schools, including USC, write and pass the resolution through their student government associations before sending it to university administration.
“While these campaigns are student-led and driven, we want to make sure that there’s buy-in from the student body and that the administration recognizes the work that’s been put in,” Nealis said. “[It’s] really important to recognize all that previous work.”
Currently, 142 U.S. colleges and universities have been designated Fair Trade or are working toward a designation. Among the 57 schools that have completed the designation is Arizona State University, one of the largest universities in the nation by total enrollment. Twenty-three California schools, including seven UC campuses, have launched or completed a Fair Trade campaign.
College campaigns typically last between three months and four years, according to Nealis, although the amount of time it takes to attain designation varies widely depending on the size of the school and the number of dining outlets it has.
At UCLA, which enrolls more than 45,000 students, the Fair Trade campaign spanned three years from launch to designation. 
However, MOVE hopes to complete the campaign at USC by the end of Spring 2020. To accomplish the designation on the accelerated timeline, MOVE Vice President of Professional Events Lorraine Ge said the organization will enlist students from outside the Marshall School of Business as well.
“I think that this is a very big school-wide opportunity — you’ll be basically pioneering USC’s sustainability movement toward Fair Trade,” Ge said. “As long as you’re interested in social good and as long as you’re going to be working in a business, you can join.”
Ge said that one of the major tenets of the Fair Trade campaign is using purchasing power to put personal values into practice.
“I think we are the generation that cares a lot,” Ge said. “And I think that because of that, it’s so important that USC students as a whole, like we do what we believe in, and we commit to that I think as consumers nowadays, we’re much more aware of what we’re buying and how supply chains are not always clean, and we’re more conscious — we actually shop more consciously as well.”
According to Nealis, there are hundreds of Fair Trade campuses worldwide. Los Angeles has launched its Fair Trade campaign and would become the largest Fair Trade city in the U.S.
MOVE President Sho Chawla said that while the campaign’s products will cost more than conventional items, he believes   the benefits of supporting Fair Trade outweigh the costs.
“When we approach [the University] about Fair Trade, I think it’s pretty easy to overcome that [price] barrier,” Chawla said. “Right now, I think it’s pretty reasonable for [USC] to support a Fair Trade initiative and show that they do care about the community and the globe.”

By helping themselves to the great variety of breakfast foods along with cups of morning coffee at any USC dining hall, students have depended on millions of farmers and laborers around the world. More than 700 million of them live on less than $2 a day. 
The reality of global poverty and the unfair treatment of workers who are subject to below living wages, child labor and dangerous working conditions internationally has led to the Fair Trade movement. While many universities have made large strides to implement fair trade policies on campus, USC has been relatively absent from the campaign. 
In the past few decades, the decrease of trade barriers across the world has allowed the increased imports and exports and overall economic globalization. As large companies and countries accumulate more wealth, they gain at the expense of those most vulnerable — international farmers, workers and fishermen, especially in developing countries.
In response, Fair Trade was created as a global movement to promote an economic system that provides more opportunities to unfairly treated workers and holds businesses accountable with the vision of fighting global poverty and supporting sustainability. The organization’s funds often help support those in the workforce by providing workers with bicycles, access to schools, health insurance and numerous other resources that many are currently living without. Fair trade depends on individuals making choices based on ethical consumerism and sustainability in their daily lives and business practices.
Functioning as centers of education and change, universities have become major proponents for Fair Trade USA campaigns. In the past decade, major universities in Southern California such as UCLA, Cal Lutheran, Pomona and Loyola Marymount University have run strong multi-year campaigns on campus demanding more fair trade practices by their respective universities. They each completed a five-step process, including developing a fair trade resolution and committing to fair trade education, before becoming a certified Fair Trade University.
Absent from the ongoing Fair Trade Colleges & Universities Campaign is USC, whose declared profile on fair trade is almost entirely untouched. As a major institution in the fourth largest consumer city in the world, the University is far behind in implementing fair trade policies and education. It has a long way to go before catching up with its peers.
While USC’s Procurement Services and Sustainability branch considers ethical purchasing and fair trade groceries, much more needs to be done to address the lack of fair trade products and awareness on campus. To start, dining halls, the bookstore, USC Village shops and other on-campus vendors that sell common goods — groceries, clothing or any handicrafts — can purchase from and support more ethical sources. 
It would not be a difficult or costly change since dining services at other universities were able to use existing budgets to buy fair trade items. In UCSD’s campaign, for instance, a new policy was created that required all future food and vendor contracts to sell 100% fair trade coffee, tea and sugar. In addition, fair trade awareness is not only about product selection, but also representation. To take a step in this direction, the University can work to label and publish where its products have been sourced.
As consumers, students have both power and responsibility of what is consumed and produced. When deciding on their next purchase, students can look for fair trade labels from Fair Trade USA, Fairtrade America and Fair Trade Federation which ensure the companies have met strict and rigorous criteria in environmental, labor and developmental standards. Further, students should demand more fair trade products on campus such as coffee, tea and bananas in the dining halls. 
Beyond individual choices on campus, advocacy still holds the greatest potential for change. Students must get involved in campus organizations and push for the University’s Fair Trade Campaign. In the past, Fair Trade Campaigns were not started by university policymakers, but by student groups who considered the unjust treatment and living conditions of those affected by current trade policies and demanded change.
The Fair Trade Campaign cannot progress unless the public has a deep and holistic understanding of what the movement is built on — justice, sustainability and accountability. It relies on awareness of the interrelation of the global market, empathy and individuals willing to speak out, or simply, consume mindfully. One purchase at a time, a conscientious student can reach halfway across the world and help a family rebuild its home or keep a child in school.

Undergraduate and Graduate Student Governments recently announced a joint proposal to make on-campus eateries CalFresh-eligible. With this proposal, students who qualify for the CalFresh program will have access to purchase food at these locations. This proposal was issued as a response to the GSG survey results that revealed half of the 466 respondents don’t purchase from on-campus eateries because they are overpriced. 
This new proposal not only highlights the need for more accessible food on campus but also provides an optimistic future for bringing more options to students experiencing food insecurity. While the current proposal first starts with Seeds Marketplace on the University Park Campus and Soto Cart on the Health Sciences Campus, the proposal should be expanded to all vendors, especially those in Ronald Tutor Campus Center. 
CalFresh is a federally mandated program that provides low-income students with monthly grocery money of up to $200 per month in Electronic Benefit Transfer cards. Student eligibility for this program is contingent on whether they are approved for work-study or are Cal Grant recipients or members of the Educational Opportunity Program. According to USG, CalFresh-enrolled students will be able to use their EBT card benefits in on-campus eateries. 
Currently, USC provides similar beneficiary programs for food-insecure Trojans. The USC Student Equity and Inclusion Program operates the Trojan Food Pantry, which is located behind Parkside Apartments and open four days a week. The Pantry is open to all students and provides free groceries from Trader Joe’s, Costco, Target and Numero Uno Market to all enrolled USC students. 
The Trojan Food Pantry is the only on-campus resource that provides temporary relief to food-insecure students. However, the location of the pantry is tucked away at the edge of campus, invisible to visitors and residents. 
This poses as an inconvenience that contributes to why resources like these may see low participation. Since its creation in spring 2018, the Trojan Food Pantry has seen 6,111 total visits from 908 total visitors. Additionally, one in three California college students experiences food and housing insecurity, according to California Student-Aid Commission.  
The new USG and GSG resolutions address this very problem, allowing more options, access and convenience for food-insecure Trojans to obtain quality food on campus. This initiative will also instigate awareness and visibility to the low-income student community and provide them with extra support. 
Through its support of this program, USC will not only recognize the ongoing food-insecurity issue but also help those qualified for CalFresh get access to the state benefit program. Therefore, this program should also be extended to more locations on campus. 
For now, it is important to be realistic, but the potential of this proposal does open more opportunities for future development in food accessibility on campus. The resolution is the first step toward something that will ultimately become much bigger.

Our generation wants to create change. We’ve learned from our peers, mentors and history books that questioning authority is often fruitful. At USC, recent events and scandals, climate change and political issues of the past few years have especially encouraged us to speak up for the change we want to see. 
But such inspiration to make a difference comes with negative impacts on our attitudes. While it is good that we are fighting larger-scale issues, we’ve also developed overly critical eyes and an unhealthy tendency to complain about trivial matters. 
There are countless issues that young activists have publicly voiced their opinions about, shaping our culture into one of critical thinking and growth. However, alongside this growth, we have developed a sort of reflex, by looking for what is wrong in every situation. There is a difference between working toward meaningful change and voicing irritation about minor inconveniences.
One recent change affecting USC students, in particular, is the modified line system at Trader Joe’s in the village. Over 400 students signed a petition to bring back the old line system, many expressing frustration on the basis of the idea that the new line system might be less efficient. While such a change has little to no effect on our well-being, there is a disproportionate amount of criticism and frustration with the issue. Even if the new line system does take longer, a few extra minutes in line should not irritate us so much.
Another source of frustration for USC students is the increased patrol of bike-free zones on campus. While the new Trader Joe’s line system is simply a strategy for efficiency, the bike bans are set in place for our safety. Although dismounting may be inconvenient, what’s more inconvenient is accidentally crashing into another bike during the crowded hours in Hahn Plaza. So instead of reverting to the idea that the bike bans are unreasonable and complaining, we should take a step back to appreciate that the rule exists for a reason.
Our tendency to think critically has potential long-term effects on our brains and mindsets. Anyone relatively familiar with the field of neuroscience has likely heard the phrase “neurons that fire together wire together,” which refers to the idea that the pathways which our brains use often are strengthened. In other words, our brains make physical and chemical changes to reinforce behaviors, so criticizing can become the norm over time. 
In today’s political climate, thinking critically is often synonymous with thinking negatively, which means that our brains also learn to strengthen pathways involved with pessimistic thoughts. However, research conducted by positive psychologists including Martin Seligman shows that more optimistic thinking leads to success as well as improved physical and mental health, while pessimistic thinking is a risk factor for depression. Seligman and other researchers have also shown that if we have wired our brains to think negatively, we can also wire them back to be more positive.
From waiting in Trader Joe’s lines to riding to class through the center of campus, there are many aspects of our lives that we could improve by not fixating on minor inconveniences. 
Rather than automatically identifying what’s wrong with a change, we need to first slow down and think about why these changes have been made instead of handing them the power to put us in a bad mood. Of course, we should continue to speak up and fight against significant issues in a reasonable way. However, as we constructively criticize the world around us, we should always consider whether our critical thinking is appropriate and worthwhile so that we do not reinforce habits of pessimism.
